<plain_text><page sequence="1">Filling in the Blanks: Josephus' Version of the Campaign of the Three Kings, 2 Kings 3 CHRISTOPHER T. BEGG Catholic University, Washington, D.C. This article offers a detailed study of Josephus' account of the campaign of the three kings in Antiquities of the Jews 9,29-43 in relation to its Biblical source, 2 Kgs 3:4-27 (as witnessed by MT, two Greek versions, i.e. Codex Vaticanus and the minuscules representative of the (proto-)Lucianic recen sion, and Targum Jonathan on the Former Prophets). After discussion of the respective contexts of the episode in Josephus and the Book of Kings, the article examines in turn the five parallel segments into which the Josephan and Biblical narratives may be divided up. Throughout the inves tigation, special attention is given to the identification of "divergences" be tween Josephus and his Vorlage, as well as the occasions for and effects of those divergences. A concluding synthesis points out, e.g., that Josephus' ac count differs from the Biblical one especially in its "filling in the latter's blanks" — hence the title of the study. My purpose in this paper is to examine Josephus' handling of the Biblical account of the campaign of the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom against Moab as related in 2 Kgs 3:4-27' in his Antiquities of the Jews (hereafter AJ) 9,29—43.2 More specifically, I shall compare Josephus' ac (1) On 2 Kgs 3:4-27 see: J.D.

In the former, the immediately preceding context to 3:4-27 unfolds as follows: notices on the death of Ahaziah of Israel and the succession of his broth er J(eh)oram in the second year of Jehoram of Judah;7 "source notice" for Ahaziah (1:18);8 a bloc of narratives revolving around Elisha's sue cession to Elijah (2:1-24); and opening framework notices for Jehoram (so MT, LXX "Joram", the form I will use in this paper), 3:1-3.9 Directly juxtaposed to 3:3-27, in turn, is the story of Elisha's miracle of "oil mul tiplication" (4:1-7). Josephus' content parallel to 2 Kgs 1:17-4:7 's4/ 95°~27י• Through out this sequence, however, the historian rearranges the above-sketched order of the Biblical source. First, in 9,27 he brings together the (re lated) framework notices of 1:17-18 and 3:1-3.10 After his "anticipa (6) On this subject, see further my monograph, Josephus' Account of the Early Divided Monarchy Monarchy (AJ 8,212-420) (BETL 108; Leuven: Leuven University Press/ Peeters, 1993). (7) Thus MT 1:17ba; BL lacks this synchronism which conflicts with that given in MT (and LXX) 3:1; see n. 9. (8) BL 2 Kgs 1:18 is followed by a plus, 1:18a d, which largely parallels 2 Kgs 3:1-3 (MT and LXX), apart from 1,18d ("and the Lord was very angry with the house of Ahab" which has no equivalent in 3:1-3). On this LXX plus, see Shenkel, Chronology, pp. 68-83. (9) In MT 2 Kgs 3:1, Jehoram accedes in the "18th year of Jehoshaphat". This datum conflicts with the synchronism given in 1:17b (MT), i.e. the "second year of Jehoram of Judah". The "contradiction" is absent in LXX which lacks an equivalent to the synchro nism of 1:17 as mentioned in n. 7. (10) Josephus' equivalent to this sequence evidences a number of omissions vis-à-vis the Biblical version. First, as was noted above (see n. 9), MT 1:17 and 3:1 diverge in their respective synchronisms for the accession of Joram. As was likewise noted, that dis crepancy is absent in 4 Rgns which has no counterpart to the synchronism of 1:17 and which, in both 3:1 and the parallel to this in its plus 1:18a, dates Joram's accession to Jehoshaphat's 18th year (so MT 3:1). Josephus goes a step further by omitting any syn chronism for Joram's accession, i.e., he lacks an equivalent to the chronological indications of both 1:17 (MT) and 3:1 (MT and LXX). Thereby, he avoids choosing between the conflicting data of his sources, just as he frequently does also elsewhere when the royal synchronisms of MT and LXX diverge; see my Josephus' Account (n. 6) p. 140, n. 898; p. 141, n. 908; p. 148, n. 966; p. 151, n. 976. Josephus likewise dispenses, as he does consistently in his treatment of the kings, with the "source notice" of 1:18 (presumably, the reason for this omission is that Josephus is basing himself on the Bible itself, and not its earlier sources). Finally, Josephus omits the qualification appended to the negative judgment on Joram in 3:2, i.e., (his evildoing was) "not like that of his father and mother for he put away the pillar of Baal which his father had made." This last statement does not seem to accord either with 2 Kgs 3:13 where Elisha associates Joram with his parents</page><page sequence="4">92 CHRISTOPHER T. BEGG [4] tion" of the notices of 3:1—3*, Josephus next (9,28) offers a highly com pressed version of 2 Kings 2 from which he eliminates entirely the dou ble miracle story of vv. 18-25." Thus, it is to his version (9,28) of 2 Kgs 2 (in which Joram does not figure as such) that Josephus attaches his parallel to 2 Kgs 3:4-27, i.e., 9,29-43. Accordingly, it is necessary for him to reintroduce the Israelite king at the start of 9,29 with a Wie deraufnahmederaufnahme of 9,27's mention of Joram's accession: . .when Joram took over the throne, he decided...".12 Subsequent to 9,29-43, it is only in 9,47-50 that Josephus comes to present his parallel to the miracle story of 2 Kgs 4:1-7 which, as noted, immediately follows 3:4-27 in the Biblical sequence. In between 9,43 and 47 the historian inserts a three-paragraph segment, 9,44—46. Within this segment 9,44—45 comprises extracts from the closing notices on Je hoshaphat as found in 1 Kgs 22:41-51 (//2 Chron 20:32-21:1),13 while 9,46, which lacks a Biblical parallel as such, serves to re-introduce the figure of Elisha whose deeds Josephus will relate in 9,47-94 (//2 Kgs 4:1-8:15).14 in his rebuff of the king or with 2 Kgs 10:26-27 which relates that, following his assas sination of Joram, Jehu removed a "pillar of Baal" from the temple of that god in Samaria and destroyed it. In its place, Josephus introduces the characterization of Joram as "a man of bold action in other respects" — a notice that serves to prepare his highlighting of the figure of Joram in his version of 2 Kings 3, see below. (11) Josephus' version (9,28) of Elijah's "translation" and Elisha's assumption of his mantle (2:1-18) reads as follows: "Now about that time [i.e., of Joram's accession] Elijah disappeared from among men, and to this day no one knows his end. He left behind a disciple Elisha, as we have already related. However, concerning Elijah and Enoch, who lived before the Flood, it is written in the sacred books that they became invisible, and no one knows of their death." On Josephus' handling of the Biblical episode of Elijah's departure from earth (as well as of the related cases of Enoch's being "taken" by God [AJ[AJ 1,74 // Gen 5:24] and the tradition of Moses' unknown grave [AJ 4,326// Deut 34:6], see: J.D. Tabor, " 'Returning to the Divinity': Josephus's Portrayal of the Disappearances of Enoch, Elijah, and Moses," JBL 108(1989)225-238 and C.T.

(13) BL's parallel to 1 Kgs 22:41-50 stands after 1 Kgs 16:28 as 16,28a h (in B this material recurs in its MT position as well), see Shenkel, Chronology, pp. 43-60. Josephus attaches his own closing notices for Jehoshaphat (9,44-45) to the previous story of that king's involvement in the Moab campaign via the following transitional formula at the start of 9,44: "So Josaphat came to Jerusalem and dwelt in peace, but lived on only a little while after that campaign..." (Note that neither Kings nor Chronicles directly jux taposestaposes Jehoshaphat's dying with his "coming to Jerusalem" after the Moabite campaign as Josephus does here; for his mention of the former item, Josephus is, however, clearly inspired by the closing words of 2 Kgs 3:27 "(the three kings) returned to the(ir own) land"). (14) Our MSS of AJ lack a parallel to 2 Kgs 4:8-6:8; it would appear that something has fallen out after 9,50; see Marcus, Josephus, VI, pp. 28-29, n.a.</page><page sequence="5">[5] FILLING IN the BLANKS 93 AJAJAJAJ 9,29-43 and 2 Kgs 3:4-27 After the above consideration of their respective contexts, I turn now to a comparison of the Biblical and Josephan accounts of the campaign of the three kings themselves. To facilitate my comparison, I divide up the two texts into Five parallel units as follows: 1) Background (9,29— (9,29—31a//3:4~8); 2) Water crisis en route (g,31b-32//3:9-10); 3) Pro phetic consultation (9,33-36/73:11-19); 4) Elisha's words fulfilled (9,37-4(9,37-41//3:2°-25); and 5) the king of Moab's initiatives and their results (9,42-437/3:26-27). I shall now work through these five moments of our episode in their Biblical and Josephan versions in turn. 1) Background (9,29-3137/3:4-8). Within 2 Kgs 3:4-8, one may distin guish vv. 4—6 as a circumstantial introduction of the following story's two leading figures. In particular, these three verses introduce Mesha of Moab (v. 4), recount his revolt against Israel (v. 57/1:1), and cite Jo ram's counter-initiative (v. 6). Josephus rearranges the components of the Biblical sequence in such a way as to highlight the active role of Joram.15 His version of 3:4-6 thus reads: ".. .Joram ("Iaipapoç)16 de cided to march against the Moabite king [see 3:6] ... for he had re volted ... [see 3:5] after paying tribute..." [see 3:4]. Within Josephus' above version of 3:4-6 various peculiarities of con tent and/or wording call for comment. As noted above, he introduces his reference to Joram in 9,29 by recalling that king's accession from 9,27 (Joram decided to advance against Moab upon "taking over the throne"). Josephus cites Joram's antagonist as "Meisa" (Meioâv),'7 a form that stands closer to MT's מיש than to the Maiod of BL 3:4. In contrast to both MT and BL, he designates "Meisa" as "king of the Mo abites" rather than "of Moab".18 MT 3:4 further designates "Mesha" as a "sheep breeder" (נקד); BL transliterates the title, apparently not un (15) Subsequently too, Josephus will accentuate the Israelite's role within the episode; see on 9,32.34. (16) Josephus' name for the Israelite king here is the inflected form of LXX's 'Icopdp. On Josephus' procedure in the inflection of Biblical names that in MT (and LXX) are invariable, see his statement in A] 1,129 in connection with the name "Noah". In MT (and B) 2 Kgs 3:4-27, 3:6 is the only occurrence of the proper name "J(eh)oram", a state of affairs that is often taken to indicate that originally the Israelite king of the story was anonymous. By contrast, L, in line with its expansionistic tendency in the use of proper names, uses "Joram" a total of 4 times in our segment (3:6,7,8,9); see Shenkel, Chronology, pp. 90-100. Josephus aligns himself with L's more liberal use of the king's proper name, citing this 5 times in g,29-43. (17) Thus NN*Marcus; Na (and W) reads Mioàv with the codices MSP. (18) Josephus maintains this terminological preference throughout 9,27-43 (as also in 9,187/2 Kgs 1:1, the initial reference to Moab's revolt).</page><page sequence="6">g4 CHRISTOPHER T. BEGG [6] derstanding it, while Josephus leaves it aside entirely. In line with his practice frequently elsewhere, Josephus interjects a Ruckverweis to his previous mention of Moab's revolt (9,18//2 Kgs 1,1) when now (//3:5) recalling that happening here in 9,29: "as we said before, Meisa had re volted... Thereby, he establishes a greater cohesion between his two separate references to the Moabite revolt than one finds in the Biblical account. Finally, 2 Kgs 3:4b specifies that Mesha's tribute to Ahab had amounted to "100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams". Josephus conflates this double indication with his reference to "200,000 sheep with their wool".'9 2 Kgs 3:7-8 relate the negotiations between Joram and Jehoshaphat of Judah regarding their projected campaign against Moab. Josephus (9,30) makes 3:6b's reference to Joram's "mustering" of Israel the tran sition to this exchange: ".. .collecting his own force, he sent to Josaphat ('IaiacujiaTov)20...". He likewise supplies a motivation for Joram's ap proach precisely to the Judean king on this occasion; Joram does so "since he (Jehoshaphat) had from the first been his father's (i.e. Ahab's) friend (tjHkoç)."21 Joram's (direct discourse) message to Jehoshaphat in 3:7a(3 consists of a statement about Mesha's revolt and a question con cerning the Judean's willingness to join his proposed expedition. Josephus reverses the sequence of Joram's communication, transposing this — as he frequently does elsewhere with the words of Biblical per (1g) Compare TJ's "100,000 fatted cattle and 100,000 rams of the pasture". Note too TJ's inserted specification that Mesha paid his tribute "annually" in its rendering of 3:4b. Josephus lacks an equivalent to this specification. (20) Josephus' above name for Joram's Judean counterpart is his inflected equivalent to the "Jehoshaphat" of MT and the corresponding 'Iiocraxijiàx of B 2 Kgs 3:7a. By con trast, L's 3:7a has Joram send to "Ahaziah" fO/otîaç), Jehoshaphat's grandson (see 2 Kgs 8:25). More generally, MT and B use the proper name "J(eh)oshaphat" a total of 5 times: 3:7,11,12 [bis], 14 (in the last four of these instances L has simply "[the] king of of Judah"), whereas L uses the name "Ahaziah" 3 times in all: 3:7 (bis), g. On the divergence between L (whose "Ahaziah" he takes to be the more original reading) and MT B re garding the name of Joram's Judean colleague in our episode, see Shenkel, Chronology, pp. 100-108. Josephus, for his part, uses the name "Josaphat" a total of 5 times in g,2g-43, i.e., the same number of times he employs that of "Joram"; see n. 16. (2 1) Here the term "friend", which Josephus frequently employs in its Hellenistic/ Roman court sense to designate a category of courtiers or royal favorites (see e.g., 8,215, where Josephus substitutes the expression "his [Rehoboam's] father's friends" for the phrase "the old men who had stood before Solomon his father" of the source text, 1 Kgs 12:6), has the meaning rather of "ally", cf. the Latin formula "socius atque amicus" (I owe this remark to an HUCA reader). The basis for Joram's invocation of the "friend ship" between Jehoshaphat and Ahab lies in the story of the alliance between the two kings against Syria as related in 1 Kgs 22// 2 Chronicles 18 of which Josephus' version stands in AJ 8,3g8-420. We will note a variety of other links between Josephus' versions of 1 Kings 22 and 2 Kings 3.</page><page sequence="7">[7] FILLING IN THE BLANKS 95 sonages — into indirect discourse:22 Joram "asks" (jtapaxakôrv) Jehosh aphat "to be his ally (ouppaxqoat)23 in the war which he was about to wage on the Moabites who had revolted from his rule". Jehoshaphat's response in 3:7b begins with the avowal "I will go up". Thereafter, in language reminiscent of his own earlier words to Ahab in 1 Kgs 22:4 (//2 Chron 18:3), the Judean expresses his solidarity with Joram by means of a triple formula: "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses." Josephus reduces Jehoshaphat's reply to its essential content: "he promised to assist him" (|3oT]0rj0e1v ÛJtéoxEto).24 In addition, however, Josephus amplifies Jehoshaphat's re sponse with an element proper to himself, i.e. (Jehoshaphat also prom ised) "to compel the Idumaean king who was under his authority to join the campaign". Josephus introduces this item with a view to accounting for a subsequent element of the Biblical narrative, i.e., the fact that when Joram and Jehoshaphat eventually do set out against Moab the (previ ously unmentioned) "king of Edom"25 is said to accompany them; see 3:9. In Josephus this anomaly is resolved in advance: the king of Edom will accompany the expedition at the direction of Jehoshaphat, his over lord. Josephus' "solution" here is not, however, it might be noted, with out a certain Biblical warrant. In MT 1 Kgs 22:48, first of all, one reads a notice which RSV translates as "there was no king in Edom [i.e., in the reign of Jehoshaphat], a deputy (נצב) was king".26 Also to be noted (22) On the use of direct and indirect discourse in the writings of Josephus, see: B. Thérond, "Discours au style indirect et discours au style direct dans la Guerre des Juifs de Flavius Josephus," in A. Caquot et al. (eds.), Hellenica et Judaica (Festschrift V. Nikiprowetzky;Nikiprowetzky; Leuven: Peeters, 1986), 193-152; and Pere Villalba I Vanneda, The Historical Method Method of Flavius Josephus (ALGHJ 19; Leiden: Brill, 1986), 89-117. Use of indirect dis course does, e.g., allow, as the above authors note, for a freer reproduction of a character's words than does direct discourse. Josephus' preference for the former in AJ is thus un derstandable given his tendency to paraphrase the Bible's wording. (23) Compare AJ 8,397 "Ahab invited (jtaoexctXcoe) [Jehoshaphat] to become his ally (oupnaxfjaat)". (24) Compare Josephus' version of Jehoshaphat's declaration of 1 Kgs 22:4 in AJ 8,3gg: xoû ôè 'Itoaatjiâxou xf|v (k&gt;r|0aav ejia^/siXapevoi!. (25) Josephus designates the third ruler here in 9,30 rather as "king of the Idumae ans", while subsequently he will use the place name "Idumaea" (see 9,31) in place of MT and LXX's "Edom". Josephus' designation is inspired by the usage of the LXX which, on occasion, does employ 'Iôoupaîa in place of 'Eôtôp, sometimes juxtaposing the two forms in the same context (see, e.g., 3 Rgs 11:14-16). In AJ 2,3, the historian comments as follows when making his first reference to "Idumaea" in the work: whereas Esau called the country over which he ruled by his nickname, i.e. "Adom" ( Aôtopoç), "the more dig nified (oepvoxepov) name of Idumaea ('lôoupa(av) it owes to the Greeks". On the whole subject, see C.H.J, de Geus, "Idumaea," JEOL 26(1979-1980)53-74, esp. p. 55. (26) In BL whose parallel to MT 1 Kgs 22:48 stands after 16,28 as 16:28a (see n. 13), the reference is to there being no king "in Syria" ( = MT "Aram", a misreading of Hebrew "Edom"), and the term נצב is simply transliterated.</page><page sequence="8">g6 CHRISTOPHER T. BEGG [8] is 2 Kgs 8:20 which states that in the reign of Jehoshaphat's son, J(eh)oram, "Edom revolted from the rule of Judah, and set up a king of their own".27 With his appended notice here in 9,30 Josephus thus pulls together and harmonizes the discordant indications of MT 1 Kgs 22:48a (Edom had "no king" in Jehoshaphat's time) and 2 Kgs 3:9 (a "king of Edom" appears as ally of Jehoshaphat and Joram). Inspired by the reference in 1 Kgs 22:48b to the "deputy" who ruled Edom in Jehoshaphat's day, the historian gives us an "Idumaean king" who is "under Jehoshaphat's authority". Throughout 2 Kgs 3:7-8 Joram and Jehoshaphat communicate, it would appear, via messengers, with their actual coming together being simply presupposed rather than related as such; see 3:9. Josephus fills this narrative lacuna by way of a notice he interjects between his version of the first (3:7) and second (3:8) Biblical royal exchanges. This notice reads: "Joram, after receiving such assurances of assistance from Josaphat, took his army and came to Jerusalem and was splendidly en tertained (^£V1o0eiç kafiJtQtôç) by the king of Jerusalem".28 Josephus' in spiration for this inserted item is clearly his own earlier account (A] 8,398) — itself based on 2 Chron 18:2 — of the reception given Jehosh aphat by Ahab prior to their joint campaign against Syria: "when ... he (Jehoshaphat) went to Samaria, Achab gave him a friendly welcome and splendidly entertained (è^évioe kapitpœç) the army which accom panied him, with an abundance of grain and wine and meat...." In Josephus' presentation here in 9,31 Jehoshaphat reciprocates, in his own capital, the hospitality once offered him by Joram's father in Samaria. By means of this insertion, Josephus accentuates the implicit parallelism — already discernible in the Bible itself — between the episodes of 1 Kgs 22112 Chronicles 1829 and 2 Kgs 3. In addition, the insertion allows Josephus to underscore for Hellenistic readers that one of their fun damental values, i.e., hospitality, is equally cherished by Jews.30 (27) Compare Josephus' version of this notice in A] 9,96 with its echo of his reference in 9,30 to the Idumaean king being "under Jehoshaphat's authority": "the Idumaeans revolted from him [Joram] and, after killing their former king who had been submissive to Joram'sJoram's father [i.e., Jehoshaphat], set up a king of their own". (28) Literally: "king of the Jerusalemites" (toiv 'IcQOooWipiuv). Josephus uses the above title "king of the Jerusalemites" in place of the Biblical "king of Judah" also else where in his account of the monarchical period; see AJ 9,112.117.130.177.246.278; and cf. the related designation "king of Jerusalem" (tiûv 'Iepoookuptov) in 8,314.393.411.412:9,17.95; 10,829.

Josephus, for his part, represents the détermina tion of the line of march as a joint decision by the two kings present together in Jerusalem ("it was decided by them"), rather than something simply dictated by Joram.3' In addition, he provides a rationale for the choice of this particular (indirect) route towards the kings' destination: "for they (the Moabites) would not expect them to attack by this road." In place of the Bible's silence on the matter, Josephus here offers read ers a plausible explanation (i.e., the hoped-for benefit of surprise) for the kings' choice of route. 2) Water crisis en route (g,32//3:g—10). Following the above preliminaries, Josephus next relates the advance of the three kings //3:9a.32 In his près entation, however, mention of the "king of Edom" accompanying the other two rulers on their march does not come as the surprise it does in the Bible; this item has been carefully "set up" by Josephus in what precedes (see above). Following 3:9b, the historian goes on to cite the critical water shortage that developed seven days into the kings' ad vance. Once again, however, Josephus takes it upon himself to provide an answer to a question suggested by the Biblical account, i.e., how did it come to such an emergency on a route deliberately chosen by the kings themselves? In his response to that question, Josephus informs us that the expedition found itself unexpectedly bereft of water "because their guides had lost their way". 2 Kgs 3:10 proceeds directly to Joram's despairing statement in the face of the water crisis: "Alas, the Lord has summoned us, three kings, only to be handed over to Moab." Josephus prefaces the Israelite's word (31) Compare Josephus' rewording of the item about what Jehoshaphat and Ahab are to wear into battle against the Syrians of 1 Kgs 22:30//2 Chron 18:29. 111 the former text(s), Ahab issues the following pre-battle instruction to Jehoshaphat: "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your [so MT; 3 Rgns and 2 Par, my] robes". In AJ 8,412 this becomes "Now Achab and Josaphat had agreed that Achab should take off his royal garments and that the king of Jerusalem should take his place in the line of the battle with the other's (so LXX) robe on...". In both instances (8,412 and 9,31), Josephus is intent then on emphasizing the equality and harmony existing between the allied kings. (32) In the text printed by NN*Marcus (which follows the reading of the codices RO) the title used of Joram is "(king) of the Israelites" (compare 3:9 "king of Israel"). In the codices MSP (which Na and W follow), he is called rather "(king) of Samaria". The latter reading has perhaps been influenced by the designation of Jehoshaphat as "king of the Jerusalemites" in 9,31.</page><page sequence="10">g8 CHRISTOPHER T. BEGG [10] with a remark accentuating the urgency of the situation: "and so they were all in torment (àyomâv), Joram most of all."33 Josephus further expatiates on Joram's word itself: "in his distress he cried out to God, asking what bad deed He charged them with that He had led out the three kings to deliver them without a fight into the hands of the Moabite king."34king."34 3) Prophetic Consultation (9,33-36/(3:11-19). In 2 Kgs 3:11a Jehoshaphat responds to Joram's word by asking about the availability of a prophet for consultation. Josephus prefaces the Judean's proposal with mention of his "comforting" the distressed Joram and with a characterization of the former as "righteous" (ôîxaioç). This characterization accords with Josephus' recurring emphasis on Jehoshaphat's "righteousness/justice" throughout his presentation of this ruler.35 At the same time, the char acterization provides a first (partial) answer to Joram's preceding ques tion: the perpetrator of the "bad deed" which the Israelite surmises to be the occasion for their present plight is not "righteous" Jehoshaphat. In formulating Jehoshaphat's actual suggestion to Joram (cf. 3:11a), Josephus makes the Judean king echo his own earlier words to Ahab prior to their Syrian campaign. Specifically, 9,33 states: "(Jehoshaphat) bade (èxékeuae) him (Joram) . .. find out whether any prophet (eï xiç. . . J1Q0(|&gt;fiTqç) had come along with them, 'in order that (ïva) through him we may learn (|xd0co[1ev) from God what we must do'." This recalls the language of 8,400 "(Jehoshaphat) bade (èxékeuoev) him (Ahab) call the prophets if there were any [prophets] (eï xivéç eiot J1Q0&lt;[&gt;f]xcu)..." and 402 "(Jehoshaphat asks Ahab whether there was some other prophet of the Lord) in order (ïva) that we may know (paBaipev) more clearly what is going to happen." Once again, then, Josephus underscores the parallelism between the two military adventures in which Jehoshaphat became involved. 2 Kgs 3:11b records the report of one of Joram's "servants" about (33) The intensity of Joram's distress is, one might suppose, due to his feeling respon sible for initiating an expedition which has ended up in such a predicament for all con cerned. See also n. to. (34) Joram's accusatory question addressed to God here takes on a certain irony in view of Josephus' earlier characterization of him (9,27) as "showing every form of law lessness and impiety towards God". Given that characterization, readers know what it is God "has against" Joram, even if he does not (or feigns not to). (35) See AJ 8,394 (Jehoshaphat is "upright [ôtxatoç] and pious"); 9,16 (Jehoshaphat "enjoyed splendid fame because of his righteousness [ôixatocruvq] and piety toward the Deity"). 35 (Elisha designates Jehoshaphat as "a holy and righteous [ôtxaiov] man"; see below).</page><page sequence="11">[11] FILLING IN THE BLANKS 99 the presence of Elisha on the expedition. In reproducing this notice,36 Josephus replaces the allusive Biblical qualification of Elisha as one "who poured water on the hands of Elijah" with a more definite designation: "the disciple ([ia0qrr|v)37 of Elijah".38 In 2 Kgs 3:12, Jehoshaphat responds to the servant's report by af firming that "the word of the Lord is with" Elisha. Josephus, who con sistently avoids Biblical mentions of the divine word",39 reformulates so as to eliminate the expression also here. At the same time, he gives Jehoshaphat's response a more directive character: "the three kings, at Josaphat'sJosaphat's urging went to him (Elijah)."40 In 2 Kgs 3:13 Elisha addresses himself immediately to Joram, giving his royal visitors no chance even to state their business. Josephus pro vides a more flowing transition between the kings' approach (3:12) and Elijah's outburst against Joram (3:13). In so doing, he first specifies where the encounter takes place: "they came to the prophet's tent; he had, as it happened, pitched his tent outside the camp". Thereafter, he has the royal callers initiate the exchange: "they inquired what would befall the army." In this connection, Josephus further highlights — with a view to what follows where Elisha directs himself precisely to him — the Israelite's role in the royal "inquiry": "Joram in particular asking this ([ictkiota ôè ô TaïQoqioç).41 Following the above — interjected — interlude, Josephus comes to relate Elisha's word to Joram (//^: 13a). The Biblical version of this opens with an obscure question ("what to me and to you?") which Josephus, (36) Josephus uses the same term, i.e. Jtaïç to designate the "servant" as do BL 4 Rgns 3:11.3:11. (37) Josephus employs the term (ra0qrf|ç a total of 14 times in his writings, three of which designate Elisha in his relation to Elijah, i.e. 8,354:9,28.33. Josephus' proclivity for the term (which in the LXX occurs only as a variant in three passages of Jeremiah) un doubtedly reflects its currency in the contemporary Greek philosophical schools whence it found its way also into Rabbinic Judaism with the Hebrew equivalent תלמיד; see K.H. Rengstorf, "5ןתןז0ג»ן", in TWNT 4(1942)392-466, esp. p. 442. For more details on Josephus' usage of the term, see M.J. Wilkens, The Concept of Discipline in Matthew's Gospel (NovTSup 59; Leiden: Brill, 1988) 111-116. (38) Compare the paraphrase of TJ: "who served (דשמיש) Elijah". (39) On this point, see A. Schlatter, Wie Sprach Josephus von Gott? (BFCT 14:1; Giitersloh: Bertelsmann, 1910) 68-69 (Schlatter explains the phenomenon in terms of Josephus' [and contemporary Palestinian Judaism's] emphasis on the divine "law(s)" as constitutive of Judaism). (40) Compare the more assertive Jehoshaphat in Josephus' version of the death of Ahab. In the source (1 Kgs 22:8b//2 Chron 18:7b) the Judean responds to Ahab's charge that Micaiah "never prophesies good concerning me, but evil" (22:8a//18:7a) with a sooth ing interjection: "Let not the king say so". In Josephus (8,403) Jehoshaphat replies to Ahab's word about Micaiah by "asking (xekevaavroc;) that he (Micaiah) be produced". (41) Compare 9,32 pâkiora ôè tôv 'Idiçagov. See also n. 33.</page><page sequence="12">lOO CHRISTOPHER T. BEGG [12] as is his wont in such cases, transposes into a clear statement: "he told him not to trouble him". In 3:13a, Elisha proceeds to urge the king to betake himself to "the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother" (thus MT and L; B lacks the reference to Jezebel's prophets here). Josephus expands on Elisha's injunction, appending an ironic "motivation" to it: "(he told him) to go to the prophets of his father and mother (thus MT L), for they...were true (cdr|0eïç) [prophets]."42 In 3:13b Joram responds to Elisha's invective by simply reverting to his earlier assertion (see 3:10) about the Lord's intended doom for the three kings. Josephus provides the king with a response which seems more appropriate given the urgency of the situation and Elisha's initial rebuff: "he begged him to prophesy and save them."43 In 2 Kgs 3:14b Elisha swears to Joram "As the Lord of hosts lives, were it not that I have regard for Jehoshaphat.. .1 would neither look at you, nor see you". Avoiding the wording of the above "oath formu la",44 Josephus' prophet responds with words that both spell out the meaning of the figurative phrase "neither look at nor see", while also motivating the "regard" Elisha is said to have for the Judean king: "Then he swore before God that he would not answer him if it were not for the sake of Josaphat who was a holy (ootov) and righteous (ô(xatov)45 man." 2 Kgs 3:15 consists of two elements: Elisha's directive that a "minstrel" (מגנן, LXX ijiakkovra) be brought to him plus the notice that the "hand of the Lord" came upon the prophet when the latter played. Josephus incorporates the directive of 3:15a into the narrative of its sequels wherein he likewise introduces a substitute for the (anthropomorphic) Biblical expression "hand of the Lord". His formulation reads accord ingly: "when there was brought to him a man who could play the harp (tjiâkXeiv... kqoç tôv tjKxXpôv)46 — the prophet himself had asked for (42) The irony of Elisha's designating Joram's parental prophets as "true" here is un derscored for readers by the fact that previously Josephus has characterized the prophets of both Jezebel (see 8,318) and Ahab (see 8,402) as ψευδοπροφήται. (43) Compare TJ's rather similar rewording of Joram's response in 3:13b: "Please do not recall sins in this hour. Beg for mercies upon us." (44) Also elsewhere Josephus passes over the wording of oaths as cited in the Biblical record. Behind that procedure likely lies a concern with precluding any possible violation of the Decalogue's prohibition of taking God's name in vain. (45) See the characterization of Jehoshaphat as δίκαιος in 9,33; cf. n. 35. (46) Thus the reading of RO followed by NN*Marcus. Na reads (πρός τον) ψάλλοντα (see BL 4 Rgns 3:15), with the codd MSP (as well as the Epitome of AJ and the Latin translation), a reading which Marcus, Josephus, VI, p. 20, n. 2 qualifies as "forte recte".</page><page sequence="13">[13] FILLING IN THE BLANKS lOl him (see 3:15a) — he became divinely inspired (ëv0eoç Yevôpevoç)47 at the playing of the harp.. 2 Kgs 3:16-19 relate Elisha's inspired announcements to the three kings. The first of these (v. 16 MT) comprises a Botenformel plus a for mulation that reads literally "making this wadi pools, pools" (compare NRSV "I [the Lord] will make this wadi full of pools"). Josephus, in line with his usual procedure in citing prophetic words, leaves aside the opening Biblical "messenger formula".48 He likewise follows (while also further elucidating) BL 4 Rgns 3:16 (literally: "make [pl.] this stream pools pools") in formulating the "announcement" of MT rather as a di rective to the kings: "(Elisha) ordered the kings to dig many pits in (the bed of) the stream (xw xeipciQQCp, BL xov xeipaQQcmv)." In 3:17 Elisha goes on to explicate the promise (MT)/directive (4 Rgns) of v. 16: though neither wind nor rain will be seen, the wadi is to be filled with enough water to satisfy the expedition's human and animal members. Josephus amplifies, attaching Elisha's announcement to his preceding directive as its motivation: "For.. .though there will be neither cloud nor wind (jtveû|1.aT0ç, BL Jtveûpa) nor downpour of rain (liftof), BL vexov), you shall see the stream (jtoxapov)49 full of water, so that both your army and your beasts of burden will be saved (ôiaouiOfjvai)50 by drinking." In 2 Kgs 3:18, Elisha, after calling the promised advent of the water (47) Josephus substitutes this same phrase for the Biblical "hand of the Lord" in his version of 1 Kgs 18:46 ("the hand of the Lord was upon Elijah" in his running before Ahab to Jezreel) in 8,346. He uses the term ενθ(ε)ος a further 5 times: BJ 3,353 (in ref erence to himself); 4,33 (of Vespasian) 388 ("an ancient saying of inspired men"); AJ 6,56 (Hi(Hi Sam 10:6 "the Spirit of the Lord is to come upon" Saul). 76 (111 Sam 11:6 "the spirit of God came upon" Saul). The term does not occur in the LXX, but is much used in profane Greek to denote divine "possession/inspiration"; see e.g., Plato, Ion 534B; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 2.48.1. Josephus' introduction of the term thus serves to heighten the Hellenistic coloration of his presentation, even as it eliminates a a Biblical anthropomorphism. On his use of the word, see: A. Schlatter, Die Theologie des JudentumsJudentums nach dem Bericht des Josephus (BFCT, 2. Reihe 26; Giitersloh: Bertelsmann, 1932), p. 60; and C.H. Holiday, Theios Aner in Hellenistic Judaism (SBLMS 40; Missoula, MT: Scholars, 1977), p. 65. Finally, note TJ's substitution for MT's "hand of the Lord" in its version of 3:15, i.e., "a spirit of prophecy from before the Lord resided upon him [Elisha]". (48) Compare his similar avoidance of Biblical references to the divine "word", see n. 39· (49) Note the variation — which will recur in the continuation of the account — in Josephus' designation for the "stream" here and in 9,35. BL 4 Rgns uses the same term, i.e., ό χειμάρρους in both its vv. 16 and 17. The same alternation, exemplifying Josephus' proclivity for verbal variations, occurs in his version of 1 Kgs 17:1-6. In 8,319 the body of water from which Elijah drinks is called χειμάρρω τινι, while 8,320 speaks of τοϋ ποταμού (the LXX parallel text uses the former term twice; see 3 Rgns 17:5,7). (50) Compare 9,34 (Joram begs Elisha) "to prophesy and save (σώζειν) them".</page><page sequence="14">102 CHRISTOPHER T. BEGG [14] "a light thing in the eyes of the Lord", further promises that the kings will achieve a complete subjugation of Moab. Josephus makes the tran sition to this new promise with a phrase that avoids the Bible's anthro pomorphic reference to the "eyes of the Lord": "nor will this be the only thing you shall receive from God, but you shall also conquer your enemies... The prophet concludes his discourse in 3:19 with an enumeration of four acts of devastation God will enable the kings to perpetrate on Moab. Josephus too has Elisha cite four destructive initiatives that the kings will perform. Of these, the first two agree with the opening items in the Biblical list (capturing the Moabite cities,51 felling of trees52). In the case of the third and fourth items on the Bible's list (stopping up the springs of water, ruining the land's good portions with stones), Josephus rearranges and modifies: "you shall lay waste their country and stop up their springs (Jtqyàç... èpj)Qa§ete; compare BL 4 Rgns 3:19 Jtqyàç... èp&lt;j)Qâ|aTe) and rivers." Finally, as he does frequently elsewhere, Josephus supplies a concluding formula rounding off Eli sha's extended speech: "so spoke the prophet." 4) Fulfillment of Elisha's Words (9,37-41 // 3:20-25). 2 Kgs 3:20-25 recounts the realization of Elisha's double announcement, first the advent of the water (v. 20) and then the devastation of Moab (v. 25), with the battle account of vv. 21-24 supervening. 2 Kgs 3:20 gives a quite concise account of the arrival of the needed water on the day following Elisha's announcement. For the verse's chronological indication "about the time of the morning offering" which would not have been readily understood by Gentile readers, Josephus substitutes the phrase "before the sun arose".53 Josephus likewise elab orates on 3:20's brief reference to the source of the arriving water ("from the direction of Edom") with his notice "the stream (Ô XetpctQQonç, see 9, 35) flowed with much (water),54 for it came about (50 Like MT 3:19 ("every fortified city and every choice city") Josephus has a double qualification of the Moabite sites the kings are to capture: "the fairest and strongest cities". BL 4 Rgns 3:19 reads simply "every fortified city". (52) In 3:19 the reference is to "good tree(s)"; Josephus has Elisha announce that the kings are to "cut down their (the Moabite) fruit-bearing trees" (δένδρα... ήμερα κόψετε; compare ήμερα δένδρα κόπτοντας in the historian's version of Deut 20:1g's prohibition of felling fruit trees during a siege in AJ 4,299). (53) Sc, ad loc. suggests an alternative explanation for the divergence between the Bib lical and Josephan chronological indications, i.e., the historian read the המנחה "offering" of MT 2 Kgs 3:20 rather as החמה "sun". (54) Compare Elisha's prediction in 9,36 "you shall see the stream (τόν ποταμόν) full of water". Cf. the Biblical account where prophetic announcement ("this wadi will be filled</page><page sequence="15">[15] FILLING IN THE BLANKS IO3 that in this region of Idumaea, which was three days'journey away, God had sent a heavy rain."55 Finally, Josephus underscores the fulfillment also of Elisha's promise about the expedition's participants getting suf ficient drink (see 3: i7bp//g,36): "so that the army and the beasts of bur den found an abundance of water to drink." 2 Kgs 3:21 prepares the following battle account with its notice that the Moabites, upon "hearing" of the allies' advance, were "mustered at the frontier". In Josephus (9,38) the Moabites "hear" specifically of the kings' advance "through the wilderness".56 Whereas 3:21 (MT) speaks impersonally of the Moabites' "being mustered" (57,(ויעקו Josephus' for mulation assigns a more active role to the Moabite ruler: "their king at once collected an army and ordered them to pitch camp on the fron tier (èjti t«ùv ôçkdv) .. .".58 Also in what follows Josephus will accentuate the initiative of the Moabite king. To his mention of the stationing of Moabite forces "on the frontier", the historian then appends a rationale for this initiative: "in order that the enemy might not invade the country unperceived." In 3:22, one hears of the Moabites beholding the water on which the early morning sun is shining "red as blood". Once again, Josephus em bellishes in several respects: the "water" is "in the stream" (see 9,38) which itself "was not far Moabite territory" (and hence, one under stands, readily visible to the Moabites). Their perception of the blood colored water takes place specifically "at sunrise" (see "before the sun arose", 9,37) since "just as this time the water looks especially red in the rays of the sun...." 2 Kgs 3:23a notes the Moabites' inference from what they see: "this is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and with water", 3:17) and "realization" ('the country was filled with water", 3:20) are not so closely aligned verbally. (55) S. Rappaport, Agada und Exegese bei Flavins Josephus (Vienna: Alexander Kohut Memorial Foundation, 1930), p. 132, n. 251a cites Rashi's similar affirmation, made in his commentary on 2 Kgs 3:20, that the "water" mentioned in that verse originated in a rain that had fallen on Edom. Rappaport goes on to state: "Raschis Quelle konnte ich nicht ermitteln." W, ad. loc., comments concerning the above reference to the rainfall in Idumaea: "Josephe rationalise suivant son habitude." It is not so clear to me, however, that Josephus' formualation with its explicit mention of God's sending the rainfall should be regarded as a "rationalizing" of the Biblical presentation. (56) Note the verbal echo of 9,31 (//2 Kgs 3:8b): "(Joram and Jehoshaphat decided) to make their advance through the wilderness of Idumaea". (57) In BL 4 Rgns 3:21 there is a plus between 3:21β and bp (MT) which refers to the mustered Moabites "crying out" to which Josephus' version of the verse has no parallel. (58) Thus the conjecture of NN*, followed by Na Marcus, see MT 3:21 על הגבול = BL έπ'ι τοΰ όριόυ. The codd read έπΐ τών όρών about which reading W, ad loc., comments: "...peut-etre la Ιεςοη des mss. est...bonne et Josephe a...commis une bevue qui explique sa glose 'afin que, etc.' " [on this see above in the text].</page><page sequence="16">104 CHRISTOPHER T.

Josephus inserts an advance qualification concerning the mistakenness of their supposition: "they received a false impression concerning the enemy...In then reporting what the Moabites (wrong ly) supposed, Josephus supplies a motivation for the allied kings' (pre sumed) mutual slaughter which picks up on his earlier mention of the water crisis confronting them: "they had slain one another because of thirst",thirst", just as he spells out the cryptic statement attributed to the Mo abites in 3:23a ("this [is] blood") with his "(they supposed) that the river was running with their blood" (aipa aùtoïç Qéorcoç).59 The Moabites' word concludes in 3:23b with their cry, "Now then, Moab, to the spoil!" Here again, Josephus amplifies, underscoring their misapprehensions about the enemy's state, while also highlighting the Moabite king's active and authoritative role (see above): "and so, imagining this to be the case, they they asked their king to send them out to plunder the enemy... ."6° 2 Kgs 3:24 is the account of the Moabites' approach to the "Israelite" camp and Israel's counter-assault upon them.61 Josephus' version con tinues to insist upon the Moabites' deluded state: "all rushing out as if upon booty that waited to be seized, they came to the camp of the sup posedlyposedly dead enemies. And then their hopes proved false, for the enemy62 surrounded them...." 2 Kgs 3:25a records the four destructive measures carried out by the allies in the territory of Moab in accordance with Elisha's announcement in 3:19. Josephus cites the same four initiatives. He does, however, re verse the sequence of the third (stopping up of springs) and fourth (felling of trees). He likewise introduces mention of the source of the (59) Η. Schreckenberg, "Einige Vermutungen zum Josephustext," Theokratia 1(1967-1969)64-75, esp. 69-70, with reference to A] 2,294 ό γαρ ποταμός αύτοίς [i.e., the Egyptians] αίματώδης.. . έρρΰη proposes emending the above phrase to αίματώδους φέοντος. This proposal is reiterated in his Rezeptionsgeschichtliche und textkritische UntersuchungenUntersuchungen zu Flavius Josephus (ALGHJ 10; Leiden: Brill, 1977), p. 109. (60) Also elsewhere Josephus reworks Biblical passages in order to accentuate royal prerogatives/initiatives; see e.g., AJ 8,379//1 Kgs 20:23. In the Biblical verse, Ben-Hadad's servants ply the king with unasked-for military advice, whereas in Josephus their counsel comes in response to a prior royal inquiry. See also 8,385//! Kgs 20:30-31. In the latter sequence, Ben-Hadad's servants take the initiative in proposing that they make supplication to the victorious Ahab and then set out to do so without receiving explicit approval from Ben-Hadad. In Josephus' version, by contrast, the servants speak of approaching Ahab if the king "allows them to go", and it is further noted expressly that "he let them go". (61) On the textual problem at the end of v. 24, see BHS. (62) 2 Kgs 3:24 speaks of the Moabites' advancing against the camp "of Israel" and of the "the Israelites" rising up against them. Josephus' generalizing double reference to "the enemies" (see above) implicitly "corrects" the Biblical wording which seems to leave out of account the fact that Moab's attackers consisted not only of Israelites, but also of Judeans and Edomites.</page><page sequence="17">[17] FILLING IN THE BLANKS IO5 "stones" with which the invaders cover the Moabite fields: they obtain these "from the streams". 3:25b differs markedly in MT and 4 Rgns. The former reads (so RSV) "till only its stones were left in Kir-hareseth,63 and the slingers surrounded and conquered it." As is pointed out by Marcus,64 4 Rgns apparently took the two components of MT's בקיר חרשת as respectively a common noun and a participial form modifying this, and so renders: "... until they left the stones of the wall cast down (toùç X10ouç xoû toiyou xa0r]Qq[iévouç), and the slingers surrounded and smote it" (so B).65 In this instance, Josephus does align himself with the reading of 4 Rgns against that of MT (see, however, below): "(the invaders) razed their walls to to the ground (ta xziyx\ xaGeuov ëoiç èôâtjiouç)". 5) The Moabite King's Initiatives and their Results (9,42-43//3:26-27). The final two verses of 2 Kgs 3 tell of a double initiative undertaken by the Moabite king in the face of the enemy assault, the first unavailing, the second efficacious. 3:26a attributes the king's initial measure to his "see ing the battle going against him." In the face of this realization he at tempts, unsuccessfully, to "break through to the king of Edom," accom panied by 700 "swordsmen". Josephus modifies the Biblical formulation in several respects. What the Moabite king "sees" becomes "the city in danger of being taken by storm." In speaking of "the city" here where Kgs does not, Josephus seems to be evidencing his familiarity (also) with MT 3:25b's "Kir-hareseth" understood as a proper place name; see above. Kgs gives no reason for the Moabite's attempting to break through precisely at the point he does, i.e., "opposite the king of Edom." Josephus, for his part, substitutes a different indication as to where the attempted breakout occurs, while likewise providing a motivation for the choice of this particular site: the king and his 700 men try to "ride through the enemy's camp at a place where he thought the guards would let let them get through." In the same line, he goes on to supply an explanation for the failure of the venture (compare 3:26b|3's simple "but they could not") as well: "he was unable to escape, for he happened on a place that was was carefully guarded." In Kgs, notice of the Moabite's failure to break out (v. 26b()) is fol lowed directly by mention of his "taking his oldest son" (v. 2jaa).

BEGG [18] Josephus (9,43) introduces an element of transition between the two Biblical items which at the same time alerts readers to the portentous character of what is to follow: "Then he returned to the city [see above] and performed an act of despair and terrible necessity (egyov âjioyvœoeœç xai ôetvfjç àvàyx^ç)."66 2 Kgs 3:27a[! describes the "sacrifice" (MT עלה, B oXoxcmxtopa, L o^oxoutokhv) of the Moabite crown prince who is "offered up" by his father "on the wall". This formulation leaves undetermined to whom the prince is being "sacrificed": is it the Lord or the Moabite god Chemosh?67 Josephus, with a view to Kings' subsequent reference to what the allies "see", emphasizes the "visibility" of the Moabite king's initiative: "leading him (the son) up on the wall (èm tô teiyoç)68 so that he he was visible to all his enemies, he consecrated him as a whole burnt of fering (legooQ^oev elç ôkoxcnJTioaiv; cf. L 4 Rgns 3:27a(! àvrjveyxev... oXoxauTiootv)...." The historian further introduces the specification that the sacrifice was offered "to (the) god" (tô) 0e(â). The ambiguity of this specification is pointed up by the divergent renditions of it in the respective translations of Marcus ("to his [Moabite] god") and W ("à Dieu"). Thus in Josephus too the intended "recipient" of the king's sacrifice remains finally unclear. According to MT 3:27b, the sequel to the sacrifice of v. 26b is that "great wrath (קצף) came upon Israel" with the result that the allies with draw "to the land" (לארץ). Ambiguity attaches to this formulation as well: whose "wrath" overtakes Israel — the Lord's or Chemosh's? In any case with its rendering of קצף by petapeXoç "repentance", 4 Rgns seems to transpose into the subjective realm what MT envisages as an extra-mental happening having its source in some deity, whether the Lord or Chemosh.69 In addition, 4 Rgns speaks, in more differentiated terms, of the allies' returning to "their land" as opposed to MT's gen (66) The above phrases "act of despair" and "terrible necessity" occur only here in Josephus. (67) In subsequent Jewish and Christian tradition, the dominant opinion is that the sacrifice was offered to the Lord. See L. Ginzberg, Die Haggada bei den Kirchenvatern. Erster Theil.Theil. Die Haggada in den pseudo-hieronymianischen "Quaestiones" (Amsterdam: no pub.; 1899), pp. 83-86; idem, The Legends of the Jews, Vol. IV (Philadelphia: JPSA, 1936), p. 90; VI (1939), p. 314. (68) The identical phrase occurs in L 4 Rgns 3:27a{). (69) On the understanding of the "wrath" cited in MT 2 Kgs 3:27b, see recently: B. Margalit, "Why did King Mesha of Moab Sacrifice his Oldest Son?," BAR 12:6( 1986)62-63, 76 (Margalit opts for a "psychological" understanding of "wrath" here, see p. 63), and J.B. Burns, "Why did the Besieging Army Withdraw (II Reg 3,27)?," ZAW 102(1990)187-194 (Burns argues for taking the reference "objectively", i.e., as alluding to Chemosh's "wrath" against the allies, see pp. 191-193).</page><page sequence="19">[1g] FILLING IN THE BLANKS 107 eralizing "the land". Josephus' version of the conclusion of the episode aligns itself with that of 4 Rgns in both of its above differences with MT. At the same time, the historian broadly embellishes 4 Rgns' allusion to the allies' "repentance": "when the kings saw him, they felt pity for him in in his necessity (xatgwTEiQav tfjç ctvdyxqg),70 and, being moved by a feel ing of humanity and compassion (jtaBôvxeç àvbpdimvôv... xai èXesivôv),7' they raised the siege...." Josephus' emphasis on the kings' compassionate response to the Moabite monarch's act of desperation serves, it might be suggested, as an implicit response to the claims of contemporary anti-Semites that Jews lacked concern for other peoples.72 Contrary to such allegations, his Joram and Jehoshaphat appear as Jew ish leaders who are indeed touched by the plight of a non-Jew — one who is a rebel vassal and a military opponent at that.73 In line with the 4 Rgns ending of 3:27 (see above), Josephus concludes his account with the notice that the three kings "returned, each to his home (oixeiav)." As noted above, this concluding statement provides Josephus with the "point of attachment" to which he appends his notices on Jehoshaphat's death and burial which occur once that monarch "came to Jerusalem" (see the opening of 9,44). Conclusion I conclude with four summary remarks concerning Josephus' account of the campaign of the three kings in relation to its Biblical source(s): 1) In terms of its textual affinities, Josephus' version of the episode does several times align itself with distinctive readings of 4 Rgns contra MT; see, e.g., his mention of the Moabite "razed walls" (9,41, cf. 3:25b) and references to the kings' change of heart and return to their indi vidual homelands (9,43, cf. 3:27b). On the other hand, like MT and against 4 Rgns, Josephus gives a double qualification of the Moabite cit ies whose overthrow Elisha announces (9,36, cf. 3:19). Similarly, his ref erence to "the city" in 9,42-43 seems to reflect knowledge of MT's read ing of a proper place name in 3:25b, just as his form of the name of (7&lt;נ) Compare AJ 7,193 την άνάγκην... κατοκτείρας (Joab of Absalom). (71) This is Josephus' only collocation of the above substantivized adjectives. (72) As has been amply demonstrated by L.H. Feldman in numerous publications, the refutation of this charge is of considerable concern to Josephus throughout AJ, see, e.g.: "Mikra," pp. 494-496; "Josephus' Portrait of Joshua," HTR 82(1989)351-376, esp. 363-364; "Josephus's Portrait of Hezekiah,"/B/_ 111(1992)597-610, esp. 607-608; "Ahab," esp. pp. 72-73. (73) Josephus similarly accentuates Ahab's kindly treatment of his defeated foe Ben Hadad of Syria in his version of 1 Kgs 20, in AJ 8, 363-392; see my treatment of this passage in Josephus' Account (see no. 6), 211-235, esp. 226-230.</page><page sequence="20">108 CHRISTOPHER T. BEGG [20] the Moabite king ("Meisa") is closer to that of MT ("Mesha") than to 4 Rgns' Mtooa. In addition, Josephus' version shows several affinities with TJ's rendering of 2 Kings 3: replacement of the phrases "who poured water on the hands of Elijah" (3:11) and the "hand of the Lord" (3:15) w*th alternative, clarifying expressions (see 9,33 and 35, respec tively), as well as the reformulation of Joram's response to Elisha's open ing words as an appeal to the prophet (9,34, cf. 3:13). Finally, we recall that in his having Elisha refer to the "prophets" of Joram's mother alongside those of his father (9,34, cf. 3:13), Josephus goes together with MT and L against B which speaks only of the paternal prophets. The above observations seem to suggest that, at least in the case of the "three kings episode", Josephus had available several different text-forms, cor responding to (proto-)MT, "LXX", and (proto-)TJ.74 On the other hand, they do not offer substantive support for the widely held view that in the case of later historical books, i.e. from 1 Samuel on (and thus also for 2 Kgs 3), Josephus depends in first place on a (proto-) Lucianic form of the Biblical text, rather than, e.g., MT or B.75 Thus, for example, we noted that Josephus agrees with MT and B against L in designating Joram's Judean counterpart as "Jehoshaphat" rather than as "Ahaziah". 2) Overall, Josephus reproduces the narrative of 2 Kgs 3:4-27 both in its Biblical sequence and in considerable detail. Noteworthy deletions/ rearrangements of the source material such as one finds in the histo rian's retelling of other Scriptural episodes are absent. That Josephus chose to proceed in this way with our narrative is understandable given its political/military character which — he might well have supposed — his Gentile audience would find readily congenial (as they would not, e.g., the details of the Jewish cultic system material which, in fact, he does tend to abbreviate elsewhere). All the more so might Josephus elect to reproduce the "three kings episode" in extenso seeing that it gave him the occasion to implicitly refute current charges about his people's lack of military prowess76 or concern for non-Jews (see n. 72). (74) Of course, it cannot be definitively excluded that Josephus, here, as elsewhere drew on one single Biblical text different from each of the above three witnesses, even while having affinities now with one, now with the other of these, in formulating his own version. In the case of Kgs at least, however, where Qumran has yielded only fragmentary evidence, the existence of such a text remains just as hypothetical as the supposition that Josephus knew all three of the above witnesses in some (earlier) form. (75) On this view, see the annotated bibliography provided by L.H. ¥e\dman, Josephus and and Modern Scholarship (1937-1980) (Berlin-New York: de Gruyter, 1984) 166-170. (76) On this charge and Josephus' response to it in various contexts of A], see, e.g.: Feldman, "David," p. 141; idem, "Ahab," pp. 69-71.</page><page sequence="21">[21] FILLING IN THE BLANKS lOg 3) What distinguishes Josephus' account from its Biblical source is above all the numerous expansions which he inserts throughout his ver sion (whence the title of this essay "filling in the blanks"). These expan sions are of various sorts. Mostly, they serve to account for characters doing as they do and/or events taking a given course; see, e.g., the ex planation of the presence of the king of Edom on the Moabite campaign (9,30, cf. 3:9). Others fill in gaps in the narrative by explicitly citing some happening which the Bible simply presupposes; see, e.g., the notice on the kings' opening word to Elisha (9,34, cf. 3:13). Still others represent reminiscences of Josephus' presentation elsewhere, his account of the Israelite-Judean campaign against Syria (8,398-420//! Kgs 22 = 2 Chron icles 18) in particular; see, most notably, his inserted reference to Je hoshaphat's "entertaining" Joram in his capital (9,31, cf. 8,398). Finally, certain of Josephus' additions are intended simply to underscore some feature of the unfolding action; see, e.g., his stressing the allies' distress (9,32) and the Moabites' misapprehensions (9,39-40). 4) Lastly, Josephus' version of the three kings' story also evidences various of his habitual stylistic-terminological procedures in treating Biblical source material. Under this heading I would recall the following items: Josephus tends to transpose direct into indirect discourse. He fre quently replaces figurative and/or obscure expressions with clear prosaic equivalents (e.g., "pouring water on the hands of' becomes "disciple"). He routinely avoids, by recourse to alternative phraseology, such Bib lical expressions as the "word" or "hand" of the Lord, as well as the BotenformelBotenformel and the actual wording of oath formulas. Finally, he regu larly introduces cross references (see, e.g., 9,29) and concluding formu las (see, e.g., g,37) which accentuate the cohesion and structuring of his presentation. All in all, Josephus' version of the three kings episode represents, I suggest, a good example of the historian's ability to faithfully convey the substance of a Biblical account while also filling in its narrative la cunae and more fully exploiting its potential for imparting a positive image of Jews and Judaism to an educated Gentile audience, many of whom he could expect to be familiar with and influenced by anti-Semitic slurs.77 (77) I wish to express my thanks here to the HUAC referees whose comments on an earlier draft of this essay have contributed substantially to its improvement.</page></plain_text>
