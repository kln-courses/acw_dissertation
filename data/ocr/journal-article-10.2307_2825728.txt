Many arcane and awesome interactions exist, and one is almost forced to use teleology to explain them. Aside from explanations of reproductive biology aimed at the very young, whose sex instruction starts and sometimes ends with the birds, bees, and flowers, there are few books on pollination for the public. This book is probably the best in English. The author knows the topic and has the ability to write clearly, forcefully and interestingly. An orchid specialist, he devoted a fair portion of the book to those orchids whose flowers mimic the structure of female wasps and whose pollination occurs when the appropriate male attempts to mate with the flowers. Bird, insect, and mammalian pollination vectors are discussed with only passing reference to Von Frisch's work. The sections on fertilization, seed formation, and fruit growth are superficial, but the chapter on the long delay in recognizing the existence of vegetable sex is excellent. There are several defects in the book. Nothing in the text is illustrated. The evolutionary forces in- volved in pollination are not discussed. Most serious is the exaggerated anthropomorphism. I believe myself to be a red-blooded American boy with normal inter- est in human sexuality and a reasonable appreciation of the humorous aspects of sex. I am, nevertheless, badly put off by the statement that "Normal sex among the flowering plants is not copulatory, but oral sex," by the description of the chewing of petals by slugs as a "thoroughly masochistic experience" which "represents love bites," by the assertion that chemical activation of pollen is "foreplay," by the claim that anthers have "erections," and by literally hundreds of equally gratuitous remarks that fill the text. Plants are, I insist, not "sexually satisfied" by pollination, do not have "strong sexual appetites"; nor is pollen "ejaculated." Reading a book with this leitmotif is as boring as viewing several pornographic movies or crawling from one topless bar to another. It isn't that smarmyness is necessarily in bad taste, but it is dull, unimaginative, and downright tedious. And all this tedium is unnecessary, for pollination is a fascinating aspect of the biological world, the author knows the topic, and he is otherwise an excellent writer. RICHARD M.
