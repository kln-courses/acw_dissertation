<plain_text><page sequence="1">WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE AND THE RIGHT OF APPEAL IN ROME By Arthur Kaplan St. Francis College, Brooklyn, N. Y. vite hear a great deal of the Women's ™ Liberation Movement these days, but it is only since 1919 that women have held the suffrage. It is interesting to note that though women did not have the suffrage in Rome, this situation was not due to any consideration of in- feriority but can be traced to primitive re- ligious (and military) ideas. Must we therefore assume that women were not regarded as citizens and that they did not possess the right of appeal, provo - catio, which was limited to citizens? As Fustel de Coulanges has dem- onstrated in La cité antique , in prim- itive antiquity the father of the family was the priest of the domestic religion, the depository of the mysterious rites of wor- ship and of the sacred formulae for prayers. This domestic religion was trans- mitted only from male to male - prob- ably because it was believed that the re- productive power resided exclusively in the father - and a woman participated in it only through her father or husband. At Rome this idea was carried over from the family, first to the curia (a collection of families which had common reli- gious rites, common festivals, and a com- mon hearth), then to the tribe (a col- lection of several curiae with its own altar and protecting deity), and finally to the city, which in turn was a combination of several tribes. Thus in the early, regal period (753-509 B.C.) we find the males grouped into three tribes: Ramnes, Ti- des, and Luceres; and the early city of Rome was thus a union of these three tribes. So it came about that women could not vote in the Curiate Assembly ( Co - mitia Curiata ), a religious organization in which all the male citizens were grouped into thirty curiae , ten for each tribe, nor in the Tribal Assembly ( Comitia Tri- buta ), which ultimately was composed of four city and thirty-one rural tribes. (This latter assembly, first organized ć. 471 B.C. to elect the plebeian tribunes of the people and the plebeian aediles, finally, by the Hortensian Law of 287 B. C., gained the right to pass laws without the consent of the Sen- ate.) Furthermore, women could not vote in the Centuriate Assembly ( Co- mitia Centuriata) because this was at first a military organization, from which women were naturally excluded. It was organized by the sixth king, Ser- vius Tullius, for military purposes, on a timocratic basis, and in effect was the Roman army. Though it had no political function in the regal period, early in the Republic it became a po- litical assembly; it then elected the con- suls and passed laws subject to the ap- proval of the Senate. For the same primitive religious cause women could not hold office. The kings, besides being chief executives, commanders in chief, and chief jus- tices, were also priests of the public hearth and took the auspices. The con- suls, who inherited the imperium of the kings, were thus also priests and had the auspices. Furthermore, the first act of a consul was to offer a sacrifice in the Forum and a few days later another sacrifice to Vesta at Lavinium, whence the Roman Penates had come. (The anthropomorphic goddess Vesta was simply the Fire upon the altar or hearth of the city personified - cf. Ovid, Fas- ti 6.290; in the earlier animistic religion of the primitive city Vesta was the spirit of the hearth in each home.) The other magistracies, such as those of the censors and praetors, originated when the du- ties of the consuls became too burden- some. Thus these officials too exercised religious as well as political functions; that they had certain sacred acts to per- form eliminated women from holding these offices. (The tribunes of the peo- ple were the only ones who did not perform sacrifices, but they were not con- sidered real magistrates.) The members of the Senate, the pa- tres , were at first appointed by the kings. This lectio senātus was taken over by the consuls, but c. 312 B.C., by the Ple- biscitum Ovinium , it was transferred to the censors, who were directed to give preference to ex-officials, making legally binding a custom the consuls had followed. Under Sulla, c. 80 B.C., the Senate was removed from the control of the censors and became exclusively a</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK Page 113 body of ex-magistrates: holders of the quaestorship, the lowest office in the cursus honorum , automatically entered the Senate upon the expiration of their one-year term of office. Because women could not hold office they could not enter the Senate. Since women could not vote or hold office or become members of the Senate the question arises whether they can be considered to have been cives and thus entitled to the right of appeal, which protected only citizens. The right to inflict capital punish- ment was included in the imperium of the king, but even the kings seem to have admitted on occasion that a citizen condemned to death could appeal to the people (Cicero, Rep. 2.54; cf. Va- lerius Maximus 8.11, Dionysius 3.22, and Pomponius, De Origine Iuris 16). Thus the first recorded case of pro - vocatio was by Horatius, who slew his sister because she bewailed her lover, one of the Curiatii: according to law the king, Tullus Hostilius, then appoint- ed duumviri perdue Monis, to try him for murder, parricidium. Horatius was convicted, but the king allowed an ap- peal to the people, assembled in the Curiate Assembly, which reversed the verdict and freed Horatius (Livy 1.26). In 509 B.C., the first year of the Repub- lic, provocado , which Livy calls "unicum praesidium libertatis" (3.55.4), became a constitutional right in capital cases, the first legal limitation on the imperium of the consuls. That year the Lex Valeria de Provocatione, the first law passed in the Comitia Centuriata, gave all citizens the right to appeal to this assembly in all cases where the penalty was death, such as murder or treason. It forbade any magistrate to execute or scourge a Roman citizen without appeal: "ne quis magistratus eivem Romanům adversus provocationem necaret neve verberaret" (Cicero, Rep. 2.53; cf. Livy 2.8.2, Dio- nysius 5.19.4 and 70.2, and Plutarch, Pubi. 11.2). This right of appeal did not, however, apply beyond one mile from the city limits (Livy 3.20.7). The provisions of the Lex Valeria were re-en- acted several times. The Twelve Tables of 451-450 B.C., drawn up by the de- cemviri who replaced the consuls and tribunes in those two years (Cicero, Rep. 2.61-63 and Livy 3.33-59), con- tained a clause concerning provocatio which forbade cases in which the pen- alty, for a citizen, was death or the loss of citizenship to be tried elsewhere than before the great assembly, i.e., the Cen- turiate Assembly: "de capite civis rogari nisi maximo comi tatu vetat" (Cicero, Leg. 3.44). The use of the word caput shows conclusively that neither the death pen- alty nor the deprivation of citizenship could be imposed except after an un- successful appeal to the Comitia Cen- turiata (see Festus s.v. "Deminutus capite"). Since no appeal was permitted from a sentence imposed by the decemviri (Cicero, Rep. 2.54 and 61; Livy 3.33.9) it was deemed necessary, after the decem- virate was abolished, to pass a new law reaffirming the right of appeal. One of the Valerio-Horatian laws of 449 B.C. therefore proclaimed "ne quis magis- tratus sine provocatione crearetur" (Ci- cero, Rep. 3.54). In 300 B.C., 149 years later, there was enacted a third Va- lerian Law de provocatione , followed, probably c. 198 B.C., by the first of three Leges Porciae , of which we know very little. It would seem from Livy, who mentions this Valerian Law and the first Porcian Law together (10.9.3-6; cf. Cicero, Rep. 2.54, Rab. Perd. 8 and 12, and Leg. 3.6), that this Valerian Law prohibited scourging or beheading without appeal but did not have a severe sanctio, while the Porcian Laws added teeth by the sanctio of some severe penalty (cf. Cicero, Rep. 2.54 and Rab. Perd. 8 and 12). This Valerian Law and the Porcian Laws apparently also stated that a person condemned by a magistrate might, if he chose, with- draw into voluntary exile at any time during the twenty-four days required between the sentence of a magistrate and its confirmation or reversal by the Cen- turiate Assembly (Sallust, Cat. 51; cf. Polybius 6.14.6-7; A. H. J. Greenidge, "The Porcian Coins and the Porcian Laws," Classical Review 11, 1897, pp. 437-440; F. F. Abbott, A History and Description of Roman Political Insti- tutions , Boston, Ginn, 1901, par. 159; R. W. Husband, "The Prosecution of Catiline's Associates," Classical Jour- nal 9, 1913-1914, p. 11; and E. G. Hardy, "Some Notable Judicia Po- puli on Capital Charges," Journal of Ro- man Studies 3, 1913, pp. 40 and 53-55). Finally, the Lex Sempronio de Provocatione of 123 B.C. also reaf- firmed provocatio and specifically for- bade the Senate to act as a court or set up special courts, quaestiones extra - ordinariae, to try cases involving the caput of a citizen: "ne de capite civium Romanorum iniussu vestro iudicaretur" (Cicero, Rab. Perd. 12; cf. Plutarch, C. Gracchus 4.1). The Senate thus could not, during the Republic, de- prive any citizen of life or - citizenship without due process of law. Even when the Senate officially declared a person a hostis the implication was only that he was acting like an enemy; the de- claration did not mean that he lost his citizenship. (It may be mentioned in passing that by the Lex Aternia Tar - peia of 454 B. C. cases involving a fine of over 3020 asses could be appealed to the Comitia Tributa [cf. Abbott, op. cit., pars. 67, 160, and 321].) The evidence in regard to capital cases involving women, in Rome itself and not outside the one-mile limit, is as follows. In 331 B.C. many leading citizens died under mysterious circum- stances and a special inquiry by the Senate and the consuls found 170 Roman matrons guilty of murder by poisoning; Livy, who tells the story (8.18), does not relate what followed, but Valerius Maximus says that they suffered the death penalty (2.5.3). In 180 B.C. a praetor, a consul, and many other distinguished men died myste- riously and the Senate instructed two praetors to investigate the matter; the consul's wife was found guilty of mur- dering her husband and was condemned, but we are not told whether she ap- pealed or was executed (Livy 40.37.4). In 152 B.C. an inquiry was insti- tuted concerning poison and two wom- en of high rank were tried before the praetor for the murder of their hus- bands and executed (Livy, Per. 48). These accounts do not exclude the possibility that punishment occurred only after an unsuccessful appeal. J. L. Strachan Davidson believed that be- cause of the absence of any clear case to the contrary we may conclude that wom- en enjoyed the protection of provoca- tio and that the right to vote was not a condition precedent to the right of ap- peal ( Problems of the Roman Criminal Law , Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1912, 1.141-144 and 226). Th. Mommsen, however, believed that women were in the same position as aliens and could be put to death or otherwise punished by the simple fiat of a magistrate {Straf- recht, Leipzig, Duncker and Hum- bolt, 1899, p. 143). In support of this viewpoint there is the statement of Va- lerius Antias apud Gellium (5.19.10) that a woman could not be adopted by a Lex Curiata because women did not have the comitiorum communio, the right to vote: "quoniam et cum fe- minis nulla comitiorum communio est." Greenidge agrees with Mommsen: "It was only the male citizen of Rome that might not be put to death without ap- peal" (The Legal Procedure of Cicero's Time, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1901, p. 398). I too am inclined to agree, even though the evidence is far from conclu- sive, that since women could not vote or hold office they were not regarded as cit- izens and thus were not protected by the laws of provocatio. We have seen that women did not enjoy political rights because these rights go back in primitive antiquity to the ear- ly domestic religion, which was trans- mitted only from male to male. The city was a collection of tribes, the tribes were a collection of curiae, and the cu- ria was a collection of families; in all three groupings this primitive idea con-</page><page sequence="3">Page 114 THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK tinued to prevail. Since women did not possess the comitiorum communio we must come to the conclusion that they were not regarded as citizens and were therefore not protected by provocado, which applied only to male citizens.</page></plain_text>
