<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW TRACTATUS Ο RIG Ε Ν IS. These Tractatus are a series of twenty homilies in Latin, discovered in two MSS (tenth and twelfth centuries respectively) by Mgr. Batiffol, Rector of the Institut Catholique of Toulouse, and published by him in the early part of the present year. Both MSS bear the title Incipit Tractatus Tractatus Origenis de Libris (sacro-)sanctarum Scripturarum conprobatus a a (beato) Hieronimo. In his Prolegomena, Batiffol maintains that the book is substantially by Origen ; and he puts forward reasons which lead him to surmise that the translation is due to Victorinus, bishop of Pettau in Pannonia, who was martyred in the Diocletian persecution, and who is spoken of by S. Jerome as a translator of ' Tractatus' of Origen. The first public pronouncement on the new Tractatus was by Harnack : he was ready to accept Origen's authorship, but regarded the translation as being so free that it would be impossible to determine what was really Origen's and what the translator's. Almost simultane ously Weyman and Morin entered the lists combating the view that the work was a translation from the Greek : Weyman maintained that it was by Novatian; Morin that it was by Gregory of Eliberis, a Spanish bishop of the middle of the fourth century. Zahn, independently it appears, arrived at the same conclusion as Weyman, and Haussleiter has accepted practically this view, while Kiinstle has taken up a position VOL. II.</page><page sequence="2">114 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES akin to Morin's. So the matter stands at present, the purely Latin origin of the Tractatus being decidedly in the ascendent. I had begun to prepare for the January number of the Journal an account and critique of the literary controversy that is going on round the Tractatus, which seems to be of interest not only for the sake of the subject-matter, but also as an example of certain critical methods; when almost at the outset I came across a fact hitherto overlooked, which seems worth communicating at once, as (so at least it appears to me) it is a factor that will have to be taken into account in the settlement of the problem. This new fact is a considerable catena-fragment of Origen, wherein he argues against Anthropomorphism in its crudest form—the very subject dealt with in the first of the new Tractatus. As the passage of the Tractatus about to be discussed is one of those that Weyman has signalised as being closely related to Novatian, I print in parallel columns the relevant portions of the three texts.

That the three passages are closely related is evident. 1. 1. Let us first consider the relationship between Origen and Novatian. I suppose there is no reason in the nature of things why Novatian should not have directly depended on Origen. But it is not necessary to postulate this dependence. The resemblance between the two passages lies solely in the agreement in the Scripture texts cited as being put forward by the Anthropomorphists : there is nothing what ever in common between Origen's refutation (so far as it is extant) and Novatian's. Now Origen tells us in effect that he got his list of texts from the work of Melito which he names, and that he cites only a few texts out of several. It is quite conceivable that Novatian also may similarly depend on Melito. In this case the two writers would have made independent selections from Melito's array of texts, and then have proceeded to refute them each in his own way. This hypothesis on the whole seems more likely than that Novatian used the Origen fragment. 2. There is in this place a very intimate connexion between the Tractator and Novatian. This is shown by the words traduntur and populus liberator,populus liberator,populus liberator, used in connexion with Ex. xxxi 18 and Psalm cxxxv (cxxxvi) 12 respectively, by both writers, though the actual wording of either phrase is not to be found in the Bible anywhere near in the contexts; and by the changes in construction they involve. Indeed, Weyman has shown quite convincingly that in a number of places throughout the book the Tractator is either Novatian citing himself, or else some one freely pillaging Novatian, as he pillages also, though in a less degree, Tertullian and Minucius Felix1. But be he Novatian, or be he another, the Tractator in the passage before us used Novatian's Liber Liber Liber de Trinitate. (It would be easy to show from the various parallel passages that the de Trinitate is the primary text, and the Tractatus the derivative.) 3. That the Tractate depends also on the Origen fragment, in such sense at any rate as that this piece of Origen in the last resort stands Archivfiir lutein. Lexikographie, xi, Heft 4, pp. 545-576 (1900).</page><page sequence="5">NOTES 117 behind the Tractate, is I think capable of proof. It will be noticed that, whereas the order of the Scripture texts in Novatian and in the Tractate is different, the second, third and fourth in the Tractate are precisely those given by Origen, and in the same sequence. Moreover Origen's grotesque argument based on Zach. iv 10 is reproduced by the Tractator, but is not found in Novatian. These traces suffice, I think, to establish the fact that the first Tractate goes back quite independently to the Origen fragment, as well as to Novatian's de Trinitate. 4. The passages here considered do not afford sufficient foothold for formulating or estimating any theory on the general question of the authorship and character of the Tractatus; but if we carefully limit our field of vision to the set of passages before us, and refrain from drawing inferences in regard to the other nineteen Tractates, it may be worth while to consider what was the Tractator's apparent modus operandi in this place. It would seem then that he had in his hands not only Novatian's de Trinitate, but also the Origen fragment, or a translation thereof. He first reproduced the Scripture texts from Origen, and then he copied out the additional ones found in Novatian, inserting on his own account various other texts of the same kind; unless, indeed, it be supposed in regard to these latter texts that the Tractator also was directly using Melito—a possible but not very likely alternative. I think it is possible to trace back to Origen yet a third passage of Tractate I, viz. the argument extending from p. 6, line 12, to p. 8, line 15. If this passage be compared with the close of book i of Origen's Comm. in Rom. (printed below) the analogy of thought and treatment will at once be felt, notwithstanding the much greater diffuseness of the Tractate. Here however a complication comes in : a third passage closely parallel is to be found in S. Hilary's Tract, in Ps. 129, § 6. If the three texts (Origen, Hilary, and the Tractator) be compared, it will be seen at once that they are closely allied. They all are based on the homo interior of Rom. vii 22, and work out the problem of 'the Image of God' by means of a curious antithesis between the homo interior and the homo exterior. The Origen passage (or else perhaps some similar piece of Origen no longer extant) is beyond question the source of Hilary and the Tractator: and it is known that in his work on the Psalms S. Hilary made free use of Origen. But Batiffol has pointed out that throughout this portion of Tractate I there are several close verbal agreements with the above named portion of Hilary. Batiffol takes it for granted practically without discussion that the Tractator is prior and Hilary the plagiariser; and Haussleiter goes so far as to say that this is evident at a glance ( Theol. Literaturblatt). The impression made on me is the opposite. In order to form a judgement</page><page sequence="6">118 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES on the point it is necessary not to rest satisfied with the table wherein Batiffol confronts selected extracts, but to carefully compare Tractate I p. 4,1. 21, to p. 8,1. r5, with Hilary, Tract, in Ps. 129 §§ 4, 5, 6. I think it will be felt that it is much more easy to understand how the Tractate might have been developed out of Hilary, than to see how the disjointed tags of the meandering Tractate could have been picked out so as to fall together into the orderly, logical, thoughtful, and very superior exposition of Hilary. However it is not at present necessary to insist on this point. Any one who compares the three texts will probably be at first disposed to think that the relation is either (according to the view he takes of the priority of Hilary or the Tractator) Origen or Origen Hilary Tractator Tractator Hilary i.e.i.e.i.e. that only one of the two later writers used Origen directly, and the other but mediately. But closer examination shows that this view is untenable; for there is a passage in common between Hilary and Origen (introducing Coloss. iii 9) which is not found in the Tractate; and also a passage in common between the Tractator and Origen (introducing a combined employment of Eph. iv 24 and 2 Cor. iv 16) which is not found in Hilary. This pair of phenomena establishes the fact that, whatever relation there may be between Hilary and the Tractator, they both go back independently, at any rate in part, directly to Origen. As it is important that the evidence on which this position is based should be laid clearly before the reader, the piece of Origen is here printed, and facing it are placed the crucial passages from Hilary and the Tractator; though of course any one wishing to appreciate the nature of the general relations between the passages, must read the whole contexts indicated above. Origen (Rufinus) (Delarue IV, 476) (Comm.(Comm. in Rom. Lib. I, § 19 fin.)

I shall not draw general conclusions from the facts recited, but only indicate various alternative hypotheses, and point out their bearings on the problem under discussion. 1. 1. Even if the Tractator obtained most of the Origenistic element of this passage (pp. 4-8) mediately through Hilary, still he also made direct use of some piece of Origen; and it cannot be determined how much of his matter not found in Hilary may be due to Origen. It is important to keep in mind Rufinus' statement, made both in his Preface and in his Peroration, that in the translation of the Comm. in Rom. he abbreviated and altered Origen. 2. On the other hand, if Hilary derived the common matter from the Tractator, then the latter's indebtedness to Origen must have been very considerable. 1 Col. iii 9. י Eph. iv 34. נ Rom. vii 12. 4 2 Cor. iv 16. ' Col. iii 9.</page><page sequence="8">I20 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES 3. There is another possible hypothesis, certainly not involving greater literary difficulties than the hypothesis that Hilary's exposition was derived from the Tractate : viz. Hilary and the Tractator may both have made independent use of some lost Latin translation of an anti anthropomorphic passage of Origen \ As things stand at present, all that can be said is that, after deducting the portions of Tractate I that may be derived from Novatian and Hilary, it is impossible to surmise how much of the residue may represent true Origenistic matter. Here we look with regret on the tantalising lacuna in the Greek catena-fragment (cf. text printed above), which may possibly conceal the clue to the solution of the problem. In any case, at the least three morsels of Tractate I (the three texts on p. 2, the curious argument based on Zach. iv 10, p. 5, and the combined employment of Eph. iv 24 and 2 Cor. iv 16 on p. 7) have been tracked to definite texts of Origen. This will prepare us to find at any rate a strain of Origen throughout the work; and it may be that Origen stands behind a great deal of it. I hope to pursue further the investigation in the January Number. Postscript.Postscript. During the few days that elapsed between writing the above Note and receiving the proof, I have, by help of the copious Index Index Locorum Scripturae Sacrae attached to each volume of Delarue, examined Origen's treatment of a number of the texts; and I have noticed a few more apparent signs of some connexion between the first three or four Tractates and Origen's writings. And, what perhaps is more important, I have found also that a number of lines in various parts of Tractate III are to a large extent verbally identical with portions of Rufinus' Latin translation of Origen's seventh Homily on Genesis. Thus:— Tractate Tractate III Horn, in Gen. VII p. 26 lines 19, 20 cf. § 1 ? p. 27 lines 8-12 cf. § 3 lines 14-17, 19 cf. § 2 1 Traces of the existence of a Latin translation of the Origen fragment may possibly be detected in the following passage of Augustine against the Anthropo morphitae (Ep. 148, ad Fortunatianum) : ' Nam de membris dei quae assidue scriptura commemorat, ne quisquam secundum carnis huius formam et figuram nos esse crederet similes deo, propterea eadem scriptura et alas habere deum dixit quas nos utique non habemus.' This use of Psalm xc (xci) 4 may perhaps be borrowed from Origen's argument. The continuation of the extract is interesting : it quotes as S. Jerome's a piece found in the Breviarium in Psalmos, which contains yet a third parallel to a passage at the end of our first Tractate which Weyman has already paralleled from Novatian. This anti-anthropomorphic literature seems to be a corner of the History of Dogma that has not yet been worked out.</page><page sequence="9">NOTES 121 lines 21-23 cf· § 3 p. 28 lines 1-7 cf. § 3 p. 29 lines 8-10 cf. § 5 The fact of the plagiarism is incontestable. As before, there seem to be three possible hypotheses :— (1) Rufinus when translating the Homilies may have had before him the Tractate and introduced a few random lines from it. (2) The Tractator, or a Redactor of the Tractates, may have borrowed from Rufinus,—as, on any hypothesis, he did from other Latin writers {e.g.{e.g. Tertullian and Minucius Felix, as is confessed by all). (3) Rufinus and the Tractator may have made independent use of some earlier Latin translation of portions of Origen. From the nature of the case in this particular instance, (1) and (3) seem less likely suppositions than (2): the presumption is strong that Rufinus simply translated, however freely, the Greek text before him. And if this be so, it would follow that Tractate III did not exist in its present form till after Rufinus. This result would call for at least serious modifications in all the theories that have been suggested as to the authorship of the Tractatus. In any case it would seem that theories have been formulated with premature decisiveness before an adequate searching of Origen has been instituted. E. C. Butler. Ε. C. Butler.</page></plain_text>
