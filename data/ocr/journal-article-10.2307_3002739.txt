<plain_text><page sequence="1">Italians in Urban America: A Study in Ethnic Adjustment by Humbert S. Nelli Nearly four million Italians entered the United States between 1890 and 1920, the period of large-scale Italian immigration to this country.1 Contemporaries expressed deep concern about the influx of this alien horde, composed, many claimed, of criminals, paupers, ig? norant peasants and illegal contract laborers, all congregated in closely- packed colonies where they perpetuated old world traits and com? pounded urban problems.2 Scholars and laymen alike still too often ignore or fail to recognize values and contributions of the immigrant community and its institu? tions. Because it served as a staging area where new arrivals remained until they absorbed new ideas and habits which made possible their adjustment to the alien environment, the ethnic community fulfilled a vitally important function both to the newcomer and to the receiving society. It bridged the gap between rural (old world) traditions and the new urban world, and acquainted each immigrant group, from the Irish and Germans of the 1840s and the Italians and Slavs of the 1890s, to the Puerto Ricans and Negroes of the 1960s, with American urban 1.

The Immigrant Community The pattern of Italian settlement in cities east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio began with the founding of the immigrant community by northern Italians, who tended to predominate until the 1880s; after that time, southerners and Sicilians formed the bulk of the new arrivals. The original enclave started in or near the city's central portion?that is, the business area?and was characterized by the movement of economically successful newcomers out of the settle? ment and into the American community. New arrivals from overseas swarmed into the colony, filling vacancies and creating or aggravating overcrowded, rapidly deteriorating negihborhoods. In general, settlement in Chicago typified the Italian experience in urban America.4 Northern Italians, most of them from Genoa, formed the early colony in the years after 1850. Whether from the North, in the first three decades of immigration, or from the South and Sicily after the 1880s, newcomers tended to settle along the same streets and in the same tenement houses according to town or province of origin, probably seeking familiar faces, names and dialects. They lived together and, if possible, worked together.5 This early concentration 3. An opposite view, one emphasizing "cultural heritage," is presented by Ru? dolph J.

In the process, they began to think and talk of themselves as Italians, a considerable expansion of provincial horizons. Not only did they live and work with Italians from throughout the Kingdom as well as with Irishmen, Poles, Germans, Scandinavians and others; they often went to church with these "foreigners" and their children attended the same schools. In contrast to the homeland tradition of seeking a spouse from the same place of birth, they began to intermarry with outsiders. On occasion they married non-Italians. More often they took mates from elsewhere in Italy. Both choices represented a shift from old world attitudes, although of varying significance.6 Continuing the pattern set by their predecessors, southern Italians and Sicilians who obtained the financial means moved away from the colony. Commenting on the later group, a long-time (German-born) resident of the lower north side noted in 1928 that "the good Italians have moved up north and out west, and it is only the rough class that remains along Division Street."7 If migration from the ethnic settlement ?a sign of economic mobility and an indication of desires for better housing and living conditions?did not take place in the first genera? tion, it generally did in the second or third.8 Nevertheless, the continued presence of numbers of Italians in neighborhoods led contemporaries to the erroneous conclusion (not corrected by present-day scholars) that Italians, their children and their grandchildren after them, re? mained on the same streets and in the same tenements from the time they arrived in the city until they died, and that compact, unchanging settlements grouped according to place of immigrant origin.9 While this description might have fitted the first phase of settlement, now relationships quickly formed both with other Italians and with mem? bers of different nationality groups.

Chicago, like other urban areas, had few solidly Italian blocks and even fewer Italian neighborhoods.10a Between 1890 and 1920, only limited sections of certain Chicago streets contained a 60% or higher concentration of Italian immigrants and their children. The population density of Italians in the city's so-called "little Italies" seldom reached 50%. Throughout this period the near west side community in the vicinity of Hull House made up the largest and most heavily concentrated Italian group in the city. According to the City Homes Association Report of 1901 this west side "Italian district" extended from Polk Street to Twelfth Street and Halsted to Canal. Here, while first and second generation Italians constituted 50-70% of the population in portions the size of blocks or slightly more, they comprised approximately one third of the area's total population. By 1920 the major Italian community was located west of Halsted, where similar concentrations could be found.11 This mixing of nationalities made inevitable innumerable contacts among members of different immigrant groups. Italians (and most recent immigrants) appeared to move outward from the urban core more slowly and reluctantly than had Irish, Ger? mans and other older groups.12 The obvious reason was the fact that the "old" elements arrived in Chicago, and in other northern cities, considerably earlier than did the bulk of Italians, Russians, Jews, Poles, Lithuanians and Greeks. The earlier arrivals, therefore, had the op? portunity, as sociologist Richard Ford has pointed out, of profiting economically and socially in cities that had not developed rigid politi? cal, social or financial patterns. "The process of acculturation," noted Ford, "has been going on considerably longer for the Swedish, German 10.

In the early years of settlement, Southern Italians and Sicilians generally moved either from one building or block within a colony to another in the same community, or from one community to another; by the 1920s, however, there was a noticeable and significant movement toward the outlying areas of the city.14 Italian districts began to decline perceptibly during the 1920s because of World War I and the immigration laws of 1921 and 1924, which shut off sources of new immigration. The cumulative effect, as noted by sociologist Harvey W. Zorbaugh in the late 1920s, was that "few Italians are coming to America. . . . The community without any influx from the old country is fast becoming Americanized."15 While the pace of this dispersion decelerated because of depression in the 1930s and housing shortages in the 1940s, it has again accelerated since the 1950s. The old near north side community in Chicago no longer exists, for example. Negroes and Puerto Ricans having replaced Italians.16 At the turn of the century, living conditions in urban areas of the various cities in which Italians (and generally other "new" groups) lived were typically unhealthy, unpleasant and socially demoralizing.17 Many Americans expressed sincere concern over the situation and be? lieved the problems could be alleviated or even solved by encouraging imigrants to move to rural surroundings where greater opportunities surely awaited them.18 Contrary to popular belief, many Italians had 13.

Hygiene is unknown. . . Our people are eternally deeply in debt, . . . and the current agricultural contracts, for share- cropping or renting, are not to the advantage of the Italians.22 Another and more important factor contributed to immigrant dis? taste for farming settlements: most Italians simply did not travel to America with hopes or intentions of farming.23 Like the majority of immigrants, "old" as well as "new," they arrived seeking economic sion, 1896, p. 9; Lodge, loc. cit., p. 468; Jeremiah W.

In the last decades of the nineteenth century and the early ones of the twentieth, prospects of financial gain existed in com? mercial and industrial centers of the North and East.24 In 1919 Robert Foerster, the leading historian of Italian emigration, discussed this fact: A century ago, manufacturing lagged because free land was an alternative to employment. Today . . . industry is a vociferous alternative which tempts away from the farm even the long- established whites and Negroes, and may in the future tempt away the American-born children of the cultivating Italians.25 New arrivals faced the basic problem, then, not of finding agricultural jobs or of escaping from the urban "trap," but rather of settling into their new way of life. The cultural problem of adjusting to new living patterns, the result of moving to an urban environment, constituted a key factor responsible for imjmigrant difficulties in urban America. Contemporaries failed to recognize that adjustment would have been necessary had the villagers migrated to a European city rather than across the Atlantic. Americans of rural background who moved to urban areas faced many of the same problems.26 Significantly, Americans and Italians who encouraged or supported agricultural ventures did so at least in part because of the conviction that foreigners would become Americanized more rapidly and com? pletely in a rural setting than they would in a city.27 Probably the op? posite was true. As the experience of Dutch and German agricultural colonies in Pennsylvania and the Middle West made clear, assimilation slowed or halted in rural environments where contacts with outside agencies and individuals were extremely limited. In sparsely populated 24. America's economic attraction for the foreign-born held true for "old" im? migrants as well as for newer arrivals. See the critique of the Dillingham Report (which argued that motives of "old" immigrants were nobler than economic goals of "new" immigrants) in Oscar Handlin's Race and Nationality in Ameri? can Life (Boston, 1950), pp. 74-110. 25.

The American urban environment had a profound effect upon newcomers of Sicilian or Southern Italian background. In Southern Italy and Sicily (and in Eastern Europe as well) family formed the center of life.29 Needs were handled on that basis, and problems were viewed from the standpoint of the individual or the extended family. E. C. Banfield described a Southern Italian society dominated by amoral familism. Many immigration scholars and students of Italian history accept this description. If it is accurate, then the existence of community and group consciousness among Italians and Sicilians in the United States was not a transplantation from the old country, but a develop? ment of the new world.30 In the homeland, Banfield found peasants and gentry alike unable to act "for any end transcending the immediate, material interest of the nuclear family."31 In the United States (speci? fically, Chicago), one leader of a Sicilian-Southern Italian community described his neighborhood as having "unusual unity and strength," and continued, Perhaps nowhere else in the city is there to be found a neighbor? hood where as many people know each other as they do in our district. We have to a very great extent the same kind of warmth, friendliness and intimacy in our community life that was to be found in the small towns of Sicily from whence our parents came.32 It is ironic that this community life, which developed in response to the American environment, was assumed to be a carryover of old world habits. 28.

People who would not have considered the possibility of co-operation or even of contact with emi? grants from other homeland towns and provinces found themselves forced to deal with urban difficulties as members of a group. In the process, Italians modified familiar institutions (like the Church), estab? lished some with which they had previously had very little contact (such as the press and mutual benefit societies), and organized agen? cies which did not exist in the home country (like the immigrant bank). Thus while some immigrant institutions had counterparts in the old world, Italians either came in contact with them for the first time in America, or recast them in new molds. Because the city prevented isolation, neither the community nor its institutions were fully Italian in character; nor were they American.33 They served an interim group, the immigrant generation with its old world traditions and new world suroundings. Community institutions more closely resembled those established by other immigrant groups in the United States than they did those in Italy. The mutual benefit society, for example, could be found among Poles, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, and Jews, among others. Non-Italian newcomers also established newspapers and depended upon services provided by immigrant bankers and labor bosses.34 Immigrant bankers flourished in every part of the country where newcomers from Southern and Eastern Europe had gathered in any considerable numbers. The principal financial transaction of these bankers consisted of receiving deposits and sending money abroad. Most also served as steamship ticket agents, and often conducted some other business as well. Hence some "banks" were located in grocery stores, saloons, or other natural gathering places. The typical banker operated with a minimal accumulation of capital, had no legal respon? sibility, and, for the most part, acted freely outside legal controls. Because of the conditions under which they functioned, many bankers went out of business, some because they had practiced inefficient busi- 33. Constantine M.

The Bank therefore exerted a strong influence in forcing immigrant bankers to improve services for their clients, modify rates of exchange and lower charges for trans? mission of money.37 In addition, after 1900 various states which con? tained large immigrant populations enacted legislation more strictly controlling immigrant banking operations. In Massachusetts, New Jer? sey and New York, these laws had considerable success. In Illinois, on the other hand, rural American bankers effectively opposed regula? tions which might have limited their own free and easy activities.38 Unlike immigrant bankers, the Church existed for newcomers before they left Italy; yet it, too, had undergone changes in the new world. In comparison with their homeland institution, Italians found the Roman Catholic Church in America to be a cold and almost puritanical organization, controlled and operated, even in Italian neigh? borhoods, by the Irish.39 By 1900 Italians appeared to be so dissatisfied with the "American Church" that many clergy believed the problem posed a serious threat to the Church's future in the United States.40 Protestants and socialists alike saw in Catholicism's difficulties 35.

Some immigrants turned to Protestantism because it seemed to be one road to Americanization. Nevertheless, despite costly and prodigious efforts by non-Catholic churches, relatively few Italians were converted: socialists also found their hopes meagerly fulfilled.41 The tendency of many newcomers simply to turn away from all religious activity constituted a greater menace to the Church than either Protestantism or socialism.42 Un? doubtedly what Father Joseph Schuyler calls "the stress of disorganiza? tion," the impact of migration and the influence of the American environment, distracted many immigrants from traditional organizations like the Church.43 Other newcomers, generally of a liberal persuasion, found distasteful the Church's opposition to Italian unification and its identification with anti-liberal and anti-national forces in Europe.44 Appearances to the contrary, most immigrants remained nomin? ally or actually loyal to the Church, but in their own way. Reflecting the situation in the home country, religion for most Italians in the United States made up an accepted part of life and did not indicate a central aspect of national loyalty (as it tended to be for Irish- and Polish-Americans, for example). It required neither extreme fervor nor public proclamation.

In the same way, critics could consider Italians' addiction to festivals, processions and feasts as a perversion of religion, although to par? ticipants they formed an integral part of it. In America immigrants celebrated these functions not only in an effort to re-establish those elements of religion which had strongly appealed to them in Italy, but also to counteract Irish influences in their new churches.40 Thus what seemed to Americans to be a falling-away from religion was at least in part a modification of old world habits to new world conditions. Prior to 1921, however, the Catholic Church did not occupy the posi? tion of prestige among Italian-Americans that it has since assumed, particularly since 1945.47 Many immigrants sought to solve life's urban complexities by joining mutual benefit groups. These were not, however, "transplanted" institutions carried by Southern Italians and Sicilians to the United States.48 In Sicily and Southern Italy, where strong family ties ensured aid in times of need, group life featured recreational activities in a few social clubs (circolo sociale), most of which had small member? ships and limited community importance.49 The mutual benefit society, although known in Italy, existed almost exclusively among middle classes, and especially among artisans, in the northern and central parts of the Kingdom.50 In the United States, mutual benefit organizations 45.

Fenton shows that "mutual benefit societies were among the earliest institutions organized among artisans in modern Italy," and that these societies were limited almost entirely to urbanized areas in north- rn and central Italy; in addition, the development of labor unions was closely intertwined with mutual benefit groups (pp. 15-16).

These included sickness and death benefits and medical care. Societies also offered companionship, recreation, a feeling of strength through numbers, and a sense of identity in the new environment.51 It is difficult to determine both membership figures and the num? ber of societies in existence,52 because of the basis of group organiza? tion?in many cases, town or province of birth and neighborhood (even street or building) of residence?and the fact that some societies formed with goals other than mutual aid or recreation. Some existed to satisfy political, religious or military functions. Through necessity, small units which had organized on a town or provincial basis con? solidated into, or were absorbed by, larger organizations encompassing all Italians regardless of place of birth or residence. In all these re? spects the Italian experience with societies paralleled that of other nationalities. Thus the merging of small groups into the Sons of Italy had its counterpart in the establishment, for example, of the Polish National Alliance. The function and value of the "colonial" press (as those in Italy and many in the immigrant community referred to it) were temporary, specialized in nature, and vital only so long as a sufficiently large group needed its services.53 Its major significance lay in easing the first critical years of immigrant adjustment to America. Articles about events in Italy and in towns and provinces of origin, news of other immigrant communities, reports of societies and listings of collections for needy newcomers, all helped Italian-Americans to develop and nurture a sense of belonging within their new surroundings.

Thus The Bulletin (later changed to The Interpreter), I, No. 9 (December, 1922), 10, noted that not only did American-born children of immigrants prefer to read American papers, but also "the foreign-born ... as soon as they have acquired sufficient English, turn to the American papers for American and gen? eral news, depending on the press of their language for little more than news of the home country."</page><page sequence="14">ITALIANS IN URBAN AMERICA 51 of expression acceptable to Americans all constituted attempts to lesson adjustment problems for readers. The press served as a crutch for immigrants having difficulties in adapting to their new surroundings, or those unable to break away from homeland traditions. To many of the second generation and a number of more independent new? comers, colonial journals offered little of interest or value; hence reader? ship reached its height during the first two decades of the twentieth century, the time of arrival of great masses of immigrants desperately in need of services which foreign-language newspapers could provide. During this period also, Italian-language tabloids employed technologi? cal advances pioneered by American papers in order to attract atten? tion and hold readership. Immigrant periodicals in the United States bore a stronger resemblance to the popular American press than to homeland journals. Thus they offered headlines, brief articles, special features, simple language and profuse illustrations. Editors who valued literary excellence over sensational news, pictures and frequent pro? testations of loyalty to Italy generally lasted but a short time.54 Like churches and societies, newspapers neither reached nor influenced the entire immigrant community.55 Identification with the colony, and use of its facilities and institu? tions, comprised not only a growth away from homeland outlooks but also, for many newcomers, a vital step in assimilation. It is important to note, however, that Italians exhibited a variety of responses to urban America. Some ignored all community institutions and never expanded their loyalties or interests from the district of origin; even the Italian 54.

Italian publishers used techniques and faced problems much the same as those of other foreign-language press groups. This is seen, for exam? ple, in Thomas Capek, The Czechs in America (Boston and New York, 1920), pp. 172-173. These remarks refer specifically, of course, to the bourgeois press. Anarchist, religious and socialist papers reached a very small and specialized audience. 55. This fact became glaringly evident during World War I. While press and societies actively supported the Italian war effort, most Italian-Americans re? acted with indifference. The average immigrant might have felt some pride in occasional Italian military successes, but he did not believe that he ought to return to Italy to serve in the army. In answer to an Italian complaint that "Mother Italy" needed her sons on the Isonzo, not on the Hudson, the editors of an Italian-language newspaper, La Fiaccola, defended the immigrant attitude (May 5). The paper pointed out that while Italy held "the graves of their fa? thers," newcomers to America had homes and families in the new world and "any number of sentimental considerations" could not offset a natural desire to attend to family needs. That many Italian-Americans were as unwilling to contribute money as they had been to offer their lives showed clearly in press complaints about immigrant reluctance to buy Italian government bonds?see, for example, La Fiaccola, March 18, 1920.</page><page sequence="15">52 THE INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW Kingdom lay outside their comprehension.56 Others made full use of some or all existing community institutions and enlarged personal hori? zons to include Italy, a nation which did not exist for them before their emigration from it.57 A third group preferred to make limited use of press, societies and churches as intermediaries through which to learn American customs and ideas. Often these first generation ar? rivals came as children or young adults and absorbed or consciously adopted American habits and speech in the outside community, from politics as well as in schools, settlement houses and streets.58 From politics Italians gained patronage jobs and neighborhood conveniences like bath houses as well as a voice in the operation of city government. In the early years of settlement, this influence extended only to occasional machine support for Italian candidates for precinct or ward positions, in exchange for delivering the vote for Irish poli? ticians (who generally controlled Italian and other "new" immigrant wards).59 It grew over the passage of time to the control of Italian wards and victories in city-wide elections.60 Social workers reached and influenced many through classes in English, courses in sewing, handicrafts and other activities for women, the support of Italian theater groups, summer camps for children, and the sponsorship of political and social clubs for men. Along with public schools, social workers and settlement houses offered alternate channels of contact with the American community to those provided by Ameri? can political bosses, Italian "prominenti," bankers and padroni. Some reformers sought to establish and support free employment agencies for immigrants and to destroy the padrone labor system, while others 56. Robert E.

While complaining that their own lack of education kept them from getting better jobs, parents sent their offspring out to work in order to supplement family income.62 Although in time most Italians complied with minimum requirements of compulsory education laws, they secured jobs for their children after school hours. When Italian children reached the legal withdrawal age of fourteen, they were "to an alarmingly high degree' withdrawn from school and put to work.63 Despite dire predictions that Italians were caught in a "cycle of poverty," by 1900 they had begun progressing from unskilled labor into commercial, trade and professional classes, including printing, bricklaying, carpentering, import and export, banking, law and medi? cine.64 Notwithstanding complaints of reformers and laments of immi? grant workers, financial success at this time did not absolutely require an education; ambition and cunning could, and did, overcome illiter? acy.65 Crime, one means of economic advancement independent of education, social background or political connections, provided for all classes of Italians opportunities for quick and substantial monetary gain and sometimes for social and political advancement as well. Within the colony bankers and padroni, blackhanders and other lawbreakers all realized small but important profits by swindling or terrorizing com- patritots. The "syndicate," a business operation reaping vast profits from the American community, offered almost limitless opportunities for promotion within its hierarchy. Thus for some, crime offered means 61.

The Irish, for example, were "natural politicians," although a comparison of Irish experiences in other parts of the world would have challenged this belief. Irish immigrants and their children did not achieve political successes in London, Liverpool or other urban centers in England and Scotland (to which Irish immigration was "more numerous though less celebrated" than to American cities) comparable to their achievements in New York, Chicago and other cities in the United States.67 Opportunities for political success were simply not present for Irish immigrants in England or Scotland, and Irish pre-eminence in American political life, like the later prominence of Italians in crime and Jews in the clothing industry, was due primarily to availability of opportunity rather than to inborn characteristics or old world habits.68 Conclusion The process of adjustment began for individual immigrants on their arrival in the United States. The community and its institutions admirably fulfilled their functions for a succession of newcomers. Immi? grant districts were responsible not for perpetuating old world traits and patterns, but for providing vital first steps in introducing newcomers into the mainstream of American life. A residue remained when the composition of an immigrant area changed, but the bulk of an earlier group eventually moved out of the central city rather than live among residents new to urban life. This cycle operated when Poles, Jews or Italians moved into neighborhoods that had previously been inhabited by Swedes, Germans or Irish. Due to the effects of the depression and World War II, this process temporarily broke down, but is once again functioning. The newest arrivals who have driven Italians and Poles from their central city colonies are, of course, Negroes and Puerto 66. John Landesco, Organized Crime in Chicago.

Some of the institutions which earlier groups used now operate among Negroes and Puerto Ricans?press, church, social groupings, for example; oth? ers, like the banker and labor agent, no longer exist. Like their predecessors, Negroes and Puerto Ricans have come to recognize the importance of politics, but have the advantage at the start of American citizenship. In addition to schools and settlement houses a wide range of publicly-supported agencies and programs have been established by city, state and federal governments, not to move the latest newcomers to farms (the mistake of an earlier generation), but to help them adjust to an urban environment. It remains to be seen whether these forces and institutions will be sufficient to overcome disadvantages such as lack of technical schooling and skills (in an age of automation), difference in color, and family disintegration.</page></plain_text>
