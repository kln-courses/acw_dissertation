<plain_text><page sequence="1">A BHANDL UNGEN PEAK CULTS AND THEIR PLACE IN MINOAN RELIGION The least understood of Minoan cult sites are those on, or near, the summit of mountains: the so-called peak sanctuaries. Compared with the remains from cave and domestic sanctuaries, what was found in the sacred precincts sur des hauts lieux is fragmentary and impossible to interpret with certainty or dogma- tism. The sites are exposed to the elements which ensured that little remains to be seen by the casual observer. In many cases, in fact, all traces of religious worship must have vanished, so that there can no longer be any question of accurate statistics regarding the number of peak sanctuaries in use during the Bronze Age. Statistics are of less interest, however, than the knowledge of the kind of cult that obtained in these places, and in what respects, if any, such cult, and the deity or deities involved in it, differed from the worship observed in other Minoan religious sites. The question is obviously important; and while we cannot perhaps yet share Platon's optimism and say that modern research on these peak sanctuaries has already advanced the study of Minoan religion," we are in a position to define some features of peak cult in relation to that in other localities. It is not, however, intended in these pages to give a full account and interpretation of this kind of cult and the exact nature of the deity about whom the ritual revolved. This, alas, cannot be done: theories and conjectures, however finely spun or attractive, are as easily produced as they are refuted. From the time of the first discovery of peak sanctuaries there have been careful archaeological investigations of individual sites and attempts at inter- pretation of the material by scholars like J. L. Myres (Petsophas)2 and Sir Arthur Evans (Juktas).8 In I95I Platon examined all the then known peak sanctuaries, together with the rock shelters.' It was generally believed that this type of sanctuary was relatively scarce, and that it usually was to be found in central Crete and predominantly in the eastern part of the island. Both con- clusions are quite natural in view of the two circumstances that western Crete is still imperfectly explored and, as mentioned above, the millennia of harsh seasons have not dealt kindly with the exposed sites. 1 "Mykenaike Archaiologia", Atti e Memorie del IO Congresso Internazionalk di Miceno- logia, Rome I967, I, 402. 2 Annual of the British School at Athens, 9 (1903) 356ff. 3 Journal of Hellenic Studies 21 (I901) 121f.; Palace of Minos, London 1921, 1, I54ff.

DIETRICH Yet it is an error, in the case of the simple rural shrines, whether in the plain or constructed on a mountain top, to argue about the frequency, or other- wise, of their occurrence from the absence of any physically identifiable signs. On the contrary, one would suppose that there were many such open cult localities scattered throughout the island, and, as Schachermeyr puts it, that each larger centre or settlement possessed its own mountain peak sanctuary., In fact, such sanctuaries continue to be discovered, and their known number appears to increase in proportion to the progress of Cretan archaeology. Up to date two only have been discovered in the west, but the overall number of known sanctuaries has grown to twenty-seven. Most of these are still tobe found in the eastern part of Crete. They are at Petsophas, Modhi,Piskoke- phalo, Plagia, Traostalos, Sphakia, Skopi, Epano Zakro (two sites?), Itia, Ai Ilia, Xykephalo, Koprokephala and Kavousi. In central Crete and in the Mallia region the following sites have so far been discovered: Juktas, Choudetsi, Pyrgos, Maza (Kalo Chorio), Mochos, Askoi, Karphi and Prophetis Elias. The peak sanctuaries in south Crete are Kophinas, Kumasa, Christos(Aphendi Chris- tou), while the two western examples are at Vrysinas and Arkuseliana.6 The two richest and best known sites perhaps are those on Mt. Juktas, south of Knossos, and at Petsophas, on the eastern shore of Crete near Palai- kastro. The Juktas sanctuary was excavated by Sir Arthur Evans.7 The sacred precinct lay on the north peak of the mountain range in such clear view of Knossos, that "it dominates . . . the whole Central Court of the Palace". The sanctuary itself was surrounded by a massive temenos wall constructed of Cyclopean blocks, in the crevices of which there are still the remains of M. M. I sherds showing that the wall was built before the first palace at Knossos.8 Of the first sanctuary (M. M. I), within the precinct, nothing is left. But its site is marked by a stratum of grey ash, immediately overlying the rock, with ceramic remains from M. M. I and II. Above this there is a layer of reddish burnt earth concealing M. M. III pottery fragments and surrounding the foundations of the later sanctuary which perhaps was built as late as L. M. I.9 The latter was constructed of ashlar blocks and consisted of a rectan- gular room (Bi) whose floor concealed some sacred deposits. This room was flanked on one of its long sides by a smaller chamber (B2), probably a store 6 F.

Figures of oxen and goats were also found, together with clay locks of human hair, a limestone 'ladle', and separate limbs, occasionally with perforations for suspension, of both humans and animals. The history of the Petsophas sanctuary is very similar to that of Juktas.1 In the temenos, below a layer of black earth mixed with much ash and charcoal, a stratum of reddish earth also gives evidence of burnt offerings or sacrifice.12 The black earth layer (M. M. I) itself was covered by a layer of disturbed earth of the same date and marking the level of the sanctuary building which matched that of Juktas. One addition to the inner chamber at Petsophas, however, appears to be a plaster bench built against three sides of the room. The earth layers here, again, contained a great many votive terracotta figurines which re- call those of Juktas and are contemporarv with M. M. I.13 The figures are those of human males and females, of animals, and, amongst others, they include sep- arate limbs. The latter, also occasionally perforated, are composed of severed heads, legs and arms, or even of bodies "cloven from crown to fork". The animal figures, again, included, apart from oxeni, goats and ranms, tortoises, hedgehogs, sometimes "mere vermin" like weasels. Of great interest, too, are examples of bull horns, and one object which looks surprisingly like a part of a stalagmite.14 An examination of these two, and other, sites reveals that by and large all of them conformed to the same dates of construction and usage, roughly throughout Middle Minoan. The plan of their temenos and sanctuary generally was the same. Further, in all instances similar offerings were acceptable, includ- ing male and female human figurines, and figures of animals, such as goats, oxen, rams and birds, as well as oxe or bull horns. Among these ex votos, com- mon to all Cretan cult localities, two types appear to be unique to peak sanc- tuaries: the separate limbs and parts of the body from Juktas and Petsophas, and the great range of animal figures including such lowly creatures as pigs and stoats or weasels. It is, of course, impossible confidently to assert that these two kinds of offerings belonged to the ritual of all peak sanctuaries, because not enough remains in a number of these to reach any conclusion either way. In view, however, of the similarity of cultic structures in these sanctuaries, such offerings probably were not confined to Juktas and Petsophas, 10 Pal. of Min. 1, I57, fig. 114. 11 B. S.

Perhaps the separate terracotta legs, uncovered at the Upper Zakro site, should be counted among this type of offering"' as must, indeed, the naturalistic models of the rhinoceros beetle from Piskokephalo.16 One other point that should be mentioned here is the close similarity of the Juktas sanctuary and, by implication, of that at Petsophas and other sites to domestic shrines. The sanctuary building at Juktas, in fact, apparently reproduced the typical pre-palatial early Cretan and Aegean dwelling." The most significant bond which, as it were, unites all peak sanctuaries is the temporal limit of occupation. Cult generally began in M. M. I and extended over the Middle Minoan period,18 occasionally overlapping with L. M. I, when the majority of the sites appear to have been abandoned. Thus the last sanctu- ary on Mt. Juktas may have been built in L. M. I,19 while cult at Petsophas, too, may have endured into the first period of Late Mirnoan.20 L. M. pottery from Modhi2' tells a similar story of a slight overlapping of occupation with Late Minoan, and the same can be said of Kophinas in southern Crete." Exceptions to the rule seem to be the sanctuary at Epano Zakro where, apart from the M. M. figurines, L. M. IIIA pottery was found,23 and the site at Kumasa with a sanctuary whose second phase Platon dates at L. M. IIIB.24 Karphi, too, is a special case, since it probably served as a peak sanctuary during Middle Minoan,2 but much later became a sub-Minoan settlement, a kind of Kresphygeton, or refuge, in troubled times, with its own typically domestic shrine2" containing a shelf or ledge along one of its walls to hold the offerings.27 To what extent did the inhabitants in sub-Minoan utilize the remains of the older sanctuary for their new shrine? Any answer is naturally speculative, but the Karphi example suggests two possible conclusions: either, at the end of the Bronze Age, all memory of the spot's sacredness had become extinct, a less than likely theory in view of the subsequent history of e. g. Juktas, or L. M. domestic cult was compatible, so to speak, with M. M. peak cult. 15 Cf. Nilsson, op.cit. (see n. 8) 7I. I' See R. W.

Nor, of course, can we determine the religious function and ritual which occurred within, or in association with, the shrines. The earliest structures at these sites ante-date the Minoan palace. They also, and no contradictory evidence has yet come to light, represent the first examples of constructed sanctuaries in Crete.28 Did their architecture, however, fundamentally differ from that of the subsequent domestic shrines or chapels associated with the palace? Only the extant pictorial representation can answer this question; and those, which can definitely be associated with peak sanctuaries, are few and occasionally fragmentary. Again, the vessels or seals with figures of peak cult scenes on them belong to the end of Middle Minoan or are as late as L. M. I. But for all that, there is no reason to disbelieve the story they tell which may apply to the entire period when this kind of cult was in vogue. A fragment of an M.M. III/L.M. I rhyton from Knossos2 shows a steep, wooded slope whose peak is crowned by a sanctuary. This consists of a central part, flanked by two lower wings, on a terrace of stone blocks. Horns of conse- cration surmount the structure which, in fact, resembles a typical Minoan tripartite shrine. In front of the left wing of the building is what looks like a long thin pillar or pole, very much like those painted on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, and therefore perhaps also crowned with double axes. This cannot, however, be seen from our fragment. The central figure before the shrine is that of a man depositing a basket with offerings.30 Another M.M. III/L.M. I rhyton, of the same material and showing the same kind of peak sanctuary, was dis- covered in Kato Zakro by Platon.8' In addition to many examples of horns of consecration, this sanctuary is also associated with a sacred tree, Minoan type "portable" altars (with incurving sides'. and a number of wild goats, four of which are sitting on the roof of the central portion of the shrine. Finally, a fragment of a contemporary rhyton from Gipsadhes essentially repeats the same picture of peak cult and cult structure.33 These scenes are fairly explicit regarding this kind of sanctuary. Other re- presentations of the subject are found on seals or their impressions. Therefore 2 Cf. Ch. Picard, Les Religions Prdhelldniques (Crele et Mycenes), Paris 1948, 59. " Kret.

DIETRICH scenes from this source are much smaller in scale, and in some instances, one suspects, they have come to be touched by a good deal of artistic imagination. Altogether there remains only one other pictorial representation which can with reasonable certainty be referred to mountain peak cult. That is the famous L.M. II seal impression from Knossos. On it we see a goddess, with staff or spear in her right hand, standing on the summit of a mountain which, in turn, is flanked by two lions. In front of her, on the level ground, a male worshipper is shown, arms raised in adoration, while behind the goddess a two-storeyed cult building, with horns and pillars, is tucked away into the left corner of the picture." The building, as has been correctly remarked,35 properly belongs on top of the mountain which here has been left uncluttered to allow for the epiphany of the goddess. Other scenes adduced in this connection are of much more dubious value. They are, in fact, little more than useless as evidence, because the ritual scenes cannot be localised in any particular area. A good case in point is a M.M. III/L.M. I fragment of a steatite pyxis from Knossos, depicting two men in a lively cultic performance in front of a sacred enclosure, perhaps surrounding a sacred tree." The altar before the enclosure, in the centre of the picture, though also surmounted by a pair of horns, is isodomic in structure und there- fore quite unlike the "portable" models we noticed on the Kato Zakro rhyton. This difference may well be of minor importance, but the fact remains that there is nothing to connect this scene with peak cult, despite what could be said about certain features of architectural resemblance to the temenos on mountain cult sites.37 Basically the same objections hold true in the case of two other, occasionally cited, pieces of evidence. By far the more plausible of the two scenes occurs on an L.H. III gold ring from Pylos."8 Despite the large presence of what undoubt- edly is a goat, the epiphany of a deity, and the figure of a worshipper in front of some sort of sacred structure, the scene, it seems to me, is far from clear and cannot without reservations be identified with that occurring on a mountain peak.39 This is not to say that we should reject such an identification out of hand, there is indeed much to commend it, but the picture is too vague and involved to be disentangled with confidence.'0 We are, however, on very shaky ground with the last example, a gold ring from Knossos (L.M. I),41 34 B. S. A. 7 (1900/I) 29 fig. 9. 35 Press, op.cit. (see n. 30) 429. 36 Evans, J. H. S. 21 (1901) fig. 2. 37 See Press, op.cit. (see n. 30) 430. 38 C. W.

Press again believes that this picture describes an instance of mountain cult.'2 So it might be, of course, but who can prove it? Closer to hand perhaps is the identification with a type of sanctuary depicted on many Minoan and Mycenaean gems," and referring to a form of rural tree cult." One imagines that there existed many rural shrines in the plains of Crete and Greece in the Bronze Age, al- though all trace of them has now vanished. A survey of what might be called reasonably certain evidence regarding mountain peak sanctuaries, and the cult associated with them, produces no clear unified picture of the nature of such a cult. This does not surprise, how- ever, in a period of Aegean religion whose scanty sources allow very little in the way of knowledge unclouded by conjecture. Nevertheless, the material there is does make some tentative deductions possible concerning certainly the timing of cult observance in these localities and perhaps even about the form of cult. But we must not forget that we are largely treading in the dark, and it is good advice, therefore, to avoid any kind of general pronouncements on the inter- pretation of material. Nor should we indulge in the attractive pastime of re- constructing Minoan peak cult on the strength only of our own ideas which are apt to be rejected with equal ease, or which may be replaced by more colourful or exciting ones. Rather more valuable is a consideration of the peak cult material in the light of what is known of Minoan religious ritual in other localities. We would already take a large step forward if we could with reasona- ble certainty either set aside this kind of cult from domestic and cave cult, or alternately assert, on the strength of the evidence - and this is, I think, pos- sible -, that in all likelihood there was no fundamental divergence in the type of worship obtaining on mountain summits and in other sanctuaries. In other words, can one integrate peak cult with other forms of cult? The connection between cave and domestic cult has been discussed elsewhere, and there no longer remains any doubt that certain vital features of the former continued in domestic shrines from Middle Minoan.'5 The point of contact between domestic and peak sanctuaries, as far as one can see from the sparse monumental remains regarding the latter, really lies in the similarity of the design of the cultic structures. The rhyta scenes discussed above depict peak sanctuaries with the same type of tripartite fa9ade with which we are familiar from e.g. the palace at Knossos, or the villa at Vathypetro.4" Nilsson, too, in 42 Op.cit. (see n. 30) 430. 43 To cite a few, see the examples in Nilsson, op.cit. (see n. 32) I, P1. 13, 1-3 and 5-8. 4" Cf. Nilsson, op.cit.

(see n. 30) 429, who says that "these buildings (on the rhyta) with their tripartite fasades, which are sometimes re-</page><page sequence="8">264 B. C. DIETRICH discussing the sanctuary of Petsophas in eastern Crete, comes to the conclusion that "the character of the building is the same as that of the houses at Pal- aikastro belonging to the late Minoan period".47 It would seem that the divinity, or divinities, worshipped on mountain peaks might well have been equally at home in the domestic chapel. Of course, architectural similarity in cult buildings alone does not prove that. But, taking into account the fact that mountain peak worship was born only at the beginning of M.M., but preceded the building of the palace, we might suppose that the sanctuary of the former set the model for the design of the palace chapel." Consider, too, the case of the sanctuary at Karphi. When the villagers from the plain of Lasithi, perhaps under the stress of political events at the end of the Bronze Age, came to settle on "the Nail", the inhospitable saddle below the mountain peak which formerly had housed their mountain shrine, they would hardly have built their sanctuary on the same site previously occupied by an alien deity or cult. The case for a connection between cave and peak cult in Crete, one would imagine, is proved with even greater facility. The physical proximity of these two kinds of site should point to a similarity of cult or at least deity revered. There are instances, for example, when one mountain possessed both a sacred cave and a peak sanctuary. The best known of these is, of course, Mt. Juktas which, in addition to the temenos on its summit discussed above, has a sacred grotto, Nosto Nero, containing the usual offerings of vase fragments and terracotta animals.49 There are, however, certain features which, at face value, should separate the two cults. Unlike sacred caves, for instance, peak sanctuaries by their very nature could not originally have been used for human habitation. In general, their sacred precincts were more elaborately constructed than the occasional temenos within a cave. Again, the deities revered on these exposed sites need not have been primarily chthonic in character, as were the figures of cave cult. There is, for example, no evidence of burial on mountain tops in the Bronze Age.50 These last points show that cave and peak cult could not have been iden- tical in every respect. But none of the objections appears to rule out a connec- presented on paintings or on gold objects, are usually associated with some palace ... or with a villa, as at Vathypetro.". ,97 Nilsson, op.cit. (see n. 8) 69. 48 An interesting note in this connection comes from Hutchinson, op.cit. (see n. i6) 2I9, who tells us that the peak sanctuary on Mt. Juktas was constructed according to "a plan somewhat resembling that of the more or less contemporary temple of Tell Ai in Palestine." Cf. M. V. Seton-Williams, Iraq, I949, 8i, fig. 4. '9 Taramellig, Monum. ant. 9, 356ff.; A. B. Cook, op.cit. (see n. 3) I, i6o; J. L. Myres, B. S. A. 9 (1903) 379. 50 The tradition which places Zeus' tomb on Mt. Juktas is probably late, and only one of several which variously put it on Mt. Ida or Mt. Dikte. For sources see Cook, op.cit. (see n. 3) I, 158. Evans, Pal. of Min. I, 158, believes the Juktas legend to be ancient, but it may go back no further than the Middle Ages, cf. Nilsson, op.cit. (see n. 8) 46I.</page><page sequence="9">Peak Cults and their Place in Minoan Religion 265 tion between the two, a type of continuity, one might suppose, in the Middle Bronze Age of religious ideas which earlier had found expression in cave sanctuaries from the beginning of the age and, in some cases, from the Neoli- thikum.61 But here, too, we have to be careful, since cave cult did not come to a stop at the end of E.M., but continued occasionally into historical times. A more immediately tangible point of contact is the sacred tree which played a part in both peak anld cave cult. Beside the tree from the Zakro rhyton, for example, we might cite the representation of a sacred tree on the famous bronze votive plaque(L.M. I?) discovered in the Psychro cave,52 and showing in the centre a tree mounted on some sort of base. To the right is the figure of a worshipper, while the rest of the scene is made up of three pairs of horns, each with a bough growing from the centre, a fish, a bird, the sun, moon and stars. The bird is shown as perching on one of the separate boughs within a pair of horns of consecration, and it most likely represents the epiphany of a deity."4 A tree again, as well as individual boughs, one in the centre of a pair of horns, feature on an L.M. II gem from the Idaean cave with, in the left fore- ground, the figure of a goddess(?) blowing into a large shell." The fact that a tree plays an important part in cave and peak sanctuary does not identify the two cults, for, as we already observed above, the tree was ubiquitous in the Minoan religious scene,6 but it brings them closer together and helps to indicate that peak cult shared some basic religious concepts with other cult localities. Of more immediate value to the comparison of cave and peak cult is the point already mentioned above, that is the obvious physical proximity of the two types of locality. In some cases apparently archaeologists cannot be certain whether we are dealing with a true peak sanctuary or with a kind of rock shelter which, one supposes, would have possessed features of cult more closely allied with the cave. Even the site of Petsophas,65 by its nature and situation, 51 This idea of continuity does not, of course, work in every instance, since some Cretan caves saw cult from a comparatively late date. The Psychro cave, for example, was used as a place of worship only from Middle Minoan, see R. F. Willetts, Cretan Culls and Festivals, London I962, 145. 52 Evans, Pal. of Min. I, 632 fig. 470. 53 Cf. Willetts, op.cit. (see n. 51) 146. 54 Evans, J. H.

Persson, The Religion of Greece in Prehistoric Times, Berkeley 1942. References to the provenance of individual gems will be found in the text - pp. 32ff.

DIETRICH at first glance leaves room for doubt whether it was a rock shelter or peak sanctuary.57 The Middle Minoan building there, of course, is evidence that Petso- phas was an example of the latter. Nevertheless, the point needs to be made that, as at Petsophas, to modem eyes the line between peak and cave sanctuary appears to be thinly drawn at times with respect to physical proximity or juxtaposition. An interesting case in this connection can be seen at Christos in southern Crete. The site shows the remains of the usual rectangular build- ing of a peak sanctuary,," but below the floor in the main chamber there runs an enormous fissure in the rock, "which may have been the entrance to a cave" .6 This possible "entrance to the underworld" could mean that chthonic deities had access to peak cult. At any rate the Christos example shows that we should be wrong to claim a fundamental difference between cave and peak cult in ritual and deities revered. 60 Votive offerings found on mountain peak sites can be artificially divided into the three groups, a) those common to other cult sites, and b) those not found elsewhere, and c) those absent, although common in other localities. There is no need here to give exhaustive inventories, these can be found in the respective excavation reports. But confining ourselves to general types of offering, we may say that under a) fall the numerous examples of figurines of animals and humans, male and female, many of the latter in the usual bell- shaped form, that is conical from the waist downward."$ The animal figurines with which we are familiar from other cult sites, including cave sanctuaries, are especially birds and goats, which, of course, also occurred on the rhyta described above with scenes of peak sanctuaries. Finally, the sacred precincts on mountain tops contained examples of the ubiquitous horns of consecration. Again, those offerings and cult paraphernalia which, though common to other cult sites, have not been found in peak sanctuaries, under our category c), include metal objects, double axes and tables of libation.

Metal objects might simply have disap- peared, owing to the exposed nature of the peak sites.0 Speculation of this kind is naturally valueless by itself, but it suggests that we need not give up hope of discovering examples of the more common cult implements, like the double axe, in the course of future excavation. Quite unique to peak sanctuaries, however, are offerings (our category b) of animal figurines which can only be described as field pests or vermin and whose inclusion in cult seems strange. The Petsophas deposit, for example, contained models of tortoises, hedgehogs and weasels." Juktas possessed figures of weasels modelled in clay, while figurines of the rhinoceros beetle were found at Piskokephalo." This feature, together with the many terracotta figures of detached human heads and limbs, and of bodies cloven from crown to fork,66 set peak cult apart from that obtaining in other localities. Let us briefly consider these two aspects and their possible significance. A close definition is obviously impossible, because our evideince does not permit any definite conclusions, so that whatever we may propose in explanation of these ritual features must in essence remain conjectural. To begin with, we should agree with Evans and Platon who rightly said that the buildings on mountain peaks, especially at Juktas and Petsophas, were sanctuaries.67 Sir John Myres had at one time proposed that the house at Petsophas was a private building.'" In the light of the more recent discoveries described above, and particularly in view of the scene on the Kato Zakro rhyton,69 Myres' view is no longer tenable. The curious animals, like weasels, hedgehogs etc. can only have one explanation,and this was already divined by Evans. They belonged to apotropaeic cult, and the small models were a kind of prophylactic offering made to the deity invoked as a protection against the ravages of such pests, and possibly against the diseases they spread amongst men. Evans compares the golden emerods and mice offered by the Philistines, "themselves, in part at least, of Cretan origin".70 62 For example the tall pillar, in the right foreground of the fragment of a steatite rhyton from Knossos, see above p. 26I and n. 29, could, on analogy with other cultic scenes, like that on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, have carried a double axe on its peak. The same applies to scenes on gems which, however, are not so easily identified with mountain peak cult, see above pp. 262 f. 63 Nilsson, op.cil. (see n. 8) 73, suggests that bronze was rarer and more expensive in M. M. than in L. M. 64 See above p. 259. 65 Hutchinson, op.cit. (see n. i6) 219. 66 See above p. 259. 67 Pal. of Min.

Evans' last point, of course, is debatable. Willetts makes the interesting suggestion in a footnote, op.cil. (see n. 5I) 72 n. 82, that this type of offering was also meant to ensure protection against the plagues and diseases carried by mice and rats.</page><page sequence="12">268 B. C. DIETRICH This type of apotropaeic ritual was not confined to the East, but was known well enough to the Mediterranean world and does not require any specific references. One point, however, which is of some importance in con- nection with Minoan peak cult and the deity revered on these sites, is that apo- tropaeic cult and the protection from animal plagues was not only the province of a Mistress of Animals. The many models, therefore, on the summit precincts of stoats, mice and weasels do not inevitably betray the presence of a Potnia Theron, as we come to know her later in the figure of Artemis. Male divinities could be equally responsible for the protection against animal plagues and pestilence. We need only think of Zeus Apomyios in Olympia,n or Apollo Parnopios, the protector against locusts, and Smintheus, the prot- ector against mice. The reason for these titles and the nature of the cult are obvious from the description in Aelian and Clement of Alexandria.72 If then, as seems reasonable, we have in these models of vermin examples of apotropaeic cult in mountain peak sanctuaries, these latter need not have been the home of a Potnia Theron. This would mean that an important part of Nilsson's thesis, according to which peak cults exclusively belonged to a Mistress of Animals, falls away." Nilsson puts forward his idea with some misgivings which appear to be allayed by his interpretation of the other type of problematical offering, the separate limbs etc. These, in his opinion, formed a part of a fire ritual known from the historic cult of the Mistress of Animals. It seems that at Petsophas Sir John Myres discovered traces of a similar rite74 which, like the Greek example, may have consisted in the casting into a large bonfire of idols, animal statuettes and perhaps even slaughtered animals. The fragments of figures, and the remains of the fire, would from time to time be raked over or deposited in the rock fissures.75 The apparent coincidence between later Greek and Minoan practice 71 Pausanias, 5, I4, I; Pliny, N. H. 10, 40. 72 Ael., N. A. II, 5; Clem. Alex., Protrept. II, 34P. This apotropaeic practice inevitably came to be mixed up with genuine animal cult in Greece, cf. Clem. ibid.; Nilsson, op.cit. (see n. 32) 1, 213, in historical times. Also a number of subsequently invented aetiological myths tend to obscure the early history of genuine animal cult. One would, for instance, like to know the age and original reasons for the Theban worship of weasels. By the time Aelian, ibid., tells the story, it is already involved in the Galinthias and Heracles myth. Regarding Apollo's epithet of Smintheus, an interesting remark comes from the Schol. A on Homer, II. I, 39, where he says that a[LLvOoq is the Cretan word for pvq, cf. Frazer's note on Paus. I0, I2, 5. But any connection of Apollo with Crete must still remain doubt- ful. 7 Op.cit. (see n. 8) 75; op.cit. (see n. 32) I, 264. 71 B. S. A. 9 (1903) 358. 75 Myres' own explanation of the human limbs and parts is that these were dedicated to a healing deity who had cured the affected parts, models of which were hung in the sanctuary in her honour. The difficulty of such an interpretation lies in the many other kinds of offerings found on the mountain, in addition to Nilsson's own objections, op.cit. (see n. 8) 74-</page><page sequence="13">Peak Cults and their Place in Minoan Religion 269 is important and makes Nilsson's theory an attractive one, for the Mistress of Animals played a significant part in Cretan and Greek belief, while the peak of a mountain might well have been her natural habitat. But does all the evidence agree with such an interpretation? Should we not rather look for a figure, or figures, of more general import? The fire ritual at Petsophas is too thinly documented. Furthermore, one should not lightly associate the votive human heads, limbs etc. with a Mistress of Animals, simply because some artistic representations show her surrounded by parts of animals. Separate human limbs very occasionally appear in Cretan art on gems and sealings. Like the similar examples in Egyptian and the largely independent Hittite hiero- glyphic scripts,76 such limbs, mostly legs, might conceivably have held some religious connotation beside their purely symbolic meaning. Thus a human leg occurs beside a double axe and a fish on an M.M. clay sealing from the Early Pillar Basement at Knossos.77 Again, a leg is shown beside a cat( ?), and other signs, on a fine three-sided prism seal from M.M. III , 78while another - four- sided prism seal - also from M.M. (Hagia Triada) has a leg, bent at the knee, between objects similar to vases.79 Once, on a sealstone from the necropolis of Phaestus, a human head is engraved between two agrimi lying back to back." The significance of these legs, or heads, is obscure: there is little reason to connect them with a goddess solely concerned with animals. But if, especially in view of the peak offerings, such representations do possess some religious value, they may well refer to a cult in honour of a deity of nature whose functions extended over a wider area. Perhaps, then, one must suppose these severed limbs to be remnants, as it were, of a savage worship performed for a great goddess, a worship which fell into disuse at a relatively early time. We may mention in this context the strange find of human bones scattered at random - unlike any burial - in a pit beneath the niche and bull head on the east wall of the Second Shrine at (atal Hluyiik.81 Whatever the ritual, which involved such strange offerings, it must have been compatible with, and formed a part of those larger cultic features that were not alien to cave and domestic worship. In peak cult we appear to meet with certain features of apotropaeic cult, and with a deity in some way closely related to animals, domestic and wild, in a bond which recalls aspects of a Mistress of Animals. A great deal, therefore, 76 Cf. 0. R. Gurney, The Hittites, Pelican I96I, 126f. 77 V. -. G. Kenna, Cretan Seals, Oxford I960, fig. 44. 78 Kenna, ibid. fig- 74. 79 Kenna, ibid. fig. go.

DIETRICH of what we can say about peak cult hinges on the identity of the divinity concerned with the rites celebrated there. However, a survey of our relevant pictorial evidence produces only one certain example of an anthropomorphic divine figure associated with peak cult. This is the clay impression of an L.M. II gold ring from Knossos82 showing a goddess, staff in hand, on the peak of a mountain which is flanked, heraldic fashion, by two lions. The male figure in front of her, with his arms thrown up in a gesture of adoration, is obviously a worshipper of the goddess who appeared to him. Here we come to the heart of our problem: this mountain peak scene is an epiphany, that is the goddess appears to her worshippers in the same way, we may imagine, as in other cult sanctuaries, in domestic cult and presumably in caves. What we cannot quite so easily tell is whether this goddess functioned alone in the moun- tain sanctuaries, or whether she shared her cult with other figures. One other figure which has suggested itself in this connection is the youthful male paredros who featured in other spheres of Cretan religion. As far as moun- tain peak cults are concerned we are, alas, on less certain ground. There exists only one piece of concrete pictorial evidence which shows a male figure in association with this kind of cult, and that is the L.M. I gold ring from Knossos with the epiphany scene of a young(?) god before a tree sanctuary. But we were forced to admit above that this scene cannot, with certainty, be connected with a mountain peak shrine.83 The rest of the evidence consists of inferences from the Minoan cultic scene at other sites, and from later tradition which strongly connects a male deity with peak sanctuaries. The many features which peak cult shared with other cult localities might well have included the presence of the male figure who played a significanit part in Minoan religion.84 Much more valuable in this connection is the stubborn association of the Zeus Kretagenes figure with the Mt. Juktas sanctuary -the tradition of his tomb there is late86-, an association which survived for many generations.86 The last point in particu- lar might offer some justification for supposing that in the precinct of the mountain peak the well-known figure of the male god, probably the assessor of the nature goddess, had his place, too, although we should hesitate to name him, with Hutchinson, the Master of Animals.87 A male figure, then, in association with a goddess was a possible object of worship in mountain peak cult, although his presence cannot be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Our proposal is not new, however, since Platon, in 82 Above p. 262. 83 Above p. 263. 84 See Dietrich, op.cit. (see n. 45) 40I with references, and Dietrich, "Notes on the Linear B Tablets in the Context of Mycenaean and Greek Religion", Atti e Mem. I0 Congr. I, 124.

(see n. 32) I, 288, seems overdone.</page><page sequence="15">Peak Cults and their Place in Minoan Religion 27I his examination of peak cults made some sixteen years ago, came to the same conclusion.88 Where we differ from Platon is in the description of the goddess, whom he calls the Great Nature Goddess. Neither can we agree with his des- cription of the nature of the cult as a magic ritual concerned with healing.89 Nilsson in part agrees with Platon by seeing in the goddess a Mistress of Animals.90 We already noticed above that the identification with a cult of healing will not easily stand up on the strength of the ex votos of limbs etc. Furthermore, we must be careful with our terminology when describing the goddess as a Potnia Theron, for this is an arbitrary term, devised on analogy with the later function of great classical goddesses like Artemis. It seems more important to recognize in this divinity, worshipped on mountain tops, a figure, or an aspect of a figure, at home both in cave and domestic cult. The goddess, one might say, central to all Minoan cult was concerned with nature, the growth and decay of vegetation, human birth and death, all aspects which can be isolated from cave cult and which continued in some form when this cult was transferrred to domestic shrines.91 As a nature goddess she also was concerned with animals, and to that extent can be called a Mistress of Animals. But if we compare this Cretan goddess with the well known figure of the Eastern Great Goddess and her paredros, and consequently speak of one Mother Goddess presiding over Bronze Age Minoan religion, we are over- simplifying matters, if we are to put any trust in the evidence of the Linear B tablets which know of at least Athena, Hera and Artemis and the gods Poseidon, Zeus, Dionysos and Hermes. And it does not really matter that the written evidence cannot be earlier than the middle of the fifteenth century B.C., for we are dealing with a religous subject which continued a tradition that must at the very least have gone back to Middle Minoan, but in fact camie into being much earlier. Also, the relationship between goddess and animals, which existed in peak cult as well, was more than that of mistress and servant. I have discussed elsewhere, together with recently discovered parallel evidence from older settlements like (atal Hiiyuk in Anatolia, the curiously close relationship between goddess and her animal. The goddess, it seems, could be represented by any one of her animals, in other words she could appear to her worshippers in zoomorphic shape.92 The young male figure survived into Greek religion, in myth, in figures like Zeus Kretagenes or Velchanos or Dionysos.9 His association with his goddess' animals, like the bull, was equally close; and while in the East he could be born in animal shape, as a ram or bull, in Crete and in Greek legend he was nursed by his zoomorphic mother, the goddess of nature, under the name e.g. of Amaltheia. The goat suckling a young boy was " Op.cit. (see n. 4) 96ff. 89 Cf. n. 75 above. "0 Op.cit. (see n. 8) 75. 91 Cf. Dietrich, op.cit. (see n. 45) 400; 402. " Dietrich, op.cit. (see n. 45) 408; op.cit.

DIETRICH a not uncommon subject of Greek art9' and reflects the important part this story played in Minoan belief. The nature goddess and the youthful male figure, often called the "Divine Child"95 were the central part of cave cult. They also had a history, together with their animals, like goat and bull, in the palace shrine to the end of the Bronze Age. In the latter locality the goddess became primarily a protecting deity, and her paredros, one suspects, even in the Mycenaean realm, became identified with the king. This probably happened in the case of Erechtheus.96 In the light of this picture of the Cretan religious scene I advisedly spoke of the sealing from Knossos97 as our only extant representation of an anthro- pomorphic divinity connected with peak cult. For who can now say with certainty to what extent the lions flanking the goddess on the seal, or the birds and goats on the rhyta discussed above, were not meant to express an epiphany of the deity on these cult sites ?98 The important point to recognize, however, is that here in mountain peak cult we are confronted with essentially the same goddess, known at other sites, who was intimately associated with her animals, and who in this cult locality, too, may have been thought of as together with a male companion. Her name we cannot know, but it most likely consisted of an invocatory title, like that of other Cretan divine figures.99 Two such titles, Potnia and Wanassa, are supplied by the Linear B tablets,10? and we may well suppose that the goddess in the mountain shrine was called upon by her wor- shipper under the name of Lady, Mistress or Queen, in the same way as in cave or palace. In fact, the goddess revered on Mt. Juktas and at Petsophas was an aspect of the nature goddess, at home in mountain peaks, and comparable, there- fore, with other aspects receiving cult in other localities. Such departmentalization of divine function was a feature of both Minoan and Mycenaean cult. By Late Minoan this division into separate aspects had considerably progressed, as witness the various names like Artemis, Hera, Athena and possibly Demeter, as well as others, possessing separate spheres and divine functions, but whose original character, as part of the general nature goddess, was still evident at the time.101 It is another matter whether we can, with Guthrie, dogmatically divide these aspects into three distinct types of goddess, namely I) an Earth Mother, 2) a Mountain Mother, and 3) a Snake " See Dietrich, op.cit.

Clear knowledge of this point would not materially affect the religious scene under discussion.</page><page sequence="17">Peak Cults and their Place in Minoan Religion 273 and House Goddess.102 The evidence suggests that the separate figures were more numerous, whether we find them in the Linear tablets, or amongst the deities destined to survive in Greek legend and religion, such as Eileithyia, Diktynna, Aphaea, Ariadne and others.103 The goddess, or one of her aspects, revered in mountain peak sanctuaries was essentially the same as the goddess who stood behind, as it were, the various aspects at the centre of cave and domestic cult. In this department- alization obviously some special features of divine functions developed in particular cult localities. In caves, as at Amnisos, the most likely features to predominate in ritual were those concerned with birth and death and the annually recurring cycle of vegetation.104. The goddess, or her particular aspect, in the palace shrine would be called upon for her protecting qualities: she was a guardian of the palace which was her domain, and she stood in a particularly close relationship with the king.'06 Peak cult, too, enjoyed special features peculiar to itself, such as apotropaeic ritual and a religious concept whose true significance now escapes us. Perhaps, as was noticed above, we are dealing here with a remnant of a primitive and cruel domination of the goddess over her subjects, a feature which may have survived, but which, in historical times, sank into obscurity. In sum, however, we may say that, the separate features peculiar to indivi- dual cult sites apart, all cult localities in Crete were integrated in one homogenous religious scene governed in main by various divine concepts which, when all is said and done, could all be gathered in the sphere of one goddess of nature associated with her animals and with her youthful male companion. Therefore it is not surprising when we come across evidence, as in the Little Palace at Knossos, of a transference of a cult from, for example, cave to domestic shrine.106 Cave cult nevertheless continued side by side with domestic cult throughout M.M. and L.M. Some cave cults, indeed, as at Psychro, were instituted not before M.M..107 Cave and peak sanctuaries, apart from their physical proximity, shared some basic features of cult, although they must have differed in others.'08 But there is absolutely no evidence that the gap between religious concepts in either site was wide. The same is true of peak and domestic palace sanctuaries. The sacred buildings on mountain tops had the same character as the palace shrines,'09 but were constructed earlier than the latter. 102 W.

DIETRICH Therefore, remembering that, with some exceptions, peak cult seemed to come to an end at the beginning of Late Minoan, we might be justified in assuming that the palace shrine tended to take over and continue peak cult which in consequence fell into disuse. This suggestions could, however, only partly answer our problem, because we should then have to maintain that those features of peak cult, outlined above, which find no parallel in domestic cult were simply forgotten. The problem of timing, too, is difficult and has to be faced quite frankly. While we may quarrel with Platon's deduction that peak sanctuaries flourished in M.M. I, but were abandoned until Late Minoan,110 and believe with Hutchinson that "it is likely that several of these sanctuaries continued to be frequented throughout much of the M.M. period",111 the fact remains that, by the end of M.M., archaeological evidence points to a sharp decline in the use of peak sanctuaries. Transference of cult features to another locality, as we noticed in the case of cave cult, need spell the extinction of the original site. We can- not lightly assume that, because the architecture and design of the peak sanctuaries appealed to the builders of the palace shrine, and because in essence the same divine figure was worshipped in the latter, peak cult was taken over and absorbed by the new palace shrine without leaving a trace in the former site. In the present state of our knowledge, it is not worth while to look for political or physical reasons for the decline, for none of them can be proved and few are very convincing. Rutkowski, for example,112 blames the natural disasters at the end of M.M. and later in about I500 B.C."3 for the abandon- ment of these exposed cult sites and for renewed activity in the building of underground 'cryptas' and cave sanctuaries."' This information is not particu- larly helpful, however, because we do not know the extent of total damage during these destructions, nor can we do more than guess if a relationship did indeed exist between these disasters and the institution of fresh cave cults in Middle Minoan. Not all cult centres need have been affected. The perhaps natu- ral catastrophes of c. I700 B.C.x"6 may not have put out of commission the Mallia palace, for example,'16 which probably continued to flourish well into the fifteenth centurv. The same most likely applied to the "Herrenhauser" at e.g. Tylissos, Gurnia and Palaikastro."17 In any case, at least some parts of the island which, like Knossos, suffered from the different earthquakes, eruptions and fires quickly recovered, late in M.M. and in L.M.

The true state of affairs probably was much less dramatic. At a time when palace culture had reached its brightest lustre, in early Late Minoan, some parts of peak cult probably were moved to the new abode. Individual features of peak cult, however, undoubtedly survived, albeit in greatly diminished form. The archaeological picture in support of this belief is admittedly vague for obvious reasons. But some archaeological evidence of continued cult in sites like Kumasa, as late as L.M. IIIB, remains."1 Further strong arguments in favour of the enduring sacredness of peak sites is the long association of Zeus with these high places which eventually were converted to Christianity,'" and the utilization for religious purposes of an old mountain top site at Karphi by the refugees settling there to escape the cataclysmic events of the ending Bronze Age. These ultra-conservative people, who in their inaccessible stronghold preserved into Protogeometric times their Bronze Age religion, felt at home in an area which, already in Middle Minoan, had been consecrated to one aspect of this goddess.'21.
