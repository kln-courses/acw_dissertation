<plain_text><page sequence="1">WINGS FOR My FLIGHT. By Marcy Cottrell Houle. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Inc., New York, New York. 1991: 187 pp., $17.95.-Marcy Cottrell Houle's narrative account of observing a nesting pair of Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus anatum) at Chimney Rock, Colorado in 1975 not only gives us insight into the behavior of these magnificant birds of prey but also portrays a realistic and not always so pleasant or romantic view of a field biologist's working conditions. Just out of college and working for the state of Colorado, Ms. Houle and her partner, Ms. Alex Porter of the U.S. Forest Service, were caught in the conflict between those who wanted to develop this ancient Anasazi Indian site for tourism and the few who felt the falcons should be left relatively undisturbed during the nesting season. The fact that they were young and women in a traditionally male role added to the difficulties in dealing with some members of the community. Aside from the excessive anthropomorphic interpretations of the falcon's behavior, we get an in depth description of the peregrine's activities in different stages of development from the time of incubation until the two young could hunt for themselves, approximately four months. The blend of biology and ecology, with a touch of history of the Anasazi Indian site where the falcons chose to nest, make for enjoyable and easy reading. Ms. Houle's perseverance and dedication to the protection of the Peregrine Falcon is admirable and an incentive not only to young biologists just getting started but to those of us who get a little more than discouraged with the struggle to protect endangered species and their habitats. Wings for my Flight should be suggested reading for science students from age 16 on.-DoNNA MrrCHELL.</page></plain_text>
