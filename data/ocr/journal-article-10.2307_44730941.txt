ABSTRACT A MADYMO simulation model was created to analyze the kinematics of a bicycle rider during a frontal collision with a rigid object. The model was validated using a series of crash tests in which rider trajectory was captured with high-speed photography. The test bicycles were equipped with either traditional fixed or suspension front forks. Impact speeds varied from 22.5 to 31.0 kph to cover a range of fork response from minor bending to significant bending and fracture. The predictions of simple particle trajectory analysis were found to approximate rider motion. Rider motion was relatively unaffected by hand and foot "connections" to the bicycle. Furthermore, the rider connection to the bicycle was insufficient to create any significant rider deceleration as a result of bicycle fork deformation. INTRODUCTION While bicycle riding is a very popular recreational activity and form of transportation, it is also associated with over half a million injuries each year (Ayres, et al., 1998). Understanding cycling-related injury causation as well as reducing the frequency and severity of these injuries is therefore of interest to a variety of government and manufacturer organizations. Accidents involving bicycles can involve a wide variety of circumstances. Component failure, interaction with other vehicles, road hazards and fixed objects along with simple loss of stability/control can all lead to potentially injurious accidents. Reconstruction of bicycle accidents is often performed in order to understand the interaction of the cyclist, bicycle and terrain in creating the accident conditions and to understand the mechanism by which the cyclist was injured. In this paper, the authors address cyclist and bicycle interaction in collision events. Contrary to what is commonly presented in the literature (Green et al., 1995), analysis of bicycle collisions involves more than a simplistic application of engineering principles. Unlike a passenger car, a bicycle is a rider-active vehicle in which the operator can control the behavior of the vehicle through changes in body position - in much the same way a motorcycle operator can. However, unlike a motorcycle, the operator of a bicycle weighs significantly more than his vehicle. Another feature of rider-active vehicles is that the operator is not "coupled" to the vehicle. In a passenger car, the occupants can be coupled to the vehicle via seat belts. This coupling benefits the occupant in a collision by decelerating the occupant through energy absorption provided by vehicle deformation as well as stretching of the belt. In a rider- active vehicle, the operator separates from the vehicle in a collision and receives no deceleration benefit from the vehicle. Many bicycle collision analysts incorrectly couple the masses of the bicycle and cyclist when analyzing loads on the bicycle or treat them as rigidly coupled during the collision in order to study rider kinematics. To identify correct procedures for use in analyzing bicycle collisions, the characteristics and kinematics of rider separation were studied using a series of crash tests. In these tests, a cyclist rode into a low, rigid barrier at various speeds. These tests were conducted on level ground and the cyclist was projected onto pads. In order to create an ability to extend these results onto other terrain types and analyze rider trajectory through ground contact, a computer simulation was developed and validated with the experimental results. Beyond the utility of this information from a crash analysis perspective, it is also useful for designers in identifying performance envelopes for bicycles. Performance requirements differ depending on fork style. While some bending resulting from an impact may be tolerable for a fixed fork, a suspended fork must be stiffer since even a small amount of bending can cause the tubes to bind and render the fork inoperable. For designers, the question of impact resistance is how much is necessary and how much is over-design. Figure 1 Illustrates the basic components making up the modern telescoping suspension fork used for mountain bicycles. The typical suspension fork design used on mountain bicycles today is similar in scheme to a motorcycle fork suspension unit. The fork is constructed 869</page><page sequence="2">of two telescoping assemblies, whose sliding action allows motion of the suspension components in response to terrain or rider inputs. The upper portion of the telescoping assembly attaches the suspension fork to the bicycle frame, and the lower portion carries the front wheel and brake system. The telescoping type fork is the first design utilized in the early years (circa 1990) of production by RockShox. Today this type is the most predominant in the bicycle industry. RockShox and most of its competitors use it. Figure 1. Front Suspension Fork Diagram. There are a variety of load inputs affecting the fork on a mountain bicycle. The typical conditions for use include offroad trails, steep descents and irregular terrain. The primary reason for use of a suspension fork on a mountain bicycle, versus a traditional non-suspension fork, deals with control and comfort for the rider. Reduced fatigue, improved steering response and increased continuity of the tire contact with the ground result from a well-designed bicycle suspension fork. The components of load vectors affecting this type of bicycle fork can be easily resolved into the vertical and horizontal elements for analysis. For the purpose of this discussion, vertical is defined as a direction parallel to the suspension fork's telescoping action. Vertically orientated load components are primarily an artifact of rider inputs to the bicycle, terrain inputs, and the reaction loads from internal suspension components generated by suspension fork movements. This particular load orientation creates compression loads on the fork assembly, causing suspension movement. At a point when the vertical loads are released, the fork responds by extending and attempting to reach an equilibrium point between static loads and internal spring pressures. Horizontal load components are similarly generated by terrain and rider inputs, but with different results. The front-to-back bending created by horizontal load components creates fatigue loads that generate maximum stresses at the attachment points to the bicycle frame. This front-to-back bending is also the condition that generates ultimate fork failure during a frontal impact situation, similar to the barrier impact testing done in this study. The bending loads create a moment around the fork attachment point, via the steerer tube, to the bicycle frame. The moment arm is a function of the length of the suspension fork, which decreases as suspension stroke is increased. It is clear that forks must be designed to withstand the loads of normal usage. Usage and configuration dictate different requirements for fixed and suspension forks. It is reasonable for designers to expect more severe riding conditions for suspension forks and therefore higher loads on the fork. In addition, a suspension fork is required to be longer than a fixed fork to allow for suspension travel. A given horizontal load therefore imparts a greater bending moment on a suspension fork. Given these differing constraints, a suspension fork must be stronger than a fixed fork. As a part of cycling, it is reasonable to expect impacts to the front of the bike (i.e. crashes) to occur. It is important for designers to understand where the transition occurs from a "minor" impact to a "major" impact. A minor impact would be one that does not dislodge the rider from the bicycle. A major impact imparts sufficient force to the bike that the rider cannot hold on and is thrown off of the bike. Most bicycle designers know from personal experience that a frontal impact which stops the bike from a speed as low as 8 kph is sufficient to throw most if not all riders off of their bikes. While a small amount of bike damage may be tolerable in an impact that does not throw a rider from the bicycle, it is undesirable to allow so much damage that the bike becomes inoperable thereby potentially leading to a loss of control or more serious crash. In a major frontal impact, since the rider is thrown from the bike anyway, the only logic supporting a design that minimizes damage is customer satisfaction regarding the cost of repair. Another aspect of these design considerations is the relative strength of the components. The stronger the fork, the more deformation is transferred into the frame during impact. Following a major impact, it is not uncommon to find a substantially bent fixed fork or fractured suspended fork, a bent or broken fork steerer tube, and/or bent frame top and down tubes. BICYCLE TESTING A host of test procedures exist for bicycles from a number of organizations. ISO, CPSC, British Standards 870</page><page sequence="3">Institution (BSI), JBMS (Japanese) and Norme Française have promulgated extensive safety requirements specifying test procedures for most bicycle components. In each of the organizations' requirements (except CPSC) a dynamic test is specified for the fork. The procedures are similar and consist of attaching the bike at its rear dropouts and rotating it upward such that the front and rear dropouts are aligned along a vertical axis. A mass is then dropped on a small roller affixed in the front dropouts. The mass is 22.5 kg (26.5 for the JBMS procedure) and is dropped from 180 cm (212 cm for the Norme Française procedure) above the fork. Depending on the mass/drop height combination, 40-47 Nm is imparted to the fork. At least two of the above test procedures specify a pass/fail fork deformation criterion. The CPSC's quasi-static test requires that the total (elastic and plastic) deformation be less than or equal to 64 mm with no visible fracture. The BSI's dynamic impact test requires that the residual (plastic) deformation be less than or equal to 40 mm with no visible fracture. The authors believed that the most effective means to study the characteristics of cyclist ejection was to conduct full-scale crash tests with a bicycle. The most straightforward means to accomplish this was to have a human operator ride into a rigid barrier. Consideration was given to the concern that a human would be somewhat susceptible to "trajectory modification" due to anticipation of the impact. The difficulty associated with using an anthropomorphic test device (ATD or "test dummy") with respect to both test conduct as well as appropriate biofidelity in this application were felt to far outweigh the possibility for "contamination" by using a human test subject. To minimize the effects of rider anticipation, a professional Stuntman was employed as the rider. Given his familiarity with being subjected to crash circumstances, he was well able to suppress his reflexive reactions. He clearly needed to conduct some modification of his body posture during flight in order to minimize injury during landing, but his abilities as a stunt person allowed him to minimize his trajectory modification until well after he had separated from the bicycle following impact of the bicycle with the barrier. A number of tests were conducted with several bike configurations at impact speeds ranging from 22.5 to 31.0 kph. The bikes used had conventional frame geometries and were configured with either fixed or suspended front forks. Three tests were selected for presentation here since they cover the spectrum of performance. These include one test with a fixed fork and two with suspended forks. The suspended fork tests were selected because the bikes were identical and the impact speeds were similar, but the fork fractured in one test. These three tests thus allowed study of rider ejection kinematics under three extremes of bike response: significant fork deflection (fixed fork); minor fork deflection (unbroken suspended fork); and fork separation (fractured fork). Specifications for the tests are presented in Table 1 below. The same bike was used for Tests 2 and 3, but the fork was changed. Each test was recorded with high-speed film and real-time as well as high-speed video. Impact speed was measured by a tape switch speed trap spanning a 30.5-cm distance immediately before impact. A flash bulb triggered by a tape switch on the barrier face was fired when the front wheel contacted the barrier. Table 1: Test specifications. Bike Rider Impact Mass Mass Speed Test Fork Style (kg) (kg) (kph) 1 Fixed 15.6 80 24.5 2 Suspension 14 88 22.5 _3 Suspension 14 88 26.9 As a result of a frontal impact, the front wheel of a bicycle will be displaced rearward. Earlier testing demonstrated that, at speeds above about 16 kph, the wheel/tire would contact the down tube and arrest fork deflection. Evidence from field investigations of crashed bikes indicated that it was common for the wheel to be deflected past the down tube. The geometry of the down tube and tire suggested that even slight turning of the handlebars at impact would allow the tire/wheel to slide past the down tube. It was determined to be too difficult and non-repeatable to have the test rider turn the handlebars at the moment of impact. To direct the wheel past the down tube, a small, angled plate was therefore affixed to the down tube. The plate was greased to reduce friction with the tire. The plate successfully allowed deflection of the wheel past the down tube with minimal restriction. The plate configuration is depicted in Figure 8. TEST RESULTS DISCUSSION It was clear in each of the tests that the velocity of the rider was not measurably affected by the impact regardless of the failure mode of the bike. To illustrate this, three video frames were selected before and after impact; the spacing between frames is approximately 33 ms. Samples of several of these frames from Test 2 are depicted in Figures 2-5 below. These frames as well as the frame for to were overlaid in Adobe Photoshop. For each frame, a highlighting mark was added to mark the position of the target on the rider's helmet. Since the video frame rate was constant, any change in rider velocity would be manifested as a change in the spacing between helmet target locations from frame to frame. As can be seen in the composite of the frames depicted in Figure 6, the spacing between the target positions is unchanged through impact. A similar result was noted in all of the tests, but only this sample is illustrated here in the interest of brevity. 871</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2: Two frames prior to impact •ÍWK ; * Pit "'l Figure 3: Impact Figure 4ļ Two frames after impact Figure 5: Four frames after impact Figure 6: Composite impact sequence with head target location highlights. As a result of the impact, the fixed fork in Test 1 sustained approximately 22.9 cm of permanent deformation (measured as wheelbase shortening). At this deformation, the wheel was permanently deflected past the down tube and the bike was unridable. During impact, the fork was deflected dynamically such that the wheel contacted the bottom bracket, stopping the fork deflection. The suspended fork in Test 2 sustained approximately 9.5 cm of permanent deformation but was still ridable. The fork deformation in these two bikes is depicted in Figures 7 and 8. In Test 3 the fork upper tubes fractured at their attachment to the crown. 872</page><page sequence="5">Rider ejection kinematics were similarly unaffected by the impact performance of the bike. In each of the "extremes" of fork performance (very rigid fork with minimal deflection, highly deformable fork, and fractured fork), only subtle variations in post bike- separation kinematics were noted, and these variances were the result of slight differences in initial rider posture. Video frames depicting rider position following impact for each of the tests are contained in Figures 9- 20. Figure 7: Fixed fork deformation. Figure 8: Suspended fork deformation.

Colored dots were placed over the rider's hip and head target location for seven successive video frames after impact. This was felt to be a sufficient period for trajectory study since the rider's hips were well past the handlebars. It was felt that extending the study period much further would also raise questions about the test rider's volitional movements in preparation for landing on the pads. The selected frames were superimposed to generate the trajectory history depicted in Figure 21 . In Figure 21 , the lower dot sets track the hip target motion while the upper sets track the head. The dots tracking the targets in Test 1 are higher than those for Tests 2 and 3 because the camera location was different and thus the images were in slightly different locations within the video frames. This was somewhat corrected using the ground and barrier targets as location references, 874</page><page sequence="7">but distortion introduced by camera height and lateral location differences could not be corrected. Despite the differences in trajectory location in the video frames introduced by camera location, comparisons could be made to understand the effects of fork performance on rider motion. Comparing the hip and head motion in Tests 2 and 3, it is evident that fork fracture did not cause any change in the motion of the rider following impact. In Test 1, the head followed a path similar to the head in both Test 2 and 3; however, the hip path was slightly different. In Tests 2 and 3, very little pitching was imparted to the rider and therefore the hip trajectory was relatively flat. In Test 1, however, the rider began to stand on the pedals as the bike impacted the barrier. This motion placed the rider's hips somewhat higher at impact and enhanced the pitching of his body following impact. Figure 21 . Rider hip and head trajectories during crash tests. It became clear through analysis of these tests that there was no appreciable coupling between the rider and bike in a frontal impact. The energy absorbed in fork deformation and fracture was that amount necessary to stop the bike. This is an important result for justifying the testing specified by the various organizations outlined above. The specified energy imparted to the fork in these tests varied between 40 and 47 Nm, depending on the test. Assuming a bike mass of 14 kg, this energy equates to an impact speed of approximately 8.6 to 9.3 kph. Cyclists quickly learn that impacts at speeds as low as this will throw them forward over the handlebars. This was demonstrated experimentally with a barrier impact at 12.5 kph. As expected, the bike pitched forward and the test rider was thrown over the handlebars. The significance of this with respect to the various standard test specifications is that they are consistent with sound design practice and provide the bicycle designer with meaningful feedback on bike performance. The standard tests target an impact in the range of the transition from minor to major severity. SIMULATION DEVELOPMENT A mathematical model (MADYMO 5.4, TNO) was created to analyze the kinematics of a bicycle rider during a frontal collision with a rigid object. The model was validated using the crash tests described above. The 22.5 kph and 26.9 kph crash tests with the suspension fork bicycle were modeled. The bicycle model included 7 degrees of freedom: rotation of both wheels, rotation of the crank and the two pedals, and a 2-degree of freedom front fork. The fork was modeled with a rotational degree of freedom at the crown to simulate fork deflection as well as a translational degree of freedom for the suspension. The geometric and inertial properties of the bicycle and its components were measured from the bicycle used in the crash tests. These were included in the model along with friction and stiffness values estimated from measurements of the test bicycle. Since the tests involved the bicycle striking a perpendicular barrier, the model included a fixed handlebar steering angle. 875</page><page sequence="8">The hand-to-handlebar interactions were modeled as point-restraints, and the feet were constrained to have both their positions and orientations coincident with the pedals prior to release. In the simulations, the hands and feet were released at predetermined times. This was done, in part, to allow for the voluntary actions of the rider. Parametric analyses were conducted to assess the effects of hand and feet release times. Hand release times of impact plus 0, 150, and 300 ms, and foot release times of impact plus 0, 125 and 250 ms were examined. The force-deflection properties of the suspension fork were determined from quasi-static force deflection measurements conducted by Rock Shox. The force- deflection functions for the tire-to-ground and tire-to- barrier contact interactions were determined from quasi- static tests of the tire and wheel on the test bicycle. The bicycle rider was modeled with a Hybrid III fiftieth percentile male ATD with a pedestrian pelvis (MADYMO 5.4, TNO). The weight was slightly modified to match that of the test subject. To assess the effect of fork fracture on the rider kinematics, the 26.9 kph crash test was modeled with the actual fork properties, which resulted in fork fracture, and also with a 20% increase in the fork stiffness to prevent fracture. SIMULATION VALIDATION The rider kinematics, as well as the hip and head trajectories of the mathematical model for 26.9 kph (Figure 22) were compared to the kinematics determined from frame-by-frame video analysis of the corresponding crash test. The hip and head trajectories predicted by the model were found to closely follow the trajectories of the crash test subject (Figure 23). The model trajectories were only found to begin to diverge from the experimental trajectories near the end of flight where the head motion was subject to voluntary actions by the test rider. Parametric analysis of the effect of hand release time on rider kinematics showed that only in the trivial case, when the hands release at time zero, is the rider's trajectory significantly different (Figure 24). In this case, the head trajectory is "flatter" as the rider's upper body merely translates forward at the impact velocity. The parametric analysis of effect of foot release showed, as with the hand analysis, a noticeable effect only in the case when the feet release at time zero (Figure 25). In this case, the hip trajectory is "flatter" as the rider translates forward and falls due to gravity. When the feet release at a non-zero time the hips tend to "vault" slightly up and over the handlebars. This response was similar to that noted in the test rider. As documented in the crash tests, the effect of fork fracture on rider kinematics is negligible (Figure 26). The head trajectory is unaffected until late post- separation. With fork fracture, the hips follow a slightly higher trajectory with slightly less rotation of the rider late in the simulation. Furthermore, variations in the kinematics documented between the model and the crash tests occur late in the rider's flight where voluntary actions may occur. In summary, the mathematical model has been validated to demonstrate similar behavior to the experimental crash tests. Variations in foot and hand release times have demonstrated that rider motion was relatively unaffected. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that, during a frontal collision with a rigid object, bicycle rider kinematics are relatively unaffected by the deformation of the bicycle forks, hand or foot "connections" to the bicycle, and the type of bicycle damage (i.e. deformation or fracture). Crash tests illustrated that the impact energy absorbed in damaging bike components (i.e. forks, frame, etc.) was a function only of stopping/slowing the bicycle and that the rider velocity was unaffected by absorption of the impact energy. It was further evident in the testing that rider trajectory was unaffected by the level of fork damage. Minor fork bending, significant bending, or fork fracture all resulted in similar rider motion during his ejection over the handlebars. A MADYMO simulation model was created to analyze the kinematics of a bicycle rider. This model was then validated using the crash test results. The developed validated mathematical model may be used in future studies to investigate various injury mechanisms arising in bicycle collisions.
