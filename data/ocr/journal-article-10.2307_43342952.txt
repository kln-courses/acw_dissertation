This interpretation is supported by occurrences of prunginn in other Eddie passages, by plant images in the OE Metrical Charms, and by reference to the general folklore phenomenon of association between human life and dying or waning natural objects. The simile, deriving from an old, perhaps common Germanic, tradition of cursing with the thistle, is found to be especially apt in Skírnismál , where the curse systematically creates a negative transformation of the hoped-for world of the maiden Gerdr. Finally, elements of the Skírnismál curse are analysed according to their "paradigmatic structure," and a speculation is offered on the relation of the magical simile to this structure. The wooing of Freyr, through his emissary Skirnir, is accomplished by means of a long and powerful curse. As the main part of the curse ap- proaches its climax, just before Skirnir supplies the magically powerful mythic history of his "taming wand" and begins the litany of gods who will hate Gerör (sts. 32-33), the curser reaches a crescendo in galdralag (st. 31): Me5 J)ursi {íríhçfôoôom J)ú scalt ae nara, eöa verlaus vera; ķitt geö grípi, J)ic morn morni!1 It is with surprise, then, that we find in the remainder of this stanza a homely comparison of the girl to a thistle: ver J)ú sem jistili, sá er var prunginn í çnn ofanveröa; 1 Cited from Edda: die Lieder des Codex Regius nebst verwandten Denkmälern , ed. G. Neckel, I. Text, 4th rev. ed. by Hans Kuhn (Heidelberg, 1962). The "curse proper" (which term I will use to mean only the direct magical injunctions in imperative or optative mood) falls into three parts linked by descriptive comments of magical significance: 26, 1-3 de- scriptive introduction; 26, 4-29, 3 curse; 29, 4-7 descriptive link; 30-31 curse; 32-34 de- scriptive link and call upon witnesses; 35 curse; 36 descriptive conclusion. The first two parts of the curse proper are closely linked, and st. 35 seems oddly placed in the midst of Skirnir's peroration (cf. Konstantin Reichardt, "Die Liebesbeschwörung in F&lt;pr Skirnis," JEGP 38 [1939], 487, 492-93 and Lee M. Hollander, " Skírnismál 29 4 . . .," AATF82 (1969), 243-44.</page><page sequence="2">Cursing with the Thistle 27 and these lines have never received a fully satisfactory explication. In defiance of normal growing seasons, Detter-Heinzel imagine the girl compared to a solitary thistle that "springs up" ( ^ryngva ) in the mown field at the end of harvest.1 Though they cite Eddie parallels for the trope of the lonely plant (esp. Háv. 50 and Hm . 5), the interpretation that became standard is that of Magnus Olsen who referred to an Estonian harvest custom which is described by Mannhardt as follows; "Man legt auf jedes Fensterloch eine grosse Distel und auf diese einen Stein. Dann kann der Kobold [i.e., the thistle daemon] während des Dreschens das Korn nicht fortschleppen." 2 Olsen identified these weighted thistles with the ßrunginn thistle of the poem and found it fitting that in a celebration of a fertility rite Gerõr should be threatened with association with the thistle spirit, an enemy of grain. He supported this interpretation with reference to a runic inscription from the stave church at Borgund that seemed to mention "the pressed thistle." However, the harvest custom is attested from Estonia and from modern times, and the animistic basis of Mannhardt's explana- tion of the custom now seems questionable.3 Moreover, Skírnismál specifies the moment as í onn ofanverda "at the end of harvest" 4 while the Estonian custom is practiced "sobald das erste Korn der neuen Ernte zum Dörren aufgestellt wird," thus nearer the beginning. (Nor does var of the poem suggest a custom but a single event.)5 Nevertheless, Olsen's explanation was widely accepted.6 1 F. Detter and R. Heinzel, edd., Sœmundar Edda (Leipzig, 1903), II, 204. 2 Magnus Olsen, "Fra gammelnorsk myte og kultus, "MAř, 1909, pp. 22-23; Wilhelm Mannhardt, Wald- und Feldkulte , I (Berlin, 1875), 69. 3 Nevertheless, some of the customs Mannhardt cites in connection with the thistle (and of course other plants) are undoubtably animistic (e.g., p. 15); cf. Handwörterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens ( = HDA ), col. 301 (thistle as Seelenpflanze ). A similar objection made by Jöran Sahlgren ( Eddica et scaldica , I [Lund, 1927], 253-54) fallaciously relies on the assumption that the thistle can have only one role in folk belief; cf. references to HDA here and below. 4 Hugo Gering, Vollständiges Wörterbuch zu den Liedern der Edda (Halle, 1903) interprets onn as a hapax legomenon meaning "Vorhaus (?)"; in Kommentar zu den Liedern der Edda , I (Halle, 1927), 231 he rejects this in favor of Olsen's (and Detter-Heinzel's) "at the end of harvest," even though a sense connected with "house" sorts equally well with the Eston- ian harvest custom and is at least possible philologically. 5 This objection is also raised by Sahlgren, p. 254. 6 Olsen's reading of the poem as a whole as a reflection of a ritual marriage connected with the fertility cult, deriving support from his treatment of the thistle passage, became "standard" in the sense that subsequent scholars had to take a position on it; the con-</page><page sequence="3">28 JOSEPH HARRIS Jöran Sahlgren, however, offered a series of objections and a diffierent explanation of the prunginn thistle. Citing support for Pryngva in the senses "sammanträngd" and "nach hinten gedrängt," he constructs a plausible image of accidentally harvested thistles being plucked from among the grain as the threshing begins and cast aside; he translates: 4 4 Var du lik tistein, som trängdes hop (dvs. kastades bort i en hög) vid skördeandens slut" and further explains: "Med andra ord: Mâtte du bii lika torr och föraktad, som tistein, som slängdes bort vid trösken" (p. 255). In the meantime Olsen revised his interpretation of the runic inscription which now reads: tis till , mistill , ok inn ßriöi pistill 1 'tis till (?), mistletoe, and thistle the third," undercutting his explanation of the lines in Skírnismál.1 The most recent commentator on the passage, Ursula Dronke, elects for an interpretation slightly simpler than Sahlgren's and like his independent of the Estonian custom: "She is regarded as a menace to human prosperity, like a thistle in the corn: may she be crushed in the threshing like the destructive weed she is" (p. 256). The passage can be further illuminated and Dronke's sensible inter- pretation somewhat modified by comparison to Old English Metrical Charm 9 "For Theft of Cattle."2 After a prose introduction, the verse temporary consensus agrees with his overall argument, while taking cognizance of the criticisms of details raised by Sahlgren (pp. 211-303): Finnur Jónsson, Den oldnorske og old- islandske litteraturs historie , 2nd ed.

Storms' (Anglo-Saxon Magic [The Hague, 1948], pp. 208-10) arrangement of the introduction as verse brings out the balanced syntactical structures and alliteration. Cf.

Erzgräber (Heidelberg, 196 lì, pp. 39-40.</page><page sequence="4">Cursing with the Thistle 29 begins with an appeal to the mysterious Garmund , godes õegen to bring home the stolen cattel (11. 6-9), 1 goes on to proscribe any harbor to the stolen cattle (11. 10-12) and, more generally, all success in the theft (1. 13). 2 The climax of the charm is a direct curse on anyone plotting theft of cattle: Eall he weornige, swa syre wudu weornie, swa breöel seo swa ļ)ystel, se öe öis feoh oöfergean ļ)ence oööe öis orf oöehtian öence (11. 16-19) .3 Here we have a context similar to the problematic lines in Skírnismál: a curse in which the cursed person is likened to a thistle. The simile in both acts with the familiar force of magical sympathy to associate the victim with a natural object that is waning or dying (e.g., the waning moon) or with an artificial pattern of diminution (e.g., Storms No.3). Fully comparable are the magical similes in OE Metrical Charm 12: "Clinge J)u alswa col on heorķe, / scring ļ)u alswa scerne awage, / and weorne alswa weter on ambre," etc. The idea expressed in 1. 16, then, is clear: "May he quite waste away just as dry wood wastes away," 4 and 1 The most elaborate and recent explanation is that of Schneider, pp. 41^43, in which Garmund is Freyr or Baldr. Schneider's reasoning is too circuitous to be convincing, and he has not really come to terms with the suggestion that godes õegen must indicate a Christian priest (F. P. Magoun, "Zu den ae. Zaubersprüchen," Archiv 171 [1937], 26); on the other hand, a supernatural creature of a low order seems to fit the context best. 2 Lines 14-15 are mysterious: "Binnan J)rym nihtum cunne ic his mihta, / his maegen and his mihta and his mundcraeftas." Storms translates "Within three days I shall know his might, / his force and his protecting powers," dropping the second mihta from his text (an emendation adopted by Schneider, p. 43). However, he explains only that "If, in spite of everything, the thief succeeds in carrying them off, he will not escape discovery and punishment: within three days everything about him will be known" (p. 216). Magoun improved on this by interpreting cunne (1. 14) as "nicht 'ich werde wissen,' sondern 'möge ich wissen.'" I would suggest that 1. 14 originally read "Binnan J)rym nihtum cunne ic his naman This supplies the missing alliteration (alliteration of the last stressed syllable is found frequently in the charms, cf. 1. 10), does away with the awkward repetition of mihta , and is explainable as scribal or oral anticipation of the second mihta , perhaps occa- sioned by the rhyme nihtum : mihta. Thus the restored passage would contain all the magic- ally crucial attributes of a man: his innate power ( mœgen and mihta), his relation to external powers {mundcraftas) , and his name. 3 MS reads syer for syre and peo for seo ; see Dobbie for these emendations. 4 Cf.: "Ic eom hege gelic öam Öe hrade weornaj), öonne hit byö amowen" (Bosworth- Toller, s.v. weornian). Bosworth-Toller's citations of weornian are mostly of plants and, by extension, of people.</page><page sequence="5">30 JOSEPH HARRIS folklore in general frequently couples the withering of a person with that of a plant, usually a tree.1 The thistle in our passage, however, is not withering but breõel "fra- gile," 2 an epithet that does not sort well with the impressions of most who have encountered the hardy thistle. However, juxtaposition of the thistle with the "sere wood" of 1. 16 and comparison to Skírnismál suggest that the thistle imagined here is "fragile" because already dry, ready to burst late in the autumn. And conversely, comparison of the breõel English thistle with the prunginn Norse one suggests that the explanations of the latter by Dronke and Sahlgren ("crushed in the threshing"; "kastades bort i en hög") should give place to the interpretation of prunginn already offered by Reichardt: Rigsfmla 4: prunginn sáõom vollgestopft, gequollen (vom Brot). HHu II, 45: prunginn ekka mit Sorge bis zum Bersten erfüllt. Fjçlsv. 24: pryngva ekka mit Sorge bis zum Bersten erfüllen. So wie die Distel nach dem Sommer bis zum Bersten erfüllt ist mit Samen, dem Zerspringen nah, so wird [Gerör] von ihrer unbefriedigten Begierde erfüllt sein, der Zerstörung entgegensehend (p. 491). The OE charms provide images of "strong" plants resisting external forces; for example, the plantain in "The Nine Herbs Charm" (No. 2) withstood the weight of chariots and cavalcades of queens, brides and bulls, and the prose instructions for Metrical Charm 4 call for "feverfew and the red nettle that grows through (the wall of) a house and plantain."3 But in Charm 9 a "weak" or rather weakening plant is called for, and the "sere wood" and "fragile" thistle are succumbing to internal forces. This is almost certainly the meaning of Prunginn in Skírnismál also. 1 Cf. HD A, s. v. verdorren , vertrocken , col. 1560-63 and the particularly beautiful example, No. 12 in Folktales of England , edd. K. Briggs and R. Tongue (Chicago, 1965). 2 See Bosworth-Toller, s. v. breodan; Suppl., s. v. breopan, breap; Add. and Corr., s. v. breap, breopan , brepel, bripel ; OED, s. v. br e the, brethel , brothel. 3 So Storms' (p. 141) and others' (cf. Dobbie's note) interpretation of feferfuige and seo reade ne tele, de purh arn inwyxõ, and wegbrade; Magoun, p. 19 objects: "Dem Sinn gemäss halte ich diese Deutung aber für höchst unwahrscheinlich, denn der damalige englische Hausbau hätte kaum eine Innepflanzenkultur begünstigen können. Vielmehr haben wir mit einem selbständigen Beleg des Wortes, das als 2. Element des Kompositums Rug-ern 'Roggenernte, August (?), September (?)' vorkommt ... und das hier etwa '(wachsen- des) Getreide' heissen muss. Das Ganze heisst also: 'der Biensaug, der durch das Getreide einwächst.'" The word onn in Skm. 31 supports Magoun 's point.</page><page sequence="6">Cursing with the Thistle 31 Magnus Olsen asked, "Hvorfor sammenlignes Gerd netop med tidslen?" I believe the answer does not lie wholly in a conception of the thistle as opposed to fertility (as argued by Olsen); for despite grain-stealing thistle daemons there appears to be no one folkloristic role of the thistle to account for its use in Skírnismál.1 Nor is the explanation a purely social one as in the realistic agricultural role of the weed in the interpretations of Sahl- gren and Dronke or purely poetic or rhetorical as asserted by Reichardt. Rather the answer must begin with the probable existence of an old, perhaps common Germanic, tradition of cursing with the thistle - a role that its form with prominent 4 'head," autumnal "fragility," and annual "death" might easily suggest. The Skírnismál poet's accomplishment lies not in having invented the thistle simile but in having selected from among the topoi available the traditional, magical simile that would be poetically most effective. Thus GerÖr is not compared to "coal on a hearth," "dung on a wall," "water in a pail," or even to dry wood rotting. The poet's choice of the thistle is more apt: the thistle is anthropomorphic; and its brittle dryness in autumn is the antithesis of the fluid suppleness of a nubile girl in the spring of life.2 A curse creates for the accursed a negative of the hoped-for or expected world, reflecting inversely the normal world of the curser and his victim. In Skirnismal all the elements of the curse proper are negative transforma- tions of the hoped-for world of the maiden Gerör and systematically threat- en the inversion of all the hopes and expectations of fruitful womanhood; and this relationship between the world of the curse and the alternative offered by Freyr, implicit throughout the poem, is expressed openly in certain phrases, such as: grát at gamni ; horfa heimi or, snugga heliar til; and in the contrast between the drink in the world of the curse, getta hland&gt; 1 HD A, s. v. Distel , cols. 301-02, shows that it appears in folklore in various roles, in bono as well as in malo. 2 This argument for the aptness of the thistle simile and what follows below depend on the assumption that the curse is integral to the poem. Finnur Jónsson considered Skm. "sà godt som slet ikke interpolerei" {Litt. hist. , p. 178); but Reichardt (pp. 481-85; cf. Felix Niedner, "Skírnis för," ZDA 30 [1886], 149 and Boer, pp. 69-70) has forcefully questioned this, and he has been followed by some influential scholars (Sveinsson, p. 279). To my mind the case for regarding the curse as integral and in some sense "original" is all but proven in Dronke's learned and elegant essay, and I can only add that the curse comes as Skirnir's third and most powerful inducement (after bribery and violence), forming a well-known rhetorical pattern in agreement with "epic laws."</page><page sequence="7">32 JOSEPH HARRIS and the œdri dryccia she will never have (i.e., the goat's mead of the gods). She is to marry a three-headed troll or remain without a man if she refuses the glorious god of fertility, to suffer lust, madness, and physical torture, to hate her food and to subsist in the hateful society of trolls. This is the context of the comparison to the brittle autumn thistle; and although the OE charms show that magical similes are common in curses, the thistle simile is the only one used in the Skírnismál curse.1 Its appearance at the climax - or at least a climax - of the curse must have been carefully calculated, and its positioning and the fact that it is the only magical simile used give it rhetorical effect. However, its use is not rein poetisch (Reichardt, p. 491) but first of all magical and only secondarily poetic and rhetorical. Finally, we may analyse the curse proper as "myth" according to its 4 'paradigmatic structure" or conceptual order and without regard to its sequential ordering (rhetoric) or its dramatic application to Gerör.2 All the elements of the mythic world adumbrated in the curse proper fall into four symmetrically conceived spheres of life: Social Life (environment, Private Life (sex) : reputation, etc.) J)ic gumna synir . . . aeva sé; at Med Jiursi f)rih&lt;pfÖoÖom J&gt;ú scalt ae undrsiónom 1)ú veröir . . . goöom; nara eòa verlaus vera; Hrímgrímnir ¡ ara J&gt;úfo á scaltu ár sitia; horfa heimi heitir Jmrs er ļ&gt;ic hafa seal; J&gt;itt geö ór, snugga heliar til; içtna goröom í; grípi; (not part of curse proper: ec til hrimļ)ursa hallar; gapiõu grin- fyrbyö ... ec fyrirbanna, manna dom frá; fyr nágrindr neöan; á viöar glaum mani, manna nyt mani), rótom; vílmegir . . .

L. Fischer, "The Sociopsychological Analysis of Folktales," CA 4 (1963), 248-55, with</page><page sequence="8">Cursing with the Thistle 33 This table omits the thistle, the only element of the curse proper that cannot fit one or another of the categories. It falls outside all four cate- gories because it is removed to the more mysterious world of metaphor and is metaphorically applicable to all four of the categories: the thistle as hated weed (Social Life), dry and spiritually and sexually inert in the fall (Mental and Private Life), on the point of bursting and perishing (Physical Life). Thus the thistle simile seems to stand as a summary, re- flecting but not participating in the categories of the conceptual structure of the curse, and as the mysterious "other" it comes, perhaps, as the curse's own most powerful element.1 The answer to Olsen's question, then, is complex. At the primary, magico-traditional level, Gerör is compared to a thistle because such a comparison was among the magical similes made available by cursing tradition. The selection of precisely the thistle as especially apt and the placing of the simile were principally dramatic and rhetorical decisions based in part on the unflattering implications of the contrast with the fertile and fruitful alternative offered by Freyr. On a deeper level, how- ever, the curser's leap from direct creation of a negative world to the in- direction of the metaphorical cannot be assigned to either only magical or only poetic motivation. We are here at a structural level where rhetoric and magic are indistinguishable. Stanford University Stanford, California Joseph Harris references. A few elements of the curse proper could be assigned to different categories according to our interpretation of them; for example, geõ, probably meaning "lust," could belong with topi, ópi , and the rest as a mental or even with morn as a physical affliction instead of among the facts of sexual life; morn itself seems to mean "wasting sickness" and could be regarded as mental or physical as contemporary medical principles might dictate; and kostr , here interpreted as "food," is really polysemous and alludes simultaneously also to GerÖr's lack of freedom and lack of a proper man (cf. Dronke, n. 5 and Reichardt, p. 490). 1 Cf. Olsen, p. 23: "Det var, maa vi taenke os, den kraftigste trusel, runeristeren kjendte, mot den kvinde, hvis motstand han vilde bryte." 3</page></plain_text>
