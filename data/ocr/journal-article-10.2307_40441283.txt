<plain_text><page sequence="1">Public Affairs Quarterly Volume 14, Number 2, April 2000 THE FAILURE OF TRADITIONAL ARGUMENTS IN THE VIVISECTION DEBATE T. Ryan Gregory Introduction animal experimentation can trace its roots back to the practice of vivisection (L. vivus, living + sectio, cutting) - that is, the cutting of living organisms - which began in the time of the ancients. Vivisection was later reinstituted in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by the anatomist-physiologists, and although there was some expression of distaste for the practice in the eighteenth century, it did not become a major public concern until the mid-1800s.12 Now, 150 years later, the debate has not diminished. Indeed, it is still of sufficient import to make its way onto the cover of recent issues of two popular science magazines.3 Even the term "vivisection" has survived, and is now used to refer to any destructive use of animals for the purposes of medical research or learning. Not surprisingly, its barbaric connotations make it especially popular among those opposed to the practice. (It is used here only as shorthand for the more tedious term "nonhuman animal experimentation.") Although advances in cell culture and other such methodologies have expanded the investigative repertoire available to researchers, nonhu- man experimentation continues to form the backbone of medical science. Medical research consumes - annually, and at least - 3 million nonhu- man animals4 in the U.K., 2 million in Canada, and 18 million in the United States.5 The often heated clash between animal activists and the medical research establishment is therefore not difficult to comprehend. Just as it was more than a century and a half ago, the issue of vivisec- tion is currently debated in two distinct fora - the first scientific, the other philosophical. 159</page><page sequence="2">1 60 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY Scientific Arguments The resources available to the medical profession are not limitless. Time, money, and personnel must all be distributed efficiently if the treatment of disease and the alleviation of suffering are to be accom- plished effectively. The issue of how best to invest scarce medical and research resources is one that should be discussed even in the absence of other pressing moral concerns. Thus, establishing the efficacy of non- human animal experimentation as a practice designed to further human medicine is important on economic as well as philosophical grounds. As such, it is not surprising that a great deal of effort has been put forth by both sides of the debate in order to establish vivisection's usefulness (or lack thereof) in the advancement of medicine. Before discussing the his- torical influence and current utility of nonhuman animal models, however, it is important to consider some fundamental limitations in- herent in their use. Human disease and nonhuman models Although often considered adequate for the study of human diseases, nonhuman models are presented a priori with three fundamental limita- tions that make them necessarily suboptimal. The first of these is based on the inescapable fact that no two species (and, indeed, no two indi- vidual members of any one species) are exactly identical. Although some proponents of vivisection continue to assert that "there are no basic dif- ferences between the physiology of laboratory animals and humans,"6 most researchers acknowledge the uniqueness of all species. As a brief but poignant illustration, one need only consider the responses of vari- ous animals to some well-known chemicals. For example, strychnine - a deadly poison to humans - is harmless to monkeys, chickens, and guinea pigs. Sheep can consume enormous quantities of arsenic, which is fatal to humans in small amounts, while hemlock, assassin of Socrates, can be ingested without ill effect by mice, sheep, goats, and horses. Finally, phencyclidine ("angel dust"), which drives humans into a frenzy, is used as a sedative for horses. Of course, such examples do not necessarily imply that all nonhuman animal research is futile, nor do they indicate that humans are somehow divorced from the remainder of the animal kingdom. They simply show that the physiology of each species is to a certain extent unique, and that results obtained using one species as a model cannot with absolute confidence be extrapolated to members of another species. Presumably, a treatment developed on a mouse could not be implemented without problems on a goat, for example.</page><page sequence="3">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 161 A second limitation of nonhuman animal experimentation arises from potential differences in the diseases themselves. Firstly, strains of patho- gens often vary in significant ways depending on their particular host, thereby complicating the extrapolation of treatments developed against a disease found in one species to that found in another. Secondly, dis- eases induced artificially in experimental subjects often show only a superficial correspondence to diseases that develop naturally. Indeed, numerous cases are known in which artificially induced diseases in non- humans "differed substantially from their human 'counterparts' in both cause and clinical course."7 This may, of course, change as transgenic technologies allow the production of organisms capable of contracting the same strains of diseases as human beings.8 Finally, the stress experienced by nonhuman subjects can have pro- found effects on the results of medical experiments. Stress is known to greatly influence key physiological parameters such as metabolism and immune system function,7'91011 and can therefore be expected to distort the results of any studies that employ stressful methodologies (e.g., those that invoke fear, cause pain, or involve confinement). This problem is confounded first by the fact that anesthesia also affects important physi- ological functions, and secondly because the alleviation of stress in human subjects provided by the "placebo effect" is unavailable in non- humans, thereby making the disruptive influence of stress in nonhumans all but inescapable. These unavoidable limitations of nonhuman animal models are often viewed by anti-vivisectionists as fatal to the case in favor of their use. As Kaufman7 puts it, "because animal experimentation focuses on arti- ficially created pathology, involves confounding variables, and is undermined by species differences in anatomy and physiology, it is an inherently unsound way to investigate human disease processes." But despite the admitted suboptimality of nonhuman models, the question re- mains: Does vivisection lead to, and is it necessary for, medical progress? The historical role of vivisection It is tempting to assume, because it has persisted so long, that vivi- section has been enormously beneficial to human medicine in the past. Obviously, this is the position adopted by those who continue to employ it. Indeed, supporters of vivisection have produced impressive lists of examples of its effectiveness, including increases in life expectancy, the development of numerous antibiotics and vaccines used in the treatment of various diseases, and the advent of many life-saving surgical proce- dures.612 However, many anti-vivisectionists argue that not only have</page><page sequence="4">1 62 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY experiments using nonhumans been greatly overestimated in their im- portance, but that in many cases they have been downright harmful. It has been argued, for example, that the incidences of diseases like scarlet fever, whooping cough, measles, and diphtheria all declined as a result of preventive measures - that is, improvements in diet and sanita- tion - before the advent of interventionist medicine.13 Even smallpox, the champion-story of vaccination, is known to have declined largely because of prevention, and not solely as a result of intensive interven- tion.1314 Yet, it is important to note that despite this often forgotten input of prevention, medical intervention in the form of vaccinations has played an integral role in the ultimate control - and sometimes even total eradi- cation - of many diseases. A cogent example of this is provided by formerly widespread diseases such as poliomyelitis.1215 However, even in the case of polio, the true nature of vivisection's influence is far from clear-cut. Early experiments using monkeys gave a false indication that poliovirus infection involved only the nervous sys- tem, and resulted in a delay in the development of tissue culture methods (which later employed human as well as monkey cells) necessary for the production of a vaccine.10 Thus, in this case the use of nonhuman mod- els was important for - but also substantially impeded - the development of an effective treatment. The use of nonhuman animal models has some- times delayed the development of much-needed preventive action as well; for example, by failing to identify tobacco and asbestos as carcinogenic inhalants, and alcohol as a cause of cirrhosis.71011 Because of the difficulty of treatment presented by the complexity of many disease processes, medical research programs are seldom restricted solely to experimental approaches. Most often, a component of clinical investigation is included in the study of a disease, although the impor- tance of such non-experimental work is often overlooked by proponents of nonhuman animal experimentation. For example, much of the work on diabetes involved human studies, although this is generally ignored in discussions of the development of treatments for this disease.11 Simi- larly, Leader and Stark16 pointed out that nonhumans were essential to the research of nearly 3/4 of the Nobel Prizes in physiology and medi- cine (up to 1987), but did not specify studies that employed cell cultures and non-invasive behavioral observations, and neglected to describe the actual input of nonhuman animal research in cases where other (i.e., clinical) methods were used.8 Despite the views of Claude Bernard - who is considered "the father of modern biomedicine" - that nonhuman experimental research is fundamental to medical progress, and that "clini- cal information no more suffices for physicians than knowledge of minerals suffices for chemists and physicists,"17 the fact remains that,</page><page sequence="5">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 163 for the reasons discussed above, clinical studies focusing on naturally occurring human diseases are often inherently favorable to those which employ artificially infected nonhumans as models. It is difficult to determine the exact level of relevance that vivisec- tion has had in past medical progress. To be sure, some advancements were aided, while others were impeded, by the use of nonhuman sub- jects. Other breakthroughs may have occurred with or without the influence of vivisection. Most likely, its importance has been exagger- ated by those in favor of its continued use, and underestimated by those opposed to it. However, even assuming that a resolution could be found amid the various interpretations of medical history, this would hardly answer the question of whether the practice of vivisection should con- tinue to be implemented in medical research. Wind- and steam-powered vessels were certainly vital in the exploration of much of the globe, but this fact in no way indicates that they should continue to be seen as useful even as newer and more efficient technologies develop. In this regard, scientific arguments for and against the use of vivisection are best addressed in the context of modern medical research. The present utility of vivisection Today, as historically, experiments using nonhuman animals are de- signed to accomplish one of three primary tasks: (i) to test the efficacy and safety of new drugs and treatments, (ii) to develop and test cures for specific diseases, such as cancer and AIDS, or (iii) to further the under- standing of medically relevant biological processes through basic physiological and psychological research. As such, much of the debate over vivisection focuses on its utility in each of these three areas, with proponents asserting that it is essential, and critics arguing that it is counterproductive. It would be very desirable to know, for both eco- nomic and philosophical reasons, whether vivisection is indeed important to medical advance in these areas, or if it should be abandoned as ar- chaic and outmoded. Unfortunately, such an answer is not readily available. Drug testing The testing of drugs is the most questionable of all uses of nonhuman animals, since it is here that species differences have their greatest in- fluence. Indeed, it has been asserted that nonhuman animal trials are generally no more than 50 percent (and sometimes as little as 20 per- cent) accurate in determining the efficacy and safety of drugs for humans.713 Even rats and mice, which are obviously much more similar to one another than either is to humans, show only about 70 percent congruence of results in tests of toxicity.18 Because of this discordance</page><page sequence="6">1 64 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY among species, some medical professionals opposed to vivisection sug- gest that toxicological studies using nonhumans should be abandoned entirely in favor of in vitro tests employing human tissue.7 The effects of such inaccuracies are most profound when they lead to "false negatives," whereby a dangerous drug or treatment is used with confidence. in humans because it has no ill effects in some nonhumans. Perhaps the best known example of such a false negative is provided by the case of thalidomide, which was produced by the German pharma- ceutical company Chemie Grunenthal and distributed as an anti-nauseant to pregnant women in the late 1950s. Although it was deemed safe in nonhuman animal trials, the drug was later found to induce serious malformities in the developing fetus, leading to the births of thousands of deformed children before it was taken off the market. Of course, there is a great deal of disagreement as to whether thalidomide accurately re- flects the potential dangers of using nonhuman animal models to test the safety of drugs developed for use in humans. Many proponents of nonhuman animal testing point out that thalidomide was not tested on pregnant subjects, and suggest that more testing would therefore have prevented the tragedy.619 Anti-vivisectionists, on the other hand, argue that only certain species - most importantly, not those normally used in safety trials - show effects akin to those found in humans, and that ad- ditional nonhuman testing would have been even more misleading.13 Unfortunately, the thalidomide example is by no means isolated, although the aftermath of such misplaced confidence in nonhuman safety testing is seldom as severe. In fact, of the 198 new drugs marketed between 1976 and 1985 reviewed by the U.S. General Accounting Office, 52 per- cent were found to have "serious postapproval risks" not predicted by nonhuman animal tests and limited clinical trials.11 In addition to such false negatives, the problems posed by species differences can lead to "false positives," where the development or re- lease of an effective drug or treatment is delayed because it has deleterious effects on nonhuman test subjects. As an example, acetyl- salicylic acid (aspirin), one of the most commonly used pain relievers, causes birth defects in rats, mice, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, and monkeys, and poisons cats at mass-corrected human doses. Similarly, penicillin (which, as animal rights activists hasten to point out, was developed without the use of nonhuman subjects), might never have reached the public had it been tested on hamsters, guinea pigs, or cats, to whom it is lethal. However, again there is disagreement over the significance of these facts. Pro-vivisectionists point out that most often such inaccura- cies are the result of differences in the effective dosages (based on differences in body size, metabolism, etc.) for different species. Penicillin,</page><page sequence="7">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 165 for example, is fatal to guinea pigs at mass-corrected human doses only indirectly because of its effects on the animals' natural gut flora.619 Moreover, it has been argued that Sir Alexander Fleming (penicillin's discoverer) misconstrued the drug's mode of action by performing tests only in vitro, and did not learn of its utility as a general antibiotic until he performed experiments on mice.19 To be sure, there is a correlation between nonhuman animal research and medical advancement, but this stems in large part from the fact that, as required by law since 1938 (in the U.S.), all new medications, surgi- cal procedures, and prosthetic devices must be tested on nonhumans prior to their use on humans.1520 In any case, it is clear that the usefulness of nonhuman animal trials - as currently practiced, and without a proper recognition of the influence of interspecific differences - may be greatly overstated by its proponents. It is also clear that the claims of anti-vivi- sectionists as to the danger of nonhuman animal models are often exaggerated. Of course, even the conclusive demonstration of the inac- curacy of nonhuman animal trials in numerous cases would not be sufficient to dismiss its use entirely. On the other hand, it is important to note that today (as historically) negative results go substantially underreported, such that a survey of the primary scientific literature - even if replete with examples of vivisection's success - would not provide an accurate illustration of its true efficacy.21 Cancer and AIDS In 1971, the United States launched an official "War on Cancer," which many believed would lead to a cure for the disease by 1976. Now - more than a quarter of a century later, and after annual investments consistently measured in the billions - the threat to human well-being posed by cancer has not diminished. This staggering lack of progress, anti-vivisectionists argue, is a direct result of the medical community's "unwarranted preoccupation with animal research."10 Not surprisingly, many investigators involved in cancer research contend that nonhuman models have been - and will continue to be - vital to the ongoing war against this disease.22 However, given the suggestion by some authors that 80-90 percent of all human cancers are preventable,13 such an insis- tence on the development of an interventionist cure may indeed be unreasonable. As such, a diversion of resources away from nonhuman experimental approaches in favor of improved preventive measures may be called for purely on the basis of economic concerns - the potentially enormous waste of nonhuman lives notwithstanding. A similar situation exists in AIDS research, which continues to con- sume large numbers of nonhuman animal subjects (including primates) with few tangible results. In fact, nearly all the major medical advances</page><page sequence="8">1 66 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY in the fight against this disease have come from human-based studies. The identification of the disease and its modes of transmission, and the development of key treatments (e.g., AZT, 3TC, and protease inhibi- tors) have all come from human clinical research and in vitro studies, and not from nonhuman animal experiments.71011'23 Indeed, it has been stated that no adequate nonhuman models exist for this disease,724 sug- gesting that the continued focus on nonhuman animal experimentation may be unjustified in this case as well. Thus, the true role of vivisection in the struggle to cure many diseases, although certainly not insignifi- cant, remains ambiguous. It is clear, however, that a dogmatic faith in the experimental approach (at the expense of a philosophy rooted in pre- vention) cannot continue unquestioned. Basic research In addition to studies using nonhuman animal models in the pursuit of specific medical goals, nonhumans are often used in basic physiologi- cal, anatomical, and behavioral research. This type of curiosity-driven investigation using nonhuman animals is often justified because of its chances of leading to serendipitous discoveries. Yet, the importance of such accidental discoveries in the progress of medicine is dubious at best.25-2627 Moreover, because adaptive evolution often results in the de- velopment of numerous solutions to common problems, the physiologies of nonhuman animals can be used only as analogies for human systems. The accuracy of these models can therefore be established only by di- rect comparison with data obtained using humans, which then makes the use of the original model unnecessary. Of course, once a model is established as reliable, it may provide medically relevant insights in the course of more directed study, but this work would then presumably fall into one of the two previous categories discussed, and would be subject to the problems inherent in studies of those types. In summary, despite intense debate, vivisection has not been shown to be ineffectual, nor has its usefulness (much less its necessity) been demonstrated conclusively - an important consideration given the costs involved (in dollars, labor-hours, and lives). As it currently stands, its continued use can be neither discredited nor validated based solely on scien- tific arguments, and a continued emphasis on this line of argumentation by either side of the debate is unlikely to break the long-running stalemate. Philosophical Arguments Obviously, the efficacy of nonhuman animal experimentation remains very much in question. But even assuming for the sake of argument that it has been, and will continue to be, necessary for the advancement of</page><page sequence="9">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 167 human medicine, there are profound moral considerations that must be factored into the calculation of its social acceptability. Usefulness in the acquisition of knowledge does not in itself provide moral justifica- tion for an action. As the great playwright and anti-vivisectionist George Bernard Shaw14 pointed out, people have learned a great deal from earth- quakes, fires, and warfare, but one would hardly be justified in recreating these things in order to learn more. Thus, in addition to the ongoing arguments over the role of vivisection in medical advancement, there is often fierce debate over the moral status of nonhuman animal experi- mentation. Those involved in this debate - be they professional ethicists or lay people - invariably invoke one of two traditional moral theories, which, like the scientific arguments described above, have been wholly insufficient to settle the issue. Utilitarianism - Do nonhumans suffer? The first, and more commonly invoked, moral theory is that of utili- tarianism, first developed and applied to the issue of the treatment of nonhuman animals by Jeremy Bentham in his 1789 work An Introduc- tion to the Principles of Morals and Legislation ("The question is not, Can they reason! nor Can they talk? but, Can they sufferV). Bentham proposed his "principle of utility" as a means of evaluating the moral acceptability of an action, and insisted that an action was morally justi- fied only when it could be expected to maximize the total amount of happiness purveyed to the greatest number of individuals, or, conversely, to minimize the total amount of suffering experienced. This utilitarian "cost-benefit" approach underlies most of the relevant legislation regu- lating nonhuman animal experimentation, and forms the basis of the arguments of the leading proponent of Animal Liberation, the Austra- lian philosopher Peter Singer.28 Not surprisingly, utilitarianism's moral calculus has been used by both sides of the vivisection debate to pro- duce results resonant with their beliefs.1729 However, neither side's utilitarian argument is without serious flaws. Nonhuman pain The most obvious difficulty for pro-vivisectionists who employ a utili- tarian defense is that, in order for vivisection to be morally justified, it must be demonstrated that the net suffering inflicted upon nonhumans is more than compensated for by the alleviation of suffering in humans. Moreover, it is not sufficient that few nonhumans suffer and many hu- mans benefit, since by this argument a few humans could be justifiably sacrificed, even in painful and horrific ways, and without their consent, if for the good of many. Clearly, this proposition is deemed unaccept- able given that humans, despite being necessarily superior experimental</page><page sequence="10">168 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY subjects, are not used. Instead, pro-vivisectionists who employ a strictly utili- tarian line of argumentation are faced with the difficult task of demonstrating conclusively that nonhumans actually suffer less than do humans. The revival of (literally) vivisectionist practices during the seven- teenth century led to vast improvements in the understanding of basic physiological processes such as the circulation of the blood, but also involved some experimental practices that would undoubtedly be con- sidered unacceptable today. However, it is important to note that the researchers carrying out this work were not sadists. For the most part, they held the view attributed (somewhat erroneously30) to René Descartes that nonhuman animals were unfeeling, thoughtless, soulless "automata" incapable of experiencing pain and suffering.2 Some of the greatest think- ers in history - including Voltaire, Hume, and Darwin - vehemently rejected this notion, and it is now very seldom propagated. Today, all vertebrates (or at the very least, birds and mammals) are generally be- lieved to experience pain.293132'33 The question, then, is not whether most animals used in medical experiments are capable of feeling pain, but whether, and to what degree, their pain is comparable to that experi- enced by normal adult human beings. Although the specifics of pain sensation in different species may be extremely difficult to elucidate, it is possible to examine the likelihood of the existence of pain perception in different types of organisms. Pain ("nociception") is an evolved, adaptive, protective sensation that oc- curs in response to an injurious stimulus and inspires an organism to take action; that is, to avoid the source of the pain, and to avoid such noxious stimuli in the future. Sedentary organisms such as plants, which are incapable of either an escape response or learned aversion, would obviously not be expected to have evolved such a sensory mechanism, nor do they possess the requisite physiological structures for the per- ception of pain. Insects, on the other hand, can and do avoid dangerous stimuli and possess relatively complex nervous systems, so the possi- bility that they experience pain cannot be dismissed. Vertebrates in general, and mammals in particular, have the neces- sary anatomical features, capacity for behavioral response and learning (as evidenced by B. F. Skinner's experiments with opérant condition- ing), and relevant evolutionary histories to make it very likely that they do, in fact, feel pain. In this regard, some researchers have attempted to determine objective neurological and behavioral criteria by which to gauge the presence or absence of pain in nonhuman animals.3239 This has not resolved the issue, however, particularly in groups such as the cephalopod mollusks, which meet some, but not all, of the criteria.32 Yet, even the presence of the necessary neurological structures and behavioral</page><page sequence="11">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 169 indicators is not enough to satisfy some solipsist philosophers. More- over, the still-prevalent philosophy implicit in the behaviorism of C. Lloyd Morgan and B. F. Skinner demands that nonhuman behaviors be ex- plained in terms of the lowest psychological faculties possible, meaning that often not even the most obvious displays of pain or fear are interpreted in human terms.5 It would seem, however, that based on the profound moral consequences involved, the benefit of the doubt should be granted in cases where there is uncertainty. Notably, the evidence for pain perception in in- fant humans is no better than that for nonhuman mammals. To make matters more complex, the reactions associated with pain and fear in human beings may not exist in nonhumans, even if they are capable of experiencing these sensations. Certainly, an inability to ar- ticulate pain or fear in a verbal language is one example (of course, infants do not use language to communicate their discomfort either). However, it must also be noted that many animals, when (if ?) gripped with fear, would not be expected to flee the way a frightened human might, but would instead remain immobilized. Similarly, it may be coun- terproductive for an animal susceptible to notice by predators to show its pain (and by association, injury or weakness) outwardly. Grazing animals that continue to feed normally despite significant injuries may do so not for lack of pain, but because their somatic repair mechanisms require a constant dietary input. In these cases, an anthropomorphic evalua- tion of pain perception in nonhumans could be greatly misleading.932 The portions of the brain responsible for the perception of pain and fear are considered primitive and are related only indirectly in function to those associated with language, memory, and cognition, which have become highly accentuated in humans. Thus, those characteristics that (presumably) distinguish humans from other animals, namely episodic memory, linguistic ability, the capacity to internalize the natural world, and the ability to consider the future consequences of actions, are not relevant in the consideration of pain perception. Certainly, the very fact that human analgesics and anesthetics exert effects on many nonhumans32 can be taken as evidence to this effect. For the most part, pain and fear are subjective, visceral experiences divorced from conscious thought, as illustrated by the fact that, despite the undeniable mental acuities possessed by human beings, no one seems capable of remembering, de- scribing, or predicting just what pain feels like. In addition, the quality known as "intelligence" is unrelated to pain perception. Few would ar- gue, for example, that Mensans are more sensitive to pain than individuals who would perform less well on standardized intelligence tests. More- over, even those whose "higher" mental functions are impaired, such as the mentally handicapped or insane, are still capable of experiencing</page><page sequence="12">170 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY pain. Or so, one would hope, most people would assume in the absence of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. In fact, there is no obvious reason not to expect certain nonhuman animals to be capable of experi- encing more pain than humans. Many nonhuman animal species have evolved greater visual, olfactory, and auditory sensitivities than humans, and it is not unreasonable to suggest that some have evolved heightened capacities for pain or fear relative to humans as well, as, for example, among prey species. In any event, the assertion that nonhumans experi- ence less severe pain than their human beneficiaries - perhaps the simplest attempt to corroborate a utilitarian defense of vivisection - seems unjustified in the light of the presently available evidence. That nonhuman animals likely do not experience less significant pain than their human counterparts does not necessarily indicate that a utili- tarian approach to supporting vivisection is doomed, however, since the concept of pain and that of suffering cannot be equated as such. It is possible, although far from established, that humans are capable of modes of suffering in addition to pain that are not experienced by other ani- mals. The mere anticipation of pain is, for example, known to be a prominent source of stress among human patients.34 In addition, human beings may experience long-lasting psychological trauma or emotional and social hardships as a result of injury.31 Aside from the immense dif- ficulties involved in the quantification of pain, this added complication makes the computation of utilitarian mathematics all but impossible when comparing across species. Further complications arise as a result of the inferiority of nonhuman models, which necessitates the use of more individuals than would be required if humans were used. Whether those nonhumans used in ex- periments suffer proportionately less than humans is, of course, not known. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that as the likelihood of causing human-like suffering is reduced by the selection of subjects of more and more distant phylogenetic association to humans, so too is the physiological correspondence reduced, thereby necessitating the use of more individuals in what amounts to a utilitarian catch-22. Of course, even if nonhuman animals could be shown to suffer sig- nificantly less than humans, the utilitarian mathematics could only hold if every attempt to further minimize the suffering of the experimental subjects were made in all cases. Indeed, many pro-vivisectionists assert that the suffering of the subjects should be minimized whenever pos- sible, and most relevant legislation emphasizes this same point.35 Yet, the abundance of horrifying evidence of human callousness, both anec- dotal and confirmed, suggests that the moral and emotional detachment that is often necessitated by vivisection negates the possibility of achieving</page><page sequence="13">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 171 even this modest utilitarian ideal.36 Finally, it must be recognized that even if the use of interventionist medicine did indeed require the input of vivisection and did minimize suffering now, it is not clear that such a strategy would minimize suffering in the long run. A great deal of mis- ery has emerged, for example, as a result of overpopulation in underdeveloped nations where infant mortality has been drastically and suddenly reduced by well-meaning medical practitioners. Moral asymmetries In addition to the difficulties posed by a reliance on the nebulous concept of "suffering," utilitarian analyses are also confused by some important moral asymmetries specific to the vivisection debate. Firstly, there is the differential moral status of commissions versus omissions. That is, the difference in the moral implications of committing an evil directly, and simply failing to prevent one. Most people would agree, for example, that failing to save a drowning child - as reprehensible as it is - pales in comparison to actually holding the child's head under water.21 Specifically, vivisection involves the direct infliction of suffer- ing on nonhumans, while a cessation of this practice would (presumably) result in the failure to prevent human suffering. More importantly, the harm perpetrated on nonhuman subjects is definite, while the medical benefit is only possible, since there is no guarantee that any particular research program will provide useful results. This is especially true of basic research, which is often defended on the grounds that it may some- day be of value to medical progress. In some cases, such as with the delay in the development of a polio vaccine and the failure to recognize smoking as a cause of cancer, vivisection inadvertently commits both direct and indirect wrongs, by not only causing harm to experimental subjects, but also by failing to prevent human suffering. For these rea- sons, it has often been argued that experiments using nonhumans cannot possibly be justified on utilitarian grounds unless the probability of suc- cess is very high,212531 which may, in fact, be close to never. There is also a morally relevant difference between minimizing suf- fering and maximizing pleasure. It is conceivable, for example, that the violent death of one individual could provide great pleasure to an entire coliseum of spectators, and could therefore be justified in a utilitarian sense. Most people would argue - utilitarians included - that no such trade-off of pain for pleasure can be justified. Yet, this exchange is of- ten made surreptitiously in the utilitarian defense of vivisection. The development of treatments for many diseases, such as those caused by practices like smoking and drinking and those transmitted by unsafe sexual encounters, and injuries sustained during dangerous but enjoy- able activities require just such an exchange of nonhuman suffering for</page><page sequence="14">172 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY human pleasure (or irresponsibility). If trading pain for pleasure is deemed unacceptable, then vivisectionist practices aimed at treating such preventable ailments clearly cannot be justified. The associated impli- cations for the use of nonhumans for fashion or sport, in the testing of cosmetics and other convenience products, and in the production of gour- met food and aphrodisiacs should be obvious.825 Finally, there is a clear disparity between those who suffer (nonhu- mans) and those who benefit (humans) from vivisection.2131 It is often pointed out by vivisection's supporters that it has benefited not only humans, but many nonhumans as well,1237 but this has not been a ubiq- uitous effect. It is restricted to those animals considered economically or socially useful, such as livestock and pets, and is motivated almost entirely by anthropocentric concerns.38 Tellingly, health care for rats is nonexistent. Suffering as moral absolute? The fundamental assumption made by both pro- and anti-vivisection- ist utilitarians is that "suffering," and the prevention thereof, represents an objective moral absolute that was discovered (not invented) by hu- man beings. That this is so - indeed, that any such objective moral truths exist at all - has been challenged by some authors.39 Indeed, although many people believe that "suffering is the very paradigm of evil,"25 it is disturbingly easy to find examples where financial concerns and political or ethnic boundaries have superseded any such consideration of suffering. Realistically, it seems that suffering is invoked largely as a conve- nience. A simple thought experiment to illustrate this point: Imagine a race of technologically advanced extraterrestrials who possess highly developed nervous systems, and who are capable of physical and emo- tional anguish (as well as intellectual achievement) far beyond that of mere humans. If painful experiments using human subjects could poten- tially (or even definitely) prevent a great deal of suffering among these beings, would humans surrender themselves willingly to such proce- dures? And if not, would these beings be considered justified in using human subjects without consent? More than likely, the view of suffer- ing as a moral absolute espoused by pro-vivisectionist utilitarians would change drastically in such a case. Some authors suggest that such a di- lemma could never arise, because any beings superior to our species in intellect would also be more ethically advanced, and would therefore be unlikely to mistreat humans.35 However, the evidence available here on Earth indicates quite strongly that technological and intellectual devel- opment do not carry with them the automatic inclination to protect those inferior in these areas.</page><page sequence="15">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 173 Utilitarians favoring the continued use of vivisection are not alone in their inconsistent application of the principle of utility. As Cohen20 points out, "One cannot coherently object to the killing of animals in biomedi- cai investigations while continuing to eat them." This tu quoque argument has been used by defenders of vivisection since the 17th century,2 but does maintain some validity today. Obviously, that nonhumans suffer at the hands of other human enterprises provides no justification for vivi- section, but it is also important for utilitarian consistency that these activities be targeted with a vigor proportionate to the suffering they generate. The millions of nonhuman lives sacrificed for medical research each year (which works out to roughly one animal per person per de- cade11) are as nothing compared to the toll taken in the name of food production, which totals roughly six billion annually.5 Moreover, the intensive farming practices needed to meet this demand ("factory farm- ing"2840) often entail much more suffering than that experienced under regulated laboratory conditions. Finally, it should be clear that a strict reliance on suffering as a moral absolute does not address the subject of death. Specifically, if the suf- fering of experimental subjects could be eliminated (e.g., with the use of anesthetics), then utilitarian arguments would become powerless against vivisection.2535 This is unlikely, however, because of the effects of anesthetics on physiology, and the fact that behavioral observation is often a crucial component of medical experiments. More problematic for most philosophers, however, is the fact that a utilitarian could not argue against the use of human subjects in this case either. Non-consensual human experimentation For most people, including both pro- and anti-vivisectionists, the use of human beings in painful experiments without their consent simply cannot be justified. Although generally considered a necessity, this un- wavering policy of "informed consent" has hindered many studies (such as clinical drug trials41), and produces profound inconsistencies in the application of utilitarian theory to the vivisection debate. In many re- spects, it is not possible to defend vivisection on utilitarian grounds without also admitting the acceptability of human experimentation un- der certain circumstances. Most obviously, humans who are incapable of normal, adult levels of suffering could be subject to use in experiments under a utilitarian analy- sis. Consider, for example, a person with severe brain damage who is emotionally and rationally matched with a normal dog, such that both would experience the same amount of suffering from a painful (but po- tentially beneficial) experiment. (Assume also that both the dog and the</page><page sequence="16">174 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY human are orphans, so that the peripheral suffering of family members can be ignored.) In this case, the strict utilitarian would be forced to choose to use the human, because of the higher benefits achieved from the use of a superior model (with no increase in the "cost" of suffering). The potential victimization of human beings is not limited to severely brain-damaged patients, however. Numerous diseases exist in which the sensations of pain and suffering are diminished, and similar effects are often achieved by the use of narcotics. Few would argue that those af- flicted with such ailments or drug addicts should be used in experiments. Somewhat further down the slippery slope of utilitarian ethics are mem- bers of cultures that encourage extreme discipline and foster a high tolerance for pain. Even the oft-asserted difference in pain tolerance between the sexes could potentially be invoked in a utilitarian computa- tion. When utilitarian mathematics are used exclusively, even a slight differential in suffering can lead to disastrous consequences. In order to avoid such difficulties, philosophers have developed nu- merous additional arguments that seek to protect humans from a purely utilitarian calculation. The most simplistic among these maintains a utili- tarian underpinning, and argues that involuntary experimentation on human subjects would reduce overall happiness by forcing individuals to live in a state of constant fear. Alternatively, some philosophers make emotional appeals to the suffering generated by seeing those with whom one has relationships (both potential and realized) and for whom one feels empathy (that is, one's own kind) used in experiments.4243 Of course, a reliance on such obviously subjective criteria can be very dangerous, especially since "one's own kind" is often defined by racial, religious, sexual, political, or linguistic boundaries. Some more sophisticated arguments involve appeals to moral asym- metries present in the comparison of humans and nonhumans. Many authors argue that the brain-damaged human and the dog described above are morally divergent because of the human's acquired misfortune and the dog's normalcy. The human being, so it is argued, is a member of a group in which the normal condition is one of higher moral worth rela- tive to the normal condition of the dog. Thus, an unfortunate human cannot be compared directly to a dog that has realized its full potential. As Kaufman44 has pointed out quite accurately, however, taking advan- tage of vulnerability should be considered morally reprehensible regardless of whether it arose as a result of misfortune. Stealing from a blind man and stealing from a baby are both wrong, even though their vulnerabilities arise for entirely different reasons. The most common attempt by utilitarians to protect humans from vic- timization was instituted by history's most famous utilitarian, John Stuart Mill, who favored the incorporation of a measure of "quality of life"</page><page sequence="17">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 175 which (predictably) places humans above other animals, and members of the intellectual elite above other people. ("It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.") This view continues to be espoused by both pro- and anti-vivisectionists.25'28'29'31 Even this (self-serving) line of reason- ing cannot eliminate the possibility of certain humans - including the mentally handicapped, the extremely ill, the elderly, the poor, and anyone else deemed to have a lower quality of life - being used in experiments. If one accepts the quality of life argument, the conclusion that certain humans must be chosen as experimental subjects cannot be avoided.845 Clearly, the implementation of utilitarian moral theory to the vivi- section debate is fraught with difficulty. Problems inherent in the definition and quantification of suffering, and in the analyses of costs and benefits, as well as those presented by moral asymmetries and in- consistencies of application, plague the arguments of both pro- and anti-vivisectionists. As such, continued appeals to utilitarian philoso- phy will undoubtedly fail to settle the ethical debate over nonhuman animal experimentation. Kantianism - Do nonhumans have rights? In its simplest formulation, and that usually invoked in the vivisec- tion debate, Kantianism is based on the concept of "rights," whereby rational, free-willed, autonomous beings are protected from mistreat- ment by a deontological principle known as the categorical imperative. Under this view, a moral agent is required to treat these individuals "al- ways as an end, and never merely as a means." (Although such a principle does not necessarily apply only to humans, Kant explicitly denied such rights of nonhuman animals.) The implications for the vivisection de- bate are clear. Pro-vivisectionist Kantians claim that rational beings such as (normal adult) humans cannot be used in experiments no matter what the benefits (and regardless of whether suffering would be involved), while other organisms lacking rights are offered no such protection. In- deed, Cohen20 has gone so far as to consider rights as "trump cards to which interest and advantage must give way." In other words, Kantian determinations of rights outweigh any utilitarian worries about suffer- ing or costs and benefits. Of course, the pro-vivisectionist conclusion drawn from such a view rests heavily on the demonstration that nonhu- mans are indeed without rights. Rationality and rights Aristotle, anticipating the views of Descartes, accepted that nonhu- man animals are capable of both pleasure and pain, but stated that they lack any "power of thinking."46 For St. Thomas Aquinas this "power of</page><page sequence="18">176 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY thinking" was expressed as rationality, while for Kant it was displayed as free will; the difference lies only in the specific character used to assign rights to some and to deny them of others. More recently invoked measures of the Aristotelian "power of thinking" include self-conscious- ness and language; the basic desire to assign rights exclusively to humans is clearly the same. Because Kantian philosophy, at least as typically applied to the vivisection debate, is very straightforward (nonhumans either have rights akin to those of humans, or none at all), the deciding factor lies in the demonstration (or refutation) of rationality (or free will, or self-consciousness, or language) in nonhuman organisms. Un- fortunately for Kantians on both sides of the debate, this has proven no easier than the conclusive demonstration of suffering (or a lack thereof) in organisms other than normal adult humans. According to Aristotle, nonhuman animals exhibit needs and desires comparable to those found among human beings. Tom Regan, today's most prominent anti-vivisectionist Kantian, has carried this further by arguing that some nonhumans also possess beliefs, memories, prefer- ences, and perceptions akin to those of humans, thereby making them worthy of (some) Kantian rights.47 This has, of course, been neither sub- stantiated nor refuted empirically. Many anti-vivisectionists point to examples of mathematical, conceptual, and linguistic abilities in birds, nonhuman primates, and dolphins as evidence of a "power of thinking," but these too are subject to much skepticism. Moreover, it is important to note that even if language or some other "morally relevant" trait did indeed exist among primates or cetaceans, this would not imply that all nonhumans should be protected under the categorical imperative.43 That both pro- and anti-vivisectionists seem to ignore this point illustrates the pervasiveness of an "us versus them" mentality on both sides of the debate, as though "nonhumans" were a real biological category in and of itself. Of course it is not, any more than is, say, "visible minority." Instead, and as Darwin pointed out in his 1871 classic The Descent of Man, consciousness and intelligence likely exist along a continuum, with differences among, as within, species being a matter of degree rather than of kind. Of course, not all consciousness is self-consciousness,22 nor is consciousness an all-or-nothing phenomenon; it is an emergent characteristic produced by the interaction of numerous mental abilities that appear at various times during development28 (and, presumably, evolution). In any event, it is unacceptable for either side of the debate to simply assume that consciousness is (or is not) a uniquely human characteristic. As Nobel Prize-winning immunologist Sir Peter Medewar wrote, "There will, of course, always be doubts about the degree of awareness that animals enjoy. But we should act as if they had a dim</page><page sequence="19">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 177 awareness akin to human consciousness, for humanity and equity com- bine to insist that animals should be given the benefit of any doubt that still persists."48 Reciprocal morality Some authors argue that because they are incapable of reciprocating moral consideration, "other - lower(!) - animals simply cannot be af- forded . . . basic rights."49 Nonhuman animals, it is argued, are unaware of any distinction between right and wrong, and can therefore neither commit evils, nor be protected by the human ethical sense.21-35'4249 Part of this same rationale underlies the pronouncement of non-guilt "by rea- son of insanity"; the inability to distinguish right from wrong can provide partial absolution to even the most monstrous offenders. However, these criminals are provided with special psychiatric care and (importantly) are not - as the pro-vivisectionist argument would seem to demand - stripped of all "basic rights" (such as the right not to be used in painful experiments). The same holds true for young children and the mentally handicapped who, although lacking the moral sense of normal adults, are not without these same basic rights. This aside, the very assumption that all nonhuman animals are with- out a moral sense may be unjustified. Many social species such as canines and nonhuman primates display what appears outwardly to be signs of guilt (an expression of some type of morality). Some pro-vivisectionists argue that the "guilt" displayed by dogs is simply an artifact of human breeding, and that it does not represent even a modest ethical sense. However, cats - which have also been bred intensively as pets - show no such consideration for human concerns. Moreover, the same displays of "guilt" are found in undomesticated wolves. It is therefore likely that dogs do possess a rudimentary moral sense that evolved under a system of dominance hierarchies (in which social faux-pas did not go unpun- ished, and which now often includes a human "alpha male"). Clearly, those who dismiss the possible existence of morality among other species have not abandoned the view that moral laws exist independent of, and await discovery by, human beings. The alternative view - that morality is a his- torically contingent product of evolution - demands no such exclusivity. The domestication and selective breeding of nonhuman animals, a practice that has persisted for ten millennia, is also often invoked in the defense of vivisection. The animals used in medical experiments, many people argue, were bred and raised specifically for that purpose, and their use is thereby justified. A more poignant example of this rationale is provided by the production of transgenic and immunodeficient ani- mals "designed" specifically for use in medical experiments. However, teleological breeding alone cannot provide justification for any acts.</page><page sequence="20">178 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY Firstly, there is obviously the Kantian concern that potential possessors of rights (an issue awaiting resolution) are being used as means to an end. More important, however, is the fact that such an argument does not distinguish between animals bred for medical experimentation, and those that are bred for use in cruel and bloody forms of human enter- tainment, or for the production of luxury clothes items like fur coats. Non-consensual human experimentation (again) Like utilitarianism, Kantian philosophy has the undesirable effect of prescribing, under certain conditions, the non-consensual use of human beings in medical experimentation. Most obviously, human beings inca- pable of rational thought, moral reciprocity, or linguistic communication could be subject to a revoking of rights. This could include anencepha- lic infants, comatose patients, the mentally handicapped or insane, and the senile elderly. More disturbing, however, is the fact that even nor- mal infants and young children could be without rights, given that fully introspective self-consciousness does not develop in human children until the age of about two years.28 Indeed, it is already the case that children and the mentally handicapped are not considered capable of providing informed consent; it is provided for them by a parent or guardian. Nor are children provided with the right to consume alcohol, drive automo- biles, or vote. Certainly, there are excellent reasons for the denial of such rights, but this fact makes it clear that not all humans are consid- ered equal in the characteristics relevant to Kantian morality, thereby making some of them vulnerable to exploitation. Again, many pro-vivisectionist philosophers attempt to protect hu- mans from such potential victimization. Arguments pertaining to the status of some humans as "unfortunate" and appeals to emotional rela- tionships are used in this case as well, but are equally as flawed as those used by utilitarians. Others argue that human beings cannot be used in medical experiments because it would be prohibitively difficult to de- cide which unfortunate humans fall below the moral threshold. Of course, it would be equally (or more) difficult to decide which nonhumans fall below this threshold, and there would undoubtedly be much overlap be- tween some normal nonhumans (specifically, those best suited to serve as models for human biology) and some unfortunate humans. Although Kantianism prescribes no direct duties toward unfortunate humans, there is general agreement that normal individuals are indirectly obliged to protect them. For example, Regan47 considers the mentally handicapped (and nonhumans) to be "moral patients" rather than "moral agents," whose lesser moral status nevertheless grants them protection against mistreatment. Indeed, few Kantians are willing to deny moral worth entirely of individuals incapable of rational thought, including</page><page sequence="21">THE VIVISECTION DEBATE 179 nonhumans. Few people would suggest that there is no moral difference between kicking a rock and kicking a dog, for example. As such, Kantian moral theory often incorporates a measure of protection for nonhuman animals. Some philosophers, such as Regan,47 do so by ascribing limited rights directly to nonhumans. Others, such as St. Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant, argue that the mistreatment of nonhumans is unaccept- able because it increases the likelihood of mistreating humans.46 This latter argument is unconvincing, however, and ignores the legitimate claim to rights possessed by some nonhuman animals in cases where they continue to be afforded to unfortunate humans of equivalent ratio- nal and intellectual capabilities. Much like with utilitarianism, the application of Kantian moral theory to the vivisection debate suffers from inconsistencies and produces un- desirable and counter-intuitive results. As such, a reliance on a Kantian concept of "rights" is equally unlikely to grant victory to either side of the debate. Put simply, "the invocation of rights in moral/social debate today is a recipe for deadlock."45 Conclusions The strategies employed by both pro- and anti-vivisectionists over the past 150 years have been impotent to resolve the debate. Neither the citation of scientific statistics nor the implementation of traditional moral philosophy has settled this issue, and it is obvious that the continued invocation of such arguments will be similarly unproductive. This does not mean that the issue should become one of mere public opinion, how- ever. The exaggeration and misrepresentation of facts and the use of propaganda (and sometimes violence) induced by such a publicity con- test will never provide lasting resolution. The issue should instead be the focus of scholarly analysis, rational inquiry, and mutual consider- ation. As Mukerjee5 puts it, "Animal liberators need to accept that animal research is beneficial to humans. And animal researchers need to admit that if animals are close enough to humans that their bodies, brains and even psyches are good models for the human condition, then ethical di- lemmas surely arise in using them." Those interested in resolving these ethical dilemmas must move beyond the restrictive and inconsistent ap- plication of traditional moral theories of the past and approach the issue in new ways. It may in fact be that ethical issues such as this, which extend across species, cannot be resolved without a complete réévalua- tion of mankind's place in the natural world. The first step, of course, lies in acknowledging that such a reexamination is necessary. University ofGuelph</page><page sequence="22">1 80 PUBLIC AFFAIRS QUARTERLY NOTES 1. R. D.
