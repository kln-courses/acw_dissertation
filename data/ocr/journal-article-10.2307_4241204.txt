<plain_text><page sequence="1">456 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) Joan Gordon Hybridity, Heterotopia, and Mateship in China Mieville's Perdido Street Station Ever since its publication in 2000, China Mieville's Perdido Street Station has been a wonderful stimulus to the ongoing conversation of science fiction. Much of that conversation has centered around the novel's defiant unclassifiability. Is it fantasy? Horror? Science fiction? Steampunk? Weird fiction? Which is it?' All of them, of course, and in a complex conversation with one another. This article is itself part of the conversation, which is to say that, while my discussion will be extensive, it cannot be exhaustive, and it will suggest many further paths for the conversation to take. First, I plan to consider the ways in which Perdido Street Station exhibits its hybridity, by torturing the biological model and connecting notions of hybridity to those of the grotesque. Then I will consider how Perdido Street Station can be considered a heterotopia, starting from Foucault's usage and extending it a little bit. Finally, I want to see how its ideas of hybridity and heterotopia develop the friendly networks of the novel-its exploration of mateship. Thus, hybridity, heterotopia, and mateship-or farming, Foucault, and friends, as Mieville suggested (personal correspondence). These three paths form an interconnected and dynamic network, and this essay forms an exploration meant to be generative rather than complete. China Mieville's sprawling novel is difficult to summarize, but at its core is the city New Crobuzon, an urban Gormenghast in which Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin searches for a mechanism to help a crippled bird-man fly; searches for his lover, Lin, an artist with a human body and the head of a scarab beetle, who is in thrall to a monstrously multiple crime lord, Mr. Motley; and searches for the hideous slake-moths who are sucking the sentience from the city. The search takes him into vast garbage dumps, through underground tunnel systems, from one teeming section of the vast city to another, to the city's core, the evocatively named Perdido Street Station. Success depends upon the banding together and mutual aid of Grimnebulin's network of friends and associates as they pit themselves against not only the moths, but also the city's corrupt and brutal criminals and its equally corrupt and brutal government forces. The characters, the city in which they live, the novel itself, are all hybrid forms. The many spaces they occupy form heterotopian mirrors for their world. Hybridity. I take my understanding of hybridity from Brian Stross's article "The Hybrid Metaphor: From Biology to Metaphor." There, he succinctly defmes the biological term and then identifies its metaphorical use: In Latin the hibrida was the offspring of a (female) domestic sow and a (male) wild boar. The semantic range of the word hybrid has expanded in more recent times to include the offspring of a mating by any two unlike animals or plants. The cultural hybrid is a metaphorical broadening of this biological definition. It</page><page sequence="2">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 457 can be a person who represents the blending of traits from diverse cultures and traditions, or even more broadly it can be a culture, or element of culture, derived from unlike sources; that is, something heterogeneous in origin or composition. (1) Just as postmodern writers and literary theorists have appropriated chaos theory for their own fiendish metaphorical ends, to the disgust of contemporary physicists, so have postcolonial writers and theorists kidnapped the term "hybrid" from its biological home and dragged it into the metaphorical muck.2 When I did a keyword search of the word "hybridity" on the MLA Index, it retrieved 227 titles, virtually all on postcolonial subjects. It may be that the biologists are disgusted too, but Stross's brief history of the word shows that, even in biology, its meaning has broadened, so perhaps they are more sanguine about the appropriation. Certainly, hybridity has proved to be as evocatively satisfying a metaphor as chaos theory. It is especially stimulating in the literatures of the fantastic, which have the particular freedom of literalizing metaphor. Writers from Delany to LeGuin to Attebery to Landon, in their explorations of science fiction, discuss this freedom, illustrating it with now- famous examples such as Delany's "Her world exploded," and LeGuin's "He was absorbed in the landscape."3 Mieville lives in a metaphorically hybrid London and most of us reading this article are metaphorically hybrid people, but Perdido Street Station literalizes the metaphor in its fantastically chimeric people and in its fantastically accreted city. I want to look at how Mieville extends the metaphor of the biological model of hybridity, first in the character of Lin, the scarab-woman; next in the constructed hybrids or Remades; then in the city of New Crobuzon; and finally, in the form of the novel itself. Stross discusses several biological concepts and their adaption to cultural models. There is, in the formation of hybrids, a hybridity cycle moving from hybrid to "purebred" to hybrid again. First, a hybrid is born, created from two sufficiently unlike parents. Then, if that hybrid is recognized as a new thing, it may be named, giving the new form a legitimacy and "a kind of purity" (7). Through inbreeding or self-pollination of similar hybrids, it is refined to a homogeneity which may now be considered purebred. And then the cycle can begin again. In cultural terms, a hybrid is formed through social interaction, be it war, or education, or friendship. The resulting heterogeneity is not genetic heterozygosity, but cultural variability and variety, permitting greater adaptability to the environment (2). Thus, "cultural hybridization implies a fertile and creative response to environmental pressures and opportunities" (6): this is hybrid vigor. As one would expect, significant differences exist between the biological and the cultural models. There are no limits in the number of traits passed along in cultural hybridization: the cultural hybrid is not limited to two "parents," two alternatives on a gene, or some limited number on a chromosome, but is "cross- pollinated" by an unlimited number of environmental, social, and cultural sources. The changes occur much more quickly than in the biological model: a</page><page sequence="3">458 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) month abroad can do the trick culturally-think Lamarckian rather than Darwinian evolution at work. In the biological model, a hybrid bred like-to-like will gradually lose its hybrid vigor over the generations until it reaches the level of the original "purebred" parents, while such loss of vigor is by no means inevitable in the cultural model (3). The hybridity cycle, the process of naming a hybrid into legitimacy, hybrid vigor, and the adaptability of a heterogeneous product, all are illustrated with significant metaphorical force in the character of Lin. Lin's body is a hybrid form-part human and part insect. But in the world of New Crobuzon, that heterogeneous form has stabilized into a "purebred," homogeneous, named species, the khepri. The anthropomorphic nature of the khepri body, rumors of a "Fractured Land" (373), the tremendous range of humanoid bodies in this world, all suggest that the khepri, and many other species, once hybrid, are now, through generations of breeding like-to-like, "purebred." Lin's coupling with the human Isaac suggests new hybrid forms to come. Here, in terms of the novel's speculation, is a biological model of the hybridity cycle. Of course, this is all literalized metaphor, but the novel broadens the conceit further. The khepri of New Crobuzon have a traditional form of art-heroic, communally-produced statuary made from shaped and hardened glandular secretions. Lin uses the traditional materials in untraditional ways for "interesting, unsettling ends" (39), inspired by her break with the traditional khepri culture and her exposure to other artists from other cultural enclaves. This new art might represent the hybrid vigor of cultural cross-pollination. The khepri had been refugees from a mysterious Ravening but are now, generations later, "by an organic pressure just too gentle to be obvious, living in ghettos" (214). Here might be a parallel to the loss of hybrid vigor in the biological model. Lin, therefore, leaves that ghetto for a heterogeneous artists' enclave, expanding and changing with her cultural cross-pollination, adapting to new opportunities. In art and in social movement, we see metaphorical cultural transformations of the biological model, illustrating a cultural version of hybrid vigor. In a more complex manner, Mieville reiterates the model in the way his novel's protagonist Isaac sees Lin and, consequently, in the way the reader perceives her. Lin is transformed by Isaac's loving perception into someone not only grotesque, but also beautiful. Isaac finds her difference from him both repellent and attractive: "As he watched her, Isaac felt the familiar thrill of emotion: disgust immediately stamped out, pride at the stamping out, guilty desire" (10). The reader undergoes a similar range of emotions in the descriptions Mieville offers. First, the emphasis on her strangeness as a new thing, a hybrid: "Her headlegs quivered. She picked up half a tomato and gripped it in her mandibles. She lowered her hands while her inner mouthparts picked at the food her outer jaw held steady" (10): disgust. Then, the naming of the hybrid: "Isaac watched the huge iridescent scarab that was his lover's head devour her breakfast" (10): its stamping out. Finally, acceptance: "He traced the branching veins in her gently vibrating wings with his fimgers,</page><page sequence="4">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 459 watched the light that passed through them refract into mother-of-pearl shadows" (14): desire. In Isaac's "thrill of emotion" and in the reader's parallel experience, we see an echo of the first two stages of the hybridity cycle, from hybridity to "purity." In each meeting of the lovers, in each scene as the reader calls up the images of a woman's body surmounted by the head of a giant beetle, including all the little legs and mandibles, the cycle begins again. Isaac's "thrill of emotion" echoes not only the biological hybridity cycle but also the effect of the grotesque as discussed in Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr.'s article "On the Grotesque in Science Fiction." He describes the grotesque as "a projection of fascinated repulsion/attraction out into objects that consciousness cannot accommodate, because the object disturbs the sense of rational, natural categorization" (71). Lin inspires both repulsion and attraction. "The grotesque," Csicsery-Ronay goes on to argue, is "the dominant sensibility of modernism-and of postmodernism as well, with one qualification. In romantic and modernist sensibilities, contrasts between ideal forms and anomalous deviations were considered to be monstrous. For the postmodern they are norms" (72). Lin exemplifies the postmodern version. A member of an established community in a wider society of equally hybridized species, her position in New Crobuzon is unremarkable: she has been named into a "pure" normativity. Isaac's acceptance further normalizes her hybrid and grotesque position. Meta-textually, when Mieville describes her without adjectival recoil, this further advances the idea of a normative grotesque. Such normalizing creates a tension which Csicsery-Ronay explores as a gap, citing Jeffrey Galt Hapham's 1991 book On the Grotesque: "Hapham conceives of the grotesque in terms of the interval.... [T]he interval is a gap shared by the object and the perceiver"(77). For Isaac, the gap is expressed in the imaginative "stamping out." For the reader that gap comes between Mieville's normalizing, even beautifying, descriptions of the grotesque and our processing of what the descriptions encompass. I wish now to consider a group of characters in Perdido Street Station called Remades. They are not in any way genetic hybrids, having been formed by the violent grafting of unlikely components onto living flesh, often as punishment for crimes. Rather, they are hybrid forms in the way that Donna Haraway's cyborgs are hybrid, metaphorically another step away from the biological model.4 If, as Csicsery-Ronay says, the grotesque refers to "the strange conflation of disparate elements not found in nature" (71), the Remades are perfect illustrations of how a hybrid form can be grotesque. Let me illustrate with a single memorable example, though it is by no means the most horrible: "Some woman ... killed her baby.... She's sitting in court, her eyes just ... damn well empty ... she can't believe what's happened, she just keeps moaning her baby's name, and the Magister sentences her. Prison, of course, ten years I think, but it was the Remaking that I remember. "Her baby's arms are going to be grafted to her face. 'So she doesn't forget what she did,' he says." (93)</page><page sequence="5">460 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) The punishment is designed to fit the crime in a vile and symbolic way. The novel contains other examples as well: a man whose mouth is sealed, another who has wings "shoved ruthlessly into the skin" (91), and so on. I have already spoken of how Lin's hybrid form incites the effect of the grotesque. Like Lin, who is herself certainly grotesque, the Remades conflate disparate elements, but there are no loving eyes to normalize or name them into purity as there are for Lin. Nor are there enough of any one of these hybrid forms to produce any homogeneous group, as Lin has the khepri. Their sentence is, instead, to be alone of their kind, hybrid freaks like Frankenstein's creature. Perhaps the Remades represent the next stage of what Foucault calls "the history of the body" for discipline and punishment (Discipline 25). No more "the cellular prison, with its regular chronologies, forced labor, its authorities of surveillance and registration, its experts in normality," which Foucault sees as "the modem instrument of penality" (Discipline 228). Certainly, the idea of hybrid punishment is not all that far-fetched. Remember the joke that made its rounds soon after the U.S. began bombarding Afghanistan. Did you hear they captured bin Laden? Yeah, they put him through a sex-change operation and dropped him back in Afghanistan. Apparently, the idea of forming a surgical hybrid as a punishment is not unthinkable at all. However, I'm not totally convinced that hybridization marks a new episteme. After all, a low-tech version of genetic hybrid discipline and punishment has been in continuous practice for as long as we have records-that is, of course, the rape of defeated women by their conquerors, intended not only to humiliate but also to produce hybrids of the conquerors. Still, there is no doubt that, in Mieville's hybrid vision, even punishment fits the scheme. Not all Remades, however, are produced through discipline by the state. Some are commercial ventures, broadening the hybridity metaphor still further, to literalize the metaphor of woman as sex object: "David paced past naked bodies covered in breasts, like plump scales; monstrous crablike torsos with nubile girlish legs at both ends; a woman who gazed at him with intelligent eyes above a second vulva" (342). These women (and men and boys as well) were "Remade by the punishment factories according to strange carnal designs and sold to pimps and madams. It was a profitable sideline run by the bio- thaumaturges of the state" (342). It is, surely, punishment, but the intent is commercial-commodification of the body beyond the present level of tinkering to a truly grotesque "conflation of disparate elements not found in nature" (Csicsery-Ronay 71): each alone, unnamed, hybridized for adaptability only to its commodification. The city itself is a hybrid, built among the bones of some vast long-dead creature, a collection of neighborhoods distinguished by strange architectures, full of immigrants, a bit like a very far-future London, but not quite: a hyperbolic metaphor for the hybrid nature of the great cities of the contem- porary world. The city, though it is a constructed and unique hybrid like the Remades, is, nevertheless, a thriving, constantly adaptive example of hybrid vigor, an even broader interpretation of the cultural hybrid metaphor. New</page><page sequence="6">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 461 Crobuzon's connoisseur of hybridity is a particularly complex Remade, its crime boss, the aptly named Mr. Motley. Here is his description of the city: Perched where two rivers strive to become the sea, where mountains become a plateau ... New Crobuzon's architecture moves from the industrial to the residential to the opulent to the slum to the underground to the airborne to the modern to the ancient to the colourful to the drab to the fecund to the barren. (41) He describes a space truly heterogeneous, "cross-bred," as Lin earlier calls a single neighborhood (31). Every sector of the city-from the Griss Twist Dump, home of the Construct Council, itself a little city comprising thousands of robotic constructs; to the Veruline Hospital; to Spit Hearth and Petty Coil; to Perdido Street Station-is a hybrid of "disparate elements," "derived from unlike sources." And the city morphs from these hybridized sectors into a constantly shifting, highly adaptive, heterogeneous topos: a heterotopia. It is a heterotopia in the Foucauldian sense, too, but that will be the subject of the next section of this essay. The city's hybridity is as central to the novel as Perdido Street Station is to the city of New Crobuzon. Again, I turn to Mr. Motley, who theorizes about the hybrid nature of New Crobuzon: "This is what makes the world.... Transition. The point where one thing becomes another. It is what makes you, the city, the world, what they are. And that is the theme I'm interested in. The zone where the disparate becomes part of the whole. The hybrid zone" (41). Mieville's city is a hybrid zone in which each character, each neighborhood, the massive conurbation itself, is in transition, one thing becoming another, repeating the hybridity cycle like wheels within wheels, like the crisis engine Isaac pursues in his quest to give the bird-man flight.5 For Mieville, too, the theme is transition, and he creates his own vast hybrid zone, heterogeneous in its influences and in its form. The novel, like Mr. Motley, is a "totality" (115) made up intentionally of "disparate elements." And Mieville is like Isaac in a further way. Isaac describes himself as "not a chymist, or a biologist, or a thaumaturge," but as "the main station for all schools of thought. Like Perdido Street Station.... All the trainlines meet there ...; everything has to pass through it" (50). Seemingly, everything Mieville has been interested in has entered the metaphorical gene pool of his novel-all the genetic lines meet in Perdido Street Station. In my ongoing email interview with Mieville (printed elsewhere in this issue), he has given an indication of the complexity of his novel's lineage, briefly referring to British children's TV in the 1970s and 1980s and to sf movies, particularly The Matrix (1999), the Alien "franchise," John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness (1987), and "the aesthetic" of the Quay brothers and Jan Svankmajer. As intensely visual as Perdido Street Station is, it's no wonder that Mieville lists as influences surrealists such as Max Ernst and Hans Bellmer; contemporary artists such as Basquiat; printmakers including Piranesi and Escher, Peake and Tenniell; and comix artists Chris Ware, Burne Hogarth, and Ken Reid, among others. Of course, there are many literary influences and that list is so long that I'll just mention a very few that</page><page sequence="7">462 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) do not seem evident until he brings them up-Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre (1847) and Charlotte Perkin Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper" (1892)-and a few specific works of genre fiction such as Brian Aldiss's Malacia Tapestry (1976) and Tim Powers's Anubis Gates (1983). My own notes to the book list Charles Dickens, Gene Wolfe, Mervyn Peake, H.P. Lovecraft, the movie Brazil (1984), and Wagner's Ring cycle, though decidedly not The Lord of the Rings, from which Mieville firmly distances himself. "I kind of made a checklist: Tolkien is rural and bucolic, so let's make it urban and shitty; Tolkien is feudalism lite, so let's make it capitalism dark, and you go on like that" (Brown 5). But he pays particular homage to two other influences: "I sometimes feel as if, formally, my stuff is a cross between Viriconium [by M. John Harrison] and D&amp;D [Dungeons and Dragons, the role-playing game]" (Gordon 357). In both cases, the influence is on his very rich world-building. Of role-playing games, he says: There were two things about them that particularly influenced me. One was the mania for cataloguing the fantastic.... [Olne of the main spurs to write a secondary-world fantasy was to invent a bunch of monsters.... The other, more nebulous but very strong influence of RPGs was the weird fetish for systemisation.... There's something superheroically banalifying about that approach to the fantastic. On one level it misses the point entirely, but I must admit it appeals to me in its application of some weirdly misplaced rigor onto the fantastic: it's a kind of exaggeratedly precise approach to secondary world creation. (Gordon 356-57) Returning to the language of the biological model, the offspring of two such unlike parents-the highly regarded New Wave sf author and the role-playing game most closely associated with nerdy youth-is a literary hybrid. Perdido Street Station has most certainly been recognized as a new thing, and critics have been eager to name it, though the author resists such urges: "There's been a (to my mind rather scholastic and sterile) debate about whether Perdido Street Station is sf or fantasy (or even horror-it made the long-list for the Stoker)" (Gordon 359). However much he resists the pull toward the purebred, he nevertheless does name his work "Weird Fiction, in that it's self- consciously at the intersection" (Gordon 359). Since there is plenty of argument about what weird fiction is, he has given this hybrid an unstable, liminal sort of name. In the very stimulating essay which opens Veronica Hollinger's and my collection Edging Into the Future (2002), Gary K. Wolfe notes the instability of fantastic genre fiction, seeing its "genre markers" as "radically unstable" and containing "within themselves the seeds of their own dissolution, of a nascent set of postmodern rhetorical modes that would ... begin to supplant ... the notion of genre itself" (15). In seeing his work as "self-consciously at the intersection," Mieville has planted those seeds of dissolution Wolfe explores in his essay. To return to Csicsery-Ronay's discussion of the grotesque, Mieville's genre- splicing "disturbs the sense of rational, natural categorization" (71), inspiring both repulsion as a horror novel with its mind-sucking slake-moths and</page><page sequence="8">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 463 attraction as a romance with Lin as the damsel in distress. The novel, a Mr. Motley of influences and genres, fits Csicsery-Ronay's characterization of the grotesque as a "conflation of disparate elements" (71), with its long list of cultural and generic progenitors. And, if I might conflate his observations on the grotesque with Wolfe's on genre, these disparate elements "begin to supplant ... the notion of genre itself" (Wolfe 15). Mieville joins in the project Wolfe outlines: The writers who contribute to the evaporation of genre, who destabilize it by undermining our expectations and appropriating materials at will, their fiction shaped by individual vision rather than the conventions of fictive traditions, are the same writers who continually revitalize genre: a healthy genre, a healthy literature, is one at risk, whose boundaries grow uncertain and whose foundations get wobbly. (27) Take away the "r" and we are talking about genes, not genres, and this sounds very much like hybrid vigor. Mieville's conflation of genres and influences, his vision of hybrid beings in a hybrid world, sets up a hybridity cycle which destabilizes the novel's genrefication the instant it is named. Many other aspects of this novel, from its politics to its use of language, can also be understood as hybrid, as can many other books and as can we, our communities, and our ideas as well. Perdido Street Station forms what Foucault calls a countersite where "all the other sites that can be found within the culture [or, I might add, within the book] are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted" ("Of Other Spaces" 24): that's how Foucault describes heterotopia. And that's the situation of this essay, of many works of sf, and of most current critical theories as well: "all other sites ... are ... represented." Heterotopia. Having discussed the hybridity of Perdido Street Station both metatextually and fictionally, I now want to look at Foucault's richly generative word, heterotopia. It was evocative before Foucault, and independently of him, as well as generating meaning descendent from his use. Before applying the word to the book, I will make a quick survey of those meanings. If we go back to the Greek, we fmd that "hetero" means the other (of two), different, the opposite of "homo." Topia comes from the word for place-so we have the other place, a different place, or, if it is the opposite of "homo," a varied or multifarious place. A multifarious place-particularly evocative of New Crobuzon with its many distinctive neighborhoods and species; a place made up of other places or of many elements, a hybrid place, as I have discussed above. But if it is the other of two places, perhaps one place is in opposition to the other place, forming a dialectic, a feedback mechanism between one and the other that generates the next place, a hybrid that becomes the generator of a new cycle of dialectics. My Handbook to Literature reminds me that "In classical literature, dialectics refers to the tradition of continuing debate or discussion of eternally unresolved issues" (Harmon 148), the give and take of engaged conversation among mates and the matter of novels. It also references, of course, thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, Hegel, and Marx, and</page><page sequence="9">464 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) we are reminded that Mieville is an editor of the Marxist journal Historical Materialism. Independent of Foucault's meaning is the medical definition of heterotopia, "'ectopic grey matter,' collections of normal neurones in an abnormal location, outside the cortex.... Heterotopia almost always produces seizure disorders" ("Heterotopia"). Seizure disorders, displaced brain cells-again evocative, here of the brain-sucking slake-moths of Perdido Street Station. Seemingly spawned from Foucault's use of heterotopia are new meanings not overt in his defining essay "Of Other Spaces" (1986): the virtual city of an Internet website (City of News 2003: &lt;http://caad.arch.ethz.ch/-hoeger/www/ projects/cityofnews/heterotopia.htm &gt; ) and "the variety of utopias ... imagined by postmodernity" in Tobin Siebers's Heterotopia: Postmodern Utopia and the Body Politic (from the online blurb 2003: &lt;http://www.deathstar.org/groups/ umpress/Titles/siebers.html&gt;). These meanings are less evocative for my purposes, since every novel creates a virtual place; since New Crobuzon, although it may be many things, is not a utopia, in the sense of a better place; and since Foucault insists upon heterotopias as "real" spaces. More evocative is Samuel R. Delany's knowing use of the term in Trouble on Triton (1976/ 1996), where he plays with utopian expectations and quotes from the preface to Foucault's The Order of Things (1966), with its discussion of how heterotopias "dissolve our myths and sterilize the lyricism of our sentences" (Foucault, qtd. Delany 292). To this last meaning I will return. But I must resist most of these spawning definitions, each capable of generating another essay, another branch of the ongoing conversation. Although generative unruliness is quite appropriate to the spirit of Perdido Street Station, to notions of hybridity and heterotopia, and to this discussion of both, I shall resist that unruliness here, and leave others to follow the rhizomatic conversation I have broadly mapped. Instead, I shall narrow my own focus to Foucault's definition of heterotopia in "Of Other Spaces" (delivered as a lecture 1966, first published 1984, appearing in English 1986), and, rather differently, in The Order of Things (1966, 1970), which are generative enough, and use it only in exploring two heterotopian sites in the novel, the Griss Twist Dump where the Construct Council resides, and Perdido Street Station itself, "the city's focal point, where all the lines converge" (584). First, I want to consider Foucault's definition in "Of Other Spaces," which I will apply to the Griss Twist Dump, of heterotopias as counter-sites. He differentiates them from utopias, which "are sites with no real place" (24). Thus, he calls a heterotopia an "effectively enacted utopia," using "utopia" to mean "no place" rather than "a better place," as there is no implication of the heterotopia as a better "counter-site." He goes on to list six principles of heterotopias. First, all societies have heterotopias, including those of crisis, "privileged or sacred or forbidden places" where transformative experiences take place (24), and of deviation, "in which individuals whose behavior is deviant in relation to the required mean or norm are placed" (25). Second, society can vary the functions of its heterotopias, and they do have social functions. Third, heterotopias juxtapose multiple incompatible places. Fourth,</page><page sequence="10">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 465 they are linked to "slices in time" (26). Fifth, they open and close, in a system "that both isolates them and makes them penetrable" (26). Sixth, "they have a function in relation to all the space that remains" (27). Among his examples of heterotopias are prisons, cemeteries, gardens, libraries, motels, and colonies. A boat is a perfect example since it is, as he says, "a place without a place, that exists by itself, that is closed on itself and at the same time is given over to the infinity of the sea" (27).6 Because Foucault specifies that heterotopias are "real," I resist the impulse to see the novel itself as a heterotopian counter-site simultaneously mirroring our world and inverting it, though that is exactly what good fiction of any genre does. Instead, I want to examine how two sites described in the novel, "real" in terms of the world of the fiction, fit Foucault's definition. First, let us climb into the Griss Twist Dump, repository of the vast detritus of the vast city of New Crobuzon, a place whose contents represent the contents of the culture as a whole-its food, clothing, machinery, building materials, even its citizens-but cast off now and broken. The dump, then, mirrors its culture and inverts it-contains what the culture uses and uses up, acquires and then rejects, creates and then destroys. Sociologists and archaeologists use garbage cans and middens to learn about the cultures they are studying, and find them ripe sources. All societies have dumps-they might be considered deviation heterotopias, like prisons for things that deviate from the society's accepted norm. Griss Twist Dump contains the cast-off machines of New Crobuzon, machines that are piled in a chaotic heap but begin to exhibit that characteristic of chaotic systems that Prigogine described, order arising out of chaos. This is where the Construct Council resides, the synthesis of countless cast-off pieces. The amalgamation of discarded robotic machinery describes its own birth: I was born of random power and virus and chance. My first body lay here in the dump ... discarded because a programme had faltered. As my body lay decomposing the virus circulated in my engines and spontaneously I found thought. (456) Then it begins to build itself, linking parts together with cable, linking to other constructed intelligences. My cables and connected machines spread far into the rubbishland. Calculating engines at the other end of the tip are pieces of me. I am the repository of construct history. I am the data bank. I am the self-organized machine. (457)7 While the dump forms a deviation heterotopia for New Crobuzon, for the Construct, for those machines that join it, for those people who come to worship it, for all those cast off from the society, the dump becomes what Foucault calls a crisis heterotopia, a sacred place where members of society are transformed. Here, they are transformed into a vast, powerful, unitary intelligence. Foucault says that crisis heterotopias are disappearing and are being replaced by deviation heterotopias: he cites rest homes, psychiatric hospitals, and prisons, where we warehouse our "deviants." The Griss Twist Dump suggests</page><page sequence="11">466 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) the antithesis: as people are cast off from society, they form a counter-society, a counter-site of their own. To the society that casts its deviants aside, these institutions are deviation heterotopias. To the residents of rest homes and psychiatric hospitals and prisons, their isolation from society links them to others like themselves. No longer deviant in this counter-site, they undergo the transformative experience of the crisis. That is what has happened to the Construct Council in its hybridized, multifarious totality. Like Whitman, it contains multitudes. We might think of this movement between deviation and crisis heterotopias in terms of the formalized conversation of dialectics. Mieville's own view of dialectics,which emphasizes interaction and liminality within a totality, is therefore relevant: Dialectics are centrally important to me as it focuses on ... the blurred interstices, gray areas, hard cases-but as part of a social and historical totality.... The point of dialectics as about movement, dynamism, tendencies within an overall, comprehensible and total system is incredibly illuminating to me.... I try to avoid a sense of a static system. Modernity, history, is always- already-in-transition. That's what dialectics is about, to me. (Gordon 364) To return to the Construct Council: alone and inert, it is a pile of junk, but as it becomes dynamic, it forms a "social and historical totality." Linking with other machines, and with people as well, it is social, forming an interactive conversation. As a "repository of construct history," it is historical. Foucault's fourth principle of heterotopias becomes pertinent: they are "linked to slices in time." The Construct Council would be, according to Foucault, a heterotopia "of indefinitely accumulating slices of time" like a museum or library, "enclosing in one space all times, all epochs" (26). A further link: Isaac, the novel's protagonist, theorizes and discovers a kind of Theory of Everything called crisis energy. Here is how he describes it: "See, potential energy's all about placing something in a situation where it's about to change its state.... The transition from one state to another's affected by taking something-a social group, a piece of wood, a hex-to a place where its interactions with other forces make its own energy pull against its current state. "I'm talking about taking things to the point of crisis." (169) Isaac builds a "crisis engine" to harness this energy. Crisis energy, concerned with "blurred interstices" and dynamism, metaphorizes dialectics as Mieville describes it and the dialectic I sense between crisis and deviation heterotopias, as well as describing the process by which the Construct Council comes into being. Crisis energy is heterotopian energy, dialectical energy, dynamic energy. It is "always-already-in-transition," an interactive conversation among its components. It is time to move from the Dump to New Crobuzon's main railway station, Perdido Street Station. This too forms a heterotopic space. If I have let the Griss Twist Dump exemplify the principles of heterotopias delineated in "Of Other Spaces," I am going to let the station exemplify heterotopia as Foucault describes it in the preface to The Order of Things. There he stresses the liminal</page><page sequence="12">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 467 or diffuse nature of heterotopia, its ability, like the stories of Borges, "to disturb and threaten with collapse our age-old distinction between the Same and Others" (377). Heterotopias "are disturbing, probably because they secretly undermine language, because they make it impossible to name this and that" (379). The Station is the hub of all the city's main lines-all lines radiate from it, yet it "was not discrete. Its edges were permeable.... The architecture oozed out of its bounds" (616). The station rises in "chaotic majesty" above the surrounding neighborhood (615), defying categorization, collapsing "our age-old distinction between the Same and Others." The Station is a real place, but one impossible to name as one thing or another because of its permeable, oozy liminality. The oozy permeability which characterizes the station indicates its aptness as a metaphor for certain of the novel's characters, not only quite obviously the suitably named Mr. Motley, who reminds us that oozy permeability infuses the concept of hybridity as well, but also Isaac, who says, "I think of myself as the main station for all the schools of thought. Like Perdido Street Station." Unnameable in the sense of being uncategorizable, he describes himself as "not a chymist, or a biologist, or a thaumaturge.... I'm a dilettante ... a dabbler." Nevertheless, he, like the station, is "Unavoidable." As Isaac says, "All the trainlines meet there ...; everything has to pass through it. That's like me. That's my job. That's the kind of scientist I am" (50-51). Isaac, like Perdido Street Station (and Mr.Motley, and the Construct Council, and the Griss Twist Dump), is diffuse and permeable, but also central. Rather than undermining language, as Foucault claims, these unnameable and permeable sites focus the conversation. Its diffuse, motley, hybrid, chaotic nature is what makes the heterotopian space of Perdido Street Station the hub of the city, geographically and novelistically, since multiple plot lines also converge there in a climactic battle among slake-moths, criminal and government forces, a giant spider who straddles states of being, and Isaac and his mates. This centrality runs counter to a tempting argument made by Neil Easterbrook in his essay on heterotopia in works by Heinlein, Le Guin, and Delany. Easterbrook links their work to Deleuze and Guattari's idea of the rhizome. "The schema of a heterotopia," according to Easterbrook, "is the rhizome: a model of rhetorical, semiotic, intertextual, heterotropic space" (70). Like Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari list principles, in this case of rhizomatic systems. Some, "Principles of connection and heterogeneity" (7), and of multiplicity (8), resonate with the heterotopian spaces of Perdido Street Station. Crucial, however, to Deleuze and Guattari, and to Easterbrook's use of their work as he applies it to Delany's Triton, is the idea that it is "acentered, nonhierarchical, ... without a General and without an organizing memory or central automaton" (Deleuze and Guattari 21). If decentering is a crucial component of many heterotopias, then the centralization and hierarchy in Perdido Street Station run counter to that aspect of heterotopia. Mieville's words about dialectics describe the difference between decentered heterotopias and Perdido Street Station. In Mieville's novel, as in his interview, dialectics "focuses on ... the blurred interstices;" but the "connection and</page><page sequence="13">468 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) heterogeneity" (Deleuze and Guattari) of dialectics do not result in the decentered network of a rhizome in this novel. Instead, the liminal, interstitial spaces of Perdido Street Station are part of "an overall, comprehensible and total system" (Gordon 364 ). The two heterotopic spaces from Mieville's novel that I've explored here, the Griss Twist Dump and Perdido Street Station, manage to be heterogeneous, diffuse, liminal, interstitial, permeable, and chaotic, rhizomatic in many ways. These sites also form centers from which much radiates, and so are exfoliate rather than rhizomatic. All parts interact, influencing and changing one another; they are complex: dynamic yet totalized systems. The centered conversation of dialectics works in this novel much as crisis energy does for its protagonist-as a totalizing Theory of Everything that incorporates dynamic change. It may be that this dynamic change, allowing for sensitive dependency among the multifarious parts of the heterogeneous whole, saves totalizing from becoming totalitarian, bridging the gap between Modernism's totality and Postmodernism's diffusion. Mateship. I want to show how Mieville's vision of mateship bridges the gap between totalizing and totalitarianism.8 Mateship is an interactive conversation among its members: mutually helpful, concerned, and interested; to evoke physics metaphors, it suggests a complex feedback relationship. Friendship groups in the novel form another kind of hybridized entity, another kind of heterotopic space. One can think of several such groups in the novel: Isaac's group of "rogue scientists" sharing warehouse space, Lin's community of artists, the underground newspaper coterie. I shall use the group that Isaac forms in the culminating chapters of the novel to combat the slake-moths as my illustration of how all these ideas of hybridity and heterotopia come together, since this last group arises out of all those previously named ones. The novel's last three sections describe the first failed attempt to destroy the moths ("The Glasshouse" 509-67), the climactic success ("Crisis" 575-667), and its social aftermath ("Judgement" 684-701). In both the failed and the successful attempts, Isaac shows that, like his crisis engine, like Perdido Street Station, and like the Construct Council, he makes connections. He consolidates people from Lin's group of artists, the underground newspaper, and his own group of rogue scientists, as well as other anti-government/underground groups, to band together in the climactic battles. As some people die and others join the resistance, the individual make-up of the group shifts, but the sense of comradeship remains. Through persistence, ingenuity (both scientific and otherwise), bravery, cooperation, skill-from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs-they succeed in destroying all four of the monsters, while eluding government forces, the criminal forces of Mr. Motley, and the Construct Council.9 Crucial to destroying the moths is the connecting of a cable between the Construct Council at the Griss Twist Dump and the crisis engine far across the city at Perdido Street Station. Such a massive project requires massive cooperation. Much of it Isaac obtains from the Construct Council, whose motive is to set up a feedback loop with the crisis engine so as to gain unlimited power</page><page sequence="14">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 469 over the city's intelligences, artificial and organic. Isaac cautiously distances the crisis engine from the Construct Council, and installs a "circuit valve" (624) to block feedback. As this part of the denouement unfolds, the Construct Council is described as having an intelligence which is all consciousness and calculation. To lay the cable, to protect the crisis engine at Perdido Street Station, and to lure the slake-moths to the crisis engine, Isaac needs people. The Construct Council supplies most of the manual labor for laying cable, people (human and otherwise) who have become his worshippers, his "bloodlife congregation" (598). In addition, Isaac employs a mercenary who had been part of the earlier, failed battle, an amphibious vodyanoi woman named Pengefmchess who is uniquely suited to lay cable under the river separating the two sites. The raptor- bird-like garuda man Yagharek, whom Isaac has been attempting to help regain flight by means of the crisis engine, also helps out of a sense of loyalty to Isaac. Derkhan Blueday, a human artist friend of Lin's, is also the art critic for an anti-government underground newspaper. She helps out of loyalty to Lin and to the editor of the newspaper who had been tortured and destroyed by government forces. Unsolicited by Isaac, the shadowy urban Robin Hood figure known as Jack Half-a-Prayer, a Remade (now, as a resister, a fReemade), joins their small force. More problematically, because it is gainst his will, Isaac and Derkhan use Andrej Shelbornek, a dying man snatched from a hospital, as bait for the slake-moths. As people (though not necessarily entirely or even partially human), they all share a "dialectical unity of consciousness and subconsciousness.... The interaction of levels of consciousness into an unstable and permanently self-renewing whole" (631-32). To complete the team, Isaac requests and receives the help of the Weaver, a giant spider, whose motives remain unknown and unknowable. He works alone and "thought in a continuous incomprehensible stream of awareness. There were no layers to the Weaver's mind.... dreams and consciousness were one" (630). Let me emphasize several points of the above description relevant to tying together the ideas of hybridity and heterotopia explored in this article. First, I have noted that Isaac's group includes three subsets: a being that is all consciousness and organization, the Construct Council; a being that does not separate consciousness from the unconscious, the Weaver; and beings that mediate between the two states in a "dialectic unity," people. Second, I have noted the heterogeneity of the members of Isaac's group-four sentient species and a range of bodily states from the artificial through the cyborg to the organic-which nevertheless form a unified collective capable of action. Third, I have noted the recurrence of connections-social, mechanical, political-among individuals and groups. The three subsets suggest a broad outline of social states: the Weaver, without mediation between states of consciousness, is all alone; the Construct Council, all consciousness, forms a regime with itself as the head; people, with a dialectic relationship, an interactive conversation, between conscious and unconscious, form friendship communities. The Weaver's thinking is unmediated, "no ego to control the lower functions, no animal cortex to keep</page><page sequence="15">470 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) the mind grounded ... no mental clearout of accrued garbage bespeaking an orderly consciousness ... without organizing principle, without substratum" (630). Without any mediation between conscious and unconscious, it is isolated because to speak to him "was like a dialogue with the sleeping or the mad" (578). With no dialectic between its own states of consciousness, a conversation between itself and others is "difficult, exhausting," although Isaac finds "it could be done" (578). Communication would be "difficult" at best; common concern and interaction, real dialectical exchange, perhaps impossible. Because its thinking is completely idiosyncratic, the Weaver is socially isolated: community, the feedback of interaction, the dialectic of friendship, is impossible. The Construct Council's thinking is "in extreme contrast to [the Weaver's] anarchic viral flurry, ... processed information without the complication of arcane desires or passion, .... thought without subconscious" (631). Communication with the Construct Council is not difficult, but that communication is only in one direction, for it to gather information and power, not to exchange: it is not interactive. Again, but for different reasons, concern, interaction, and feedback are impossible. Where the Weaver is necessarily alone, the Construct Council requires others, but not to form a community, a dialectic of friendship; instead, the Construct Council processes only monologues and commands, its community a "bloodlife congregation" designed only to serve it. It has only "a will to existence and aggrandizement, ... infinitely, incidentally cruel" (631). In fact, feedback, Isaac believes, would only result in the Construct Council's usurpation of the crisis engine for its own "aggrandizement" and that is why he installs the "circuit-valve." People-human, khepri, vodyanoi, or garuda-in contradistinction to the Weaver's blurring of conscious with unconscious, and the Construct Council's lack of unconscious, possess "a constantly convulsing dialectical unity of consciousness and subconsciousness" (631). Containing dialectical unity within, people in the novel are then capable of constructing dialectical unity among their members, forging the dialectic of friendship, the feedback of interaction, community, conversation. This is how Isaac and his mates destroy the slake- moths, where other groups-the Construct Council and its congregation, the government and crime factions-forged only to amass power, cannot. Now I want to link mateship to the ideas of hybridity discussed earlier by considering the heterogeneity of Isaac's mates as they form a unified collective. A group of friends joins unlike members into a new thing, a cultural hybrid. In the case of Isaac's group, Derkhan and Isaac are human; Lin, now incapacitated by both Mr. Motley and the slake-moths but still part of the group, is khepri; Yagharek, who will be rejected because of his earlier sins, is a garuda; Pengefimchess, on the fringes but still with an important role, a vodyanoi. Together, however, they are "his comrades" (577), as Isaac sees them. Together, they can contribute separate skills, perspectives, and motives, their dialectic mateship cross-pollinating and resulting in the hybrid vigor of their group.</page><page sequence="16">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 471 A small incident between Derkhan and Pengefmchess illustrates how these two unlike species, brought together by circumstances, form a new thing, a hybrid, that is then named into the purity and legitimacy of which I spoke earlier in describing the hybrid relationship between Isaac and Lin as lovers. Pengefinchess, after laying the cable under the river, turns back to wave to Derkhan in a "curt farewell, and she responded more fulsomely" (603), as if that wave began the process of naming their friendship into existence. Before the laying of the cable, the two women had not known each other, and Pengefmchess had begun her participation as a mercenary. Now, seeing the vodyanoi leave, Derkhan feels "a faint lack" and realizes that "circumstances had made them comrades" (604). For her part, Pengefmchess "wished Derkhan and the others luck. They had been companions, though very briefly" (606). They have named themselves into comrades, companions, mates, "though very briefly" in this case. Yagharek represents another illustrative case. He had been maimed, stripped of his wings, and exiled as punishment for violating his culture's highest ethic, that of choice, by violating the choice of a woman and raping her. "Rape" is Isaac's term for the crime, based on his culture and his response to Lin's brutal treatment; it is not accurate to garuda understanding. As the garuda who explains the crime to Isaac explains, "We must not take the choice of another being. What is community but a means to ... for all we individuals to have ... our choices" (692; ellipses and italics in original). In asking Isaac to provide him with the means to fly again, he continued to violate his own society's idea of community by seeking to escape from the punishment for an act reprehensible in his own eyes and, once Isaac understands the situation, in Isaac's as well. He nevertheless joined with Isaac and the others to destroy the slake-moths and, by doing so, felt a regenerative mateship with them, a return to community. When Isaac decides to end the relationship with Yagharek, once the battle is over, and once Isaac has learned of Yagharek's past, both Yagharek and Derkhan perceive Isaac's rejection as a betrayal. Derkhan says, "he's your friend. Isn't he? We can't just ... can we just leave him ...?" (699; ellipses in original). Yagharek describes it as a "brutal betrayal.... What a breach of faith, what cruelty" (704). Isaac seeks here to unname the hybrid, to deny its legitimacy as a new thing, and Yagharek goes on to despise and reject hybridity. When Jack Half-a-Prayer invites Yagharek to join him, the garuda rejects the offer to "share his bastard liminal life" (709). Instead, ripping out further signs of his non-human body, Yagharek describes himself as "not bird or garuda, not miserable crossbreed," but "a man" (710). These are, in fact, the last words of the novel. Like the Weaver, Yagharek is, at the end, alone. Unlike the spider, Yagharek chooses solitude, but also unlike the spider, he longs for mateship. Because Isaac had denied mateship to him, Yagharek rejects the hybridity of mateship symbolized by his hybrid man/bird form and offered by the hybrid fReemade Jack Half-a- Prayer. I do not, however, believe that Yagharek's words are representative of the main energy of the novel. He has been betrayed by Isaac's morally troublesome rejection, and his own attempt to subvert garuda justice is equally troublesome,</page><page sequence="17">472 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) so his judgement is clouded. In spite of Yagharek's condemnation of hybridity as "bastard" and "miserable," and even though the only functioning members of Isaac's group still together by novel's end are the two humans, Isaac and Derkhan, the weight of the rest of the novel's length, of its images, of its own hybrid form, point to a celebration of hybridity. We last see Isaac and Derkhan walking away together, supporting the now-fragile Lin, their hybrid community diminished but still intact. I wish to turn now to the heterotopian nature of mateship. Friendship groups in the novel create their own heterotopian spaces. I argued earlier for the dialectical relationship between the heterotopia and the larger world it mirrors. Certainly that is true of the friendship groups in Perdido Street Station. It is true, also, that dialectics is vital within these groups for them to function as friendly networks. Friendship, I believe, transforms deviation heterotopias into crisis heterotopias because the dynamism of dialectical feedback keeps the totality of the group from becoming totalitarian. These are the points I want to develop now, again using for illustration the group formed to kill the slake- moths in the closing sections of the novel. The last group of friends-Isaac, Derkhan, and Lin; Yagharek, Pengefmchess, Jack Half-a-Prayer, and, most troublingly, Andrej, the dying man they use-form, as Foucault defines heterotopia, "something like counter- sites ... in which the real sites ... are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted" ("Of Other Spaces" 24). It has, for instance, the hierarchies which arise in any tribe, with Isaac, Derkhan, and Lin at the center of activity and organization, and then the remaining characters I have named above ever farther away in terms of influence, intimacy, and dialectical exchange.'0 Isaac continues to organize plans, with Derkhan refining them. Lin, though now severely disabled, remains emotionally influential on the other two; they go off together, comrades, at the conclusion. Yagharek joins the group, and identifies himself as friend, closely interactive with them, until repelled from the cell because of his previous sins. Pengefmchess and Jack Half-a-Prayer are fellow travelers, sympathizing, helping, and identifying with the group without forming a lasting commitment to it. Andrej is a tool of the party, exemplifying quite vividly the moral difficulties of the end justifying the means. These concentric rings of relationship characterize and comment on society at every level. What indicates influence within the group is the feedback among its members: the more engaged the conversational dialectic, the more closely attached they are. Again, that is reflected in the concentric circles of people in this group. With no input of his own, Andrej is fmally expendable; by denying friendship (refusing any further conversation) to Yagharek, Isaac can expel Yagharek; Pengefinchess and Jack Half-a-Prayer choose to keep the exchange to a minimum. The core cell keeps its conversation going. Conversation, the dialectic of friendship, both indicates and determines that the group is a privileged site for its members, where transformative experiences take place-a crisis heterotopia, even if it may be, for the larger world which the heterotopian group reflects, a site "in which individuals whose behavior is deviant in relation to the required mean or norm are placed," that is, a deviation</page><page sequence="18">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 473 heterotopia (Foucault, "Of Other Spaces" 25). Yagharek's struggle to become a part of the group, his expulsion from it, and his reaction to that expulsion, demonstrate this movement between crisis and deviation heterotopia. Having refused to conform to his own society's norms of personal choice by violating the choice of another, he is stripped of his normative appearance-his wings are brutally removed-rather than placed in a prison, one of Foucault's examples of a deviation heterotopia. Instead, he leaves his own society, comes to New Crobuzon, and seeks out Isaac to restore his own normativity. By interacting with Isaac and his friends, he becomes a part of their group, and this is transformative for him-he learns to engage in a dialectic, not only to take according to his needs, but also to give according to his abilities. Their group is, for him, a crisis heterotopia. He does not, however, regain his wings or otherwise attain normality. Instead, expelled from what has become his crisis heterotopia, he rejects Jack Half-a-Prayer's invitation and attempts to remove all forms of hybrid deviation from his body. To refer again to Csicsery-Ronay's discussion of the grotesque, it may be that, for Yagharek, having been rejected however understandably by his own people, and again by Isaac's group, he finds "contrasts between ideal forms and anomalous deviations ... to be monstrous," whereas for Isaac and his group, and for Mieville, "they are norms" (Csiscery- Ronay 72). Yagharek, by Csicsery-Ronay's distinction of the grotesque, is a modernist struggling for pure normality in a postmodern hybrid world where deviation is the norm. In Foucauldian terms, a modernist's deviation heterotopia becomes, for the postmodernist, a crisis heterotopia that transforms the grotesque into a norm. In a deviation heterotopia, it seems, the contrast "between ideal forms and anomalous deviations" must allow no interaction, no feedback-it exists in order to separate the abnormal or grotesque from the normal. A crisis heterotopia exists not to separate but to join the ideal with the deviant-that is the transformation that takes place. The mateship bonds of Perdido Street Station provide the interaction for that transformation. The group of friends forms a transformative place, this example shows, only so long as a conversation continues. For Yagharek, and for Andrej who never was a part of the conversation, it does not serve that purpose. For one, summarily dismissed, and for the other, taken against his will, it is more of a totalitarian regime, with all the power, all the communication, going in one direction. Early on I suggested that dialectics, allowing for feedback among members of a group, could keep the totalizing nature of the group from becoming totalitarian. Here, it becomes evident that when the dialectic stops, totalitarianism can begin, highlighting the vital importance of interaction in the novel's vision. Let me return to Mieville's statement about dialectics as "centrally important ... as part of a social and historical totality" (Gordon 364, his italics). We have seen how easily the totalizing bond of mateship can move to a totalitarian rejection or exploitation of individuals without the "movement, dynamism" (Gordon 364, his italics) of dialectical feedback. But we have also seen how important that mateship bond can be. Without it, Isaac and his mates would have failed in their efforts to rid the city of the moths, of course. Without it,</page><page sequence="19">474 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 30 (2003) Lin would not survive. Without it, Isaac and Derkhan would be as bereft as Yagharek. But, as I conclude, I want to move beyond these particulars to our world, the world that the novel reflects upon so powerfully. In our world, we too seek connections, through friendship, and through other, vaster networks. Indeed, as illustrated by Perdido Street Station, and as illustrated by this article, we see connections, networks, everywhere. This is evidenced by the metaphors we use-of hybridity, of heterotopias, of mateship, of conversation, of Theories of Everything. All are metaphors of connectivity, of totalizing networks. Everything seems connected to everything else. As I wrote this article, I found each point leading, interactively, to other areas of inquiry, as if the novel, in its richness and complexity, were a Theory of Everything itself. My conclusion, however and therefore, cannot be a declaration of the single truth about the novel, a totalitarian declaration about the totality of the novel. More and more, we are all seeing the world as a vast interconnected network, and so we critics are seeing the worlds of fiction in the same way, and the writers of those fictions likewise. When we see our worlds this way, we often see conspiracies and totalitarian regimes, and sometimes we are right. Therefore, we need the transformative feedback mechanisms of dialectics to prevent that insidiously easy movement from friendship to regime. The heterogeneous site of Perdido Street Station provides such a dialectics. We must continue the conversation. NOTES 1. Mieville discusses the categorization of the novel in his interview in Locus with Charles Brown as well is in his interview with me. Mieville sees fantasy, science fiction, and horror as all parts of the same tradition, for which he prefers the term "weird fiction." 2. To see chaos theory used for such metaphorical ends, look particularly at N. Katherine Hayles's Chaos Bound and her edited collection Chaos and Order. For the "science wars" engendered by such use, see Alan Sokal's website (&lt;www.physics. nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/#papers&gt;), which includes his parody, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" (first published in Social Text in 1996), as well as further papers on the "Social Te-xt Affair." 3. A concise summary of this attribute of sf can be found in Brooks Landon's Science Fiction After 1900, which cites these other uses as well (8). Given the difficulty of claiming Perdido Street Station as only sf, I extend it here to a wider range of fantastic literatures. 4. Consideration of the bodies of Perdido Street Station might make use of Haraway's germinal Simians, Cyborgs, and Women, Judith Butler's Bodies That Matter, and Anne Balsamo's Technologies of the Gendered Body. 5. The term "hybrid zone" evokes Frantz Fanon's "zone of occult instability where the people dwell ... and it is there that our souls are crystallised and that our perceptions and our lives are transfused with light" (182). 6. Mieville's second novel in this fictional world, The Scar (2002), imagines a floating city of massed-together ships, a "perfect example," therefore, of a heterotopia. 7. The Construct Council echoes other famous utterances: I am Jaweh, I am Ubik, I am the Walrus. Its hubris is noted.</page><page sequence="20">HYBRIDITY, HETEROTOPIA, AND MATESHIP 475 8. I use friendship and mateship interchangeably and want to justify briefly my use of the word mateship in this article's title. First, this more commonly British and Australian locution suggests a seriously committed if not usually fulsomely articulated bond of mutual loyalty and equality, used less casually than "friend" is used in the U.S. Second, Mieville's first name has two sources: not only was China the "beautiful word" his parents were looking for in the dictionary, but it was also "Cockney rhyming slang for 'mate'.... 'my old china,' meaning 'my old mate' because 'china plate, mate"' (Gordon 355). 9. The government forces are fascistic and capitalistic, the criminal forces rampantly capitalist, the Construct Council forces emergently religious, worshiping the Construct Council as a god. 10.

ABSTRACT This article considers the ways in which China Mieville's Perdido Street Station (2000) exhibits its hybridity, by connecting notions of hybridity to those of the grotesque. It goes on to consider the novel in terms of heterotopia as Foucault discusses it. Last, it links ideas of hybridity and heterotopia to the idea of mateship, as the novel uses dialectics to form an interconnected and dynamic network.</page></plain_text>
