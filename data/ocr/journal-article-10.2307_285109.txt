(Longfellow, A Psalm to Life) The nineteenth century epitomized the idea that there was such a thing as progress, and that this progress could and would continue. 'Progress' was the natural, almost inevitable, outcome of science, rationality, industrialism and exploration. Explorations of the earth and the laws of nature, combined with civilized reasonableness, would enable the lot of all and sundry to be continuously improved. Colonization was the spread of civilization; industrialism was the spread of efficiency in handling nature. Great things were done in this atmosphere. The Crystal Palace was built in extraordinarily short time. There was an energy 'in the air', an atmosphere of optimism and activity. This attitude exists even in Karl Social Studies of Science (SAGE, London, Newbury Park and New Delhi), Vol. 20 (1990), 175-84</page><page sequence="2">176 Social Studies of Science Marx's criticism of capitalism, and his ideas of how it would be replaced by a scientific socialism with greatly expanded productivity, true abundance - which can be seen as an extension of this linear progress principle. (Whilst it might be unreasonable to accuse Marx of not realizing that there are retrogressions as well as progressions, the general tenor was Vorwdrts). There is an important sense in which this nineteenth-century optimism is an aberration in the Judeo-Christian world view. In a sense it is the intellectual legacy of Greece and of Rome's early days. The Judeo- Christian view regards the world (read man) as fatally flawed. Original sin, the fall, and the like, see a world which, whatever its original state, has passed into a period of essential decay. We do not have forever available to us to rehabilitate ourselves, only until the world of time and space has run its course. This is the most profound gloom and doom, and comes from a truncated world view. The world functions on the basis of three intellectually separable principles - creation, maintenance and decay. The Judeo-Christian view puts creation (and hence genuine creativity) outside the sphere of the world as it is, and ascribes it exclusively to God, who exercised this option once and for all at the beginning. All that is left is maintenance and decay.1 Scientifically, maintenance is accounted for in the conservation laws, energy, matter (or matter-energy since Einstein), momentum, and so on. Fairly naturally these were formulated first, as without the continuation of some identified substances or states there is great difficulty in describing what is going on. Decay is accounted for by the entropy law, the famous second law of thermodynamics, which has been variously interpreted as meaning that, overall, order always decreases and disorder always increases. This is a world poisoned by the presence of the sinful ones (that is, us). The world also has been punished for our sins (an interesting variant of the anthropic principle!). When creativity is favoured in our outlook there is optimism; when decay, pessimism. This is the tension which came to characterize the nineteenth century. The first of the three volumes reviewed here - Energy and Entropy: Science and Culture in Victorian Britain - gives us, through a selection of essays, a chance to taste this period. The editor provides a useful introduction and a moderate-sized index. (I believe that editors who do not provide good indexes, especially of volumes of very different essays, should have their names removed from the book covers as the minimum level of punishment!) The selection probably does not provide quite enough examples of the dead hand of decay casting its shadow over the</page><page sequence="3">Reviews: Nolan: Progress: The Very Idea! 177 optimism of Victorian decency, industry and the empire, though it captures the dominant optimism. Religion, which was severely impacted by science in the nineteenth century, can be seen as striking back through the entropy law - and that from within science itself. We can see that the vocabulary in which the struggle between pessimism and optimism is conducted has shifted to that of science. Science has become too strong to be overthrown directly: it must be from within, or not at all. Of course we should not think that Carnot had any idea of overthrowing science (or even specifically of exacerbating any feelings of pessimism) in his development of the concept of entropy. But he was looking for absolute constraints which set limits on what can be achieved, theoretical limits which can be approached but never reached or exceeded. The connections of this gloom and doom were elaborated in a more direct way by others later. By the end of the century, the intermingling of natural science ideas and social concepts was well developed and very sophisticated. Analogy across areas of intellectual enquiry was frequently appealed to. Myer's essay (the last in the book) on 'Thermodynamics and Social Prophecy' will I think interest many readers. The authors generally are historians (especially of the philosophy of science), and literati. The acceptance of the entropy law as truly characterizing all existence - with a hierarchy of physical, chemical, biological and social, all depending on the basis of the physical (and therefore on the discoveries in physics) - yields a view where the higher levels in such a hierarchy may not be completely constrained by those below in terms of their potentialities. That is, a reductionism which sees the nature of a higher level as predictably dependent on the lower may not be sustainable, but this higher level is constrained in that it cannot violate the laws which govern the lower level: it is therefore constrained, though reducible. This poses a great challenge to evolutionists and those who believe in progress. On one reading of the entropy law, evolution is not possible: the system of the world must be running down. However, this contradicts the 4evidence of the rocks', and much more besides. The world which 'evolves' from the Big Bang merely as a continuously expanding gas of plasma cloud is a world of idealized theory - a limiting case only, not the real world. In the real world, organization has spontaneously taken place and continues locally, globally and universally. It is therefore necessary to be able to explain how on the basis of verifiable principles this pattern of 'progress' has been brought about. There are a number of approaches to this question. One regards self- organization as possible for limited systems only at the 'expense' of an</page><page sequence="4">178 Social Studies of Science increased rate of dissipation for the whole - Prigogine's 'dissipative structures'.2 Another sees the principle of creativity as being just as real and ubiquitous as decay, but harder to formalize and as yet rather poorly understood. This is a developing area in science, and may well lead us to accept Buckminster Fuller's contention that entropy neither increases nor decreases for the universe as a whole. I will argue elsewhere that the extension of entropy increase from a 'partial equilibrium' viewpoint to a general equilibrium viewpoint is invalid: entropy increase is always in context, and all such contexts are necessarily partial.3 The most radical approach in one sense (that of Brooks and Wiley), is to take the view that evolution does not take place in spite of entropy increase, but is an expression of it. Such a view does not see progress as the working out of a tension between creation and destruction; 'progress' is how destruction expresses itself - or, at least, part of how it does. Potentially this is a very subtle point of view. In the Vedic literature we see the working out of the pattern of evolution over time as the interplay of the three Gunas - Rajas, Sattva and Tamas. Rajas is creation, which is personified by Brahma; Sattva is maintenance, which is personified by Vishnu; Tamas is destruction, which is personified by Shiva. These three principles are never isolated; they cannot exist alone, for it is always a question of who has the upper hand at the moment. The victory of one is the ground from which the other necessarily emerges. In this sense creation is always the child of destruction, and maintenance of creation, and finally destruction of maintenance. Each phase is an imbalance which gives rise to the new imbalance of somewhat different nature. The other two volumes reviewed here attack this question from rather different points of view. Evolutionary Progress tries to come to grips with the concept of progress both biologically and socially. Can we say that one organism has progressed more than another; can one society be said to be more evolved than another? What do thes statements mean? Again there is a good range of essays, a preface which begins with a discussion on pessimism, and an adequate index. The authors are ecologists, biologists, philosophers and historians. Natural science is much more dominant than in Brantlinger's book on the nineteenth century. This is very much a twentieth-century volume. Not surprisingly progress turns out to be a difficult concept, as there is no absolute yardstick which can readily be applied. The attempt to objectify it leads to the final essay in this volume, by Stephen Jay Gould, in which he seeks to replace 4progress' with an 'operational notion of directionality'. The attempt to remove the subjective, anthropomorphic, and insert a purely objective, derived criterion, denies the role of the observer. This runs counter to</page><page sequence="5">Reviews: Nolan: Progress: The Very Idea! 179 (modern science' and is a reflection of the more general confusion which exists over the relationship between subjective and objective forms of knowing. Cognition requires subject, object and process of knowing, a tri-partite analysis. We can characterize the subjective and objective ways of knowing as the difference between complete knowing by identification, the feeling that we know everything but know nothing in terms of detail (that is, the subjective or the intuitive), and the step-by- step accumulation of knowledge which is never complete (that is, the knowledge of boundaries, the knowledge of the 'object' of knowing, scientific externalized knowing, knowledge supposedly independent of particular observers). It is this latter which Gould proposes as an alternative to a concept which is imbued with human value systems. Progress without human evaluation, a mirage! This objective knowledge is the 'construction' of the object by means of the investigation of its attributes (which are inexhaustible) or contexts, the possible number of which is infinite. This intellectual process cannot be separated from the doer, the so-called subject. There is no way to remove the human, the conscious being. The objectification which posits a world totally independent of our existence is the same view which leads to acceptance of the idea of absolute separation between subject and object. If this was possible there would be no way of bridging the gap. This is the underlying basis of the famous thought experiment of Einstein, Rosen and Podolsky, asserting the absolute determinism of nature (itself logically contradictory), which has been challenged by the experimental claims of confirmation of Bell's Theorem. If these claims survive, at least one of the cherished nineteenth-century mechanical-materialist propositions must be given up, the most likely candidate being local causality (that is, causality which is confined to proximate influence). What we have then is the construction, bit by bit, of the 'objective picture' of the world by the externalization of the subjective, which is already one with the world: the Kyvalia of Yoga point value 0 expanded to individual boundaries Evolutionary Progress raises interesting questions, but the answers it offers are less than satisfying, mostly because of its approach to the nature of knowledge.</page><page sequence="6">180 Social Studies of Science The third volume, Evolution as Entropy, attempts the radical task of restructuring evolutionary biology so that it is seen as an expression of the tendency of entropy to increase. To understand the argument, we need to recapitulate a little on the entropy concept. Entropy was invented to characterize an attribute of energy. Energy had been conceptualized in a way which conformed to the conservation principle and expressed in part the continuity of the world. The quantitative measure expressed its existence value, but ignored its activity or creative value. The oceans are a vast store of heat energy which, through the absence of an 'adjacent' low temperature sink (that is, some- where for the heat to flow to), cannot do any useful work and does not provide us with a free ride. The couple of degrees absolute microwave radiation which permeates space represents a vast energy flux which has just about completely lost its ability to initiate any change. It exists, but its potential has been used up. Because of the significance of these juxtapositions the ordinary perception of 'energeticness', the ability to make something happen, needed to be expressed in some way. Initially people talked of energy being free (able to cause something to happen) or bound (no longer able to cause something to happen). The entropy index which was devised has low numbers for high potential, and high numbers for low potential. This is probably unfortunate, but we are stuck with it. Looking at temperature (really temperature difference) as the source of potential, we get maximum potential at infinite temperature (the Big Bang) and zero potential at absolute zero (heat death of the universe, -273?C). The entropy index goes from zero at the Big Bang to infinity when space is cold, black, and indistinguishable from absolute zero everywhere. This view of entropy gives us a ladder to position processes on: Absolute Temperature heat input ! T1 _T2 - | heat input Absolute Zero 00 K</page><page sequence="7">Reviews: Nolan: Progress: The Very Idea! 181 The process extracts 'useful work' by reducing the temperature from TI to T2. Carnot showed that even a perfect machine cannot be any more efficient than: T- To T In other words, the limiting efficiency is set by how close we can get to absolute zero in the discharge of heat - that is, the condition under which energy becomes bound in this context. The entropy calculations reflect this by: AS _A T where AS = increment in entropy; AE = increment in energy; and T absolute temperature. There is more increase in entropy (loss of potential) if the energy can be discharged at a lower temperature. Ludwig Boltzmann reformulated entropy to reflect the statistical properties of gases, and the distribution of the velocities of their constituent molecules. He arrived at a precise mathematical formulation, in which entropy is expressed in terms of the probability of any state of the system.4 This approach has been generalized as an abstract distributional measure applicable to many fields. While it is considered by some to be controversial (Georgescu- Roegen maintains that entropy should remain an opaque concept, confined to its initial derivation), it is very widely used and is the accepted norm of science today. Brooks and Wiley seek to relate complexity, organization and entropy using measures of this type. Their book is very different from the other two. They set out to define evolution (which we call progress) as: an axiomatic consequence of organismic information and cohesion systems obeying the second law of thermodynamics in a manner analogous to, but not identical with, the consequences of the second law's usual application in physical and chemical system. (xi) In doing this, they hope to go beyond the limitations of neo-Darwinian proximal cause, to avoid any teleological explanation which the inadequacy of Darwinian proximalism might tend to suggest, to see history as having a very real role to play in providing constraints on the pattern of attribute emergence and through changes in</page><page sequence="8">182 Social Studies of Science the understanding [of] the nature of entropy production, or entropy increases. in non- equilibrium systems ... [because] We consider the time-dependent behaviour embodied in the second law of thermodynamics to be more general than the concept of energy flows for which the law was originally formulated. (xiii) in order to show that The axiomatic behaviour of living systems should be increasing complexity and self organisation as a result of, not at the expense of, increasing entropy. (xiv) They have set themselves a tall order because they have taken a natural law which is usually understood to be the formalization of the principle of decay, and they have called on it to do double duty. It must also provide the mechanism, we might say the inevitability, of self-organization and evolution. Entropy is to be both Shiva and Brahma, so that no 'supernatural Brahma' (what the Vedantists call Mother Devine) is needed. In a sense this separates creativity, as expressed in evolution, from creation, the coming into being of that which evolves. The weakness of this is that the escape from the Newtonianism which they saw as the consequence of the excessive reliance on Darwinian proximate cause has not been complete. The issue here is whether creation is a once for all process, like the Big Bang, or whether creation is in fact continuous. If creation is continuous then the growth of time and space is the macroscopic aspect of continuous creation. Time does not consist of rearranging an existing ensemble in fixed space (whether finite or infinite). The latter would only be a form of super Newtonianism. Stephen Hawking tells us that the paradox of the singularities of beginning and ending of the universe with their infinite intensities, under which all natural laws break down, is an artifact of limited normal conscious perception, which is bound by time and space.6 It would be better to conceive of the universe as being a trip from one pole of a globe to the other, in which the densities of the world lines, where they cross, seem infinite but are not. Past, present and future no longer have their old significance. This is the sort of view we hear from the Zen Masters (and from Albert Einstein). The standpoint the authors have taken leads them to categorize increased complexity of living creatures and their hierarchical relationships as an increase in entropy as well as an adaptive advantage. They say that they unify five areas of current research in evolutionary biology: (1) the relationship between thermodynamics and biology. (2) scaling theory, (3) hierarchy theory, (4) constraint theory and, (5) macroevolution.</page><page sequence="9">Book Notes 183 The biological arrow of time is the thermodynamic arrow. At short time intervals, biological systems at various levels of organisation behave like dissipative structures idealisations. At longer time intervals, they behave like expanding phase space idealisations ... Biological diversity can be seen as the result of interactions over long time scales of the genealogical hierarchy and the ecological hierarchy. The genealogical hierachy represents the biological manifestation of entropy production by irreversible biological processes. The ecological hierarchy represents the manner in which entropy gradients in the surroundings are biologically useful. (370-71) Their conclusions and explorations cover a wide range and do not stand or fall totally on the basis of their approach to entropy. The cutting edge of physical science today is chaos theory and fractal geometry. In the fractals we see a geometry where space-time is full but is not a compact set. There are gaps in which the new can continually emerge. The Mandelbrot set is a knife edge between rigid crystallized form and dissolution, the balance between coming into being and dissolving which provides the room for renewal and replacement. Self- organization, in my opinion, will become formalized as science continues with these areas of investigation, rather than under the umbrella of entropy alone. Notwithstanding this reservation, the book warrants a very careful reading and much thought. Perhaps we can call it 'progress' restored - but not quite adequately supported! * NOTES 1. See Stephen W.

Ilya Prigogine has developed a theory of self-organization based on increased entropy creation in conditions well away from equilibrium. The closed regime decreases its internal entropy (or at least maintains it without increase) at the expense of export of increased entropy to the environment.
