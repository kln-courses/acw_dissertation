The paper analyzes the fundamental dif- ferences of opinion between Bohr and the mathematical physicists, Heisenberg and Born, concerning the foundational doctrine of the "indispensability of clas- sical concepts", and their related disagreements on "quantum reality." The paper concludes with an explanation of how the appearance of consensus was achieved despite fundamental disagreements among the proponents. The paper undermines the adequacy of the notion of a general conceptual framework to describe the philosophical endeavors of working scientists. 1. Introduction. Strong realistic and positivistic strands are present in the writings of the founders of the quantum revolution-Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli and Born. Militant positivistic declarations are frequently followed by fervent denial of adherence to positivism. No wonder different scholars, with good textual evidence, have provided conflicting interpretations of these writings: while Popper (1963) presented Bohr as a "subjectivist," Feyerabend (1981) found him an "objectivist;" more recently, Murdoch (1987) concluded that Bohr was a realist, while Faye (1991) argued with equal competence that Bohr was an antirealist. The "realistic" vs. "anti- realistic" nature of Bohr's philosophy is a topic of great interest, as is demonstrated by a recent collection of essays on Bohr's philosophy (Faye and Folse 1994). While scholars have invested competence and ingenuity to render Bohr's position consistent, I will adopt a different attitude and accept that the conflicting opinions of realism and positivism (in Bohr's instrumentalistic or Heisenberg's operationalistic versions) are both un- deniably present. My aim is not to cure this "schizophrenia" (character- ization in Fine 1986) by eliminating the inconsistencies, but to analyze the sources, uses, and aims of such shifting philosophical positions, on both conceptual and sociological levels. *Received April 1995; revised December 1995. tSend reprint requests to the author, Philosophy Department, Hebrew University, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, 91905, Israel.

It is often the incon- sistencies that provide the most faithful guide to the local theorizing, so different from the "rational reconstruction." This paper supports the stand that ideas can properly be understood only by an analysis of their local theoretical and sociopolitical emergence and use.' It also supports the approach which critically objects to what Skinner (1969) christened a "mythology of doctrines" and "mythology of coherence."2 The first mythology assumes that philosophical writings nec- essarily deal with some "eternal" epistemological or ontological questions, such as that of "realism" of atoms. Bohr, for example, is often classified as "realist" because he "never doubts" the reality of atoms. The second mythology, that of "coherence," presupposes that philosophical writings are in principle intended to produce a systematic contribution to their subject, and that to "understand" such writings means to produce, at whatever cost, the most coherent and contradiction-free presentations of their content. I suggest that such "mythologies" are especially inapplicable to interpretive explorations by working scientists, who espouse their phil- osophical positions in changing theoretical and sociopolitical circum- stances. I will argue that different pronouncements by quantum physicists on the realism-antirealism issue can be fruitfully understood by differentiat- ing between what scientists "need not" and "must not" do. It is the local "need not," rather than the universal "must not," which turns out to be most relevant to scientists' philosophical deliberations. This paper also explores the antirealism of Bohr as a potent cohesive force inside the community of physicists and as a way to prevent its alien- ation from wider cultural circles. For this reason, I suggest, Heisenberg and Born often supported Bohr's position, although it was incompatible with their own. Such public support is one of the major sources of con- tradictions in Heisenberg's and Born's writings. Under closer scrutiny the "Copenhagen" paradigm has neither coher- ence nor stability, despite the massive rhetoric of its "inevitability" by Bohr and his followers.3 The "Copenhagen" philosophy can thus be seen as a 'This stand, from Collingwood (1939) and Wittgenstein (1953), through Rorty (1979) and Fine (1986), now has an overwhelming following by scholars dealing with social studies of science and the rhetoric of science. Some of the prominent examples include Collins (1982), Shapin and Schaffer (1985), Knorr-Cetina (1981), Galison (1987), Latour (1987) and Pick- ering (1992). However, these intellectual currents hardly touched the historiography and philosophy of quantum mechanics. One of the best recent histories of early quantum physics, Darrigol 1992, exemplifies this point. 2I am grateful to Menachem Fisch, who made me aware of the similarity between the ideas expressed in the first draft of this paper and the writings of Skinner. 3For an analysis of Bohr's rhetoric of inevitability, see Beller 1993. 184</page><page sequence="3">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 185 contingent composite of different philosophical strands, whose public face hides competing and constantly shifting differences among its founders. If philosophical pronouncements by quantum physicists are most ade- quately understood as local, shifting, and opportunistic, the question arises of how the appearance of consensus is achieved. The concluding pages of this paper address that issue. 2. What Scientists "Need Not" and "Must Not" Do. One of the most useful hints for dealing with the realism-positivism problem can be found in Feynman's (1969) distinction between what scientists "must not" and "need not" do. It is wrong to say that scientists "must not" presuppose reality, aiming at elimination of all unobservable theoretical entities. Feyn- man believes that no creative scientific theorizing can proceed in such an imaginative vacuum. Yet when certain realistic and seemingly indispen- sable notions lead to contradictions, one can eliminate them, provided that a consistent interpretation of experiments is possible without their use. In the two-slit experiment, one "need not" assume that a particle does indeed have a well-defined path between the two-slit diaphragm and the detector (Feynman 1969, 38-8, 38-9). "Need not" is an integral part of scientific practice, without which such breakthroughs as the rejection of absolute simultaneity in relativity theory and the rejection of a strict deterministic framework in quantum theory would not have been possible. "Must not" is a positivistic excess, being at odds with the practice of science, which relies on realistic inspirations as a source of scientists' motivation for research and on realistic models as a heuristic guide for discovery.4 Much confusion on the realism-antirealism issue in quantum physics is caused by the lack of discrimination between the local "need not" and an overarching "must not." When Heisenberg dispensed with the electronic orbits and the space-time container in his reinterpretation paper (Heisen- berg 1925), he did so to provide a novel solution, incompatible with the assumption of the existence of orbits. He realized that he "need not" keep the electronic orbits, because they "cannot be observed anyway" (Heisen- berg to Kronig, 1925, AHQP). I have argued elsewhere that the overall philosophy of elimination of unobservables was adopted by Heisenberg a posteriori in order to legitimize his unconventional and highly formal so- lution (Beller 1983, 1988). Yet Heisenberg soon realized that such an el- evation of the local "need not" into a status of universal "must not" was too hasty. He admitted in his Chicago lectures: ". . . to avoid these con- 40n "motivational realism" see Fine 1986. McKinnon (1977) argued that the "virtual oscillator" heuristic model was crucial for Heisenberg's road to the new quantum theory. On a strong presence of realistic notions in what is usually taken as developments charac- terized by positivistic and instrumentalistic philosophy, see Beller 1992.</page><page sequence="4">MARA BELLER tradictions [between quantum theory and experiment-M.B.], it seems necessary to demand that no concept enter a theory which has not been experimentally verified . . . Unfortunately, it is quite impossible to fulfill this requirement" (Heisenberg 1930, 1-2). Born's positivistic statements are also best understood on the level of the local "need not." When Born provided a probabilistic solution of the collision problem and a probabilistic interpretation of the wave-function, he did not hold that a more detailed deterministic description in terms of microscopic coordinates is forbidden in principle (Beller 1990). Yet the- oretical physicists "need not" seek such description because Born's own probabilistic theory is sufficient, being in perfect accord with the practice of experimentalists: "Earlier, it was supposed ... that there is meaning in the question: 'When and where election is ejected.' . . . Suppose that we decide to renounce this question, an act which is the easier inasmuch as no experimenter would think of asking it" (Born 1928, 32).5 In order to protect quantum theory from the charge of incompleteness, or perhaps even of inconsistency (Beller and Fine 1994), Bohr had to counter the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen challenge by arguing that one "need not" assume the reality of certain atomic attributes, independent of the process of measurement. Reality became, by definition, "what quantum mechanics is capable of describing" (Rosen's remark, quoted in Heilbron 1988, 219). Pauli and Heisenberg, who supported Bohr, did not feel at ease with an explicit positivistic approach; we should not confuse their reluctant concession to positivistic legitimization with a voluntary em- brace of a positivistic stand. According to Pauli, one does not have to be an "empiricist," in order to realize that certain realistic forms of thought (Denkformen) are not necessary for a successful construction of a physical theory (Pauli 1954, 123). Heisenberg's notion of "practical" versus "dogmatic" realism was similarly aimed to provide enough leeway for positivistic protection of quantum theory from possible objections, without thereby losing the re- alistic ground altogether (Heisenberg 1958). According to Heisenberg, "practical" and "dogmatic" realism differ in the way they "objectivate" experience. A statement is "objectivated" if its content does not depend upon conditions of its verification. Dogmatic realism assumes that there are no statements concerning the material world that cannot be objecti- vated. Practical realism assumes that many, but not all, statements can be objectivated. Practical realism is indispensable for scientific work: "every scientist who does research work feels that he is looking for something that is objectively true" (Heisenberg 1958, 82). Practical realism, according to Heisenberg (1958, 82), "has always been 5Throughout this article, page numbers for the quotations from Born's papers are from the collection Born 1956. 186</page><page sequence="5">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 187 and will always be an essential part of natural science." What quantum mechanics demonstrated is that good science is possible without the basis of dogmatic realism. While Heisenberg's pragmatic notion of practical realism is not compatible with Bohr's operational definition of physical "phenomenon," both are directed towards the same aim-to unburden physics from those troublesome realistic notions that "need not" be pre- supposed in the quantum description. 3. Appeal of Antirealism-Some General Considerations. Antirealist phil- osophical strands also have a wider significance, both philosophically and historically. The appeal of antirealism varies substantially in different the- oretical and sociopolitical contexts. In the past, antirealistic sentiments were often invoked due to the realization that equivalent accounts of the same domain of phenomena are possible. Demonstrations of the possi- bility of equivalent descriptions-such as Hipparchus' in antiquity, Poin- care's in the nineteenth century, or the equivalence of wave and matrix mechanics-strengthened the notion of science as merely a device "to save the phenomena."6 Thus Bridgman argued that the "quest for underlying reality" is a meaningless one, when one realizes that two explanations of the same phenomena can be equally true: However much one might have been inclined fifty years ago to see some warrant for ascribing physical reality to the internal processes of a theory ... certainly no one of the present generation will be capable of so naive an attitude after our illuminating experience of the physical equivalence of the matrix calculus and the wave mechan- ics. (Bridgman 1930, 21) The attraction of such antirealistic attitudes becomes especially strong when one is eager to avoid the clash between the findings of science and religious teachings and aspirations, be it Osiander's preface to Copernicus' treatise or scientists' defense against the accusations of theologians in the nineteenth century. Antirealism is especially valuable when one wants to protect science (and society) from undesirable extensions of scientific metaphysics into the political realm. Philipp Frank, in letters to Bohr in 1936, tried to convince Bohr to join the camp of outspoken positivists. The duty of every physicist, pleaded Frank, is to counter mystical inter- pretations of quantum physics, which were exploited by national social- istic elements to support reactionary political philosophy and a barbaric 6About Hipparchus' demonstration of the equivalent description of celestial motions by using either epicycles or eccentrics, see Duhem 1991. Poincare's leadership in antirealistic "descriptionistic" movement is explored in Heilbron 1982. Convincing modern arguments in favor of this view of science are in von Frassen (1980). About the conflict between scientific realism and the possibility of equivalent theories see Ben-Menahem 1990.</page><page sequence="6">MARA BELLER regime. Only a consistent positivistic stand can ensure insulation of phys- icists' words from such a misuse (Beller and Fine 1994, 20). The antirealistic approach can also become a potent cohesive force in the scientific community. In the beginning of the century, Duhem argued that a positivistic view of science, avoiding the minefields of metaphysics, allows the achievement of the largest assent in the scientific community. The discord that can be brought by competition of different models, each claiming a privileged road to truth, was eloquently displayed in a fierce and bitter confrontation between Heisenberg and Schrodinger over the superiority of their equivalent theories. Bohr's Como lecture, and the sub- sequent antirealistic philosophy of complementarity, was aimed not only to "harmonize" the discordant theoretical notions, but to pacify the an- tagonized factions in the community of physicists: "I shall try to describe to you a certain general point of view which I hope will be helpful in order to harmonize the apparently conflicting views taken by different scientists" (Bohr 1927, 1928, 565, 580). Pauli, the architect behind the scenes of major interpretative breakthroughs in quantum physics, understood the crucial importance of Bohr's unifying mission. "Niels Bohr," he announced, "in- tegrated, in lectures and international congresses, and at those carefully planned conferences in Copenhagen, the diverse scientific standpoints and epistemological attitudes, and thereby imparted ... the feeling of belong- ing, in spite of all their [physicists'] dissensions, to one large family" (Pauli 1945, 97). As the head of this large family, Bohr did not tolerate quarrels. He considered Einstein's criticism of the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics "high treason." Being the official spokesman of this commu- nity, he worried that too much dissent might harm the physicists' image and power. In an interview with Kuhn, Bohr complained about Einstein's objections to the Copenhagen philosophy: "That, of course, is really the difficulty ... that the philosopher says: When the atomic physicists do not agree, why should we trouble?" (AHQP, Dec. 17, 1962). Bohr's antirealistic philosophy was uniquely designed not only to pre- vent a discord inside the collective of quantum physicists, but also to pre- vent an alienation of this collective from the rest of the scientific com- munity. The appeal of Bohr's teachings was considerably enhanced by Bohr's immense authority, personal charisma and powerful institutional placing. Bohr's "father-image" goes a long way to explain the wide- spreading diffusion of the Copenhagen spirit (Heilbron 1988). Yet it is the special role of Bohr's antirealism as a potent cohesive force that is largely responsible for the unprecedented appeal of the Copenhagen philosophy. The new quantum physics was a theory of unprecedented complexity and abstraction, especially in its matrix and operator formulation. By re- nouncing visualization in space-time, quantum theory challenged intui- 188</page><page sequence="7">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 189 tion, Anschaulichkeit, and common sense even farther than general rela- tivity did just a few years earlier. The ascendancy of the profession of theoretical physics at the beginning of the twentieth century threatened to upset the well established hierarchy of the German physics community (with the experimentation and the collection of data at the top). Theoret- ical physicists seemed to alienate themselves even further from the rest of the scientific community with the rise of the new quantum theory. The unintuitiveness (Unanschaulichkeit) of the abstract matrix mechanics was anything but appealing: Heisenberg had to witness painfully how Schro- dinger's intuitive theory immediately enchanted not only the so-called con- servatives, such as Planck, not only experimentalists, such as Wien, but many able young theoreticians, such as London and Fermi (Beller 1992). Schr6dinger openly objected to the formidable complexity of the matrix mechanics, warning that its lack of Anschaulichkeit will be detrimental to scientific progress. Heisenberg's response-the restoration of space-time and Anschaulichkeit by an operational analysis of scientific notions in thought experiments in his uncertainty paper (Heisenberg 1927) was a very clever defense of this highly abstract theory. This operational analysis, despite Bohr's initial objection (in Bohr 1927), became a paradigmatic example in Bohr's later legitimization and elaboration of quantum phi- losophy. Bohr's numerous illustrations of mutually exclusive experimental arrangements (with bolts, springs, diaphragms, and rods) made experi- mentalists feel at ease while encountering unfamiliar quantum territory. These simple considerations, supplemented with Bohr's potent persuasive technique, which disguised considerations of consistency into compelling arguments of inevitability, made the far-reaching and controversial con- clusions appear as inescapable (Beller 1996). No mathematical training and merely a most elementary physics was needed to follow Bohr's ar- guments. "The recent development caused much anxiety among physicists and philosophers," announced Bohr in one of his numerous talks, "and one has only to overcome these problems in a very simple way" (Bohr 1935). Bohr's simple way alleviated anxiety, transforming every reader into a "virtual witness," to use Shapin and Schaffer's (1985) term. It re- moved the threat of esoteric and unintuitive theory, making quantum mys- tery widely accessible. English experimental physicists felt especially at home with Bohr's drawings, so reminiscent of Duhem's (1991) description of an English fac- tory. The English experimentalist Donnan was especially enthusiastic: "As you point out, physical reality can only be defined by means of experi- ments and measurement ... Your logic-based on the complementary possibilities of different experimental arrangements in assigning definite and unambiguous meaning to the values of any pair of canonically con- jugate variables-seems unassailable ... It is not a question of abstruse</page><page sequence="8">MARA BELLER math but of an entirely new standpoint" (Donnan to Bohr, AHQP, July 26, 1935). In the early 1930s, Bridgman described the anxiety and the resentment that was caused in the physics community by the rapidly shifting foun- dations of physics, especially those due to changes implied by the new quantum theory. The resentment and the anxiety was caused by "mathe- matical theories, which are being continually formulated at an ever in- creasing tempo, and in complexity and abstractness increasingly formi- dable" (Bridgman 1930, 21). Yet the "average physicist ... who flounders in bewilderment" need not feel lost: "since the new theories are formulated as to be consistent with the cardinal principle that the properties of the thing have no meaning which is not contained in some describable expe- rience, our intuition should be able to tell us what to expect in various experimental situations .. ." (ibid). An analysis of thought experiments, using simple intuitions, is open to every physicist and "would be found by many ... to give a more illuminating insight than a painful acquisition of the details of the present mathematical picture" (ibid). Operational anal- ysis, such as Heisenberg's and Bohr's, was the anchor and the therapy that Bridgman offered to boost the confidence in the age of uncertainty. Yet Bridgman's case shows eloquently the dangers of operationalism, if it is applied too diligently. Operationalism can undermine any well- established scientific theory, be it statistical thermodynamics or cosmol- ogy, by attacking its foundations as going beyond the possibility of ex- perimental verification. Cosmologists resented such an attack on the integrity of their discipline (Beller 1988). It is this kind of offense that Bohr's philosophy carefully and ingeniously avoided. The unique appeal of Bohr's philosophy resides precisely in the way it protects the macro-realm and well established clas- sical theories from the dangers of such an approach, while fully enjoying the fruits of antirealism in the micro-domain. This is achieved by Bohr's division of the physical world into two radically different parts-classical and quantum-and by Bohr's notorious doctrine of the indispensability of classical concept. Before elaborating this claim, I will describe Bohr's position, opposed to that of many mathematical physicists', including Born's and Heisenberg's. 4. Reality, Classical Concepts, and Symbols. One of the greatest discrep- ancies between Bohr and his more mathematically-minded colleagues con- cerns the question of "quantum reality" and the "necessity of the classical concepts." Bohr transformed the fact that one "can" describe the mac- roscopic measuring device by classical concepts (as opposed to micro- objects, where one cannot do so) into "has to," and into the doctrine of the indispensability of the classical concepts. Supplemented by the oper- 190</page><page sequence="9">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 191 ationalistic stand, this doctrine resulted in Bohr's peculiar denial of the possibility of "quantum concepts" and "quantum reality." According to Bohr, a symbolic description, removed from the com- monsense and familiar classical visualization, can be nothing else but a tool for the correlation of experiments. The fact that one "need not," if one wishes, endow such a description with realistic meaning, was trans- formed by Bohr into one "must not" and "can not" do so. Bohr's doctrine of indispensability of classical concepts rests on several key ideas that are not shared even by his closest collaborators, Heisenberg and Born. No- torious among these are Bohr's assertions about alleged proximity be- tween classical and commonsense notions, and a direct accessibility of classical reality to our immediate sense perception. Bohr's belief in this direct accessibility is rooted in the Kantian heritage of space-time concepts as forms of intuition (Anschauung), and in his life- long reliance on visualizable classical space-time models of the atom as a basis for correspondence arguments (for the former, see Faye 1991 and Chevalley 1994; for the latter, Darrigol 1992). The idea that the classical world is directly revealed to our senses is a recurrent theme in Bohr's writings: "The older views correspond to a ... certain region of phenom- ena-which are directly open to observation of our senses" (Bohr 1938). This direct and necessary connection between the classical concepts and the experienced sense impressions ensures the absolute indispensability of classical concepts: "there can be no question of course of abandoning the conceptual frame of our conscious recording of sense impressions" (Bohr 1938). Yet Bohr's intuitions of what is "real" and what is not, are con- nected with visualizability of a conceptual notion, not with its observabil- ity. That is why atoms are "real"-the calculation of their mass and charge are based on visualizable laws of classical electrodynamics. Yet when we deal with the unvisualizable symbolic description of the same atom, we should leave all questions of its "nature" behind. Because classical concepts are inapplicable, or limited, in the quantum domain, and only classical concepts are "anschaulich" and therefore "real," there can be no question of "quantum reality." There is no compelling argument for the reality of classical description as opposed to the quantum one except this alleged Kantian kinship between visualizability of classical physics and our sense perceptions. According to Bohr, the commonsense conceptions and ordinary lan- guage is a foundation on which all communication, and therefore ulti- mately all science, rests. According to Born and Heisenberg, the common sense is profoundly mistaken. In Born's opinion, the guiding factor in the development of science is "a belief in a real external world and ability to distrust sensation" (Born 1928, 20). Born held that commonsense and scientific concepts are greatly removed from each other. Concepts of clas-</page><page sequence="10">MARA BELLER sical mechanics are not extensions of common sense. The fact that in clas- sical physics one uses such anthropomorphic terms as "mass" and "force" that are also used in common language is misleading: "their sound is the same as words of ordinary speech, yet their meaning can be found only from specially formulated definitions," and can be apprehended "only with the aid of mathematical tools" (ibid., 21). The word "gravitation" is an "artificial concept," which has little in common with the simple idea the feeling of force (ibid.). Far from being an extension of commonsense regularities, the laws of classical mechanics "cannot be enunciated without ideas which lie far outside the natural limits of thought" (ibid.). Justifi- cation of classical concepts is based on nothing else but "their place in the system of objective natural science" (ibid.). Because justification of clas- sical concepts is due to their role in the abstract conceptual framework of classical theory, their reality (or lack thereof) is not different from the case of the concepts of quantum theory. There is no principal difference be- tween classical and quantum concepts. If reality is ascribed to the best entrenched theoretical concepts, they become "real" no matter how abstract. The exposure to general relativity weaned physicists from their familiar classical intuitions, and developed such "realistic" symbolic sensitivities. Einstein and his followers ascribed genuine reality to the four-dimensional space-time and tensor fields, not to the familiar classical space and time notions. Despite demanding sym- bolization, these concepts became "real" for physicists by being included into a new comprehensive and consistent theory. It is the familiar space and time notions that became less "real": ". . . the familiar geometry of Euclid and the corresponding time are now reduced to mere approxima- tion to reality" (Born 1928, 25). Similarly, Heisenberg, reeducating our Anschaulichkeit in his uncer- tainty paper, argued that the simplest interpretation of the space coordi- nates in quantum theory is obtained by identifying them with diagonal terms of appropriate matrices: The prediction that, say, the velocity in the X-direction is 'in reality' not a number but the diagonal term of the matrix, is perhaps no more abstract and no more unvisualizable than the statement that the elec- tric field strengths are in "reality" the time part of an antisymmetric tensor located in space-time. The phrase 'in reality' here is as much and as little justified as it is in any mathematical description of natural processes. (Heisenberg 1927)7 Heisenberg's published works and the reminiscences of his student, von Weiszacker, testify that Heisenberg did not embrace Bohr's radical split of the world into two unbridgeable realms: 7This quote is taken from a translation of Heisenberg's paper in Wheeler and Zurek 1983. 192</page><page sequence="11">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 193 Heisenberg never seriously considered the idea that quantum theory might be limited to microscopic objects; ... he considered quantum theory as universally valid and classical physics as macroscopic ap- proximation. (von Weizsacker 1987, 283) This willingness to reeducate our intuitions and to redefine reality char- acterized mathematical physicists working in the quantum theory. Far from believing that no new conceptual realistic schemes are possible, Born held that the development of such new conceptual forms is the very essence of scientific advance. By developing new invariants, physicists will grad- ually learn to handle them intuitively. As a result of such a process, "new conceptions sink down into the unconscious mind, they find adequate names, and are absorbed into the general knowledge of mankind" (Born, 1928, 52). Bohr, being a "natural philosopher, and not a mathematical physicist" (Heisenberg's characterization), did not possess the familiarity and facility for handling such abstract mathematical formalism as demanded by gen- eral relativity. In fact, his familiarity with general relativity was very lim- ited (Pais 1991). His objections to the possibility of new conceptual schemes are peculiarly reminiscent of the objections of the neo-Kantian opponents to general relativity. Bohr did not experience the gradual in- ternalization of the tools of the new quantum symbolism, which can come only through everyday mathematical labor. For him, only the classical realm remained intuitively accessible and therefore "real." In his later years, Bohr replaced the initial Kantian emphasis on the impossibility of the new conceptual forms with a different argument for the indispensability of the classical concepts. This argument was based on Bohr's post E-P-R employment of operationalism, and on his doctrine of the unambiguous communication of measurement results in terms of com- mon language. Bohr held that classical language, being a natural extension of common language, is the only possible language to communicate the physical experience. The following lines are typical for later Bohr: "In each case we must be able to communicate what we have done ... and therefore the measurement instrument must be described within the framework of classical physical ideas" (Bohr 1955). According to Bohr, the unambigu- ous communication of measurement results is the only possible way to ensure the objectivity of scientific enterprise (a penetrating analysis is in Hooker 1972 and 1991). Together with instrumentalistic insistence on quantum formalism as being merely a tool for coordinating measurement results, Bohr delineates the classical realm as the only one where realistic talk can be meaningful. Any creative efforts to construct the quantum world becomes pointless and bound to failure. Yet the doctrine of the indispensability of classical concepts for the</page><page sequence="12">MARA BELLER unambiguous measurement description does not by itself prohibit the con- struction of quantum reality. An emphasis on experiment is not at odds with realistic strivings, as is eminently displayed in Born's, Heisenberg's, and Pauli's writings. Born reveals: "In physics, all 'experience' consists in the ability of constructing apparatus and of instruments' pointer readings. Yet the results thereby obtained suffice to re-create the cosmos by thought" (Born 1928, 36). Nor do Bohr's mathematical colleagues share Bohr's opinion that the unambiguity of communication demands the use of common language. Quite the opposite stand is expressed by Heisenberg: scientific unambi- guity cannot be achieved by ordinary language. The concepts of ordinary language are "inaccurate and only vaguely defined ... the concepts of the general laws must in natural science be defined with complete precision, and this can be achieved only by means of mathematical abstraction" (Heisenberg 1958, 172). Far from being immutable, scientific language evolves in the process of the growth of scientific knowledge: "new terms are introduced and the old ones are applied in a wider field or differently from ordinary language ... in the theory of general relativity the language by which we describe the general laws actually now follows the scientific language of the mathematicians" (ibid.). 5. Bohr's Correspondence with Born and Fock. While not many working physicists shared Bohr's strictures on "quantum concepts" and "quantum reality," their disagreement with Bohr rarely reached the printed page. Yet often such disagreement was unequivocal and forceful. Bohr's corre- spondence with his life-long colleague, M. Born, and with the Russian physicist V. Fock, are characteristic examples. Fock attacked the central points of Bohr's philosophy in his letter to Bohr of February 23, 1957, and in a paper published in the Russian pe- riodical Uspeckifiziceskich nauk (66, 1958, 599-602) (A copy of Fock's own translation of his paper is located in Bohr's Archive, AHQP). Both Fock and Born were amazed by Bohr's denial of quantum concepts, and frustrated by his inability to comprehend the underlying quantum reality. Thus, Fock argues: "... it is not only the limitations characteristic of a description of phenomena ... that have philosophical significance, but also the constructive part of quantum mechanics and the new fundamental concepts connected with it.... The brilliant demonstration given by Bohr of the limitation of classical concepts is not accompanied by even the slightest indication of new concepts by which to replace them" (Fock's translation, AHQP). Similarly, Born claimed that science aims beyond mere coordination of measurement readings, that there is something ob- jective "behind the phenomena" (Born to Bohr, Jan. 28, AHQP). Unless one takes a realistic stand, one ". .. resigns oneself to answering any ques- 194</page><page sequence="13">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 195 tion about why one is investigating the word [sic] at all" (Born to Bohr, March 10, 1953, AHQP). Fock forcefully disagrees with Bohr's opinion about the quantum for- malism as being merely a tool for coordination of measurement readings. According to Fock, such a point of view is erroneous: "True enough, quantum mechanics (like any other physical theory) allows us, among other things, to coordinate the readings of the instruments used for the measurement, but that is not its fundamental importance. The purpose of a physical theory is always to describe the properties of physical objects in their relation to the outer world" (Fock to Bohr, Feb. 23, 1957, AHQP). Fock rejects Bohr's idiosyncratic stand that "mathematical symbols of quantum mechanics, in contradistinction to the mathematical symbols of classical physics, have no physical meaning in themselves" (ibid.). Fock did not see any difference in the role played by mathematics in classical and in quantum mechanics. The notion of "quantum state," or of quan- tum probability, are in fact fundamental quantum concepts. "They are not symbolic, but quite physical. There is no reason to avoid them in the description of nature" (ibid.).8 6. Appeal of Antirealism-Bohr's version. Antirealism in Bohr's philoso- phy was associated with the unfamiliar and "frightfully abstract" (a term Schrodinger used in his campaign against matrix mechanics) quantum mathematical formalism, not with the classical realm, known to every physicist. Bohr's presupposition of the proximity between commonsense notions and classical concepts, direct accessibility of classical reality to immediate sense perception, the need to use common and classical lan- guage for unambiguous communication, and the necessity of describing measuring apparatus using classical concepts all were advocated by Bohr as being self-evident truths rather than the controversial doctrines that they, in fact, were. Yet their appeal to experimental physicists was very strong. Born understood it clearly: "Every experimental physicist treats his instrumentation as if he were a naive realist. He takes its reality as given a priori, and doesn't rack his brains about it. Niels Bohr has made this at- titude the basis of his whole philosophy of physics" (Born 1962, 21). Born did not share Bohr's position, yet he understood its immense co- hesive potential. Thus, sometimes Born would endorse Bohr's radical split of the physical world in order to avoid the split in the world of physicists: "There has already developed a gap between pure and applied science and between the group of men devoted to the one or the other activity, a separation which may lead to a dangerous estrangement. Physics needs a unifying philosophy, expressible in ordinary language, to bridge this gulf between "reality" as thought of in practice and in the theory" (Born 1953, 8Similar criticism was recently provided in Krips 1987.</page><page sequence="14">MARA BELLER 151). The "plain", or "ordinary", language is the only language the expert can use for informing the wider audience of the new abstract technical advances: The physicist may be satisfied when he has the mathematical scheme and knows how to use it for the interpretation of the experiment. But he has to speak about his results also to non-physicists who will not be satisfied unless some explanation is given in plain language, un- derstandable to anybody. (Heisenberg 1958, 168) Heisenberg's writings are full of contradictions precisely because he si- multaneously addresses two "complementary" audiences, one of the lay- person and another of the mathematically initiated. Bohr's doctrine of the necessity of classical concepts worked wonders to alleviate the threat and anxiety connected with the symbolic quantum theory. His operational analysis of thought experiments was both a ther- apeutic compensation for the loss of Anschaulichkeit, and a crutch (Lon- don's term, Lande 1967), although a fragile one, to familiarize oneself with quantum mystery. Just how fragile the crutch was soon became apparent because of inconsistencies connected with Bohr's and Heisenberg's initial ideas of "disturbance" of atomic objects by observation-the notion Bohr eventually had to renounce. But even after its renunciation insoluble dif- ficulties remained (Beller and Fine 1994). Heisenberg grasped that oper- ational analysis of quantum phenomena by the use of classical terms ex- clusively cannot be contradiction free (Beller 1993). Other physicists expressed similar reservations in unpublished correspondence with Bohr (Bopp's letters to Bohr, AHQP). Yet in print not many dared, or cared, to enter into the territory that only Bohr, so the legend goes (Rosenfeld 1961, Blaedel 1988), mastered fully. 7. Antirealism and the Opposition. I have argued that scientific philoso- phizing in general, and philosophizing dealing with the realism-instru- mentalism issue in particular, is most fruitfully understood by juxtaposing the universal "must not" with the local "need not." By its very nature, the "need not" brings us to a specific historical situation, to local argument designed to dispose of the deeply entrenched but no longer useful habits of thought. While philosophically questionable, it is rhetorically wise to endow a local "need not" with universal validity. The attempts to mesh the different conceptual strands into a systematic position led to such philosophical hybrids, as Murdoch's characterization of Bohr as "instru- mentalistic realist" (Murdoch 1987, 222). It is not surprising that what is called the Copenhagen interpretation is so ridden with vacillations, about-faces and inconsistencies. For quantum philosophy-which was, more often than not, elaborated as the local re- 196</page><page sequence="15">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 197 sponse to the challenge of opposition, rather than as an attempt to construct a systematic framework-by the very nature of its development cannot be found contradiction free. Many of the antirealistic statements of the Co- penhagen camp came in direct response to Schrodinger's and Einstein's cri- tique of quantum theory. As the nature and the forcefulness of the oppo- sition's threat changed, different and often contradictory claims on the same issue appear in Bohr's, Heisenberg's, and Born's writings. Opinions about the "reality" of the T-function provide a prominent case in point. At the end of the 1920s, when Schrodinger, aiming at the elimination of "quantum jumps," attempted to substitute a wave model for the particulate Copenhagen-G6ttingen version, his efforts were dis- credited by the argument of 3 N-dimensionality of the wave-function. Be- cause of this multi-dimensionality, the T-function was presented as not something "real," but as an abstract notion, having a great mathematical utility, but no physical significance. These arguments that Schr6dinger's waves are not "real" because they ran in 3N-dimensional space were clearly targeted at those physicists who identified Anschaulich with "real" in the Neo-Kantian spirit. Such identification was clearly at odds with Heisenberg's and Born's sophisticated notions of "reality" as flowing from the features of mathematical model. Heisenberg and Jordan's pronouncements on the "lack of reality" of the '-functions exasperated Schrodinger. Yet, in vain he appealed to Born, who fully backed his younger colleagues on this issue (Beller 1990). Schr6dinger felt puzzled about the possible criteria of reality by which Born considered particles as "real," as opposed to the "abstract" wave- functions. Schr6dinger explained to Wien: "I believe that Born thereby overlooks that... it would depend on the taste of the observer which he now wishes to regard as real, the particle or the guiding field. There is certainly no criterion for reality if one does not want to say: the real is only the complex of sense impressions, all the rest are only pictures" (quoted in Moore 1989, 225). When the original challenge of Schr6dinger's interpretive attempts faded, Born changed his presentation of the significance of the '-function. In a lecture in 1950 Born stated: "What about the waves? Are they real and in what sense?... Though the wave-functions are representing, by their square, probabilities, they have a character of reality. That proba- bility has some kind of reality cannot be denied. How could, otherwise, a prediction based on probability calculus have any application to the real world?" (Born 1950, 106). Born concluded that "the scientist must be a realist" (ibid.), and that the abstract notions of mathematical formalism can-and must-be assigned a realistic significance: "He [the scientist- M.B.] uses ideas of very abstract kind, group theory in spaces of many or even infinitely many dimensions and things like that, but finally he has his</page><page sequence="16">MARA BELLER observational invariants representing real things with which he learns to operate like any craftsman with his wood or metal" (ibid.). Three years later Born's evaluation of the "reality" of T-function again underwent an about face. At that time, Schrodinger renewed his attack on the prevailing Copenhagen interpretation, and revived his old proposal of eliminating quantum discontinuities and "irrationalities" by an intui- tive wave-model (Schrodinger 1952). Born immediately responded with a counterattack (Born 1953) which was a repetition of a 35-year-old argu- ment against Schr6dinger: "A multi-dimensional wave function is nothing but a name for the abstract quantity P of the formalism, which by some of the modern theorists also goes under the more learned title of "state vector in the Hilbert space" (ibid., 143). Born repeats his strong commit- ment to the "reality" of particles as opposed to "waves." Thus, the em- phasis on "reality" or lack thereof can be understood properly only in the local context of a controversy; "realism" or "antirealism" regarding the same theoretical construction is often a rhetorical weapon, whose signifi- cance can only be grasped in definite sociohistorical circumstances. Attempting to present an "objective" definition of what is real, Born equated "real things" with invariants of observation and mathematical manipulation (Born 1928, 1964). He contrasted such scientific approach with that of a layman, for whom "the concept of reality is too much connected with emotions to allow a generally acceptable definition" (Born 1964, 103). Yet perhaps the difference between a layman and a quantum physicist in this respect is not so substantial as Born claims. For scientists, as for laymen, "the real things are those things which are important for them" (ibid.). 8. Appearance of Consensus and Conclusion. This paper can be viewed as a plea to fully acknowledge and explore contradictions in scientists' phil- osophical accounts. For it is precisely those claims that refuse to be neatly systematized that are perhaps most illuminating. Rather than to suppress contradictions as irritating nuisances, or charitably smooth them over, the contradictions should be fully exposed and analyzed. For they provide a most useful guide to the fascinating local context, so different from the "rational reconstruction" that ultimately serves the interests of the win- ning orthodoxy. The full acknowledgement of contradictions casts a heavy doubt on the very existence of the common basis of the "Copenhagen interpretation," and on the notion of the conceptual framework in general. The central pillars of the Copenhagen philosophy are indeterminism, wave-particle duality and the indispensability of the classical concepts. Yet none of them commands an unwavering commitment even from Bohr's closest collab- orators. Nor did they have unchanging and definite meaning for Bohr 198</page><page sequence="17">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 199 himself. As Born's and Pauli's correspondence discloses, they were aware that the bankruptcy of determinism cannot be compellingly deduced; nei- ther did Born and Heisenberg fully share Bohr's understanding of the wave-particle complementarity.9 Nor did Bohr's mathematically skilled colleagues share his dictum of indispensability of classical concepts, as I have argued. It is difficult to find any common denominator, any idea, commitment to which was not broken at one time or another. This is not to say that there was no consensus about radical departure necessitated by the quan- tum theory. It is the exact and consistent agreement about what would constitute such a departure that was lacking. The most general realization of the bankruptcy of the classical idea of motion was as fully grasped by the opponents, Schrbdinger and Einstein, as by the "orthodox" quantum physicists. It is true that Einstein had serious reservations about the quan- tum theory, and it is also true that Bohr and his followers were ready to accept the finality of quantum theory, no matter what far-reaching phil- osophical revisions it might imply. Yet finality is an ideological, and not a conceptual position, and this is perhaps the reason that the controversy so often looks like a political campaign where one discredits and caricatures the opponent rather than an open-minded dialogue over fundamentals. If this brief analysis is correct, then we have to face the question: how does an impression (an illusion) of an integrity, of solidity of the concep- tual framework, arise? By what rhetorical means are we led to believe that there is more stability in the views of a certain scientist, and more consen- sus between different participants, than is actually the case? The question about stability of the conceptual stand of a single individual is perhaps an easier one: for reasons of persuasiveness and credibility, scientists often present changing views as a natural elaboration of the previous position, rather than as a major change or an about-face. I have argued elsewhere that such substantial changes, unacknowledged by the authors, charac- terize Heisenberg's, Bohr's, Pauli's and Born's philosophical thought (Beller 1988, 1990, 1992). There is nothing distinctive here about quantum physicists-to give just one additional example, Newtonian scholars (Sha- piro, 1989) found that Newton, in his controversy over the nature of white 9"It would be silly and arrogant to deny any possibility of a return to determinism." (Born 1964, 108) For an exploration of Bohm's deterministic version, see Cushing 1994a and 1994b. Heisenberg, as he revealed in an interview with Kuhn, never liked the "dual" complemen- tarity approach. "We have one mathematical scheme that allows many 'transformations': The fact that we can use two kinds of words ['wave' and 'particle'-M.B.] is just an indication of the inadequacy of words." Interview with Kuhn on Feb. 25, 1963, AHQP. The opposition also lacked a coherent response. Fine (1993) argues that Einstein sub- scribed to three distinct kinds of interpretations of the quantum theory-subjective, instru- mental and hidden variables, thus utilizing considerable interpretive leeway.</page><page sequence="18">MARA BELLER light, similarly presented what was a forced departure from a previous stand as merely an elaboration of it. Perhaps a more intricate question is how the appearance of consensus between different participants is achieved. Here again the distinction be- tween "need not" and "must not" is helpful. Closely related to the issue of what one "need not" and "must not" do, is the question of what one "can" and what one "has to" do. Indiscrimination between them leads to a deceptive impression of firmer consensus between quantum physicists than actually existed. What Heisenberg and Born promoted as a possible epistemological stand, Bohr often advanced as an inevitable one. For Bohr the fact that one "can" describe the macroscopic measuring device by classical concepts was transformed into "has to," and into the doctrine of indispensability of classical concepts. In contrast, Heisenberg, more often than not, does not say that we "must" use the classical concepts; rather his claim is that we are "satisfied" to use classical concepts, or that we "feel entitled" to use them (Heisenberg 1958). Wave-particle complementarity is another prominent case in point. Bohr argued that one "has to" use both wave and particles in the quan- tum-mechanical description, presenting wave-particle complementarity as an epistemological necessity. Born and Heisenberg held that one "can" describe quantum-mechanical phenomena using both notions, and they often did so. Neither believed that one "has to" employ both wave and particles for a comprehensive description of every quantum phenomena, nor did Born and Heisenberg hold that these concepts are necessarily mu- tually exclusive. None was eager, of course, to publicize his disagreements with Bohr. In the early 1930's Born was quite lukewarm to Bohrian elaborations of complementarity. In 1929 Born claimed that the resolution of the wave- particle dilemma resulted first and foremost from Born's own statistical interpretation: "If we disregard all philosophical aspects, the contradiction between the corpuscular and wave properties of radiation would be in- soluble without this statistical viewpoint" (Born 1928, 34). Born's philo- sophical discussions in the 1930's are concerned with indeterminism and hardly mention complementarity. In the 1950's, the public image of phys- ics and the status of physicists underwent a drastic change, due to the use of the atomic bomb in Japan-the disaster that affected Born deeply (see the postscript of Restless Universe, reprinted in Born 1956). Born then embraced complementarity philosophy because of what he perceived as its peaceful reconciliatory message: "The world which is so ready to learn the means of mass-destruction from physics, would do better to accept the message of reconciliation contained in the philosophy of complementar- ity" (Born 1950, 108). Considering complementarity a "healthy doctrine," suitable to "remove many violent disputes in all ways of life" (Born 1950, 200</page><page sequence="19">THE RHETORIC OF ANTIREALISM AND THE COPENHAGEN SPIRIT 201 107), Born insisted that the real philosophical importance of quantum theory lies not "in the question of indeterminism, but in the possibility of several complementary perspectives or aspects in the description of the same phenomena" (Born 1954). My presentation of the antirealism in the interpretation of quantum physics distances itself from such notions as "belief," "commitment," and "metaphysical influence," and denies the very possibility of presenting the Copenhagen Interpretation as a coherent philosophical framework. What- ever cohesion the scientific paradigms or conceptual frameworks exhibit might have to do more with the integrity of the tools (mathematical, ex- perimental) rather than with "shared" metaphysical presuppositions.10 It would be presumptuous to argue for the abandonment of the category of the conceptual framework, of a "paradigm," or of a "research pro- gram," on the basis of the above analysis. Yet even the conclusions of such a limited case study are sufficient to serve as a warning to us from some methodological and historiographical pitfalls. We should beware from conflating "exposure to" (a certain viewpoint) with "influence," from hastily translating "familiarity" into "predisposition," and "predisposi- tion" into "commitment." This paper has dealt mostly with the rhetoric of antirealism, yet there is no intention of suggesting that realism is a more natural position than antirealism.11 The shifts, twists and about-faces concerning the issue of realism are no less frequent than on other philosophical issues. The point is not merely that it is exceedingly difficult to formulate a consistent frame- work even when one intends to do so.12 It is impossible to reconstruct a coherent philosophical framework from the multitude of utterances and deliberations which were aimed at meeting challenges in shifting scientific and sociopolitical circumstances.
