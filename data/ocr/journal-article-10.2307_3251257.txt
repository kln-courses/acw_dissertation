Sharply at odds with the historicist and pragmatist doctrines of the day, Tim- othy Bahti's Ends of the Lyric undertakes the formidable task of making general arguments about the theory of poetry. Bahti displays considerable critical acu- men in his willingness to work through the implications of interpretive diffi- culties without retreating into a logic of identity as soon as the analysis reaches a negative moment. Rather than celebrating the manifestation of mutually ex- clusive inferences as evidence of "paradox," "aporia," or "double bind," i.e., as the limit of discursive elaboration, Bahti takes such tensions as the starting points for his demonstrations. All the broader issues of interest to him-the articulation of poetics with hermeneutics, the implications of the theory of rhetoric for epistemology, a more precise characterization of the relationship between representation and reference-cannot be formalized, much less un- derstood, before the reversals, inversions, reversions, or most simply, the turn- ings that arise in his readings are themselves delimited as objects of inquiry. Insofar as the goal of the book is to show that this cannot be done in purely thematic, historical, or hermeneutic terms-hence, that it is essential to ad- dress the structural, tropological, and/or material facets of language-Ends speaks to the major methodological disputes in contemporary literary theory. At the same time, each of the main chapters is a detailed discussion of a dif- ferent major oeuvre, and it would not be wrong to view these discussions as eight independent contributions to their respective fields of scholarship, fields which rarely (for example, in the case of Leopardi and Celan) have much to do with one another. Ends is not, however, a compilation of disparate pieces. The essays which comprise the volume were composed over more than a decade, but the work is organized around a specific set of concerns, and Bahti takes some care to spell them out, discussing at length his presuppositions and goals, not to men- tion his reservations about his results. The major question to be asked of this study, then, may be whether its accounts of its readings actually do them jus- tice. The sense of coherence and interpretive integrity produced as the same MLN, 111 (1996): 1010-1053 ? 1996 by TheJohns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">M LN set of issues is tackled anew in poem after poem is compelling, but this strat- egy of presentation has its costs insofar as Bahti is at times forced to downplay the originality of his approach to particular authors for the sake of the vol- ume's overarching design. Ends of the Lyric considers questions of telos and (non) closure as it works to- wards a description of the specifically lyric "constituent" of literary language: "the structure of inversion that characterizes the way a poem directs its read- ing, and the way its directions towards its ends relate to their consequences of nonends" (228). Bahti is interested in how the potential incompatibility of hermeneutic and poetic analysis, coupled with the tendency of interpretation to shuttle unwittingly between the two, greatly complicates any consideration of poetry in terms of concepts or intuitions. Examining the failure of a phe- nomenal model of meaning to clarify the semantic complexities of the texts he reads, he argues that the insistent manifestation of inversion in the lyric cannot be understood as reduplication, repetition, or self-reference. It is in this context that he stresses that a tropological model of language is indis- pensable for any serious study of literature: "Literature is made up of tropes. Anyone who resists this knowledge should not be in the business of profes- sionally reading literature, any more than anyone who doesn't like wood should be in carpentry" (11). Given contemporary efforts to dispense with tex- tually-based modes of criticism, one can certainly sympathize with the thrust of the remark, but the presentation of the point is overly polemical. It would have been more useful to expound on the superiority of this model of lan- guage over others, or to discuss the delimitations of trope that have structured its exposition since antiquity, e.g., its difference from grammar or its contrast with the concept. Such suggestions do not in themselves constitute a criticism of Ends, for the readings of individual poems that follow do take up precisely these lines of analysis, and many others. But it is not without consequence that the study be- gins by keeping these more general considerations in the background and fo- cusing on chiasmus, the trope whose "uncanny recurrence" in lyric texts in- forms them to the point of defining them outright. Bahti himself expresses unease about claiming paradigmatic status for one trope in particular, and in the book's afterword, he goes to some lengths to show that chiasmus is scarcely the only form of inversion and by no means exhaustively accounts for the structure of lyric. This only makes its "provisional" centrality more puzzling, however. To identify chiasmus as a structure of inversion is in itself unre- markable, but it is odd to see a schema of closed exchange generalized as the grounds of poetic non-closure. In fact, Bahti is so effective at showing how in- stances of poetic inversion jeopardize both the identities of the terms involved and the ostensible vectors of their "reversals" or "crossings" that one is tempted to say that from the beginning his readings re-structure, if not explode, the chiasmus, to the point that it is not clear why we would speak about it in the first place. Ends, after all, does anything but remain within a linear model of 1011</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS progress and regress. Bahti's preoccupation with transition "through" a poem, with the question of how, as he puts it, a poem "gets" from beginning to mid- dle to end (and possibly back to the beginning) lays the grounds for his attempt to envision a model of semantic development (or more simply, alter- ation) that would not be organized around analogies between spatial or tem- poral determinants and syntactical structures. But the insistent reappearance of motifs from geometry or mechanics-images with which Bahti himself is the first to express discomfort, and which, interestingly enough, are usually in- voked to describe sets of possibilities rather than as figures of definitional or intuitional certitude-suggests that by not formulating the problem of trope in the broadest terms, Bahti risks determining his model of lyric as irreducibly phenomenal and threatens to allow his model of non-closure lapse into a ver- sion of plain old ambiguity. To some extent, the problem may be Bahti's willingness to let his terms op- erate simultaneously in different registers, as when he refers to chiasmus in the afterword as both the "material trope, constructed of and lodged in the poems' language, and the more speculative shape of crossing and inverting patterns of reading and understanding" (252). Given Ends' interest in re- thinking approaches to literary structure, one would have expected the bur- den of the analysis to lie in explaining the relationship between these two "senses" of the term chiasmus, rather than contenting itself with an unprob- lematized dichotomy. But this may be to miss the point. One of the major chal- lenges that the incidence of self-reflexivity in poetry poses to the critical pro- ject concerns the (re) insistence of homology, analogy, and continuity at moments when the "enlightened" reader would be more comfortable un- earthing disjunction and disharmony. As Bahti convincingly argues, lyric verse demands an understanding of representation that is not grounded in self- reference; otherwise, the basis for distinguishing between form and content evaporates and the poems are transformed into monolithic testimonies to the conceptual predominance of anthropomorphism. Lyric, the relentless cri- tique of any and every application of logical categories to poetic representa- tion, flirts with sacrificing the parameters in terms of which its own categori- cal identity could be called into question. This is why Bahti argues that lyric is always at once both too general a term-inexplicable in terms of particular generic boundaries, groupings of texts, or historical periods-and never generic enough-invariably reverting into a collection of traits which, as with his image of poetry as a space and temporality between a pure circularity and a pure linearity, can never be synthesized This is also why he argues that nei- ther lyric's material nor its conceptual power alone defines it, hence, that it must be considered as both sets of textual conditions and structures of mean- ingful intent. It turns out that by thinking about inversion rather than trope in the most general terms, Bahti goes far in explaining why no enumeration of the kinds of poetry, no matter how exhaustive, will ever tell us what poetry is, just as no definition of poetry will ever constitute a concrete prefiguration of the forms it will assume. 1012</page><page sequence="4">MLN Bahti's discussions of specific poems display an enviable combination of thoroughness and precision. The book's opening chapter on Shakespeare's sonnets sets the stage for much of what is to follow. Considering the limits of Joel Fineman's famous study, Bahti looks at the failure of the sonnet form to dictate a linear trajectory from line 1 to line 14. His argument is that it is only at the site of the breakdown of semantic and grammatical directives, at the col- lapse, as it were, of deictics, that it becomes possible to discern the shift be- tween modes of representation that takes place in the verse. By then treating this shift as the very evidence of poetic non-closure as such, Bahti is able to speak of the lyric as superseding a phenomenal mode of representation with- out immediately reincorporating it into an implicitly spatio-temporal set-up that would elide such a supersession before the fact. The demonstration is con- densed in the ironic lesson of Shakespeare's "see." A reading committed to do- ing something more than "seeing" whether it actually reads finds that the lyric's "retroping of its means" makes it impossible to align an understanding of reading with an account of a poem's "meaning" in terms of a beginning and an end, whether it is the beginning/end of the reading or of the poem. The grounds for affirming the incidence of poetic self-reflection thus become ei- ther so self-evident or so obscure that it is not obvious that it makes sense to conceive of them as determining of the poem's course at all. These problems are elaborated in Ends in a variety of ways, but the ensuing chapters can roughly be characterized in terms of two different (although hardly mutually exclusive) approaches. The first involves focusing on the idea of a "poetic word," a line of discussion that begins in the Shakespeare and Keats readings and becomes more explicit in the pieces on Baudelaire and Wallace Stevens. Here, Bahti elaborates a notion of linguistic concreteness which is to be opposed to the abstraction of meaning but at the same time fa- cilitate a concept of language about language. He does this partly by discussing particular lexical patterns (repetition at the level of the letter), partly by elu- cidating structures of self-reflection that take place not between words, but as modulations internal to them. The readings of Holderlin and Celan, the longest and most involved chapters of the book, are undertaken somewhat dif- ferently. Interrogating the elaborate matrices of images and motifs that riddle, even outright condition, these oeuvres, Bahti is primarily interested in how the poems' explicit mediations of their representations through structures of re- flection are at odds with their pretensions to realizing an apophantic mode. The tone of the argument is more cautious here than elsewhere. With re- peated deference to the poets' ingenuity in exploiting the grammatical and syntactic resources of the German language, Bahti only gradually moves to- wards more localized interpretive claims, so that, particularly in the Celan chapter, the formalizations are less frequent and the conclusions more provi- sional. At the same time, particularly in the Holderlin chapter, he devotes more attention to the important secondary literature, helping him to high- light the ingenuity of his own analyses, as well as to offer a sense of what work remains to be done. 1013</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS A project of such ambition will necessarily step on many toes. One can only hope that the difficulties of which it may inevitably run afoul do not obscure its lucid vision of what comparative literature could be. The Johns Hopkins University JAN MIESZKOWSKI Ronald Paulson, The Beautiful, Novel, and Strange: Aesthetics and Heterodoxy. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996. Throughout his career, Ronald Paulson has contested those disciplinary ten- dencies of literary and art historical studies that filter out the innovative vari- ety of eighteenth century British culture by sublimating it. Thus while Ian Watt uses the concept of "formal realism" to begin the story of the novel's rise with Defoe and Richardson, Paulson not only argues that Watt's theorizing of the novel renders Fielding unintelligible, Paulson's study of the intimate ex- change between satire and the novel resists the whole literary critical impulse to render "the" novel singular by defining it as realistic. Instead, Paulson demonstrates the mixed origins of British novels. Against the Continental bias of art history that marginalizes Hogarth as a brilliant English eccentric, Paul- son's three decades of publication on Hogarth demonstrate his centrality to British literary, artistic and popular culture. In his new book, The Beautiful, Novel, and Strange: Aesthetics and Heterodoxy, the polemical edge of this thesis is given its strongest formulation to date. Central to Paulson's story is a histori- cal claim: that between Shaftesbury's aesthetics for the man of taste oriented toward Beauty developed at the beginning of the century, and the aesthetics of the Sublime that takes hold by the end of the century (with Burke and Kant), Addison develops an aesthetics of the "New," the uncommon and the strange. This anti-idealist and realistic aesthetics of the "New" becomes the conceptual ground for the practice of Hogarth and Fielding. The historical insight and aesthetic values that Paulson attributes to William Hazlitt could equally well be applied to Paulson himself: "Hazlitt was perspi- cacious enough to recognize that if the eighteenth century in England was im- portant it was as a period in which theory fell far behind practice; in which the term 'high art' or 'canonical art' (with all of its civic humanist associations) was put seriously into question. It was a period noted chiefly for the emergence of new genres in both literature and graphic art based on material hitherto considered inappropriate for the serious poet or painter" (95). In order to contest the aesthetic impulse to elevate and refine culture-an impulse Paul- son ascribes to Shaftesbury, and his twentieth century apologistsJohn Barrell and David Solkin-and reintroduce the "inappropriate" cultural "material" their accounts filter out, Paulson redefines what aesthetics is and does. Rather than a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature and expression of beauty, or a systematic study of the psychological responses to beauty, aesthet- 1014</page></plain_text>
