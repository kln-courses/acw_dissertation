Unlike its main theoretical rivals, methodological and phenomenological individualism which take the individual and its consciousness as the fundamental units of analysis, and sys- tems theories which posit unitary, anthropomorphic structures with laws of their own, relational analysis takes social relationships and transactions as the starting-points of description and explanation. It follows that, in relational analysis, causation operates largely within the realm of interaction. For instance, political and legal institutions shape and transform the collective consciousness and disposition of social groups, while collective action shapes and transforms power structures and political-legal institutions. This article tries to shed light on one such patterned interaction, namely between the coercive apparatus of the Greek state and the labour movement in the period up to the outbreak of the second world war. It begins with an account of the legal environment within which the Greek labour movement operated, and then turns to a depiction of the dynamics of the coercion exercised by the police and the military. It ends with an effort to measure the actual physical coercion exercised, and to draw some conclusions about its underlying logic. The Legal Framework The legal environment within which labour movements operate can be con- ceptualized as comprising two distinct, albeit interrelated, spheres of civil law. The first, and more 'proximate', involves legislation regulating the status and function of trade unions. The rights embedded in this legislation, however, are Earlier versions of this article were presented at St Antony's College, Oxford, and Selwyn College, Cambridge.

This broader legal sphere sets the context and determines the limits within which the influence of trade union legislation is played out. A political environment that systematically constricts the freedom of expression of union activists renders any formally liberal trade union legislation (tolerating union formation, guaranteeing the right to strike, etc.) largely inoperative. No analysis of labour's political-legal space is com- plete, then, unless both legal spheres are taken into account. These will be briefly examined in turn. Trade Union Legislation: From Prohibition to Toleration to Prohibition Although the first labour associations which emerged in Greece during the last quarter of the nineteenth century were spared the traumatic experience of having to operate within the hostile legal environment prevailing in western Europe after the French Revolution (characterized by legislation such as the French Le Chapelier of 1791 and the British Combination Act of 1800), the legal status of labour associations remained unclear and their practical prerog- atives limited at least until the early 1910s. Though the Greek constitution of 1864 did not explicitly prohibit the founding of labour unions, it sanctioned only the operation of philanthropic and scientific associations, while the penal code considered going on strike a criminal offence.2 The formal aspects of this situation underwent a profound transformation with the advent of Venizelist liberalism, especially with the introduction of Law 281/1914 that regulated the unions' day-to-day functioning and legal pre- rogatives. By most accounts, 281/1914 represented an exceptionally liberal piece of legislation. Among other things, the law prohibited membership of both employers and workers in the same union, vested unions with the author- ity to engage in collective bargaining and sign collective agreements, and specified that no union could be dissolved for going on strike.3 Indeed, the argument has been put forward that Law 281/1914 signified the Greek manifestation of a pan-European process of transition from 'prohibition' to 'toleration' of unions. However, whereas in north-western Europe 'toleration' generally tended to be followed by 'recognition', the predominant tendency in Greece was to relapse into exclusionary 'prohibition'.4 The early Venizelist state was prepared to grant union autonomy but, 2 See R.

[It] would not actually tolerate the effective materialisation of ... class consciousness under the leadership of a revolutionary vanguard, which questioned the legitimacy of the existing social order and had as its goal radical socio- political transformation.' This, however, was not far from what actually tended to happen. For example, the Thessaloniki Labour Centre Venizelos helped to found in 1917 was captured by such a determined 'vanguard', while a year later the General Confederation of Labour (GSEE) adopted, at its founding Conference, the 'principles of class struggle'. In a similarly unsettling manner, the number of strikes increased, and so did worker militancy, especially after the Bolshevik revolution. Largely echoing the general mood of frustration and insecurity, one left-liberal Thessaloniki daily (the Ephemeris ton Valkanion) commented in its editorial of 23 July 1919: If [the workers] think that their demands can be advanced through the overthrow of the social order, a design prefaced by general strikes and other barbaric means, we ought to remind the state ... that labour unions have deviated from their legitimate goals, and have turned into anarchist and conspiratorial groups against the regime and the rule of the law. . ... Their dissolution is, therefore, an obligation of the state. In the circumstances, the state moved to curtail trade union freedoms. In 1918, the clause of the 1914 law according to which going on strike could not be a cause for dissolving a union was repealed, while in 1920 and 1921 three new constrictive pieces of legislation were introduced. Royal Decree of 15/20 May 1920, Law 2111 and Law 2151 placed obstacles on the ability of unions to go on strike, extended a strong regulatory arm into the unions' internal life, and raised barriers to the unions' ability to act in concert.6 Even this limited legal framework, however, was not assured. After the militant labour mobi- lizations of August 1923, the liberal government of Plastiras-Gonatas- Chadjikyriakos dissolved 'all the legally recognized and working labour corporations . . . or associations of such corporations', and confiscated their archives and treasuries.7 Though sobriety subsequently prevailed and the reso- lution was revoked in December, the symbolic and legal significance of the August Act remained momentous. By undertaking it, the state showed its resolve to crush the labour movement if deemed necessary sometime in the future, and set a concrete legal precedent for doing so.

All it took for this state of affairs to come about was Article 1 of the law, which penalized 'the implementation of ideas having as an ostensible goal the overthrow of the established regime by violent means'. Of course, the key term in this clause was 'ostensible'. Its astonishing vagueness gave judges great freedom of interpretation and effect- ively narrowed labour's political-legal space to the point of suffocation. Scores of unions and professional federations were dissolved on whim, and many of the most active union cadres were prosecuted. But the issues surrounding the Idionymon will be discussed later. As already argued, however, this restrictive trade union legislation acquired its significance against the background of a much broader set of legal rules determining the general political climate affecting labour. Analysis of this dimension of labour's environment also gives us the chance to consider the deep-seated reasons behind the state's restrictive preoccupations. Labour-Related Political Legislation: Whence the Restrictiveness? Political expediency prevailed over legality .... Legal security was traded off for the security of the state ... 8 The conspicuous incongruence between ultra-liberal constitutional form and oppressive, often blatantly unconstitutional, legislative practice characterizing Greek parliamentarism from its inception in the mid-nineteenth century is a common theme in modern Greek historiography and social science. In the interwar period, it took the form of the Republic's increasing failure to abide by the principles of its own constitutional framework, a deepening 'chasm between constitutional form and practice'.' Long before Metaxas toppled democracy in 1936, a host of dictatorial manifestations had already begun to divest Greek parliamentarism of much of its substantive content. This demo- cratic deficit was particularly felt by labour organizations. Ever since its emergence in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the Greek labour movement was faced with an extremely adverse political envi- ronment. Regulated by the Penal Code of 1834, acts of social protest were interchangeably perceived as instances of insolence, mutiny or conspiracy against the authority of the state, and were dealt with accordingly - through bloody suppression of the early mobilizations and persecution of the most militant activists. On the other hand, as long as the labour movement had yet to acquire either a definitive institutional expression or a noticeably 'perilous' dynamic, state persecution did not seem to take on a systematic character. The first traces of unconstitutional legislation restricting political freedoms can be found in Law 374 of February 1871, ostensibly introduced as a means 8 Aristovoulos Manessis, cited in Koundouros, op. cit., 13. 9 Alivizatos, op. cit., 34.</page><page sequence="5">Seferiades: Policing Labour in Interwor Greece 59 of curbing banditry.10 Not the least among its many controversial features was that it gave local civil and military authorities the right to order the banish- ment (or internal exile) of the bandits' relatives. What was mostly resented, however, was that the law was implemented at least as much to stifle political dissent as to fight crime. This legislation's political use became especially pronounced after the intro- duction of Law 121/1913, which sought to modify and extend it. Article 2 of the 1913 law stipulated that any person 'suspected of disturbing public order' could be sent to internal exile simply upon the recommendation of the respon- sible Prefect, the regional District Attorney, and the local Police Chief, i.e. without a trial. Among the people chiefly targeted by the clause were the socialists of the New Lands (Thessaly and Macedonia), at the time actively fomenting a strike wave and promoting the formation of a unified Labour Party." These unconstitutional practices reached their apex in the interwar years. The first breach of constitutional legality in the interwar period occurred in September 1922, when the government of General Plastiras imposed martial law, not in order to conduct war against a foreign power (as the pertinent legislation of 1912 - Law 1269 'regarding the state of siege' - specified), but to block royalist opposition. More crucially for our purposes, however, the state used its emergency powers bloodily to suppress the August 1923 strikes in Athens-Piraeus and other major urban centres. Once established in 1924, the Republic set about reforming the 1911 con- stitution in a more liberal direction. Yet its initial legislative acts, which also came to characterize the Republic as a whole, ran contrary to fundamental liberal principles. For instance, decrees introduced in 1924 promoted the notion of ante delictum 'crimes of opinion', and established special Com- mittees for Public Safety all over the country with the goal of enforcing the law. In January 1926, General Pangalos established his short-lived dictator- ship on the basis of this legislation. One of the features that set Pangalos apart from his predecessors was his specifically anti-labour preoccupations. His best-known measures once he was in power (June 1925) were the outlawing of the Communist Party (KKE), and the smashing of a number of militant front organizations of the peasantry/War Veterans and youth. In June 1926 a decree empowered the Committees for Public Safety to arrest and banish without trial persons suspected of activities which could harm civil peace and public safety. As a result, in the 13-month period until General Kondylis toppled the regime (August 1926), more than 1000 labour-political and union cadres were banished to various Aegean islands. 10 Ibid., 340-2. 11 The best-known case of the law's application was the banishment of trade unionists Benaroya and Yiona for their role in the Macedonia tobacco workers' strike of 1914. See A. Benaroya, The First Quest of the Greek Proletariat (Athens 1991) [in Greek], 83-5.</page><page sequence="6">60 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I Although Pangalos's fall naturally resulted in the release of most of his political prisoners, it did not lead to the repeal of his banishment legislation. In point of fact, this legislation outlived not only the dictator, but also the Republic, and the political system of Greece's first three post-second world war decades. Its legal core was not repealed until 1975. But even this extreme breach of liberal constitutional legality appeared innocuous compared to that perpetrated by Law 4229/25 July 1929, the Idionymon. Modelled on the Bismarckian Sozialistengesetz of 1879, this legis- lation was devised specifically to persecute the labour movement under the guise of an anti-communist crusade. As seen, Article 1 of the law penalized acts inspired by radical/revolutionary ideas. That such 'acts' were never defined, however, shifted judicial attention to the ideas behind the acts. And although the ideas were principally 'communist', they were also generally 'pro- labour'. It followed that any act whatsoever undertaken in such a pro-labour spirit, including such trifling actions as attending a union meeting, having a political conversation or even reading a newspaper, could be characterized as criminal offences. All those arrested for Idionymon crimes were brought to trial before crimi- nal courts without a jury, and faced fixed penalties of imprisonment for a period of between six months and five years plus internal banishment for up to two years. Between 1929 and 1936, almost 3000 labour activists were sent to internal exile, while more than 16,000 were arrested.12 In this political environment, trade union freedoms, to the extent that they were not formally revoked in the context of specific trade-union legislation, were rendered increasingly meaningless. As elsewhere in south-eastern Europe, the Greek workers saw that the defence of their trade union freedoms pre- supposed a struggle for broader political reforms. This helps to explain the labour movement's politicized discourse, ironically the feature which the country's socio-economic and political elites most wished to exorcize. This being so, the question obviously becomes: whence the Greek dlites' restrictive obsession? Attempting to answer this question also helps us to comprehend particular features of the labour movement. The task of explaining the interwar state's panoply of anti-labour legal measures (especially the Idionymon legislation) has naturally attracted con- siderable attention in modern Greek historiography and social science. For the most part, this has taken the form of an effort to account for the following paradox: since Greek communism remained electorally and organizationally weak throughout the interwar era, why was the Greek state so tenacious in repressing it? Generally speaking, most analysts have been quick to point out that the notion of a 'communist threat' (against which the Idionymon was ostensibly directed) is essentially a misnomer. What the state was really after in the inter- 12 Koundouros, op. cit., 93-4, 118-19.</page><page sequence="7">Seferiades: Policing Labour in Interwor Greece 61 war period was not 'communism' as such, but the workers' protest move- ment."3 The authors who have written most extensively on the subject have also recognized that the state's restrictive response principally reflected the socio-economic elites' limited reform propensity and, ultimately, the weakness of the socio-economic system. According to this view, the Idionymon was essentially an elite 'class response' in light of their perpetual inability (and unwillingness) to eradicate the deep-seated sources of socio-economic griev- ances, hence it was a dynamic response which reflected systemic weakness.14 At the same time, however, there also seems to be a scholarly consensus around the view that this repressive legislation represented an over-reaction by the state. It is argued that the legislation was the product of misguided panic in the period after the Bolshevik revolution and in the context of the ideological vacuum following the 1922 collapse of the irredentist Great Idea. The repres- sive panoply, continues the argument, was not really necessary. Indeed, it was both ineffective and costly, and ended up radicalizing the labour movement. That the 61ites operated under stressed conditions and that the Greek labour movement was indeed radicalized because of immoderate coercion are both undeniable. This, however, is one thing and implying (as is often done) either that the state acted on pure whim or that the labour movement owed its development to coercion quite another. Indeed, the extravagant fashion in which this argument is often patterned both runs contrary to recent social- movements theory (according to which, contracting 'political opportunities' generally cause movements to decline)," and raises important problems that make it potentially misleading. To start with, the argument contains a glaring internal contradiction. Where- as at one point the mobilizing capacity and radical dynamics of the labour 13 G. Mavrogordatos, Stillborn Republic: Social Coalitions and Party Strategies in Greece, 1922-1936 (Berkeley, CA/Los Angeles, CA/London 1983), 336, however, has interpreted the Idionymon as an instrument devised by Venizelism for 'purely electoral considerations'. Accordingly, the law was used 'in 1929-1932 for largely partisan purposes, namely to contain the erosion of Venizelist ... mass support against radical agitation of any kind ... [threatening to] irreparably cripple ... [it] as a project for bourgeois hegemony, as an interclass alliance, and, in the last analysis, as a governing coalition'. Compelling as it is, this view would obviously need to explain why the legislation received wide royalist support at the time of its introduction, and why the royalists made such extensive use of it after they came to power in 1933. 14 Koundouros, op. cit., 83-5; Alivizatos, op. cit., 379-80. But see L. Apostolakou, "'Greek" Workers and Communist "Others": The Contending Identities of Organized Labour in Greece, c. 1914-36', Journal of Contemporary History, 32, 3 (July 1997), 415-18, who argued that the KKE indeed threatened the established order in that it provided a contentious 'language field' running counter to the traditional stereotypes portraying Greek workers as industrious, thrifty, and law-abiding. Apostolakou's analysis is extremely elegant, yet the question remains: why was the State so worried about the prospects of militant discourse? 15 For a trenchant analysis of the 'political opportunities' problematique, see D.

This overly facile dismissal, however, does injustice both to the nature of the labour movement and to the powers of judgment of the state officials entrusted with the task of containing it. For, although the Greek labour movement clearly lacked the organizational prowess of its western European counterparts, it possessed a trait which made the job of the state officials at once more perplexing and precarious; namely, convulsive unpredictability. Time and again throughout the interwar era, these officials were baffled to see that the movement which they at times thought of as dissipated and finished, was able to stage remarkably militant comebacks usually in the form of neo-plebeian eruptions. Take, for instance, the events of August 1923. At the time, the movement was just coming out of a three-year-long period of acute organizational crisis with its historic leadership (both trade-union and political) largely discredited and its new, youthful leading members16 barely in place. This, however, did not keep it from exploding in a manner that caught everyone by surprise, caus- ing shock waves of anxiety among the officials concerned. A similar phe- nomenon occurred in 1928, a year marked by the militant mobilizations of the tobacco workers. As a labour movement veteran put it, 'at a time when every- body in the government and the elite circles thought that they had done away with the labour menace ... suddenly the storm broke out'.17 To be sure, at no time, either before or after the introduction of the Idionymon, did the labour movement pose a serious threat to the social regime. Unlike the situation in other parts of southern Europe (above all Spain and, to a lesser extent, Italy), Greece experienced neither a social revolution nor a genuinely revolutionary crisis during the interwar years. But the state officials could not possibly have known this beforehand. The tendency to discount the convulsive movement as insubstantial causes scholars to underestimate the bewildering nature of the choices the coercive apparatus had to make. After the 1923 explosion, for example, these officials did not know what form the next upsurge might take. They did not know what the social and political behaviour of the Asia Minor refugees would be,"8 or what trajectory the militant front 16 Largely recruited from the ranks of the war veterans and the Asia Minor refugees, this leader- ship was also the one to attempt the Socialist Workers' Party's organizational 'Bolshevization' (whereby the party was renamed 'communist' - KKE). It also launched the War Veterans' cam- paign which alarmed the British and American legations and, on the trade union front, applied the united front tactic with considerable success. As far as the youth of the cadres who composed it is concerned, in 1923 the Secretary-General of the party (Pantelis Pouliopoulos) was just 23, and the cadre in charge of the General Confederation of Labour (Seraphim Maximos, whom the British Legation mistakenly took to be a gifted Russian named Maximov), 24. 17 D. Livieratos, Social Struggles in Greece (1927-31). From Contempt on to a New Dawn (Athens 1987) [in Greek], 76. Similar eruptions took place in Volos (1921), Agrinion (1926), Kavala (1933), Heraclion (1935) and, above all, Thessaloniki (1936). 18 As Mavrogordatos (op. cit., 214) put it trenchantly: 'From the very beginning, what was most widely feared was not that the refugees might shift to Antivenizelism, but rather that they</page><page sequence="9">Seferiades: Policing Labour in Interwor Greece 63 organizations launched by the Communist Party would take. Their anxiety, in other words, was caused by not so much what was, as what might be. As K. Zavitsianos (the Minister of the Interior who introduced the Idionymon) put it in a speech to the parliament in May 1924: 'The movement which is observed in an as yet small class of workers and refugees, . . . [is one] which the Government must face seriously before it expands and brings the decomposi- tion and the chaos that it brought elsewhere.19 The thesis that state coerciveness did not merely signify misguided over- reaction by officials but was structurally engendered by the convulsive unpre- dictability of the labour movement, is also supported by the abrupt shifts in attitude displayed by many progressive politicians once they took power. While out of office they were critical of the coerciveness of their colleagues in government, when they became responsible for 'maintaining social order' their views changed dramatically. Take the case of Alexandros Papanastassiou, a politician who distinguished himself for preaching moderation both before and after his brief term as prime minister. In September 1924 he articulated the rationale behind his views: I do not think that ... communism is a possibility in Greece.... There is only one way that communism may come to pose a threat: when, under the pretext of suppressing it, we come to persecute all the working classes. On the contrary, satisfaction of the working classes' legitimate demands does not lead to communism, but buries it.20 During his four-month term as premier (24 March-25 July 1924), however, Papanastassiou was unable to break loose from coercive compulsion. Aside from the fact that he was the one to introduce the anti-constitutional Guarantor Decree and the legislation establishing Committees for Public Safety in April 1924, Papanastassiou also lost his composure on May Day 1924. He declared 1 May 'the Day of the Republic', banned the traditional rallies which had been organized by urban workers ever since the early 1890s, and condoned acts of police brutality against unauthorized demonstrators, leading to the death of one protester, the wounding of 26 others, and the arrest of approximately 100. Even more crucially, Papanastassiou spent large sums of money on strengthening yellow/employer unions in Macedonia.2' would swell the ranks of Communist subversion.' This fear was widely echoed internationally. In September 1924 the Greek correspondent for the Daily Herald wrote: 'The worker and peasant masses in Greece are not well-organized, so they cannot take advantage of the political weakness of the bourgeoisie. But under the influence of war, poverty, and the events in Russia and Bulgaria, these masses begin to rise up. . . . It will not be long before the peasants and the workers will unite with the refugees in the critical struggle against the crumbling bourgeoisie' (reproduced in the Ephemeris ton Valkanion, 24 September 1924). 19 Cited in Mavrogordatos (op. cit., 214). Similarly, Zavitsianos attacked those who main- tained that the poor electoral record of the KKE showed that there was no revolutionary danger: 'Do not count the left-wing votes; the number is much larger' (cited in Koundouros, op. cit., 79). 20 Interview in the Ephemeris ton Valkanion. 21 This was revealed in parliament by another liberal politician, Kafandaris. See Journal of Parliamentary Debates, 20 November 1924.</page><page sequence="10">64 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I But even the politicians who went down in history as prime champions of the coercive method, such as Pangalos and Kondylis, were well aware of the theoretical merits of moderation. For example, shortly before imposing his dictatorship in January 1926, Pangalos blasted the Michalakopoulos govern- ment for its 'undue coerciveness' during the rail workers' strike of March 1925, while Kondylis toppled Pangalos on a platform calling for an end to coercion and the 'restoration of popular freedoms'.22 That both politicians chose the opposite course once in power, however, was not accidental. State coerciveness and acerbic anti-labourism are difficult to understand if regarded as constituting defensive policies. Since the labour movement posed no real threat, repressing it so harshly indeed appears to have been both unnecessary and counterproductive. Our appraisal of the repressive policies is radically transformed, however, if we regard them as offensive and deterrent, seeking to raise the cost of participation in the activities of the labour move- ment and undercut its dynamic. Historians dislike the conditional narrative, usually for good reason. Yet it is important to place our analysis against the background of a hypothetical ques- tion: in light of the innate hostility of the socio-economic 6lites to meaningful reform, what would the evolution of the labour movement have been had the state abstained from systematically repressing it? Granted that no definitive answer can ever be given, it is nonetheless instructive to review briefly the views of the British legation on the prospects of the Greek labour movement as they were formulated during the 1920s. Their synchronic, policy-oriented sensi- tivities compelled British diplomats to formulate a number of contingent propositions. In the wake of the bloody showdown of August 1923, Ambassador Bentinck wrote in a dispatch: The Socialist Party steadily gained ground among the masses and increased its strength to such an extent that in 1919-20 the State, trying to break it up, found itself face to face with a strong organised party and the attempt ended in the further increase of the Socialists. ... The State should have struck hard at Communism by systematically attacking its leaders and by preventing the teaching of their principles among the workmen. But seeing that the prosecution of the men had only resulted in the opposite effect to what was aimed at, it left Communism free to work under the idea that Bolshevism was distasteful to Greeks and could therefore never seriously affect the people .... Thus in two years the Party had become a serious power in Greece. . . . As to the future of the Party, it seems probable that contrary to the opinion of the Greek authorities if Communism is allowed to go unchecked, it will become a serious danger to the State; the last strike showed the great strength of Communism though it failed because it had the misfortune to get up against the very compe- tent Government [of Plastiras-Gonatas] which now rules Greece instead of the weak-kneed Ministers who generally are in power and dare not strike for fear of losing votes....23 22 See his statement in the daily press of 22 August 1926. 23 Bentinck to Curzon, 5 September 1923 (FO 286/856; emphasis added). Of course, both in this and other dispatches, the real referent of 'communism' is what Bentinck elsewhere termed 'militant Trades Unionism' (as in his report of 24 July 1923, FO 371/8827).</page><page sequence="11">Seferiades: Policing Labour in Interwar Greece 65 Long after the defeat of the August strike, Bentinck still felt insecure. In his dis- patch of 31 October 1923 he complained that 'firstly the Government has not bolt [sic] its position sufficiently firm to act and only did so when forced into action over the strike, and secondly, when temporarily successful, did not follow up its success.... '24 Over a year later, at a time when the post-1922 cycle of labour contentious- ness had not yet begun to slow down, a new ambassador (Milne Cheetham) sent an appraisal of the situation that was every bit as alarmist as that of his predecessor: There has, during the last quarter, been a great increase of propaganda among all classes and an intense effort toward systematic organisation of the Communist forces with a view to revolutionary action. . . . The result of this energy has been . . . the growth of sympathy throughout Labour as a whole. The Communists are, in fact, beginning to be regarded as the sole champions of the working classes against the employers. . . . Against all this activity the Government programme seems to consist principally of talk. General Kondylis did indeed start some form of Fascist movement of his own in Macedonia, but recent revelations as to its activities in that province have considerably disgusted the average Greek mind. The net result is that Communism is gaining ground in every way and making great efforts to fit itself to play its part in Greece when orders come from Moscow for a general Balkan upheaval.21 Of course, Cheetham was wrong on nearly all counts. Neither was a com- munist upheaval in the offing, nor did government action consist of mere talk. The value of his dispatch, however, lies in his warning of bad things that might have happened had the state adopted a passive stance. In so doing, he implicitly recommended to the Greek state that further coercive measures against labour needed to be taken if the possibility of a new upsurge were to be averted. To his satisfaction, such measures were indeed taken, first by Michalakopoulos and then by Pangalos. In March 1925, the ambassador wrote in a dispatch: The Hellenic Government seem now to be fully active to the importance of the question of Communism, and they are meditating the enforcement of serious drastic measures, intended to suppress, or, at any rate, seriously to check the spread of the movement. . . . The Government of M. Michalakopoulos, especially with General Kondylis as Minister of the Interior, may be trusted to deal adequately with . . . open manifestations of Communist activity.....6 As anticipated, these measures also bore fruit. The Annual Report for 1925 of the British Legation took note of the fact: It seems justifiable to conclude on the evidence available that, not withstanding appearances to the contrary, the Greek Communist movement has made no serious advance during the past year. The repressive measures of the Michalakopoulos and Pangalos Governments are known to have disorganized the party by removing many leaders and diminishing whatever confidence Moscow might have had in its values."27 24 FO 286/856. 25 Cheetham to Chamberlain, 11 December 1924, FO 371/9891. 26 Cheetham to Chamberlain, 16 March 1925, FO 286/920. 27 Annual Report of the British Legation, 1925, 26, FO 286/950; emphasis added.</page><page sequence="12">66 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I British views in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the labour movement managed to overcome the paralysis of the mid-1920s and begin a new offen- sive, were similar. Though the 'fear of Moscow' had subsided somewhat, the convulsiveness of the movement continued to concern contemporary observers and policy-makers. As Ambassador Ramsay put it in a 1931 dispatch, a 'firm attitude' was the state's best bet, for whenever such had been used, it had 'proved effective'.2" To sum up, far from being haphazard or senseless, the coercive conduct of the state appears to have been both well calculated and effective in under- mining the labour movement's contentious dynamic. Indeed, it seems to have been an organic expression of the weak socio-economic system as a whole, characterized by the limited reform propensity of the Greek dlites. In that sense coercion was necessary. Having so far explored the legal framework and mechanics of state coer- cion, it is necessary to examine it in practice. For, narrow as the political-legal space may have been, the zeal of the coercive apparatus often made it appear even more constrictive to labour movement activists. The Trajectory of Physical Violence and Institutional Tampering The Nature of the Problem and Statistical Findings To this day, the topic of actual state coercion has yet to receive the systematic attention it deserves in modern Greek historiography and social science. The unfortunate repercussions of this lacuna are only too obvious. Limited know- ledge of the frequency and intensity of coercive attacks hampers our under- standing of the interwar social environment. If one overlooks the regular incidence of injuries and killings of labour militants, it is easy to come up with idyllic notions portraying Greece as a classless land of cheerful familialism, typical of many traditional - but also postmodern - renderings. In an effort partially to overcome this historiographic lacuna, I have attempted a preliminary charting and measurement of coercive instances occurring during labour movement mobilizations (i.e. in ascending order of contentiousness, rallies, marches/demonstrations, strikes, sit-down strikes, riots and rebellions).2 By operationalizing 'coercion' as the 'use of violence by the coercive apparatus of the state (gendarmerie/police, army) against one or more individuals participating in labour movement mobilizations', I have identified five categories of coercive phenomena. In ascending order of co- ercive gravity, dynamic dispersals of labour mobilizations, arrests, injuries, killings and mass killings (involving the indiscriminate killing of more than 28 Ramsay to Henderson, 9 March 1931, FO 286/1105/204. 29 This measurement exercise is part of a larger project on the quantification of labour mili- tancy in interwar Greece, and relies on a data base of labour mobilizations and coercive occur- rences constructed from (a) daily press reports, (b) archival material and (c) secondary sources.</page><page sequence="13">Seferiades: Policing Labour in Interwar Greece 67 TABLE 1 Coercive instances in interwar Greece (1919-36) Coercive Mass Year incidentsa Dispersals Arrests Injuries Killings killings 1919 7 6 4 - - - 1920 5 4 4 3 - - 1921 17 17 13 1 - - 1922 6 6 4 2 - - 1923 8 8 5 2 - 1 1924 26 25 22 6 4 - 1925 20 20 11 6 - 1 1926 6 6 3 2 2 - 1927 18 18 7 5 3 - 1928 35 35 18 11 1 1 1929 28 28 16 17 3 - 1930 31 31 17 8 1 - 1931 49 49 20 11 1 - 1932 51 48 18 14 6 - 1933 29 28 11 11 3 1 1934 46 43 14 12 3 2 1935 22 22 9 10 3 2 1936 79 78 37 36 3 1 Total 483 472 233 157 33 9 a 'Coercive incidents' are typically composite phenomena, involving simultaneously more than one coercive form. Hence the figures in the first column indicate the number of labour movement mobilizations assaulted by the coercive apparatus and not the sum of coercive forms occurring during each year. four individuals on one occasion). The results of this charting of coercive instances appear in Table 1. Map 1 gives us a glimpse of the regional distribu- tion of the most serious coercive instances, i.e. killings and mass killings. My quantification of coercive instances is done by means of three indices, measuring for each year of the 1919-36 period (a) the total coercion exercised (Cumulative Index of Coercion - CIC);30 (b) the frequency of coercive occur- rences as a percentage of the total number of movement mobilizations (Index of Coercive Incidence - ICI); and (c) the average intensity of these occur- rences (Index of Average Coerciveness - IAC). Figure 1 depicts the evolution of the Cumulative Index of Coercion and Table 2 the evolution of the indices of Coercive Incidence and Average Coerciveness. For purposes of clarity, the Index of Average Coerciveness figures are also 'translated' back into the lin- guistic terms from which they emanate (the device permitting this translation is the coercion measurement scale, against which the IAC scores acquire their meaning). According to these calculations, between 1919 and 1936, over one 30 The operational definitions and the ordinal values assigned to each coercive instance appear in the Appendix.</page><page sequence="14">68 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I MAP 1 Killings and mass killings in interwar Greece: an impression Mass killings Killings 10 killings FIGURE 1 Trajectory of cumulative coercion in interwar Greece (1919-36) CICnoints 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 1919 1920 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 Year</page><page sequence="15">Seferiades: Policing Labour in Interwar Greece 69 TABLE 2 Coercive frequency and average coerciveness (1919-36)* Index of average coerciveness Index of coercive incidence Numerical Equivalence to coercive Year (as a % of mobilizations) figures instances 1919 10 2.0 (Arrest) 1920 10 4.8 (Injury-Killing) 1921 27 2.8 (Arrest-Injury) 1922 19 3.7 (Injury-Arrest) 1923 9 4.3 (Injury-Killing) 1924 22 4.5 (Injury-Killing) 1925 29 3.7 (Injury-Arrest) 1926 19 5.3 (Killing-Injury) 1927 30 3.9 (Injury-Arrest) 1928 45 3.7 (Injury-Arrest) 1929 36 5.2 (Killing-Inj ury) 1930 31 3.3 (Injury-Arrest) 1931 43 2.8 (Arrest-Injury) 1932 47 3.5 (Injury-Arrest) 1933 28 4.1 (Injury-Killing) 1934 23 3.5 (Injury-Arrest) 1935 20 5.1 (Killing-Injury) 1936 18 4.1 (Injury-Killing) Average 25.5 3.8 (Injury-Killing) * Italicized figures indicate a value above average quarter of labour mobilizations became the target of coercive assaults by the security apparatus, of an average intensity approximating the coerciveness involved in 'injury'. Of course, physical coercion in interwar Greece involved a much broader array of phenomena than those captured by my operationalization and numeri- cal indices. For instance, the measurement is blind to phenomena occurring outside movement mobilizations (firing of workers for political reasons, black- bullying, unprovoked arrests of unionists on the street or in their union head- quarters, etc.). Nor, of course, does it detect phenomena involving the private sphere (individual torture, personal threats, etc.). Nevertheless, the figures allow us significant mileage toward detecting the logic underlying this coercive practice and the main factors responsible for the particular forms it took. The Dynamics of State Coercion (1919-36) The principal agency on which the state relied for the application of its coercive project was the gendarmerie.3 At the onset of the interwar period, 31 Originally founded in 1833 as a special branch of the military, the gendarmerie was also responsible for policing towns. For a concise account of its evolution, see N. Mantzouranis, A Concise History of the Greek Royal Gendarmerie (Athens 1970) [in Greek].</page><page sequence="16">70 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I however, this body was found desperately lacking in terms of functional specialization. Still a quasi-military body, 'whose strength of force was not fixed, but fluctuated from day to day according to military exigencies',32 it was clearly unprepared to face up to the challenges of a new era. Recognizing this, the Greek government turned to the British for counselling and practical assistance, and they responded by sending a team of officers, the so-called British Police Mission (BPM), with the task of thoroughly reorganizing the security apparatus. Operating on Greek soil from late 1918, the BPM set up a Towns Police (TP) in 1920, and founded a Police Academy in Corfu, the largest of its kind in the Balkans. But by far the most important agency the BPM established was the Special Security Service (YEA, founded in 1925), which was assigned the responsibility of gathering intelligence and monitoring the activities of the labour movement." For this purpose, the YEA set up networks of informers all over Greece (mostly recruited from the underworld but, increasingly, also from within the ranks of the labour movement) and built working relations with the gendarmerie and the military.3" Whenever it was deemed necessary, gendarmerie and military units were called in to ensure the maintenance of public order. But how was this apparatus deployed? The forcefulness with which the Greek labour movement entered the inter- war era caught the Venizelist state by surprise. Alarmed by the founding of the Socialist Workers' Party (SEKE, November 1918), commonly perceived to be 'composed of genuine Greek Bolsheviks', and the capturing of the General Confederation of Labour (GSEE, also founded in November 1918) by the socialists, Venizelism immediately dropped its erstwhile pro-labour pretences and turned to an assault on both organizations. Throughout 1919-20, the SEKE kept receiving 'blood-curdling threats' from the authorities," while in July 1919 the GSEE experienced the first of what was to be a long series of blunt state interventions in the workings of the trade union movement. The five socialist members of its executive committee were arrested and sentenced to internal exile. This, plus a number of other, lesser cases of tampering with 32 The quotation is from the dispatch of the British ambassador, 25 January 1927 (FO 286/1009). 33 The YEA functioned initially under the auspices of the TP. Under the Pangalos dictatorship, however, its operation was suspended by the military service-styled General Security of State Service (YGAK), 'and peremptory orders were issued by the Dictatorial Government not only to detach the then existing personnel engaged in the TP YEA ... to the [YGAK], but also to detach a great number of additional TP officers and men to that Service. . . . When the Dictatorial Government of General Pangalos was overthrown, the . . . [YGAK] was abolished and a new military Service-styled "State Defence Service" was substituted' (Dispatch of 25 January 1927, FO 286/1009). For a detailed account of the various forms the YEA took in the interwar period, see A. Dagas, The Hafyie: The State against Communism.

As the figures in Table 2 illustrate, the way the coercive apparatus initially responded to the challenge of containing the labour movement was by recourse to 'police brutality'. Five of the eight years in which the coercive intensity (IAC) displayed in handling labour mobilizations exceeded its interwar average, were before 1928. State coercion also involved numerous unprovoked arrests, which even though usually lasting for only a few days or hours, typically involved the vicious beating and humiliation of the union members arrested. The overall mentality of the gendarmerie during this period is nicely captured in the admo- nitions made by police chief Karagounis to the men of the Fifth Thessaloniki Precinct: You are not to bring in these Bolsheviks in front of me in one piece, but badly beaten up. ... I want them mutilated. This precinct ought to become the workers' graveyard.... All the workers will fall in front of me like corpses.36 Several mutually reinforcing factors combined to produce this violent con- duct. Before 1925 (the year when the YEA was founded), the state possessed little or no reliable intelligence on the activities and organizational structures of the labour movement, and this intensified the authorities' apprehension about its dynamic, especially after the Bolshevik victory in Russia. This strain was further reinforced by the coercive apparatus's limited manpower, which kept it from taking on as many labour mobilizations as was deemed necessary. Because the state's coercive stick was still small, so to speak, an effort was made to compensate for its deficiency by hitting as hard as possible. Finally, increased brutality was also the prescription of the British legation. As seen in some of the dispatches cited above, the British were worried that the Greek state had actually underestimated the 'red menace'. On the other hand, the British (and most far-sighted Greek policy-makers) were quick to point out from as early as 1920, that a 'simple policy of repres- sion [could not] be indefinitely maintained'.37 Such a policy of sheer violence obviously ran the risk of dangerously embittering the workers, so it had to be supplemented by institutional tampering and other, less visible, forms of coercion. One such form was 'yellow', or 'employer unionism', which was launched in 1919-20 in the tobacco-producing regions of Macedonia and Thrace under the quasi-official protection of the police.3" Another consisted in the formation 36 Ephemeris ton Valkanion, 20 March 1921. Note Karagounis's synonymous use of 'Bolsheviks' and 'workers'. 37 Lord Granville, 25 March 1920, FO 286/744. 38 In a dispatch of 1 August 1923, the British Consul of Thessaloniki explained that yellow unionism's first appearance occurred in Kavala after the defeat of the local tobacco strikes in 1919 and 1920 that were led by the mass union Eudaemonia [Prosperity]: 'At the end of the last strike</page><page sequence="18">72 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I and covert support of proto-fascist gangs, first in the form of Prince Nicholas's (King Constantine's brother) Youth of Macedonia (1922), and later in that of General Kondylis's Hunter Battalions (1924). Yet the extreme crudeness of both the early yellow unions and the proto-fascist bands severely limited their effectiveness. Their low membership was recruited almost exclusively from the underworld, and their discourse was so explicitly anti-labour (pledging loyalty to employers and the state),39 that it produced results opposite to those intended. The 'yellow' project started becoming more sophisticated after 1924, when the state stopped backing criminal types and started recruiting actual labour leaders in the context of an incipient anti-communist crusade. The year 1925 thus witnessed a series of coups inside major trade unions, federations and labour centres,40 and in 1926 the GSEE was captured by a reformist-yellow coalition in the Third Congress of the confederation that took place in March- April. During the period leading up to this critical congress, the Pangalist state fomented the creation of a new wave of yellow unions (ironically called the Unifying Wing),41 intensified its regular repression of leading unionists and hindered the holding of union assemblies for the election of delegates to the congress. Last but not least, a number of left-wing delegates were arrested on their way to the congress. Even more crucially, however, in 1926-27 the restructuring that the coer- cive apparatus had been undergoing since 1918-19 finally started to bear fruit. The gendarmerie no longer faced the previously acute problem of deficient the Eudaemonia chest was empty. The Merchants' Commission then took advantage of the ensuing dissensions to promote the rival club the Erghasia [Labour] which has branches at Xanthi, Pravion, Drama, Serres, and Thessaloniki and is simply anti-communist' (FO 286/858). 39 For instance, one leading cadre of the Youth of Macedonia was a 'noted criminal [released] while doing sentence for several murders' (unsigned dispatch, 20 February 1922; FO 286/826). Similar was the make-up of most of the yellow leaders. As far as their discourse is concerned, the programmatic statements of the New Association, a yellow union emerging in the Thessaloniki tramways, is quite typical: 'The task of our association is the defence of the state, of Society and of the Company, in the hope that the latter will reward our labours' (Ephemeris ton Valkanion, 28 May 1922). 40 Such coups occurred in the Thessaloniki and Athens labour centres of the Greek Tobacco Workers' Federation (KOE), and the Thessaloniki railroad workers' union (see Ephemeris ton Valkanion, 20 March, and 10, 18, 31 August 1925; Athens Local Committee of the KKE, Report for the Period 2 April-1 November 1926; Comintern Archives/Greek Section). 41 That these unions never managed to recruit more than a handful of workers did not prevent them from having an important impact on the congress, thanks to a clause in the GSEE con- stitution which allotted the same number of delegates to unions of 30 and those of 500 (Liakos, op. cit., 113). Moreover, it was later revealed that a great many of the yellow delegates had been bribed. See, e.g., the account of Kandylas, a tobacco delegate from the Kavala yellow union Erghasia, who in a letter to the Ephemeris ton Valkanion (2 June 1927) gave details about a fight that took place among Erghasia delegates for the distribution of the bribe money. In its issue of 12 September 1931, the Ephemeris ton Valkanion also revealed that the government had paid for the round-trip tickets to Athens (where the congress was held) 'of scores of delegates of non-existing unions that it considered to be of its own'.</page><page sequence="19">Seferiades: Policing Labour in Interwar Greece 73 organization and manning, while the YEA managed to establish a network of informers in all the major centres of labour activity. In May 1927, the intelli- gence gathered by informer 'Erimias' led to the busting of the Thessaloniki organization of the KKE and, through that, the nearly complete liquidation of the party organizations in central and western Macedonia.42 According to a report submitted by the KKE District Committee of Eastern Macedonia- Thrace to the Central Committee on 30 March 1928, the prevalent mood among the party membership in the various towns within its jurisdiction was one of 'hafyie-phobia', informer phobia: 'Each member suspected the others, and as a result . .. it has been impossible to convene a meeting.'43 The structural enhancement of the coercive apparatus was also evident in the spectacularly increased coercive incidence during mobilizations. As can be seen from the figures in Table 2, whereas in 1919-26 the average percentage of mobilizations assaulted by the police was 18, in 1927-33 it jumped to 37.1. In 1928, 1931 and 1932 nearly half the labour mobilizations were attacked by police. One might expect that the increased capacity of the coercive apparatus to take on the workers' movement in such a great percentage of its mobilizations, along with its first-hand knowledge of labour's many organizational imperfec- tions, would have led to an attenuation of police brutality. After all, the main idea behind institutional tampering and day-to-day surveillance of labour organizations was precisely to avoid inordinate violence threatening to embit- ter the workers. And yet, no such attenuation materialized. The figures in Table 2 indicate that whereas the average IAC for the period 1919-26 was 3.9, in 1927-33 it had fallen only slightly, to 3.8. Both figures signify an average coercive intensity approximating injury. Moreover, as can be seen in Table 1, an overwhelming 94.3 per cent of injuries and 72.7 per cent of killings during mobilizations occurred after 1927. What accounts for this resilience of police brutality? Providing a definitive answer is quite difficult, especially in light of labour's organizational weakness after 1928. The Fourth Congress of the GSEE, held in May 1928, expelled all the communist-affiliated unions, which responded by forming, in February 1929, a 'Third Periodist' rival, the Unitary General Confederation of Greek Labour (EGSEE). The EGSEE's main preoccupation, however, was not unity but the waging of a vitriolic campaign against 'social- fascism' (i.e. yellow and reformist GSEE unions) which, of course, was not left unanswered. As if all this infighting were not enough, the Fifth Congress of the GSEE, held in September 1930, resulted in yet another split. The yellows crowded out the left-reformists, and the latter established their own confeder- ation, the Independent Trades Unions (AES). The three-way split was rapidly reproduced in all the major federations, labour centres and even unions, and predictably had a paralyzing effect on the workers' morale and mobilizing 42 Dagas, op. cit., passim. 43 Comintern Archives/Greek Section.</page><page sequence="20">74 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I capacity. In the period after 1928 the labour movement seemed to be literally on the verge of organizational collapse. What this situation would seem to indicate, then, is that the state decided that 1929-32 was a good time to annihilate the labour movement by deliver- ing what it was hoped would be a 'final blow'. The result was an orgy of arrests, often 'for ridiculous reasons',44 a new boom in internal banishments (reaching a peak in 1932), and an intensification of raids upon union buildings by the police and a new breed of fascists, the Thessaloniki-based National Union 'Hellas' (EEE), reported to have reached a membership of 7000 in 1931.41 That the post-1928 effort to dissolve the labour movement was unsuccessful caused the state to combine increased coercive frequency with increased coercive intensity in the triennium 1933-36. Tables 1 and 2 reflect this quite clearly with respect to coercive intensity. Each and every year in the 1933-36 period was marked by both killings and mass killings, whilst average coercive- ness was above the level of injury (i.e. above 4) in 1933, 1935 and 1936. Doubt may persist, however, with respect to the actual increase of coercive incidence. Table 2 (which records the percentage of mobilizations assaulted by the security apparatus) indicates a reduced coercive incidence for 1934-36 (average: 20.3 per cent), only slightly above the average for 1919-26 (18 per cent), and far below that for 1927-33 (37.1 per cent). Before passing any definitive judgment, however, we also need to take into account the absolute number of coercive incidents (appearing in the second column of Table 1). Doing so leaves no doubt whatsoever regarding the reality of increased coer- cive presence by the state. While the average number of such assaults was 11.9 in 1919-26 and 34.4 in 1927-33, in 1934-36 it jumped to 49. Of course, the point in citing these figures is not numerical precision. All that my measuring project aspires to accomplish is to disclose fundamental trends, in turn helping us to pose crucial questions and identify concealed dynamic phenomena. And the most interesting phenomenon revealed here is the marked divergence between coercive incidence as such and coercive inci- dence as a percentage of the total number of labour mobilizations. The former 44 Ramsay to Henderson, 16 July 1931, FO 286/1104/165. 45 Mavrogordatos, op. cit., 255. Ostensibly operating on their own initiative since their found- ing in 1927, the EEE were fully sanctioned by the Liberal state. The inauguration ceremony of their Thessaloniki headquarters, for instance, was attended by the Governor-General of Macedonia, the Minister of Welfare (who addressed the participants as 'my lads'), the commander of the locally-stationed Third Corps, and the usual assortment of high-ranking priests (see Ephemeris ton Valkanion, 4 January 1931). In the footsteps of their European counterparts, the EEE-ites held provocative parades in military uniform, 'the younger ones in shorts, the elder ones wearing steel helmets' (British Consul-General of Thessaloniki, 20 April 1933, FO 286/1118/131), and attacked Jews and labour events.

What does this divergence tell us? Simply, that although the gendarmerie and army attempted to tighten their control over labour, the latter's intensified contentiousness of 1934-36 overwhelmed the attempt. To put it simply, the volume of mobilizations was simply too large to suppress. Suffice it to remark that whereas the average number of mobilizations in 1919-26 was 64.4, it reached 91.7 in 1927-33 and exploded up to 246.7 in 1934-36. Having failed to eradicate the labour movement when it was organization- ally weak in 1928-32, by 1936 the state faced serious problems in checking it. Coercion was apparently not enough, yet it was the sole means the state had at its disposal, though likely to intensify labour militancy and hence render the task of containing the labour movement even more difficult, especially in the medium-long term. Among other things, the dictatorship of 4 August 1936 offered a way out of this frustrating strategic dilemma by banning the labour movement. This last assault was also the most coercive. APPENDIX Operational definitions and measurements The ordinal numerical scale submitted below is constructed per differentiam of the genus 'coercion', in turn defined as the use of violence by the coercive apparatus of the state (police, army) against one or more individuals partici- pating in labour movement mobilizations. In turn, the operational definition of 'violence' employed is any use of physical force calculated to do harm to one or more individuals (participating in a movement mobilization). On the basis of the different degrees of violence they involve, I identify five crucial types of coercive phenomena (coercive instances), in interwar Greece. Their respective operational definitions are as follows: Dynamic Dispersals: The police (or army) act of breaking up labour indoor or outdoor meetings and rallies or of intercepting/blocking marches without making arrests and without inflicting injury or causing death. A dynamic dispersal is assumed whenever clashes involving the participants of a labour mobilization and the police are reported. Arrests: The police act of arresting and detaining (even for brief periods) one or more individuals for participating in any movement mobilization. Injuries: The police (or army) act of injuring one or more individuals in clash- es occurring in the context of any movement mobilization. Killings: The police (or army) act of killing one or more (cut-off point: four) individuals in clashes it has with them in the context of any movement mobilization. Mass Killings: The police (or army) act of indiscriminately killing more than four individuals participating in any movement mobilization (ideally, any police intention and practical preparation to do so).</page><page sequence="22">76 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I As stated, the dimension along which the different types of coercive phe- nomena are identified, ordered and scaled (graded) is 'violence', in practice, 'different amounts of violence'. The more the violence involved in a given coercive instance, the higher the numerical value ascribed to it. If we picture a coercion continuum ranging from 'less violence' (left-hand side) to 'more vio- lence' (right-hand side), the higher the value ascribed to any given coercive activity, the more it is found toward the right-hand end of the continuum. Accordingly, I am proposing the following interval numerical ordination: Coercive phenomena charted and ordinal values assigned Dynamic Mass dispersals Arrests Injuries Killings killings [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Less violence More violence Scaling rationale Dispersals not involving arrests, injury or death receive the lowest value ([1]), principally because of their progressively unexceptional (non-emergency) char- acter in interwar Greece. No matter what the type of movement mobilization (indoor meeting, outdoor rally, peaceful or more militant demonstration, etc.), the likelihood was that the police would be there to disperse it. Particularly during the KKE's Third Periodist phase (1928-34), when the party missed no opportunity to summon a few hundreds to 'mass political rallies', 'dispersals' would occur, the nature of which would - arguably - not even warrant them inclusion in the genus 'coercion'.46 These are not graded (and, for purposes of compiling a coercion index, not counted). The ones remaining were, to be sure, violent; but less so than the rest of the instances, particularly those involving injury or death. A value of [2] is ascribed to 'arrests'. It may be objected that an arrest, understood as placing someone under custody, does not necessarily involve physical violence. Formally speaking, this may be so. But in reality, arrests of labour activists were violent events indeed; not so much on account of how 46 To this day, movement veterans recount an anecdote about such a KKE rally in the early 1930s that was to take place at the centre of Athens one evening at 7.30. Among the first to arrive was the subsequent leader of the resistance movement, Aris Velouchiotis (a wartime alias for his real name, Thanassis Klaras), at the time a young party cadre. About 80 had shown up, the day's Rizospastis (the party daily) neatly folded in their back pockets, when the police appeared. The familiar stage had now been set: the delivery of the speech would begin, then the police would attack. Everything was ready but for one detail, the speaker was missing! It was already 8.45 pm and people were beginning to get nervous. Finally, the constable in charge of the gendarmerie detachment approached Klaras and told him: 'What is the matter with you, Thanassis? It's 9 pm already. Go on, start the rally, so that we can attack you and leave the damn place because the wife is waiting' (Interview with D. Livieratos, 21 May 1993).</page><page sequence="23">Sefenades: Policing Labour in Interwar Greece 77 they occurred, but rather on grounds of what they entailed to the detainee. Especially after 1929 (when the Idionymon law came into effect) an arrest definitely involved a beating, relatively long periods of imprisonment without trial, and an intense psychological shock purposely delivered to discourage individuals from continuing movement-related activity.47 A value of [4] is assigned to all injuries. Skipping over value [3] is intended to signify entry into a qualitatively different coercive sphere, the 'blood zone'. The scaling makes provisions for two more unit leaps, the first to signify entry into the zone of loss of life - 'killings', with a value of [6], and the second into that of mass and indiscriminate loss of life - 'mass killings' with a grade of [8], the highest. A practical, though evidently imperfect, cut-off point for the incidence of the latter is the death of more than four individuals in one assault.48 Coercion Indices This project 'sees' coercion only as physical violence directed against move- ment mobilizations.49 An implication which requires stressing is that most of the indices compiled are underestimations of the total coercion exercised by the police and military against the labour movement in interwar Greece. Index of Coercion (IC) and Cumulative Index of Coercion The Index of Coercion (IC) of any given mobilization is the sum total of the scores of the coercive practices directed against it. For example, when a mobi- lization is met solely with the arrest of one or more of its participants, the index is [2]. If, on top of that, injuries also occur, the index jumps to [6] ([2] + [4]); in case of 1-4 deaths occurring, the index becomes [12] ([2] + [4] + [6]), and so on and so forth. In case mass killings occur, however, no grade is assigned (and added) for deaths. This is the only combination of coercive occurrences where no addition is performed. 47 An additional reason for wishing to include the category is that it is a meaningful interval between dispersals and injuries, formally in place of the more obviously violent 'beatings', the occurrence of which cannot be safely inferred from the raw data available. Moreover, no arrests are counted which took place outside the context of movement-mobilizations. Therefore, even if coercion value [2] is slightly high, this is also to serve as a corrective to the scale's insensitivity to arrests not made during mobilizations. 48 Ideally, we should have been able to differentiate further between 'more killings' and 'mass killings', and assign a higher value to the latter. Unfortunately, the gaps existing in the raw data do not seem to make the expected benefit worth the additional complexity. For those who might object that a value of [8] is too small adequately to represent the exceptional violence involved in mass killings, it should be borne in mind that in most cases mass killings occurred on top of other forms of coercion. When compiling the Index of Coercion of those mobilizations (see below) the score thus jumps way above mere [8]. Moreover, assigning too high a value to mass killings (i.e. above [8]) would unduly undervalue the gravity involved in the other coercive forms. 49 The reason is unimaginatively prosaic: excessive gaps in the data. Unfortunately, portions are irretrievable. Some can still be salvaged (principally through oral history, but also systematic indexing of the labour press wherever available), but historians had better hurry.</page><page sequence="24">78 Journal of Contemporary History Vol 40 No I A year's Cumulative Index of Coercion (CIC) is the sum total of the IC scores of all the mobilizations taking place in its course. Frequency of Coercive Occurrence and Coerciveness The principal purpose of the CIC is to detect the evolution of state coercion across time. By itself, however, the CIC does not have any qualitative conno- tation (how high is 'high'?). To deal with this problem, two additional indices are used, the Index of Coercive Incidence, measuring the frequency of coercive assaults during every year, and the Index of Average Coerciveness, assessing their intensity in terms of violence involved. Index of Coercive Incidence (ICI) The operative question explored by the Index of Coercive Incidence (ICI) is: what percentage of labour mobilizations suffered a coercive assault? Accord- ingly, the ICI is obtained by dividing the total number of coercive incidents by the total number of movement mobilizations occurring during a year. The more the ratio approximates unity, the higher the coercive incidence, e.g. an ICI of [0.5] indicates that of every two mobilizations occurring, the police attack one. Index of Average Coerciveness (IAC) The ICI, however, is not by itself telling of the particular character of the coer- cion exercised. This problem is tackled by the Index of Average Coerciveness (IAC) which seeks to answer the following operative question: how violent was the average coercive assault? The ICI is obtained by dividing the yearly CIC by the number of coercive incidents occurring during that year. The number indicates a year's 'typical' form of coercive practice, and acquires its significance against the coercion measurement scale, e.g. an ICI of [3.8] means that in the year under consideration the average intensity of coercion was as severe to the collective movement activist as a hypothetical state of suffering something between injury and death.
