<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMISM AND THE ORIGINS OF ALIENATION: THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN JOHN P. DIGGINS To Marxists familiar with his work Thorstein Veblen poses a great ques- tion mark. His trenchant analysis of economic orthodoxy is matched by his equally trenchant analysis of dialectical materialism; and if he is sardoni- cally critical of the capitalist ethic of individualism, he is no less skeptical of the Marxist doctrine of class struggle.' Veblen remains an ideological enigma, a man of the Left who is easier to celebrate than to classify. Ever since he made his appearance as a social theorist at the turn of the century, radical scholars have claimed him as a valuable intellectual resource and potential ally in the struggle against bourgeois society and classical market theory - "a grand man!" exclaims the economist Joan Robinson.2 In 19059 during the midst of the "golden era" of American socialism, William English Walling informed readers of The International Socialist Review that Veblen's analysis of business enterprise "is not only more evolutionary, but also more revolutionary than that of Marx's" [sic].3 Three decades later another generation of radicals could read the sophisti- cated Marxist Quarterly and find reassurance in Lewis Corey's exhorta- tion: "All that is vital in Thorstein Veblen may fulfill itself in Marxism and socialism."4 During this Old Left era only the German emigres in Amer- ica, philosophers and sociologists like Herbert Marcuse, Theodor Adorno, and Max Horkheimer, seemed to be aware of the difficulties of assimilating Veblen into the Hegelian tradition of thought which had shaped Marx's outlook.'

DIGGINS len, while in Europe radical scholars like Georges Friedmann and Louis Rigal still appear to be seeking ways to reconcile Veblen's ideas with the Left and to regard him as a socialist malgre~ lui.6 It may be politically useful to compare Marx and Veblen. But a study of their different perspectives may serve the larger purpose of deepening our understanding of the problem of alienation as an historical phenomenon. This paper attempts such a study by contrasting Marx's and Veblen's analyses of the origins of property and by examining the far-reaching socio- logical ramifications of that phenomenon. By no means do I mean to imply that Veblen had an answer to the very problems he had uncovered. My aim is more modest: to suggest that Veblen had a different, and perhaps keener, grasp of these problems because, among other things, he had ac- cess to anthropological data of the late nineteenth century that was un- available to Marx.7 Both Marx and Veblen came to the study of economics by way of early training in philosophy, but Veblen extended his analysis of economic behavior into the relatively new disciplines of anthropology, ethnology, and sociology. In exploring these new fields, Veblen discovered new ways of looking at contemporary social relations by rediscovering the old ways in which people related to each other in early primitive com- munities. In this respect Veblen was far more than an institutionalist econ- omist or a technocratic reformer, the roles often attributed to him by American historians of the Progressive era. Above all else he was, as Perry Miller so uniquely discerned, "the bard of savagery."8 ALIENATION AND THE ORIGINS OF PROPERTY Marx's description of the process by which man becomes alienated is too familiar to discuss in detail here. His explanation of that process, however, may appear questionable when juxtaposed to a Veblenian (i.e., non- Hegelian) approach to the causal sequence of historical phenomena. To Marx, alienation originates in the emergence of private property and the division of labor. Denied the fruits of his labor and the right to determine the mode of work, man becomes estranged from himself and from others.

But why does alienation occur at all? "What a contradiction it would be," confessed Marx in his 1844 notebooks, "if the more man subjugates nature through work . . . man should renounce his joy in the producing and the enjoyment of his product for love of these powers." In acquiring the power to conquer nature, how did man lose the power to master himself? "How, we ask now, does it happen that man externalizes his labor, alienates it? How is this alienation rooted in the nature of human development?" With the question dramati- cally posed, Marx continues, "Let us consider more clearly these relation- ships." At this point the manuscript breaks off - unfinished.9 The same difficulties remain when Marx turns from questions about human behavior to the behavior of history itself. Marx begins his explora- tion into the processes of history by focusing on that which supposedly governs all human relations, productivity. Both the production of the means to support life and the exchange of the things produced occupy Marx's attention as he studies what he regards as the four basic historical epochs: "the Asiatic, the ancient, the feudal, and the modern bourgeois modes of production."10 The scheme is ingenious, but one wonders whether it is merely a description masquerading as an explanation. Con- sider, for example, the communal society that Marx believed characterized ancient Slavic villages and certain Asiatic communities (to which Engels added the Iroquois of North America). In this historical stage, land is held and tilled in common and products are shared communally in a society in which hunting, fishing, and cattle raising are the chief occupations. Why does this system, which Engels would term "primitive communism," break down and give rise to new forms of production that are no longer collec- tively owned? Marx was "thin on pre-history," Eric Hobsbawm noted;-" he wisely avoided the question, perhaps realizing that any answer would be nothing more than guesswork. But Engels took the basic Marxist presup- position that private property emerges when production surpasses subsis- tence and tried to apply it to early primitive society. "The advent- of pri- vate property in herds of cattle and articles of luxury," he wrote in The Origins of the Family, "led to an exchange between individuals, to a trans- formation of products into commodities. Here is the root of the entire revolution that followed." We are indeed on the verge of discovering why a 9.

However, the more Engels searched for the origin of this phe- nomenon, the more it eluded him. "How and when the herds were trans- formed from the collective ownership of the tribe . . . to the proprietorship of the heads of the families is not known to us," concludes Engels, who rests his case with a remark which reveals the theoretical impasse in which he finds himself - "the herds drifted into the hands of private individuals. " 12 In many of his excursions into classical antiquity and pre-history, Marx focused on land as the crucial factor in the evolution of private property. It was on privately-owned plots that slaves produced the surplus above that required for their own subsistence. Land became identical with wealth, and society became differentiated on the basis of property. But in his Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts, in contrast to his historical studies, Marx saw alienation as logically prior to land ownership. Here he suggests that instead of asking "What is the origin of private property?" we should ask "How can we explain the alienation that broke out in the course of human development?""3 How, indeed? It is no surprise that this question should pose less difficulty for the philosopher than for the historian. The former may reason his way out of the dilemma; the latter cannot, or should not, permit logic to substitute for evidence. Small wonder that many contemporary scholars, especially stu- dents of classical antiquity, have shied away from the search for the origins of things that occupied the speculations of late nineteenth-century an- thropologists and historians. The contemporary philosopher, however, and especially the Marxist, rushes in where the historian fears to tread. Thus the relationship between man's alienation and the emergence of property and the division of labor is scarcely a problem, either theoretical or factual, to the Yugoslavian philosopher Istvain Meszaros. That the means of man's dehumanization - the productive forces of history - would also serve as the means of man's rehumanization is an aspect of the human struggle for freedom that must be grasped as a "dialectical reciprocity," Meszdros advises.14 Similarly, the American philosopher Bertell Ollman informs us that since Marx never offered any "details" on how the original transfer from common to private property occurred, we need not bother with the question, at least not in historical terms. Oilman's learned discussion of the issue, however, shows that he himself is aware of the awesome dilemma Marx has left to students of history: if private property and the division of labor are "identical expressions" (Marx's phrase), and if private property 12.

Marx addressed himself directly to this "riddle": Private property is thus the product, the result, the necessary consequence of alienated labor, of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself. Private property thus results by analysis from the concept of alienated labor - i.e., of alienated man, of estranged labor, of estranged life, of estranged man. True, it is as a result of the movement of private property that we have obtained the concept of alienated labor (of alienated life) from political economy. But on analysis of this concept it becomes clear that though private property appears to be the source, the cause of alienated labor, it is really its consequence, just as the gods in the begin- ning are not the cause but the effect of man's intellectual confusion. Later this relationship becomes reciprocal. Ollmann, after quoting the above passage from the 1844 Notebooks, argues persuasively that Marx was correct in asserting that alienation cannot be formulated in the familiar terms of causal understanding: This "reciprocal effect" between private property and alienated labor is given the distinction of being called the "secret" of private property, where Marx says, "on the one hand it is the product of alienated labor, and . . . secondly it is the means by which labor alienates itself, the realization of this alienation." The logical tie which Marx posits between the two makes it impossible for one to appear without the other, and makes any attempt to establish historical primacy a fruitless task.'5 From the Marxist perspective, then, alienation is a process in which its activity and its consequence are one and the same, in which the traditional notions of cause and effect must be seen dialectically as two forces which are at the same time themselves and each other. The phenomenon of pri- vate property can be grasped from the same perspective. As Marx ob- served, it is connected with the disintegration of primitive society; it evolved "side by side" with the "communal and state property of an- tiquity" that culminated in Roman society; and it developed along with the social division of labor between town and country, the separation of indus- trial and commercial activities from those of agriculture.16 Such events can be understood without determining the necessity of their origins; for the attempt to establish the "historical primacy" of these relationships is, the philosopher advises, "a fruitless task." Seen from this privileged epis- temological position, private property appears, emerges, unfolds, grows, and develops, relating to everything in general and originating in nothing in particular. The "secret" of private property is illuminated philosophically, if only by ignoring it historically. 15.

DIGGINS THE BEGINNINGS OF OWNERSHIP: THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL DIMENSION Such a resolution of the "secret" of property and the "riddle" of aliena- tion could hardly be entertained by Thorstein Veblen. A Darwinist rather than a dialectician, Veblen remained convinced that the scientific revolu- tion ushered in by the theory of biological evolution had completely naturalized modern thought and all but rendered obsolete the Hegelian- Marxist categories of understanding.17 Above all, it was Marx's attempt to salvage a value theory from orthodox economics that Veblen found most troublesome. In attempting to transcend the ethic of capitalism, Marx may have only absorbed its ethos; for he extended the Ricardian analysis of the factors of production by formulating a theory of value in which labor, whether free or coerced, possesses the unique property of being able to produce more than is required for subsistence. In the Grundrisse as well as in Capital Marx insists that exploitation and alienation derive from prop- erty, which itself must be seen as an outcome of human effort, and he explains why all other factors which may contribute to the "human condi- tion" must be excluded, even the factor of consumption: We reduce this property to the relation to the conditions of production. Why- not to consumption, since the production of the individual is originally restricted to the reproduction of his own body through the appropriation of ready objects prepared by nature itself for consumption? Even where the only task is to find and to dis- cover, this soon requires exertion, labour - as in hunting, fishing, herding - and production (i.e., development) of certain capacities on the part of the subject.18 Veblen rarely used the word "alienation," and when he did so it usually meant to him, as it did to other social philosophers of his era, a political disinheritance involving natural rights. But there can be no doubt that Veblen was deeply occupied with the same phenomenon that had obsessed the early Marx. In his lesser-known but perhaps greatest book, The- In- stinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1914), Veblen observes that the suppression of this instinct, even though it may have been a necessary outcome of cultural and technological growth as man left the stage of primitive communal life, represents man's loss of freedom over his means of freedom, and this "supersession" is "the most universal and most radical mutation which human culture had undergone in its advance from savagery to civilization."19 In Veblen's analysis of the source of alienation, the loss of "free workmanship" lies not so much in production as in consumption, in the possession of wealth rather than in its creation, in the way in which goods come to be, not made, but owned. 17.

It is significant that when he addressed himself to this problem he refrained from using the term "'property" and titled his article "The Beginnings of Ownership," thereby taking the issue out of the Marxist and liberal perspectives and grounding it in new anthropological concepts. Veblen wanted to demonstrate, first of all, that in many archaic cultures the subjective apprehension of external objects was so strong that "the relation of any individual to his personal effects is conceived to be of a more intimate kind than that of ownership simply." The items that we see as lying objectively apart from man are seen in primitive society as extensions of human personality. In ancient tribal villages the "congeries of things," such as clothes, ornaments, and weapons, are not what modern economists would call commodities. To primitive man these articles "are conceived to be his in much the same sense as his hands and feet are his, or his pulse-beat, or his digestion, or the heat of his body, or the motions of his limbs or brain." So closely linked is the psychological relationship of person to thing that the-idea of ownership can scarcely be said to exist. "Such meagre belongings of the primitive savage as would under the nomenclature of a later day be classed as personal property are not thought of by him as his property at all; they pertain organically to his person. "21 How then did the idea of property arise? It could not have had its roots in the breakup of primitive communism. Seen from the eyes of primitive man, communal ownership is a contradiction in terms: the very idea of ownership implies an individual possessor. The sequence must be re- versed; communalism is of "relative late growth," perhaps a conscious response to an earlier non-communal stage. Nor is ownership an "instinc- tive notion," an innate idea deeply implanted in man's nature. On the contrary, it is an acquired cultural trait that must be learned. Neither could the concept of property have resulted from the increasingly uncertain 20. Marx also considered this possibility but then tried to explain away war by tracing it to the mode of production. He noted as an objection to his theory of property and the division of labor that "the fact of conquest appears to contradict this whole conception of history," and then proceeded to demonstrate that "for the conquering barbarian people, war itself is a regular form of intercourse, which is exploited all the more energetically the more the growth of population together with the traditional primitive mode of production arouses the demand for new means of production.'

DIGGINS status of articles and things, for a given object might even change hands "without passing out of the quasi-personal fringe" of the original owner. Possession is not necessarily synonymous with property. Slaves, for example, have use of their master's tools and thus possess the means of production, but in no way do they own or control them. Yet it is in the institution of slavery, and later of serfdom, that one sees a key connection: ownership begins where workmanship ends. But the connection is com- plex. "It will hold as a rough generalization," Veblen notes cautiously, "that ownership does not begin before the rise of a canon of exploit; but it is to be added that it also does not seem to begin with the first beginning of exploit as a manly occupation." The first ventures of exploit relate to hunting and growing, self-sustaining occupations the products of which are consumed collectively. Veblen cites two reasons why the practice of seiz- ing, accumulating, and privately claiming such products could not have begun under the "peaceable communistic regime of primitive savagery." First, the dissension resulting from such acts would have been fatal to the tribe. Second, the "primitive fighting horde still needs to consume its scanty means of subsistence in common, in order to give the collective horde its full fighting efficiency. Otherwise it would succumb before any rival horde that had not yet given up collective consumption."22 Even though predatory activity increases as life passes from peaceful savagery to barbarian exploitation, individual possession does not result from plunder alone; for the goods that are seized, weapons and food, continue to be essential to the survival of the conquering group. Thus in order for the idea of ownership to have arisen, the development of economic life must have reached a level where goods are durable rather than perishable. Yet economic growth is only a necessary and not a sufficient cause; even with abundance the idea of property may remain stillborn. We must understand property, Veblen seems to say, not in the way it is presented to experience, particularly the experience of nineteenth-century economic theorists. Rather, we must grasp the way it was apprehended at its very inception. In Veblen's analysis the birth of private property must await a change of consciousness, and the reorientation of human apprehen- sion occurs when the primitive horde seizes not goods but people, not the products of man but man himself. "Captives are items that do not fit into the communal scheme of consumption, and their appropriation by their indi- vidual captor works no manifest detriment to the group. At the same time these captives continue to be obviously distinct from their captor in point of individuality, and so are not readily brought in under the quasi-personal fringe. The captives taken under rude conditions are chiefly women.23 22. Ibid., 361-362. 23. Ibid., 363-364.</page><page sequence="9">THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN 121 Why women? Curiously, Veblen attributes no sexual motive to the cap- ture of women. Instead he suggested that except where there is a slave class of men, women are more useful since their labor is worth more than their maintenance and less "formidable" since they bear no weapons. But the sociological import of the capture of females is more significant than the economical or sexual. Women serve the 'symbolic function of "trophies" that attest to the prowess of their captor. "They are fit subjects for com- mand and constraint; it ministers to both his honor and his vanity to domineer over them, and their utility in this respect is very great. But his domineering over them is evidence of his prowess, and it is incompatible with their utility as trophies that other men should take the liberties with his women which serve as evidence of the coercive relation of the captor." A captured woman is not to be shared as a captured good is consumed collectively in primitive society. She is the one object which predatory man can claim by virtue of his demonstrated strength; and as this practice hardens into a custom, the "customary right of use and abuse over an object which is obviously not an organic part of his person constitutes the relation of ownership as," Veblen ironically adds, "naively apprehended." Ownership soon extends to claims upon the products of labor performed by the person owned, hence the birth of exploitation. At the root of such predatory behavior is not merely the pure impulse of economic profit but the deeper emotions of pride and "emulation." Women are first seized as prizes, human badges signifying that the owner, unlike "all the non- combatant or ignoble" members of the community, is too eminent and powerful to engage in productive labor. Whatever the relationship of slav- ery to property or capitalism, human captivity could scarcely have been possible without the contempt for manual labor, a contempt rooted, as we shall see, in the contamination of man's instincts for workmanship and parental benevolence. And the first sign of wealth was subjugated women, the only real "goods" which primitive man could possess. In this formula- tion of the problem of alienation Marx's sequence of historical phenomena is reversed: the lust for things, the "furies of interests," is the result of the seizure of persons, not the cause of it. And marriage by capture, Veblen seems certain, derives not so much from the scarcity of women as from the vanity of men. Veblen's interpretation of the origins of property and slavery, though possibly original in nineteenth-century economic and social theory, was not without antecedents. Plato's theory that the state originates through the subjugation of sedentary populations by nomads and hunters was later discovered by Hume, who criticized the classical, liberal version of the social contract on these grounds. Veblen had been influenced by Hume, and it is quite likely that the same skepticism shaped his attitudes toward liberal theories of property, attitudes readily reinforced by his Darwinian</page><page sequence="10">122 JOHN P. DIGGINS sense of struggle. Today, contemporary scholars of ancient history have noted the relationship between slavery and the demand of the ruling classes for servants, who are desired less for economic than for social reasons. Enslavement of persons and their conversion to property was a frequent occurrence in classical Greece; and in Rome, where the material level of life was better, and the lavish expenditures and military conquests brighter, the proportion of slaves to free populations was also greater. "Casual enslavement of individual outsiders, especially of captive women, went as far back as our evidence goes," writes M. I. Finley, a leading authority on slavery in classical antiquity. Finley is understandably intrigued by the motives for enslavement, and, after cautioning that the Greeks themselves engaged in no systematic discussion of the institution, he observes: "Yet somehow one must grasp the psychology of Xenophon when he made the proposal in all seriousness that the Athenian State acquire enough publicly owned slaves to work in the mines so that 'every Athenian be maintained at public expense'."24 No doubt Veblen would grasp that "psychology" of conspicuous disassociation from all manual labor, an attitude that some- how, despite the high esteem in which work was held by the pre-Socratic and Hippocratic philosophers, gained social acceptance through the writ- ings of Plato and Aristotle.25 Veblen's explanation of the beginnings of ownership, which locates the source of private property not in alienated labor but in the activities of nomads, hunters, and warriors, thus bears some resemblance to the subju- gation theory of the state, a school of thought which spans the whole course of Western intellectual history, from Plato and Aristotle to Nietzsche and Toynbee - a theory, one should add, that is unacceptable to Marxists.26 Veblen's observations may have also been familiar to some nineteenth-century anthropologists, but the uniquely prescient quality in Veblen's thought may be appreciated by comparing his speculations to those of the contemporary anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, who likewise sees women as the first form of "currency." Both Veblen and Levi-Strauss believe that many aspects of primitive mental structures exist in modern life; both concentrate on status distinctions, and not necessarily the mode of production, as the means by which men have come to domi- nate women; and both assume that the capture and exchange of women 24.

"In human society," writes Levi-Strauss, "it is the men who exchange the women, and not vice versa."27 Aside from the difficulties of verifying such speculations historically, Veblen's thesis must be judged in light of its internal coherence. Veblen may have revised Marx by showing that the capture of men and women precedes the passion for the objects produced by the captured person, that domination and exploitation have little to do with the labor theory of value, that, in short, oppression antedates alienation. Yet Veblen himself faced the same predicament as Marx. Veblen too believed that primitive society was peaceful, communal, and productive. Hence the paradox. If "natural" man enjoys workmanship, why does he feel compelled to capture women as trophies and servants to demonstrate that he no longer stoops to pro- ductive labor? If property is founded upon conquest and seizure, must we conclude that man is aggressive and acquisitive? HUMAN NATURE AND THE STATE OF NATURE: VEBLEN VERSUS HOBBES Veblen tried to answer such questions in The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts. The book opens with a description of man as "conditioned by the complement of instinctual proclivities and tropis- matic attitudes." The human animal is at the mercy of his instincts, but fortunately those instincts are impersonal, benevolent, and teleological, "conscious" tendencies that contain the potential for contributing to the material welfare of the community. Earlier, in his essay on "Why Is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science?" Veblen had described man as "not simply a bundle of desires that are to be saturated . . . but rather a coherent structure of propensities and habits which seek realization and expression in an unfolding activity."28 He was now obliged to explain how these propensities, bents, and instincts will aim man toward altruistic ends. The two major dispositions conducive to the common good are workman- ship and the parental bent. The former instinct, like the latter, is part of man's native endowment, and it functions so that man sees himself as "a center of unfolding impulsive activity - 'teleological' activity. He is an agent seeking in every act the accomplishment of some concrete, objective, impersonal end. By force of his being such an agent he is possessed of a taste for effective work, and a distaste for futile effort. He has a sense of the merit of serviceability or efficiency and of the demerit of futility, waste, or incapacity." The parental bent as an "instinctive disposition" implies 27.

DIGGINS more than a solicitude for the welfare of children, and it is not to be confused with "the quasi-tropismatic impulses to the procreation of off- spring." Rather the parental bent, especially as it flowered in archaic cul- tures, reaches out not only to the community but to future generations. It represents a "solicitude for the welfare of the race at large," and insofar as it guides man toward more efficient and productive activities in the interest of posterity, it reinforces the sense of workmanship. So closely connected are the two instincts that Veblen suggests that workmanship can be re- garded as the means by which the ends of the parental bent are realized.29 Veblen's theory of instincts brings a wince to the face of many modern scholars. The terminological confusions of his hopelessly interchangeable terms - 'propensity,'" "'bent,'" "'drive,'" "'habits,'" "'proclivity,'" "'sense, " "tropismatic attitude" - have led some sociologists to dismiss his work as unsophisticated.30 But Veblen well knew that instinct theory was "a con- cept of too lax and shifty a definition to meet the demands of exact biologi- cal science,"3" and he used the term with great caution and qualification in the book (later he told a friend that he meant by instinct "a direction anlage."9)32 There are confusions about the purpose as well as the precision of Veblen's concepts. Talcott Parsons, for example, likens Veblen's in- stinct of workmanship to Max Weber's idea of "the calling."33 The parallel is dubious. In Weber, work is an exercise in repressive moral duty; in Veblen, it is an expressive "unfolding activity," a totally secularized con- cept innocent of the psychological and spiritual anguish supposedly as- sociated with the "Protestant ethic." We should also be wary of equating Veblen's idea of workmanship with Marx's idea of man's basic nature as that of a homo faber. Veblen compared the workmanship instinct to the capacity for "play" and "idle curiosity," which suggests that the formative element in culture lay not in the biological necessity of production, as Marx would have it, but in various activities of symbolic expression as a means of human development - a point made by Veblen's greatest scholarly disciple, Lewis Mumford.34 Veblen was neither clear nor consistent in his descriptions of the nature of man. One hesitates to interpret so elusive and seemingly obscurantist a social scientist. What, for example, are we to make of Veblen's claim that man's instincts are counterpoised and not totally autonomous? The "in- 29. Veblen, Instinct of Workmanship, 1-37. 30.

Because they cannot be conceived as acting each and several in isolation and independent of one another, "they must there- fore incontinently touch, blend, overlap, and interfere." Even the instinct of workmanship, supposedly one of man's deepest drives, is not so "pas- sionate" that it can resist deflection. "It does not, under pressure, tena- ciously hold its place as a main interest in competition with the other, more elemental instinctive proclivities; but . . . it rather yields ground somewhat readily, suffers repression and falls into abeyance, only to reassert itself when the pressure of other, urgent interests is relieved."35 If an instinct can be perverted in such a manner one can only wonder if it can be called an instinct; and if man's "instinctual proclivities" can neutralize as well as reinforce one another, we are left in doubt as to which instincts are more generic and which are primary and fundamental.36 However imprecise his terminology, Veblen was convinced that the basic instincts of peaceful, savage man lose their primal force through the processes of change and growth. Instincts, for example, are teleological, impulses toward immediate ends. However, the ways and means to ac- complish those ends that the instincts seek are the concern of intelligence, a faculty which is more "extensive" and "elaborate" and can, con- sequently, lose sight of the end it is intended to serve. "All instinctive action is teleological, it involves holding to a purpose." Intelligence, on the other hand, can be distracted as change and development drive man farther from the instinctual prompting that gave rise to intelligence. Unlike Kant's "reason," intelligence is only a tool without normative imperatives; it does not impose duty on inclination. Thus the instinct of workmanship can combine with a concern for beauty to produce goods which are both useful and aesthetic; but in a community of pecuniary status it can develop a devotion to technique alone, and the worker's skill and intelligence is frit- tered away in useless, decorative detail. The parental bent is no less cor- ruptible. It may have its origins in altruistic impulses, but it gives way to the "self-regarding sentiments" of a "gerontocracy" as subservience to able-bodied elders gains the upper hand in the increasingly predatory and warlike culture that characterizes the late stages of savagery and the early stage of barbarism. Instincts are deflected or distorted as institutions de- velop, and by "institutions" Veblen does not mean physical structures -corporations, governments, universities -but "prevalent habits of thought," the ideas, beliefs, and principles by which men order their lives .37 35.

DIGGINS Except for Veblen's suggestion that instincts lose their primal quality (or innocence) due to the processes of historical development and the conflict- ing applications of intelligence resulting from "institutional complications," it is not exactly clear how perverse institutions evolve out of productive instincts. If man is born an amiable savage, why does he become an ag- gressive barbarian? What indeed is Veblen's image of man? In the Leisure Class Veblen referred occasionally to the "predatory instinct." Although he presupposed an initial state of peaceful savagery, he nevertheless conceded that there is no point in cultural evolution "prior to which fighting does not occur," a behavior he attributed to the pervasive "sexual competition," evidence for which could be seen in the "known habits" of primitive groups and anthropoid apes and in our own "well- known promptings of human nature." Yet the point in question is not the possible occasion of combat but the frequent occurrence of "an habitual bellicose frame of mind," the elevation of the fight to a normative institu- tion. This martial state is attained "only when the predatory attitude has become the habitual and accredited spiritual attitude for the members of the group." Thus the predatory instinct is merely potential and only be- comes "deeply ingrained in the habits of thought of those peoples who have passed under the discipline of a protracted predatory culture."38 When Veblen touched upon the question of human nature in The Instinct of Workmanship, he did not presuppose the "natural" goodness of man, thereby assuming what needs to be explained. Nor did his thoroughgoing Darwinism allow him to conceive -man as a tragic figure burdened by psychic guilt or original sin. He admitted that in the controversy over man's nature that divided the idealists from the realists the evidence on either side, drawn from anthropology and social theory, "is by no means unequivocal."39 But he could not accept the position of the nineteenth- century Social Darwinists, who looked to the principle of natural selection as evidence that man is naturally combative and socially competitive. Darwinism showed only that the stronger members of the species have eliminated the weaker. Not only does such a theory suggest that the pres- ently stronger may be deemed unfit and their "instinctual proclivities" useless as evolutionary change continues to take place, but it also suggests that at each previous stage in the evolutionary scheme the extinct species must have been weaker by virtue of being less aggressive, so that at the dawn of history it may well be that man was indeed peaceful. Veblen knew well that many of the assumptions about man in liberal and conservative social theory were rooted less in Darwinism than in the politi- cal philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. In The Instinct of Workmanship he 38. Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (New York, 1953), 31-32, 38. 39.

Hobbes's account may explain the origins of the Leviathan, but it could hardly ex- plain the biological requirements of survival. How could men exist for a day in a society of acquisitive creatures where everyone's right to every- thing threatens anyone's right to anything? "It seems antecedently improb- able that the domestication of the crop plants and animals could have been effected at all except among people leading a passably peaceable, and presently sedentary life." Not only did the extraordinary length of time for what was achieved in "remote antiquity" speak against Hobbes's view of man as a born predator, but the prevalence of maternal deities among prehistoric communities suggested a culture of fecundity rather than feroc- ity. As to Hobbes's claim that "fear" haunted the state of nature and hence led to the desire for order, Veblen looked to extant tribal societies and found this to be true among some "warlike" natives in Australia and lower Malaya, but not the case among the more peaceable Eskimos and Pueblo Indians. Hobbes had seen sixteenth-century England suddenly plunged into war and revolution, and he and other English political theorists would forever dread a reversion to the state of nature. Veblen's world would also be plunged into chaos and turmoil in the years of World War I, but for him the state of nature would remain not a source of anxiety but of redemption: The savage mode of life, which was, and is, in a sense, native to man, would be characterized by a considerable group solidarity within a relatively small group, living very near the soil, and unremittingly dependent for their daily life on the workmanlike efficiency of all the members of the group. The prime requisite for survival under these conditions would be a propensity unselfishly and impersonally to make the most of the material means at hand and a penchant for turning all resources of knowledge and material to account to sustain the life of the groUp.40 THE CONTAMINATION OF THE INSTINCTS Veblen could not avoid the question of humankind's primal alienation if he were to presume an innocent stage of peaceful savagery. In his analysis the condition of alienation does not spring from private property, the historical origins of which he regarded as "a hazardous topic of speculation."41 40. Ibid., 36-37, 101. 41. Ibid., 149. In his essay on "The Beginnings of Ownership" (1898), Veblen offered one possible interpretation of the emergence of the psychology of human possession. In The In- stinct of Workmanship (1914), however, he discusses several other explanations that could account for the transition from the savage stage of "free workmanship" to the barbarian stage of pecuniary control of property. In exploring the origins of property, Veblen examines the relationship between technological development and control of the materials and means of production ("crops, fruit trees, live stock, mechanical contrivances"), conjectures whether "property provokes predation or predation initiates ownership," and speculates on the con-</page><page sequence="16">128 JOHN P. DIGGINS Much less does it arise with the development of industrial capitalism, which he regarded as merely a continuation of the "barbaric" past, with the modern captain of industry carrying out the role of the archaic chieftain of combat. Nor does it first manifest itself, as it does with Marx, with the appearance of the "alien medium" of money,42 which Veblen, sensing it to be the symbol rather than the substance of the problem, whimsically de- scribed as "the exact science of making change."43 On the contrary, in human productivity itself may lie the seed of alienation. Aside from the complication and deflection of instincts due to cumulative habit, Veblen observed that "the most obstructive derangement that besets workmanship is what may be called the self-contamination of workmanship itself." This infection arises when primitive man, in order to comprehend the natural world so as to labor upon it and control it, imputes to external objects familiar personal qualities. This tendency toward anthropomorphism or animism leads man to project onto external things his own workmanlike bent. As a result the inert, impersonal phenomena of nature take on per- sonal meaning, and human knowledge itself undergoes a basic transforma- tion: As all men habitually act under the guidance of instincts, and therefore by force of sentiment instinctively look to some end in all activity, so objects with which the primitive workman has to do are also conceived as acting under impulse of an instinctive kind; and a bent, a teleological or pragmatic nature, is in some degree imputed to them and comes as a matter of course to be accepted as a constituent element in their apprehended make-up. A putative pragmatic bent innate in external things comes in this way to pass curren as observed matter of fact. By force of the sense of workmanship external objects .;*.re in great part apperceived in respect of what they will do; and their most substantial characteristic, therefore, their intimate individual nature, in so far as they are conceived as individual entities, is that they will do things.44 According to Veblen, in the early savage stage of history the mentalities of "matter of fact and matter of imputation run along side by side" without serious adverse effect on the development of primitive technology. The imputation of anthropomorphic traits to plants and animals, for example, had not hindered tillage, cattle-breeding, or domestication, although primi- tive man's projection of such traits to fire and certain types of rock re- nection between religion and the habits of enterprise. But Veblen, who knew as much about the Puebloes as Max Weber knew about the Puritans, was reluctant to commit himself to any unilateral interpretation, though he leaned toward the technological. "The forces which may bring about such a transition are often complex and recondite, and they are seldom just the same in any given two instances. Neither the material situation nor the human raw material involved are precisely the same in all or several instances, and there is no coercively normal course of things that will constrain the growth of institutions to take a particular form or to follow a particular sequence in all cases" (ibid., 147). 42.

But as the industrial arts grow, they come more and more to rest on objective knowledge, and this leads to the expansion of a scientific milieu which requires impersonal adaptation for its control. Thus, although anthropomorphic instincts re- main, animism is limited by the demands of practicality. Yet animism is not so much eliminated as sublimated. Knowledge has evolved in a dualistic manner, as a growth in two ranges of apprehension, with animism pitted against facticity. Hence the world is divided into two categories of percep- tion: anthropomorphic and inert. Scientific progress occurred when early man perceived a phenomenon as inert and asked, "What can I do with it?" Similarly, technological understanding is diverted and workmanship "con- taminated" when man perceives a phenomenon as animate and asks, "What can it do on its own?" Despite all the advances in industrial and scientific knowledge, modern man has yet to liberate himself from his primitive heritage enough to consider only the first question. The task may be psychologically impossible. Veblen suggests; for the more man works upon the materials of earth, the more the animistic qualities "take up a more circumspect, ingenious and idealized form." For so alien to mankind, with its instinctive sense of workmanship, is the mutilation of brute creation into mere opaque matter-of-fact, and so indefeasibly does the "consciousness of kind" assert itself, that each successive renunciation of such an imputed bias of workmanship in concrete objects is sought to be redeemed by pushing the imputation farther into the background of observed phenomena and running their putative workmanship bias in more consummately anthropomorphic terms. So an animistic conception of things comes presently to supplement, and in part supplant, the more naive and immediate imputation of workmanship, leading up to farther and more elaborate myth-making; until in the course of elaboration and refinement there may emerge a monotheistic and providential Creator seated in the infinitely remote but ubiquitous space of four dimensions.45 Herein lies the dilemma. Marx assumed that through work man would be able to overcome the dualism that separates man from nature because subjective human activity is itself the process of objective activity through which man "humanizes nature."46 Veblen doubted that this chasm could be bridged, that man could comprehend the world simply by changing it. Whereas Marx believed that man must act in order to know, Veblen be- lieved that man must apprehend before he acts, and what he apprehends may never be the real world as it really is. Man labors upon matter while at the same time never really grasping the natural world; for a disenchanted nature, so necessary to scientific progress, is so chilling to man that he is compelled to impute anthropomorphic interpretations to objects and in- stitutions of his own creation, thereby rendering what is natural and changeable sacred and immutable. Workmanship, then, carries within itself 45. Ibid., 58-59. 46. Marx, "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts," 304.</page><page sequence="18">130 JOHN P. DIGGINS the seeds of its own alienation ("self-contamination"). It often arises only through an animistic identification with the natural world, for primitive man needs first to empathize with that which he must understand. But this process can continue only up to a point, since reality has the capacity to resist false interpretations. Still, the mastery of nature cannot be com- pletely carried out without any illusion of ruling, inherent powers or hidden qualities;47 and this illusion, Veblen implied, shaped both the "invisible laws" of Adam Smith's world and the "teleology" of Marx's philosophy of history. Smith and Marx extolled the virtues of labor (albeit for different reasons), but Veblen was careful to point out that workmanship "is peculiarly subject to bias. It does not commonly, or normally, work to an indepen- dent, creative end of its own, but is rather concerned with the ways and means whereby instinctively given purposes are to be accomplished."48 Veblen did not specify what these "instinctively given purposes" are, but he did state that man's regard for his reputation is "a characteristic man always had and no doubt always will have."'49 This tendency is only latent in the sedentary peaceful culture of savagery where men are valued in terms of their industrial efficiency and serviceability. But the "incentive to emulation" is present in communal society even if not pronounced (as modern anthropologists have discovered among the prestige and shame cultures of the Andaman islanders, the Trobrianders, and the Maori fisher- men).50 Much as Rousseau had intuited that primitive man's development of "conveniences" had produced "the first emotion of pride in him," and that men began to "know what esteem was" when they lost their self- sufficiency with the emergence of group activity,51 so too did Veblen, drawing upon contemporary ethnological studies, conclude that man's labor activities were bound up with the nature of his social being. "Wherever the circumstances of traditional life lead to an habitual comparison of one person with another in point of efficiency, the instinct of workmanship works out in an emulative or invidious comparison of persons." The up- 47. Among the animistic phenomena that even a modern matter-of-fact attitude has been unable to extirpate, Veblen mentions the concept of causality, particularly the search for unseen causes in observed effects, natural law, and God. Even the skeptical modern scientist can only replace old deities by substituting himself as a new wonder-worker. "It is as the creative workman, the Great Artificer, that he has taken his last stand against the powers of spiritual twilight" (Veblen, Instinct of Workmanship, 59-60). 48. Ibid., 34-35. 49.

Thus workmanship, already infected by a "pragmatic bent" which causes the worker to see inert objects and natural phenomena as self-activating, suffers a further contamination by the "canons of invidious distinction" which come to rule a pecuniary culture. Yet the instinct of workmanship never completely atrophies, Veblen noted, and in the early stages of capitalism it may ex- press itself in a dedication to achievement and a repugnance toward waste and futility. Nevertheless, as society modernizes, the instinct becomes perverted and "tends -more and more to shape itself into a straining to excel others in pecuniary achievement,'"53 evidence for which is finally demon- strated in a life-style that contradicts the very essence and ethic of work- manship - the life of acquisition and leisure rather than production and labor. In a culture characterized by status emulation, meaning and value are sought not in the processes of production but in the objects of con- sumption, commodities which have inherited the animistic qualities of power and personal prestige - the sociological dimension of "reification" that is perhaps Veblen's greatest contribution to modern social theory. Man is flawed in two respects, and herein lies the source of his aliena- tion. The first flaw is the curse of animism, the mind's tendency to mediate matter so that man cannot accept facts simply as objects. There can be no knowledge that is not mediated by prior knowledge, by "prevalent habits of thought." The result of man's anthropomorphic predicament is the re- sistance of society to rational comprehension. The second flaw is the social snare in workmanship itself. Based on the canons of efficiency and social utility, only to be contaminated by the emulative instinct, workmanship by its very nature can only promote the performance principle at the cost of the pleasure principle (to use Freud's terms). Veblen was convinced that human productivity must be directed toward the interests of the community at large, but he was also convinced that the community's "pecuniary can- ons of taste" determine what shall be produced. When a product is made to satisfy others, it loses its own intrinsic value and the joy of workmanship cannot be an end in itself. And when a product is made solely for the purpose of exchanging it for goods made by others, the laborer now as- sumes he can realize himself not in production but in consumption, that he 52. Veblen, Leisure Class, 29. 53. Ibid., 40.</page><page sequence="20">132 JOHN P. DIGGINS can buy his way out of what he had worked himself into. Thus workman- ship, an ennobling, altruistic instinct, compels the worker to contribute to his own alienation. He is not so much exploited as socialized by the pres- sures of "indivious comparison." THE MACHINE PROCESS AND IDLE CURIOSITY Veblen tried to find a way out of both of these dilemmas, the anthropomor- phic predicament and the inversion of workmanship into servitude. In the place of man's inevitable animistic propensities Veblen called for the as- cendancy of "the machine process." The machine "throws out an- thropomorphic habits of thought. It compels the adaptation of the workman to his work, rather than the adaptation of the work to the workman."54 Men must work with the machine and abide by its processes, for the "discipline" of the machine purges all the anthropomorphic residue in man's nature. The "matter-of-fact" frame of mind is the "cultural inci- dence" of machine technology. Liberated by the machine, man will be able to see things in terms of cause and effect rather than of good and evil, of "weight, tale and measure" rather than of merit or demerit, of natural processes rather than of established rules of precedent, of impersonal ob- jects rather than of personal forces. Veblen welcomed what Henry Adams and Max Weber dreaded: the disenchantment of the world as a result of the extirpation of animism and supernaturalism. Only then will magic, religion, nationalism, the culture of consumption, the right of property, and the wastefulness and futility of war cease to make sense to a mind so mechan- ical it is no longer capable of alienating itself because it has been freed from the need to mediate experience in human terms. Surely this is a strange resolution of the human condition: man can recover his pre-alienated wholeness only by divesting himself of his emo- tional qualities as a man! The obvious ethical dilemmas of such a proposi- tion need hardly be mentioned. The real difficulty is that Veblen's resolu- tion only deepens the paradox of alienation itself. Veblen fails to explain fully why the machine came into existence in the first place, why man, unlike the rest of the animal kingdom, was not content to confine himself to what life objectively requires but instead needed to invent technology. That man did so indicates that he did not become alienated, did not fall from a state of "primitive communism" (Marx) or "peaceful savagery" (Veblen), but that he was already alienated at the center of his being, that the very "instinct of workmanship" that produced the machine estranged man from his essence. For if man's being coincides fully with that of nature, he would be without necessity; his aspirations and his satisfactions would be 54. Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of Business Enterprise (Clifton, N.J., 1973), 310.</page><page sequence="21">THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN 133 one and the same; and hence the world would not be alien to him. But the invention of the machine, whether primitive tools or modern technology, suggests "desire," the need for man to become that which originally he is not. Why does man work? It is curious that both Veblen and Marx, while criticizing the capitalist notion that labor reflects necessity, shy away from the deeper implications of man as animal laborans.55 Neither considers that work itself may be alienating insofar as man is driven to exert himself because he is part of nature yet aspires to be more than nature. (Weber attributed this condition to the Angst of Protestantism, especially Cal- vinism; but Ortega y Gasset, writing in a Catholic environment, sees Western man in general as "a kind of ontological centaur.")56 Both Veblen and Marx asked man not to question the meaning of existence but to expand his power over the materials of existence through industry and technology - "the open book of man's essential powers."57 Thus both inadvertently followed the Protestant tradition of urging man to seek in labor what had been lost in life. Moreover, Marx and Veblen were simi- larly preoccupied with the problem of ideology, with thinking that is un- conscious of its motives and with habits of thought that distort the mind's perception of reality. Both believed that genuine liberation begins only when all illusions end. Yet one can only wonder whether the "animism" and "false consciousness" which Veblen and Marx themselves tried to exorcise returned to plague their own thoughts. In the assumptions of both thinkers, work takes on magical qualities; it is the medium whereby Veblen and Marx impute to the processes of the natural world qualities that origi- nate in the human world. The machine is to Veblen what the proletariat is to Marx: the mythic agency through which ideals born of pure desire are realized as objective fact. Primitive man credits sticks and stones of proved efficacy with occult power; in the "modern" minds of Veblen and Marx inanimate processes (i.e., the "discipline of the machine") or metaphysical abstractions (i.e., the "negation of negation") appear to be unconsciously conceived in terms of human values in order to render the external world obedient to their moral wishes.58 55.

DIGGINS We have seen that Veblen had not only an answer to animism but also an answer to the second flaw that besets man, the inversion of workmanship into servitude. If the discipline of technology could help overcome the first defect, the remedy for the second lay in the "instinct of idle curiosity." Veblen described this "instinct" in "The Place of Science in Modern Civilization" (1906), where he set out to distinguish genuine empirical in- quiry from the pragmatic method of knowledge. "Pragmatism creates noth- ing but maxims of expedient conduct. Science creates nothing but theories." Scientific knowledge advances only when men think in defiance of immediate interests and exercise an "irrelevant attention" to practicali- ty, an indifference to the consequences of ideas in the interest of their total comprehension. The colorless, disembodied epistemology that science as- pires to is best approached and systematized under the "canons of curios- ity rather than expediency." Only a science that is purely speculative can liberate the imagination to question its own preconceptions and challenge the given norms of society. Veblen's essay thus attempts to illuminate the limitations of pragmatism as an epistemological theory. A product of American culture, pragmatism could hardly be a resource from which to question the foundations of that culture. Not only does pragmatism, an unreflective philosophy which had its origins in man's early consciousness of the biological struggle for survival, tend toward adjustment and adapta- tion, it tends toward teleological imputation as well. It is no coincidence, Veblen mused, that contemporary American pragmatic philosophers were reading into the nineteenth-century doctrine of evolution the eighteenth- century doctrine of progress.59 In The Instinct of Workmanship Veblen returns to the notion of idle curiosity. He now suggests that workmanship and curiosity may be incom- patible. The common man has little capacity for natural wonder, especially in a culture of activism and acquisition, and thus free-floating curiosity remains the peculiar genius of exceptional individuals who are regarded as "dreamers . . . of unsound mind." The quality of idleness, of involuntary reflection, implies a complete absence of utilitarian aim or sentiment, and this explains why it receives such scant attention in America, even though American society benefits from the knowledge and factual information de- rived from disinterested speculation. Workers labor under the habits and conventions of existing culture, while idle curiosity is "persistently disturb- ing the body of knowledge on which workmanship draws." But even when that body of knowledge incorporates the new information discovered by the curious dreamers, we are no closer to the truth since workmanship reshapes reality to its own purposes: it is communicable; and even if it is not, he is likely to reproduce the symptoms. So it has befallen Veblen." (Johnson, review of The Instinct of Workmanship in the Political Science Quarterly, 31 [1916], 631.) 59. Veblen, Place of Science, 1-31.</page><page sequence="23">THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN 135 Of the material so offered as knowledge, or fact, workmanship makes use of whatever is available. In ways already indicated this utilization of ascertained "facts" is both furthered and hindered by the fact that the information which comes to hand through the restless curiosity of man is reduced to systematic shape, for the most part or wholly, under canons of workmanship. For the large generality of human knowledge this will mean that the raw material of observed fact is selec- tively worked over, connected up and accumulated on lines of a putative teleologi- cal order of things, cast in something like a dramatic form. From which it follows that the knowledge so gained is held and carried over from generation to generation in a form which lends itself with facility to a workmanlike manipulation; it is already digested for assimilation in a scheme of teleology that instinctively commends itself to the workmanlike sense of fitness. But it also follows that in so far as the per- sonalized, teleological, or dramatic order so imputed to the facts does not, by chance, faithfully reflect the causal relations subsisting among these facts, the utili- zation of them as technological elements will amount to a borrowing of trouble. So that the concurrence of curiosity and workmanship in the assimilation of facts in this way may, and in early culture must, result in a retardation of technological advance, as contrasted with what might conceivably have been the outcome of this work of the idle curiosity if it had not been congenitally contaminated with the sense of workmanship and thereby lent itself to conceptions of magical efficacy rather than to mechanical efficiency.60 We rub our eyes! It is as though Veblen has presented-us with an epis- temological nightmare. Experience will always be conditioned by animistic traits and hence cannot provide truth; thought will always be distorted in action; and workmanship will never be able to rise above a manipulative concern for using knowledge rather than grasping reality. Only "idle curiosity" can free itself from immediate interests and anthropomorphic illusions and furnish us with knowledge of phenomena by virtue of its superior perception of the phenomenon of knowledge. But even this pre- cious intellectual resource is "contaminated" the moment it is applied, the moment it ceases being idle. If the problem of society is the problem of knowledge of society, as Karl Mannheim has made us aware, Veblen faced this epistemological issue squarely. He questioned an assumption basic to both the pragmatist and the Marxist, the assumption that through "praxis" the perception of reality can be identified with the nature of reality itself, that the social world can be "known" simply by acting upon it and transforming it. Thus Veblen could offer no solution to human alienation except to invoke the mystique of idle curiosity, a mode of cognition so bereft of functional content that it could not be corrupted by existing institutions, an epistemology so fired by the flame of pure intention that it had no obligation to any cause other than to the canon of curiosity itself. The idea is noble, but is it plausible? Pragmatists and Marxists alike would maintain that Veblen divorces theory from action, that he wants to meditate on the problems of existence rather than solve them. These criti- 60.

"Idle curiosity" is really a statement of a condition rather than a remedy for it. Curiosity presupposes a state of intellectual void, an attempt to discover in thought what cannot be found in action. It can hardly serve as the means by which one overcomes alienation, since it is actually a description of alienation. Veblen would have man know the world before he changed it, but knowing carries the same implication for Veblen as work does for Marx. Knowing begins in doubt just as labor begins in desire. Both ac- tivities indicate that man is driven by an impulse to know more than he can learn and to become more than he is. The need to know and the desire to do suggest an emptiness within the nature of man, a craving for self- realization. It is difficult to see how alienation can be overcome through the activities that manifest the very anxiety of alienation itself. Indeed, such an assumption may be the illusion of "animism." Whatever the validity of this judgment, it is too negative to serve as a conclusion. Veblen may be rejected for offering an empirical solution to what is perhaps basically a philosophical problem, just as he may be ridiculed - the favorite temptation of his critics - for looking to the "engineers" as the political redeemers of modern industrial society. One of Veblen's most important contributions, however, is the anthropological sensibility he brought to bear upon contemporary sociological theory. He seemed to have an intuitive understanding that the class division has throughout history coincided with the division of those who live in order to work and those who live without working. Whether or not he sufficiently documented his thesis, he perceived in the simultaneous emergence of property and a leisure class the first formation of social role systems that would serve to legitimate class society in general and modern capitalism in particular. It is to Veblen's credit that he was formally writing about economics, actually delving into anthropology, and ultimately contributing to the development of sociology.
