These are indicated by chapter titles: the Fall (1), Punishment (2), Rule of Satan (3), Salient Expressions of Original Sin (4), Sick and Wounded Humanity (5) and Original Sin in a Christological Perspec- tive. There are six useful appendices and one contains the Greek texts cited part- ly or summarized in English in the body of the book. Dr. Lukken's method is to outline the various interpretations of aspects of the doctrine, biblically and patristically, and then to examine his sacramentaries to see which of these interpretations are found or not found there. The work is done with great care, thoroughness and a mastery of the ancient sources and their mod- ern commentators. He does not fail to recognize that liturgical language is a dis- tinct hieratical tongue of a special group of communities and that it changes with the centuries; he is adept at tracing departures from the simple, sober, functional Latin of the Roman rite in borrowings of tender and sentimental Gallicanisms or more consciously rhetorical Orientalisms. He is equally aware of the determina- tive importance of symbols and gestures in the interpretation of liturgical texts. A few criticisms of this impressive work are in order. The translator served the author well, except on p. 149 line 2 where an indefinite article is missing, and in rendering the past tense of 'to spit' as 'spit' (p. 245 line 6). There are a few typographical terrors. More serious is the typical European habit of wishing to have a work translated to interest English-speaking readers, but to disregard any theological or liturgical scholarship written in English. I missed both N. P. Wil- liams' classical Bampton Lectures on The Doctrines of the Fall and Original Sin and Gregory Dix's The Shape of the Liturgy, to take two outstanding lacunae in the bibliography and the text. Occasionally also, as on p. 72, I found him adopting an either/or conclusion when a both/and would have been possible. Despite these warts-and they are only little ones-I found this a fine profile of its subject in a genre too infrequently attempted.

Introduction, Greek text, trans- lation and commentary by Jean Sirinelli and idouard des Places. Sources Chretiennes, no. 206. Paris: editions du Cerf, 1974. 338 pp. Eusebius' Praeparatio Ez,angelica has been consulted chiefly as an indispen- sable source of quotations from Greek philosophical works which are otherwise lost. It is the merit of this new edition to bring out with special clarity the stature of the work in its own right, as a contribution to apologetics. The Greek text was prepared by des Places, generally following the text of Karl Mras in the GCS; the extensive introduction and commentary were written by Sirinelli. In Sirinelli's view, Eusebius gave a new forcefulness and unity to apologetics in the process of answering the pagan indictment that the Christians had forsaken the ethnic tra- ditions of their own peoples and adopted the beliefs of the despised Jews-yet had not even followed the Jews' ancestral way of life but pursued a totally new way, something even more outrageous to the classical mind. Eusebius disarmed the opposition by openly acknowledging the accusation but setting the facts in a different light. Hence the tightly drawn structure of his apology (the Praeparatio and its sequel, the Demonstratio): (1) why the religious traditions of the nations deserve to be forsaken; (2) why the Christians preferred the beliefs of the He- brews; (3) why, in adopting the scriptures of the Jews, they did not follow their ritual law; and (4) what the doctrines of Christianity are in their fullness. In this first volume the most attention is given, quite naturally, to the first aspect. Sirinelli shows how Eusebius' extensive quotations from the Greek "his- torians of religion" are used, and sometimes misused, to back up a theory of his own about the history of religion: that the original religion was a worship of the heavenly bodies, without statues or temples, theogonies or myths (this was sup- BOOK REVIEWS 531</page><page sequence="2">CHURCH HISTORY ported by the text from Deut. 4.19 that God "gave the heavenly bodies to the na- tions"); that polytheism, with its anthropomorphic deities and mythic narratives, came later and thus was an innovation, indeed, was not even a native growth in Greece but was imported from the barbarians of Phoenicia and Egypt (quite naturally, then, the Hellenes ought to abandon it in favor of the more philosophical truths contained in the Hebrew Scriptures); and that the allegorizations of the Stoics are a hopeless muddle, because they interpret thle polytheistic myths, which came later, in terms of the earlier religion of nature. If subsequent volumes of this ledition have the same detailed commentary, the fifteen books of the Praeparatio will not be finished in less than half a dozen volumes. But the commentary justifies its length by offering helpful discussions of Eusebius' often slippery grammar and style, and above all an important interpreta- tion of Eusebius' achievement as an apologist. The Divinity School, Vanderbilt University EUGENE TESELLE The Byzantines and Their World. By PETER ARNOTT. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1973. xi + 286 pp. $8.95. Mr. Arnott, who is professor of Dramatic Arts at Tufts University and who has already produced books on the Greeks and the Romans, writes "to give a taste of things" (p. ix). The dust jacket makes a more ambitious claim for the book, calling it "a social history of the period from the foundation of the Eastern Empire in the 4th century A.D. to the fall of Constantinople." We had best judge the author's accomplishment against his own stated purpose, for the book lacks at least two elements of sound social history: a governing idea according to which the cha- otic information available for a particular society is sorted out and organized, and a theory of the relations between thought and action, religion and society. Arnott's ready eye and ear for the dramatic unquestionably lends a live- liness to the telling of familiar stories. Moreover, by frequent and illuminating typological sweeps from antiquity through Byzantium to the present he not only alerts us to familiar analogies with unfamiliar situations, but also reflects some- thing of the Byzantine's own characteristic sense of time-collapsing tradition. And he can transform the eccentricities of the voyager and yarn-spinner Cosmas Indicopleustes (pp. 145-152) into a cosmography of the Byzantine mind. Sketches of life in Constantinople, Rome, Ravenna and Thessaloniki are well-differentiated, illustrating the variety of urban life in the Empire. Still, one can suspect that the "taste of things" Arnott has served up is more spice than meat. Anecdotal history written by the non-specialist is certain- ly a respectable genrie of literature, and can occasionally be "truer" than the more myopic productions of the expert. But Byzantium jealously exacts from those who would understand and explain her a kind of patient commitment to intricate detail to which Arnott makes no pretensions. There is a rhetorical integrity to his presentation, but he is, necessarily, eclectically dependent on several mod- ern writers, none of whom is acknowledged. The absence of a bibliography, even for the sources cited very sketchily in the footnotes, is a serious flaw. There are some careless errors of fact and judgment; for example, Julian is put in the fifth century (p. 11); there was "no sense that the Bishop of Rome enjoyed superior status" even as late as the beginning of the fourth century (p. 37); the pagan his- torian Ammianus Marcellinus is called "a good Christian" (p. 63); a hundred of the 137 corpses in the Basilica of Sicininus (not Sicinius) following the Damasus- Ursinus riots disappear (p. 63); 1054 is trotted out yet again as the point in time at which the rift between East and West was at its widest (p. 184). Much more damaging for anyone who wants to comprehend Byzantine so- ciety, and especially for readers of this journal, is the author's Protestant (see p. xi) prejudice against theology. As Arnott insists at the beginning, there was more to Byzantium than religion, and there was more to religion than theology. But it is not true that "we think of the Byzantines as obsessed with religion be- 532</page></plain_text>
