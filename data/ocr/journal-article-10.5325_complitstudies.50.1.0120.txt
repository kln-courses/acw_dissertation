      <p>In this article, I employ “the Pacific” as a contact zone, method, and concept with which to examine the dynamic, shifting relationship between land and sea that allows indigenous literature in the transpacific context to engage all of its ecopoetic complexity. The Pacific is the largest oceanic divide on earth. In recent years, issues around global capitalism, national identity, community, and the ecology of the Pacific region have sparked intriguing and provocative discussions. Research along these lines celebrates the networking and coalition activities of various groups of people in the Pacific, and highlights the circulation of ideas and cultures that I believe to be crucial to contemporary ecological scholarship. It offers an oceanic perspective that serves as a counterweight to continental ways of thinking, and it supplements or challenges transnational approaches to imperialism, postcolonialism, indigeneity, globalization, and ecology.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>A recent special issue of the <italic>Contemporary Pacific</italic> titled “Native Pacific Cultural Studies on the Edge” examines uncharted spaces of the Pacific Islands and historicizes indigenous discourses about making landfall, showing how they have contested the production of new transoceanic environments. The articles in this special issue “explore notions of Pacific indigeneity as they circulate through geographical, cultural, political, and historical flows of people(s), things, knowledge, power—between islands and continents.”<sup>2</sup> As the United States and China battle over this geographical space, the message from the indigenous Pacific can be inspiring: neighboring communities have always exchanged ideas and products, often across vast oceanic distances. It was a large world in which indigenous people intermingled along numerous interconnecting routes, unhindered by the boundaries erected much later by imperial powers. Indeed, the recent wave of research on transnational Pacific indigeneity has contributed significantly to the study of both the environment and literature. For instance, Elizabeth M. Deloughrey's <italic>Routes and Roots: Navigating Caribbean and Pacific Island Literatures</italic> (2010) moves beyond restrictive national, colonial, and regional frameworks, highlighting how island histories are shaped by oceanic environments. Engaging oceanic literary studies in a sustained dialogue, Deloughrey borrows Kamau Brathwaite's idea of “tidalectic” between land and sea as a dynamic starting point by which to identify a nexus of historical process and seascape, intertwining geography and history in her exploration of how island writers inscribe the complex relation between routes and roots.<sup>3</sup>

      <p>I conceptualize the contours of indigenous communities as crossing national, regional, and international boundaries, and I formulate a platform on which to carry out a cross-cultural comparison of indigenous ecopoetics across the Pacific. I aim to offer an alternative rubric of the “transindigenous” for the study of literature and the environment and to represent center-to-center, indigenous-to-indigenous relationships and connections in the Pacific as a site of transindigenous solidarity that seeks to protect oceanic environments.</p>
      <p>Chadwick Allen's essay “A Trans<italic>national</italic> Native American Studies? Why Not Studies that are Trans-<italic>Indigenous?”</italic> challenges us to think beyond “the national borders of contemporary (settler) nation-states” and to focus on indigenous-to-indigenous relationships instead. He reminds us that conventional theories of the transnational operate on a “vertical binary” that subordinates indigenous peoples. As we work toward a new model, which Allen calls “transindigenous,” we need to treat indigenous texts “on their own complex and evolving terms.”<sup>4</sup> I move toward a transpacific and transindigenous ecopoetics that promises to preserve an ocean and offer a vision of transnational belonging, ecological confederation, and indigenous solidarity. Drawing on Linda Hogan's 2008 <italic>People of the Whale</italic> (fictionalized Makah, North American West Coast), Witi Ihimaera's 1987 <italic>Whale Rider</italic> (Maori, New Zealand/Aotearoa), and Syaman Rapongan's 2012 <italic>天空的眼睛</italic> (<italic>Eyes in the Sky</italic>) (Aboriginal Taiwan Tao), I convene a shared oceanic poetics across diverse indigenous cultures in the Pacific region. Like the rooted and routed indigenous people of the Pacific, these works begin in salt water and subsurface earth and aquifers and trace ecological connections across the waters. A transpacific and transindigenous ecopoetics bring to the fore an alternative model of reckoning space, place, and time that requires active, participatory engagement with the Pacific seascapes while simultaneously necessitating a planetary consciousness. All three authors navigate a course that is not overdetermined by the trajectories of imperialism and colonialism. All sustain a paradigm of transindigeneity, of rooted routes, of a mobile, flexible, and voyaging subject who is not physically or culturally circumscribed by terrestrial boundaries. Their poetics and imagination, I would argue, center on a restored continuum of human and oceanic nonhuman beings and participate in the emergence of multispecies ecopoetics rooted in the indigenous stories and myths of the Pacific. Their works do not merely transcend the national, international, and cultural borders erected by colonial powers but also transgress the demarcation between the human and the nonhuman, to which our modernity tightly clings. By placing these maritime works in dialogue with one another, this article underscores the shared history of the Pacific indigenous peoples and their complex historical relationships to the waters and to the cosmic beings surrounding them; this analysis then shakes loose a critical paradigm of center-to-center dialogues, that is, of transindigeneity vis-à-vis transnationality.</p>

         <title>The Planet as Ocean</title>
         <p>Rob Wilson, among many others, comments on the ecological problems of the Pacific Ocean and islands, which are so “rich in oil, natural gas, fishing and mineral resources” that nations are fighting over islands and even specks of rocks to stake their claims.”<sup>5</sup> The waters of the Pacific also inevitably become the disposal site for human-created waste, from oil spills to radioactive contaminants, “filled with the heaviness of our military history and technological blunders.”<sup>6</sup> The ocean remains uneasily amenable to territorial demarcations of national or marine sovereignty, and yet, as a planetary element necessary to sustaining life and well-being, “the ocean could become the means to envisioning ecological solidarity, if compellingly framed in terms that elicit consent and inspire an imagination of co-belonging and care.”<sup>7</sup> “Earth is a misnomer,” notes Wilson, citing Ed Delong who urged that “the planet should be called Ocean,” registering his marine microbiologist's sensibility for the ocean as a shared planetary fluid that comprises some 90 percent of our biosphere.<sup>8</sup> Threatened with techno-human endangerment, as Wilson puts it, “the ocean calls for broader planetary reckoning as species origin, instrument, analogue, and end.” Wilson continues: “Whales, dolphins, coral reefs, and marine microbes … appeal for a more worlded sense of co-dwelling” that connects beings “across various scales of lung/brain/blood/water/air/linkage.”<sup>9</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Indeed, ocean-nurtured beings are to be seen as a planetary <italic>commons</italic>. William Boelhower observes that notions of “common humanity, common wealth, and common ground” hinge on a highly appealing and irrepressible planetary consciousness.<sup>10</sup> This consciousness is often expressed through the concept of a planetary commons—a commons that is dependent on the health of the nonhuman environment as well as on humanity's recognition of belonging to local and ecological communities. The three targeted indigenous texts in this article regard the Pacific Ocean as a site of cobelonging and cohistory across species boundaries and racial/ethnic and cultural borders. Their authors view the whole Pacific Rim as a planetary bioregion and see oceanic beings as a commons that makes the ocean a geologically interactive space. Their stories, images, and legends give a deep sense of Pacific cobelonging.</p>
         <p>The Pacific ecologies influenced by the long-woven networks of interconnected reciprocity prove crucial, given that the ocean's spaces are linked. These ecologies also serve to counter colonial and national demarcation.<sup>11</sup> In his seminal essay, “The Ocean in Us,” Epili Hau'ofa, Tongan writer, critic and activist, advances the notion of forms of ecological solidarity across the Pacific (or “Oceania,” as he calls it).<sup>12</sup> Joni Adamson and Jonathan Steinwand investigate ecological knowledge and communication in the Pacific Northwest Coast and New Zealand through the critical figure of the whale.<sup>13</sup> There is even more activity around site-based work and studies of the dynamics of cultural production in Asia and the Pacific. In Taiwan, for example, a whole school of cultural study now links Taiwanese aboriginal studies to both Native American transnational frameworks of transindigenous belonging and to a contemporary connection with oceanic frameworks. This school of study has the potential to unsettle territorial ties to the Chinese mainland and reframe this decentered island as a place long connected to the Pacific Ocean.<sup>14</sup> In my article on these oceanic ties, referencing the work of Rapongan, who hails from Orchid Island (the site of antinuclear protests in the 1980s and long a part of Austronesian culture), and Hau'ofa, I contend that
<disp-quote>
               <p>through their own lived experience, as well as that of their island kin, Hau'ofa and Rapongan conceive of Oceania as a communal (sea) body, through which they can ultimately resist the imaginary political lines drawn by colonial powers. Their narratives turn hyper-modernized Pacific islanders (like themselves) back towards a perception of bodily identities as individual projects in intimate connection with Oceania.<sup>15</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Rapongan, like Hau'ofa, represents Oceanic peoples as custodians of the sea who “reach out to similar people elsewhere in the common task of protecting the seas for the general welfare of all living things.”<sup>16</sup> Rapongan's work envisions an archipelagic region in the Pacific, reshaping Taiwan as a place linked to Austronesian modes of language, space, body, and culture:
<disp-quote>
               <p>「世界地圖是什麼意思，一個島接一個島在大洋洲，他們皆有共同的理想，便是漂泊在海上，在自己的海面，在其他小島的海面，去追逐內心裡難以言表的對於海的情感。也許是從祖先傳下來的話。」達悟就是吃飛魚長大的不變的真理，飛魚是生存在海裡，千年來此不移的情感，在生出來的那一刻即孕育的了。<sup>17</sup>

            <disp-quote>
               <p>(What does the “world atlas” mean? A chain of islands in Oceania. The islanders share common ideals, savoring a freedom on the sea. On their own sea and the sea of other neighboring islands, they are in quest of the unspoken and unspeakable passion for the ocean or maybe in quest of the words passed down from their ancestors.)</p>
            </disp-quote>
Rapongan's Tao ancestors used to move freely in the Pacific Ocean, following the migratory route of the flying fish that are subject to the flow of the Kuroshio Current. This north-flowing current on the west side of the North Pacific drives the flying fish migration, which, in turn, shapes and reshapes the migratory route of the island indigenes. Because of the regular movement among the islands, Pacific Islanders conceive of their environment as an extensive, communal body that follows the pathway of the current. The sense of community encompasses not only similar human beings on the seas but nonhuman species, generating a widening circle of associations. Because Tao people feed on the flying fish and center their rituals and calendars on the movement of the fish, this means that both humans and nonhumans traverse the Pacific, deterritorializing the ocean. At the very outset of <italic>黑色翅膀</italic> (<italic>Black Wings</italic>), an autobiographical novel published in 1999, Rapongan writes:
<disp-quote>
               <p>飛魚一群一群的，密密麻麻地把廣闊的海面染成烏黑的一片又一片。每群的數量大約三、四百條不等，魚群隊相距五、六十公尺，綿延一海哩左右，看來煞似軍律嚴謹出征的千軍萬馬，順著黑潮古老的航道逐漸逼近菲律賓巴坦群島北側的海域。<sup>18</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>(The dense schools of flying fish dye patches of the wide and vast ocean black. Each school consists of three or four hundred fish, swimming about fifty or sixty meters apart. They stretch unbroken for one nautical mile and they look like a mighty military force going into battle. They follow the ancient course of the Kuroshio Current, gradually heading toward the sea north of Batan in the Philippines.)</p>
            </disp-quote>
Shortly after this, Rapongan adopts the perspective of the flying fish:
<disp-quote>
               <p>亙古以來，牠們的祖先說過：故鄉的主人，在每年冬末春初時節，皆按照其祖靈的訓語，定時舉行<italic>manawag so amomg no rayon</italic> (遙祭飛魚祖靈日，泛稱招魚祭)。只有故鄉的主人以最虔敬的心、最神聖的儀式祭拜我們；只有游到故鄉方真正體驗到我們跟人類的地位是平等的，甚至被看待為善神。<sup>19</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>(Since time immemorial, their [flying fish] ancestors have told them: at the turn of winter and spring each year, masters at your home base would observe their ancestral instructions and organize <italic>manawag ao amomg no rayon</italic> [a flying fish festival] to pay tribute and show reverence to the ancestral spirits of flying fish; they are the only ones that worship us with pious hearts and sacred rituals; only when we return to our home base would we be treated with respect as good gods and considered equal to the human beings.)</p>
            </disp-quote>
The story of the reciprocal connections between the human race and the flying fish represent the major lesson that was passed down to the flying fish from their ancestors. The same lessons of inheritance repeat themselves in the dialogues between the Tao father and his son. Human and nonhuman are tied in the circle of ecological interdependence as depicted in Rapongan's 1997 <italic>冷海情深</italic> (<italic>Cold Sea, Deep Passion</italic>). The father tells the son a mythical story about how in the distant past, flying fish jumped out of the ocean and landed on the reef. They let the Tao ancestors learn about their diverse kinds: “飛魚的酋長—『黑色翅膀』就這樣教育了我們的祖先，如何食用飛魚，如何撈捕牠們，如何祭祀牠們” (75) (“In this way the chief of the flying fish, Black Wing, educated our ancestors how to eat flying fish, how to catch them, and how to offer sacrifices to them”).</p>
         <p>The intimate connection and interaction between human and nonhuman also informs the thematic concern of Rapongan's <italic>天空的眼睛</italic> (<italic>Eyes in the Sky</italic>), in which he relates the kinship between humans and fish, ecology and creatures. Through the eyes of a whale, he opens up the large world of “the planet as ocean” or “ocean planet.”<sup>20</sup> In his essay “What the Whales Would Tell Us,” Jonathan Steinwand examines what he terms the “cetacean turn” in environmentalist iconography as exemplified by indigenous-authored novels about human relationships with whales.<sup>21</sup> As Steinwand reads novels by Ihimaera, Hogan, Zakes Mda, and Amitav Ghosh, he observes that both whales and indigenous peoples are depicted as compelling figures because of their “liminality and ambiguity.”<sup>22</sup> Just as whales constantly negotiate the boundaries between the worlds of air and water, indigenous and marginalized ethnic peoples negotiate “the boundaries of the dominant ‘civilization’ and wild nature, of traditional pre-modern and postmodern late capitalist lifestyles.”<sup>23</sup> Steinwand's argument draws on Lawrence Buell's analysis in <italic>Writing for an Endangered World</italic> of the relationship between whales and indigenous peoples in contemporary environmentalist iconography. While I fully agree that whales and indigenous peoples are significant iconic figures for contemporary ecocriticism, they are by no means to be considered as “liminal,” “ambiguous” or even opaque. To link indigenous peoples with whales in terms of their “liminality and ambiguity” duplicates the violent legacies of colonial invaders and reinforces the fallacy of modern anthropocentrism. The modern condition, as Bruno Latour argues, arises from the absolute separation of human culture from nonhuman nature.<sup>24</sup> The asymmetry between nature and culture then becomes an asymmetry between past and present. The past was a time when the boundaries between human and nonhuman were blurred; the present is marked by the complete separation of the two. The difference between an advanced Western culture and premodern/primitive cultures is that the former sets nature apart from culture, while the latter mixes them up and mistakes culture for nature.<sup>25</sup> This first “great divide” accounts for a second, more consequential one: “we” (modern Europeans) are the only ones who differentiate absolutely between nature and culture, between science and society, whereas the “others” (primitive natives) cannot really separate a <italic>sign</italic> from a <italic>thing</italic> and cannot distinguish between what comes from nature <italic>as it is</italic> and what is required by their cultures. The partition between humans and nonhumans thereby defines a second partition between “us” and “them,” condemning the primitive/native to a fittingly vanishing category belonging to the premodern era. As Latour asserts, the very notion of culture is an artifact that is created by bracketing nature off.<sup>26</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Therefore, as Chadwick Allen cautions us, it is crucial that our studies of the indigenous do not duplicate the vertical binary of “the Indigenous (always) tethered to (and positioned below) the settler-invader,” which may result in “an engulfment of the Indigenous within and beneath systems of meaning-making dominated by the desires, obsessions, and contingencies of non-Indigenous settlers, their non-Indigenous nation-states, their non-Indigenous institutions, their non-Indigenous critical methodologies and discourses.”<sup>27</sup> It is crucial to think and feel indigenous, to center the indigenous as a new iteration and a new standard.<sup>28</sup> As Allen formulates this new and critical paradigm that crosses vertical binaries, he has in mind the Native Americans and the indigenous peoples of the Pacific. I, however, would like to expand this paradigm to include the indigenous species of the ocean. The purpose is twofold. As center-to-center dialogues, the indigenous texts I examine in this article avoid the fallacy of anthropocentricism, viewing both human and nonhuman as centric. They all, furthermore, celebrate transindigenous (i.e., indigenous-to-indigenous) connection. Within a center-to-center, indigenous-to-indigenous context, these narratives take a different form from what we might expect from a narrative organized around the (vertical and asymmetrical) indigenous-invader binary opposition. They figure deep transpacific connections, free of the colonial and anthropocentric relations of center and margin, major and minor.</p>
         <p>In <italic>Eyes in the Sky</italic>, Rapongan revives the Tao traditional knowledge of the sea ecology with a story of a whale that guides the protagonist through the huge ocean. In <italic>The Whale Rider</italic>, Witi Ihimaera updates the Maori myth of how humans arrived at Aotearoa (New Zealand) on the back of a whale. In <italic>People of the Whale</italic>, Native American Linda Hogan rewrites the story of the Makah whale hunt in order to weave in the human connections to the companion species and the ecosystems in which they dwell. Breathing air and yet at home in the ocean rather than on land, whales bridge the divides between land and sea, human and nonhuman, blurring the boundaries of our rational dichotomy. In all these narratives, whales and other ocean species and beings represent a radical alterity, revealing the discontent of modern civilization, which privileges the story of human progress and sets humans apart from nonhuman species. All three authors characterize the endangered sea animals as ancestors. All three bespeak an environmental ethics and an ecopoetics that honors the rich diversity and interconnectedness of the Pacific ecology and that considers the historical and cultural bonds between human and nonhuman, environment and creature, and past and present. They redeem human animals, giving them a place in the cosmos, and materialize the dialogues between human and sea animals in the form of ancestors. In each of these texts, the asymmetry of the binary hierarchy (center vs. liminal, major vs. minor) is radically challenged, the separation between the human and nonhuman is collapsed, and multiple narratives related to humans and other species are juxtaposed to configure center-to-center, indigenous-to-indigenous dialogues and interconnectedness.</p>

         <title>Multispecies Connectivities</title>
         <p>In these center-to-center, indigenous-to-indigenous dialogues, a multispecies continuum becomes visible. The interchanges between the human and ocean species shape the multiple, divergent communities of the waters. The boundary—or, rather, the binary relationship—between human and nonhuman is perpetually blurred in the presence of a multispecies world. Deborah Bird Rose calls for renewed attention to “situated connectivities that bind us into multi-species communities.”<sup>29</sup> The term “multispecies” refers to an anthropology “that is not just confined to the human but is concerned with the effects of our entanglements with other kinds of living selves,” such as “animals, plants, fungi, and microbes once confined in anthropological accounts to the realm of <italic>zoe</italic> or ‘bare life’—that which is killable—[which] have started to appear alongside humans in the realm of <italic>bios</italic>, with legibly biographical and political lives.”<sup>30</sup> To lay bare “the emergence of multispecies ethnography,” S. Eben Kirksey and Stefan Helmreich locate their discussion within contemporary debates regarding “becomings” with respect to the conceptual questions about the definition of “culture” and “species.” Different “becomings” abound in the scholarship of the emergence of multispecies ethnography. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari define “becoming” in terms of “alliances,” preferring a horizontal “rhizome” over a vertically oriented classificatory or genealogical tree.<sup>31</sup> Deviating from Deleuzian “becoming,” Celia Lowe puts forth “new kinds of relations emerging from nonhierarchical alliances, symbiotic attachments, and the mingling of creative agents,” new kinds of relations in which “<italic>becoming</italic> transforms types into events, objects into actions.”<sup>32</sup> While Deleuze and Guattari essentially relate “becoming-animals” to human beings, Celia Lowe treats species as “creative agents” and argues along the line of the “species turn,” an idea introduced by Donna Haraway. “If we appreciate the foolishness of human exceptionalism,” Haraway writes in <italic>When Species Meet</italic>, “then we know that becoming is always becoming <italic>with</italic>—in a contact zone where the outcome, where who is in the world, is at stake.”<sup>33</sup> Deleuze and Guattari depart from “patrilineal thinking, which sees all the world as a tree of filiations ruled by genealogy and identity [and] wars with rhizomatic thinking, which is open to nonhierarchical becomings.”<sup>34</sup> I move beyond Deleuzian anthropocentricism, siding with multispecies ethnographers who study contact zones where lines separating nature from culture have blurred or disappeared and where encounters between Homo sapiens and other beings generate mutual ecologies, anticipating the emergence of the “alterworlds” of other living beings. At the end of <italic>Alien Ocean</italic>, an ethnography that newly imagines the relationship of ocean life to human life, Helmreich asserts that we are witnessing “the saturation of human nature by other natures.”<sup>35</sup>

      <sec id="s03">
         <title>People of the Whale</title>
         <p>In <italic>People of the Whale</italic>, Hogan dramatizes such saturation, creating a world of myth, songs, and prayers. In this tale set on the Pacific Northwest Coast, the fictional A'atsika people have “songs about the ocean, songs to the ocean.” They declare: “We live on the ocean. The ocean is a great being…. It is a place where people's eyes move horizontally because they watch the long, wide sea flow into infinity.”<sup>36</sup> On the day after the protagonist, Thomas W. Just, is born, an octopus walks out of the sea and appears in the village. The tribal elders do not hesitate to identify it as one of the three significant sea creatures (whale, sea lion, and octopus) that in ancient times brought good fishing and were worshiped by humans (17). The old people retain the old ways; early each morning they sing “powerful, old, and still-remembered songs” (17). Thomas is the grandson of Witka, the tribe's respected whaler and seer who carries the gifts of the spirits. Witka “was the last of those who could go under the sea holding his breath for long times and remain, so he had a great deal of knowledge about the ocean an all sea life” (18). He “spoke with the whales, entreated them, and asked, singing with his arms extended” (18). Hogan opens her narrative with the interconnectedness between Witka and whales based on symbiotic alliances. By extending his arms, he symbolically embraces the whales as relations since humans and whales share common means of communication and interaction.</p>
         <p>Hogan's novel pivots on the intimate relationship between ocean creatures and human life, thereby making the tribal community a multispecies one. Everyone is pure in heart and mind, and so the whales will come gladly toward the village. As they come, Witka offers songs and addresses them as “brother, sister whale” and “Grandmother whale, Grandfather whale” (22). In other words, they are “all my relations.” They are the host of organisms whose lives and deaths, arrivals and departures, are linked to human social worlds, as Witka sings: “If you come here to land we have beautiful leaves and trees. We have warm places. We have babies to feed and we'll let your eyes gaze upon them. We will let your soul become a child again. We will pray it back into a body. It will enter our bodies. You will be part human. We'll be part whale. Within our bodies, you will dance in warm rooms, create light, make love…. Then one day I will join you” (22–23). Whales appear alongside humans in the realm of <italic>bios</italic> with biological, social, and cultural significance. Hogan writes of whales making love and “becoming human” and thus rejects the oversimplified model of Deleuzian “becoming animal,” moving beyond the human to celebrate the human mingling with other kinds of <italic>living selves</italic>.</p>
         <p>Thomas's wife, Ruth, likewise has a close affinity with ocean creatures. She was born with gill slits, and yet she was not first of their people to share a genetic bond with the ocean, for “it had happened before, children being born with gills” (27). On her wedding night, she is said to look like a spirit that could walk the ocean pathway made by the moon on water, like the woman in one of their stories. In this story, “the woman and moon together created the cycles of growing plants, the movement of tides, and the falling rain” (27–28). A common temporal frame or natural rhythm appears, observed by both the human and the environment. Human nature is saturated by other natures. So Thomas's birth is blessed by the visit of the octopus (15–17), and so Witka, “who loved and visited the whales to ensure a good whale hunt,” has come by “a great deal of knowledge about the ocean and all sea life” (18). Water was not really a place for humans, but “Witka the whale hunter has courage…. He learned the songs and prayers. By the age of five he had dreamed the map of underwater mountains and valleys, the landscape of rock and kelp forests and the language of currents. He had an affinity for it” (19). Witka displays an emotion-laden preoccupation with his physical environment, which turns out to be defined by his biological bond with the ocean. The whale contains humanity, while Witka learns to be a whale. Humans and whales constitute mutual ecologies.</p>
         <p>The title “People of the Whale” indicates a sea lineage and the text is full of imagery reinforcing this idea. There is the close affinity between humans and jellyfish, swaying kelp forests, flying mantas, and sea turtles (36). Ruth pulls her dreams and memories into a net like a school of silver fish (37). People of the whale “come out in the ocean, come out on strands of seaweed, some carried, with their stories in their arms and on their backs or carried on the fins of the water animals” (43). The story of the whale is the story of “their ancestor,” while “all their stories clung like barnacles to the great whale, the whale they loved enough to watch pass by” (43). The narrative proclaims that “they were people of the whale” and that “they worshiped the whales” (43); what is “lost and needy and inside them all was a drive from the past they carried like DNA, a drive to return” (81–82). DNA is their genetic coding; the linkage to the ocean and whales has come as a blood memory that they inherit from their ancestor, the whale. The genealogy the Native American poet John Trudell suggests for the acronym “DNA”—“descendants now ancestors”—includes both humans and whales.<sup>37</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The A'atsika people trace their ancestry to the whales; the rock carvings show human beings “being born of the whales” (267). Born with webbed feet and able to dive in the ocean for long periods of time, Thomas's son, Marco, is a transformational being who inhabits the contact zone between land and sea and enlivens the biocultural realm of the A'atsika people. Both Witka and Marco are human/whale beings and come to represent the relationship between humans and other than humans. Through these connectivities among multiple species that are revived by stories, songs, and myths, the A'atsika people conduct their interrelational lives with whales. At the end of the novel, Marco disappears “in the bloody thrashing” (97) of a young whale as it is dying, proclaiming “we are its relatives” (99).</p>
         <p>The disappearance of the young whale and indigene indicates that Hogan is not romanticizing the fictional A'atsika tribe as one untouched by colonialism and modernity. Setting her novel in the changing modern world, she states explicitly that before Thomas was born, the forests had been clear cut and the whales overhunted:
<disp-quote>
               <p>Nearby fishing towns are now abandoned. As is the sawmill in disrepair, the forest missing…. These places truly existed, the secret places where houses were made of shells. Royal ships once anchored there; those who kept journals said the houses were made of pearls. No one sees them now except as a memory made of words. One man passing by at sunset wrote, in 1910, that they were made of rainbows, but of course no one believed him. This was also the year the deadly influenza arrived with the white whalers. The houses of shells were covered in a mudslide that same year. (9)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>This is a “turbulent place” (10) where the land meets the sea, displaying a changing history of humankind. When Thomas enlists in the army and has a spiritual crisis, his son, Marco, becomes an “incarnation of an ancestor” (38), mediating between the past and the future. Marco is the present link, as the elders teach him the old ways. “Like the whales who were dependent on land,” Marco lives “in two elements” (34). With the disappearance of Marco and the young whale, Hogan relates a story that is no less than an apocalyptic tale of environmental destruction. In fact, she bases her novel on the controversy surrounding the Makah Indians who revived their traditional whale hunt in 1997. The Makah Indians live on the shores of Neah Bay in the Pacific Northwest. Hunting the gray whales had been a Makah tradition for thousands of years. They gave up the traditional whale hunt in 1915 to prevent the extinction of the species. Though sanctioned by the International Whaling Commission, the restoration of this tribal rite of pursuing an endangered, charismatic megafauna stirred a controversy that attracted a voracious flock of news media.<sup>38</sup> Hogan opposes the whale hunt because it breaks “the sacred agreement … where the whale is welcomed, sung to, and given back to the sea with prayers” (104). In their documentary titled <italic>Sightings</italic>, Hogan and Brenda Peterson recount how they followed the gray whale's monumental journey along the Pacific coast. They set their discussion within the context of multispecies connectivities, referring to ancient pacts between humans and whales: “In the traditional and historic past, we recognized the sovereignty of other species, animal and plant. We held treaties with the animals, treaties shaped by mutual respect and knowledge of the complex workings of the world.”<sup>39</sup> Words such as “treaties” and “sovereignty,” originally used in the Native American and indigenous movement, have now woven their way into the vocabulary of environmental conservation, of protecting the rights of animals and sea lives. This frame of reference draws parallels between tribal people and whales and engages multispecies connectivities as central to Hogan's ecopoetics. Humans have been recognized as the primary agency driving the destruction of ecological communities. As the sacred songs and rituals of old people slowly disappear, Hogan calls attention to how the livelihoods of a multitude of organisms shape and are shaped by political, economic, and cultural forces.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>People of the Whale</italic> illustrates how modern indigenous communities must deal with complicated issues that challenge their relationship to the environment. Ruth, for example, recalls a whale migration that took place back when she and Thomas were children: “Great numbers of them, spouting water, rainbows in the mist of their breath. On the northward journey would be the infants, small, dark, shining. Everyone watched their passage, the tails up from water, the spray, the descent” (163). These are tales of the whales, of a magical octopus, of people connected to the sea and its mysteries. Yet, when Thomas returns home as a war veteran, he joins Dwight on the whale hunt. Dwight, also a Vietnam veteran, has successfully persuaded the A'atsika tribal council that the village should reclaim their “tradition” by reestablishing the practice of “cultural whaling.” Dwight argues that the hunt will renew the tribe culturally and economically after years of disastrously high rates of unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, domestic violence, and drug abuse. Through Dwight, on the one hand, Hogan implies that the local people do not necessarily have “exclusive access to nature.”<sup>40</sup> On the other hand, through Ruth and a group of women elders she voices her opposition to the whale hunt. They insist that the A'atsika no longer need whale meat to survive and gray whales are not numerous enough to be hunted (70).</p>
         <p>
            <italic>People of the Whale</italic>, therefore, is about mending the broken interrelationship between humans and their whale ancestors and about reconnecting the human world to the cetacean world through tales, songs, and prayers in which imagination emerges as a “social practice.” As Arjun Appadurai puts it, “The image, the imagined, the imaginary—these are all terms which direct us to something critical and new in global cultural processes: the imagination as social practice.”<sup>41</sup> Hogan's novel about the controversy of the whale hunt becomes “a form of work … and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (‘individual’) and globally defined fields of possibility.”<sup>42</sup> She calls on readers to become more aware of the ecological worlds that exist outside the “measured time” of a single human life (17). She views the cosmos from the perspective of a whale and points toward complex, intertwined human histories in the “old intelligence” of a whale's eye set in a “body covered with barnacle life and sea creatures” (267). Covered with barnacles and other sea life, whales are not single creatures but entrain a cosmos of life. In killing a whale or a person, Thomas concludes, humans kill “a planet in its universe” (267). Crossing over the boundary between humans and whales opens the view to “a species of alterity,” referred to as “the planet” by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: “The planet is a species of alterity, belonging to another system; and yet we inhabit it, on loan.”<sup>43</sup> The “planet” becomes, here, as perhaps always, the metaphor by which we recognize our collective responsibility. Hogan advances her ecological thinking in collectivities and embraces planetarity through her ecopoetics of the planet as ocean.</p>

         <title>The Whale Rider</title>
         <p>Witi Ihimaera's ecopoetics centers on the “ocean planet,” too, as he commences his novel <italic>The Whale Rider</italic> with the founding myth of Paikea, who rode a whale to Aotearoa/New Zealand:
<disp-quote>
               <p>Suddenly the sea was filled with awesome singing: “You have called and I have come,/bearing the gift of the Gods.” The dark shape rising, rising again. A whale, gigantic. A sea monster. Just as it burst through the sea, a flying fish leaping high in its ecstasy saw water and air streaming like thunderous foam from that noble beast…. Then the flying fish saw that astride the head, as it broke skyward, was a man. He was wondrous to look upon, the whale rider. The water streamed away from him and he opened his mouth to gasp in the cold air.<sup>44</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
This prologue depicts “the inseparability of human and whale as companion species” from the perspective of a flying fish.<sup>45</sup> While bringing nonhuman species into the genesis of an island's history, Ihimaera makes biotic “nature” the foundation on which forms of human social and cultural life can be built, hinging on the notion of relatedness. Like a whale, the whale rider emerges from the subsurface watercourse and “open[s] his mouth to gasp in the cold air.” Humans come to the island as the companion species of whales. After this prologue, the story diverges into two narratives, one cetacean and mythic, represented in italics and told from the viewpoint of the whales, and the other human and realistically modern, involving tribal and cultural politics. The two narratives intertwine so that cetacean perspectives permeate the human tales and the large sea world is imbued with humanity. According to Steinwand, such an anthropomorphic touch in the treatment of whales is “consistent with the Pacific ethic of genealogical connection among living beings” in which there is “a long tradition of a non-anthropocentric environmental ethic” that breaks down the divide between animal and human, nature and culture.<sup>46</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In <italic>The Whale Rider</italic>, Ihimaera fully recuperates the figure of the whale as “emblematic of the vitality of contemporary Maori culture and its unbroken links to the ancestral past.”<sup>47</sup> An ancient bull whale taught the Maori ancestors to navigate the Pacific, brought them from Hawaiki to the islands in the southwest, and became the inspiration for the canoes that allowed the Maori to engage in coastal fishing and an occasional whale hunt.<sup>48</sup> The novel depicts how the mother of the young bull whale was savaged by sharks. The orphaned whale was then fostered by a human, “who cradled him and pressed noses with the orphan in greeting” (11–12). Living connections between the past and present remain unbroken. Human-cetacean interactions and communication feature mental processes of nursing and comforting that break down the essentialized difference between humans and nonhuman animals. While other whales travel onward, the adopted whale remains, grows under the tutelage of the whale rider, and answers the call of his flute to sail to “the dangerous islands to the southwest” (12). The whale is an “ancient” figure on which the cultural identities and life paths of Maori people are inscribed. The whale took Paikea, the whale rider, to land at Ahuahu (57), where Paikea changed into Kahutia Te Rangi, produced offspring, and populated the islands. In this way, the whale rider has come from the sacred island of the east, bringing “the gifts of life to the new land, life-giving seeds to make it fruitful” (95). The ocean voyaging of the ancient bull whale and whale rider mimics the traditional seafaring practices of the Pacific Islanders. The whole of the Pacific was once connected. For both human and whale in <italic>The Whale Rider</italic>, the journey southwestward is long and arduous, “but the whale had been filled with joy at the close companionship they shared as they sped thorough the southern seas” (95).</p>
         <p>The powerful bond between human and whale in this tale is similar to the one in Linda Hogan's story. Upon arriving at Aotearoa, Paikea “gave instructions on how man might talk with the beasts and creatures of the sea so that all could live in helpful partnership. They taught oneness” (31). Like Hogan's novel, this Maori narrative revolves around environmental deterioration and restoration. The leader of the cetacean herd mourns over young calves dying from ocean radiation and contamination: while the ocean “had once, ironically, been the womb of the world” and “crystal clear,” the leader is now “afraid of the genetic effects of the undersea radiation on the remaining herd and calves in this place” (58). Ihimaera refers here to the nuclear experiments in the Pacific Ocean. Evoking the whale as an active and affective agent in mourning, Ihimaera touches on the harsh reality of the “alien ocean.”<sup>49</sup> The novel then turns from the ancient, original story of the Maori settlement in Aotearoa to the fractured relationship between humans, the ocean, and its inhabitants. Kono Apirana, Maori grandfather and chief, laments a changing modern world:
<disp-quote>
               <p>Once, our world was one where the Gods talked to our ancestors and man talked with the Gods. Sometimes the Gods gave our ancestors special powers. For instance, our ancestor Paikea … was given power to talk to whales and to command them. In this way, man, beasts and Gods lived in close communion with one another….</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>But then … man assumed a cloak of arrogance and set himself up above the Gods. He even tried to defeat Death, but failed. As he grew in his arrogance he started to drive a wedge through the original oneness of the world. In the passing of Time he divided the world into that half he could believe in and that half he could not believe in. The real and the unreal. The natural and the supernatural. The present and the past. The scientific and the fantastic. He put a barrier between both worlds and everything on his side was called rational and everything on the other side was called irrational. (116)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Koro Apirana here pinpoints the binaries and divides that characterize Western modernity. In a similar vein, the whale illuminates the traditional worldview that weaves close connections between humans and animals, and he shows how that worldview has changed over the centuries. The whale has a memory, just as the human does. On their migratory route, whales watch for danger “not from other creatures of the sea, but from the greatest threat of all—man…. Yet it had not always been like this, the ancient whale <italic>remembered</italic>” (26, emphasis added). He remembered a time when the communication between humans and whales grew, and “so did their understanding and love of each other” (26). Recalling Witka's singing in <italic>People of the Whale</italic>, whales and humans mesh in <italic>The Whale Rider</italic> in the realm of <italic>bios</italic> rather than <italic>zoe</italic>, capable of epistemological and affective exchanges and interactions. This worldview of humans once being able to communicate with sea animals goes back to the Maori inheritance of man's close kinship with the inhabitants of the ocean and of the land's connection with the sea: “This was the first communion” (39).</p>
         <p>To restore the ocean and the creatures it sustains, Ihimaera claims ancient heritage through a female protagonist, Kahu, granddaughter of Koro, who emerges as a link to past wisdom and a model of interconnectedness with the cetacean presence in Maori culture and identity. As Chadwick Allen indicates, the “grandparent-grandchild bond” has become emblematic in Maori cultural productions of a Maori political renaissance in Aotearoa. He notes that this bond has been “mobilized as a symbol of unity and political power” that has worked to restore Maori pride in their cultural heritage and assert their legal and political claims to illegally appropriated Maori lands and natural resources.<sup>50</sup> Kahu, short for Kahutia Te Rangi, is the only living grandchild in the chieftain's family. Her identity stems from her heritage—she is named after her Maori ancestor—and demonstrates her innate connection with the whales: “Can't you hear them? I've been listening to them for ages now…. The whales are still singing” (150). Her empathy for the whales grows when she overhears her grandfather's lesson about how the practice of whale killing causes his people to lose their ability to communicate with the sea creatures (50). Later, when a pod of whales strand themselves on the beach, Kahu lovingly strokes the largest whale's barnacled body, climbs onto its back and leads the surviving members of the pod back to the ocean. She remains on the whale's back as it dives beneath the ocean. This spectacular scene revitalizes the Maori ancestral image of the whale rider. Breaking down the boundaries between human and whale, Ihimaera engages himself in a kind of multispecies ethnography, to use the language of Kirksey and Helmreich, which does not merely seek to “give voice, agency or subjectivity to the nonhuman—to recognize them as other, visible in their difference” but to advocate a radical rethinking of categories of analysis “as they pertain to all beings.”<sup>51</sup> Just as Maori people celebrate the communion between humans and whales, so the ancient bull whale says, “<italic>Then let everyone live, and let the partnership between land and sea, whales and all humankind, also remain</italic>” (147). Likewise, when Kahu hears an argument between her grandfather and grandmother, she likens their voices to those of the whales: “You two sounded just like the old mother whale and the bull whale arguing” (148). Steinwand describes this kind of connection as a “restoration,” which is “not merely a nostalgic return to a pre-colonial or an invented Maori past.” Rather, “this restoration revalues Maritangi—Maori identity—as the dynamic interaction between land and sea, between local human cultures and the immediate natural world, between precolonial tradition and postcolonial survivance.”<sup>52</sup> However, he fails to emphasize the seascapes or oceanic ecology that connect the Maori to the ecosystem—not only to the cetacean world but to the entire biodiversity of the Pacific. Ihimaera restores the Pacific ecology and makes the Pacific a laboratory of diverse creatures and organisms:
<disp-quote>
               <p>Illuminated jellyfish exploded silvered starbursts through the dark depths. Far below, a river of phosphorescence lent lambent light to the abyss like a moonlit tide. The ocean was alive with noises: dolphin chatter, krill kiss, squid thresh, shark swirl, shrimp click, and ever present, the strong swelling chords of the sea's constant rise and fall. (139)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Here we witness the dynamic, sonic, and performative aspects of the Pacific, its airwaves, tidal movement, and the noises of sea creatures who “chatter,” “kiss,” “thresh,” “swirl” and “click,” as seen through the eyes of the old mother whale. The passage exhibits the performativity of sounds: sounds that reveal transoceanic relations through rhyme and rhythm, sounds that animate the “ocean planet,” make the living ocean visible, and bring the dead back to life. All these creatures are integral to the Maori cosmos of life and have a genealogy that Chadwick Allen deploys as Maori “whakapapa.” “Whakapapa” is a preeminent trope of Maori scholarship and covers the lineage of all living things: “Everything in the universe has a whakapapa, including the gods and humankind, birds and fish, trees, rocks, and mountains.”<sup>53</sup> The “relationships encoded in whakapapa serve as a primary terminology—a system of names and a set of coordinates—for the analysis of one's rightful place in the universe.”<sup>54</sup> In the names of different indigenous fish and creatures of the Pacific resides the traditional Maori knowledge of spiritual communion with the ocean. Similar to Hogan's whales with barnacles and other sea life on their bodies, the symbiotic alliances between whales and other ocean creatures in <italic>The Whale Rider</italic> define “a place in the universe” as well as entail “a planet in its universe.” Ihimaera describes the collective notion of “indigenous people” and “indigenous species” and involves them in center-to-center contacts and connectivities. The convergence between indigenous people and species renders this Maori text a transpacific model of multispecies writing.</p>

         <p>Rapongan also writes about the large marine ecosystem of the Pacific. On Orchid Island, located forty kilometers southeast of Taiwan, where he grew up, tribal men and women continue to live lives tied to their oceanic tradition, which is part of the larger Austronesian culture. He left Orchid Island when he was a teenager to attend school, remaining abroad for decades while working in the city as an urban indigene. There, he participated in the aboriginal demonstrations of the 1980s, of which the most significant was the Tao-led protest against the storage of nuclear waste on Orchid Island.<sup>55</sup> Resonating with the work of Hogan and Ihimaera, Rapongan's work features place-based specificity and the globally entangled issues of sea ecology.</p>
         <p>Close to the path of the Kuroshio Current and nurtured by the richness of the Pacific ecosystem, the Tao people lived for centuries as an affluent society with their traditional ecological knowledge developed from the environment of their home island, Pongso no Tao. When the communists took over China in 1949, the existing Chinese nationalist government moved to Taiwan. In the 1950s, they set up four labor camps, ten veteran farms and the command headquarters for a garrison on the Tao's home island. Despite all this, the Tao traditional knowledge preserved in their songs, myths and stories has continued to sustain this vigorous ocean culture.</p>
         <p>Based on egalitarian concepts of resource distribution and environmental governance, the Tao has become a prominent model of ecological sustainability. The tribal people alternate seasonally between migratory fishing and coral reef fishing. Wet taro fields with irrigation channels are supplemented by shifting cultivation (firing and fallowing) of dry taro, yams and millet. Fish are classified into three types, one each for men, women, and the elders, so as to conserve the ocean and maintain the biodiversity of the surrounding waters. The Tao also practice a unique way of reckoning time at night based on the rhythm of the moon and waves. The Tao cultivate forests and plant trees (<italic>mi mowamowa</italic>), leaving the lands to their offspring as an invaluable inheritance. Forest timber is harvested from the interior mountains for their traditional houses and boats, and the wood selected and ranked as appropriate for building decorative (<italic>mivatek</italic>) and nondecorative boats. Using their adroit boat-building skills (<italic>mi tatala</italic>) and incorporating their rudimentary knowledge of waves, the Tao produce streamlined carriers of traditional beauty. They anticipate that their boats will become good friends to the fish. The <italic>mi tatala</italic> bespeaks a symbolic order of the Tao's intimate relationship with the ocean; their assembled boats become the medium for significant connections between the Tao, the sea, and their blood relations in the sea.<sup>56</sup> Tao people observe these customary regulations of everyday life and include ecological conservation on their tribal management agenda.</p>
         <p>In <italic>Eyes in the Sky</italic>, his most recent novel, Rapongan revives Tao traditional ecological knowledge and reiterates his concern for the ocean ecology voiced in works such as <italic>Cold Sea, Deep Passion</italic>, <italic>Black Wings</italic>, and <italic>海浪的記憶</italic> (2003) (<italic>The Memory of the Waves</italic>). In all these novels, he demonstrates his extensive knowledge of the stars, the ocean, and the multispecies world of the Pacific. This knowledge was passed down by his forefathers through storytelling and singing and through physical activities such as fishing, canoeing, and boat building. Rapongan knows a very large part of the ocean ecology by name. He depicts a Pacific perception of place and space via an evocative feeling for the ocean and through a quest for ancestral words passed down as bodily codes: the memory in the blood. He opens his book with a prologue in which his tribal memory is recollected through a young boy's initiation into the ocean. The memory pivots on the connection between Chekwaga and a whale:
<disp-quote>
               <p>我那一天的夢十分的奇特－在深夜的潮間帶，我聽到有人在叫我的名字，說：「切克瓦格要不要去海上旅行，看看水世界的綺麗啊？」</p>
               <p>「你是誰？」「我是Amumubu（鯨豚）。」</p>
               <p>「你為何找我？」「嗯…想帶你看很大的世界。」</p>
               <p>「你怎麼知道我的名字？」「你的曾祖父跟我說的。」<sup>57</sup>

            <disp-quote>
               <p>(I had a peculiar dream that night—</p>
               <p>I heard someone calling my name in the intertidal zones at midnight, saying:</p>
               <p>“Chekwaga, do you want to travel on the ocean and see the beauty of the water world?”</p>
               <p>“Who are you?”</p>
               <p>“I am Amumubu (Cetacean).”</p>
               <p>“Why me?”</p>
               <p>“Hmm … I want to show you a very big world.”</p>
               <p>“How do you know my name?”</p>
               <p>“Your great-grandfather told me.)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>This opening sequence is full of ecological implications. The whale mediates generational continuity and consolidates the bond between the great-grandfather and great-grandson, who share common knowledge of and contact with a whale and, through the whale, a tie to the place and the ocean. The whale represents a temporal dimension beyond the measured time of one individual life. That time, however slow, <italic>is also time</italic>, and the author urges his reader to respect the ocean's tone. By connecting Chekwaga to his forefathers through a whale, Rapongan suggests that the planetarity of the ocean is inaccessible to human time. Furthermore, he writes of the Tao genealogy, forging a vision of the cosmos that like whakapapa in <italic>The Whale Rider</italic>, includes humankind along with what is underwater and in the sky. In one of the stories, Chekwaga's mother articulates a planetary framework interfusing the self, the ocean, and heaven/sky:
<disp-quote>
               <p>天空的眼睛非常的多，媽媽跟我說過，天空裡的其中一顆眼睛是我的天眼，在沒有死亡之前，它會一直照明著我走的路，我生命的力氣大的話，或者努力奮鬥，努力抓魚的話，屬於我的天空的眼睛將會非常的明亮。想到媽媽的這句話，跟鯨豚遨遊大海便覺得心安許多，也覺得比較幸運被牠圈選，哇！海洋真的很大，沒有源頭也沒有終點。(8)</p>

               <p>(The sky has many eyes, Mom told me, and one of them is my sky eye that will keep illuminating my way until I die. If I have a strong life spirit or work hard to catch fish, my sky eye will be very bright. Thinking of my mom's words made me feel much relieved to cruise on the sea with the whale, and I felt lucky to be chosen by him. Wow! The ocean is indeed huge; there is neither beginning nor ending.)</p>
            </disp-quote>
The whale, named Bawong, takes the protagonist on his back and continues to swim underwater. The narrative hinges on the Tao traditional calendar. The event takes place in May, during the Tao fishing season (which extends from February to June), when many large predatory fish swim beneath the schools of flying fish. Bawong teaches Chekwaga the names of the large fish, one by one—tuna, yellowfin tuna, ulua (jackfish), bluefin trevally, barracuda, dolphin fish, black marlin, and swordfish (ix–x)—opening up his view to a world of multispecies dynamics under the water. Chekwaga covers Bawong's eyes and lets him float up to the surface, which also allows Chekwaga to get air. In this communion, both human and whale traverse the biosphere and become whale-human. Rapongan depicts Bawong floating up slowly like a balloon, as “牠擺尾形成的水壓漩渦，讓浮游生物放射出多變的顏色” (x) (“the whirlpool created by his tail movement turns the plankton into a field of radiant colors”). Venturing into the microbiota that rarely figures in discussions of biodiversity, Rapongan draws attention to the politics and value of food and forges a multispecies world in which humans do not merely connect to animals but to microbes and hence an ethnography that newly imagines the relationship between ocean microbes and human life. The young boy witnesses “the saturation of human nature by other natures,” marvels at the ocean energy and dynamics, and says emphatically, “巴甕繼續的游向飛魚群的後邊 … 「願我自己的靈魂堅實。」” (x) “May my soul be strong”). The journey into the interconnected world of the ocean climaxes in an ecodynamic spectacle:
<disp-quote>
               <p>上萬尾的飛魚從海裡浮衝飛躍 … 更多的飛魚自動躍進我的船身內 … 哇！哇！我的身體也被三、四十尾的飛魚撞擊 … 這是掠食大魚在剛入夜之際進行獵殺進食的儀式，這是驚恐的魚群井然的飛奔，也是稍縱即逝的浪雲被我的首航遇見，哇！我說在心裡，是幸運也是讚嘆的心語，千萬尾的飛魚群飛躍海面一次、兩次、三次，之後海洋、飛於歸於零的寧靜，野性的壯闊奇景只留給繼續運用初始漁撈漁具的自然人。(xvi)</p>

Wow! I cried out to myself hearty words of good fortune and amazement. Hundreds of thousands of flying fish leapt out of the sea, once, twice, and for a third time, and then the sea and flying fish all became perfectly silent and peaceful. The wild and magnificent spectacles are left only to the natural men who fish with primitive tools.)</p>

         </p>
         <p>Creatures previously appearing as part of the seascape and serving as food and symbols for humans have been pressed into the foreground alongside humans, to quote Bird Rose, in the realm of <italic>bios</italic>, figured as beings “with legibly biographical and political lives,” as creative agents and active participants. Rapongan's novel can be understood not merely as an encyclopedia of Pacific fish but also as a biography or, rather, an autoethnography of sea creatures. The fish become epic heroes of a battle in water, while the human, standing in the line of the extended, multispecies Tao family, witnesses the epic event, which both amazes and enlightens him or her. The fishermen do not have active agency in catching fish; in the Tao cosmology, the flying fish offer themselves to humans as part of a seasonal ritual when predatory fish chase them. It is only in that particular season that Tao fishermen go out to sea to fish. At the end of the flying fish season, the tribal people follow the natural rhythm and switch to coral reef fishing, waiting for the flying fish to return along with the north-flowing Kuroshio Current (“在海上漁撈飛魚的季節剛結束，結束是另一種魚撈法的轉換開始，達悟人便在飛魚的季節結束後，開始獵捕底棲魚類” [30]). The Kuroshio Current transports warm, tropical water that sustains the microbes and coral reefs, thus bringing in a variety of marine organisms that migrate in the eddies as they live out their lives. Interweaving humans, sea creatures, and other organisms in these currents, Rapongan draws on Tao traditional ecological knowledge to envision a network spanning the ocean. “The saturation of human nature by other natures” occurs as Rapongan assembles an ethnography that newly imagines the relationship between human life and other marine microbes and organisms.</p>
         <p>After this prologue, the narrative begins with the monologue of an old jackfish who outlived the humans and most of his own species to become the witness to evolutionary time. Speaking in the first person, the jackfish details Tao knowledge of how migratory routes of flying fish in the Pacific parallel the pathway of Kuroshio Current. Identifying himself as a descendent of Manilacilat (in the Tao language, “the fish which shines” [“一閃一閃的魚”]), Cilat (“jackfish” in the Tao language) partakes in a Tao genealogy that conflates human and nonhuman sea creatures, stars, and constellations of the heavenly gods. Cilat speaks of traditional fishing and food distribution in Tao multispecies communities. Humans, fish, ocean, and heaven share contiguities and intimacies and form a cosmological whole of mutual ecologies. Cilat relates a time when “「人與魚」同時的生病” (3) (“human and fish both got sick”) and the heavenly gods ask Mavaheng so Panid, the leader of the flying fish, to bestow a dream on the Tao ancestral seer to give him a vision of a universal cure. Mavaheng so Panid transmits the knowledge of how to sort out fish and urges that a pact be formed between humans and fish so as to regulate fishing and food practices (3–4). Rapongan draws our attention to the interconnectedness beneath the waves and in the sky, hence describing a deeper geography and mythology. In all this, not only does he give a voice to creatures other than humans but he forces us to radically rethink the categories of human analysis: it is the leader of flying fish who teaches the tribal people how to classify fish. Rapongan does not merely decentralize human reason; he defamiliarizes the written text. The Tao do not have a writing system, but by inserting romanized Tao language into his Chinese writing, Rapongan defamiliarizes the Chinese language and reinvents a logic that pertains to ocean aesthetics and ethics. He engages in a radical renaming the biocommunity from an oceanic/nonhuman viewpoint, a biocommunity whose regenerative energy of primordial planetary belonging can lead the Tao to become born-again natives of the ocean. His poetics is an ecologically interconnected, planetary, and renativized counterconversion to place. In <italic>The Whale Rider</italic>, the whale inspires Maori canoe building. Likewise, the jackfish inspires Tao boat building. The Tao build their boats by modeling the <italic>panowang</italic> (prow and stern) on the body of the jackfish to ensure that the craft can cut through currents while simultaneously retaining a primordial aesthetic (“因而達悟人依據揣摩我肋骨弧型製作拼板船首尾切浪的Panowang，說是具有切浪的功能與視覺原初的的美感”) (8). This does not just refer to the ocean-sailing tactics of the Tao people. While the boat can be a metaphor for Rapongan's language or poetics as a carrier and container of Tao civilization, his poetics is based on his renewed awareness of native and natural knowledge, which emerges from the nonhuman multispecies communities of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
         <p>Immediately after the jackfish Cilat's story, the novel shifts to the struggle of an old, experienced fisherman out at sea. Like <italic>The Whale Rider</italic>, <italic>Eyes in the Sky</italic> interweaves two narratives: one is the mythic, premodern tale of the jackfish, and the other is the realistic, postcolonial text of the human. Unlike Ernest Hemingway's <italic>The Old Man and the Sea</italic>, which depicts an epic battle between the (lone and singular) old fisherman and a large marlin, Rapongan's story of an old fisherman named Syapen Umalanmu gestures toward ecological and planetary collectivities and connectivities, engaging both the human and the jackfish/flying fish in sustained dialogues: “沒有海洋，你就沒有魚，你也沒有智慧” (29) (“If there is no ocean, there will be no fish and thus no wisdom”).<sup>58</sup> This wisdom arises out of intimate and innate relationships among the ocean currents, the moon, the tides, the microbes, and fish (“學習洋流的與月亮、潮汐與魚類浮沉浮生的臍帶關係”) (28) and places history itself among the forces of nature. The ocean serves as a displaced site for the imagination of planetarity.</p>

         <p>The transpacific linkage contributes to a Pacific-affiliated ecopoetics of translocal solidarity, place, and bioregion. How indigenous authors understand the ocean in their imagination can prove helpful as a mode for transforming social and regional practices and for making, shaping, and gathering a transpacific ecopoetics. Indigenous texts in the transpacific context help us to see links and affects among the ocean, ourselves, and the planet. The three writers investigated in this article create an interconnected Pacific via their native knowledge, techniques, and community-building forms, cutting across nations, species, and modern and colonial prejudices. Transpacific forces, flows, linkages, and networks gesture toward expansive coalition building inside and across the Pacific and the world. “We are the ocean,” as Epeli Hau'ofa proclaims, in the fundamental ecological sense of the “ocean planet.”</p>
         <p>The contemporary predicament facing humanity stems from a civilization that severs the connections between human and nonhuman. We seek protection not only for humans but for ecosystems and the interrelated species on which humanity depends for survival. The emergence of multispecies ecopoetics rooted in indigenous stories and myths—beneath the waves and in the sky—effects oceanic “cobelongings.” The dynamic, shifting relationship between human and nonhuman is the thematic concern on which much of transpacific indigenous literature pivots. This article demonstrates how indigenous imagination in the transpacific context breaks down the division between human and nonhuman and enriches contemporary discussions of ecocriticism and environmental ethics. In the transpacific context, Linda Hogan, Witi Ihimaera, and Syaman Rapongan envision sea animals as partaking of the ocean's mysterious, radical alterity, even as at the same time—despite dramatic differences in scale, anatomy and habitat—these animals are much like humans and, in effect, embody the indigenous ancestral spirits. The ocean is, literally, the place from which human lives came. In the tribal context, oceanic animals bespeak primordial reality, that which lies beyond the present world and measured time. Indigenous texts forge an ocean-based vision of the horizon and the planet at large. They call for a renewed awareness of the human relationship to the ocean and oceanic resources, an awareness that would reinvent sacred traditions within a context of a “new and environmentally fragile world.”<sup>59</sup> By connecting these transpacific texts, we can reimagine the place of whales (Makah and Maori), flying fish, and other sea species (black wings, Tao) in Pacific indigenous ocean/fishing cultures. Taken together, these works help us envision the Pacific as a site of transindigenous solidarity while also emphasizing the importance of imagination and storytelling in democratizing knowledge. They comprise an individual oral cartography of the Pacific, full of islands, place names, names for fish, microbes, and other specific species, as well as waves, ocean currents, and navigation customs.</p>
         <p>Let us hope that these names and these creatures can survive planetary plundering. The future of environmental studies, as evident in transpacific indigenous storytelling, lies beyond the demarcation of nation-states and the divide between human and nonhuman and in a more capacious vision of ecological and transindigenous cobelonging and solidarity. “Multispecies” relationships have been translated into written form and have much to offer to contemporary ecocriticism and environmental ethics.</p>
