Gentry Boeing Defense and Space Group ABSTRACT The Neutral Buoyancy risk abatement test was conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Neutral Buoyancy Simulator facility during June and July 1995. The purpose of this neutral buoyancy simulation was to evaluate the crew interfaces associated with intra-vehicular activity (IVA) and extravehicular activity (EVA) operations for the International Space Station (ISS) Product Group-3 (PG-3) hardware. There were seven test objectives evaluated during the 1995 NBS test; three EVA and four IVA. The IVA tasks included two Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) maintenance evaluations, a Fluid System Servicer (FSS) operation evaluation and an Active Rack Isolation System (ARIS) rack installation/removal demonstration. The two CDRA maintenance tasks were removal and replacement of the upper rear heater controller Orbital Replaceable Unit (ORU) and removal and replacement of the rear Desiccant/Adsorbent (D/A) bed ORU. This paper will report on the results of IVA tests involving the CDRA rear D/A bed ORU removal and replacement test. INTRODUCTION Background The 1995 Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS) risk abatement test began in response to identifying a potential need to evaluate the International Space Station (ISS) Product Group- 3 (PG-3) hardware and components in a micro-gravity environment. A request was sent to all Integrated Product Teams to identify candidate hardware and components to be evaluated in the NBS. Responses were collected and evaluated based on the following criteria: valid objectives, drawing availability, and schedule needs. The CDRA rear D/A bed ORU was selected for testing due to it's complexity and concern whether adequate means existed for a crew member to perform the task. The 95 NBS test was conducted at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. Purpose The 95 Neutral Buoyancy risk abatement test was conducted to allow a preliminary assessment of the extent to which equipment design, layout, packaging, and functions satisfy design requirements, operability, and human productivity standards. The simulations were also carried out to generate data contributing to the development of crew timelines and procedures. These contribute to the development of properly sequenced space station tasks and complete task procedures that will achieve the space station functional objectives. Scope The test was conducted for the developmental evaluation of design concepts and for generation and evaluation of procedures for space station operations. The simulation addressed a wide range of design, operations, and maintainability objectives. Simulation provided an opportunity for the evaluation of proposed design solutions or operational procedures to correct problems identified personnel. FACILITY MSFC Neutral Buoyancy Test Facility The NBS is a 5 million liter (1.3 million gallon) water tank, 12 m (40 ft) deep by 23 m (75 ft) in diameter, which provides a close approximation of micro-gravity conditions. The water is maintained at a temperature range of 31.3 to 33.3 degrees C (88 to 92 degrees F) at a pH of 7.5. Test Set-Up Test support hardware included an NBS compatible mock-up of the U.S. Lab module made up of a cylindrical shell, 234</page><page sequence="2">standoff structures adjacent racks, one end cone mock-up, and rack face plate simulators that defined the module interior aisle-way. The lab element mock-up was placed on a support stand on the bottom of the NBS tank. Figures 1 and 2 show the end view and side view of the lab element mock-up installed in the NBS tank, respectively. Figure 1 . End View of the Lab Element Mock-up in the NBS Figure 2. Side View of the Lab Element Mock-up in the NBS PERSONNEL Neutral Buoyancy Test Team Participants from Boeing, CAMUS and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) MSFC and Johnson Space Center (JSC) centers worked as NBS test directors, NBS test conductors, principal investigators (Pis), hardware installers, data collectors, photographers, safety and utility divers, in-tank observers, and NBS test subjects, including flight experienced crew. A team concept was adopted for planning, conduct, and reporting of the 95 Neutral Buoyancy risk abatement test. Neutral Buoyancy Test Subjects Subjects were selected based on previous NBS Test experience, Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus 961344 (SCUBA) proficiency, activity as a PI, gender representation and anthropomorphic characteristics. NBS test subjects spanned the stature range of seventh percentile U.S. female to above the ninety-ninth percentile U.S. male as defined by the Space Station Program human factors requirements documentation definition. General Qualifications All individuals had to be medically certified prior to diving in the MSFC NBS. Successful completion of a physical within a year prior to the NBS test was required. Medical fitness was verified for all divers by the MSFC Medical Director prior to NASA approval to participate. A pre-dive physical was also conducted by MSFC medical staff for all in-tank participants at the start of each test day. SCUBA certification was required of all participants who entered the tank, and a pre-dive checkout was conducted by MSFC support personnel prior to clearing an individual for participation in the NBS. TEST ARTICLE DESCRIPTION Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly The Flight CDRA1 is part of the Atmosphere Revitalization (AR) rack. The CDRA mockup was constructed and housed in MSFC building 4755 prior to installation in the NBS tank. The CDRA mock-up, shown in Figure 3, represents the full size, four bed CDRA. (Note: Flexhoses and wire harnesses omitted from figure for clarity.) It was built to available flight drawings. The flight drawings were modified for the purpose of simplifying manufacturing of the mockups and to provide compatibility with the underwater environment while maintaining important features such as overall dimensions, reach and access, and hand and tool clearances. These mock-up changes created "mock up unique" test conditions, for example, fine thread bolts were replaced with larger coarse thread bolts, PVC fittings were used in place of higher cost flight fittings, electrical connectors were mocked up with correct size connectors and location per flight drawings. Cabling was installed using best "fit", because flight cabling information wasn't available at the time of fabrication. CDRA Aft Desiccant/Adsorbent Bed There are two D/A bed ORUs mounted in the CDRA. Figure 4 depicts a D/A bed ORU removed from the CDRA. CDRA Maintenance Procedure The baseline D/A bed ORU maintenance concept described the removal and replacement of the rear bed by removing each piece of interfering hardware individually, over twenty separate pieces. This was considered to be too time consuming 235</page><page sequence="3">and difficult for a crew member (or test subject) to undertake. An alternate procedure was written to support the NBS test that called out for the removal and replacement of groups of interfering hardware in the interest of having a manageable number of loose parts to track thereby reducing the overall maintenance time required. Figure 3. NBS CDRA Mock-up Figure 4. CDRA Desiccant/Adsorbent Bed ORU Mock-up The test subjects scheduled to perform this task each had a chance to become familiar with the CDRA mock-up and procedure during a pre-test 1-G "dry run" of the task. This 961344 proved to be a very valuable exercise in that the procedural errors were identified and corrected, improvements in procedure step sequencing or wording were included, and mock-up unique idiosyncrasies were accommodated. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TEST CONDUCT Neutral Buoyancy Test Readiness Review A Neutral Buoyancy Test Readiness Review (TRR) was held at MSFC on June 1, 1995. The NBS test purpose and objectives were described, test equipment characteristics were reviewed, and safety operations precautions and other special conditions were discussed. Test Procedure Overview The CDRA rear D/A bed ORU removal and replacement test followed the following general sequence: 1 . Rotate the AR rack 90° to allow rear access. 2. Disconnect the CDRA fluid, electrical, and structural connections from the rack interfaces. 3. Return rack to normal position. 4. Slide the CDRA to the maintenance position. 5. Remove ORU group one. Group one consists of: • Selector Valve ORU #103 • Selector Valve ORU #104 • Blower/Precooler ORU #400 • Differential Pressure Sensor ORU #700 • Associated tubing and brackets Group one components are removed by first disconnecting and securing the electrical connections, then disconnecting the fluid connections, then finally disconnecting the structural connections which in this case were the brackets connecting the two valves and the precooler to the CDRA main structure. ORU group one is shown in Figure 5. 5. Remove ORU group two. Group two consists of: • Selector Valve ORU #105 • Selector Valve ORU #106 • Absolute Pressure Sensor ORU #800 • Associated tubing and brackets Group two components are removed in the same sequence as group one which in this case were the brackets connecting the two valves to the CDRA main structure. ORU group two is shown in Figure 6. 5. Remove ORU group three. Group three consists of: 236</page><page sequence="4">961344 • Selector Valve ORU #101 • Associated tubing and brackets Group three components are removed in the same sequence as group one which in this case was the bracket connecting the valve to the CDRA main structure. ORU group three is shown in Figure 7. Figure 5 CDRA ORU Group #1 Figure 6 CDRA ORU Group 2 Figure 7 CDRA ORU Group #3 8. Remove and replace the rear D/A bed ORU. This is accomplished by disconnecting the four structural attachments at the top and bottom of the ORU where it connects to the CDRA main structure, removing the old ORU, placing the new ORU in the frame and re- installing the structural attachments. Reference Figure 4. It should be noted that all fluid and electrical connections to the bed have already been disconnected in the steps required to remove ORU groups one, two, and three. 9. Install ORU group three. This is done in the reverse order from removal of ORU group three. Structural connections are made first, then fluid connections, finishing up with electrical connections. 10. Install ORU group two in the same sequence as ORU group three. 11. Install ORU group one in the same sequence as ORU groups three and two. 12. Slide the CDRA into the AR rack. 13. Rotate the rack 90° allow rear access. 14. Re-connect the CDRA structural, electrical and fluid connections to the rack interfaces. 15. Rotate the rack to it's normal position. This completes the steps required to perform the CDRA rear D/A bed ORU removal and replacement. NBS Test Phasing Scheduling of all task runs was coordinated among the participants to allow them maximum participation in the specific task desired. Principal Investigators served as subjects, utility divers and assisted in the control room to ensure that procedures demonstrated addressed their particular area of interest. In several cases, procedures were modified during the test at the request of the PI. 237</page><page sequence="5">961344 Daily Scheduling The CDRA D/A bed ORU removal and replacement task was run in seven sessions. All pre-dive briefings included a review of scheduled NBS test procedures for subjects, a review of the safety procedures for safety divers, and anticipated support required of the utility divers. The a.m. daily schedule is shown in Table 1. The p.m. daily schedule is shown in Table 2. A 4:00 - 5:00 p.m. technical planning session and NBS hardware reconfiguration for the next day's activities was held each afternoon. Table 1, Neutral Buoyancy Test A.M.

DATA COLLECTION and ANALYSIS Data Collection and Data Archives Data collection was carried out during the test runs, at the debriefing using subject engineering reports and questionnaires, and post-test using the video recordings and still photographs of each of the sessions. All data and records collected during each of the runs, including the video and still photographs, are maintained at Boeing. Video Recordings During each of the test sessions, activities in the NBS were followed by six wall mounted cameras, one support stand camera and one mobile swim camera. NASA swim camera operators followed selected NBS test activities at the direction of the test conductors. In the control room, test conductors selected the view of one of the available cameras for video recording. This recording was usually of the swim camera as it could be positioned at the site of interest. The Neutral Buoyancy risk abatement videos are a collection of two hour videos available in VHS format. Photographic Data Underwater still photographs were taken to document hardware configuration and to illustrate specific events of interest to the Pis. With the exception of the hardware configuration photographs, all shots were taken during actual subject runs. Still photographs were taken at the direction of the test conductor or principal investigators, at the request of subjects or other in-tank personnel, and at the discretion of the underwater photographer. The data photographs taken during the NBS test provide close up details of design features and crew operations. Since they provide additional detail often not visible from the video views, the data photos are particularly useful when reviewing information from the video tapes. Subject Verbal Report Data Voice comments on the videos include principal investigator's comments in the control room, and "comments for record" made by the test conductors during test conduct as warranted. Post-session technical debriefs were conducted following every half-day test run. Subjects and technical observers provided their subjective impressions of hardware operations, and responded to questions from principal investigators and other design engineers present. Post-Neutral Buoyancy Test Data Sheets Data sheets generated by Pis from information contained in the video review sheets, engineering notes, and subject debriefs are compiled for each NBS test session archived. These data sheets include notes on timeline generation for integrated rack handling procedures, error data, and hardware operation during the task. Data sheets also serve as a catalog for activities found on the data videos. Data Analysis Each of the data videos are reviewed by principal investigators and the data extracted form the basis of the engineering findings reported in this paper. Response measures collected during the NBS test include task times, subject reach and visual access data, response errors, task success criteria, and subjective evaluations from subjects and technical observers. Hardware settings and positions and hardware failures were also recorded and documented. Quantitative time data were compiled as a range of the slowest and fastest times as well as the average (mean) time by all of the data analysts. Data analysis time and calculation sheets are also part of the archival package. 238</page><page sequence="6">961344 The range of times to perform a given task is useful in building scenarios for particular operations, but should not be combined with data from other NBS tests to construct operational time lines without further comparison and analysis of task time distributions. The distribution and variation of task times about their mean value must be included in models for accurate time line development. The data distribution for each class of activities is not included in this paper. Quick Look Test Reports Quick look test reports were issued by principal investigators for specific NBS test objectives. Where appropriate, results of these quick-look reports were transmitted to design teams for their use in hardware development and evaluation. TEST RESULTS Test Description Seven IVA subjects, working alone, performed the primary task of removal and replacement of the CDRA rear D/A bed ORU using a fully integrated CDRA mockup in the AR rack installed in the USL internal mockup. Three of the seven subjects also evaluated the secondary task of removal and replacement of the front D/A bed ORU, since the primary task was completed with time left of the three hour limit. Instead of wearing SCUBA tanks, all subjects used a hose air feed, called a hookah. The hookah provided a continuous supply of breathing air, permitting lengthy underwater task execution (greater than one hour) uninterrupted by the need to refill tanks. In this particular test there was also the need to access certain tight corners that may have been inaccessible if bulky SCUBA tanks were worn. The hooka provided a more realistic IVA simulation. The objectives of this exercise were to: 1) demonstrate the planned removal and replacement procedures for the rear D/A bed ORU from the CDRA; 2) assess the difficulty of significant disassembly sub tasks which would enable access to the rear bed; 3) validate maintenance procedures and evaluate the use of personal restraints, equipment bags and other restraints and mobility aids (R&amp;MA) equipment; 4) provide a timeline estimate for the task; and 5) demonstrate the planned removal and replacement procedures for the forward D/A bed ORU from the CDRA. Task Feasibility 1. Rear D/A bed #202: Removal and replacement of the rear desiccant/adsorbent bed was a lengthy procedure and involved removing and replacing a complex and confusing geometric arrangement of cables, rigid plumbing fixtures and flexible fluid lines. Subjects unfamiliar with the CDRA configuration and change-out procedures required significant prompting and tutorial assistance in executing the task. Even so, all subjects, representing the full anthropomorphic range for ISS, were able to complete the most demanding sub-tasks of the removal and replacement of the rear bed. In three of the four incomplete runs the test termination (caused by NBS dive time limits) occurred after the rear desiccant bed was replaced. 2. Front D/A bed #201: Removal and replacement of the front desiccant/adsorbent bed was much simpler than the rear bed because removal of peripheral ORUs from the supporting structure was not required. The forward D/A bed merely required the in-place detachment of components from it's housing. Subjects who performed the rear bed removal and replacement executed all the equivalent tasks required for removal and replacement of the front bed. The three subjects who performed removal and replacement of both rear and front desiccant beds performed the front bed segment in 1/5 the time required for the rear bed task segment. 3. Anticipated in-flight task frequency: CDRA D/A bed replacement is anticipated to be an infrequent requirement for ISS and will be a planned maintenance activity. Current estimate is that bed change-out will be needed at ten-year intervals. This suggests that there should be a year or more available to plan and schedule this activity, providing ample opportunity to prepare a maintenance team to perform this task. Task Execution Time 1. Task execution times: Experienced subjects, familiar with the hardware and procedures, were able to complete the replacement of rear and front D/A beds within two hours and thirty minutes (front bed replacement requiring 30 minutes). Although four subjects were unable to complete the rear desiccant bed task, they maintained a pace of task execution that was in rough agreement with the pre-test estimate of two hours and fifty minutes. In these cases difficulty in getting the test started or severe weather interruptions (lightning in the area) reduced the available work time to something less than the three hour maximum available under optimum conditions. Additionally, experienced subjects worked on the basis of sequence reminder cues; inexperienced subjects were given sequence cues plus amplified instructions. 2. Overhead time: It should be noted that the times needed for preparation and set-up for this task are not included. That is, the collection of equipment and tools, installation of R&amp;MA and attachment of procedural aids or references were not included, merely the task execution timeline. Task Performance Summary Task performance, listed in Table III for each subject, is presented as a percentage of task completion, followed by the time to complete the task. It is noted that the pre-test estimated time for the rear desiccant bed removal/replacement task was 2 hours 50 minutes (2:50). Estimated task execution times 239</page><page sequence="7">961344 were calculated by extrapolating from the time at task termination, adding the time estimated for remaining tasks based on the subject's performance. Table III Subject performance Task Subject Completion Remarks Run ID %, h:mm #1 91F 80%, 3:10 estimated, test ended at 2:30 #2 7F 95%, 2:55 estimated, test ended at 2:45 #3 99M 100%, 2:30 actual, including front bed #4 68M 100%, 2:08 actual, including front bed #5 51M 100%, 1:52 actual, including front bed #6 17M 95%, 2:45 estimated, test ended at 2:30 #7 14M 95%, 2:45 estimated, test ended at 2:30 Reach and Access 1. Selector Valve #106: All but one of the subjects had extreme difficulty getting physical access with the 8 mm (5/16") wrench used to remove and replace the Selector Valve #106 mounting bracket bolts. Subjects evaluated this task as extremely awkward, time-consuming and unacceptable from a human factors point of view. Further, each time the tool was placed on the bolt the subjects were unable to get more than 45 degrees of tool swing before being forced to remove and replace the tool on the bolt for the next twist. The combination open-end wrench was not provided with a tether and this imposed an additional burden on the subjects because they were in constant risk of dropping the tool in an area of restricted access. The physical access problem was aggravated by a restricted view of the recessed work area that forced subjects to work by "feel" during most of the bolt removal and replacement sub tasks. 2. Differential Pressure Sensor ORU #700: Subjects were unable to get a full encircled grip access to the ORU 700 electrical connector. This connector is located approximately 13 mm (1/2") directly behind the air line between Selector Valves #104 and #105, which prevents a full wrap of the thumb and fingers around the connector for a convenient twist grip. Instead, subjects had to use thumb and finger tip grip for removing and replacing the connector. Human factors requirements prescribes a minimum of one inch separation for "connectors and adjacent obstructions". 3. Pre-test 1-g training: Potential problems with Selector Valve #106 and Differential Pressure Sensor ORU 700 were identified during the 1-g training sessions described earlier. This training was especially valuable for such a complex end- to-end task, and pointed out many other problems that were corrected before valuable tank time was wasted "shaking down" the hardware. A detailed video of a test run-through was not available but would have been valuable for subjects unable to attend the hands-on 1-g training. Component Labeling and Procedure Visual Aids 1 . CDRA component labeling and marking: Manufactured and hand-applied (ad hoc) alphanumeric labels attached to the CDRA subassemblies, cables, fluid lines and piece parts eliminated much potential confusion insofar as identifying the components called out in the procedures. Subject difficulties related to labeling and marking included: a) the tiny print size on the electrical cable tags, b) the duplication of the designation "Jl" and "J2" for electrical connectors, c) potential to interchange J 1 and J2 when reconnecting them to their respective receptacles, d) absence of external alignment marks on the electrical connectors/receptacles and e) the fading of alphanumeric writing on some components caused by exposure to the water. The hand-applied alphanumeric labels were an innovation of the PI and were added for this test to clarify the identification of components. All but one of the test subjects relied heavily on the ad hoc labels to locate and identify the parts referred to in the procedures. 2. Graphic visual references: Most of the subjects required prompting during re-assembly to avoid miss-routing cable and fluid lines during the replacement of various subassemblies. Pre-test photographs and line drawings of the CDRA mockup hardware were used before and during the NBS test to aid the subjects in identifying parts of the CDRA and to depict configurations during re-assembly. Because of the "layered" or "stacked" installation of the CDRA components, photographs and graphics were provided to depict re-assembly stages in order to illustrate parts that become hidden behind other components when the CDRA is fully assembled. These photographs and graphics were used as a reference to supplement and clarify voice instructions. Subject Restraint and Mobility Aids 1. Aisle Operations: The layout of subject restraint and mobility aids (R&amp;MA) evolved rapidly during the first few test runs as subject comments and suggestions were implemented. The final test configuration employed three 42" handrails deployed in a "U-shape" from rack-to-rack in direct perimeter alignment around the aisle. One was located on the left side of the AR (CDRA) rack, one on the left side of the floor rack and the third on the opposing wall rack matching position. Subjects evaluated this layout as an effective translation aid for moving between the CDRA work site and tools and parts stowage locations. The floor handrail was also used by subjects as a temporary foot restraint while working in front of the CDRA when it was slid out into the aisle. Smaller subjects made more consistent use of the handrails for translation aids than larger subjects. The 99% male subject was able to span the width or height of the aisle, translate without aids and reach most equipment stowage positions without using the handrail installation. 240</page><page sequence="8">2. AR rack rear access: There was no provision for installing foot restraints for subjects working at the rear access to the CDRA with the AR rack tilted down into the aisle when performing the disconnect and reconnect of the subsystem interface cables. However, subjects had no difficulty performing the task at this location because the surrounding rack structure provided a purchase for body translation, positioning and restraint. Equipment Restraint, Transfer and Stowage Aids 1 . Tether use: Equipment tethering requirements evolved over the first few test runs as subject comments and suggestions were implemented. The final equipment restraint protocol employed bungees and straps to secure equipment to seat track anchor rings and handrails affixed to adjacent rack seat track. These tethers were used to: a) restrain disconnected subsystem interface connections (cables) at the rear of the CDRA (two tethers), b) restrain CDRA subassemblies to adjacent racks (three tethers), c) restrain disconnected CDRA wire harnesses to seat track anchors on adjacent racks (two tethers), and d) tether the stowage bag used for tool stowage on an adjacent rack (one to two tethers). Subjects rated this approach as adequate to perform the CDRA tasks. Note: Subjects rated the seat track anchor rings as especially good for establishing tethering points because of the ease of their use and the operational versatility in locating them on the seat track. That is, the positioning of the rings was not critical and subject anticipation of the intended use was sufficient to place them in an approximate position adequate to satisfy the upcoming need. 2. D/A bed ORU handles: The D/A bed ORUs were handled (removed and replaced) by attaching a 1 54 mm (6") handle to seat track buttons affixed to the bed case. These were installed parallel to the short dimension of the bed case and were mock- up peculiar. In general, the 154 mm (6") handle was easy to remove and replace from the bed case and provided an adequate grip to effect removal, replacement and neutral buoyancy handling of the ORU. The 154 mm (6") handle was mock-up peculiar. Flight configuration handles will be 178 mm (7") in length, which is too long to fit straight across the narrow end of the bed. The flight handles and attachment points will need to be installed at a diagonal or vertical angle. 3. Stowage bags: A low fidelity equipment bag was used by the first two subjects who rated it as poor because of the restricted opening size. The last five subjects used the flight- type IVA tool bag and rated it as excellent except for the inadequacy of Velcro tab mating (attributed to water effects). The zipper closure worked well. Tools 1. Subjects rated the tools used in this task as adequate to complete all the mechanical operations. Minor deviations from tool specifications (incorrect extension lengths) and use of an EVA tool for an IVA task (one instance) did not adversely affect test results and were quickly corrected. 2. The open end 1 1 mm (7/16") combination wrench used for Selector Valve #106 bolts would have been less difficult to use if it had been fitted with a tether because of the risk of releasing and losing the tool. Although the problem in this test was a 1-g issue (risk of dropping the tool in a narrow enclosure), the reported difficulty raised the probability of a similar problem with zero-g work. That is, a crew member releasing a tool with a velocity sufficient to cause it to float away in an area of restricted visibility and inadequate physical access. However, the principal problem with the use of this tool in this test was associated with the highly restricted physical and visual access to the #106 bolt heads. Visibility and Lighting None of the subjects made adverse comments about lighting, and the only visibility problem reported related to the view path to the Selector Valve #106 bolts (rear D/A bed). Subjects were unable to maintain a good view of all the bolt heads while working to remove or replace these bolts. Damage Potential Several areas were identified that pose a potential risk to CDRA hardware. 1. Subjects had to exercise care when removing and replacing the Selector Valve #106 air line to avoid damage to this component. After detaching one end of the line the remaining attachment became a cantilevered support for the assembly, thus making the air line vulnerable to inadvertent damage by unintentional levering action. 2. Removed cable lines were tethered in ad hoc fashion with no provisions for protecting them while restrained on the face of the CDRA. 3. There was no positive mechanical positive stop to "seat" the CDRA when sliding it back into the AR rack. 4. The CDRA retention detent pin and flange on the right side of the CDRA appeared to be inadequate to tolerate inertia forces applied to the CDRA. That is, a rapid rack rotation into the aisle followed by an abrupt stop could shear the pin. 5. Many subjects used cables and connectors as handholds. Several were damaged during test, necessitating repair between test runs. 241</page><page sequence="9">Hardware and Procedural Anomalies 1. Hardware problems: Several hardware problems occurred including mockup failures, neutral buoyancy problems and ambiguities regarding rack latching (a mockup-peculiar bolt attachment). None seriously affected the overall test results and were corrected between NBS runs or counteracted by procedural warnings. 2. Procedural problems: Procedural anomalies included improvisation, performing tasks out of sequence, performing the wrong task, dropping equipment and tools, improper routing of wire harnesses, using volume off limits (occupying volume where Lab hardware would normally be located, a mock-up limitation) and failure to follow zero-g protocol (swimming and using 1-g to an advantage). Anomalous procedural deviations were corrected real-time and none of these appeared to be serious enough to cast doubt on the test results. 3. Hookah: Use of the hookah required continual hose management by safety divers. The hookah also caused subject discomfort because of the tendency of the long hose to torque the second stage regulator (mouthpiece) from the subject's mouth (because of the tension, stiffness and inertia of the hose). This required the subjects to exert a continuous biting grip on the mouthpiece. However, the discomfort was compensated for by the advantage of being able to work uninterrupted for the long task without the need to surface and refill tanks. CONCLUSIONS Task Feasibility 1 . Removal and replacement of the front and rear D/A beds of the CDRA can be performed by the full anthropomorphic range specified for the ISS. Removal and replacement of the rear D/A bed is a worst case as compared to removal and replacement of the front desiccant bed. 2. In view of the complexity of the task and the special precautions needed to avoid damage to subassemblies this task can be done most effectively by crew members trained pre- flight using a high fidelity representation of the CDRA hardware, and with color video and photographs taken during assembly of the flight hardware for comparison with the training hardware. Recommend that a CDRA mockup, configured to match flight hardware, be maintained, with a package of video and other training aids, and kept available for training crew members for the CDRA D/A bed removal and replacement task. This is considered to be especially important in view of the long time period that may lapse between manufacture, USL launch, and eventual need for bed replacement. Task Execution Time 1. The rear bed removal and replacement task can be performed within two hours by trained subjects. Recommend two hours be allocated for the rear bed task performed by trained subjects with hands-on experience with flight-like hardware. 2. The rear bed remove and replace task can be performed within three hours by subjects with minimal training and familiarity with the hardware, but only if procedural and tutorial assistance is provided. Recommend that three hours be allocated for the rear bed task performed by subjects with minimal training and hardware familiarization, but only if assisted by procedural and tutorial aids. 3. The front bed removal and replacement task can be performed within 30 minutes by trained subjects. Recommend that 30 minutes be allocated for the front bed task performed by trained subjects. Reach and Access 1 . Physical and visual access for removing and replacing the Selector Valve #106 attachment bracket are inadequate and in violation of human factors requirements. Recommend redesign of the attachment provision for Selector Valve #106 to improve physical and visual access and bring it in compliance with human factors requirements. 2. Hand access to the Differential Pressure Sensor ORU #700 connector is inadequate and in violation of human factors requirements. Recommend reconfiguration of the ORU 700 electrical connector to enable fully encircled hand access and grip and bring it into compliance with human factors requirements. 3. Pre-test 1-g evaluations of hardware can be used to identify potential problems of physical and visual access. Medium-to- high fidelity mockups are invaluable in spotting problem areas before a bad design feature makes its way into the flight hardware. Recommend performance of 1-g testing of designs prior to underwater testing. Component Labeling and Procedure Visual Aids 1. Clear, obvious and easy-to-read labeling of component and parts is indispensable when working with complicated tasks such as the CDRA rear bed ORU removal and replacement. The additions of the ad hoc labels, attached for this test, are an effective aid to locating CDRA components and can prevent procedural errors. 242</page><page sequence="10">2. Non-unique nomenclature (same name or designation given to many different parts) is ambiguous, causes confusion and is unacceptable. 3. None of the CDRA electrical connectors satisfy human factors requirements because they do not have adequate external alignment marks to provide a visual cue for easy alignment and engagement of the connector keys during reconnection to the receptacle. Note: Internal keyways do not satisfy this requirement. 4. Photographs and drawings of the mockup hardware are an effective supplement to voice instructions, written descriptions and procedures, and can prevent operator mistakes. Photographs showing the "layering" and routing of components at various levels of assembly are needed to aid crew members doing maintenance on the CDRA. Recommend providing color photographs and color negatives of the CDRA taken during manufacture and assembly of this unit to illustrate the flight hardware "build-up" configuration during various stages of assembly. Establish agreement between the manufacturer and customer to identify which assembly stages are to be photographed and the archival technique and responsibility for preserving the imagery and making it readily available for quick reference or retrieval. 5. Add external alignment marks to all electrical connectors and receptacles, and at a location within clear view to a crew member facing the hardware from the work position, as required by human factors. Subject Restraint and Mobility Aids 1 . The handrail layout developed in this test is satisfactory to support crew translation requirements in performing the CDRA desiccant bed removal and replacement task. The 1067 mm (42") handrail (1016 mm/40" on-center) attached to the floor rack provides sufficient foot restraint to perform the CDRA rear and front desiccant bed removal and replacement task. 2. Body restraints are not required for performing the disconnect and reconnect of subsystem interface cables at the CDRA rear access location. 3. Recommend that the handrail installation developed in this test be adopted in the procedures for the CDRA rear desiccant bed removal and replacement. That is, three 42" handrails deployed in a "U-shape" from rack-to-rack in direct perimeter alignment around the aisle, one located on the left side of the AR (CDRA) rack, one on the left side of the floor rack and the third on the opposing wall rack in a matching alignment position. Equipment Restraint, Transfer and Stowage Aids 1. The tethering protocol (bungees, straps and seat track anchor rings) developed during this test is adequate to support equipment restraint requirements in performing the CDRA D/A bed ORU removal and replacement task. 2. The flight-type IVA tool is adequate to support the CDRA D/A bed ORU removal and replacement task. 3. The 154 mm (6") handle (mock-up peculiar) used for bed removal, handling and replacement is adequate to support the CDRA desiccant adsorbent bed removal and replacement task. Using a longer "flight-length" 178 mm (7") handle (placed at an angle on the end of the bed) should not affect the overall validity of this part of the test results, but an evaluation of the final flight configuration in a future NBS test would resolve any uncertainty. 4. Recommend that the following equipment be provided for equipment restraint in performing the CDRA rear desiccant adsorbent bed removal and replacement: Four seat track anchor rings and six straps or bungees. 5. Recommend that the Equipment Bag be specified for use in the procedures for the CDRA rear D/A bed ORU removal and replacement Tools The tools used in the CDRA rear D/A bed ORU removal and replacement are adequate except for the combination tool used for Selector Valve #106 bolts. A tether is required for the Selector Valve #106 bolt removal tool to prevent inadvertent loss in a very restricted space. Recommend a tether be provided for the tool used to remove and replace the Selector Valve #106 bolts. Visibility and Lighting 1. Visibility of the Selector Valve #106 bolts is inadequate. 2. Lighting conditions for this test were satisfactory. 3. Recommend that redesign of the rear D/A bed mounting provisions provide a clear view path to all mounting bolts for the full anthropomorphic range of crew members attempting this task. Damage Potential There is a risk of damage to the following CDRA components during disassembly or assembly of the CDRA for the rear desiccant bed removal and replacement: 1. Selector Valve #106 air line: With one end disconnected the line is cantilevered from the remaining connection, and 243</page><page sequence="11">could be easily broken by inadvertent force application. For CDRA components considered at risk to structural damage, recommend adopting a system of distinctive marking to alert crew members to the vulnerability of these subassemblies. For example, yellow and black "barber pole" markings are effective as an alerting graphic. 2. CDRA components subjected to impact shock when the CDRA is shoved back into the AR rack. The design is inadequate because it does not provide a cushioned stop for the CDRA when it reaches its limit of travel back into the AR rack. Recommend providing a cushioned positive mechanical stop to eliminate impact shock when sliding the CDRA back into the rack. 3. CDRA retention pin and flange: The retention assembly appears to be inadequate to tolerate inertia forces applied to the CDRA during rack tilt down. That is, a rapid rack rotation into the aisle followed by an abrupt stop may break the retention assembly. Recommend testing the CDRA retention assembly to assure it will tolerate rack tilt-down inertia forces. 4. CDRA cables and connectors are susceptible to inadvertent damage when used as hand holds. Recommend good crew training to the contrary. Hardware and Procedural Anomalies 1. Hardware and procedural anomalies did not adversely affect the test results. 2. Subjects, inexperienced in zero-g protocol, need to be reminded frequently regarding aspects of tests that require special adherence to such protocols. Failure to observe proper zero-g protocol may result in subjects overlooking significant hardware or procedural problems. Recommend making a checklist of IVA NBS procedural standards to familiarize inexperienced subjects with practices that will improve zero-g protocols and the validity of test results during NBS tests. 3. The hookah is especially valuable in NBS tests that exceed thirty minutes. Timelines established using the hookah have much greater credibility because the continuity of task execution eliminates timing uncertainty created by task interruption. Recommend using the hookah for any IVA NBS simulation lasting longer than thirty minutes, if establishing timelines (versus mere feasibility) is an objective of the test. Summary The CDRA rear Desiccant/Adsorbent bed ORU can be removed and replaced by a single crew member within three hours given the right tools and a good procedure. Experience and training can significantly improve the potential for success and reduce the time required to complete the task.
