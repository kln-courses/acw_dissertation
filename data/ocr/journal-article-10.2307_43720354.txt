<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD AND NATURE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT Nature in Modern Philosophy and Science The word "nature", in modern speech, is used in an amazing variety of senses and applications. In approaching the question of God and nature in the Old Testament, I use the word "nature" as signifying the material universe. The Oxford English Dictionary gives two definitions in which this sense is found: "the material world, or its collective objects and phenomena"; "the creative and regulative physical power which is con- ceived of as operating in the material world and as the immediate cause of all phenomena." The reality underlying these two definitions is one and the same ; and the same view of the material world appears in both. This is the conception of the material world as a closed and unified system. In the second definition, this system is hypostatized as "a creative and regu- lative force." "Nature," in this sense, is often used as a circumlocution for God. The modern Christian view of nature does not differ from the agnostic view as far as the intrinsic constitution of nature is concerned; the Christian theologian regards God as the First and Ultimate Cause, and considers natural agents as immediately operative in phenomena. This closed and unified system is governed by "laws," which, to the scientist, are really inductive formulations of the constant behavior of natural agents. The origins of this modern idea appear in the natural philosophy of the Greeks, who were the first to find a single word for nature : kosmos. This word, which signifies the beauty of order, was applied in Greek philosophy to the universe as a single whole; and the first efforts of Greek natural philosophy were devoted to the discovery of a single principle which would explain this single reality. This idea has persisted through medieval and modern thought, through the great days of the natural sciences in the last three centuries ; and a belief in the ordered regularity of nature and the constancy of its laws is fundamental to the modern natural sciences, and to the practical application of science to the control and use of natural forces. Modern man has grown up in a world dominated by this idea, and has been educated in a system in which science is, to employ the irreverent phrase of a recent writer, a "sacred cow." Here, as in so many depàrtments of knowledge, popular thinking and habits of speech are behind the most advanced specialist views. In classical physics and chemistry, nature was a precision machine which man could but imperfectly imitate. A recent theological writer has noticed the change in the scientific climate of opinion: Science is no longer as certain of itself as it once was. Natural laws . . . "are only probably true, though the probability in favor of some of them may 18</page><page sequence="2">God and Nature in the Old Testament 19 be so great as to approach, though never reach, certainty. A few years ago we all should have been willing to bet heavy odds that Newton's laws of gravity and the constancy of the chemical elements were accurately true, yet Einstein and Rutherford have proved us wrong" (Dampier). ... We no longer conceive of nature as a closed and rigid system. . . . For the principle of the uniformity of nature, it appears, governs, not the objective world, but our thinking about it. . . . The current use of such terms as "creative evolution" and "emergent evolution" shows how far we have departed from the strictly mechanical view of the world. We have to recognize that in nature freedom and creativity are primary, uniformity and rigidity only secondary.1 One professional scientist states the case even more frankly: We have now seen that six important consequences follow from the mere fact of the atomicity of radiation, coupled with those well-established facts of the undulatory theory of light that have been mentioned. These are: (1) So far as the phenomena are concerned, the uniformity of nature disappears. (2) Precise knowledge of the outer world becomes impossible for us. (3) The processes of nature cannot be adequately represented within a framework of space and time. (4) The division between subject and object is no longer definite or precise; complete precision can only be regained by uniting subject and object into a single whole. (5) So far as our knowledge is concerned, causality becomes meaningless. (6) If we still wish to think of the happenings in the phenomenal world as governed by a causal law, we must suppose that these happenings are deter- mined in some substratum of the world which lies beyond the world of phenomena, and so also beyond our access.2 Nature in Ancient Near Eastern Religions At every turn, the historian finds himself forced to adjust his habitual ideas and modes of thought to those of an ancient culture which lacked many of the concepts which are almost instinctive for the modern man; and one of the ideas which most needs adjustment is that of "nature." The idea of nature, as defined in the Oxford Dictionary, did not exist in the cultures of the ancient Near East. The difference may be most simply and sharply stated by saying that the material world, in all these cultures, was in. some way identified with the deity ; but here there is danger of over-simplification. One should not assert that all the deities of these cultures were nature-gods ; the origins of the idea of the divine are too mixed to permit such a simple explanation. But one may say that the deity, in the religions of the ancient Near East as they are known to us, was 1 E. L.

John A. Wilson finds that the Egyptian idea of nature was domi- nated by what he calls "consubstantiality." "There was ... a continuing substance across the phenomena of the universe, whether organic, inorganic, or abstract. ... To the ancient Egyptian the elements of the universe were consubstantial. If that be true, the terms which he knew best - human behavior - would be the frame of reference for non-human phenomena."4 This means that the elements of the universe, like human beings, were viewed as friendly, hostile, or indifferent: a personalization which is far removed from the kosmos of the Greeks, or the "nature" of the modern scientist, governed by "physical laws." Among the Mesopotamian peoples, according to Thorkild Jacobsen, the cosmos was viewed as a state. "The Mesopotamian . . . saw the cosmos as order, not as anarchy. But to him that order was not nearly so safe and reassuring as it was to the Egyptian. Through and under it he sensed a multitude of powerful individual wills, potentially divergent, potentially conflicting, fraught with a possibility of anarchy .... To the Mesopotamian . . . cosmic order did not appear as something given ; rather it became something achieved - achieved through a continual integration of the many individual cosmic wills, each so powerful, so frightening."6 In each of these religions, there is no idea of nature as a closed and unified system ; the unity of the material world is political, not mechanical. Jacobsen has pointed out that the relative regularity of natural phenomena in Egypt, with its equable climate, permitted the Egyptian a greater reliance upon the order of nature ; the Mesopotamian, who lived in a wilder and more unpredictable natural milieu, saw the integration of cosmic forces as an unstable equilibrium, which could and did break down into catastrophe. In these religions, then, natural forces were personalized ; and the great gods of these religions were nature-gods. As far as the history of religions can trace the idea of the divine, the simplest and most primitive apprehen- sion of the existence of powers which are uncontrollable by man is formed 8 "Die Religion steht auf allen Stufen in einem Verhältnis zur Natur und wird besonders auf den untern sehr stark von der Auffassung der Natur bestimmt. Eigent- lich könnte man sagen, dass die Religion der Primitiven ganz und gar aus Naturauf- fassung besteht, einer gewissen Art, die Vorgänge der Wirklichkeit zu betrachten und sich auf diese einzustellen" (Edvard Lehmann in Chantepie de la Saussaye, Lehrbach der Religionsgeschichte I, Tübingen, 1925, 29). 4 The Intellectual Adventure Of Ancient Man , Chicago, 1946, 62-63. « Ibid. , 127.</page><page sequence="4">God and Nature in the Old Testament 21 from the perception of natural forces. The civilizations of the ancient Near East did not, in this respect, advance very far beyond the ideas of primitive man. As long as the concept of "nature" is lacking, the evident conflicts of natural forces make it impossible for man to attribute these un- controllable powers to any single subject. So each of them which he appre- hends as distinct is identified in some way with a superior being, endowed with human characteristics of intelligence and passion, differing from man only in the possession of greater power. The deities thus elaborated are not transcendent, but immanent; they are circumscribed by the "nature" from which they are educed. There is no similarity between this primitive concept and the personification of nature in modern poetry and popular speech. To explain reality, we refer to our philosophy of nature; to the ancient man, personalization was his philosophy of nature, by which he explained reality. The deities of nature-religion are utterly dependent upon the concept of "nature" which exists in the culture where these religions arise ; and a study of this concept is a prerequisite for the understanding of these religions. Since the concept of nature itself is fluid, the idea of the divine also remains without exact definition. The identification of nature and deity is not perfect. In the religions of Mesopotamia, there were many areas of nature which were not controlled by the "gods." Instead, these areas were the province of demons, beneficent or maleficent.® The distinc- tion appears to be based on the cosmic scope of the forces involved, and not on the ability of man to control the forces. The cosmic force which is observed in the storm is not so readily imagined as present in a toothache or sour milk ; yet, in each case, man meets force which he cannot control with the means at his disposal. Here religion touches upon magic. The cosmic forces can be approached only by propitiation; the lesser natural forces were thought to be subject to the control of occult means. But, whether we deal with religion or with magic, the place of "nature" in religion is determined, in the first place, by man's ability to control natural forces; when he learns to control them, the resident divinity is evicted. Control, in turn, is based upon observation of the "course of nature," of the fixity of natural properties and patterns of behavior. Such observation is in itself a kind of control. The modern astronomer is no more able to "control" the object of his science than was the Babylonian astrologer; but his observation of the celestial bodies makes it clear to him that they neither influence nor foreshadow the course of human events. If this line of thought were pursued to its extreme, it would lead to • Cf. Dhorme, Religions de Babylonie et ď Assyrie, Paris, 1945, 264-268.</page><page sequence="5">22 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 14 atheism - or materialism, if the word be preferred ; "Nature" replaces God. At this point theistic philosophy diverges from the path which leads to monism. The philosopher is not theistic because he does not share the modern concept of nature as a closed and unified system; for he does share it. But he realizes that he is still in the presence of a force which he cannot control. He cannot locate this force within the limits of observed natural forces, and so must go beyond them, beyond the limits of the material universe; he must conceive a deity which is transcendent, and find a rational solution of the antinomy of a closed system, observed by the natural sciences, and a transcendent agent, postulated by the primary principles of reason. So Aristotle describes his Prime Mover, and so St. Thomas describes God in his Five Ways. In modern philosophy, as in the religion of the ancients, man still goes to God through "nature." The ancient conception is designated by Millar Burrows as mythological, i.e., prescientific. "It involves the personal, even anthropomorphic element, treating as the acts of a personal being or beings what a scientific world- view sees as the operations of impersonal forces or laws." For the modern man, Burrows notes, this is a false, or, at best, a poetic figurative expres- sion of truth. Burrows prefers an understanding of myth which has become current: myth is "a symbolic, approximate expression of truth which the human mind cannot perceive sharply and completely but can only glimpse vaguely, and therefore cannot adequately or accurately express .... It implies, not falsehood, but truth ... an insight more profound than scientific description and logical analysis can ever achieve."7 This sense of myth would be disputed by some ; but, without quarreling about the word, the point is worth our notice that, for the ancients, the "operations of impersonal forces or laws" were unknown ; they did not formulate general laws describing the constancy of phenomena, nor did they exhibit the curiosity which leads the scientist to search for the identity of the natural forces which produce the phenomena. Their attribution of the works of nature to personal beings, therefore, is scientifically inadequate; it is totally false only on the assumption that there is no personal being above and beyond the material universe, however "vaguely glimpsed" and "in- adequately expressed" the affirmation of such a personal being may have been. The Hebrew Conception of Nature It is against this background of ancient categories of thought that we must approach the Hebrew conception of nature. A study of the Hebrew idea of nature was undertaken by the late Wheeler Robinson, who treats 7 An Outline Of Biblical Theology, Philadelphia, 1946, 115.</page><page sequence="6">God and Nature in the Old Testament 23 the subject at some length; it has been relatively neglected by the biblical theologians.18 Robinson begins by remarking that Hebrew has no word for nature. "The only way to render this idea into Hebrew would be to say simply 'God'."9 The Hebrew found in God what was abiding in the flux of things. But this identification is sharply distinguished from the ancient Semitic personification of natural forces as nature-deities. The Hebrew showed, in contrast to modern man, very little aesthetic and romantic appreciation of nature.10 The Song of Songs is an exception to this. But the Hebrew had a profound appreciation of the mysteriousness of nature ; "nature is full of mysteries which are beyond man's achievement, mysteries which point to a divine activity that is beyond man's comprehen- sion."11 Order, which the Hebrew recognized in nature, is viewed either as a covenant of Yahweh with creatures or as "wisdom." "Wisdom was the first product of God's creative activity, for it is the condition and instrument for the creation of all things."12 The Hebrews attributed psychic life to inanimate objects and to separate parts of the human body. "There is a realistic extension of anthropomorphism to Nature as well as to God."13 The animism which Robinson (quoting Robertson Smith and Pedersen to the same effect) attributes to the Hebrews corresponds to the modern personification of "Nature" as a whole, and at the same time suggests the "consubstantiality" and the principle of substitution which Wilson has pointed out as characteristic of Egyptian thought. Egyptian ideas cannot be schematized; but, if they could, they would be classified as monism. Hebrew thought cannot be so classified. Hebrew personification is applied to distinct objects. It is a question whether Robinson's examples really show a prelogicai animism. The Hebrews possessed that peculiar awareness of nature and sensitivity to what we moderns call its "moods" which is common to all those who live close to nature, and whose lives are much more affected by the action of its forces than is the life of modern civilized man, living in an artificially controlled climate, and securing his food and clothing by purchase. To such men, nature appears as friendly or hostile. They will easily speak of it as capricious, bounteous, spiteful j its good 8 Inspiration And Revelation In The Old Testament, Oxford, 1946, 1-48. • Ibid., 1.

In addition, the Hebrews sensed a community of nature with the moral life of man, with his good fortune and ill fortune. But in none of these do I find an attitude which can accurately be likened to prelogical animism.14 The question is not thereby settled, and may deserve more searching investigation; or it may be merely a question of terminology. At best, the terminology of Robinson seems misleading. The Frankforts have rejected this terminology, which has long been accepted in the history of religions, and have proposed another designation : "The fundamental difference between the attitudes of modern and ancient man as regards the surrounding world is this: for modern, scientific man the phenomenal world is primarily an ťIť; for ancient - and also for primitive - man it is a 'Thou'. "lö The Frankforts* opinion may be thus summarized : for ancient man, nature had no meaning except in terms of human experience. They did not distinguish the animate and the inanimate. Again, there seems to be an over-simplification. A more highly personalized view of nature, which undoubtedly appears among the Hebrews and all the other ancient Semitic peoples, is not the same thing as a lack of distinction between the animate and the inanimate. Nature is personalized especially when it manifests itself as unpredictable and uncontrollable, characteristics which we associate with persons; modern scientific man, who has reduced both of these elements to smaller dimensions, is less inclined to personalize the objects and the phenomena of nature. We ask ourselves, then, what was the position of Yahweh in this scheme of nature. It is no longer necessary to discuss the proposition that Yahweh was a nature-deity; this opinion now has few defenders.16 Hence the general position of Yahweh in relation to nature may be described as intermediate between the nature-religion of the ancients and the Aristo- telian-Thomistic scheme of modern Catholic theology. The Hebrews had, 14 Eichrodt remarks: "Schon in dieser lebhaften Naturbeseelung, die der ausser- meñschlichen Schöpfung ein ähnliches Verhalten zu ihrem göttlichen Herrn zuschreibt wie dem Gottesvolk selber, zeigt sich die starke und unmittelbare Beziehung der Naturvorgänge auf Gott, dessen Handeln in Geschichte und Volksleben sie begleiten. Darum kommt es auch nirgends zu einem mythologischen Eigenleben der Naturmächte, durch das sie Gott gegenüber sich als selbständige Grössen behaupten könnten. So gewiás Israel derartige mythologische Vorstellungen teils aus seiner eigenen Vergan- genheit, teils von den Nachbarvölkern kannte, so wenig vermochten solche Mytholo- geme aus seiner personifizierenden Naturbetrachtung neu hervorzugehen, wie es ja auch jene traditionellen mythischen Stoffe nur als dichterischen Schmuck verwandte" ( Theologie des Alten Testaments II, Berlin, 1948, 78). 15 Intellectual Adventure Of Ancient Man &gt; 4. 16 Cf. Irwin, ibid., 244.</page><page sequence="8">God and Nature in the Old Testament 25 in common with the one, a transcendent deity ; like the other, they had no philosophy of nature. Yahweh as Creator Logically, Yahweh first appears as the creator of nature; but a number of writers have denied that this logically prior idea was chronologically early. Ludwig Köhler, for example, asserts that the idea of creation was late in appearing; it was a conclusion, not a principle, in Hebrew thought.17 Many older writers thought that the idea of creation first appeared in Deutero-Isaiah. Wheeler Robinson seems to lean in this direction : It is by the conflict of ideas that truth chiefly develops, and we may be sure that the conception of Yahweh owed no little of its enlargement to the clash with that of the star-gods of Babylon. The primary conception of Yahweh which made such progress possible cannot have been itself a development from natural phenomena. Its inspiration was derived from the very different realm of human history. Yahweh's ultimiate relation to things is a derivative from His primary relation to men.18 Irwin, on the other hand, says : "The basic fact for Israel's faith was the physical world."19 The truth must lie somewhere in the middle. The physical world is a less prominent motif in the conception of Yahweh than the world of history, in the sense that it is mentioned less frequently ; this does not, of course, imply that it is less important. Much depends on what we mean here by creation ; it is not a univocal idea in the biblical texts. Lack of precision makes it impossible to identify the Hebrew idea of creation with the technical idea of creation in modern theology. It is scarcely possible to find this technical idea even in Gn. 1. On the other hand, Gn. 1 contains a world-view with elements which are essentially Babylonian, and which are older than anything in the Old Testament. In both Babylonian and Egyptian religion the creation story appears in several variations. The story is universal in scope; the question is the origin of the material world, as far as this world was known. The Hebrews had sufficient contact with their neighbors to raise the problem of cosmogony ; and, whatever may have been the earliest form of the Hebrew cosmogony, the Old Testament has left no evidence that the Hebrew ever attributed the origin of the world to any other cause than Yahweh. But it is true that we cannot say how early this belief appeared, nor what form it took in its first appearance. The physical world is not the basic fact in the accounts of the patriarchs and Moses; there the basic 17 Theologie des Alten Testaments, Tübingen, 1947, 68. 18 Inspiration And Revelation In The Old Testament , 2: cf. also ibid.. 22-23. 19 Intellectual Adventure Of Ancient Man &gt; 244.</page><page sequence="9">26 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 14 fact of Israel's faith is rather the revelation of Yahweh by which the covenant was formulated. This has been pointed out by Phythian Adams : "... the complete reversal [in Ps. 104] of what we should call the normal order is both startling and unambiguous. The devout Jew is not called to worship the Redeemer of Israel because He is the Maker of all men ; he is called to worship Him as Creator because He is Jahweh, the Rock of Israel's salvation in the wilderness, and because He then and there made Israel His own peculiar people."20 If we add to this the consideration of the prophets, we should say that in the prophetic literature the character of Yahweh is more and more intimately revealed, not as the lord of nature, but as the lord of human life, who imposes moral obligations. Precisely here, it would seem, the Hebrew belief in Yahweh shows its distinctive character ; He is known primarily not by His manifestations in the physical world, but by communication through the prophetic word. Two Creation Accounts There are two accounts of creation in the first two chapters of Genesis. Of these two accounts, the second (2:4b -25) is generally regarded as the earlier, the first (1 : 1-2 :4a) as the later. Even a casual reading discloses that the second is not really a creation account, in the sense of cosmogony ; its emphasis and interest is on the origin of man, and, in particular, on the origin of man as bisexual. The creation of the lower animals is mentioned explicitly, but only to heighten the contrast between man and the lower animals. Other objects of the material world are taken for granted; of the earth and the heavens it is said, parenthetically, that Yahweh "made" them, and vegetation arises when Yahweh "rains." Yahweh is the only operative cause in the whole account. Animal life He creates by "forming" ; the word suggests the work of the potter, and this is the image the author wishes to convey. The action is described explicitly in 2 :7 ; a human corpus is molded, and life is breathed into it. The same word, "formed," is used of the lower animals (2:19), but the inspiration of life is omitted. This omission may be deliberate, to signify the excellence of man.21 If so, the idea was not shared by the author of Ps. 104 :30 : "When you send forth your breath ( ruah ), they are created." The woman is not "formed," but "built" ; the image is not exactly the same, but no real divergence can be intended. In all of these processes Yahweh is the "Maker" ; the anthropo- morphism is obvious. The author does not intend to limit the power of Yahweh ; but his choice of images shows that he has not formed a concep- 20 The Call of Israel, Oxford, 1934, 14. 21 So Dillmann, Genesis, Leipzig, 1882; Driver, The Book Of Genesis, London, 1909; Ryle, Genesis , Cambridge, 1921, ad loc.</page><page sequence="10">God and Nature in the Old Testament 27 tion of the divine activity which is essentially different from his conception of human activity. When we move from the second creation account to the first, we find ourselves in a different context of ideas. No longer is man the focus of interest, to the exclusion of other beings; the scope of the first account is cosmic. There is a careful division and enumeration of the works of creation which is intended to be complete, according to the ancient idea of the visible world: The Heavens and the Earth And their Hosts 1. Light 5. Celestial Bodies 2. Sky 6. Birds and Fish 3. Land and Sea 7. Terrestrial Animals 4. Vegetation 8. Man Except man and the terrestrial animals, none of these works is mentioned explicitly in the second account. The position of man, and the unusual solemnity of the formulae of 1 :26-27, show that the author intended this work as the climax; like the author of the second account, he regarded man as the chief of the works of God. But his world-view is more spacious. The process of creation differs in the two accounts. In the first account God ( Elohim ) is not the "Maker," although the word "make" is used a number of times ; He produces His works by word, by fiat. Creation by word is no less anthropomorphic than creation by work; but the author certainly desires to reach a higher level of representation. God is compared not to a craftsman, but to the highest of human beings, the king, who commands the works which others accomplish. But the word of God is His worker; He has and needs no assistants nor servitors. As in the second account, God is the sole operative cause; there is no question of His absolute supremacy over nature in either account. At the same time, the idea of creation is imprecise. Creation by word and creation by work are irreconcilable ; and neither is an adequate expression of reality. The word barď , as it is explained in léxica and commentaries, is used only of the divine productive activity;22 this, however, tells us nothing of the difference between divine and human activity as it was conceived by the Hebrews. There is no suggestion in either creation account that the Hebrews asked themselves whether God made from nothing. For them it was enough to say that the heavens and the earth and all that are in them came from Yahweh alone. On the other hand, a comparison of Genesis with the Babylonian Entuma Elish shows that the Genesis creation 22 Cf. most recently Gruenthaner, C.B.Q., Vol. 9 (1947), 49-50.</page><page sequence="11">28 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 14 account rejects explicitly the idea of a primeval uncreated principle as it is exhibited in the Enuma Elish ; for their view of the structure of the material universe was identical with that of the Babylonians.28 Had they asked themselves whether the productive activity of Yahweh presupposed any material cause, they would, by the logic of their idea of the divine supremacy, have denied it ; but to ask such a question belongs to a phil- osophy of nature. The Hebrews did not ask it, because they had no such philosophy. The demands of Hebrew belief were met if they excluded from their cosmogony the theogony which was characteristic of Egyptian and Babylonian myths. Creation and Chaos In rejecting the primeval uncreated principle, the Hebrews did not abandon it altogether. There are a number of allusions in the Old Testament to creation imagined as a victory of the creative deity over a chaotic monster.24 This myth of a combat between the creative deity and the chaotic monster appears in several forms in both Babylonian and Canaanite literature. In the Enuma Elish "mother Tiamat, who gave birth to them all," is the spouse of Apsu; this is the primeval pair from whom all the gods are generated. The combat arises when Apsu is slain by Ea, and Tiamat resolves in revenge to kill all her offspring. Marduk is chosen as champion of the gods, defeats and kills Tiamat, and from her gigantic carcass makes the earth and the sky. In the Ugaritic tablets, Aleyan Baal engages in combat with an adversary Mot, and with a draconic adversary called Sea-River.26 The verbal parallels between the Ugaritic tablets and several Old Testament passages make it impossible to suppose anything but direct dependence.26 But it should be noticed that these allusions occur only in poetry, and that no consistent form of the myth can be reconstructed from the Hebrew allusions. Consequently, it is not accurate to speak of the Hebrew "myth" of creation. But the Hebrew idea of creation, precisely because it was vague and undefined, did not forbid the employment of certain mythological traits as poetic embellishments. For the myth, as it was adapted by the Hebrews, was another expression of the divine supremacy and independence ; philosophical reflection would 23 Deimel, " Enuma Elish" und Hexaemeron , Rome, 1934, 83-84; Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, Chicago, 1942, 83-86. 24 Ps. 74:13-15; 89:10-11; Isa. 27:1; 51:9-10; Job 9:13; 26:12-13; 38:8-11; cf.

Theological Studies 11 (1950), 278.</page><page sequence="12">God and Nature in the Old Testament 29 not admit such an expression, but the Hebrews were innocent of philo- sophical reflection. Köhler asserts that the idea of Yahweh as a warrior- hero (Ps. 89:14; Isa. 51:9; cf. also Ex. 15:3) is derived from His victory over chaos in creation, and not from His deeds on behalf of Israel.27 This is, perhaps, too simply stated; in the mighty deeds of Yahweh for His people, Yahweh appears as the lord of nature. 'But Köhler's point is well made; the title of warrior-hero does imply that Yahweh is lord of nature. Creation As a Continuous Activity The myth, besides, permitted the Hebrew poet to voice an idea which is characteristic of the Old Testament: that creation is a continuous activity.28 The "rest" of God after His creative work (Gen. 2:2) is a theological invention, intended to adapt the works of creation to the week and the Sabbath.29 In the myth, the monster of chaos is identified with the sea or the primeval abyss, which is sometimes said to be slain (Ps. 73:13-14, 89:11; Isa. 51:9-10, 27:1), sometimes said to be bound (Ps. 89:10, 104:6-8; Job 26:12, 38:8-11). In the latter conception, the monster is kept under constant restraint ; were Yahweh to relax its bonds, the world would relapse into chaos. In this employment of mythological allusion there is a poetic expression of a profound truth. The same truth is expressed elsewhere. Each manifestation of the dominion of Yahweh over nature may be conceived as a reenactment of the drama of creation. The forces of nature were not apprehended by the Hebrews as static, nor, again, as mechanical; in each of their operations they are moved by the power of Yahweh. Yahweh brings forth the host of heaven, by number, and calls them by name (Isa. 40:26). He does this not only in their first creation, but in their daily appearance; for He marshals the host of heaven (Isa. 45:12), and when He calls to them, they arise together (Isa. 48:13). It is He who makes dawn and darkness ; He turns dense darkness into dawn, and darkens day into night (Amos 4:13, 5:8). He measures the waters in the hollow of His hand (Isa. 40:12) ; He set the sand as a boundary for the sea, as an everlasting barrier (Jer. 5 :22). The life which He gave He sustains ; He gives breath to the people upon the earth, and spirit to those who walk in it (Isa. 42 :5). It is He who brings forth fountains in the valleys for the beasts of the field to drink. "He makes grass grow for the cattle, and herbage for the 21 Theologie des Alten Testaments , 73. 28 Cf.

The animals wait upon Him for their food in due season. When He gives, they gather ; when He opens His hand, they are filled with good things. When He takes away His breath, they die and return to dust. But when He sends forth His breath, they are created; and thus He renews the face of the earth (Ps. 104:10, 14-15, 28-30). Thus the Hebrew was not blind to order and regularity and teleology in nature ; but for him these were identified with the present activity of the divine creative will. Schultz has said : "Between the order of nature and the will of the living God there is no antagonism; the two are the same."80 Order and Wisdom In Creation But the creative will is not arbitrary or capricious ; its order and regularity the Hebrews saw as wisdom. Wisdom was the first of the works of God, before all creation; and when He established the heavens and the earth, wisdom was with Him (Prov. 8:22 if.).81 "Yahweh by wisdom founded the earth, and by insight established the heavens; by His knowledge the depths are cleft open, and the clouds drip dew" (Prov. 3:19-20). The author of Ps. 104 admires the wisdom by which God provides food and shelter for man and for so many species of animals: wild and domestic, birds and beasts, on the earth and in the water. "How many are your works, Yahweh! In wisdom have you made them all" (Ps. 104:24). The cycle of birth and death (ibid. 28-30), by which the life of the world is constantly renewed, is a work of divine wisdom.82 There is a magnificent 30 Old Testament Theology (Eng. tr.) II, Edinburgh, 1895, 188. 31 The instrumental function of wisdom in creation appears much more clearly if, with Gk Syr Vg, 'amman is read in Prov. 8:30 instead of the difficult ' amon. The word, meaning "master-craftsman," appears elsewhere only in Cant. 7:2, and seems to be suggested by apļio^ovtra of Gk and componens of Vg. The Syr word is not given in Brockelmann; according to Toy, the word suggests "arranger." This meaning in Prov. 8 :30 is accepted, on the basis of the VV., in the older lexx. of Brown-Driver- Briggs and König, and by Eichrodt, Theologie des Alten Testaments II, 40, among recent writers; but it is rejected by Gesenius-Buhl and in the newer works of Zorell and Köhler. Cf. also the defense of this sense by Moriarty, Verbum Domini 27 (1949), 291' ff. The reading 'amun, "foster-child," "darling," is proposed by Toy, Proverbs (ICC), N. Y., 1899, Wiesmann, Das Buch der Spruche (HSAT), Bonn, 1923, Gemser, Sprüche Salomos (HAT), Tübingen, 1934, and Beer in BHK.8 The context appears to favor the reading 'amun; the following words, "I was a delight day by day, playing in His presence, playing in the world," suggest not the craftsman, but rather the small child accompanying the workman. Against this weight of opinion, one should not too facilely educe the instrumental function of wisdom in creation from this text. 82 There is an undeniable similarity, in conception and execution, between Ps. 104</page><page sequence="14">God and Nature in the Old Testament 31 hymn of the divine creative wisdom in Job 38-39, where similar works are enumerated: the foundation of the earth, imagined as a vast edifice; the enclosure of the sea ; the succession of dawn and dusk, light and dark- ness ; the storehouses of snow and hail ; the direction of the wind, the rain, the lightning; the courses of the constellations; the provision of food for wild beasts, and the mystery of their birth ; the creation of wild animals such as the wild ass, the wild ox, and the ostrich, which man cannot subdue or domesticate. Wisdom is here more than cleverness; it is a directive intelligence, which maintains order and harmony among so many conflicting and divergent agents. The wisdom of the peasant, who brings forth grain from the ground, is taught him by Yahweh : "This also comes from Yahweh of hosts, whose counsel is marvelous, whose wisdom is great" (Isa. 28:23-29). Wheeler Robinson has remarked that wisdom is the nearest approach in the Old Testament to a philosophical unification of nature: "It is subjective, in the sense that it is God's, and proceeds from Him, yet it is also objective, in the sense that He employs it in the creation and conservation of both Nature and human life."85 He also points out that the idea of order in nature is expressed by the Hebrews as a "covenant" (çf. Hos. 2:18; Job 5 :23) ; but this image is less common and characteristic than the idea of wisdom. Wisdom is not purely the order of nature, and certainly not a mechanical order; but nature, in its regularity, its unity amid diversity, constantly demonstrates a superhuman intelligence and the constant and effective direction of a superhuman will. Here is manifest the highly personalized conception of nature which is characteristic of the Old Testament.34 and Ikhnaton's hymn to Aton. An English translation of the Egyptian poem may be found in Steindorff and Seele, When Egypt Ruled The East , Chicago, 1942, 214-215, Wilson in Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts, 370-371, Breasted, The Dawn Of Conscience , N. Y., 1933, 281-286. Breasted prints Ps. 104 :20-26 in a parallel column. Among recent writers Gressmann (in Simpson, The Psalmists, Oxford, 1926, 18-20) and Oesterley ( The Psalms II, London, 1939, 440) argue for a direct dependence of the psalm on the Egyptian poem. Schmidt ( Die Psalmen, Tübingen, 1934, 191) thinks that it was "easily possible that the song was known to the Psalmist and influenced him." Buttenwieser vigorously denies dependence {The Psalms, Chicago, 1938, ( 158-161). He notes that "in both poems creation is described as continuous, as renewed day by day." Calés ( Le Livre des Psaumes II, Paris, 1936, 271) sees no reason to suppose that the Egyptian served as a model for the Hebrew. Butten- wieser's criticism of the alleged parallels seems valid. The similarity is primarily doe to the identity of subject; and even those authors who defend direct dependence note that the Egyptian hymn is addressed to the solar disk. 38 Inspiration And Revelation In The Old Testament. 10-11. 84 Eichrodt alone ( Theologie des Alten Testaments II, 79-83) seems to find in the Old Testament a view of nature as a whole - "the concept of the cosmos as an</page><page sequence="15">32 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 14 Creation in Ancient Religious Myths Creation by word and creation by work both appear in Egyptian and Babylonian literature. In the older and simpler cosmogonies, the creative deity was a "Progenitor" and a "Maker." But there is, in the Memphite theology, a far more reflective conception of Ptah as the deity who created by word. John A. Wilson says: (The earlier creation texts) have been more strictly in physical terms: the god separating earth from sky or giving birth to air and moisture. This new text turns as far as the Egyptian could turn toward a creation in philosophical terms: the thought which came into the heart of a god and the commanding utterance which brought that thought into reality. This creation by thought conception and speech delivery has its experiential background in human life: the authority of a ruler to create by command.85 The creation by word in Gen. 1 lacks the involved idea of "thought con- ception and speech delivery" of the Memphite theology; yet, like it, it has its "experiential background" in "the authority of a ruler to create organism with its own laws of life;" and this concept he finds in Gen. 1 only. He traces a development in the idea of regularity in nature from the ancient Israelite idea of the interplay of divine and human action to the idea of "law." But Eichrodt does not mean that this idea of nature as a whole is identical with the modern idea of nature; for in any Hebrew view "there is a constant relation to the creator as the cause and source of cosmic life." The "laws" of nature which are mentioned in the prophetical literature are not objective, like the modern "physical laws"; they are subjective, expressing the constancy and order of the creative will as opposed to the arbitrary will of man. Thus, except for the interpretation of Gn. 1, these pages of the distinguished theologian are not opposed to what is set forth here. As for the Hexaemeron, it seems to me, with all due respect to the learned author, that his interpretation does not justify me in removing this chapter from the general con- text of Hebrew thought - the same context which Eichrodt himself establishes - but that it is rather to be interpreted in accordance with that context. Eichrodt himself, in conclusion, treats the two ideas as complementary rather than antithetic: "Es ist für die alttestamentliche Naturanschauung bezeichnend, dass ihr eine Kombination der beiden Grundtypen der Betrachtung gelang. Sie vermochte in der Erkenntnis der Eigengesetzlichkeit der Natur bis zu ihrer völligen Fremdheit menschlichem Verstehen gegenüber vorzudringen, ohne doch Gottes unmittelbares Wirken im Natur geschehen je aufzugeben. Dadurch entging sie den Gefahren, die sich an die Ausbildung jener Typen zu je einer in sich geschlossenen Weltansicht in besonderer Weise knüpfen, nämlich einmal der äusserlichen Trennung zwischen Gott und Welt in der Art des Deismus, der nur den Gott kennt, der Von aussen stossť und die Welt ihren eigenen Gesetzen überlässt, und zum andern der enthusiastischen Mythisierung der Natur, die ihre Gesetzmässigkeit in göttliche Willküracte auflöst und den grossen Schöp- fungsordnungen keinerlei Offenbarungswert mehr zuerkennt." 86 Intellectual Adventure Of Ancient Man, 56; cf. also Frankfort, Kingship And The Gods , Chicago, 1948, 27-30. Wilson's version of the text of the Memphite theology is now available in Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts , 4-6.</page><page sequence="16">God and Nature in the Old Testament 33 by command." Marduk, the creative deity of the Enuma Elish, is a "Maker," as are other creative deities in Mesopotamian sources. It is true that Marduk, in Tablet IV, demonstrates his creative power by anni-* hilating and restoring a garment "by the command of his mouth."86 As Gunkel remarks, this is a conjurer's word,*37 Marduk's display is the dis- appearing act of the stage magician. There is no similarity between this and the formula of Genesis: "And God said: Let there be light; and light came into being." Hence, while the idea of creation by word and that of creation by work are found elsewhere, they assume a distinctive form in the Hebrew creation accounts. The difference between the creative deity of the Hebrews and the crea- tive deities of other ancient peoples lies, as has often been pointed out, in the supreme independence and transcendence of Yahweh, and in His unicity. I have remarked above that the divine independence is implied in the more homely account of Gen. 2 as well as in the more refined account of Gen. 1. The divine transcendence is not so obviously implied; but Gen. 2 is in accord with Old Testament ideas. Here, as elsewhere, Yahweh is not a nature-deity. He is likewise the only agent. In polytheism, the idea of the creative deity becomes hopelessly confused as the positions of dif- ferent deities, each of whom has a title to creation, are reconciled. Thus, in older Mesopotamian cosmogonies, Anu, Enlil, and Ea were creative deities ; in the Enuma Elish creation is attributed to Marduk.88 In Egypt also several deities are called creators.39 Furthermore, in these religions a cosmogony is, in its initial stage, a theogony. The utter absence of such features in the Hebrew accounts must be deliberate; and few pages of the Old Testament are better calculated to show the loftiness of the Hebrew idea of God than the creation accounts. Yahweh Lord of the Storm As the creator, sustainer, and lord of nature, Yahweh manifests Himself in natural phenomena. And while no area of natural forces is excluded from His domain, it is true that the Hebrews saw Him by preference in some phenomena and ignored His presence in others. A page of A.

One prefers to say His relation to nature rather than to the universe, because the book does not bring Jehovah into a close connection with creation, and does not conceive Him as holding a definite relation to the world as a whole. Possibly the idea of the world as a whole has not risen before the thought of the writers; certainly, if it has, it does not bulk largely in their minds, for Jahveh's relation to the world is not conceived as a relation to the world- whole, but rather as a relation to the individual nature-phenomena and especially to the terrible aspects of nature which have always attracted men's awe. Now, when Jahveh brings earthquake and storm, He always stands behind the nature-phenomenon, and is never contained in it. The very variety of events with which He can be brought into connection is the sufficient proof that He is identical with none. He sends pestilence and causes drought; He rains down fire, and is attended by earthquake. If Jahveh were conceived as the god of the storm, it would be difficult to account for His association with pestilence. The fact that He is associated with all these natural events shows that He is contained in none, but is con- ceived as able to use each in order to fulfil His will. . . . These phenomena of nature which have always roused men's interest, especially at a certain stage of their mental and religious development, claimed the attention of the Hebrews also as subjects for religious thought, were referred by them to the one God of the people, and could not be conceived by them as escaping, any more than aught else, from His control. The significant matter is that they are always believed to be under His control. Jahveh's relation to the cosmos, and especially to the nature-phenomena, has not been a subject of reflection; but Jahveh's nature is so conceived and so thoroughly held aloof from being contained in nature that the people are sure, when the period of reflection comes, to follow the higher line of theological thought.40 With the caution indicated by Welch in mind, we may notice that Yah weh is often associated with the storm. So many and so striking are the biblical allusions to this that some have thought that Yahweh was originally a storm-god.41 The thunder is the voice of Yahweh (Ps. 29:3-9). It is in a storm that Yahweh rescues His people from Egypt (Ps. 77:16-20). He speaks and raises the storm-wind; He stills the storm to a whisper (Ps. 107 :25-29) . He comes from afar in blazing anger, amid heavily rising banks of clouds; He makes His glorious voice heard, and the descent of His arm seen, in furious anger, and flame of devouring fire, amid cloudburst, 40 The Religion Of Israel Under The Kingdom , Edinburgh. 1912, 11-12. 41 Stade, Biblische Theologie des Alten Testaments , Tübingen, 1905, 17, 94-95, and, more recently, Matthews, The Religious Pilgrimage Of Israel , N.Y. 1947, 56. Eichrodt ( Theologie des Alten Testaments II, Iff.) submits this view to criticism as a "false isolation" of the incontestably remarkable fact that Yahweh appears not in the benevolent forces of nature, but in the storm.</page><page sequence="18">God and Nature in the Old Testament 35 and rainstorm, and hail (Isa. 30:27, 30). In the storm and tempest is His way, and clouds are the dust of His feet (Nah. 1 :3). He is also lord of the earthquake; the epithet which the Greeks applied to Poseidon, "Earth- Shaker/' is apt to Yahweh as He appears in Hebrew poetry. The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt (Nah. 1:5). He stretches out His hand, and the mountains quake (Isa. 5 :25). He makes the cedars of Lebanon skip like a calf, Lebanon and Hermon like a wild ox (Ps. 29 :6). It is He who sends forth wind and rain from their storehouses. He cleaves a channel for the torrent, and a way for the thunderbolt; He sends forth the lightning, and tilts the clouds (Job 38:25, 35, 37). The Storm -Theophany It is in the great theophanies that Yahweh appears most clearly as the lord of the storm (Jud. 4:4-5; Ps. 18:8-16, 68:7-9; Hab. 3:3-15). The theophany of Sinai, in which the covenant was established between Yahweh and His people, came as a storm-theophany. "There were thunderclaps and flashes of lightning and a dense cloud and the sound of a trumpet, very loud. . . . Mount Sinai was all smoke when Yahweh came down upon it in fire, and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a kiln" (Ex. 19:16, 19). This historic event has left its traces upon the poetic theophanies. Even in the theophany of Ez. 1 Yahweh approaches in a storm-cloud, although the prophet forgets it when he begins to describe the chariot. The theophany of Ps. 18:8r16 may be taken as typical: The earth quivered and rocked, And the foundations of the mountains trembled, And rocked when He was angry. Smoke arose from His nostrils, And fire devoured from His mouth; Coals were set ablaze from it. He bowed the heavens, and came down; Thick darkness was beneath His feet. He rode upon a cherub, and flew; He sped on the wings of the wind. He made darkness His lair; His pavilion about Him was the darkness of the heavens. Before Him moved dense clouds, Hailstones, and coals of fire. Yahweh thundered from the heavens, The Most High uttered His voice. He shot forth His arrows, and scattered them; His thunderbolts, and He routed them; The depths of the sea were laid bare, And the foundations of the earth were uncovered, By your wrath, Yahweh, By the fierce blast of your anger.</page><page sequence="19">36 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 14 It is as the helper of His people that Yahweh most frequently appears in the storm; He is most terrible when He scatters the enemies of Israel. Against the Canaanites, He appears from Edom when the earth quaked and the clouds dripped water, when the stars from their courses fought against Sisera (Jud. 4:4, 20). He cast great hail-stones from heaven upon the Amorites, and slew more of them than Israel slew by the sword (Jos. 10:11). The clouds are His chariot, the winds His messengers, the light- ning His minister (Ps. 103:4). He is the "Rider of the Clouds" (Ps. 68:4), an epithet applied also to the Canaanite Aleyan Baal.42 It seems impossible to reach any decision of the question whether the phenomena of the theophany are those of the storm or the volcanic eruption. A. C. Welch, who insists that it is a volcanic eruption, remarks with some acidity that hills are not in the habit of melting like wax before a thunder- storm.43 Those who interpret the theophany in terms of the storm urge, with some plausibility, that the allusions to volcanic phenomena are obscure, nor do they appear in all the theophanies ; it is difficult, besides, to discover the volcanic area where the Hebrews would have become acquainted with volcanic phenomena. One might account for both by supposing that the theophany combines phenomena of storm and earthquake. The theophany is a literary creation of the poeťs imagination, not a description of an actual event. For the poet, the essential idea is the presence and activity of Yahweh in nature, not the precise identification of the phenomena. Thus Calés remarks of Ps. 18:8-16: "Il n'y faut pas chercher une allégorie bien symétriquement et logiquement construite, comme la concevrait une imagination occidentale. Elle emprunte ses traits à diverses sources : théophanie sinaitique ; grandes commotions cosmiques ; ouragans et orages formidables, comme il s'en produit dans les déserts rocheux du Sinai ou de la Palestine; peut-être, plus ou moins indirectement, grands poèmes cosmogoniques de Babylonie, etc."44 The classical model of the theophany appears to be the theophany of Sinai, as it was related in Hebrew tradition. It is certainly the oldest form of the theophany, and no other reason suggests itself why Yahweh should by preference be seen as present and active in the storm except the traditional association of the storm-theophany and the covenant. It would be only 42 Reading rokeb ba'araphoth ; cf. Ginsberg, Journal Of Biblical Literature 62 (1943), 112; J. H. Patton, Canaanite Parallels In The Book of Psalms , Baltimore, 1944, 20. This reading is recommended by the Canaanite verbal parallel and by such passages as Ps. 18:10; 104:3. It does not appear, however, even in the most recent commentaries. 48 The Psalter , Oxford, 1926, 39. 44 Le Livre des Psaumes I, 230.</page><page sequence="20">God and Nature in the Old Testament 37 natural for the Hebrew to think of Yahweh manifesting Himself in the form and circumstances of the event which was of such historic significance for His people. On the other hand, the details of the theophanies are expanded beyond the details of the Sinai narratives. It is possible that they are affected also by the account of the passage of the Red Sea, although these are more difficult to trace. Some details are borrowed from foreign sources; but there is no pattern in extra-biblical literature after which the biblical theophany is formed. In the Gilgamesh Epic, "... a black cloud came up from out of the horizon. Adad thunders within it . . . The raging of Adad reached unto heaven, turned into darkness all that was light . . . the land he broke like a pot."45 In a hymn to Adad, Adad rides upon the storm and the hurricane ; his glory covers the world ; his light appears afar, and his voice is heard at a distance; the hailstones are in his hand, and he sends forth the lightning as his messenger.46 Thus the idea of riding upon the clouds (the cherubim are so identified in these passages), and of sending forth the wind and the thunderbolt as messengers, are common to the biblical theophany and the hymns to the storm-god. The darkness and the earthquake are features which are mentioned in the Sinai narratives. The theophany, then, is not a simple thunderstorm, nor yet an earth- quake nor a volcanic eruption, but a manifestation of Yahweh in a con- vulsion of nature. As a literary device, it is an expression of the Hebrew idea of the divine power in nature. The power there manifested is not blind; the theophany is an appearance of the divine wrath, especially of the wrath of Yahweh against the enemies of Israel. This idea is, of its very nature, primitive ; it is difficult to see how Duhm could have treated it as a late literary conceit.47 In theophanies where Yahweh does not appear in His wrath, one may suspect that the theophany is composed 40 Tablet XI 97-98, 105-107; Heidel, The Gilgamesh Epic And Old Testament Parallels, Chicago, 1945, 84-85 ; Speiser in Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts. 94. 46 Rogers, Cuneiform Parallels To The Old Testament , N.

Artur Weiser ("Theophanie in den Psalmen und im Festkult," Festschrift für Alfred Bertholet, Tübingen, 1950) agrees with this criticism of Duhm, and agrees also that the Sinai theophany is the pattern of the Psalm theophanies. But he would find the explanation of the theophany in the Gattung of the Psalms; and he sees in them a cultic representation of the Sinai theophany, which was a part of the annual covenant celebration at the anniversary of the monarch's accession. I do not believe this theory can be discussed here; nor do I see that it should alter our consideration of the theophany as an expression of the Hebrew idea of God and nature.</page><page sequence="21">38 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 14 purely for its imaginative values after the manner of earlier theophanies ; such, for instance, is the theophany of Ps. 104:2-4. But in the earliest forms of the theophany, the deity of the theophany was in a special way the God of Israel, and, in particular, the helper of Israel. It is difficult to find any reason for this except the theophany of Sinai, which associated Yahweh once and for all with the phenomena of this solemn occasion. The Theophany of Elijah It is surprising, therefore, to find one theophany in which it is denied that Yahweh is in the storm (1 Kgs. 19:11-13) : There was Yahweh passing by; and there was a great and mighty wind which rent the mountain and shattered the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind. And after the wind came an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake came lightning; but Yahweh was not in the lightning. After the lightning, there was the sound of a gentle whisper. Now when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then a voice came to him. When we recall the traditional concept of Yahweh in the theophany, the denial that Yahweh is in the storm or the earthquake here appears alto- gether deliberate. But what is the meaning of the denial?48 It may be parabolic: the overthrow of the Baal cult is not to be accomplished by violent means, or by a great display of power. For the Baal also was a nature-deity ; and Yahweh would not be distinguishable from the Baal by a mere display of power in nature. Such a display is narrated in 1 Kgs. 18; in the competition between Elijah and the prophets of the Baal on Mount Carmel, "it is Yahweh who sends the lightning to consume the victim. Our narrator represents this display as failing to accomplish its purpose. This, we say, may be the meaning of the passage ; but one feels the danger that it reads too much into the text. But the passage certainly does not mean that Yahweh is not present in such phenomena ; such a denial would run counter to the whole traditional conception of Yahweh, and would be out of accord with the context of the passage. For the contest between Yahweh and the Baal was waged precisely on the ground of dominion over the forces of nature. When Elijah demands that the people choose between Yahweh and the Baal, he means that there can be only one lord of nature ; it is proper to divinity to possess this prerogative. If Yahweh is elohim (which no Hebrew would deny), then there is no room for a Baal who 46 A summary and discussion of the exegetical opinions on this passage is found in Tobac-Coppens, Les prophètes ď Israel, Malines, 1932, 158-160. Coppens' conclusion is simple despair : "À notre avis, nous ne possédons pas encore d'exégèse satisfaisante de la scène d'Horeb."</page><page sequence="22">God and Nature in the Old Testament 39 has the power of granting fertilty. Hence it appears more probable that the denial that Yahweh is in the wind or the earthquake is a denial that He is identified with these forces as a nature-deity. Baal, or any nature- deity, was not a truly cosmic deity. Yahweh, on the contrary, was the lord of all the forces of nature, but in none, in the sense that no particular force was His proper domain. He is equally powerful and active when there is no such display of powers ; and His will is accomplished by hidden means, as well as by the spectacular. The theophany of Elijah is a refinement upon the theophany of Sinai. (To be concluded in the Aprii issue) John L. McKenzie, S.J. West Baden College West Baden Springs, Indiana</page></plain_text>
