<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION/CREATION DEBATE In dealing in the classroom or in the legisla- ture with creationism as related to evolution, one may first ask: What is the relevance of scripture to modern science? In order to an- swer that question, one must also ask: How outdated is a treatment that does not rely on either microscopes or a recognition of the mo- lecular design of matter? There is a small, but vocal, number of Ph.D.'s who want the biblical explanation in- serted into scientific contexts. We should not allow their sounds to drown out the fact that the vast majority of scientists are aware that the still-evolving scientific explanation has al- ready replaced the ancient narrative (cf. Rich- ard David Wilhelm, Ph.D. dissertation, Uni- versity of Texas at Austin, 1978), and that the two answers are independent of each other. SIDNEY W. FOX Institute for Molecular and Cellular Evolution 521 Anastasia University of Miami Coral Gables, FL 33134 Recent exchanges among scientists con- cerning the question of animal rights reveal a relatively consistent schizoid logic in those who support man's unconditional dominion over nonhuman animals. On the one hand, there is widespread acceptance of the Darwin- ian theory of evolution (or neo-Darwinian ver- sions thereof) insofar as agreeing that Homo sapiens has biological kinship with other life forms (most obviously with the primates), rather than being a wholly separate, special form of creation. On the other hand, psycho- logical kinship, a correlate of biological affini- Continued on p. 376 374 BioScience Vol. 30 No. 6</page><page sequence="2">LETTERS ... from p. 374 ty, is discounted, particularly in the realm of sentience (the capacity to suffer). Discounting any psychological affinity con- veniently reduces or eliminates the burden of being morally obligated to respect the in- trinsic worth and basic rights of nonhuman animals: If one believes that animals possess no significant psychological similarities to man, then it does seem logical to conclude that they are less sentient. Any biological sim- ilarities can also be discounted as examples of evolutionary convergence or coincident paral- lelism. This kind of thinking is quite contrary to the Darwinian theory of evolution (which is neither anthropomorphic nor zoocentric) and echoes the creationists' view of man as a spe- cial form of creation, separate from and hav- ing no real biological and psychological kin- ship with the rest of the biotic community. Cartesianism and the instrumental rational- ist interpretation of dominion (from Genesis) as domination rather than stewardship are value systems that support the creationists' posture. Would it be fair to say that, at this stage of ethical awareness, particularly in re- lation to animals, we are still at a wholly hu- manocentric, pre-Copernican stage? Or per- haps such ethical awareness is still at the "flat-earth" phase of conceptualization. Scientists merely give lip-service to the Darwinian theory of evolution when they ac- This Publication.... .a.m .S ml IIM is Available in MICROFORM For Complete Information WRITE : WRITE: University Microfilms International Dept.

Physiologists and pathologists use animals as structuro-functional models for understanding human physiology and disease; similarly, experimental psychologists use ani- mals as psychological models for mental proc- esses and emotional problems in man. If the research of experimental psychologists who use animal models is of high fidelity, then we must assume that certain animal species do, in fact, have a very close psychological affinity to Homo sapiens. This then raises very pro- found ethical questions over the use of ani- mals in various psychological experiments, especially those involving emotional stress, aversive conditioning, maternal deprivation, social isolation, and learned helplessness. If, on the other hand, such ethical concerns are considered unwarranted and anthropo- morphic, then such studies by experimental psychologists are surely of no relevance to understanding the etiology and treatment of human emotional disorders. Can experimen- tal psychologists defend their position by proving that the subjective state of the animal and its suffering is in no way analogous to the subjective suffering of a person under condi- tions modeled in the animal experiment? If it is contended that the fidelity of the model is only at the level of mechanism and process and does not impinge upon the ani- mal's subjective state of suffering or psycho- logical well-being, then surely we have a seri- ous conceptual error at the very heart of experimental psychology. Similar criticisms may be raised in biomedical research, as when a disease or other abnormality is experi- mentally induced in animals to model some human anomaly. The model is of high fidelity if the structuro-functional changes in the ani- mal are analogous to those that occur in man. Since process, mechanism, and experience-- like body and mind-are not separate, then the question of animal suffering cannot be dismissed. Would it not therefore be fair to conclude that, in the absence of evidence to the con- trary, the closer the animal model is to a hu- man disorder, which in man can cause phys- ical or psychological suffering, then the greater the probability will be that the animal will suffer in some degree comparable, but not necessarily identical, to man? How do those who might reject such a probability integrate evolutionary theory into their thinking with- out avoiding paradoxical if not schizoid logic? In theory, Darwinian and neo-Darwinian con- cepts of evolution may be quite acceptable. Yet in practice, it may well be more comfort- able for instrumental rationalists to adhere to the creationists' hubris of seeing mankind as a special form of divine creation. As such, man is superior and therefore free to exploit "lower" life forms as a means to satisfy hu- man ends. In contrast, if we accept evolution- ary theory, we must acknowledge that ani- r. als have their own intrinsic worth and interests or ends in and for themselves. If the latter argument is unacceptable, then evolutionary theory must be rejected in favor of the creationists' view. If it is acceptable, then we should radically revise current atti- tudes and practices in the use of sentient ani- mals in biomedical, psychological, and other fields of research. MICHAEL W.
