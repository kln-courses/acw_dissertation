SEBEOK, Indiana University Generations of linguists, as well as other scientific observers of language, have followed with fascination the exquisitely fashioned series of studies of bee colonies and, in particular, the detailed accounts of the dances which foraging honey bees perform on their return to the hive and which serve to inform their nest mates of the presence of food, its direction, distance, and quality, reported by K. von Frisch. Based on the pioneer efforts of Rosch during the 1920's,l the researches of von Frisch and of his fellow-investigators will surely abide as one of the most impressive achievements of contemporary science. To be fully savored -for their thoroughness, rigor, and elegance and, indeed, for sheer exhilaration- one should follow his verba ipsissima, perhaps most readily available in a collec- tion of three lectures delivered in the course of a tour of the United States early in 1949.2 From the point of vantage of human communication, the story of the dancing bees has sometimes been treated as a kind of scientific parable, a primitive be- havior pattern from which various Aesopian lessons may be drawn. Thus one of the most eminent psychologists of language, Buihler, citing an early monograph by von Frisch,3 argued-metaphorically anticipating a cybernetic model-that no animal community can exist without a steering mechanism guiding the social relations of the community members, and that this entails an interchange of signs as much as an interchange of matter: 'Und diese Steuerungsmittel die wir exact beobachten konnen, sind das vormenschliche Analogon zur Sprache.' A systematic interchange of matter among the members of an animal community is, in fact, inconceivable to Buiihler without an accompanying interchange of signs, which leads him to conclude, 'soweit muss eine biologisch wohlfundierte Sprachtheorie ausholen und dann noch eine letzte Horizonterweiterung vornehmen.'4 1 G.

His particular concern was to illuminate the distinction between signs and symbols as to both their mechanism and their function. 'I have discussed the facts with several linguists,' he wrote, but we 'seemed to take the attitude that the bees' informations must be mere signs or signals,' and 'scarcely tried to analyze away the symbolic nature of these informa- tions.' He therefore undertook to examine the matter more closely. While, in so doing, he shed light on several facets of language, he failed to resolve to his own satisfaction his initial query, whether the communicative techniques used by the bees are 'genuinely or pseudo-symbolic'--possibly because the nature of the opposition between his key concepts, 'sign' and 'symbol', is itself by no means unclouded.6 At least four linguists have pondered Apis mellifera as a source of insights about Homno sapiens. Laziczius, in an attempt to elucidate the three constitutive factors of verbal communication which were so fashionable in his day-the emotive, the conative, and the referential-described the last as the 'most human' of all: the bee, he explained, can be the source of a message and its destination, but the message does not denote, i.e. has no cognitive function. If one were to transmute such messages into human speech, they would be interjections: from the ad- dresser's standpoint they generate tension, and from the addressee's they are imperatives spurring to circumscribed action.7 It must be remembered that these remarks of Laziczius were, like Buhler's, based on von Frisch's early work; but while the formal properties of this communication system had been accurately observed and meticulously described even then, it took two more decades to crack the code. Lotz has pointed out how instructive it may be 'to those linguists who exclude the study of meaning from linguistics proper' to follow the unfolding of this story: 'After his first hypothesis was refuted, that of a two-word code, with the round dance standing for pollen and the wiggling dance for the nectar, the dance was interpreted as a symptom of general excitement, without further meaning. In 1946, however, von Frisch himself was able to prove that the dance represented a method of conveying very explicit information.'8 Lotz was also the first linguist to make a structural analysis of bee communi- cation, with a view to providing a basis for systematic comparison with the structure of language.

Zoology and psychology have converged and a special discipline called ethology has matured which comprehends, in the narrow sense, the comparative anatomy of gesture of animal species or, more broadly, the scientific study of animal behavior.12 Important advances were being 10 E.

The widely accepted belief that the bee's field of semantic reference is rigidly re- stricted to information about the location of food and its quality was then shattered by Lindauer's discovery that an almost identical code is used in indi- cating possible sites for a future hive.15 Literally following in his teacher's footsteps, Lindauer toured North America ten years after von Frisch. In the spring of 1959 he delivered the Prather Lectures in Biology at Harvard University, and his delightful Communication among social bees is based on them. The book brings together pertinent facts uncovered since von Frisch was in our midst, and focuses upon four specific problem areas: Are there simple, elementary (i.e. phylogenetically older) forms of communication in Apis mellifera which might turn out to be components of the dance? Does the dance occur in related species and genera and, if so, in what forms and with what significance? Does the dance reveal previously unsuspected ranges of meaning? And finally, what is the physiology of the sensory mechanisms through which information is transferred? The opening sentence of Lindauer's text reads: 'In the last analysis, all animals are social beings.' The chief implication of this assertion is that all organic alliances presuppose a measure of communication: Protozoa interchange signals;16 an aggregate of cells becomes an organism by virtue of the fact that the com- ponent cells can influence one another. Metazoa assemble in various kinds of alliances. Minimally, they must come together to form a temporary tandem for mating, thus enabling their species to continue. When the sexual partners remain together until the offspring appear, we may speak of a family community, that is, a group whose members STAY together but become differentiated-a type of process realized in most dramatic fashion by insect colonies. On the other hand, members of a species not necessarily stemming from one mother may COME together and become integrated into 'interest communities', joined together, for instance, for mutual protection-like a school of dolphins.'7 In all such unions- whether transient or persistent, closed or open, divergent or convergent, simple or complex-creatures of the same species must locate and identify each other; 13 N.

Since 'any form of energy propagation can be exploited for communication purposes',20 and many forms are in fact at the disposal of animals, one of his first tasks is to specify the sense or constellation of senses employed in the message-processing situations which he is observing. When describing speech phenomena, many linguists, at the crossroads of conflicting approaches, continue to employ a mixed nomen- clature, drawing for their technical vocabulary now on articulatory, now on acoustic, and sometimes on perceptual phonetics; the resulting montage may show seams, but the total picture makes sense. The zoologist, attempting to identify communication in a given group of animals, may likewise define the event by the manner in which the signal is encoded, passed on, or decoded; how- ever, the classification chosen leads one into quite different realms of discourse, which appear far from being blended into a harmonious synthesis. Sometimes the action of an effector organ is featured, for instance in the description of the signalling system of fireflies, of which the chemistry has been worked out in considerable detail.2' At other times, properties of the intervening medium are emphasized, for instance in studies of the sonic (and ultrasonic) emissions of the bottlenose dolphin, where excellent spectrographic representations of signals- plus-noise have not yet been supplemented by a definitive description of the underlying mechanism to explain the results, let alone of the 'meanings' of the recorded exchanges.22 More often than not, the spotlight falls upon the action of a receptor organ, as the dog's sense of smell.23 A signal encoded by one means, say chemical, may be variously interpreted, say by the olfactory sense or the gusta- tory sense. On the other hand, signals of quite varied origin-produced, say by 18 These phenomena are discussed in regard to the dragonfly, and generally, in A.

A classification at the receptor stage seems to yield, on the whole, a much simpler and more heuristically useful framework, as illustrated, for example, by Marler's comprehensive survey.24 'The most primitive communication undoubtedly takes place by chemical means,' Lindauer tells us (2), yet the chemical senses play an important role in the life of most animals, with the probable exception of birds. Lindauer considers chemical communication 'primitive' because the possibilities for modulation are highly restricted. It is true that the stag, for example, can broadcast two different scent signals: one, by marking the trail, to keep the herd together; the other, by delimiting the boundaries of his territory, to warn off rival males. But to accom- plish the emission of two kinds of information he must use two anatomically separated organs, the hoof glands and the eye glands. As almost anyone who has run over a polecat on a highway knows, a shocking message (ethanethiol) is abruptly produced but cannot be so rapidly turned off. In this very lack of flexibility, however, lies the one distinct advantage of chemical signals: by these means, an individual is capable of communicating with another in the future and, what is even more remarkable, an individual is also capable, by virtue of delayed feedback, of communicating with himself in the future.25 A spectacular illustra- tion of the persistence in time of chemical signals is the retention by a salmon of odor impressions from youth to maturity (i.e. over three to five years), enabling its return from the sea to its precise parent stream.26 Canine predators, among other mammals (bears, bisons, etc.), put urine very much to the same uses that we put another chemical, ink-a substance which, Uldall once justly complained, 'has not received the same attention on the part of linguists that they have so lavishly bestowed on the substance of air'.27 Yet the graphic manifestation of language, script, no less than speech, has its functional analog elsewhere in the animal kingdom, and in particular throughout the mammalian orders. The transmission of food-and, along with the nourishment, information vital to the colony-constitutes another elementary form of communication among bees. The social significance of the food exchange (trophallaxis) is threefold. First, the quality of the fare imparts information to the foragers about the extent of the competition to which their territory is subject (only the best food sources release the alerting dance). Second, the water demand for temperature regula- tion is reported and finely attuned by this means, the extent of the need being 24 P.

Third, since the food contains minute portions of a substance picked up by licking the queen's body, all bees in a hive are kept constantly aware of her presence or absence and react to her removal, in a matter of hours, by preparations to replace her. Having briefly disposed of food as a symbol conductor, Lindauer devotes all of the remaining four of his five chapters to communication by dancing. The olfactory sense, the sense of taste, the eye, the gravitational sense organs, and the time sense are all discussed, but he pays no attention in this book, even in passing, to the much disputed question whether honey bees can perceive sound waves and, if so, whether information is transmitted by this means from one bee to another. For a consideration of the acoustic behavior of bees, one must turn to other sources, for instance Haskell's handbook.28 Suggestions that foraging bees use sound in communicating distance of a food source to other workers in the hive deserve particularly careful evaluation in the light of Lindauer's own stricture that 'unsolved questions still remain concerning the sensory per- formances for distance indication' (111), and evidence which is now available showing that sound, at least in the range of 600 to 2,000 cps., is in fact used by bees for information exchange.29 Assuming the uses of the round dance, the global near-deixis, and of the tail- wagging dance, the calibrated far-deixis,30 in the search for food to be widely known, Lindauer describes them, at the outset of his second chapter, only in summary fashion. In this context, one misses a report of the highly interesting experiment which was carried out by W. Steche years before the current excite- ment about the feasibility of interspecies communication, namely, between man and dolphin; he in fact demonstrated man's ability to communicate as a honey 28 P. R. Haskell, Insect sounds (Chicago, 1961). Lindauer did prove, however, that humming in the stingless bee, Meliponini, has 'something to do' with the collector's alerting other hive bees (76). 29 A. M. Wenner, 'Communication with queen honey bees by substrate sound', Science 138.446-7 (1962). The nature of the bee's sound receptor is unknown, but to elicit a series of 'quacks', the vibrations had to be transmitted directly through the hive material, i.e. when the generator's sound was sent through the air, the bee did not respond. A few months after I had finished this review, I had an opportunity to visit the laboratory of H. Esch, at the University of Munich, and to observe a series of new discoveries about bee communication. Very briefly, these appear to be as follows. The tail-wagging dance carries no information unless accompanied by a whirring sound, i.e. it is a redundant gesture com- monly known as an intention movement. The duration of the sound informs the worker bees about the distance of the nectar supply; thus a whir of 0.4 seconds indicates 200 meters, of 8 seconds 10,000 meters and so forth. The higher the quality of the food-find, the more vehe- ment the dancer's whir-whereby quality and distance are additionally coupled in an economic relationship. The sound is not a monologue, for the scout's drumming is fol- lowed by short, chirping beeps emitted by the watching workers, seemingly mean- ing: 'message understood'. When the scout senses the beep she stops dancing, thus enabling a worker to approach her and smell the odor of the nectar she has found. If she fails to stop, she is stung to death. Popular reports of dramatic experiments have appeared in Time (May 31, 1963), and the German magazine Der Spiegel (June 19, 1963). Cf. H. Esch, 'Uber die Schallerzeugung beim Werbetanz der Honigbiene', Z. vergleich.

Steche equipped a working hive with a faintly perfumed artificial bee whose oscillations on the comb surface he could control remotely by electronic links; manipulating his wooden bee with levers, he succeeded in programming the live bees that crowded around the imitation insect to head in a prescribed direction to seek and find nectar.31 Unlike a bird's nest, which is simply an incubator turned into a cradle, a bee- hive serves not only as a nursery but also as the colony's meeting place, social center-in a word, home. It is therefore hardly surprising that the search for a dwelling of high quality looms as a problem for a bee community next only to the search for food. Yet it became known only within the past decade that the dances of the bees play a decisive role in conveying information about shelter; in the rest of Chapter 2, Lindauer spells out the ways in which this is accomplished. He traces how the scout bees announce the location of suitable nesting places by means of the dance in the cluster; how, before moving, the swarm 'agrees' upon one of the nesting places offered; how this 'agreement' comes about; how the quality of a nesting place is evaluated; and which bees function as house hunters. The pragmatic import of the tail-wagging dance, we learn, depends not upon variation in the formal expression but rather upon the attendant physical con- text of the same gesture pattern. Hockett has already pointed this out,32 but his observation needs one qualification: although the form of the dance is identical, there are significant differences in duration. The message, being a call of con- cern to the entire swarm, often lasts more than five minutes and may continue for an hour. Lindauer relates the history of one suspenseful 'debate' which lasted for five days, and the exceptional case of one aerial tug of war which ended, after a fortnight's dancing, without an agreement. The biological function of duration, under normal circumstances, is obvious: the longer the dance, the more bees can visit the chosen site and thereupon act as guides for the swarm. In the lifetime of a worker, a house-hunt is a very rare, perhaps unique, event, whereas there are many opportunities to communicate about sources of crops to be ex- ploited for food. 'Is a structural dialectology possible?' we may ask with Weinreich,33 extending his question to the domain of animal communication. A survey of recent de- velopments in the experimental study of bird songs, at least, leaves no room for doubt that the answer will be affirmative: 'it is well known that in many cases the song of the species can be sufficiently constant and distinct to serve as a specific recognition mark, but yet can vary within these limits sufficiently to indicate subspecific, racial and local populations.'34 From a wealth of data, one might cite the chaffinch, where the effects of geographic boundaries have been shown to result in 'true' dialect formation (i.e. in local variations which are not based on genetic discontinuities). The dialect areas may range in size from an isolated glen in Scotland to a mosaic of very small pieces, delimited by a road or 31 'How to talk to a bee', Time, 9 Feb. 1959, p. 34.

Sick, in the Stuttgart region;35 and may exhibit differences both in inventory and in distribution. Synchronic dialectology, Wein- reich defines, 'compares systems that are partially different and analyzes the "synchronic consequences" of these differences within the similarities.' This was the procedure followed in a series of engrossing experiments with wild crows. Crows in this country are known to exhibit distinctive alarm notes inducing other crows to disperse, distress calls when caught, and assembly calls emitted when they sight a bird of prey or a cat. These calls were tape-recorded and, when played to wild crows in an American woodland, elicited much the same reactions. When, however, these tape recordings were tested on crows in France, either there was no response or the French crows assembled where the Americans would have fled. Captive Pennsylvania crows respond 'abnormally' to the calls of Maine crows and vice versa; but crows free to migrate between the two regions construct a dia- system which enables them to understand both local dialects.36 Since the appearance of the book under review, the topic of the third chapter has received special attention from von Frisch himself.37 Both treatments deal with what we might designate, still using Weinreich's terminology, diachronic dialectology, namely the phenomenon of divergence: 'it studies the growth of partial differences at the expense of similarities and possibly reconstructs earlier stages of greater similarity.' Observations carried out on six races-Italian, Austrian, German, Punic, Caucasian, and Egyptian-within the species Apis melltifera soon showed communicative variations in respect both to the area indicated, respectively by a round and a tail-wagging dance, and to the dancing rhythm. Thus if the distance between the hive and the food source is 100 meters, the number of complete revolutions of the figure-eight-shaped dance per 15 seconds for each race was calculated, respectively, as 7.95, 8.4, 9, 9.05, 9.8 and 9.25. Given such minute geographic variations, one cannot help wondering whether bees would misunderstand each other if different races were placed to- gether to make a mixed colony. Being members of the same species, an Austrian bee (A. mellifera carnica) and an Italian bee (A. mellifera ligustica) can inter- breed; if put together in a colony, they work together in harmony; and the dance of one will arouse the other-yet they experience confusion whenever they at- tempt to communicate: 'If, for example, an Austrian bee receives information from an Italian bee about a food place 100 meters from the nest, she will fly 120 meters, because she interprets the "Italian dialect" in her Austrian way. And conversely, the Italian bee will fly only 80 meters when given information for 100 meters by an Austrian bee' (61). The experiment reported by Lindauer is remi- niscent of the 'test the informant' method designed to measure the degree to which members of one speech community can understand the utterances of members of another,38 but a linguist is bound to envy the precision with which his apiarian colleague is able to record and represent the extent of variation. 3'sUber die Dialektbildung beim "Regenruf" des Buchfinken', J. orn. 87.568-92 (1939). 86 H.

It has now been shown that phylogenetic research is equally feasible, among the bee's taxonomic relatives, in respect to the dance complex-a sophisticated behavior pattern which also leaves no paleontological record, as fossils of, say, termite nests, by way of petrified proof. In trying to track the dancing instinct backwards in time, one must start with descriptive statements of existing structures of communication in species of Apis other than mellifera. To accomplish this, Lindauer journeyed to the original home of our honey bee, the Indo-Malayan region, which is the habitat of all other known species of this genus: A. indica, the giant A. dorsata, and the dwarf A. florea. In brief what he found was this. All four species use essentially the same method of communication-by round dances and tail-wagging dances-as far as food pro- vision and search for housing sites are concerned. With respect to the indication of distance (which is expressed in the rhythm of the tail-wagging dance), only minor differences appeared, although these were more pronounced than those among the strains within the species. With respect to the indication of direction, however, Lindauer did make one crucial discovery, namely, that the dwarf bee is incapable of transposing light to gravity. That is to say, members of this species can dance only on a horizontal surface. Von Frisch characterizes theirs as 'a clearly more primitive social organization and a correspondingly less highly de- veloped language' (83). To regress still further on the evolutionary scale, Lindauer and his associates turned to the bees most closely related to the Apini, the stingless bees of the sub- family Meliponini. All eleven species so far investigated were found to 'have a means of communication that enables them to alert other bees and to guide them to a specific goal' (72), but their technique differs in many points from that of their relatives. The essential difference lies in the fact that Meliponini newcomers are not directed to their goal by information imparted exclusively in the hive (direction and distance information are not even incorporated in their alerting system), but are also guided by trail marks and pilot bees beyond the hive. Although their solution may seem less elegant to us, it is just as successful as the honey bee's and, in at least one respect, superior: Communication fails when honey bees are required to report a feeding place much above or below the hive,39 but not so in the stingless bees. As the linguist cautiously probes from constructs such as linguistic families toward wider historical reconstructions which some call, 'by an unfortunate biological metaphor,' phyla and macro-phyla,40 so the ethologist searches out 39 K. von Frisch, H.

It may be interesting to recall, in passing, that Darwin himself, on the other hand, used 'language' as a key metaphor: 'a breed, like a dialect of a language'; 'It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking the case of languages'; 'Rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word'; etc. Cf.

As far as the social insects are concerned, one must single out what is undoubtedly the most complex chemical communication system yet described: E. 0. Wilson's brilliant work with fire ants (Solenopsis saevissima).41 In the course of his investigations, Wilson measured the information transmitted in the odor trails of the fire ants and then compared the results with the information content of the honeybee's waggle dance. It turned out that the two message-types transmit similar quanti- ties of information, to wit, 3 to 5 bits for direction and 2 for distance. In other words, each species, with radically differing systems, manages to employ, ac- curately, an 8- to 32-point compass and 4-interval scale, as may be summarized in Fig. 2.42 A combination of alerting and indicating of direction are traits shared among the ants and the stingless bees. As a concluding reference in this context should be recorded the curious dancing behavior of the fly Phormia regina. A series of extremely interesting observations by V. G. Dethier43 gives a plausible hint that here physiology has located one of the essential roots of the elaborate bee dance. Sensory aspects in the determination of distance and of directional information are treated in Lindauer's fourth chapter, while in the last he takes up certain special problems concerning solar orientation (including reports about the be- havior of bees raised by artificial illumination, and the solar compass in com- petition with terrestrial landmarks). Before leaving the bees for the dolphins, I should like to make two digressive observations, the first of them stimulated by J. H. Greenberg. In reviewing Hockett's chapter on 'Man's place in nature', and, in particular, in connection with Hockett's treatment of bee communication, Greenberg, 'as a human', insists that he 'would like to win out over the bees by more than a technical knock- out'.44 He appears to mean that there is a single structural trait which distin- guishes their system of communication from ours: 'All human languages includ- ing written and other representations which permit one-to-one conversion on the sentence level are universal metalanguages and only human language has this property.' If exchanged cues and propositions about codification and relation- ship between the communicators is 'metacommunication',45 then clear instances of such higher-order social interchanges can be found among many animals. The metacommunicative messages used by rhesus monkeys, enabling them to dis- tinguish between play and nonplay, have received particularly careful attention,46 and a form of instinctive behavior in the honeybee has been recorded which 41 'Chemical communication among workers of the fire ant', Animal behaviour 10.134-64 (1962). 42 Reproduced, with the author's permission, and that of the editors of Animal behaviour, from Fig. 5, loc.cit. 154. 43 'Communication by insects: Physiology of dancing', Science 125.331-6 (1957). 44 Am. anthrop. 63.1140-5 (1961), esp. the last paragraph on p. 1144. 46 Cf.

When a worker leaves the hive for field duties, she carries a sample of her particular colony odor (which, as a result of the actual flow of wax, pollen, and nectar, presents a certain uniformity throughout the hive) locked in a special scent sac. Upon her return, immediately before landing, she opens her scent gland as though displaying a pass badge to the guard bees. The odor of a strange worker causes bellicose behavior, but bees with the match- ing home odor are admitted.47 When individual b5, of the colony C, sends a signal s, to individuals bn of C, this event can be represented by a simple formula: b-&gt; sx -n 47 F.

As far as the bees are concerned, it is clear that their behavior resembles that of an analog computer (as has already been noted by both a zoologist and another linguist49), that is, a control machine of the more-or-less type, and not at all of a digital computer, of a yes- or-no type. Lindauer's book, supplemented by reports of other findings published else- where, makes it possible now to adjust and expand somewhat the column on bee dancing in Hockett's latest table (1960) of 13 design features. In that version, he had marked five slots positively: (2) broadcast, (4) interchangeability, (7) se- manticity, (10) displacement, and (11) productivity. A 'yes' should also be entered in row (5) for total feedback-since any dancer will cease to emit messages in the absence of an 'audience'; and in row (8) for arbitrariness-since the gesture can, after all, be decomposed into elements used to transmit specific portions of information. In addition, one should remember that the field of semantic reference comprehends both food source and nesting site. In feature (1), Hockett combined the transmitter, the channel, and the receiver into one single category, 'vocal- auditory'; but it would be much better to keep the three stages strictly apart: the auditory component in the total ribbon of bee communication, for example, invites separate inquiry. Further important features include a transcoding po- tential,50 that is, an ability to convert directional vectors from a visual field (positive phototaxis) to a gravitational field (negative geotaxis); and finally, the capacity for a restricted form of metacommunication. Aristotle was the first natural historian who alluded to the dancing bees: 'on reaching the hive they throw off their load [aposeiontai 'they shake themselves'], and each bee on his return is accompanied by three or four companions.' Aristotle was also the first marine biologist who accurately classed the dolphin with the mammals, adding: 'The dolphin, when taken out of the water, gives a squeak and moans in the air ... For this creature has a voice [and can therefore utter vocal or vowel sounds], for it is furnished with a lung and a windpipe; but its tongue is not loose, nor has it lips, so as to give utterance to an articulate sound [or a sound of vowel and consonant in combination] .5 48 T.

Szilard's clever satirical piece on the voice of the dolphins53). The reports of Kellogg and of Lilly could thus be viewed as climaxing centuries of accumulated observations. On the other hand, they could also, and perhaps more aptly, be regarded as major if tentative opening moves in a new scientific game: marine bioacoustics. The existence of animal communication by sound (underwater creatures com- municate by other means too, of course: electric fish distort their own high- voltage fields; one member of the squid family squirts a radiant cloud to hide behind) in the 'silent world' of the ocean depths came to the serious attention of the scientific community only within the last quarter of a century. 'Roars, knocks, honks, squeals, "popping of corks"-old sounds from new places' are now under intense investigation in their natural environment by means of a hydrophone system;54 and the literature of the field has already reached stagger- ing proportions.55 The whistles, squeals, chirps, clicks, rasps, and other noises of marine mammals have suggested three areas of inquiry: orientation by echolocation, intraspecies communication, and interspecies communication. Kellogg's research program is devoted largely to the way in which porpoises navigate, and his book presents impressive evidence showing the workings of their sonar system-how they avoid obstacles while swimming at night or in turbid water, and how they locate fish for food. The author is a psychologist noted for his flair in conducting imagina- tive experiments with large-brained mammals: thirty years ago, he and Mrs. Kellogg adopted a seven-month-old chimpanzee into their home, and compared her with their baby son.56 In the present instance, his work carries on a tradition embodied in D. R. Griffin's masterpiece on acoustic orientation in bats, in certain nocturnal birds, and among blind men.57 In pleasant contrast with Lilly's per- 52 Op.cit.

Although acoustical studies of captive cetaceans have concentrated for the most part on the bottlenose dolphin, the sonic activities of the pilot whale, the spotted porpoise, the harbor porpoise, the Atlantic saddleback dolphin, the white-sided porpoise, and, lately, the white whale have also been recorded.

Kellogg's first chapter positions the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, in common usage also called a porpoise, in the taxonomic order of Cetacea, among the toothed whales or Odontoceti, and concludes with the description of a dramatic incident, foreshadowing the particularized substance of the rest of his book, in the course of which, by a lucky concatenation of circumstances, he successfully recorded the underwater noises made by a school of some twenty wild dolphins in their natural state. ('Never before that time-and never since-have we been fortunate enough to capture such an auditory event on magnetic recording tape' [10]. That is to say, virtually all observations, by all researchers in this field, relate to captive and often solitary animals.) The second chapter deals primarily with the dolphin's order of intelligence, meaning its ability to learn from experience. According to Kellogg, an accurate assessment 'is not yet possible because of the dearth of experimental research on the subject' (25); although Lilly predicts, from an elaborate argument based chiefly on anatomical considerations, that Tursiops will prove to be as intelligent as man (Appendix Two, 255-94). The dolphin appears to differ from other mammals in one striking respect, namely, the extent to which its vocalization can be modified. In seeming contradiction to the assertions of B. F. Skinner, that 'Well-defined emotional and other innate responses comprise reflex systems which are difficult, if not impossible, to modify by operant reinforcement', and that 'Vocal behavior below the human level is especially refractory',58 dolphins can readily be trained to vocalize for a reward. Lilly goes much further and claims to have unique evidence for some degree of mimicking of human laughter, human or electronically produced whistles, 'Bronx cheers' and similar noises, and ('These are the most subjective of all the judgments of the sounds emitted by dolphins') words (201-2). However this may be, the zoologist R. J. Andrew has reviewed the implications of these and other discussions of the acquisition of high intelli- gence and the ability of vocal mimicking in the broad perspective of human evolution, and has come to certain pertinent conclusions: that the intelligence of a dolphin is of an order somewhere between that of a dog and that of a chimpanzee; that, in view of our vast ignorance of the causes of the evolution of the capability for sound mimicry in birds or man, 'it would be foolish to assume that the ce- taceans cannot mimic', but that such behavior is bound to be adaptive-involv- ing, as we might say, a set of messages serving to establish, prolong, or dis- continue contact, to check whether the network is in operating condition, or, to use B. Malinowski's terse phrase, phatic communion.59 One residual fact, with 58 Verbal behavior 463 (New York, 1957). That vocal behavior can be brought under stimu- lus control in birds has been demonstrated by J. H. Grosslight, P. C. Harrison, and C. M. Weiser, in two studies reported in their 'Reinforcement control of vocal responses in the mynah bird (Gracula religiosa)', The psych. record 12.193-201 (1962). S. M. Sapon has 'suc- ceeded in conditioning vocal responses in a normally silent animal-the white laboratory rat ... These sounds function as operants by which a hungry or thirsty animal may acquire food and/or water' (personal communication, 10 Dec. 1962). 69 R. J.

Eiseley, in rhapsodic reaction to Lilly's work, 'The long loneliness-man and the 462</page><page sequence="16">REVIEWS interesting if disturbing implications for the evolution of speech, is the evident ease with which dolphins can be trained to vocalize in order to obtain rewarding stimulation, and how markedly this contrasts with findings in primates60 for which visual messages are, by and large, much more important.61 As Andrews states thle point: 'if a primate is trying to solve a problem it does not vocalize (unless it is giving up and going into a tantrum). If it is made to vocalize, then its attention is no longer on the problem, or on the reward that awaits its solution; that it will learn to use vocalization to obtain a reward is therefore most un- likely.' The dolphin, however, with its wide repertoire of sounds, vocalizes fre- quently and under various circumstances. In his third chapter, Kellogg surveys the kinds of sounds encountered in the ocean: of crabs and shrimp, of fishes. He explains the significance of such noises and stresses their importance for man at peace (fishing) and at war. He shows how the propagation of sound in water differs from that in air. In the next chapter, he introduces the reader to the principle of so(und) n(avigation) a(nd) r(anging), and inquires whether water noises emitted by whales are suitable for use as echo-ranging signals. In the case of the dolphin, there is an obvious similarity with man's electronic sonar, but there are two major differences: the frequency of emission of the dolphin's pinging sound varies over a wide range, whereas that of human sonar is usually constant; and the intensity of the animal noises may also be markedly altered within a single burst of ranging signals (52). The nature of the signal itself forms the topic of the fifth chapter. The echoes which bounce porpoise: Two solitary destinies', The American scholar 30.57-64 (1960-61), advances the notion that the dolphin's echo-ranging 'instrument' is a finger surrogate, and he depicts (63) 'another kind of lonely, almost disembodied intelligence floating in the wavering green fairyland of the sea-an intelligence possibly near or comparable to our own but without hands to build, to transmit knowledge by writing, or to alter by one hairsbreadth the planet's surface.' 60 E.g. C. Hayes, The ape in our house (New York, 1951). 61 Among baboons, 'most communication between troop members is gestural and without vocal accompaniment', as reported by S. L. Washburn and I. DeVore, 'Social behavior of baboons and early men', in S. L. Washburn, ed. Social life of early man 101-2 (New York, 1961). Gorillas are said by G. B. Schaller, The mountain gorilla 272 (Chicago, 1963) to 'co- ordinate the behavior within the group primarily by employing certain postures and ges- tures ... It is probable that facial expressions emphasize and elaborate information com- municated by other means ... Vocalizations notify the others of a specific emotional state of the performer, alerting them to watch for gestures which communicate further information.' Howler monkeys, on the other hand, living in dense tropical forests, frequently rely on vocalizations in situations in which a semiterrestrial primate would use a visual signal (S. A. Altmann, personal communication, 3 Dec. 1962). For a systematic study of primate displays, see R. J. Andrew, 'The origin and evolution of the calls and facial expressions of the primates', Behaviour 20.1-109 (1963). We may tentatively explain the predominance of the acoustic channel in the human (and in the dolphin)-in contradistinction to the situa- tion among the apes-in terms of an economic shift from a vegetarian to an omnivorous existence (i.e. requiring hunting); R. Ascher and C. F. Hockett suppose that 'the com- municative behavior of the great apes may be somewhat more subtle and complex than has yet been realized' in order 'to account for the apparently less highly developed vocal-audi- tory signalling of the great apes', in their unpublished paper, 'The human revolution' (1963). A popularized report of recent field studies among chimpanzees offers some hints concern- ing their 'tremendous variety of calls', but also stresses their gestures and contact move- ments; see J. Goodall, 'My life among wild chimpanzees', Nat. geog. 124.272-308 (1963), esp. the section 'Calls and gestures serve as language', 289-91. 463</page><page sequence="17">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 39, NUMBER 3 (1963) back from objects that are in the animal's way, supplying information about distance and direction, can be seen and photographed on the screen of a cathode- ray oscilloscope, and the auditory pattern can be brought within the more limited perceptual range of the human ear and brain by reducing the play-back speed of the recording tape. The question of just how the dolphin produces sound signals remains un- resolved (70): the cetaceans have no vocal cords. The dolphin's whistling, inci- dentally, can be seen-in the shape of a stream of bubbles emerging from its blowhole-as well as heard, but whether or not this message is redundant cannot be answered pending further data on its visual acuity in water. The receptor organs are much better known: accordingly, Kellogg details the dolphin's acoustic analyzer in his sixth chapter. The perception of submerged targets was studied, under controlled conditions, at the Marine Laboratories of Florida State University, as set forth in the seventh chapter. The dolphin's auditory scanning is shown to consist of the emission of a continuous series of sound signals for echolocation plus binaural localization. How the stream of information produced by auditory scanning is instantly classi- fied and associated with previously stored impulses in the animal's brain is, again, beyond present knowledge; we can but speculate about its similarity to the mechanical counterpart of such a receptor system: a sonar apparatus with one transmitter and two independent receivers, hooked up to an electronic computer capable of decoding and processing the input-all stored within a single compact unit (104-5). In addition, the dolphin's acoustic analyzer 'performs a kind of frequency analysis for every echo which is received' (123); that is, the animal can easily perceive distinctions between separate objects of the same area but of different material. The eighth and ninth chapters demonstrate the predominance, if not exclusive involvement, of the auditory sense, after elimination of the visual, olfactory (the dolphin has none), gustatory, tactual, and thermal; the experiment designed to prove that the dolphin does not simply 'follow its taste buds' (135-42) is particularly ingenious and conclusively confirms that the acoustic modality is the sole sensory avenue employed by the dolphin to discriminate a blocked passageway from an open one. Attempts to jam the echo-ranging process by broadcasting back to the dolphins tape recordings of their own sonar signals from an earlier session have failed: evidently they are able to distinguish between genuine and recorded signals (149). In his concluding chapter, Kellogg empha- sizes 'that porpoise sonar is quite a different matter from carrying on a conversa- tion' (157), because in speech the direct sound intensity is much greater than the echoes, whereas in sonar the echoes carry the relevant information and the task is to isolate one particular kind of echo from others which may be stronger or of different composition. The returning signal 'denotes'-that is, implies the ability to interpret, evaluate, and identify-features of the environment, includ- ing distance, direction, speed, size, shape, and perhaps the texture of the object delineated by the echo.

His work is imbued with what Ruskin called the 'pathetic fallacy', the rhetorical device which humanizes animals or which, applied downward, projects man into the non- human world. The author himself is well aware of this (104 ff.) but his metaphoric intllition proves stronger than his scientific discipline (303 ff.), and we find that, with due assistance from the mass media-Life magazine, the Jack Paar show- Lilly's dolphins have moved into the swim of contemporary American mythology. TLike Blake's Tiger, Lilly's Dolphin is at once something less and something more than man, a visionary creature, symbol as well as thing. With this figure in a double narrative, on the level of science and on the level of myth, he has written a strange, irritating, anecdotal, and provoking book. His obsessive concern is with the interaction of the two species named in the title; his first sentence sets the tone: 'Within the next decade or two the human species will establish com- munication with another species: nonhuman, alien, possibly extraterrestrial, more probably marine; but definitely highly intelligent, perhaps even intel- lectual' (11). This leitmotiv recurs from the first chapter, 'The possibilities of interspecies communication', through the twelfth, 'Implications'. If the passages were shaped to shock, epater, as it were, le bourgeois, they will leave sober workers in the behavioral and life sciences unmoved: not because of the freshness of the confrontation but because of the triviality of the data so far. MIoreover, Lil- ly's 'method of describing results has a high degree of subjectivity to it. It can be inexact, and even completely mistaken' (196), and the matter of mimicry thus stands, inconclusively, where Andrew left it. The following tragicomic episode, which ends chapter 11, 'The voices of the dolphin' (203), is cited in full to con- vey something of the flavor of this book. Lilly is working with a dolphin named Lizzie: Someone suggested that I would be late for dinner if I didn't leave and said, 'It's six o'clock!' very loudly. The tape recorded this on the air channel; in a few seconds on the underwater channel Lizzie, near the hydrophone, putt-putted, Baby [another dolphin] answered with a short fast series of whistles, and Lizzie very loudly came out with a 'hu- manoid' sentence, the meaning of which (if any) has puzzled several of us since. It may have been a poor copy of 'It's six o'clock.' But I was caught first by another 'meaning.' It sounded to me like 'This is a trick!' with a peculiar hissing accent. Other people have since heard the tape and come to the same conclusion. This was the last recording from Lizzie; we found her dead next morning. Our grief was painful and our mourning long. It was a great disappointment to lose her just as she started to make sounds of this sort. The term zoosemiotics-constructed in an exchange between Rulon Wells and me-is proposed for the discipline, within which the science of signs intersects with ethology, devoted to the scientific study of signalling behavior in and across animal species. A survey of the vast and widely ramified literature of ethology, supplemented by repeated spot checks of ongoing research projects, reveals that the study of signaling behavior in animals has, by and large, been taxonomically parochial: even Darwin's great pioneer work, on The expression of the emotions in man and animals (London, 1872), dealt, in the main, with the domestic cat and dog. A great variety of animals has since been more or less minutely scruti- nized, both in the natural environment (after J. S. Huxley and K. Lorenz) and 465</page><page sequence="19">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 39, NUMBER 3 (1963) in captivity (after H. Lissman and N. Tinbergen), but usually in one particular species (or, sometimes, in closely related forms, say, of the genus Apis) rather than guided by overarching theoretical considerations relevant to problems of communication in general, including especially speech. The task for the immediate future will be to treat, comprehensively and exhaustively, the achievements of zoosemiotics from Darwin through J. von Uexkiill to the present day; to arrange and display the data in a format relevant to the study of language, that is, by matching logical concepts derived from sociobiology with those developed in linguistics; and, using each species, so to say, as a miniature paradigm which throws light upon language observed as a peculiar combination of distinctive features, of which all or almost all components, considered alone, have their separate evolutionary roots,62 to consolidate and build upon what has been established about the protocultural foundations of human adaptation. Whitney's conception of language as a social institution, unfolded in necessary antithesis to Schleicher's simple-minded Darwinism, is now itself in need of re- vision as we recollect L. Bloomfield's aphorism:63 'Language creates and exempli- fies a twofold value of some human actions.' Language has, as he put it, both a biophysical and a biosocial aspect. Speech is, of course, a biological phenomenon in several related senses. Since all systems in science have a biological compo- nent, the linguistic system observed includes the linguist-observer.64 Speech, furthermore, is carried on by human beings, a species of animal; it is not only a part of animal behavior but undoubtedly the principal means of biological adaptation for man, an evolutionary specialization that arose from prehuman be- havioral adaptation of which we seek to trace the paths as one objective of zoosemiotics. In 1936 Jakobson asked, in Copenhagen:65 'Est-il besoin aujourd'hui de rappeler que la linguistique appartient aux sciences sociales et non a l'histoire naturelle? N'est-ce pas un truisme evident?' Twenty-five years later, he himself gave the answer as, in Helsinki, he called attention to the 'direct homology be- tween the logic of molecular and phonemic codes',66 implying a vision of new and startling dimensions: the convergence of the science of genetics with the science of linguistics. A fundamental unity of viewpoint has been provided by the discovery that the problem of heredity lies, in effect, in the decipherment of a script, that genes are sections of the molecular chains of DNA which contain messages coded in particular sequences of nucleotide bases,67 in a manner per- suasively reminiscent of the way in which bundles of binary features are linked into sequences of phonemes. Genetics and linguistics thus emerge as autonomous yet sister disciplines in the larger field of communication sciences, to which, on the molar level, zoosemiotics also contributes. 62 Cf. 0.
