<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wellsprings of Belonging: Water and Community Regeneration in Queensland Veronica Strang University of Auckland ABSTRACT This article considers how local communities in South Queensland make use of the cultural meanings encoded in water to articulate social connections and notions of belonging. Draw- ing on recent ethnographic research, it compares the activities of a community catchment group in Brisbane, and participants in a water festival in Maroochydore, exploring how each group engages creatively with local water sources to materialise particular beliefs and values about identity and belonging. Their creative efforts range from conventional attempts to strengthen local community ties through inclusion in catchment management, to more subversive visions, which resist inclusion in the mainstream and promulgate 'alternative' social and environmental values. Key words: water, identity, community, activism, resource, management. Based on long-term ethnographic research,' this article presents a comparative view of two groups in Queensland: a local catchment management group in Brisbane, and the partici- pants in a bi-annual water festival in Maroochydore. Both are composed of social networks whose purpose is to engage with local water issues and participate in the management and protection of local waterways. In doing so, both groups articulate notions of connection and belonging, and collective responsibility for environmental care. However, their visions of what constitutes care, and their forms of knowledge and discourse differ considerably. Through the ethnography, this article attempts to show how their particular approaches serve to reveal some of the underlying differences in social and environmental knowledges and values which underpin wider debates on water issues in Australia. These differences are both intellectual and political. At a conceptual level, they make use of somewhat differing models of human environmental relationships, on the one hand subscribing to a largely technical model in which humankind and 'nature' are considered dualistically and, on the other, making use of a more holistic model, in which humankind is perceived as being within and integral to 'nature'. As Descola and Palsson have made plain (1996), the former vision is one that dominates the environmental relationships of Western societies, and reflects the abstraction and conceptual compartmentalisation of large industri- alised societies. Thus the spiritual and social meanings of water are expressed mainly in abstract terms within the context of religious activities and media, and water is more gener- ally presented as either part of nature (with a focus on the scientific and technical protection of ecosystems) or as a material resource: an economic commodity fundamental to processes of production and central to political economy (Bakker 2003; Swyngedouw 2004). There is, in this dualistic frame, a conceptual alienation of humankind from 'nature' with 'the envi- ronment' seen as a separate material context to be acted upon directively. Some writers have argued that this is also an intensely masculine approach, which subsumes a more femi- 30 Oceania 78, 2008</page><page sequence="2">Strang nine concern with social relations, and thus expresses gender and power relations (Coles and Wallace 2005; Lahiri-Dutt 2006). A product of large-scale, highly mobile capitalist societies, such a distanced vision is somewhat at odds with the development of deep affec- tive attachments to place (Milton 2002). The latter integrated view is widely seen as more typical of indigenous cosmologies in Australia and elsewhere (eg. Morphy 1991, Rose 1992, Strang 1997). It is egalitarian, in that it situates humankind in partnership with the environment, and it is holistic, in that social, spiritual, political and economic issues are bound together through the medium of the landscape. Humans are thus not conceptually alienated from the places and the material environments that they inhabit, instead enjoying deep affective attachment to these and hav- ing a commensurate concern to achieve sustainable modes of production and ensure the long-term well-being of social and ecological systems. In considering these alternative models, and the kinds of human-environmental relationships they produce, a familiar theo- retical comparison is Ingold's vision of 'lifeworlds' conceived as 'gazed upon' globes and 'inhabited' spheres (2000). As noted elsewhere (Strang 1997), such contrasting worldviews go hand in hand with quite different environmental beliefs and values. In considering these differences it is important to begin with the caveat that such com- parisons comprise yet another dualism, which like all such reductive devices, does not rep- resent the complexities of either alternative, or the reality that each contains substantial ele- ments of the other. There is, in any case, an entire debate about the veracity of an image of indigenous relationships with the environment as a polarised opposite to those of large industrialised societies (eg. Brosius 1997, Ellen 1986). There is no need (and insufficient space) to revisit this debate here, but whether such representation is romantic, or whether it genuinely reflects the realities of more localised and stable modes of environmental engage- ment, it offers a heuristically useful comparative perspective. Representations of indigenous environmental relations offer an implicit critique of more compartmentalised worldviews and the unsustainable environmental relationships that these permit (eg. Rose and Clarke 1997; Watkins 2000). In general, contrasts are drawn between 'Western' and indigenous societies, and there is a growing number of ethnographies which make use of this comparative potential to con- sider broader global differences in modes of environmental interaction (at times I have done so myself). However, larger industrial societies are by no means homogenous: they contain a diverse spectrum of groups, some of whom are inspired by and strive to emulate the kinds of environmental relationships represented by indigenous people (Berglund 1998; Milton 1993; Strang 2004). For these groups, the social meanings encoded in water are as impor- tant as its role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. Their activities reflect this different emphasis, focusing on creative activities that express ideas about community and attach- ment to place, and which celebrate spiritual and aesthetic interactions with water. These pri- orities are very different from those of more conventional water management groups. This article therefore considers two local water groups: one that is orientated towards well-established 'scientific' modes of catchment management, and another that offers an alternative perspective. It explores their different approaches and the beliefs and values that these express. Both groups interact directly with local waterways through a range of activi- ties and, as the ethnography makes plain, many such activities are highly performative and ritualised, underlining the importance of ritual behaviour and sensory involvement in the expression and affirmation of cultural or sub-cultural values. It is also evident that each group's activities both express and engender sympathy for particular political ideologies (Kratz 1994; Parkin and Caplan 1996), positioning them in wider debates about the owner- ship and control of water. 31</page><page sequence="3">Wellsprings of Belonging ON MOGGILL CREEK The Moggill Creek Catchment Group (MCCG) is a local catchment management group in Brisbane. There are about 36 such groups, working on the many small creeks that run into the Brisbane River. The Moggill Creek group is one of the most successful of these: it attracts high numbers of participants; organises regular, well-attended activities; and has garnered considerable financial support and expert assistance. Like most such groups, it has been established by local actors in collaboration with (and with the support of) various Gov- ernment agencies. It therefore reflects a typical process in which prominent actors within a local social network come together with local Government experts to consolidate their activities into a more formal organisation which then, through its representations and activi- ties, develops a definable collective identity and serves to articulate the shared aims and values of the group. Moggill Creek emerges in the western uplands of the city, in an area originally logged for its red cedar and hoop pine in the 1800s. A reminder of this history remains in the Raft- ing Ground Park, from which logs used to be floated down the river. The catchment was then cleared for agriculture: There was a lot of fruit growing - we've been here forty years and when we came here there were bananas and pawpaws being grown on a lot of the hillsides, cus- tard apples to some degree. In the valleys there was a big market garden, vegeta- bles and so on, a little bit of dairy farming... So it was quite a farming area. (Bryan Hacker) Much of the catchment is still a semi-rural area with some sizeable blocks of grazing land and forest, but as agriculture became less profitable and the city was expanding, the process of sub-division and development gathered pace. Many former farms are now small- er 'lifestyle blocks', and a number of the catchment landowners keep horses, as the area hosts one of the biggest annual horse shows in Brisbane. While the clearing and farming caused soil erosion, the more recent population of the catchment by people who often have full-time jobs elsewhere has tended to mean more laissez faire forms of management, and invasive weeds such as asparagus vine, cat's claw and lantana are now a major environmen- tal problem within the catchment: They [these weeds] are swamping the vegetation. They're just over-running it and killing it and they are no use to the native fauna and they are knocking out the flora on which a lot of the native fauna relies. (Bryan Hacker) As it gets closer to the river, the creek runs through one of Brisbane's most pleasant and affluent suburbs. The catchment area is therefore largely inhabited by well-educated profes- sional families, who own their own homes, some of which come with sizeable parcels of land. The composition of the MCCG reflects this demographic reality. Its committee con- tains - or draws on the expertise of - a number of academics and students from the nearby University, whose disciplinary interests are mainly in subjects such as botany, environmen- tal studies, geology and psychology. The MCCG has a formally elected committee: a Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Public Relations officer and so forth, as well as 13 section leaders, each responsible for a particular length of the creek. Some of the members of the group are also experienced managers, and it conducts its business in a commensurately professional manner. It holds regular, carefully minuted meetings. It has a lively web site and a database of about 300 members who have varying degrees of involvement in its activities. Having gained funding from bodies such as the National Heritage Trust, the Envirofund and the Brisbane City Council (BCC), it keeps 32</page><page sequence="4">Strang formal accounts. It has a strategic plan, and hopes to establish some sort of 'eco-centre'. The group collaborates closely with the Brisbane City Council and Habitat Brisbane, and maintains a range of links with other catchment groups. It liaises with local businesses, some of whom sponsor its activities, and it maintains its relationship with its local commu- nity through newsletters, posters, and other representational forms, for example articles in local newsarticles, signage at sites and so on. As the MCCG Chair explains, the group emerged from a local Council initiative in the late 1990s: 'Many of the catchment groups arose in response to the initiative from the coun- cil. So it wasn't driven totally by the local community' (Bryan Hacker). The local Council devised several catchment plans for the main River catchment and organised a Brisbane Catchments Network to coordinate local catchment groups. More recently, the South-East Queensland regional body was set up to funnel Commonwealth Government funding into local catchment group activities, and the MCCG benefited from this, having for several years a coordinator that they shared with the nearby Brisbane Forest Park. At a local level the MCCG had some long-running antecedents, for example in the Rural Environment Planning Association (REPA), which over the last 30 years had tried to exert some restraining influence on the rapid process of sub-division and development that began to transform the area in the 1970s. I think we've taken over the certainly more sort of biological type activities that REPA was involved in... REPA felt that there was a need for this sort of work to be done and so was doing it, but then when the catchment group started up... REPA stood back and said, 'Well that's what you're doing. Carry on..'. There's no point in competing... A lot of the catchment membership is also REPA membership. (Bryan and Jenny Hacker) The composition of the executive and core members of the group reflects these interests, and it contains a high proportion of people with expertise in the natural sciences. The group recruits the members of its committee partly by advertising in its newsletter and via a colourful brochure, but mainly through social contacts. As Bryan Hacker observes: 'When we need a position like a Treasurer or a Secretary, we tend to rely on one or other of us say- ing, 'I know a person up the valley who could perhaps fill that role'. The group is therefore led by a close social network of like-minded people who know each other as friends and neighbours, or as professional contacts. The MCCG has some major aims, some of which echo the responsibilities of local Government agencies: Caring for biodiversity and caring for land and caring for water, and participation - publicity and participation... It's a very standard set of themes which runs through catchment activities throughout the area... But certainly in caring for land, a lot of the objectives we identified are ones that are being looked after to a con- siderable degree by REPA... We're very strong in the biodiversity area and we're strong in the publicity area. But caring for land and caring for water, I'm afraid we just don't have the people to do it properly... There's a feeling that we should be doing more water monitoring. The Environmental Protection Agency is no longer monitoring water quality in Moggill Creek. (Bryan Hacker) But the group also recognises that, in a catchment area of just under 60 square kilometres, there are limits to its abilities to provide sufficient labour, skills and technology for regular scientific monitoring and management over the long term, or to protect riparian areas in which major developments have radically changed the flow patterns of the creek, with major stormwater runoffs and foul flooding (ie. letting sewage into the creek). 33</page><page sequence="5">Wellsprings of Belonging The MCCG organises a range of different activities: it runs a nursery which provides flora not just for the public areas of the creek but also, in the common interest, to 150 or so riparian landholders. In the last couple of years it has provided them with about ten thou- sand seedlings, and there is a team of approximately a dozen people who come in several times a month to pot up seeds. The nursery provides an important social centre: The nursery has been running virtually since we started. It's on Brisbane Forest Park land and they built the nursery and a couple of little offices there and put on the watering system and so on.... It's an extremely good forum for a lot of people who can't help in any other way: there are quite a lot of people who are ageing a bit, who don't feel they can swing a mattock any more. They're very happy to come around once or twice a month and pot up our seedlings and they talk about what birds they've seen on their property and whatever the issues may be, and it's like a good bonding exercise.... It's become, from what I've heard, quite a social event and people enjoy it very much. (Bryan and Jenny Hacker) The catchment group also conducts surveys of plants and wildlife and holds training workshops. It has a stall each year at the Brookfield Show, and runs photography competi- tions which are exhibited at the local shopping centre. Key issues for the group (as well as weed and feral animal invasion) include water quality issues; wildlife conservation and con- cerns about mountain biking and other activities creating erosion and disturbance in the catchment area. It publishes material in its newsletter about related groups and activities, and liaises with a range of groups: for example Natural Resources Management South East Queensland regional group; the Healthy Waterways Partnership and the Environmental Pro- tection Agency. The most regular activities are the group's working bees, usually held on the last Sun- day of each month, in which its section leaders and other key players encourage local vol- unteers to clear non-native plants and weeds from the public areas of the creek and plant native trees and shrubs. The group coordinator reported some typical events to the AGM: The Brookfield Country Market on 16th October was a busy and fruitful day. The MCCG display was erected and the butterfly plants (Pararistolochia praevenosa) were completely sold out... Half a dozen new members and one renewal signed up on the day and volunteers Don Sands, Dale Borgelt, Gaynor Johnson and myself were flat out keeping up with inquiries! Weedbuster Week also went very well... Moons Reserve (Section 1) had a busy Weedbuster event on 17th October with approximately 26 people turning up for the Moon's Reserve's first working bee. Thank you to Andrew Wilson and Don Sands for coming along to provide technical instruction and to Judy Walker for networking with the locals and gaining community involvement. Happily a Sec- tion Leader has now been found to keep the momentum going at this important site... Michael Humphries (Section 12) also had a successful working bee on 26th Octo- ber and was supported by approximately 25 volunteers... Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School held another planting on 11th November. Bryan Hacker and I were in attendance to 'supervise' this organised chaos... As always it was great fun to work with a succession of enthusiastic children rang- ing from classes 2 to 7 and they were given MCCG stickers and Green Garden Guide Booklets to take home. . . [The] Summer Newsletter has now been pretty much finalised by Graeme Wilson and will be distributed at the beginning of December. (Chris Hosking, November 2004) 34</page><page sequence="6">Strang Fig. 1 Advertisement for a Working Bee Much of this work is done by eight small bush care groups, supported directly by Habitat Brisbane, who focus on particular public sections of the creek and are sometimes only loosely involved with the MCCG as a whole. A working bee in Kenmore provides an example: this is an area that has been fairly recently developed. In accord with the other parts of the Moggill catchment, it is composed of large family homes, each surrounded by quite generous leafy gardens. The creek and its riparian areas now constitutes a communal park winding through the new estates: there is a concrete cycle path along its banks, and at regular intervals, areas of green lawn with bar- beque facilities, shaded picnic tables, children's playgrounds, and toilets. The event took place near the local school, and was timed to coincide with a Planet Ark initiative for a tree planting day. It therefore focused on planting (rather than weed clearing) the objective being to dig holes, and plant and water approximately 460 tree seedlings along 35</page><page sequence="7">Wellsprings of Belonging the edge of the creek. On this occasion the working bee brought in about 45 volunteers, the Planet Ark event doubling the more usual 20 or so. These were generally local residents as well as some people who found out about the event from the MCCG's web site - mainly families with small children, and older, retired people, but there were also some teenagers, and some young professionals. Most were European-Australians, with a few Asian and African individuals. There were no Aboriginal people. The event was well supported by local Government agencies and industry. A Council- lor, Margaret de Wit, looked in to provide encouragement, and Tom McHugh, a member of Habitat Brisbane, came to provide support. Some of the people carefully digging holes were being sponsored by Ergon Energy on behalf of its 'green team' who, as well as participating in this kind of thing to enhance the company's community outreach, hope to encourage tree planters to make sure that their efforts are placed so as to be 'power line friendly' (Blondine Cousin). Fig. 2 Tree planting. The group's activities were carefully coordinated and somewhat ritualised. The event began in the early morning, with a view to getting the job done while the day was still cool. As people arrived each was asked to sign an insurance form. They were then issued with mattocks, gloves and spades, and directed by the section leader, Malcolm Frost, towards specific tasks. The event had required forward preparation. Tools had been brought, hosepipes had been connected to nearby standpipes, and buckets provided to carry water up from these or from the creek to water the seedlings as they went in. The Council had supplied a large amount of mulch to protect the new trees. Cold water was provided for the workers throughout the morning, and snacks and drinks had been brought for the conclusion of the event. Some families had also brought picnics. These refreshments were welcome by late morning, when all 460 trees had been planted. The Moggill Creek group has been active for some years, with the result that, in planti- ng this section of the creek, longer-term participants were also able to inspect sections a lit- tle way upstream, which they had planted in previous years, and to chart the progress of 36</page><page sequence="8">Strang each 'year' of trees. They were also able to discern changes in the creek, commenting that it is much lower now than it was a decade ago ('when this was only green fields'), because of land development, new dams and landscaping, and the recent years of drought. Previously, the water was deep enough for children to ride horses into the waterholes to swim: now the water levels are very low, and the water quality is more dubious. Nevertheless, it was plain that, while some of the problems in the creek are the direct result of the development that has enlarged the local population, the group lavishes consid- erable care on the creek. This exercise has considerable meaning for them: quite young chil- dren recalled which trees they had planted in previous years, and one mother commented that the kids had all wanted to have their names on the trees they planted. The Planet Ark link brought in a number of new people for this particular tree planting, but it was evident that the major actors in the group were well known to each other. The MCCG's Publicity Officer, Christine Hosking, describes the group as being composed of a series of concentric circles: an 'inner circle' of very committed individuals; a larger circle of 'doers'; a wider one of people who are sometimes involved but 'come in and out more'; and one of casual, occasional participation. She suggested that, like a number of others, she had joined the group when her children left home, feeling a need to do something worth- while, and this had led to a course in landscaping. As Margaret de Wit observed, social net- working is a central part of these events, or as Tom McHugh put it, 'this is how they get to know their neighbours'. At the time of writing, the group was conducting its own research into people's motivations for participating, with the help of a psychologist, Brad Jorgensen at the University of Queensland. Bryan and Jenny Hacker describe a range of motivations for the group: Some of them do so to gain power - they like controlling things. Some do it to gain the experience and they're just in it for a couple of years, and they can use that when they are applying for a job. In our case, I suspect the majority do it because they like to feel by contributing they are making our area a better place. Some might do it because they're frightened of Malcolm! (Bryan Hacker) They described their own motivations too: I think a sense of duty as far as I'm concerned. I care about it, you know. When I took my dad around two years back, he was saying how lucky we were that there weren't little houses all over the place. I was thinking, 'Well, maybe the fights we've had are worthwhile'... The environment - stewardship... It's not necessarily your social contacts - you have a knowledge, therefore you feel you shouldn't be squandering it... I think it's more concern for the environment of the area. For many people the driving force is money, or fast cars or sport, or whatever. They don't give a damn about whether something is a Chinese elm or a lantana... (Bryan and Jenny Hacker) There is also a strong element of problem solving, meeting challenges and recreating a pre- vious ecological order: We started off with the concept that we would like to restore the water weeds to the condition that they were in, [or] as close as possible to the condition they were in two hundred years ago... Now, how one goes about this is very difficult. Where the vegetation is cleared away from around waterways, there's too much light, the water is a higher temperature - you know all this stuff... I think most of us Gree- nies have the idea that we'd like to restore the vegetation along our bit of creek. (Bryan Hacker) 37</page><page sequence="9">Wellsprings of Belonging Thus the group has lively debates about whether it should rely on purely local genetic stock (which in some cases is very limited) or bring in new stock from further afield. How- ever, it achieves a broad consensus on what are regarded as weeds, while accepting that some of the exotic plants brought in for purely decorative purposes, such as the omnipresent jacarandás, have aesthetic value to many people. We do find people who are leaving camphor laurels because they are pretty trees... when I'm talking to landowners, I can say, 'Well I can't criticise you because I've got two big jacarandás out here and they're a weed species too,' and I wouldn't chop them down for anything. So you can't be didactic. (Bryan Hacker) Through its caretaking rituals and wider activities, the MCCG has succeeded in gener- ating a collective sense of ownership and responsibility in relation to a shared cultural waterscape, and in doing so, contributed to the social cohesion of a relatively new local community, enabling its members to identify with their local area and with like-minded neighbours. It is greatly enabled in this by the reality that many of its members also own small patches of the catchment area, and are thus able to act directly upon them. Although putatively directed towards conventional ecological management, it supports social needs as well, providing a way in which local residents can meet and act collectively, and construct both social and environmental relationships. These relationships are further linked with wider social networks and larger agencies involved in environmental management. The group's social network provides close ties with the institutions of governance and education, and it is empowered by considerable sup- port from these. In turn, it engages with the catchment area in a way that effectively extends the ability of local government organisations to manage the cultural landscape and the waterways of the Brisbane area. In the activities of the group it is possible to see, underlying it, an implicit vision of particular social order. Many of the residents in the catchment have been there for many decades, and are much attached to the area. They have a clear idea of how the catchment should be populated and managed, expressed for example in the way that MCCG recruits its executive officers, and in resistance to the pollution of incomers in excessive numbers despoiling the catchment with little houses all over the place', and in the emotive force of the group's passion for re-ordering the local ecology. The MCCG's activities also enable a direct physical engagement with the creek and its environs. There is sensory pleasure in digging holes in the mud and pouring water in them, in handling the delicate tree seedlings and scattering sweet smelling mulch around them. For people mainly confined to office work, the opportunity to physically exert themselves in a common task is rewarding. Nevertheless, the discourses of the group are heavily dominated by scientific and eco- logical concerns, and the meanings that are foregrounded in this conceptual model present water as the basis for ecological rather than social regeneration. In this respect the MCCG conforms to mainstream patterns of water resource management, valorising particular knowledges and values, and enacting these in material terms. Moggill Creek is thus the object of an explicit shared scientific and managerial task, and the basis of a more implicit form of social cohesion. MAKING A SPLASH! A less conventional mode of engagement is expressed by the Splashl Festival in Maroochy- dore, on the 'Sunshine Coast' north of Brisbane. Splashl has taken place every two years since 1999, and is organised by a partnership between Maroochy Water Watch and a Festival design team. The latter is composed of an artistic director, a community co-ordinator, a dance co-ordi- 38</page><page sequence="10">Strang nator and a music coordinator, and several local artists, including an indigenous artist. This team provides links with the wider social network of music groups and artists who perform or exhibit at the Festival (as well as in local exhibitions and related events). Demographically, the Festival brings together a very different social mix from that found in the Moggill Creek catchment area. It is younger, less academically inclined, and in general less well-off. Most of those centrally involved could be loosely described as mem- bers of the 'alternative' community, which tends to place them in the lower economic brackets and on the political left. Many are urban dwellers and live in rented accommoda- tion, and thus have little direct ownership of the Maroochy River catchment area. In some cases their domestic arrangements focus around 'alternative' lifestyle block ownership and communal living experiments of various kinds. The catchment itself is about an hour's drive from Brisbane and is located in an attractive rural area, highlighted by the dramatic landscapes of the Crystal Mountains and Maleny. It has long been popular with 'blockies', and there is a high number of New Age 'retreats' and spas, cottage craft enterprises, nature parks, small organic horticultural businesses and hobby farms. Though 'alternative' in its demographics and activities, this is fundamentally a rural community in which people know each other through participation in local events and everyday activities. The Festival Com- mittee is therefore readily able to disseminate information about its activities by word of mouth, and (like the MCCG), supplements these with a newsletter, advertising and a web site. In the range of people involved in the Festival, there is some overlap with the member- ship of local catchment care groups or wildlife conservation organisations. Thus the Splashl Festival provides stalls enabling a number of these groups to advertise their activities. Other than this, however, it has little engagement with the kind of scientific, managerial perspec- tive that dominates the MCCG and other catchment groups. Instead it is deliberately direct- ed towards what could be considered as the opposite perspective: one that focuses entirely on social, spiritual and aesthetic interactions with the local waterways. In its own way this is as one-sided as its polar opposite, reflecting a conventional art-science, female-male dichotomy, but like the Moggill Creek Catchment Group, it contains implicit elements of its oppositional 'other' in its attempts to encourage change in environmental practices. For the Splashl Festival, though, the route to this is via collective social change, rather than through the managerial application of science. By conflating concepts of community and ecological well-being, and presenting the local waterways as a 'connective element', the purpose of the Festival is to challenge and subvert what it perceives as an exploitative and materialistic use of land and resources and encourage people to embrace more holistic and sustainable forms of interaction with the environment. The Festival organisers describe it as: ...a unique educational resource connecting people to the waterways environments and thus towards the solutions for our environment. A community based cultural celebration of the Sunshine Coast waterways and people from the range to the sea... Splashl is an opportunity for communities to creatively explore our relation- ship to the waterways. And in doing so, be aware of how we are connected to other communities via these waterways. (Kingfisher Connection, Bulletin 11. 2004:1) The Festival actually begins some time before the main event. There is a range of workshops over the preceding weeks, in which the artists involved help schools, colleges, arts organisations and community groups, as well as local councils and businesses, to create the artworks and performances that constitute Splashl These are all exhibited or performed during an intensive one-day Festival that combines music, dance, theatre, storytelling, par- ticipatory sculpture and various forms of 'play' with hydrolatrous rituals invented specifi- cally for the event. 39</page><page sequence="11">Wellsprings of Belonging The Festival organisers have been able to garner financial support from various agen- cies, either on the basis of the event's 'artistic' contribution, or in the hope that it will assist the efforts of more managerial agencies to achieve greater environmental and social sustain- ability, for example by persuading people to conserve water or participate in river catch- ment care. It is therefore included as a National Water Week event, and funded by several bodies including Arts Queensland, Festivals Australia, Maroochy Shire Council and Healthy Waterways. It is further supported by the International Volunteers for Peace; by large environmental organisations, such as Green Corps; and by a number of smaller local catchment groups. In the direct organisation of the event, Maroochy Water Watch works in partnership with the Festival design team to coordinate the participating groups and their various contributions. As one of the pre-Festival newsletters put it: Splashl is like a jigsaw puzzle. Each group creates a piece/a chapter. Together we will tell the story of the Sunshine Coast waterways. (Kingfisher Connection. Bul- letin 11. 2004:1) The Festival takes place on Chambers Island, which is an islet (little more than a sand spit really) in the Maroochy River. Though connected to the town esplanade by a pedestrian bridge, the islet usefully provides a context spatially separated from 'mainland' life, and sit- uated quite literally 'in the river'. The Festival has a 'totem', which in 2004 was the green frog, chosen because this species is a key ecological health indicator. Thus lanterns, t-shirts and people were liberally sprinkled with green footprints, whose purpose is explained as follows: Footprints; where we go, what we leave behind. The frog: an environmental indi- cator. Follow; learn, look, watch, follow the lead, connect people, land and water. What message do we receive? (Splashl 2004:1). Participants paid $2 for access to the bridge, and the image of a green frog was stamped on their wrists to provide an entry ticket to the event and identify them with it. Crossing the water, they were met by the banners, posters and stalls of the various groups involved: there were large paintings of different river catchments; stalls presenting informa- tion about local endangered species or recruiting for green groups; some arts and crafts exhibitions; organic food stalls and, for later on, a 'South Sea Island Hangi' [sand oven]. As the Festival fliers put it: Welcome all from the land and the island. The rivers have called us. The creeks, tributaries and estuaries have too. (Splashl 2004:1) Scattered across the island was a variety of art exhibits focused on aquatic and environ- mental themes. Most had been commissioned especially for the event, and in 2004 included an anthropomorphic 'tree being'; an aquatic 'house', frog silhouettes, and papier mache water symbols. Even the public toilets were decorated with an aquatic mural. Other art- works, such as a 'footprint mandala' and a frog 'sand sculpture', were constructed on the day itself. Creative activities were organised throughout the day and many of these were for chil- dren. They included the making of butterflies and organic boats, and the face painting with- out which such an event would be incomplete. A mini-stage/sculpture was created for a children's theatre group, which performed a heartfelt play describing the destruction of 'Spring Town' by the evils of over-development. Also wandering around was a street the- atre group, dressed as eccentric 'detectives', whose aim was to elicit help from the visitors in 'finding the footprints of the frog'. The mainstay of the Festival was a series of perfor- 40</page><page sequence="12">Strang manees from musical groups, school dance and theatre groups, and a group of Shire Council employees, who mimed a tree-planting event. The audiences were of all ages, with an emphasis on young families, and they meandered informally from one performance to another. Later in the day, the events coalesced. The bands formed up and began to move around the island, their paths deliberately echoing the winding flow of water. One group, its mem- bers dressed as water nymphs, played flutes made of water pipes. Another crossed the bridge to the mainland to lead a carnival 'parade' back across to the island. The parade included various totemic animals; the totemic frog; a birdwing butterfly (which is an endan- gered species), and a large duck-billed platypus. As it flowed off the bridge, the organisers instructed sections of the audience to follow these animals and the musicians weaving like pied pipers around the island. Meanwhile canoes carrying black swan sculptures and Abo- riginal dancers from the local Gubbi Gubbi community were paddled across from the far shore. The water ceremony invites us all into a circle. The Gubbi-Gubbi dance their ways of following nature's example. (Splashl flier 2004:1) Eventually the various flows of people were brought together at the northern end of the island for the high point of the day, which occurred at sunset. This was the ceremonial Touring of the Waters', in which, accompanied by a generic blessing, water from each of the local rivers (contained in a variety of vessels, all made from 'natural' materials) was poured into a large central vessel to express the social and ecological connections between the communities living in each catchment area. After dark, further musical events supported the 'Butterfly Ball', which was simultaneously a costume party and a general 'end of Festi- val' social gathering. Fig. 3 Ceremonial water vessels Through these activities the Splash ! Festival sketches a cultural landscape in which the social and spiritual meanings encoded in water are placed firmly in the foreground. It open- ly celebrates the idea of water as the essence of social identity and communitas. In doing so, 41</page><page sequence="13">Wellsprings of Belonging it draws uninhibitedly upon several cosmological traditions: indigenous beliefs about water as the source of ancestral regenerative powers; Celtic and neo-Pagan animism in which water is seen as containing sentient deities; Christian visions of water as of the essence of the holy spirit and social being; and ecological ideas in which water is framed more prag- matically as a 'source of life'. As well as referring explicitly to these meanings, the Festival takes this a step further, by ensuring that almost all of its events are actively created by local community groups, and in carrying the semi-religiosity of Art to its logical extreme, which is the invention of trans- formative religious rituals. The participants are encouraged to 'play' creatively and hedonis- tically. They take part in emotive ritual behaviour, and identify with the water itself. Thus they become - in the true sense of the word - a 'congregation', participating in collective aesthetic, emotional and sensory experiences that challenge their inculcated knowledge and ways of being in the world. In this way the Festival relies on classic methods of 'enlightenment', using rituals, sound, poetry, movement and visual stimuli to shift people out of their everyday modes of thinking and action, into the adoption and embodiment of new ideas and values. Under the rubric of 'artistic licence' it appropriates and subverts several models of social and environ- mental interaction, creatively amalgamating ideas about indigenous, neo-Pagan, New Age and 'green' relationships with place, in order to proselytise a new paradigm and encourage the adoption of 'alternative' values. This vision was encapsulated by a number of the people interviewed on the island, for example Juanita, who described herself, on a beautifully dec- orative business card, as a 'Messenger of Light'. 'Many people need awakening', she said and 'those of us who are awake are awakening others'. This appropriation and recontextualisation of ideas, and the bricolage of religious and secular concepts, is crucial in providing the moral underpinning for the major themes of the Festival: a determination to affirm the social aspects of engagements with water, and the importance of community, and a related plea for more sustainable forms of environmental interaction. In this sense it challenges the technical model of environmental management that dominates the activities of government agencies and conventional catchment manage- ment groups, proposing instead that sustainability will only come through a resanctification of the environment, and greater valorisation of its non-human elements, and the re-estab- lishment of community ties and long-term, affective relationships with place. This is not a new message of course: Friends of the Earth made it clear in the 1960s and 70s that the environmental movement was equally concerned with social issues. How- ever, although FOE and other long-standing activist groups have continued to foreground the need for social change and a more holistic approach to human-environmental engage- ment, many contemporary 'green' groups have shifted towards a more specialised - and far less politically challenging - 'scientific' focus on ecology and resource management that sits quite comfortably in the context of an economic system still firmly wedded to continual growth and expansion. This shift is clearly reflective of a political reality dominated by eco- nomic rationalism and right-wing ideology. This dominance is plainly reflected in public policy that, though it is willing to support uncontroversial economic and scientific approaches to environmental 'services', is intrinsically exclusive of wider social and eco- logical concerns. The Splashl Festival can therefore be seen, in some ways, as an attempt to foreground and thus to revitalise the fundamental principles of the feminist and environmental move- ments that demanded equality both for people, and for 'nature', and which make use of more holistic models of human-environmental relationships, in which social and ecological health are seen as mutually constituted. This points to another innovative aspect of the Festival which is that, rather than simply presenting a loose romantic vision of indigenous beliefs and values, as often happens in New Age events, the Festival relies upon the active participation of the local indigenous 42</page><page sequence="14">Strang community, and indigenous artists play an important leadership role in its design. This has been particularly influential in establishing a set of practices that valorise co-identification between people and aspects of their local environments. Fig. 4 Musical water nymphs. Thus there is the communal production of material culture that celebrates totemic species, and performances in which people are imaginatively transformed into aquatic ani- mals, butterflies, and water itself. As has been made clear by a number of writers on envi- ronmental issues, this co-identification with place and with aspects of the local environment is crucial to the generation of deep affective concern for its well-being (eg. Milton 2002, Strang 2005). In this sense, the involvement of indigenous participants has helped the groups concerned to articulate their ideas and develop a poetic language with which to describe connective social and environmental relationships. There are some undeniable tensions in this respect. On the one hand the Festival sets up a partnership with the local indigenous community and offers a subtextual critique of colonial hegemony and its social and environmental outcomes, but on the other, it also serves to express - and aims to strengthen - the affective attachment and 'belonging in place' of the non-indigenous communities in the area. This could be interpreted as an align- ment between 'alternative' minorities, or - as the rather caustic remarks of an Aboriginal spokesperson from a neighbouring community made plain - less benignly, as a further appropriation of indigenous knowledge and land. In a political context where special treat- ment for indigenous people is being lambasted by right-wing groups as undemocratic and discriminatory, the inclusi veness of the Festival's vision of a community of belonging, and its efforts to express the equality of all humankind, may be somewhat of a double-edged sword. Much of the support that the Festival garners comes from the fact that its organisers have been astute in presenting their social and environmental 'message' under the apparent- ly benign umbrella of an Arts Festival. They are not the first to rely upon the protective mystification of art to disseminate a political critique of dominant paradigms: there is a well 43</page><page sequence="15">Wellsprings of Belonging established tradition of this in the Arts, and organisations such as Common Ground in the UK and others have long recognised the utility of engendering social and environmental action through the licence provided by artistic events. Another example is the 'Tipping Point' conferences that take place annually in the UK, bringing climate change scientists and artists together in a creative collaboration. And Brisbane has its own (very large) annual River Festival, which also aims to bring science and art together in a productive way (Strang in press). Through their engagements with water, both the Splashl Festival and the MCCG work to construct and maintain local communities, but the social networks that they are attempt- ing to strengthen and regenerate, and the ideologies that they support are quite different from each other. Each has its own discourses, forms of knowledge, inculcatory ritual activi- ties and values. Each can be broadly aligned with competing conceptual models of 'the environment' and political positions, one of which hopes to critique and subvert a particular status quo, and the other which acts to uphold it. What is clear is that the Festival promulgates a vision of human-environmental engage- ment that differs substantially from the forms of knowledge and the values expressed by the Moggill Creek catchment management group. Underlying the jolly music and the totemic parade of the Splashl Festival is a recurrent unease: a sense that a primarily managerial, directive view of human-environmental relationships is too narrow and excludes things that matter. However, although Splashl owes much to the influence of intensely local and holistic indigenous worldviews, and offers a vision of social and aesthetic rather than ecological order, it remains ineluctably an abstract Western vision in which 'the environment' is a somewhat distanced object. In this sense it confirms Argyrou's assertion that contemporary environmen- talism remains a 'modernist project' (1995). The Festival is an ephemeral event, and it is diffi- cult to say what the outcomes would be if it was accompanied by similar activities on a regu- lar basis, or if the participants were empowered by land ownership, economic strength or links with Government bodies to act upon the waterways more directly. As it stands, it may have rather less capacity for community building than the Moggill Creek group, in which long-term social relationships are constructed and local land and property owners are regularly brought together in collective enterprise that involves direct management of the material environment. It is plain that, empowered by its political and social relationships with governing elites, edu- cational institutions and industries, and by its reliance upon scientific authority, the MCCG has a greater capacity to act upon the local environment, to influence wider regional manage- ment and to affect the development of public policy. The Splashl Festival, while it benefits from some linkage with local government bodies and sponsors, has few powerful political alliances and only loose connections with groups underpinned by 'science'. Its 'artistic' nature, while it serves to obscure the political content of its message, also means that it can be readily marginalised, and excluded from the processes through which real managerial decisions are made about Queensland's river catchments. The Festival's alliance with indigenous people and their beliefs and values, while inspirational, is unlikely to be empowering in the contemporary political climate in Australia. What Splashl achieves, however, is an explicit commentary about the social aspects of people's engagements with water, which is generally absent from more focused scientific discourses, and which does exert its own influence upon local debates. It serves to foreground a critique of 'Western' engagements with the environment, mentioned at the beginning of this article that, having subsided somewhat since its emergence in the 1960s, is undergoing a resurgence as the realities of climate change and chronic water shortages hit home. This small comparison therefore brings to the surface some of the social, political and intellectual divisions that underlie contests over water in Australia, and which are manifest- ed in many of its river catchments. An understanding of these differences is useful for poli- 44</page><page sequence="16">Strang cy makers and water managers whose energies are directed towards encouraging communi- ty involvement in catchment management, and resolving conflicts between interest groups. The study makes an obvious case for combining the strengths of these different kinds of approaches, bringing social issues to the foreground for 'management' groups, and provid- ing more 'socially and artistically' inclined groups with greater potential to act upon their ideological aspirations. Such integration might enable some reconciliation of viewpoints that, at present, occupy opposing positions. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This article is an outcome of research conducted in Queensland 2002-2006 as part of a larger collaborative project with Sandy Toussaint. Entitled Under Water: a comparative ethnographic analysis of water use and resource management in Queensland and Western Australia, and funded by the Australian Research Council, this entailed ethnographic research in four river catchments, two in Queensland (the Brisbane River and the Mitchell River in Cape York) and two in Western Australia (the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley region, and the Swan River in Perth). I would like to thank Sandy Toussaint and participants in our 'water' session at the 2006 AAS Conference, who generated the lively discussions on which articles for this special issue of Oceania are based. I would also like to thank my informants in Queensland, who were immensely generous with their time and their thoughts. REFERENCES ARGYROU, V. 2005.
