<plain_text><page sequence="1">£13 255 ROCK ART OF NORTH YEMEN From 1981 to 1986 I participated in the archaeological projects and surveys of the Italian Archaeological Mission in North Yemen on behalf of ISMeO, Rome *. In this research, I was engaged mainly in studies of the remains of the ancient Southern Arabian kingdoms 1 and of Islamic architecture. It was, however, also possible to undertake some investigations on the rock art of this region, thus expanding our knowledge of this subject. Several studies on the rock art of Southern Arabia are now in preparation, or have already been published (cf. Jung 1989, 1990, a,b). These will enlarge a little our knowledge in an archaeological topic which, up to now, has been somewhat neglected. In this article I will sum up the first results of our research. Distribution of Rock Art Short reports and notices of rock art sites in North Yemen are scattered in numerous publications on various subjects. Only a very small number of these is dedicated principally to rock art. The reports and the findings of the Italian Archaeological Mission reveal about 60 known sites in North Yemen. The sites are listed and shortly described with a bibliography in my article «On Rock Art Research in North Yemen» (AION, in press). The enormously increased archaeological activities in Yemen by missions of various nations, such as France, West Germany, Italy and the USA, and the * I would like to express here my gratitude to Prof. Alessandro de Maigret, who gave me the opportunity to take part in the work of the Italian Archaeological Mission, to Prof. Umberto Scerrato for his helpful suggestions and to Dr. Paola Dettori and Dr. Dalu Jones for their friendly advice. 1 About the research of the Italian Archaeological Mission see DE Maigret et al. 1988, 1990, SCERRATO 1988, cf. also the short preliminary summary of my doctoral thesis presented at the University of Rome, 1986, Jung.</page><page sequence="2">256 Michael Jung [2} increased accessibility of hitherto unknown regions by the construction of new roads and tracks, will add new sites from year to year. Still in 1984 Yemeni rock art found no reference in a «World Report» about the investigations on rock art all over the world (Anati 1984). Anati lists for the Middle East (his area B) seven «major areas» of this art: Iran, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sinai/Egypt and Turkey (cf. fig. 5, and the register of «major sites», p. 55). He also mentions important distributions of rock pictures in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, but does not refer to Yemen at all. I suppose that in the near future North Yemen could also become a «major area of rock art» according to Anati's definition 2. Fig. 1 - Warrior of the «Oval-headed People Style» from Sacib Suhay bar/North Yemen (tentative drawing after Ryckmans 1959: pl. IV, fig. 4). Further knowledge will help to define more precisely the autonomy or the dependence of Yemeni rock art on that of Saudi Arabia. At least for some periods the rock art of Southern and Central Arabia appears to belong to one cultural area. This is suggested by direct stylistic contacts or affinities between the rock art of both these regions. So is, for example, the «Oval-headed People Style» of the Bronze Age which is spread over wide regions of Central and Southern Arabia (cf. Anati 1968a, Jung b), 2 A «major area» is «one which provides an outstanding contribution to the knowledge of the intellectual identity of early man. Most of the major areas have over 10.000 figures in a zone of less than 1.000 sq. km., but this is not a prerequisite» (Anati 1984: l4f.). De Bayle des Hermens (1976: 36) and also Kortler (in Červícek-Kortler 1979: 225) suppose thousands of rock pictures in North Yemen.</page><page sequence="3">[3] Rock Art of North Yemen 257 and the far more recent rock pictures of horsemen armed with long lances and stylized animal figures which are found in great numbers in both Central and Southern Arabia (see figs. 1-3). Concentrations of Yemeni rock art are found in the surroundings of Sancã' and §acda, in the Haulãn and the marginal zones in or near the desert, and the transitional zone of the Eastern Highlands which slopes down to the desert. Fig. 2 - Figures from the «Oval-headed People Style» from Ša^b Abu cAšara/Central Arabia (after Anati 1968a: fig. 4). Fig. 3 - Three armed horsemen accompanied by a dog from the Wãdi Habãbid (IsMEO, Y. 83a 26 bis).</page><page sequence="4">258 Michael Jung [4] The frequent discovery of rock pictures in these regions depends on different factors: on the easy accessibility of the surroundings in the case of Sancã' and Sacda; on the intensive archaeological research of the Haulän region on behalf of the Italian Archaeological Mission; and, the greater number of rock pictures in the desert or semidesert areas 3, which were more easily noticed by travellers such as Philby (1939, 1956), Hatem al-Halidl (cf. Ryckmans 1959) and Kortler (ČervÍček &amp; Kortler 1979). Even so the general picture of the distribution of rock art sites still appears somewhat incomplete and arbitrary. Setting of Rock Pictures Rock pictures are executed mainly on sandstone and limestone. Often they are found on rocks alongside paths and caravan routes, as well as wãdls which were used as such (cf. the WãdT Habäbid, in Jung 1989: 274-81, the WãdfUs, in Jung 1990: 45-50). Particular boulders sometimes bear assemblages of pictures, and also inscriptions from different periods (cf. e.g. the site of the Gabal Šamsan/Halwet al-Dlb, see Jung 1989: 281-4, about the pictures there see also Rathjens &amp; von Wissmann 1932, 179-82, figs. 133, 134, photographs 122-6; Jamme 1976: 103-9, pls. 16,17). Favourable conditions of the rock surface itself, a curious appearance of the boulders, and the desire to imitate ancient graffiti will sometimes be the reasons for such assemblages, but also religious and magical conceptions, bound with a presumed supernatural meaning of mountains and rocks, must have been of some importance 4. Not only natural rocks, but also building stones, pillars and columns especially of pre-Islamic construction or reused pre-Islamic architectural elements served as surfaces for the rock pictures (cf. the THTR temple in Main, the Gâmic al-Kabîr al- Asfai in Asnãf, and the masgid al-Abhar in Sancã' see Jung 1989: 284 f.). 3 A great number of rock art sites of the world are concentrated in desert or semidesert areas, in «peripheral and/or isolated zones in the present ecological situation» as Anati expressed it (1984: 26). The explanations for the great density of rock art in these marginal zones or their more frequent discovery there are to my mind: 1) the favourable settings in these regions for the execution of rock pictures with many available rock surfaces not covered by earth and vegetation; 2) the better preservation of the pictures in these arid or semiarid regions in contrast to more moist regions; 3) and, the fact that rock art appears to be a characteristic expression of nomads and seminomads who inhabit these peripheral regions, cf. the short discussion in Jung a. 4 About the importance of holy mountains, rocks, boulders, Betyls etc. in Southern Arabia see Robin 1981, Pirenne 1976, 1980, see also the «rock sanctuaries» in Jung 1988: 181 f.</page><page sequence="5">[ 5 ] Rock Art of North Y emen 259 Fig. 4 - Hunting scene from the Wadi Slrr (from SERJEANT 1976: fig. frontispiece).

One can distinguish crude and fine, and direct and indirect pecking, full relief carving (cf. Gabai Qutrãn, see Activities 1983: 342, figs. 52, 53), engravings, and also, though rather seldom paintings (cf. Gabai Haid, see CervÍČEK &amp; Kortler 1979: 230, fig. 37; Gabai al-Musalhaqät/Sacda, see De Bayle des Hermens 1976: 25; 1984: 189). The figures can be depicted with outlines presenting only the contours of the subject, with partial pecking within the outlines, or with the whole interior space of the figure pecked. Fig. 6 - A scene with a snake attacking from behind a lizard from the Wadi Hababid (IsMEO Y. 83a. 36).</page><page sequence="7">[7] Rock Art of North Yemen 261 Fig. 7 - Warrior from the «Oval-headed People Style» from the Gabal Ligašir (aften Červíček &amp; Kortler 1979: fig. 34). Subjects Depicted In this summary presentation, the subjects and motifs of rock pictures are subdivided into descriptive scenes, human figures, animals, weapons, and implements, and geometric signs. The most frequent subjects are hunting scenes with ibex. These animals are usually pursued by hunters equipped with bows, daggers, lances and shields, and even with rifles in more recent graffiti (see fig. 4). Dogs sometimes accompany the hunters or chase the game alone (see fig. 5). The hunting pictures with ibex are probably sometimes connected with the «Holy Hunt» 5 known in pre-Islamic inscriptions. Men laying or standing in front 5 News of the survival up to recent times in the Hadramawt of the Holy Hunt of the</page><page sequence="8">262 Michael Jung [8] of or beside ibex or a bovid reflect perhaps also some religious ideas (cf. e.g. Radt 1971/72: fig. 17; Des Bayle des Hermens &amp; Grebenart 1980: pl. VII). Huntsmen fighting against beasts of prey or struggling with snakes present other hunting scenes. A beautiful example from the Wãdl Habãbid (cf. Jung 1989; see fig. 6) shows a lizard attacked from behind by a long snake. Battle scenes are also quite common. The most ancient examples go back to the Bronze Age and belong to the «Oval-headed People Style» (cf. fig. 7). Fig. 8 - Battle scene from the Wãdi Hababid (IsMEO Y. 83a 17). ibex has been given by Ingrams (1937). Beeston (1948), Ryckmans (1976) and Serjeant (1976) have worked on the topic of this hunt. Recently new inscriptions were found by the Italian Archaeological Mission at Šicb al-cAql, which report on a ritual hunt on the ibex by the Mukarribs YT° MR BYN and KRB'L WTR, cf. Garbini 1988 and Al-EryãnI 1988.</page><page sequence="9">[9] Rock Art of North Yemen 263 The most frequently discovered battle scenes belong to the Islamic period up to most recent times. The warriors are shown fighting on foot or on horse- or camel-back. The equipment consists of bows, daggers, lances, shields as well as rifles (cf. fig. 8). To my knowledge only in the Wad! Šaih have representations of women been found (cf. fig. 9). These depict two women with upraised our outstretched arms. With their exaggerated hips and buttocks these figures are similar to neolithic «Venus» figures, and have been interpreted as «danseuses» (Philby 1956: fig. 207a). In Central and Northern Arabia figures of women are more frequently found. Fig. 9 - Pictures of dancing women from the Wadi Šaih (after Philby 1956: fig. 207a). A motif, which finds numerous comparisons in the rock art of Central Arabia, Upper Egypt, Nubia etc. is the so-called «orant». This is a figure with outstretched and uplifted arms, and spreadout fingers (cf. fig. 10). This stance is often recognized as a praying posture. In a study a number of examples of this kind from different cultures are given (ČervÍČek 1978-79: 11) 6. Červíček 6 The same examples are quoted again in ČervÍČek-Kortler (1979: 231) in relation with Yemeni ones. It is also said that some of the latter are contemporary with armed horse- and camel-riders of a more recent date. Quite recently figures of this motif were also found in the</page><page sequence="10">264 Michael Jung [10] Fig. 10 - An «orant» with arms outstretched and large oversized hands from the Wadi Habãbid (IsMEO Y. 83a 16). supposes that these figures in Arabia and North Africa «possibly reflect Shamanic practices... [of}... the prehistoric populations of these regions». Pictures of handprints are widespread in the North Yemen (see fig. 11). Sometimes these pictures are associated with pre-Islamic inscriptions, as at the Gabal al-Falag Ganübän (Jamme 1976: 32, pl. 3) and at the Gabal cAmüd al- cAyraf (Jamme 1980: 3 If., 42-6, pls. 3, 5 and 6) 7 . Pictures of footprints are known. The animals that appear in the rock pictures indicate that similar life- conditions prevail in Southern Arabia today. I know of no species depicted that is unsuited for the actual climate and habitat. No animal is found which suggests a variation in climate and living conditions. Camels, horses, dogs and especially ibex are the most frequently shown animals, but there are also antelopes, bovids, fat-tailed sheep, leopards, hyenas, snakes, ostriches, lizards Wadi Habãbid, see fig. 10. It appears to have been distributed over great parts of the Arabian Peninsula; in addition to the quotations given by Červíček see also examples in Oman in Jäckli 1980: photographs on pp. 46f., 53-5 etc.; Preston 1976: pls. 8, 9, 13 and 15. 7 Handprints probably often had an apothropaic meaning; in the Sabaic area it has been likely a symbol of the god CTHTR, see Höfner 1965: 508f. and cf. also the handprints in Nagrän/al-Uhdüd in Bron 1970: pl. Va, and Anati 1974: figs. 309-10, 316; in Islamic times it was seen as an amulet, as that is the hand of Fatima, Muhammad or cAlT; cf.

The weapons and implements carried by hunters and warriors of the graffiti are lances and shields (for their typology cf. Jung 1990: 51), swords, daggers, bows and quivers, rifles and perhaps an axe. The representation of a single weapon such as a «Gambyyia» or a rifle (cf. in the Wãdl Habãbid, see Jung 1989: 277) can sometimes indicate a warrior or a hunter. Saddles and headgear belong to the equipment of camels and horses. One camel is carrying a litter (in the Wãdl cArayga, cf. Philby 1956: fig. 210 b). I have still to mention pictures of vessels (?), a sickle-shaped object, a tent, and a modern picture of a military tank (at al-šicab/šibam Giras, cf. JUNG 1989: pl. XXV b). Fig. 13 - Long-horned bovids from the Gabal Haid (after Červíček &amp; Kortler 1979: fig. 39). 8 For more about the depicted animals see Jung 1989, also Tchèrnov's article about the rock pictures of animals recorded by the Philby-Ryckmans-Lippens Expedition in Central Arabia, interpreted from the view-point of a zoologist (1974) and useful also for the study of Yemeni fauna.</page><page sequence="13">[13} Rock Art of North Yemen 267 The geometrie signs that have been recorded include game-boards and also designs that may have served as plans and topographical maps. Their contours are angular, rounded or irregular, and their inner spaces are subdivided into different sections. A rock panel in the WãdfUs (Jung 1990: 45-50; see fig. 14) presents circles with a central point, and disks with internal and external rays accompanied by the figure of a horseman. With reservations I interpret the graffiti of this panel as a celestial map. Fig. 14 - Geometric signs from the Wãdl cUš (IsMEO, Y. 83. 636). A great number of geometric signs such as strocks, dots, lines, squares, circles and disks are found at numerous sites (fig. 15). Some of them had already been discussed by Höfner («Magische Zeichen aus Südarabien», 1952/53) who deals also with the geometric signs of South Yemen. .Some of these signs probably represent tribal marks or «Wasms» (cf. the discussions on «Wasms» in Littmann 1904; Field 1952). Near to many of these pictures are Islamic and pre-Islamic inscriptions. Chronological Framework While admitting the still very limited knowledge about Yemeni rock art, it may appear somewhat premature to propose a chronological framework.</page><page sequence="14">268 Michael Jung [14] Fig. 15 - Geometrie signs from al-Š^ab/Šibam Giras (IsMEO, Y. 83. 1396). Documentation is full of gaps, especially for the most ancient periods: evidence emerges only occasionally, and assignments of rock pictures to definite periods are generally based on mere suppositions. In any case, the preliminary chronological chart proposed here will be surely refined through further studies in the future. At this present moment we can say that Yemeni rock pictures can be attributed to four main periods: A Neolithic ca. 6000- ca. 3000 B.C. B Bronze Age ca. 3000- ca. 1000 B.C. C Pre-Islamic ca. 1000 B.C.- 622 A.D. D Islamic 622 A.D.- present As far as I know, no rock pictures can be assigned with certainty to the hunting-gathering period (before 6000 B.C.). But rock art of this period has been found in Central Arabia, Jordan and Palestine 9, and we can suppose that its existence may be discovered in the future also in North Yemen. Evidence for Yemeni rock art begins in the Neolithic period. In De Bayle des Hermens' opinion (1976: 24) two scenes figured at the Gabal al- 9 For Central Arabia cf. Anati 1970: 153f., his «Early Hunters» Period embraces the «Schematic Rough Style», the «Deeply Engraved Style» and the «Finely Engraved Style», see also Zarins et al. 1981: 34f.; for Jordan see Rhotert 1938, and for Palestine, Anati 1956.</page><page sequence="15">[15} Rock Art of North Yemen 269 Musalhaqãt/Sacda belong to the Neolithic period. They show a hunting scene with four dogs chasing an ibex (or antelope), and a man lying in front of two of these animals. In 1983 a rock picture was discovered within the archaeological context of the aceramic Neolithic settlement of the Gabal Qutrãn (al-cAmãs) showing the above mentioned ram horns. It has been clearly dated within the Neolithic period of this site (Activities 1983: 342, fig. 52, 53). Fig. 16 - A group of ibex with long over-emphasized horns from the Gabal Šamsan (Halwet al-Dlb; IsMEO Y. 83a. 28). The rock pictures of ibex with over-emphasized horns and humpless bovids recorded by Korler during his journeys to several sites in the North and North- Eastern part of Yemen demonstrate that «in the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C., ... existed a cult of the humpless cattle and a cult of the ibex in the northern Yemen, the former of African, the latter of Asiatic origin» (CervÍČek &amp; Kortler 1979: 232). To these pictures belong perhaps also the ibex depicted at the Gabal Šamsan (Halwet al-Dlb; see fig. 16), a site about 12 km. north-northwest of Sancã' 10. The ibex of various, sizes present stylized bodies formed by a few 10 Some of the rock pictures of the Gabal Šamsan were already published by Rathjens &amp; VON WiSSMANN (1932: 179-82, figs. 133, 134, photos 122-6) and the near rock panel with the great pre-Islamic inscription (= Ja 2860) has been studied by Jamme (1976: 103-9, pls. 16, 17). In 1983 the Italian Archaeological Mission had the possibility to briefly visit the site (cf. Jung 1989).</page><page sequence="16">270 Michael Jung [16] straight lines for the trunk and the legs and over-emphasized horns. I proposed in a former article (Jung 1989: 281-4) the 1st. millennium B.C. as a terminus ante quem for these pictures. This dating is based on the considerable difference in patina between these and nearby pre-Islamic inscriptions. Similar figures of ibex have been found in the WãdT Dahr at Hagar al-Lahlb and Huqqa ben Husn (Radt 1971/72: 263-8, figs. 14-8, 22), and also at Damm al-Kãfir (Grimme 1935: pl. VI). A huge, 2m. high human figure is depicted beside a group of such ibex at Hagar al-Lahlb, and recalls a scene with a man lying in front of two ibex at the Gabal al-Musalhaqät/Sacda (De Bayle des Hermens &amp; Grebenart 180: pl. VII). The Bronze Age is presented in North Yemen through the «Oval-headed- People Style» (cf. Jung b). Pictures at six sites can probably be assigned to this style which is widely spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula. The Yemeni pictures can be connected with the Central Arabian ones which are well studied in Anati's monograph (1968a; see also Zarins 1982). Some details may be linked to neighbouring cultures thereby providing chronological clues. For example, the daggers with broad blades and with broad lunate pommels held by warriors in pictures of this style at the Gabal Haid can be compared with similar weapons of the Bronze Age cultures of Anatolia, Syria and Southern Mesopotamia (cf. ČervÍČek &amp; Kortler 1979: 321, fig. 40). These daggers are also frequently represented in the «Realistic-Dynamic Style» of the Gabal Qara area (Saudi Arabia), which is dated with the aid of these arms to the middle of the third millennium B.C. (= Anati's Middle Hunting and Pastoral Period II, cf. Anati 1968 b: 74f.; 1974: 157). The pre-Islamic Period embraces the time between the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Islamic Era. During much of this period North Yemen was under the rule of the Southern Arabian kingdoms, such as Saba, Qataban and Him jar. The same centuries are labelled by Anati as the «Literate Period» for Central Arabia which «started shortly before the spread of Southern Semitic writing and we may tentatively propose the year 1000 B.C. as its starting point» (Anati 1972: 156) n. Considering the question of the beginning of this script (cf. the different points of view in von Wissmann 1982 and Garbini 1988) it may appear more appropriate to replace the «Literate Period» with the more general term «Pre-Islamic Period». Generally rock art of this era appears to be of less importance during the phase of the Southern Arabian 11 The subdividing of the Central Arabian rock art in the following four main ages: Islamic, Literate, Hunting and Pastoral, and Early Hunters, introduced by Anati, cf. 1972: 28- 31, is used also by other scholars, cf. Courtenay-Thompson 1975: 31; Zarins et al. 1981: 34, etc.</page><page sequence="17">[17] Rock Art of North Yemen 271 kingdoms. Rather more frequent are the rock inscriptions in this period. Rock pictures, found not very far from them, can be considered to be contemporary in some cases, (cf. at the Gabal Šamsan, see Jung 1989, at the Gabal cAmüd al-cAyraf, see Jamme 1980: 3 If., 42-6, pls. 3, 5, 6; at Huqqa, see Rathjens &amp; von Wissmann 1932: 74f., 167-79). In the Islamic period rock art seems to have been practised more frequently. Figures of horsemen and camel-riders, often equipped with long lances and accompanied by Arabic inscriptions, are characteristic of this era. Representations of rifles or even a military tank occur in the more recent or modern rock pictures. Summary Our knowledge of Yemeni rock art has been summary discussed. A brief report has been given about the distribution of the sites and the settings of the rock pictures; the techniques employed, the subjects depicted and a preliminary frame work for its chronology proposed. Further studies in the future will probably correct some of the above expressed views, because we are only at the beginnings of rock art research in North Yemen.
