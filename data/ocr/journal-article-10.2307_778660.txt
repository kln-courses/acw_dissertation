<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory, the Forgetting of Modernism, the Necessity of Rhetoric, and the Conditions of Publicity in Art and Criticism STEPHEN MELVILLE Another drawback of these grand con- structions is that it is necessary to have recourse to allegory, so cold in poetry, so obscure and unbearable in painting. Fools willingly call allegory the poetry of painters; for my part, I think that nothing so testifies to an artist's lack of genius as resorting to allegory. -Friedrich Melchior Grimm, as cited by Michael Fried in Absorption and Theat- ricality, Appendix A Now I want to suggest that in the Ho- mere recitant that strategy has been car- ried further by the provision of an entire audience, from which the beholder feels himself to be excluded, listening to and presumably absorbed in Homer's recita- tion. In addition, the poet himself is depicted as aware of the presence of that audience, for which indeed he is per- forming. The position of the beholder in this regard is at once deprived and privi- leged, much like one backstage or in the wings at a theatrical production. -Michael Fried, Absorption and Theatricality, Appendix C These notes are at once scattered and ambitious: that they are scattered will no doubt pass as a sign of the pluralist times; that criticism and theory of criticism</page><page sequence="2">56 OCTOBER appear here as the site for a certain kind of intellectual ambition may strike some as more deeply problematic. Robert Pincus-Witten once feared that criticism had become sophisticated and powerful enough to crush "genuine" artistic ambition. This is nonsense (of a peculiarly critical sort)'-the deep risk for criticism is that it might crush or lose itself and that it might do so through its profoundest achievements. This is the central risk of the ambition embodied in these pages- that, as Paul de Man would have it, its insight is exactly its blindness as well. It will become apparent that these remarks are not a preliminary apology-with them we are already in midstream. Mere: A boundary; also, an object indicating a boundary, a landmark. Mere: la.

This essay takes this book as an opportunity to review an argument and a career.3 Where this can claim to be something more than a mere review, it can perhaps still be no more than an appendix to Fried's work, to Fried's appendices especially. My concern will be to explore the extent to which the formalist program is and is not still that in which we move and write and engage our issues-to explore the current condition of criticism at least; how far formalism touches the condition of art may remain an open and contested question. Allegory has come to appear for us as "the trope of tropes" 4-and my concern is then with who we are now and what it means for us to find ourselves before this appearance. Allegory has come to appear for us as the trope of tropes-and this should be astonishing. What we are inclined to forget is that for most of us allegory has been-where it has been anything at all-a term of denigration, a way of naming the merely rhetorical: the brute fact of and constraint to ornament, convention, artifice-opposed variously to the depth and integrity, spontaneity and organic holism, of metaphor and symbol. Grimm's sense of cold and boring artifice has been, by and large, our own as well: One thinks that one justifies these enormous constructions by saying that they are meant less to touch us than to arouse our admiration. But admiration is a rapid feeling, a sudden thrill that does not last and that becomes tiresome and cold as soon as one wants to prolong it. It is always produced by the simplicity and sublimity of a 67-86, and no. 13 (Summer 1980), 61-80.

The most artistically arranged brilliance soon bores and repels. This is not to mention the numerous added ornaments and inevitably out of place accessories that a composed work of a certain size entails. Grimm goes on to remark that, these reflections necessarily lead to another. It is incredible how much havoc and harm have been wrought in all the arts by imitation. Imitation alone is responsible for the audacity and success of mediocre people, the timidity of men of true genius, and the discouragement the latter feel.5 Fried appends Grimm's text to his book because of its bearing on "unity, instantaneousness, and related topics"--topics that underlie and inform Fried's central distinction between "absorption" and "theatricality." We will be turning to this material shortly, but for the time being we do well to remark, in Grimm and in ourselves, the extent to which the recognition of "mere allegory" is embedded in a larger "mere structure" which links (as if necessarily) "mere allegory," "mere ornament," and "mere imitation." "Mere rhetoric" has its place in this chain; in England "mere Protestantism" holds a place in crucial adjacency to it. I am neither historian nor scholar enough to draw this picture in detail, but some of the central nodes in the history organized by this chain-some, for example, of the literary figures on whom the risk of "mereness" most nearly and powerfully pressed-are, I think, obvious enough: Sidney (who lived through the transformation of "mere" from the praise of "pure, unmixed" to its current and derogatory sense); Milton (of course); and (closest to us perhaps) those condemned to follow and find themselves in Milton's poetic wake. In the English tradition there are a certain number of texts that seem to draw their peculiar strength from the manner in which they are intertwined with the terms of this structure: sermons by Donne and Andrewes, Swift's Tale of a Tub, Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, the career and apology of Cardinal Newman. No doubt the idea and experience of America have their place here as well. This "mere structure" is the logical concomitant of the twin (and in England simultaneous) movements of Reformation and Renascence. The risk inherent in such repetition and return to origin is that of "mere repetition" (a term to name the chain as well as figure in it). This is one way of fleshing out Stanley Cavell's skeletal characterization of modernism: The essential fact of (what I refer to as) the modern lies in the relation 5. Fried, Absorption and Theatricality, p. 164.</page><page sequence="5">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 59 between the present practice of an enterprise and the history of that enterprise, in the fact that this relation has become problematic.6 An age whose relation to its past has become problematic in this way will be led to find and guarantee itself and its work through detour and delay-works and devices of indirection, complex barriers to and recoveries of presence. Implicit here is a notion of "necessary indirectness"--a notion Cavell has explored with some delicacy in an essay on Kierkegaard. This, then, is a very particular literary problem, a problem concerning a very particular situation of language, not one.. . in which there are alternative vehicles for expressing a thought, one of which can be said to convey it directly, the other indirectly; nor ... a situation in which there is no alternative vehicle of expression for the thought and therefore no way in which it can be conveyed differently (directly or indirectly). It is one in which, while there is only one vehicle of expression, there are two thoughts it can express, and moveover the thoughts are incompatible, mutually defeating ... [The] message is of such a form that the words which contain its truth may be said in a way which defeats that very truth.7 This we have called "irony." We are being taught now to see in it "allegory" as well. Laurie Anderson speaks of the gesturing figure on Apollo 10, "Do you think they will think his hand is permanently attached that way? Or do you think they will read our signs? In our country, good-bye looks just like hello?" Craig Owens comments: Two alternatives: either the extraterrestrial recipient of this message will assume that it is simply a picture, that is, an analogical likeness of the human figure, in which case he might logically conclude that male inhabitants of Earth walk around with their right arms permanently raised. Or he will somehow divine that this gesture is addressed to him and attempt to read it, in which case he will be stymied, since a single gesture signifies both greeting and farewell, and any reading of it must oscillate between these two extremes. The same gesture could also mean "Halt!" or represent the taking of an oath, but if Anderson's text does not consider these alternatives that is because it is not concerned with ambiguity, with multiple meanings engendered by a single sign; rather, two clearly defined but mutually incompatible readings are engaged in blind confrontation in such a way that it is impossible to choose between them . .. this works to problematize the 6.

What intervenes between the one and the other, what is rediscovered between "irony" and "allegory," is just the fact and necessity of reading, of criticism. Cavell wrote of Kierkegaard, In using such words directly the relation between what one says and what there is in those words to be heard and understood is ironic, and, depending on the context and the consequences, comic or tragic.1' More recently he has had this to say (of Wittgenstein): Putting together the ideas that noticing an aspect is being struck by a physiognomy; that words present familiar physiognomies; that they can be thought of as pictures of their meaning; that words have a life and can be dead for us; that "experiencing a word" is meant to call our attention to our relation to our words; that our relation to pictures is in some respects like our relation to what they are pictures of; -I would like to say that the topic of our attachment to our words is allegorical of our attachments to ourselves and to other persons. Something of this we were prepared for. My words are my expressions of my life; I respond to the words of others as their expressions, i.e., respond not merely to what their words mean but equally to their meaning of them. I take them to mean ("imply") something in or by their words; or to be speaking ironically, etc. Of course my expressions and my responses need not be accurate." Irony slides toward allegory as it recognizes its involvement with other minds and persons-and as it does so it confuses and complicates the line between what we might otherwise want to distinguish as, for example, literature and life. When Cavell writes that "the idea of the allegory of words is that human expressions, the human figure, to be grasped, must be read," he returns us to Laurie Anderson's rumination on our attempts to communicate with extraterres- trials. And when Cavell extends his meditation, by suggesting that "the human body is the best picture of the human soul" 8. Owens, "Allegorical Impulse," part 2, pp. 60-61. 9. This is more obviously true for recent developments in literary criticism than in art, since literary criticism has for some time explicitly valorized irony as the principle of literary unity. In both regions allegory offers the possibility of moving beyond too narrow an understanding of the purity of the work. 10. Cavell, "Existentialism," p. 968. 11.

The body is the field of expression of the soul. The body is of the soul; it is the soul's; a human soul has a human body..., and when he goes on to recall Hegel's assertion that "[the] human shape [is] the sole sensuous phenomenon that is appropriate to mind," we should be recalled to "Art and Objecthood" 's terms of criticism: ... what is wrong with literalist work is not that it is anthropomorphic but that the meaning and, equally, the hiddenness of its anthropomor- phism are incurably theatrical.12 What Fried objects to in the work of Tony Smith is the way in which it offers itself to its beholder as (not simply a person but) a person who then refuses to allow one a human relation to itself-it is work that distances itself from (the subject it thereby forces to become merely) its beholder. It refuses to let itself mean-be taken as meaning; it is soulless, it enforces the condition Cavell calls "soul-blindness" on its viewer.'3 We have known people with this kind of irony-who would make us the decider of their ensouledness, who would make us decide for them the humanity of their expressions. We are not (yet) Martians to ourselves, and if it is true that hello and good- bye look just the same in our country and that there are therefore senses in which our reading of one another is forever suspended in its own uncertainty, it is also and no less true that we do in fact read each other (felicitously or no). We wave back, greeting or parting or both. (As Derrida might sometimes have it: it is a condition of the mail's going astray that it be sometimes delivered.) We stand here in any case, our arms raised to modernism, to "Art and Objecthood," to Tony Smith and Vito Acconci and Robert Smithson, Stanley Cavell and Jacques Derrida, one another. 12. Fried, "Art and Objecthood," p. 130. 13. "If it makes sense to speak of seeing human beings, then it makes sense to imagine that a human being may lack the capacity to see beings as human. It would make sense to ask whether someone may be soul-blind.... "So to speak of seeing human beings as human beings is to imply that we notice that human beings are human beings; and that seems no more acceptable than saying that we are of the opinion that they are (cf. Investigations, p. 178).-What is implied is that it is essential to knowing that something is human that we sometimes experience it as such, and sometimes do not, or fail to; that certain alterations of consciousness take place, and sometimes not, in the fact of it" (Cavell, The Claim of Reason, pp. 378-379). Our concern throughout this essay-perhaps most explicitly in the section entitled "The Truth of Allegory and the Necessity of Rhetoric"-is with the continuing and twin possibilities of soul- and art-blindness.</page><page sequence="8">62 OCTOBER The task of self-criticism became to elim- inate from the effects of each art any and every effect that might conceivably be borrowed from or by the medium of any THE DIALECTICS OF PURITY other art. Thereby each art would be rendered "pure," and in its "purity" find the guarantee of its standards of quality as well as of its independence. -Greenberg, "Modernist Painting" I have now to tell a double story, a history of purity and its vicissitudes and a history- of the critical appreciation of the complexities of that purity. Clement Greenberg's central formulation already hedges its bet. The scare- quotes set about "purity" mark a moment of hesitation, recoil, anxiety that becomes, in "Art and Objecthood," an extended unease, dividing and hiding itself between two well-separated footnotes. The first reads in part: . flatness and the delimitation of flatness ought not to be thought of as the "irreducible essence of pictorial art" but rather as something like the minimal conditions for something's being seen as a painting; and ... the crucial question is not what these minimal and, so to speak, timeless conditions are, but rather what, at a given moment, is capable of compelling conviction, of succeeding as painting. This is not to say that painting has no essence; it is to claim that that essence-i.e. that which compels conviction-is largely determined by, and therefore changes continually in response to, the vital work of the recent past. The essence of painting is not something irreducible. Rather, the task of the modernist painter is to discover those conventions that, at a given moment, alone are capable of establishing his work's identity as painting."4 In the opening Fried gives us we should pause to note just how far the diverse works of the past decade have forced this-can the work of, for example, Vito Acconci be "seen as painting"? What would it mean to see it so-and would that be different from seeing it some other way (as theater or TV or poetry)? RoseLee Goldberg (among others) has tried to present performance as its own genre, backed with its own (short) historical pedigree; how far can we be inclined to buy this? How far are we inclined to see performance as answering always to the criteria-and problems-of some other art-painting, sculpture, (real) theater? And what of earthworks and conceptual art and process art and a hundred other forms of post-Minimalist enterprise? How seriously are we to take these activities, 14. Fried, "Art and Objecthood," pp. 123-124.</page><page sequence="9">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 63 and on what terms? The questions end where Fried closes his opening on us. The truth is that the distinction between the frivolous and the serious becomes more urgent, even absolute, every day, and the enter- prises of the modernist arts more purely motivated by the felt need to perpetuate the standards and values of the high art of the past.'5 The "purity" that Fried thus surrenders with one hand is (almost) silently recovered with the other (and for those concerned with tracing the genealogy of a new allegorism it is far from irrelevant that the recuperating hand here is one concerned to fence the high and serious art of Morris Louis off from the degenerate and theatrical flatbed tableaux of Robert Rauschenberg). The uneven, stumbling rhythm at work between Fried's footnotes-the broken-legged, limping dialectic of "purity"'-is crucial to the formalist program; it is between and across purity's eclipse and recovery of itself that the work of this criticism is achieved. Its work is that of separating, impossibly, the "mere" from the "pure"; where its rhythm ceases, where the jagged hesitations of "purity" are reduced to the punctual simplicity of "that which is unique and absolutely fundamental" to every art, criticism is lost-mere purity is the forgetting of modernism (if such a forgetting and such an impulse to puritanism were not also a hallmark of what we call modernism in its double impulse to repetition and origination). But we are running ahead of ourselves here and likely to become entangled in our own legs. Michael Fried has, in support of "Art and Objecthood," a story to tell. It is the story of painting's effort to purge itself of (what it would call) the merely theatrical. It goes-schematized nearly to parody-like this: At a certain time and in a certain country, art saw-saw what? It is not easy to say what it is that we are to take it that art somehow obscurely glimpsed in its experience of and reflection on itself (it is not even clear how far this "glimpsing" is to be taken literally, how far metaphorically). -Art saw that it was seen, and it saw-in this exposure of itself to an audience, a beholder-itself at risk (at risk, then, just where it succeeds, when it succeeds). Painting came to fear that it could lose itself and that it could lose itself as if in broad daylight. Something of this fear and its difficulty is at work in the first of the two footnotes we have cited from "Art and Objecthood," leading Fried into the major complexities of: To begin with, it is not quite enough to say that a bare canvas tacked to a wall is not "necessarily" a successful picture; it would, I think, be less of an exaggeration to say that it is not conceivably one. It may be countered that future circumstances might be such as to make it a successful painting; but I would argue that, for that to happen, the 15. Ibid., p. 142.</page><page sequence="10">64 OCTOBER enterprise of painting would have to change so drastically that nothing more than the name would remain.16 "Nothing more than the name would remain": How could we-how can we-know that this has not in fact already happened? that it is not in fact happening at every instant in the history and world of painting? What if painting ("painting") is everywhere invaded by its own loss-what would we then want to say about painting, and how? Let us say, to get on with the story, that around the time of Diderot painting glimpsed a possible future in its recent and rococo past and saw that, in this future, it was-wallpaper, Muzak for the eyes, panels of vague and pleasant prettiness. What it thus saw is not without its truth. Painting is or was right to be scared; it is there only to be looked at and unless it could take control of this fact it would seem to be condemned to the merely decorative. (And then we have to note that the claim to an allegorical postmodernism is coincident with a new valoriza- tion of the decorative impulse and of pattern painting-these two movements can then appear to be the same, as any modernism and literalism can appear to be the same.) Painting saw, in its experience of itself, something obscure, barely palpable, and dangerous-something about how it might lose itself. It could, of course, have been wrong (we all make mistakes). The history Fried has worked through would then reduce to an unfortunate error, a prolonged moment of overreaction to the Enlightenment and its rationalist "put up or shut up." Postmodernism would then name painting's recovery from its long night of anxiety-much, perhaps, as literary modernism sought to understand itself as the recovery of a certain poetry from its dark night of dissociation and groundless fear. On such a view, painting will have always been secure in itself, its essential core safely buried inside itself all along, authenticating the work that continued to count and discounting the rest. This view reads "purity" as "that which is unique and absolutely fundamental" to each art. It assumes that "radical self-criticism" is the name of a certain test imposed by and in reaction to the "rational criticism" of the Enlightenment-a test that religion, for example, is taken to have failed, but which painting, in its (re)discovery of flatness will pass. It is the arid formalism against which so many artists and critics claimed to be reacting in the late sixties and the seventies; it is what we keep claiming to be beyond or outside. That this sort of formalism is stifling and absurdly restrictive goes now without saying. But we still need to understand how it could ever have been a powerful guide to and for painting-what power we may be passing over in our anxiety for the recovery of a new beyond. We need to grasp the historical rhythm and complexity opened by the notion of purity before it subsided into the truth of 16. Ibid., p. 123.</page><page sequence="11">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 65 painting (as we will need to grasp the rhythm of allegory before it too subsides into its own truth). This is where Fried's work over the past decade counts profoundly. His deep story-as against the apparent tale in Greenberg-is not that of the truth of painting, but rather that of painting's continuing effort to recover itself through and across its denials and evasions of its necessary conditions. The story is dialectically charged, but is, in principle at least, not submitted to the authority of any Absolute. At the same time, it is a story that cannot be told except through the postulation of some Absolute somewhere. It would be radically existential, having us see how painting makes itself, but it cannot avoid having somewhere to assume a fixable-made-self. It is an account that, in its essence, is open to attack and controversy-but attacks that cannot reach at least as far as this inner openness to controversy will be without interest for it. How, then, does the story go? Painting realized a certain possibility of loss of itself in the face of its presence to a beholder and undertook to expel that possibility from itself by refusing that very fact. The history begins with a denial of "the primordial convention that paintings are made to be beheld,"17 and, as with any such denial, time tells of its failures, its inevitable betrayals of itself: one can, for example, deny the fact and fear of castration-but at the expense of the sanity of one's little finger. Painting's little finger is its relation to theater and theatrical performance. This relation would be one of mere and mutual externality-two arts each organized around its own rational core. The only problem they face would be a certain tendency to confusion, a confusion to which adequate vigilance could put a stop. For painting, "theater" would be the name of a central failure-a failure that remains within the general sphere of the aesthetic and forecloses the possibility of any radical fall out of art altogether. The risk is not that the work might be taken for wallpaper but that its tableau might be misinterpreted as theatrical-might be taken to demand rather than to deny or absorb its beholder. The category of "theatricality" conceals and constrains a crossing between questions about whether something is art and about whether it is good art; this is part of what it means to write, as Fried does, that "what lies between the arts is theatre."18 Out of this nest of fictions, displacements, and deferrals, painting constructs for itself a project that can appear as one of rational self-criticism: the task of painting will be to cut itself off everywhere from the merely theatrical- everywhere exclude from itself that which continues to pose the persistence of an exterior beholder-and so work always toward that in itself which is capable of absorbing its viewer. 17. See Fried, Absorption and Theatricality, p. 93. 18. Fried, "Art and Objecthood," p. 142.</page><page sequence="12">66 OCTOBER As this project unfolds in time, it will necessarily have the character of a series of reinterpretations of the meaning of "absorption" as each given grasp of it falls before the inevitable and ineluctable fact of the beholder. The beholder, always there, gazing, is the silent motor that drives the history of modern painting forward, forcing it to find behind its ever more radical claims to absorption always the same brute fact of theater. The details of this history are the critic's work, and I cannot pretend to do any justice to (let alone evaluate) Fried's analyses and readings. It is important, however, that we have some feel for the overall shape and logic of the story. The project of absorptive painting begins, as if naturally, from the painterly idea that the most absorptive works are those that present absorption itself. This idea is itself open to a variety of realizations-sleep can appear as a paradigmati- cally absorbed state, but so also can states of waking reverie, or intense concentra- tion, or deep emotion. What appears when as an adequate vehicle for this thematic approach to the project of absorbing the viewer will depend very much on what has appeared when and how it appeared then. -Can still life be a vehicle for absorptive painting? In principle anything can appear as such a vehicle, but only when it does (and when it does it will appear as an argument for its own necessity). The constraints are existential and historical. Now (and here we collapse a complex history that is properly articulated only through the paintings that embody it into a single and ridiculous chain of tortured conditionals): if the representation of action, crucial action in particular, comes to seem an adequate vehicle for absorptive painting, then history painting (of a certain kind) will become a privileged genre; and if history painting becomes so privileged in a country whose political history is prone to pose itself more or less explicitly as a repetition of an earlier history (as the French the Roman), then that history painting will be, at least implicitly and so finally explicitly, a political painting as well, so that at a certain point it will have "Frenchness" as an issue internal to the project of painting itself and determining the history of absorptive painting as having been all along a history essentially "French," thus encourag- ing the posing of the problem of authoritative painting as a problem of breaking out of "Frenchness" and regaining contact with the greatness of (what now appears as) European painting: so that at various points on the road to what appears in America in the mid-twentieth century as a formalist art and criticism the terms in which painting will have counted and will demand to be appreciated will vary from the thematic to the political to the art historical.'9 With respect to this history we can say either that "formalism" names only one, relatively late moment within it, or that "formalism," properly understood, entails a critical responsiveness to the way in which painting poses itself in itself and for itself in 19. The focus on "Frenchness" in this paragraph is derived primarily from "Manet's Sources"; the reader may also wish to consult the essays on Couture and Courbet.</page><page sequence="13">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 67 each given instance. "Form" and "medium" are correlatives, and if, as Cavell writes, "the medium is to be discovered or invented out of itself,"20 "formalist" criticism is a criticism that must always rediscover and reinvent itself out of the work it considers. Another feature of our history: inscribed within its initial logic is a moment in which the painter will come to realize that he stands himself as beholder to his own work (here we touch on the problematic metaphoricity of the claim that "painting sees.. .") and that the work will then inevitably remain theatrical unless it can come to absorb him as well-a moment of radical narcissism, self- portraiture, that marks also a shift from a thematic grasp of absorption to a more formal one.21 There may well be ways in which we will want to see in much performance work a belated renewal and repetition of this moment; Courbet and Acconci may meet in an insistence that the empirical self, the artist's self, is not exempt from the notion of "radical self-criticism." (What Acconci gazing at his own body has to do with a history that assumes "painting sees.... ") Another feature: the history we have recounted is organized by its radical determination to maintain the fiction that painting is not submitted to a beholder and is related to the theater only externally and, as it were, accidentally. Sooner or later, there will be a corner to be turned-the corner of no longer trying to turn the corner into purely absorptive painting. For Fried, Manet is this corner-the point at which painting accepts the internality and inevitability of its relation to theater, acknowledges its own theatricality. Henceforth, paintings that continue to insist on the kind of abstract purity underlying the (traditional) project of absorption will now appear as irrecuperably theatrical, and paintings that explicitly pose (and master) their own theatricality become capable of exercising the claim upon our attention that "absorption" had meant to name. This, of course, looks like the dialectical overcoming of Diderot's opposition--except that what "theatricality" has been naming all along is the inevitability of distance-between painting and its viewer at first, but now a distance acknowledged as internal to painting itself- which will always keep painting from the sort of radical coincidence with itself promised by dialectical closure. Painting continues to engage itself in, as it were, midair, held by its own bootstraps between theatricality and absorption, wall- paper and the Absolute. Painting prolongs itself as it purloins itself from itself: the punning is Derridean, and the formulation intends to recall the radical complications Derrida imposes upon any history or story that would claim to deliver its message to its proper receiver (stories too obviously built around a message they would deliver we frequently recognize as allegories). From David to Couture to Courbet to Manet and on down to the controver- sies of the sixties, painting is submitted to an impulse to purity-to presentness- 20. Cavell, Must We Mean, p. 221. 21. These remarks are derived primarily from "The Beholder in Courbet."</page><page sequence="14">68 OCTOBER and to the transgression or critique of that impulse-and so also is criticism: neither within painting nor within criticism nor within the relation of the one to the other do purity and impurity exclude one another simply. ... it seems clear that starting around the middle of the eighteenth century in France the beholder's presence before the painting came increasingly to be con- THREE OR FOUR MUSEUMS ceived by critics and theorists as some- thing that had to be accomplished or at least powerfully affirmed by the painting itself; and more generally that the exis- tence of the beholder, which is to say the primordial convention that paintings are made to be beheld, emerged as prob- lematic for painting as never before. -Fried, Absorption and Theatricality From Fried's account, we can envision Diderot as imposing upon painting a simple test-a test of its "stopping power," its ability to transfix and absorb in an instant its beholder. The application of this test-by, for example, a stroll through the salon-would end by distinguishing two groups of paintings; the successful- absorbing-paintings could then be gathered up and hung elsewhere where they would, together, figure as so many examples of, simultaneously, art and good art, painting and good painting-a simple and perfect museum. This imaginary museum is, however, given the lie by the corruptions of time; nothing is more merely theatrical than yesterday's high and absorbing drama. Greuze gives way to David who gives way to Courbet. ... The shows must be changed ever faster and the very walls of the museum become unstable. The museum/salon is supplanted, in this imaginary history, by the museum/encyclopedia-Manet's museum, as well as Flaubert's22-a museum that is organized as a bulwark against time and its undoing of power. It is a museum that would recover and maintain an openness to "the great art of the past," protecting painting from the provinciality of the moment and the region, offering painting (to) the European tradition (a museum that cannot take kindly to the intrusion of geological time and site). The museum/salon argued nothing. Its license was, radically, the experi- ence of paintings, and in each case the experience of presentness was sufficient justification for the work. Time existed in this museum only to the accidental 22. Here I simply want to register the explicit crossing of my museums with the museum discussed by Douglas Crimp in "On the Museum's Ruins"; my imaginings embroider here on his.</page><page sequence="15">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 69 extent that one had to get one's beholding self from moment of presentness to moment of presentness. The museum/encyclopedia would acknowledge the facts of time and master them (the "facts of time" are here a new name for the "primordial convention that paintings exist to be beheld"). Individual paintings surrender their claim to the simplicity of presence, taking instead their place within a tradition of painting, unfolding in time, through which all claims to presentness are mediated, either implicitly (in, for example, our attempts to recall the vanished power of Greuze) or explicitly (in, for example, Manet's work). In the latter instance, we see that the explicit recovery of time in and for painting is also its explicit acknowledgment of the inevitable theatricality of painting, in itself and in its relation to the past. We will be inclined to condemn as merely-that is, disguisedly-theatrical those works that do not take on time for themselves, but rather leave it in the hands of the viewer, to shape as he or she sees most fit: ... the experience (of literalist art) persists in time, and the present- ment of endlessness that, I have been claiming, is central to literalist art and theory is essentially a presentment of endless, or indefinite dura- tion.... The literalist preoccupation with time-more precisely, with the duration of the experience-is, I suggest, paradigmatically theatri- cal: as though theatre confronts the beholder, and thereby isolates him, with the endlessness not just of objecthood but of time; or as though the sense which, at bottom, theatre addresses is a sense of temporality, of time both passing and to come, simultaneously approaching and receding, as if apprehended in an infinite perspective. ... This preoccu- pation marks a profound difference between literalist work and mod- ernist painting and sculpture. It is as though one's experience of the latter has no duration-not because one in fact experiences a picture by Noland or Olitski ... in no time at all, but because at every moment the work itself is wholly manifest.23 The museum/encyclopedia has time as a problem, recognizing that the corruptions to which the museum/salon was exposed were not accidental: a theater was always there in advance of the drama of the moment-how else could we have recognized it as drama? Diderot's criticism as it is unfolded by Fried makes a knot of time and theater such that the prospect of absorptive painting emerges between the past (and present) theatricality of the stage and the future possibility of that stage renewed by its discovery of the real drama bodied forth in successful painting. The "tableau" is the difficult seam here between the canvas and the stage. The museum/encyclopedia would exist without contradiction, at once guaranteeing and guaranteed by the Tradition. The visitor could then walk easily 23. Fried, "Art and Objecthood," pp. 144-145.</page><page sequence="16">70 OCTOBER from painting to painting, recovering each from each, experiencing newly not only the works on the wall but also the space between, the space of art history, the sense and appreciation of painting. There is in such a museum no deep scandal- no outrage history cannot place and heal, place at heel. "Art and Objecthood" and its attendant controversies might be said to mark the end of this dream of a museum. It rides uneasily its contradictions and those of the history it would close, protect, and finally guarantee. It rests uneasily as well within its understanding of itself as criticism. "Art and Objecthood" figures for us here as an attempt to defend the adequacy and integrity of the museum/encyclopedia-an attempt to show that the coincidence of art and good art can be maintained. We might say that the museum/encyclopedia has for its internal threat what appears as the "institu- tional theory of art"-the idea, most simply, that the museum means nothing, that art is nothing more than what makes it into the museum and that the appearance of the museum as at once guaranteeing and guaranteed by the history of art is simply and finally empty. Institutional theories would have us believe that there is nothing radically scandalous in art or its history-not because of the way art builds itself in and out of its history, but because the museum can absorb anything (Fountain is the proof). Against such a theory, the museum/encyclope- dia proves itself through the historically and systematically grounded exclusion of that which is irredeemably theatrical: the scandal of Tony Smith or Donald Judd or Robert Rauschenberg. The claim has now been advanced that we live in and on the ruins of this museum-in and on the failure of its exclusions-in the wake of "Art and Objecthood."24 I suggest that we should recognize in these ruins what we have come to call "the artworld"-a complex and contradictory network of (among other things and persons) museums, galleries, alternative spaces, sites, nonsites- arenas of various and mutual exclusions. This "artworld" is, in a sense, the artworld of the institutional theorist, but brought down to earth and stripped of its simplicity and homogeneity-so that if at one level this artworld as a whole is capable of absorbing all the scandals with which it is presented, it can do so only by absorbing them as scandals, by taking internal controversy and radical dissension as proper to itself. To appreciate a work in this new "museum" is with a new explicitness to map its world, and to do so partially with prejudice. What is surrendered or radically transformed in the passage from muse- um/encyclopedia to artworld is any faith in the homogeneity, simplicity, or univocity of art history: the scene is ineradicably plural. It it also and explicitly a scene-an acknowledgment of just how deeply and 24. Crimp all but makes explicit the connection between the museum and the problematic of "Art and Objecthood" in his attempt to relate Rauschenberg and Manet through Fried's essay on Manet's sources; see "On the Museum's Ruins," p. 45.</page><page sequence="17">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 71 pervasively we are submitted to theater and theatricality. The emergence of the artworld marks an invasion of the museum, of art history and art criticism, by the very terms, problems, and crises it would more externally survey. This is what Smithson early and polemically picked out as the difficulty with "Art and Objecthood": Michael Fried has ... declared a "war" on what he quixotically calls "theatricality." In a manner worthy of the most fanatical puritan, he provides the artworld with a long-overdue spectacle .... Fried has set the critical stage for manneristic modernism. . ... What Fried fears most is the consciousness of what he is doing-namely being himself theatrical.25 But it is important to see that Fried could not have said what had to be said except by exposing himself to just this charge. "Art and Objecthood" can accomplish its critical work only by posing a crisis for criticism to which it is not, by itself, adequate. The core of the issue has been brought out by Stanley Cavell: There are no such proofs possible for the assertion that the art accepted by a public is fraudulent; the artist himself may not know; and the critic may be shown up, not merely as incompetent, nor unjust in accusing the wrong man, but as taking others in (or out); that is, as an imposter ... He is part detective, part lawyer, part judge, in a country in which crimes and deeds of glory look alike, and in which the public not only, therefore, confuses the one with the other, but does not know that one or the other has been committed; not because the news has not got out, but because what counts as the one or the other cannot be defined until it happens; and when it has happened there is no sure way he can get the news out; and no way at all without risking something like a glory or a crime of his own.26 In this light, Smithson's attack seems accurate, but also too easy. If "Art and Objecthood" is significantly a piece of theatrical criticism, we are going to want to say also that "absorption" and "theatricality" end not as concepts recovered from and on behalf of the history of art and criticism, but as means to the staging of (a certain) history of modern art-devices of visibility and articulation, but also devices of invisibility and silence. What makes Smithson's attack too easy is his sense that in calling Fried "theatrical" he has managed to put him aside-in just 25. Robert Smithson, in Nancy Holt, ed., The Writings of Robert Smithson, New York, New York University, 1979, p. 38. 26. Cavell, Must We Mean, pp. 190-191. Crimes and deeds of glory look alike, I want to say, in much the same way hello and good-bye look alike, and differ in much the same way; for Fried, "the same developments" differ as they are seen theatrically or not (see "Art and Objecthood," p. 136). This play of identity and difference is at the heart of allegorical double vision.</page><page sequence="18">72 OCTOBER the way Fried put Tony Smith aside. But of course Fried was "wrong," and so also was Smithson. We are no more free to walk away from the complications imposed on criticism by an acknowledgment of its theatricality than Fried is to walk away from the complications imposed on the history of art by the persistence of a Smith or a Rauschenberg. In each instance the stake is something that would proclaim itself in some sense "postmodern." Brecht calls for new relations between an actor and his role, and between the actor and his audience: theater is to defeat theater. But in Beckett there is no role towards which the actor can maintain intelligence, and he has nothing more to tell his audience than his characters' words convey. Theater becomes the brute OFTHE IMPOSSIBILITY words convey. Theater becomes the brute OF THEATER metaphysical fact of separateness; dam- nation lies not in a particular form of theater, but in theatricality as such. If against that awareness, theater were to defeat theater, then while theater loses, it thereby wins; we have not found our way outside, we have merely extended the walls. -Cavell, "Ending the Waiting Game" What is "theatricality"? Like "absorption," it is a term caught up in a dialectic that everywhere redefines and transforms it-and it is so because it is, like "absorption," impossible. "Theater" is what pure painting would exclude from itself-what it thus fails to exclude and is, in the end, obliged to acknowledge as its inward capacity to go always astray from itself (we could even say: to be always astray from itself). But, as Fried reads Diderot, this very theater can be divided against itself, sorted out into the merely theatrical and the truly dramatic. The stage-to name the neutral thing on which the dialectic both breaks and rests-shows forth not only the threat to or failure of painting, but also that which is most powerful and absorbing in it: The recognition that the art of painting was inescapably addressed to an audience that must be gathered corresponds to the exactly concur- rent recognition that the theater's audience was a gathering not simply of auditors but of beholders ... in both cases the problems were to be resolved by the instrumentality of the tableau, whose significance for</page><page sequence="19">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 73 each art was in a sense complementary to its sense for the other.27 For Diderot, if theater names the dumping ground of painterly failure, painting reserves the right to name the success of theater: this is the source of the "complementarity" Fried finds in the twin valorizations of the tableau. A theater of the tableau would be, for Diderot, a theater purged of theatricality-a pure theater such as exists nowhere and such as could come into existence only at its own cost, unable to recognize itself. A certain impossibility of theater fandergirds what Fried presents as Diderot's "Supreme Fiction"-and we will see that if there has been something (in art, in criticism) like a turn from the modern to the postmodern, that turn has taken place within the shelter of this impossibility. Fried writes: Diderot's advocacy of tableaux as opposed to coups de thedtre is to be understood chiefly in this light. "Un incident imprevu qui se passe en action, et qui change subitement I' tat des personnages, est un coup de th~atre," he writes in the Entretiens. "Une disposition de ces personnages sur la scene, si naturelle et si vraie que, rendue fiddlement par un peintre, elle me plairait sur la toile, est un tableau." . A tableau was visible, it could be said to exist at all, only from the beholder's point of view. But precisely because this was so, it helped to persuade the beholder that the actors themselves were unconscious of his presence. Diderot's use of the term thb&amp;tre in this connection reveals the depth of his revulsion against the conventions then prevailing in the dramatic arts. But it also suggests that he despaired that those conven- tions, and the consciousness of the beholder they embodied, would ever be fully overcome for once and for all. . . . Presumably Diderot felt that if the theater were to be reformed along the lines proposed in the Entretiens and the Discourse, painters would be able to look to the stage for inspiration without dooming themselves to mediocrity or worse. But he continued to express his distaste for the theater as he knew it and in his writings on painting used the term le thbdtral, the theatrical, implying consciousness of being beheld, as synonymous with falseness.21 It is important to see in such passages how profoundly complicated the nego- tiations between theater and painting have become-how deeply purity and 27. Fried, Absorption and Theatricality, p. 93. 28. Ibid., pp. 95, 100. Fried translates: "An unexpected incident that happens in the course of the action and that suddenly changes the situation of the characters on the stage, so natural and so true to life that, faithfully rendered by a painter, it would please me on canvas, is a tableau."</page><page sequence="20">74 OCTOBER impossibility, achievement and failure, have become entangled with one another-and how the tableau emerges as the lie that binds. It is just here that we want to cite Craig Owens on the roots of Robert Wilson's theater-and we do so in order to see both what is powerful in its insight and what it too easily passes over: As I have written elsewhere, Wilson is indeed Artaud's heir, but the priority he assigns to visual imagery over written text aligns his work more with the history of recent art than with that of theater or, rather, points to a crucial link between the two-the tableau. In French, of course, "tableau" signifies both a painting and a theatrical scene; this semantic overlap is not without its consequences for both arts, as Roland Barthes observes: "As is well known, the whole of Diderot's aesthetic rests on the identification of theatrical scene and pictorial tableau: the perfect play is a succession of tableaux, that is, a gallery, an exhibition." This link between painting and theater was, however, suppressed with the ascendancy of modernism in the arts. Brecht was the last theatrical artist to conceive his works as successions of tableaux, and modernist painters in their single-minded pursuit of medium-specificity, have sought to distinguish their art from other arts, theater in particular. Thus Michael Fried, in his famous 1967 attack on Minimalism, "Art and Objecthood," could claim with impunity that "art degenerates as it approaches the condition of theater"-a pro- nouncement which, in the late 60s, gave rise to a storm of controversy over theatricality in art. It was into this polemical atmosphere that Wilson, who had studied painting with George McNeil and taken a degree in architecture at Pratt, emerged. In works like Deafman Glance (1971) and The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin (1973) he unequivo- cally identified the tableau as the meeting ground of painting and theater.?9 If this statement appears both powerful and powerfully problematic, it is because we are now able to read an essay like "Art and Objecthood" with a much greater awareness of its internal complexity and historical depth. What should interest us is that the closer we get to what we mean or want to mean by "postmodernism" the closer we also get to the heart of Fried's critical and historical project. A summary statement from the end of "Toward a Supreme Fiction" points to the final, metaphysical stakes of this project: As we have seen, the recognition that paintings are made to be beheld and therefore presuppose the existence of a beholder led to the demand for the actualization of his presence: a painting, it was insisted, had to attract the beholder, to stop him in front of itself, and to hold him there 29. Owens, "Robert Wilson: Tableaux," p. 115.</page><page sequence="21">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 75 in a perfect trance of involvement. At the same time ... it was only by negating the beholder's presence that this could be achieved; only by establishing the fiction of his absence or nonexistence could his actual placement before and enthrallment by the painting be secured. This paradox directs attention to the problematic character not only of the painting-beholder relationship but of something still more fundamental-the object-beholder (one is tempted to say object- "subject") relationship which the painting-beholder relationship epitomizes. In Diderot's writings on painting and drama the object- beholder relationship as such, the very condition of spectatordom, stands indicted as theatrical, a medium of dislocation and estrangement rather than of absorption, sympathy, self-transcendence; and the suc- cess of both arts, in fact their continued functioning as major expres- sions of the human spirit, are held to depend upon whether or not painter and dramatist are able to undo that state of affairs, to de- theatricalize beholding and so make it once again a mode of access to truth and conviction .... What is called for, in other words, is at one and the same time the creation of a new sort of object-the fully realized tableau-and the constitution of a new sort of beholder-a new "subject"-whose innermost nature would consist precisely in the conviction of his absence from the scene of representation.30 Diderot's dream, Fried's dream, is finally of a world to which we can be simply present and in which we can be simply present to one another, undivided and unposed, graceful. These are dreams about the possibility at once of commu- nity and integrity. And here we have to say that if theater and painting are two separate arts in search of their individual, pure, and detheatricalized selves, it is no longer clear that or how they are separate-even as it remains clear that there is no overcoming of their individualities. Their intercourse is complex. As they name in each other their various perils and promises, they show themselves to be so entangled that there cannot but come a time in which painting (for example) will have to recognize its theatricality not only as risk inherent in its still proper "inside," but as an "exterior" entanglement as well: the path of painting will inevitably cross that of a really existing theater (as my path crosses yours). Radical self-criticism cannot stop short of acting itself out on the occasion of and in terms of empirical selves (even if this is not its real achievement). So also the painterly acknowledgment of theatricality has, at its limits, an interest in theater as such-and especially in that theater most deeply engaged in its own self- criticism-a theater caught up in-confused and torn by-the demand for detheatricalization precisely insofar as that demand is at once means and barrier to the realization of theater: a theater that would then ground itself on the display of 30. Fried, Absorption and Theatricality, pp. 103-104.</page><page sequence="22">76 OCTOBER its own impossibility; a theater that would show itself in and through the failure of theatricality, its inability to count as theater; Artaud's theater perhaps-an impossible theater that counts for painting in a way no other theater can. In an essay on "the theater of cruelty and the closure of representation," Jacques Derrida writes: Perhaps we can now ask, not about the conditions under which a modern theater would be faithful to Artaud, but in what cases it surely is unfaithful to him. What might the themes of infidelity be, even among those who invoke Artaud in the militant and noisy fashion we all know? We will content ourselves with naming those themes. Without a doubt, foreign to the theater of cruelty are: 1. All non-sacred theater. 2. All theater that privileges speech or rather the verb, all theater of words ... 3. All abstract theater which excludes something from the totality of art, and thus, from the totality of life and its resources of significa- tion: dance, music, volume, depth of plasticity, visible images, sonor- ity, phonicity, etc.... 4. All theater of alienation .. . [Derrida's gloss touches Diderot and is worth noting: "There is no longer spectator or spectacle, but festival. All the limits furrowing classical theatricality . . . were ethico- metaphysical prohibitions, wrinkles, grimaces, rictuses-the symptoms of fear before the dangers of festival."] 5. All non-political theater... 6. All ideological theater, all cultural theater, all communicative, interpretive . . . theater seeking to transmit a content, or to deliver a message . . . that would make a discourse's meaning intelligible for its listeners; a message that would not be totally exhausted in the act and present tense of the stage, that would not coincide with the stage, that would not be repeated without it."1 Artaud too dreams the dream of presence. What real theater could exist within the limits of this dream? Derrida remarks that "Artaud kept himself as close as possible to the limit: the possibility and impossibility of pure theater." To the extent that Artaud committed himself wholly to such purity, the theater of cruelty exists only as the theory of its own impossibility, with neither instance nor legacy. 31.

From this pure incest there is no issue: And now I am going to say something which, perhaps is going to stupefy many people. I am the enemy of theater. I have always been. As much as I love the theater, I am, for this very reason, equally its enemy.32 The uneven dialectic of "purity" is at work in these lines-even in their shape-so that even as Artaud would choke off the possibility of theater alto- gether, he reopens it once again. The possibility of (what would be) a pure theater is, in effect, recovered across the admission of its impurity: the theater of cruelty (re)appears as a theater always already torn from itself, and as a theater whose cruelty is first of all a cruelty toward itself-a measure of its division from itself. Derrida writes: "Presence, in order to be presence and self-presence, has always already begun to represent itself, has always already been penetrated. "33 The scene of representation persists. Call this a theater of images-a theater that cannot be a theater, that must be counted elsewhere. If we can say convincingly (and we can) that "Wilson is indeed Artaud's heir," this is in large measure because both are joint heirs to a much more complex and divided legacy-a legacy the testamentary conditions of which are tangled by incest and cross-marriage, bizarre codicils and intervening deaths and disappearances (a legacy coincident with real history) to the point that it will never emerge from probate (not, at least, until its resources and those of its contestants are spent). Within this legacy there are terms under which theater, in its impossibility, can appear for painting-count for painting-in a way that it cannot for itself. (And in this play between the arts, the notion of audience and of beholder takes on a new depth of complication.) The tableau is the seam along which modern theater and painting have been historically bound to one another. The undoing of this seam would presumably free painting from the threat of theatricality; but this would also release painting from itself, from its possibility of achievement. We recognize Wilson's theater as relevant to the current situation of painting to the extent that it appears to us as a 32. Cited by Derrida, Writing and Difference, p. 249. 33. Derrida, Writing and Difference, p. 248.</page><page sequence="24">78 OCTOBER theater of tableaux-a theater willing to find itself within a certain complex non- presence to itself. Such a theater, appearing for an audience given (whether it will it or no) to finding itself in the wake of "Art and Objecthood," appears to decenter or deconstruct the play of mere presence and pure presentness through which Fried would have excluded the radical theater of Minimalist literalism. The slippage between his two terms-a slippage Fried implicitly claims to control, to be able to sort adequately into an experience of theater and a counterpoised experience of grace-this slippage now appears as deeply internal to this theater of images (so that what is perhaps being undone or rethought is the mythology of presence and presentness, transcendence and temporality, that underlay both sides of the earlier controversy-a present already penetrated by something other will find itself neither in a moment of grace nor in the experience of duration). Wilson's theater would make allegorists of us-and would do so whether we interest ourselves in it as painters or as critics; allegory has always been a mode of both reading and writing, creation and criticism inextricably mixed. The paint- erly claim to the recovery of allegory unfolds into the situation of criticism as well. (But then every event in the history of painting Fried recounts rebounds upon and determines its criticism-what is new then is just the way this connection is displayed for [even forced upon] us now, the way in which criticism is newly called upon to acknowledge its relation to the work that is its occasion. It may be that we needed a rediscovery of allegory in order to see that Fried has been saying this all along.) The new dificulty which comes to light in the modernist situation is that of maintaining one's belief in one's own HOW THINGS SEAM enterprise, for the past and the present become problematic together. I believe that philosophy shares the modernist difficulty now everywhere evident in the major arts, the difficulty of making one's present effort become a part of the pres- ent history of the enterprise to which one has committed one's mind, such as it is. (Modernizers, bent merely on newness, do not have history as a problem, that is, as a commitment...) -Cavell, Foreword to Must We Mean What We Say? "There is no there for you, where objects are.

The others do not vanish when a given case fails me. My experience continues to affix its seam. -Cavell, The Claim of Reason The claim we are considering is that "over the past decade we have witnessed a radical break with the modernist tradition, effected precisely by a preoccupation with the 'theatrical.' "34 On this account, the break with modernism has been effected through a shattering of the "integrity of modernist painting and sculp- ture" which makes it "clear that the actual characteristics of the medium, per se, cannot any longer tell us much about an artist's activity." This obliteration of boundaries has opened art's way to theater and its privileged experience of temporality. This is, very generally, the picture we have assumed and complicated throughout these notes. We do well to note not only that Fried's criterion of "seriousness" continues to preside over this development, but also that the claim made by Crimp on behalf of the new "aesthetic activities" that transcend or confuse media-the claim that these activities free us from a literal construal of the notion of medium-repeats exactly Fried's distinction of himself from Greenberg in the passage cited from "Art and Objecthood" at the very beginning of this essay. This should lead us to keep an eye on the peregrinations of the-literal in Crimp's summary of the current situation: An art whose strategies are thus grounded in the literal temporal- ity and presence of theater has been the crucial formulating experience for a group of artists currently beginning to exhibit in New York. The extent to which this experience fully pervades their work is not, however, immediately apparent, for its theatrical dimensions have been transformed, and, quite unexpectedly, reinvested in the pictorial image. If many of these artists can be said to have been apprenticed in the field of performance as it issued from minimalism, they have nevertheless begun to reverse its priorities, making of the literal situation and duration of the performed event a tableau whose presence and tempor- ality are utterly psychologized; performance becomes just one of a number of ways of "staging" a picture.35 34. Crimp, "Pictures," p. 76, as also the quoted phrases in the next sentence. 35. Ibid., p. 77.</page><page sequence="26">80 OCTOBER One can be tempted to name this passage "Fried's Revenge." Perhaps even "Greenberg's Revenge." (Who put the scare-quotes on "staging" and to what effect? It happens in families that members are disinherited or otherwise excluded, and that children born to such members are nonetheless acknowledged and welcomed back into the bosom of the larger family.) Michael Fried's writing is, in any case, interesting now in a way that it may not have seemed to have been for the past ten years or so. Its claim upon our attention has been renewed and it has been renewed by picturing's recovery of itself from the theatrical. As Crimp's paragraph continues, we should remark not only the presence of Artaud (in the wings as it were), but also the persistence of a problematic of beholding behind the phrase "conditions of intelligibility." Thus the performances of Jack Goldstein do not, as had usually been the case, involve an artist's performing the work, but rather the presentation of an event in such a manner and at such a distance that it is apprehended as representation--representation not, however, con- ceived as the re-presentation of that which is prior, but as the unavoid- able condition of intelligibility of even that which is present. It is this presentation of representation, this insistence on surrendering presence-of any kind-to its permeation by something other than itself, that lies at the heart of what is now being called "allegory." "Postmodernism"-insofar as it is characterized by its allegorical impulse- represents the freeing of painting from its prison of opticality as well as its recovery of subject matter beyond itself and the logic of its medium. But we do well to see how small a liberation this is. If it is true that the past fifteen or twenty years have seen the hegemony of the optical dismantled, it is still true also that "paintings are made to be beheld"-"opticality" is but one name for, interpreta- tion of, this "primordial convention" (just as the literal construal of the medium is but one construal among others of the medium of painting). We cast "postmodernism" at a deeper level if we say that the allegorical impulse is one which would acknowledge explicitly the futility of trying to sort the "mere" from the "pure"-an impulse to embrace the heteronomy of paint- ing.36 Such an acknowledgment demands that we accept-as best we can-that the field we call "painting" includes, and cannot now be defined without reference to, its violations and excesses-performance work in particular. (Performance continues then to lie between the arts and has always to be asked what it counts 36. But there is a knot here. For us the major theorist of the heteronomous and heterological is, of course, Derrida. And Joel Fineman is quite right to say that "Derrida's project is effectively to aIIpply Heidegger's critique of Western metaphysics to Heidegger himself,"'' and that there is in this insistence something of an "ever-vigilant, vaguely messianic, deconstructive Puritanism' (Fineman, "I'lhe Significance of Literature: The Importance of Being Earnest," October, no. 15 [Wintce 1980], 81). Heteronomy and purity are, as it were, in each other's service; neither escapes or stands apart from the other. Purity and its quotation marks together are essential to what we mean by modetrnism.</page><page sequence="27">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 81 as-for whom it counts. We will want to say-in this context at least-that performance is not [yet] an art in itself, but a way in which various arts may find themselves outside themselves. It is not clear to me what it would take for performance to establish itself as an art-what, that is, its "proper" medium is. The undeniable fact that performance has established itself as an artistic practice, even a central practice, tells us nothing about how and where it counts.) If we thus say that painting is now to be defined through its discontinuity with itself, its inability to attain a presence that is not also represented and deferred, the history of painting becomes open to us in new ways. We might remark here, for example, the ways in which abstract expressionism is becoming newly available-its period and sense newly readable. For some, abstract expres- sionism has become interesting not as a step on the road to the Absolute of the Allover, but as an attempt to gain access to and present deep and private images and symbols of the self (and this may mean that Pollock is no longer the necessary genius and achievement of the movement--figures like Gottlieb and Baziotes and Stamos may take on new interest, and the itinerary of a Philip Guston can become exemplary for others). By the same token, a parallel demystifying impulse may choose to read in Pollock's drips mere and empty signs of freedom, bearing away their own implicit claim to spontaneity and depth. In either case we are rewriting failure and achievement out of our own impulse to heterology-creating a history to which an allegorical painting can be responsive. The duplicity of this rewriting should remind us that "allegory" has always been-and in the hands of a critic especially-a trope of both demystification and revalorization. It replaces the exclusive duality of the mere and the pure with the inclusive puzzle of what a thing "really" is, what the story really is. Allegorical painting, as it has emerged for recent criticism, is bound particularly to time and to story, to narrative. Sherman's mock film stills and Longo's drawings and reliefs (I would have you call these things "paintings") are understood as exemplary presentations of "hinges" whose significance is neither simply present nor simply borne away into story, but is rather given (not here, now now) as an undecidable crossing of possible narratives--stories of death or dancing, histories of menace or aspiration. To the extent that these paintings are for us the occasion of new and deep recognitions of painting as it constitutes itself in the intertwining of history and convention, they can recall us to "the essential fact of (what I refer to as) the modern" as it "lies in the relation between the present practice of an enterprise and the history of that enterprise, in the fact that this relation has become problematic."37 Allegory has its way of insisting on this problematic-on the uncertainty, at every moment, of the relation between a given present or claim to presence and the narratives--stories and histories-by which it is traversed and in 37. Cavell, Must We Mean. p. xix.</page><page sequence="28">82 OCTOBER which it could figure. The painting that matters will matter as it figures just such complex shuttling within and "between" the history of painting. It lets us say that one of the essential facts of the modern, now newly visible, is that from within it the relation between the practice of an enterprise and its past has always already become problematic: modernism has always already invaded the history and tradition from which it would distinguish itself, and so is capable of finding itself wherever it looks within that history (a point of muddled controversy between Greenberg and Steinberg). There are then ways in which the critical claim to the postmodern appears to find its deepest sense if the postmodern is understood to be itself an allegory of the modern. This possibility lies at the heart of these notes, setting the terms in which I would pose the question of Michael Fried's continuing visibility for and relevance to contemporary criticism. At the conclusion of his compelling two-part essay on "The Allegorical Impulse," Craig Owens writes, "This deconstructive impulse is characteristic of postmodernist art in general and must be distinguished from the self-critical tendency of modernism.""38 (Derrida likewise writes of his own deconstructive project, "Si elle en etait restee, ce qu'elle n'a jamais fait qu'aux yeux de ce qui tiraient beniefice de n'y rien voir, a' une simple deconstitution simantique ou conceptuelle, la deconstruction n'aurait forme qu'une modalit'-nouvelle-de l'auto-critique interne de la philosophie. Elle aurait risque de reproduire la propriete philosophique, le rapport a' soi de la philosophie, l'e'conomie de la mise en question traditionelle."39) I want to cast such suspicion as I can-not on Owens's imperative, which is a late and necessary repetition of the imperatives we have seen in Greenberg and Fried-but on the possibility of our making, successfully, such a distinction, however imperative it may be (remember Fried's insistence on the necessity of distinguishing the serious and the frivolous). I want to say that it is precisely because Owens repeats belatedly and for criticism the attempt at radical distinction and exclusion that Fried attempted for painting in "Art and Objecthood" that the distinction will not hold up-will break down just the way Fried's does-which is to say: powerfully, insistently, centrally. ... la dissemination qui ne joue pas, comme on le croirait trop facilement, avec le pluriel, le disperse, I'ipars, pas entre le multiplicitk et l'unite', mais entre l'unique. -Derrida, "Pas" 38.

It is so either because directness is forbidden (in which case its indirectness is merely its disguise, to be removed as soon as the coast is clear) or because directness is impossible for reasons inherent to that which would otherwise be communicated (in which case removing the disguise is removing the thing, revealing nothing-the ineffability to be communicated being present, to the extent that it is, precisely in-by virtue of-the disguise). Allegory divides itself into moments of concealing and revealing, covering over and bodying forth-and this division will generate the terms in which we will evaluate allegorical works, condemning those that appear to be artificial, merely coded, and playing simply upon the hiding of sense, and praising those that appear as more purely and properly allegorical, showing forth that which can be shown only as deferred and in deferral--postmodern decorum. This is, of course, an attempt to separate the merely allegorical from the purely so, and is, as such, condemned to the fate of all such projects. It is the details of this fate that are of interest to us. Allegory without a key-pure allegoresis, as it were-is no longer recognizable as allegory (allegory as such is lost in a pure play of signifiers and ungrounded process of semiosis-allegoresis by itself either falls below or passes beyond the region we want to call rhetori- cal). Allegory that is merely keyed, translatable, is dispensable and uninteresting, a code and nothing more. Allegory is undone by-lost in-its truth at both extremes; whether we take it literally, discarding the rhetorical shell to eat the inner meat, or take it literally, as the pure structure of purloined sense, allos agoreuein, we lose it.4? Allegory enforces its rhetoricity-its complexity-upon us. 40. For the figure of the shell and kernel (and its link to translation), see Jacques Derrida, "Me-</page><page sequence="30">84 OCTOBER This rhythm internal to allegory should recall the rhythm internal to criticism. To put it another way: allegory maintains itself between-and is deeply, internally menaced by-two automatisms, automatisms of sense and of semiosis. In different ways, each offers the double possibility of the achievement and the undoing of allegory. Allegory remains its own doing only for so long as it is unachieved, seaming, in time, semiosis and sense, succumbing to neither. Allegor- ical work that presents a claim upon us does so because of the way it insists on time, recognizing it can exert that claim only in time, so perhaps only for a time (history is its condition). A new wrinkle in the dialectic of absorption and theatricality: a work can remove us from the time in which we come to it only by rewriting that time as its own. The claim to allegory takes up a definite position in relation to and in terms of the dialectic explored in Fried's work. If the theatrical temptation in Greuze (for example) is that we will be drawn into the work only to lose ourselves and it in the narrative that flows through it and plunges us back into the time we thought to transcend (the paintings appear finally sentimental), the new works would explicitly pose their openness to narrative(s) in such a way that one cannot be simply swept away by the story. (Cindy Sherman's pictures are perhaps nostalgic, but would be rigorously unsentimental.) The work thus becomes an emblem of narrativity ("as such") and gains its (difficult) presence-its claim upon us- Psychoanalysis: An Introduction to the Translation of 'The Shell and the Kernel,' by Nicolas Abraham," trans.

On the purloining of sense, see Jacques Lacan, "Seminar on 'The Purloined Letter,' " trans. Jeffrey Mehlman, Yale French Studies, no. 48. The original French text appears in Lacan, Ecrits, Paris, Seuil, 1966, and a transcript of the actual seminar from which the essay emerged appears in Lacan, Le Moi dans la thkorie de Freud et dans la technique de la psychanalyse (Le Seminaire, livre 2), Paris, Seuil, 1978. Derrida's rejoinder, "Le Facteuir de la verit&amp;," first appeared in Poktique and is now available in La Carte postale: de Socrates a Freud et au-dela, Paris, Aubier-Flammnarion, 1980; a translation, "The Purveyor of Truth," appears in Yale French Studies, no. 52 (some of the footnotes in this committee translation are seriously muddled). The controversy between Lacan and Derrida can appear in the present context as an argument about the relation between allegory and that truth it bears (and through which it loses itself). An interest in this argument is, I take it, reflected in Fineman's effort to "maintain the validity of the distinction between literature and its criticism" over and against the "infinite, indefinite, unbounded extension of what nowadays is called textuality." It would seem that both in the case of Lacan and Derrida and that ot literature and its criticism what is needed is a way of clinging to the controversy or distinction itself. Like Fineman, I want to register a certain dissatisfaction with a (presumably de Manian) criticism that "projects its own critical unhappiness onto literature, whose self- deconstruction would then be understood as criticism." But I am loath to set against such a denial of psychoanalysis an equally simple revalorization of the truth of psychoanalysis. What I would like is a more oblique approach that would let one see how both denial and reaffirmation fall similarly short of the necessary recognition of criticism. But all of this belongs, obviously, to another essay. It is perhaps enough to remark here that my Derrida suspects Fineman's Lacan as I presume his Lacan suspects my Derrida; if we can do this well we will be doing the necessary. (I have been quoting Finemnan's "Allegorical Desire," pp. 64-65.)</page><page sequence="31">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 85 precisely through this admission of time. More radically: it gains its presence and claim upon us through its appropriation of the time in which we think to come to it, and through its mastery of this "unavoidable condition of intelligibility." What needs stressing here is that this claim takes its sense from a problematic that implicitly recognizes the continuing need for painting to (impossibly) recover itself from theatricality and that further assumes that the continuing deep task of painting is to master the conditions of its own intelligibility, "the primordial convention that paintings are made to be beheld." Painting has-still-to make itself count as painting, as art: as counting. This brings us to what I take to be the deepest and most difficult point in Fried's work. However convinced we may be that the making of art is natural to man, we have no access to it, no way to speak of it, except insofar as it is profoundly conventional and thus caught between invisibility and fragility. Art makes itself count only by exposing itself and so also its fragility, its gratuitous- ness and arbitrariness; such strength as it has it has only so long as it remains invisible, so long as it passes for natural. Fried's phrase, "the primordial conven- tion that paintings are made to be beheld," conceals and reveals at once the essential contradiction that makes of art a historical activity. The same contradic- tion makes of art history simultaneously a means and a block to that activity. (This, I hope, is a way of saying something about what Smithson glimpsed in geology and the fact of the prehistoric.) We know or we think we know, more or less, what it means to speak of, for example, a "convention" that certain paintings are not to be beheld. A religious sanction perhaps. But we ought to feel very confused by the notion that it is also a "convention" that paintings are made to be beheld. In the case of the religious prohibition we know what it means to defy the convention-we just go ahead and do what (so to speak) comes naturally, we look at the painting instead of averting our eyes. But what could it mean to subvert this other convention? In a sense, this convention is failed or broken exactly the same way it is met: by "casting one's eyes on" (I'm groping for a neutral phrase) the canvas. What intervenes between success and failure here is just the recognition of the conventionality of this act (the recognition that we could have looked and still not seen). (This is why Fried glosses theatricality in "Art and Objecthood" in terms of "seeing works as nothing more than objects" and why he goes on to write that "literalist sensibility is, therefore a response to the same developments that have largely compelled modernist painting to undo its objecthood-more precisely, the same develop- ments seen differently, that is, in theatrical terms, by a sensibility already theatrical, already (to say the worst) corrupted or perverted by theatre.'"41 The eye the critic needs here is more than formal.) 41. Fried, "Art and Objecthood," p. 136.</page><page sequence="32">86 OCTOBER In acknowledging the conventionality of beholding, we rescue our vision from its own automatisms-automatisms, variously, of more or less natural habit and more or less sophisticated and art historical taste-automatisms released by a thirst for the guarantees of the literal or by a surrender to the simplicity of radical flux. "Automatism" is then the name of a risk,42 a deep motive to self-criticism and to indirection, menacing both (so that what I take to be self-criticism may be mere narcissism; what I take to be indirect discourse may be self-indulgence or nonsense). "Self-criticism" may appear as the demand for the reduction of the literary and rhetorical. Indirection may appear as a call for rhetoricity and a recovery of ornament. Each is justified, to the extent that it is, by the history it makes and in which it would inscribe itself. Each such call appears as an emblematic summary of an unsummarizable history (a text), inscribing itself as such within the inner plurality, dissemination, of art history. "Breakthrough paintings" are now-and have therefore always been-everywhere and nowhere- painted and repainted in works that complexly hinge their pasts. "Art history" is, now more than ever (but always now more than ever) the Great Automatism through which modern art lives its death and dies its life. Heads I win, tails you lose: art history quarantees at once everything and nothing. Cavell's caution is, finally, terrifying: A familiar answer is that time will tell. But my question is: What will time tell? That certain departures in art-like pursuits have become established (among certain audiences, in textbooks, on walls, in college courses); that someone is treating them with the respect due, we feel, to art; that one no longer has the right to question their status?43 We can only stand, unsponsored, ever more directly before time's radical (non)certification of our art and criticism, bearing and baring what we can, clinging to the difficult uncertainty of a present divided from itself-an uncer- tainty that demands our judgment, our acts of inclusion and exclusion, if its experience is to count for us: 42. With this I at once address and elide the central matter of the photograph. I find myself still struggling with the notions advanced by Crimp in "The Photographic Activity of Postmodernism" (October, no. 15 [Winter 1980], 91-101), as well as his still more recent essays, "The End of Painting' (October, no. 16 [Spring 1981], 69-86) and "The Museum's Old/The Library's New Subject," Parachute, no. 22 [Spring 1981], 32-37). My inclination here will, I assume, be obvious: it is to say that photography is a central place for the posing of questions of automatism and that photographic work will inevitably be touched by that questioning, so that we will find ourselves forced to such assertions as that the photograph has "acquired an aura, only now its is a function not of presence, but of absence, severed from an origin, from an originator, from autheticity," and that "in our time, the aura has become only a presence, which is to say a ghost" ("Photographic Activity," p. 100). But I will also say that this does not free us from problems of aura and presence-rather it frees us into them and their complexity. The loss (or gain) of aura will not be simple. 43.

Theses and results are CONDITIONS OF PUBLICITY things that can be believed and accepted; but Kierkegaard and Wittgenstein do not want to be believed and accepted, and therewith, of course, dismissed. And not just any way of addressing an audience will leave them as they are, leave them alone, but transformed. These are effects we have come to expect of art. ... -Cavell, "Existentialism and Analytical Philosophy" This is then where we stand, in difficult times. If there is a simple moral in our situation, it is perhaps just this: the existence of the beholder, which is to say the primordial convention that paintings are made to be beheld, has emerged as problematic for painting as never before. And: what we are newly recognizing is that the art of painting is inescapably addressed to an audience that must be gathered. And: we are attempting to acknowledge that this is now as fully and explicitly a problem for criticism as it is for painting. We have been concerned throughout this essay with the way-and time-in which that audience is gathered-with the conditions under which a work has a public. This concern demands a new or renewed attention to and awareness of the depth of complicity between painting and criticism. In this situation, criticism stands, or could, or should stand, in an altered relation to the art it serves. At any time, it is subordinate to that art, and expendable once the experience of an art or period or departure is established. But in the modern situation it seems inevitable, even, one</page><page sequence="34">88 OCTOBER might say, internal, to the experience of art . . . Often one does not know whether interest is elicited and sustained primarily by the object or by what can be said about the object. My suggestion is not that this is bad, but that it is definitive of a modernist situation.44 Art is not simply and accidentally given over to criticism. This is part of what follows on our recognition of the primordial conventionality of art. We might also say that criticism is not (not simply) observation. Allegory forces these recognitions; allegorical works do not exist except in a universe of continuing allegoresis, commentary, and interpretation. Allegory demands criticism, confus- ing the line between itself and its criticism-in such confusion criticism must take account of itself as well as of its simpler "object." (The risk here is of the theatricalization of criticism, its regressive sublation into the ether of what might then be called "metatheory" or "metacriticism" [as if these were names for a purer criticism or theory].) The present essay would not constitute a work of metacriticism or an exercise in the metatheoretical. It is occasioned by an experience of criticism and would speak of and to that; it would speak also (obscurely, indirectly) of the condition of art. But it can guarantee nothing out of itself. Allegory, as a trope of revelation and concealment, is a mode at once public and private, and if allegorical works appear to embody the deep and obscure promptings of the self, they do so successfully only to the extent that these promptings are communicable, are already what we might call "public." Such works pose as a condition of their inner sense their outer publicity; they are works that demand a beholder, and they do so in order to show the beholder his or her own difficult presence to (absence from) the work. The allegories of sense and gesture, convention, that have been seen in the work of Longo, Anderson, Goldstein, Sherman, and others are visible as such only to the extent that they are recognized as deeply responsive to the issues raised in "Art and Objecthood"- questions of anthropomorphism, the privacy and publicity-hiddenness and openness-of the self, of the other. "Art and Objecthood" tends strongly to align surface with publicity and depth with privacy. The hollow literalist form appears as a person who presents himself to us in and from his sense of radical privacy-presents himself as withdrawn, distant, distancing, even mocking. In this view, Pollock counts as a discoverer of surface and it is this discovery he hands down to his strongest heirs- to Louis, Noland, Olitski. The weak are left with the rest-an expressionist ideology, an insistence on the self. As the surface becomes ever more compellingly and powerfully charged, the self, having become its own deep and private object (having become object to itself-ironized, distanced) becomes ever more naked, 44. Ibid., p. 207.</page><page sequence="35">Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory 89 ever more exposed to its public. The passage from Smith and Judd to Acconci is- as I have tried to show elsewhere45-simply a matter of consequences literally drawn. In dialectics the world unfolds through the failures of the moment. It was only out of the drive toward radical privacy in art and out of an insistence on forcing the relation between art and its beholder into mere externality (the reduction of that relation to one of mere objectivity and knowledge), that the failures of such a vision of privacy (and of publicity) could become once again visible. (And here the essential contrast is between an art that insists on criticism as a reflection and acknowledgment of the way in which public and private always have interpenetrated one another and so are seamed in one another, and an art that would construct itself as an epistemological problem, daring its beholder to know it.) Success, whatever its other virtues, rarely has a future. The trick some painting seems now to be attempting is to succeed precisely through its failure. As Owens writes: When the postmodernist work speaks of itself, it is no longer to proclaim its autonomy, its self-sufficiency, its transcendence; rather, it is to narrate its own contingency, insufficiency, lack of transcendence. It tells of a desire that must be perpetually deferred; as such, its decon- structive thrust is aimed not only against the contemporary myths that furnish its subject matter, but also against the symbolic, totalizing impulse which characterizes modern art.46 If Pollock, for example, counts for this painting, he counts now in the tension between his surface and its presumptive depth, the way these terms interlock in and as the condition of his work's gathering an audience, the way in which his work means to mean and does not (quite). This Pollock is one who painted in time, whose canvas marks the time of that painting, its dissemblings and forgettings (of drawing, for example), its revelation and concealment of its own depths-a flatbed, a table, a tableau that would explicitly bear the marks of the time it freezes and gathers into itself. If Louis is a recovery and repetition of Pollock, so also is Rauschenberg-the two possibilities are entwined in one another, are each other's condition of possibility. But it is through Rauschenberg that the story of painting's confusion with and dependence on the theater is narrated, and it is Rauschenberg's work that seems increasingly capable of standing as emblem--hinge-for the past decades. 45.

To the left and in the background, Alex Hay turns away from the camera, looking for all the world like a figure out of Longo. How many ways do the limits between the modern and the postmodern, painting and theater and dance and photogra- phy, presence and representation, hinge in this picture?) In the spring of 1980 Joel Fineman published an article on psychoanalysis and allegory in October. His piece was accompanied by an essay on the allegorical impulse by Craig Owens. The next issue included a second essay by Owens on allegory and postmodernism, and an essay on Rauschenberg and museums, photography and postmodernism by Douglas Crimp. Further in the background is Crimp's essay, "Pictures," from October 8-which first picked out the group of artists and issues around which the ensuing discussions have turned. Now there is this baggy monster, as well as whatever may have intervened between then and now.47 All of this may amount to-in the minds of the various writers concerned or in the minds of their readers or in fact-the articulation of a particular theoretical and critical prise de position (like, perhaps, "Art and Objecthood"). Inevitably it will be at least that. But that may also be merely the least of what this spate of articles is or should be. To the extent that this series of writings amounts to the taking of a position, the presentation of a thesis, it presents a position that is fundamentally not different from (only later than) the position Fried has been building all these years-and it is powerful, if it is, precisely because this is what it is. If there is something newer than this in these writings, it is in themselves, their rhythms, and their embeddedness in one another: the world in which they are present to one another and to their readers. If the present notes seem designed to force a certain acknowledgment of Fried-of what is not (so) new in the postmodern-this design can only be accomplished by forcing the novelty as well, by insisting on the opacity and heterogeneity of criticism, the complexity of its allegiances and the absoluteness of its entanglement with the terms and practices it is tempted to theorize more simply and know. In this sense, I hope to recall criticism from its attained positions to the time of its practice and the risks concomitant with it.

But it does, and they do, and the consequent danger is that the words, because inescapable, will usurp motivation alto- gether, no longer tested by the results they enable ... this suggests that a central importance of criticism has become to protect its art against criticism. Not just from bad criticism, but from the critical impulse altogether, which no longer knows its place, perhaps because it no longer has a place.48 The dangers here are dangers to which this essay may have already suc- cumbed. We began, it may be recalled, by dismissing certain fears that have now returned in a much deeper form and, so to speak, for real. I may be forgetting Fried even in my claim to recall him-I may be forgetting the notion of art he (and I) claim to serve. There is no way the news can be gotten out without risking, undecidably, a crime or glory of one's own. A part of the news that would be gotten out is of "postmodernism," and the crime risked in getting this out is that of forgetting modernism as something that has counted and continues to count for us (the name, for example, of the way in which we can now gather about a work of art). Such forgetting may also be the glory. "Postmodernism" means, if it means anything, something about the way in which modernism must inevitably come to see in itself its own allegory (and so also something like its own failure, its nonidentity with itself-but these then would be the terms of its power and success). Where postmodernism would mean something more radically separate from modernism (where it would forget modernism) it will end by forgetting itself as well-and it will do so by falling into the trap of modernism's favored mode of (self-)forgetting, the (non)dialectic of the mere and the pure. Postmodernism would proof itself against this risk by appealing to a deconstructive impulse working beyond the (merely) self-critical tendency of modernism-but the risk shows itself in the bare statement: the practice of deconstruction cannot rigorously hold itself apart from something called self-criticism except by hypostasizing its self in just the way it would avoid; it can articulate itself only insofar as it acknowledges explicitly its emergence from and dependence upon what might otherwise appear as mere self-criticism. If postmodernism names modernism insofar as it is inevitably its own allegory, 48.
