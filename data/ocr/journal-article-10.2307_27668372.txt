<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche's Attempted Escape from Schopenhauer's South Asian Sources in The Birth of Tragedy Robert Bruce Cowan Hunter College, The City University of New York Georg Simmel asked what Nietzsche's debt to Schopenhauer exactly was and Martin Heidegger wondered whether Nietzsche succeeds in breaking out of traditional Western metaphysics. Nietzsche is unable to escape from the South Asian sources in Schopenhauer's system to establish a response to nihilism that is both non-metaphysical and non-anthro pomorphic for his thinking will always characterize itself as a negation of metaphysics. Nietzsche's creation of a materialist teleology suffers from the same disjunction that Scho penhauer found between Will and eudemonia. By the period of the first German unification (1862-1871), the touted superiority of the bourgeoisie born of the Industrial Revolution gave way to what would come to be called a fin-de-si?cle mood of spiritual emptiness. German political unification had once again not brought about the national cultural recognition that many had fervendy anticipated and many German citizens fell into the material pursuit of building their local economies. Those who criticized the "nihilism" of their materialistic contemporaries looked to imagined pasts to understand their future destiny. Many would continue the preoccupations of the Early German Romantics and look to India for both their national origin and fate. Friedrich Nietzsche was not among them, and yet, he could not escape their legacy. The affiliation of Germans with India, which had begun in earnest in the anthropological works of J. G. Herder and reached its philosophical fruition in those of Arthur Schopenhauer, persisted. By the 1870s, the social sciences in Germany focused on discovering the origins of human civilization, and the beginnings of Social Darwinism fueled growing feelings of cultural supremacy. For Nietzsche, however, the problem of his age was not nationalism, Social Darwinism, or the lack of a culturally and politically cohesive nation, so much as the lack of a replacement for what he felt to be the decline of traditional religious and metaphysical ways of thinking. While he appears to have felt that the "God-hypothesis," as well as all metaphysical substitutes for it, was unworthy of belief in the first place, he worried that their demise left a void that reason could not adequately fill, thus endangering the health of civilization. Nietzsche tried to find his own replacement for "nihilism" that was not religious or metaphysical, to provide an answer, or answers, that were not</page><page sequence="2">538 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) based on a divinity or impersonal absolute of any kind. He criticizes and ap pears to reject the related postulations from the schools of post-Kantianism and Hegelianism of "things-in-themselves" and substantial "souls." Though a follower of Schopenhauer early on, Nietzsche criticizes his "educator" starting in his first work, Die Geburt der Trag?die oder Griechentum und Pessimismus (1872). Nietzsche sees himself as an optimist, affirming material embodiment in the face of Schopenhauer's inhuman transcendence. Martha C. Nussbaum warns that the reader of Die Geburt der Trag?die must have already read Schopenhauer to understand his dichotomy of Apollonian and Dionysian, yet Schopenhauer warns that the reader of his masterwork, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung (1818,1844), must have already read the Upanishads to understand his work.1 Thus, one might argue that an acquaintance with Vedic thought is crucial to an understanding of The Birth of Tragedy. Prior to 1883, when Nietzsche read Das System des Vedanta by his friend Paul Deussen, Schopenhauer appears to have been his only source for Hindu and Buddhist thought, although this has been recently disputed.2 Yet, it remains unclear the extent to which Deussen's work may or may not have influenced Nietzsche's later thinking on Asian topics. Nietzsche's apparent lack of under standing of Schopenhauer's Hindu and Buddhist influences leads him to construe Schopenhauer's philosophy as denying that human beings are capable of positive action, thus falling in line with E W. J. Schelling and Friedrich Schlegel who ultimately found South Asian religious ideas to be nihilistic. Nietzsche thus breaks with the tradition of affiliating Germany with India for two reasons. First, he did not look to India for metaphysical, linguistic, or racial answers to German or European questions, as did Novalis, Schelling, and the brothers Schlegel. Secondly, and more importandy, he appears to categorically reject the religious and metaphysical foundations of the German India fascination, as well as those of the great monotheistic religions. One thus finds in Nietzsche a set of concerns that is indebted to the earlier German fascination with India, but as a reversal of it. At the same time, his vindication of transcendent art may be seen as distinctly metaphysical in character and his exhortation for man to develop into something "higher" distincdy religious. Therefore, this essay is intended as a contribution to two debates. The first, launched largely by Georg Simmel's Schopenhauer und Nietzsche: Ein Vortrags zyklus (1907), concerns the extent of Nietzsche's debt to Schopenhauer. The second, begun by Martin Heidegger in his lectures on Nietzsche between 1936 and 1940, is the extent to which Nietzsche succeeds in breaking out of tradi tional Western metaphysics. Heidegger argues in "Nietzsche's Fundamental Metaphysical Position" (1937) that Nietzsche connects Parmenides definition of being-as-existence with Heraclitus' definition of being-as-becoming by envisioning Creation as something that needs a fixed ground to which it can juxtapose itself, thus bringing Western metaphysics to a close by wedding its</page><page sequence="3">Robert Bruce Cowan 539 two initial positions. I will argue, however, that Nietzsche will never be able to establish a philosophy that is non-metaphysical, for his thinking will always characterize itself as a negation of metaphysics. Where Simmel sees Nietzsche as a counterpoint to Schopenhauer, I find Nietzsche's philosophy suffers from the same contradictions. Nietzsche will be unable to escape from the South Asian sources in Schopenhauer's system to establish a response to nihilism that is both non-metaphysical and non-anthropomorphic. 1. Schopenhauer's Anti-theodicy Schopenhauer was out of step with his contemporaries in the tradition of Ger man idealism. He was, however, one of the most avid readers of the English Indological publications that began to appear in the 1790s and were numerous by the 1810s. Golo Mann finds him among those eccentrics who "obtain learning from ancient books and look quietly with complete detachment at their world, as though they themselves did not belong to it" (History of Germany 141).3 This is true and one could argue that Asian philosophy, which often emphasizes cultivating detachment from what Nietzsche will call the "all-too-human," would naturally appeal to one who was already detached in many ways, as was Schopenhauer. His interest in Hindu and Buddhist topics began around the age of 2 5, just after he submitted his doctoral thesis at Jena University, when he met the orientalist Friedrich Majer at the young philosopher's mother's salon in Weimar, then one of the centers of what has come to be called Hochromantik. The Sanskrit text that Schopenhauer would initially become most familiar with through translations was the Upanishads, the philosophical conclusion derived from the Vedas. As Frederick Copleston has pointed out, Schopenhauer's philosophy bears some resemblance to Advaita (non-dualism), the most promi nent form of Ved?nta* Schopenhauer believed that the two key ideas in Kantian thought are (1) that human beings experience the world as representations of the data of the senses and (2) behind this world or its representations is the thing-in-itself, which Kant felt one can never know. Similarly, in his other two primary sources?Plato's dialogues and the Upanishads - "representation" is construed as only a relative reality, which would later in the history of Hindu ism be called Maya or "illusion," something that is not eternal reality. What Schopenhauer would then present was an alternate path that ideal ism might have taken?for he advocated a return to Kant's three critiques that ignored the works of Reinhold, Schulze, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel?a path that wed his own vision of transcendental idealism to the fascination for Indian ideas that the Jena Romantics had begun. Post-Kantians may have attempted to tease out issues of practicality from states of existence purported to be beyond human ken. For Schopenhauer, however, post-Kantianism was doomed from the start, because even Schelling, whose philosophy of becoming had been profoundly affected by Sanskrit texts such as Jayadeva's medieval lyric poem</page><page sequence="4">540 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) Gitagovinda, denies the importance of what for Schopenhauer is the second key doctrine that Kant expounds in Kritik der reinen Vernunft: the thing-in-it self. Kant argues that knowledge of the thing-in-itself is impossible because it transcends all our cognitive functions based on time, space, and causality. Yet, the equation of the thing-in-itself with will as the fundamental reality forms the basis of Schopenhauer's entire metaphysical system. The "Absolute" to be found in forms of idealism such as Hegel's are denied by Schopenhauer out of hand, in favor of a fundamental reality with which one hopes to reintegrate one's individual soul. Based on his interpretation of Kant, and of Plato for that matter, Schopenhauer accepted the disjunction between the phenomena of the natural world and the noumena that he felt lay within it. Schopenhauer thought Schelling's attempt to unify subject and object in his explanation of nature and human freedom was misguided, for he felt that there could be no unity of the material world and the Absolute, and in fact Schopenhauer's Absolute bears a much greater resemblance to Brahman than to any "absolute" found in German idealism.5 Schopenhauer feels that the phenomenal world must be transcended in order to reach the noumenal, although the noumenal is not "experienced" like the phenomenal; it is rejoined. Ultimately, Schopenhauer takes "the world as representation" as almost a given and devotes most of his work to discussions of the thing-in-itself, the will, aesthetic experience, the roles of the genius and mystic, and transcendence of the material. Schopenhauer will not only construe representation as m?y? in his text, but claims that his philosophy can provide a framework from which one can deduce all the basic arguments of the Upanishads. He admonishes in Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung that while a thorough knowledge of Plato and Kant is assumed, if his reader has shared in the benefit of the Vedas, access to which, opened to us by the Upanishads, is in my view the greatest advantage which this still young cen tury has to show over previous centuries, since I surmise that the influence of Sanskrit literature will penetrate no less deeply than did the revival of Greek literature in the fifteenth century (WWR 1: xv).6 If one heeds Schopenhauer's warning not to read his masterwork without ac quaintance with Vedic literature, and avoids the tendency to view him merely as Hegel's enemy and a precursor to Kierkegaard, the extent to which Hindu and Buddhist ideas influence his work is abundandy apparent. It would not be inaccurate to divide Schopenhauer's philosophy into three main parts roughly conforming to the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, as John E. Atwell has done. These would consist of (1) the observation that material existence is primarily composed of suffering, (2) the "diagnosis" that suffering is a manifestation of the "will to live," and (3) the "cure" that by ceasing to will, suffering abates and, in extreme cases, totally disappears.7 As in the Hindu and Buddhist idea of karma,</page><page sequence="5">Robert Bruce Cowan 541 for Schopenhauer, one is responsible for the suffering that one experiences and therefore deserves it. The debate, however, between the idea that one can achieve immediate enlightenment and the notion that such an event can occur only after lifetimes of working up the karmic ladder has been a point of debate between competing schools of Hinduism and Buddhism for centuries and will prove problematic for Nietzsche's understanding of this concept. Unlike Early Romantics such as Novalis or Schlegel, there is no attempt on Schopenhauer's part to conflate the teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism with the Judeo-Christian tradition or with Greco-Roman mythology. Schopenhauer, however, like the German Indo-philes before him, appears to locate the origins of the Old Testament in the Zoroastrian Zend-Avesta and those of the New Testament in Indian religion. He observes in "?ber Religion" in Parerga und Paralipomena, "The NewTestament must [somehow] be of Indian origin: witness of that is its altogether Indian ethic, in which morality leads to asceticism, its pessimism and its avatar" (PP1:190).8 A bit farther on he asserts, "Everything true in Christianity is also to be discovered in Brahmanism and Buddhism (ibid. 191).9 Yet, Schopenhauer does not feel that theJudeo-Christian tradition is as useful as the Near- and Far-Eastern texts from which he feels it is derived, for he finds it less applicable to practical human situations. While Book I of Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung concerns material con tained in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis?the fact that perceptible objects are only representations formed according to spatial, temporal, and causal properties?Book II attempts to understand the reality within such properties. Schopenhauer argues that neither realist philosophy nor empirical science can help us experience the reality behind representation, because object and representation are indistinguishably one. Phenomena, in other words, have an inner, insensible reality: the thing-in-itself, independent of the principle of suf ficient reason. What is confusing about Schopenhauer's conception of the will, it seems even to him, is that he appears to mean both the fundamental reality and the human volition that one tries to overcome in reintegrating oneself with that reality. Schopenhauer's conception of the will is thus not unlike that of the unity, or yoga, of ?tman and Brahman, from the Sanskrit verb yukta (to yoke). Will, for Schopenhauer, is both ?tman and Brahman, both the individual embodied soul and the impersonal universal soul. Will moves through us and around us, motivates our actions in a blind, instinctual way, and yet helps us act intentionally to overcome our embodiment. While B. V. Kishan incorrecdy asserts that Schopenhauer "believes" in the "concreteness" of the world (despite Schopenhauer's assertion that the world of the senses is phenomenal), he is cor rect in stating that Schopenhauer does not make the material, representational world mind-dependent, but will-dependent.10 Schopenhauer asserts that the human mind constructs the world of appearances, but only the representation ofthat world is dependent on the subject. The world as fundamental reality is</page><page sequence="6">542 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) dependent on the will. Scholarship on Schopenhauer has tended to conflate these two wills as Schopenhauer himself largely does. Some clarity may be found, however, in the fact that, for Schopenhauer, different types of things manifest the will to different extents. Like Schelling, Schopenhauer accounts for these differences by invoking Plato's Ideas.11 Plato first presents the concept that the percep tible world is an imperfect image of a realm of unobservable and unchanging "forms" in &amp;ai?ov [Phaedo] (c.325 BC). In quotidian experience, we rarely notice the "Idea" behind the object, concerning ourselves instead with their pragmatic relationships to us. Taking, therefore, a lead from Plato, like some other post-Kantians and the Jena Romantics, Schopenhauer in effect argues that, to establish a tenable relationship between nature and human freedom, Kantianism had to culminate in a kind of Spinozism, which is a philosophy that relocates man's place in Nature by equating Nature itself with God. While Indo-philes Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel take destructive, Shaivic stances on the issue of freedom, and Schelling an equilibrating Vaishnavic position, Schopenhauer concentrates on the Brahmanic, the creative. He emphasizes the sin inherent in creating the world, as in the myth of Prometheus. In "Fragmente zur Geschichte der Philosophie" in Parerga, Schopenhauer argues that redemption is a concept of Indian origin, for it "presupposes the Indian teaching according to which the origin of the world (this Samsara of the Buddhists) is itself based on evil; that is to say, it is a sinful act of Brahma (PP 1: 62).12 Schopenhauer, however, acknowledges that his characterization of Brahma as evil is an interpretation of Indian mythology rather than an actual statement of accepted Hindu doctrine.13 This remark is in contrast to Friedrich Schlegel, who argues in ?ber die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier (1808) that with the Hindu doctrine of emanation, which states that everything else that exists is an emanation from a primordial unity, the world is mistakenly viewed as degraded. Thus only the realm of the Creator is a place of divine bliss. This kind of (Christian) Creator does not exist for Schopenhauer, however. Creation is for him more akin to that found in later Hinduism, a non-anthropomorphic occurrence. In Book III of Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, on the art object, Scho penhauer describes the only two realms of experience in which one is aided in abandoning the self, the first of which is aesthetic experience?particularly the experience of the sublime, which quiets the will?the other of which is asceti cism. Schopenhauer concludes this section on the plastic arts by noting that ultimately the experience of art results in resignation, in the abolition of the will, which he writes is the innermost spirit of Christianity and of Hinduism and Buddhism. For Schopenhauer, the art form that most successfully approached transcendence was music. Romanticism had emphasized music's "subjective inwardness" as exemplary of autonomous, human freedom. For Schopenhauer,</page><page sequence="7">Robert Bruce Cowan 543 however, music was the sound of fundamental reality: ... music is as immediate an objectification and copy of the whole will as the world itself is, indeed as the Ideas are, the multiplied phenomenon of which constitutes the world of individual things. Therefore, music is by no means like the other arts, namely a copy of the Ideas, but is a copy of the will itself, the objectivity of which are the Ideas, (ibid. 257)14 This is similar to the reverence with which the sacred syllable "OM" is held in Hinduism. Appearing throughout its literature, OM is not considered a word, but a symbol and syllable that is a manifestation of spiritual power and betokens the presence of the absolute within both ?tman and Brahman. Coincident with the Romantic elevation of music in German society generally at this time was the elevation of Kant's notion of the "genius." For Schopenhauer, the exemplar of genius is the composer, in particular Beethoven, who reveals the fundamental reality beyond even his own comprehension. In the work of art, however, despite his genius, the artist can only escape the suffering of life fleetingly. The fourth and final book o? Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung concerns the "geniuses" of morality: the saint and the ascetic. The saint identifies with the suffering of others, without the aid of intellectual understanding, by breaking through the world of representation, in which we appear to be separate be ings in often antagonistic relationships. The same is true of the ascetic. For Schopenhauer, this involves the innate quality of denying the very substratum of which human life is but an expression. He prefers the New Testament of the Bible perhaps because it presents an exemplary, benevolent figure for the human being to emulate. According to the Bible, one cannot become Christ, but one can become a Buddha, at least according to Gautama Buddha. It is no wonder that ultimately Schopenhauer's philosophy bears more resemblance to Buddhism than to Hinduism, for Buddhist morality seems more likely to engender hope and compassion than can an omnipotent will that is not an exemplar for human action. Though "all-too-human" in his personal life, the example of Buddha-hood, and by extension notions o? nirvana, fascinated Schopenhauer. Some clarifica tion of the ideas around the term nirvana is necessary here. In Sanskrit, nirvana literally means "extinction." In Hinduism, however, it connotes a state of lib eration, characterized by the merging o? ?tman and Brahman, which frees one from suffering, the cyclic tedium of death and rebirth, and all other bonds of material incarnation. In Mah?y?na Buddhism, though the meaning is largely the same, the notion of nirvana undergoes an historical change that may be attributed to the introduction of the bodhisattva ideal and to an emphasis placed on the unified nature of the world. Nirvana in this context has sometimes been described in later Buddhism as the bliss that one feels in experiencing one's identity with the absolute, thus leading some practitioners to believe that</page><page sequence="8">544 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) nirvana is a material state that is itself to be surpassed, until even bliss disappears. Schuhmacher and Woerner point out that the simile of extinguishing a flame is used. The fire that appears to go out does not pass away because its energy changes state. It merely becomes invisible by passing into space. Thus the term nirvana indicates entry into another mode of existence that is omnipresent.15 Therefore, even the idea of the void as nothing is a misnomer. A void is empty of anything that a human being can perceive with the senses, but this is to define "void" in the realms of metaphysics or mysticism, not physics. Schuhmacher and Woerner go on to add that whether one uses terms such as "bliss" or "annihilation," words are inadequate to describe nirvana, and one must remember that it is not "being nothing." One might note that Schopenhauer is careful to use the term nichts (nothing) as opposed to the n?ant (nothingness) of the existentialists. By the same token, Schopenhauer finds in dharma the possibility of deny ing the will-to-live, but seems to feel the need to point out that the pursuit of "eudemonology" is a worthy and necessary goal. In Parerga und Paralipomena, he refers several times to "eudemonology" (from the Greek eudemonia, meaning "happiness," which appears most prominently in Aristotle's Ts/vna PnvopiKrja [Rhetoric] 1:5). In his "Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit," Schopenhauer describes eudemonology as the art of getting through life as pleasantly and successfully as possible. While he admits that his philosophy argues that an existence in which one is attached to and satisfied by materiality is impossible, he appears late in his life to be preoccupied by the problem of happiness. He is torn by such a preoccupation and laments "to be able to work out such an answer, I have therefore had to abandon entirely the higher metaphysical ethical standpoint to which [my] real philosophy leads (PP1: 313).16 His discussion of living a happy life, therefore, rests on a compromise and the term "eudemonology" is to be read as a euphemism, for he can entertain only the possibility of a conditional happiness. This preoccupation with happiness appears to fly in the face of the fact that Schopenhauer's philosophy is known as "Pessimism." His philosophy may be called pessimism for its renunciation of materialism, if one finds materialism personally edifying. Schopenhauer's noting that the world of representation is one of suffering is, however, as in Buddhism, merely the launching point for a philosophy that attempts to look beyond material incarnation and toward what the Jena Romantics would have called "salvation." According to Gautama Buddha, the notion of the self has to be given up by the individual if he or she wants to break the cycle of rebirth into suffering. For Schopenhauer, as well, the individual must overcome dependence on knowledge that is attained through the principle of sufficient reason before he can hope to understand the will. To manage this, Schopenhauer does not advocate the path of asceticism, which renounces teleology completely; he does, however, admonish against</page><page sequence="9">Robert Bruce Cowan 545 over-attachment to the self, which is posited merely because the senses meet objects and give rise to physical sensations. While Kant found that understanding the nature of the world as things in-themselves inspired him to live a moral life, Schopenhauer's understanding of the world as will merely highlights the futility of most human action. Terry Pinkard states, "freedom, the watchword of all Kantian and post-Kantian philosophy, was, for Schopenhauer, the freedom to rid ourselves of the illusions of freedom in the first place, which is possible only for the most cultured and rarefied of people."17 The only form of freedom that remained for Schopenhauer was the freedom to overcome will. Schopenhauer thus found post-Kantianism's hopes for a world of rational freedom na?ve, arguing that one must abandon Enlightenment-era goals. For him the abandonment of the self does not signal detachment from others, however, for in abandonment he felt that distinctions between self and others would vanish as one comes closer to integration with the will. Loss of self fosters not apathy, but sympathy: We now see that for such a just man the principium individuationis is no longer an absolute partition as it is for the bad; that he does not, like the bad man, affirm merely his own phenomenon of will and deny all others; that others are not for him mere masks, whose inner nature is quite different from his. On the contrary, he shows by his way of acting that he again recognizes his own inner being, namely the will-to-live as thing-in-itself, in the phenomenon of another given to him merely as representation. (WWR 1: 370)18 Schopenhauer thus appears to formulate an "anti-theodicy"?a justification of good in the face of evil, and this without the help of a personal god. God, for Schopenhauer, is only anthropomorphically dead, for his divine is an im personal universal will. Schopenhauer had no faith in politics, for he felt it to be unconcerned with empathy. His lack of hope for political change made him well-suited to the 1850s and '60s, during which Europeans seemed discouraged by the failures of past revolutions and the grim, if profitable, realities of industrialization. During this period, nature philosophies, such as that of Schelling, were deemed overly mystical, and irrelevant to such an empirical age, while philosophy generally, the secular authority for over a century, was largely replaced as the core discipline in German universities by the natural sciences, particularly with the arrival of Darwinism. 2. Nietzsche's Uber-bodhisattva Trained as a classical philologist, Schopenhauer's most influential successor, Friedrich Nietzsche, looked to the Greeks for ideas in his first book, Die Geburt der Trag?die, believing that Greek art held the key to renewed human flourishing</page><page sequence="10">546 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) for a humanity bereft of both the consolations of religious faith and of confidence in reason and science. Much under the influence of Schopenhauer at this early stage of his career (age 26), the two categories of nature that Nietzsche sets up in the work?the Apollonian and the Dionysian?are, however, as Nussbaum points out "up to a point, simply Representation and Will in Greek costume" (Nussbaum 358). While the god Apollo is associated with Platonic or Neo platonic ideas, or what Nietzsche will call "aesthetic Socratism," the image of Dionysus, which Nietzsche characterizes as romantically abandoning the self, is in keeping with characterizations among Hellenistic and Roman writers, such as Arrian and Philostratus, of a Dionysus who went to India, a wild conqueror who learned transcendental philosophy from Brahmin priests. Die Geburt der Trag?die is a book about the sustenance of a healthy society by literature and music, which, for the ancient Greeks, were intertwined as most literature consisted of either lyric poetry or drama in the periods Nietzsche treats. Nussbaum argues, however, that Schopenhauer and Nietzsche's respective positions on the role of art in life are radically different: with Schopenhauer arguing that aesthetics serve no practical need and are directed only toward resignation and denial, and Nietzsche arguing that they serve a practical, life-affirming function. In fact, their positions are not so different. For each of them, aesthetics perform a positive function. For Schopenhauer, they give us a glimpse into Brahman, and for Nietzsche, they render material existence worthwhile. In Nietzsche's preface to the work, dedicated to Richard Wagner, he states its argument unequivocally: "Art is the highest human task, the true metaphysical activity" (Birth of Tragedy 17), and, in particular, the art of mu sic.19 While Nietzsche would later condemn the nineteenth-century German Romanticism of music, his Dionysus, first presented here, is the god of non visual art, as opposed to the god of the plastic arts, Apollo. Nietzsche holds up Apollo reprehensibly as the divine image of the principium individuationis, whereas Dionysus represents music, which is the thing-in-itself: The mystical jubilation of Dionysus breaks the spell of individuation and opens a path to the maternal womb of being. [...] Independently of Greek religious symbols, Schopenhauer assigned to music a totally different character and origin from all the other arts, because it does not, like all the others, represent appearance, but the will directly. It is the metaphysical complement to everything that is physical in the world: the thing-in-itself where all else is appearance, (ibid. 97)20 Nietzsche goes on to add that "we might, therefore, just as well call the world embodied music as embodied will" (ibid. 99).21 At this early stage in his writing, Nietzsche uses the same idealist metaphysical terminology as his predecessors; however, while he will abandon such vocabulary in favor of his own idiosyncratic style, which appears to reject such concerns, he continues to grapple with the</page><page sequence="11">Robert Bruce Cowan 547 relationship between art and human destiny or eschatology. He postulates that the Apollonian and the Dionysian are the product of formative forces "arising directly from nature without the mediation of the human artist" (ibid. 24).22 He argues that in the Dionysian dithyramb, however, man is incited to strain his symbolic faculties to the utmost: he desires to tear asunder the veil of Maya (a term he appears to borrow from Schopenhauer), to sink back into the original oneness of nature by expressing the very essence of nature symbolically. Nietzsche finds, on the other hand, that the deities found in the Dionysian tragedies of Aeschylus do not make one think of asceticism, high intellect, or duty (which he presumably finds in Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and perhaps Schopenhauer), but of luxuriant, triumphant existence, which deifies the good and the bad indifferently. While the Apollonian, with its emphasis on the principium individationis, is already problematic for Nietzsche, he finds that that which brings about its demise, the "aesthetic Socratism" he attributes in tragedy to Euripides, is even more harmful to humanity. Socrates found tragedy useless because it did not convey truth. Nietzsche thus sees the demise of tragedy lying in its infusion by the pragmatic in the purported service of truth. Nietzsche notes, however, that Socrates took up music in prison, asking himself: '"Have I been too ready to view what was unintelligible to me as being devoid of meaning? Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom, after all, from which the logician is excluded? Perhaps art must be seen as the necessary complement of rational discourse?'" (ibid. 90).23 Nevertheless, Nietzsche traces the tradition of rational science, with its concomitant smug optimism, obstacles to the realization of the Dionysian, back to Socrates. In a precursor to his doctrine of "eternal recurrence of the same," Nietzsche asserts that in age after age the same phenomenon recurs of maintaining life through the blandishments of illusion: One man is enthralled by the Socratic zest for knowledge and is persuaded that he can staunch the eternal wound of being with its help. Another is beguiled by the veil of art, which flutters, tantalizing, before his eyes. Yet another is buoyed up by the metaphysical solace that life flows on, inde structible, beneath the whirlpool of appearances. [...] Depending on the proportions of the mixture, we have a culture that is principally Socratic, or artistic, or tragic; or, if historical exemplifications are permitted here, there is either an Alexandrian or a Hellenic or a Brahmanic [buddhaistische] culture. (Ibid. 108-9)24 One might call these three consolations of life the "scientific," the "artistic," and the "metaphysical." While Nietzsche appears to reject metaphysical explanations of any kind of "fundamental reality," he does seem to fall back on metaphysical motifs in discussing how human beings can survive in the world. It almost seems</page><page sequence="12">548 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) as if Nietzsche is attempting to solve Schopenhauer's contradiction between the "pessimistic" system put forth in Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung and his longing for eudemonia found in Parerga und Paralipomena. Nietzsche extols the virtues of Kant and Schopenhauer, who he feels have won a victory over the overly optimistic foundations of logic that form the underpinnings of our culture by establishing a conceptualized form of Dionysian wisdom. Nietzsche sees Schopenhauer persisting in the search for truth; however, he also finds him devoid of hope. Here Nietzsche calls the tragic, lived side of nature that one only gets glimpses of "Buddhistic," but within the same work argues that the Greek chorus is saved by art rather than by a "Buddhistic denial of the will." This contradiction is indicative of the conscious or inadvertent paradoxes to come in his discussions in later works of the "development" of mankind. The evolution of the "Overman" is already foreshadowed here in his as sociations between Dionysus and Prometheus, arguing that the legend of Prometheus is indigenous to the entire community of "Aryan races" and attests to their prevailing talent for profound and tragic vision. "This titanic urge to be the Atlas of all individuals, to bear them on broad shoulders ever farther and higher, is the common bond between the Promethean and the Dionysian forces" (ibid. 65).25 Nietzsche argues that Socratic man has run his course and will be replaced by tragic man, but that it falls on his reader's head to lead the Dionysian procession out of India and into Greece. Here he appears to fall in line with the Hellenistic tendency to envision Dionysus as having become the ecstatic god by going to India. In a passage that sounds eerily prophetic, he states that Sophocles, through the Dionysian character of Oedipus, "tells us that a man who is truly noble is incapable of sin; though every law, every natural order, indeed the entire canon of ethics, perish by his actions, those very actions will create a circle of higher consequences able to found a new world on the ruins of the old" (ibid. 60).26 For Nietzsche, "Socratism" is bent on the extermination of myth, which tragedy uses to create the illusions that unify a culture. He states that, with the death of tragedy, due to the sundering of the irrational sources that nourished it, the Greeks gave up the belief in immortality, and thus the belief in an ideal future, as well as an ideal past. He admonishes his readers to heed the fact that the supposed degeneration of the Greek national character is indicative of the extent to which people, myth, custom, and tragedy are inextricably bound together. The disappearance of tragedy signaled the disappearance of the myths that hold culture together. This argument, however, though appearing to move into the realms of national identities and folk aspects of culture, remains connected to metaphysics, for Nietzsche states at the work's end: "Art is not an imitation of nature but its metaphysical supplement, raised up beside it in order to overcome it" (ibid. 142).27The difference between Schopenhauer and Nietzsche emerges here. Art, for Nietzsche, is not a door to the fundamental, noumenal reality as</page><page sequence="13">Robert Bruce Cowan 549 it was for the Jena Romantics and Schopenhauer; it rather "calls into being the entire world of phenomena" in a powerful way. At the beginning of Die Geburt der Trag?die, Nietzsche uses terms such as "thing-in-itself ' in senses similar to those employed by Kant and Schopenhauer; however, by the end of the book, he has established that tragic art is about man. The idea that art may only be a representation of a reality human beings cannot comprehend, therefore, were it even true, becomes moot. Nietzsche made the transition from philologist to philosopher over the course of the decade that followed Die Geburt der Trag?die, which saw the pub lication of books that focused and extended his critical assessment of various human tendencies and of his contemporaries. He then published Also sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch f?r Alle und Keinen (1883-85), which continues many of the themes found in Die Geburt der Trag?die and further complicates his attempted escape from Schopenhauer's South Asian sources. Here, in what is his most literary work, Nietzsche presents a series of parables that parody the Gospels and hagiography generally, about a prophet who proclaims the death of God and challenges mankind to face its destiny. Zarathustra proclaims the emergence of the " ?bermensch? who will overcome mere man. With the idea of the Overman, Nietzsche seeks to direct mankind's efforts to the emergence of a higher humanity capable of redeeming and justifying human existence, above all through the enrichment of cultural life, by espousing a "Dionysian value-standard" in place of all non-naturalistic modes of valuation. Like Goethe and Hegel, who preferred Persia to India, Nietzsche, after much deliberation, chose a protagonist for his work who was geographically central to the world's major religions. Yet, the lesson of Zarathustra?if there is a single lesson to be gleaned from so contradictory a work?also runs contrary to the teachings of the Zoroastrians, or Parsis as they are now called. Although it is not clear that Zarathustra is supposed to truly resemble Zoroaster, it might be pointed out that Zoroaster preached the final reconciliation of darkness and light, good and evil. In Zarathustra, however, the future victory of a luminous deity is replaced with a human dawn that is close at hand, the sanctioning of "the death of God" releasing all men from the bonds of eschatology. More striking than any vague resemblance to Zoroaster, though, are the ways in which Nietzsche's Zarathustra responds to teachings that appear to issue, if in a very different form, from Gautama Buddha, and, by extension, Schopenhauer: "'Life is only suffering,' others say, and do not lie: see to it, then that you cease! See to it, then, that the life that is only suffering ceases!" (Kaufmann 45)28 His exhortation here is similar to the Buddhist striving to eliminate suffering; however, Nietzsche goes on to iterate an earlier line in his own text and then turn it around: "Everywhere the voice of those who preach death is heard; and the earth is full of those to whom one must preach death. Or ' eternal life'?that is the same to me, if only they pass away quickly" (ibid. 46).29 While he agrees</page><page sequence="14">550 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) with the so-called preachers of death that the multitudes of humanity suffer from what King Lear called the "superflux" of abundance, he peripatetically adds that eternal life is the same to him as death. Nothing that is supposed to come at the end of a mortal life?be it "enlightenment" as a different kind of being, Christian salvation, or simply the pain of death itself?is worth striving for or worrying about. What is important is to change this life: end suffering, end superfluity, be stronger, be higher?here and now. As he does with motifs from the Gospels, Nietzsche thus invokes Hindu and Buddhist ideas and motifs, through Schopenhauer, in order to transform them. His Overman seems to be an extension and metamorphosis of the bodhisattva ideal. A bodhisattva vows to act selflessly to end the suffering of all sentient beings. Zarathustra has taken a similar vow, yet the help he hopes to give human beings?not necessarily to all living creatures?marks not the end of suffering, but a deracinating kick into the next stage of their material evolution. Most schools of Hinduism and Buddhism teach that suffering can end only when one actively transforms oneself, by working up the karmic ladder over the course of many lifetimes, into something that is different from a human being who only reacts to sensory phenomena. Zarathustra does not want to wait through seemingly endless cycles of karmic existence until one is finally ready to make the leap into that beyond, much less to wait for everyone else to do so. He wants to address the now and see results in this lifetime. He wants to help humanity by radically changing the rules and duration of the ontological game itself. He seems to want to become the best bodhisattva, by becoming an "?ber-bodhisattva," stressing a distincdy materialist teleology, one of the goals of which is not material transcendence, but the destruction of inert, lower, culturally-conditioned man. Nietzsche appears to espouse, in other words, a sort of Social Darwinist Buddhism that takes from Hinduism, Buddhism, and Schopenhauer the idea that one deserves one's suffering, but emphasizes that one must "get over" all of the negative ideas and emotions that come with it. Nietzsche's Overman is thus not unlike Rudra-Shiva, the destroyer of ignorance, one of the facets of Shiva to which Dionysus was most likened by classical writers. Zarathustra cannot wait for later developments. He needs to make them happen now, for Nietzsche argues that the world we know is without begin ning or end and things happen repeatedly in the way they always have. In the section that first mentions "eternal recurrence," a notion that Zarathustra can not accept and further fuels his stalwart call to action, he mocks Christianity's patience: " Who is the shepherd into whose throat the snake crawled thus? [...] The shepherd, however, bit as my cry counseled him; he bit with a good bite. Far away he spewed the head of the snake?and he jumped up. No longer shepherd, no longer human?one changed, radiant, laughing!" (ibid. 160).30 Martin Heidegger argues that this doctrine of the "eternal recurrence" is</page><page sequence="15">Robert Bruce Cowan 551 the fundamental aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy (Nietzsche 2: 5-8), a claim that Nietzsche himself also makes in Ecce Homo (published 1908). While I do not agree, it may be argued that this doctrine emerges out of the tradition of Ger man scholarship that has located the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis in Hindu works; however, as stated above, Nietzsche envisions humanity as striving toward an ideal that is not transcendent of materiality, and thus seems more reminiscent of Heraclitus than of Pythagoras. Schopenhauer's search to reconcile transcendence and eudemonia thus becomes for Nietzsche a paradoxi cal pursuit of human perfection, an ethical overcoming of our humanity that is still intelligible by the human being. Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence therefore suffers from the same contradiction as Schopenhauer's conception of the Will. "Nietzsche oscillates between two essentially incompatible versions of the doctrine," states Richard Wolin: First, a voluntarist, "anthropological" version compatible with the theory of the will to power, according to which, the idea of eternal recurrence ex presses a new categorical imperative: live every moment so that you could will that moment over and over again eternally; and second, a more literal, "cosmological" version, according to which the cosmic cycle of recurrence is indifferent to all human willing. (Wolin 52) In contrast to Schopenhauer's figures of the genius, mystic, and ascetic, who achieve glimpses of the fundamental reality when they are temporarily able to transcend material incarnation, Zarathustra is more like Hegel's world-his torical individual or a Byronic hero: a sublime destroyer who remains mortal. While for Schopenhauer the artist Beethoven suffers because it is his lot to have unique insight into the thing-in-itself, for Nietzsche the artist Zarathustra appears to re-create his world, giving it new meaning, for "around the inventors of new values the world revolves: invisibly it revolves" (Thus Spake Zarathustra 52).31 For Schopenhauer, meaning lies outside the realm of representation and creation is, in a sense, a sin, as remarked earlier. For Nietzsche, it is up to human beings to give meaning to the realm of representation. Nietzsche thus creates a sort of meta-metaphysics, or, in Richard Rorty's words, "Nietzsche brought metaphysics to its destined end by inverting Plato, giving Becoming primacy over Being" (Vattimo x). One might say that Nietzsche makes Being into Becoming, ontology into physics. Nietzsche's reflections on the reconceptualization of human beings' relation to the metaphysical world thus points in the direction of a naturalistic episte mology that replaces the conceptions of truth and knowledge of his predeces sors (and hopefully fills the nihilistic void seemingly left by their bankruptcy) with a mode of acting in the world that makes noumena an irrelevant concept. Nietzsche may accept a Kantian view of experience, however, he also takes the</page><page sequence="16">552 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) step of letting this supposedly sole extant form of human experience determine our notions of truth, knowledge, and value. It should be noted, though, that the first occasions on which Nietzsche uses the term "will-to-power," which are in Zarathustra, refer clearly to self-overcoming: "T am that which must always overcome itself" (Thus Spake Zarathustra 115).32 As he feels the only tenable alternative to nihilism must be based upon recognition and affirmation of the world's fundamental character, he posits a general standard of value in which the will-to-power, as the creative transformation of existence, is raised to its highest possible intensity and qualitative expression. Thus art, for Nietzsche, is fundamentally creative rather than cognitive, affords a glimpse of a kind of life that would be lived more fully in this manner, and constitutes a step toward the reunion of ?tman and Brahman. In this way, Nietzsche's mature thought expands upon the idea of the basic connection between art and the justifica tion of life that was his general theme in Die Geburt der Trag?die. Nietzsche's philosophy may therefore be viewed as a blueprint for surviving the impatient twentieth century, in which the pace of "Socratic" change will accelerate beyond the capacity of human adaptation. Conclusion Schopenhauer and Nietzsche each put forth philosophies that embrace the negation of accepted value systems in distinctly different ways. Schopenhauer presents a kind of anti-theodicy?in which good is the necessary counterpart to evil, both as an explanation of will and as a spur to ethical human action. Nietzsche did not devote the time and energy to the study of Sanskrit literature that Schopenhauer did, and, while it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which Nietzsche may or may not have understood Schopenhauer's relationship to his Asian sources, Nietzsche's relationship to the "Indo-German" legacy is just as problematic as his place in the history of post-Enlightenment philosophy. For Nietzsche, the demonic destroyer leads us beyond the thesis by destroying it completely to make way for something wholly new?a new stage of develop ment. This new stage results in a materialist teleology that suffers from the same paradoxes as does Schopenhauer's system, for it cannot reconcile the cyclic existence found in Greek and Hindu religion with the rectilinear Chris tian ideal. Nietzsche argues in Die Geburt der Trag?die that Plato developed an art form deeply akin to the existing forms that he had repudiated at Socrates' behest. Similarly, Nietzsche, in a sense, develops a philosophy akin to those he repudiates?it can only define itself as a negation of metaphysics that ul timately involves man witnessing his own transcendence. Both he and Plato break through laws of stylistic unity, but more importantly, though attempting to delineate a non-metaphysical set of ideas, Nietzsche is unable to abandon?if you'll pardon the phrasing?the presence of metaphysics.</page><page sequence="17">Robert Bruce Cowan 553 1 Nussbaum, 358. 2 See Ursula Nussbaumer, "(Wieder-)Geburt des 'andren' Ideals.

(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987). The Upanishads (literally "to sit down near to" the feet of the guru) form the final portion of the shruti, or revealed part of Vedic teaching, and are the principal basis of Vedanta, the philosophical conclusion derived from the Vedas. Within Ved?nta there are three primary branches of interpretation, based on medieval commentaries that differ over questions of dualism: the school oiAdvaita Ved?nta or "non-dualism," whose main teacher was the eighth-century philosopher Shankara; Vishisht?dvaita- Ved?nta or "qualified non-dualism," whose chief representative is Ramanuja in the twelfth century; and Dvaita-Ved?nta or "dualism," which developed in the thirteenth century under Madhva. 5 Brahman is the impersonal Absolute reality with which one is instructed to attempt to re-ingrate one's individual soul, or ?tman, in texts such as the Upanishads and Bhagavad G?t?. It is not to be confused with Brahma, the god of creation in the Hindu trinity of three gods, or Trim?rti, which includes Shiva and Vishnu, who respectively symbolize the principles of destruction and restoration. 6 "... gar noch der Wohltat der Veden teilhaft geworden, deren uns durch die Upani schaden er?ffneter Zugang in meinen Augen der gr??te Vorzug ist, den dieses noch junge Jahrhundert vor den fr?heren aufzuweisen hat, indem ich vermute, dass der Einfluss der Sanskrit-Literatur nicht weniger tief eingreifen wird als im 15. Jahrhundert die Wiederbelebung der griechischen" (SW1: 11). 7 The Four Noble Truths, the basis of Buddhist teaching, are: (1) all existence is char acterized by suffering, (2) desire is the cause of suffering, (3) elimination of desire can cause the cessation of suffering, and (4) the Eightfold Path leads to this cessation. The third part of Schopenhauer's schema collapses the last two of these truths together. For an explanation of the Eightfold Path, see Schuhmacher and Woerner 98-99. 8 "Das Neue Testament hingegen muss irgendwie indischer Abstammung sein: davon zeugt seine durchaus indische, die Moral in die Askese ?berf?hrende Ethik, sein Pes simismus und sein Avatar" (SWS: 449). 9 "Alles, was im Christentum Wahres ist, findet sich auch im Brahmanismus und Bud dhaismus" (ibid., 450). Schopenhauer uses the term "findet" ("found"), implying that such truths are also to be found there, not necessarily that they originated there. 10Kishan,257. II Schopenhauer uses the term "Idee," translated into English as "Idea," with a capital "I," however, the term "idea" should be taken with caution, since such objects are not creations of a mind, but exist independendy of thought. (This distinction is more nebu</page><page sequence="18">554 German Studies Review 30/3 (2007) lous in German since all nouns in German begin with an initial capital letter.) While "forms" may be closer to the concept Plato was trying to convey, Plato uses the singular Greek terms eidos (type), as well as idea (idea). 12 "... eben auch die indische Lehre voraussetzt, nach welcher der Ursprung der Welt (dieses Samsara der Buddaisten) selbst schon vom ?bel, n?mlich eine s?ndliche Tat des Brahma ist" (SW4: 81). 13 Nussbaum, 184. 14 "Die Musik ist n?mlich eine so unmittelbare Objektivation und [ein] Abbild des ganzen Willens, wie die Welt selbst es ist, ja wie die Ideen es sind, deren vervielf?ltigte Erscheinung die Welt der einzelnen Dinge ausmacht. Die Musik ist also keineswegs gleich den andern K?nsten das Abbild der Ideen; sondern Abbild des Willens selbst, dessen Objektivit?t auch die Ideen sind" (SWl: 359). 15 Schuhmacher and Woerner, 248^-9. 16 "... um eine solche dennoch ausarbeiten zu k?nnen, habe ich daher g?nzlich abgehn m?ssen von dem h?heren metaphysisch-ethischen Standpunkte, zu welchem meine eigentliche Philosophie hinleitet" (SW4: 375). 17 Pinkard, 343. 18 "Wir sehn nun, dass einem solchen Gerechten schon nicht mehr wie dem B?sen das principium individuationis eine absolute Scheidewand ist, dass er nicht wie jener nur seine eigene Willenserscheinung bejaht und alle andern verneint, dass ihm andere nicht blo?e Larven sind, deren Wesen von dem seinigen ganz verschieden ist; sondern durch seine Handlungsweise zeigt er an, dass er sein eigenes Wesen, n?mlich den Willen zum Leben als Ding an sich auch in der fremden, ihm blo? als Vorstellung gegebenen Erscheinung wiedererkennt" (ibid., 1: 504). 19 Der Kunst als der h?chsten Aufgabe und der eigendich metaphysischen T?tigkeit (Werke h IS). 20 "W?hrend unter dem mystischen Jubelruf des Dionysus der Bann der Individuation zersprengt wird und der Weg zu den M?ttern des Seins, zu dem innersten Kern der Dinge offenliegt. [...] dass er, selbst ohne jene Anleitung der hellenischen G?ttersymbolik, der Musik einen verschiedenen Charakter und Ursprung vor allen anderen K?nsten zuerkannte, weil sie nicht, wie jene alle, Abbild der Erscheinung, sondern unmittelbar Abbild des Willens selbst sei und also zu allem Physischen der Welt das Metaphysische, zu aller Erscheinung das Ding an sich darstelle" (ibid., 73-74). 21 Man k?nnte demnach die Welt ebensowohl verk?rperte Musik, als verk?rperten Willen nennen (ibid., 75). 22 "... die aus der Natur selbst, ohne Vermittlung des menschlichen K?nstlers, hervorbre chen" (ibid., 22). 23 "Ist das mir Nichtverst?ndliche doch nicht auch sofort das Unverst?ndige? Viel leicht gibt es ein Reich der Weisheit, aus dem der Logiker verbannt ist? Vielleicht ist die Kunst sogar ein notwendiges Korrelativum und Supplement der Wissenschaft?" (ibid., 68-69). 24 "Diesen fesselt die sokratische Lust des Erkennens und der Wahn, durch dasselbe die ewige Wunde des Daseins heilen zu k?nnen, jenen umstrickt der vor seinen Augen wehende verf?rerische Sch?nheitsschleier der Kunst, jene wiederum der metaphysische Trost, dass under dem Wirbel der Erscheinungen das ewige Leben unzerst?rbar weit erflie?t.
