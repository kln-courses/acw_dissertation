Science does not provide knowledge in this sense but rather pro vides models, representations that are limited in their accuracy, precision, or, most often, both. Truth as we usually think of it is an idealization, one that serves wonderfully in most ordinary applications, but one that can terribly mislead for certain issues in philosophy. This article sketches how this happens for five impor tant issues, thereby showing how philosophical method must take into account the idealized nature of our familiar conception of truth. Keywords: incommensurability, knowledge, laws, modeling, ontology, paradigms, philosophy, pragmatism, truth. 1. Introduction Science provides the sterling best of human representation and knowledge. But what science provides by way of representation and knowledge is, for the most part if not always, in the form of models with shortcomings in accuracy, precision, or, most often, both.1 If scientific representation and knowledge generally suffer such failings, how much more the same must go for human representation and knowledge generally! Let me put the same point "from the other side." If science is really carefully applied common sense, and if the substance of science, for the most part if not always, comes in the form of inexact models, the same must go for the common sense from which it comes. This line of thought turns on a general point that I can sketch, perhaps in a stylized way, as follows. Much of our intellectual culture has taken the attitude that the best and most important of human representation works with statements. Paradigmatically, statements succeed in represent ing things, the traditional thinking goes, by being true. To use the simplest possible case to illustrate what I am calling the traditional attitude, a simple statement, of the form a is P, attributes a property, attached to the 1 The accuracy of a representation is the extent to which it represents its target as it is. By precision I intend freedom from the kind of shortcoming involved in vagueness. I will say that a statement that is both precise and accurate is exact. © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackweli Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="2">258 PAUL TELLER predicate, P, to an object, the referent of a. Such a statement is true just in case the object has the property. Since the property and the object to which it is attributed are taken to be completely determinate things, the truth is taken to be exact. Either the object has the property or it does not. In what I will call the traditional paradigm for truth, we often unreflectively take such statements to be in no way lacking in precision, and when true, in no way lacking in accuracy.2 What I will call the modeling attitude suggests that this traditional paradigm is very misleading. Let us use the expression "Representing things as they are" as a neutral characterization of representational success for representations of any kind. We do appropriately use ''true" to signal success for statements as representing things as they are. But, as I will explain, using "true" in the exact sense in which it is traditionally understood will work only when we take exact truth as a kind of ideali zation. As I said at the start, we should not expect statements to achieve representational success in any way better than models do. Models succeed in representing things as they are always to limited degrees of accuracy. Thus, like maps, we judge models for representational success in terms of their accuracy: a model succeeds in representing things as they are to the extent that, as a representation, it is accurate enough to meet our current needs and interests. If, as I suggested at the outset, the modeling paradigm provides the best of human representation and knowledge, we must have serious reserva tions about the traditional paradigm for truth. Human representations and knowledge that use statements as their vehicle do not take the form of a binary, completely determinate object-has-or-does-not-have-some completely-determinate-property. The best that we generally can have, and all that we need, is sufficient accuracy and likeness to our epistemic targets. This implication of the modeling attitude for how we best think about truth and the kind of considerations that motivate it then have many further consequences. What constitutes (propositional) knowledge? How should we understand the idea of a law of nature? How should we understand pragmatism and the alleged arguments against it? How can we 2 I could fill pages with quotations illustrating this attitude in philosophy. For just one particularly clear-cut example see Braun and Sider 2007, esp. p. 134. Williamson's (1994) widely discussed epistemicism provides another. In the sciences, consider the early modern metaphor of "reading God's Book of Nature." God is perfect, making no errors of impre cision or inaccuracy. For two contemporary quotations from fundamental scientists, see p. 10 of Giere 2006 (though admittedly in the past quarter century there has been considerable consciousness raising among many in the science community). The examples discussed in sections 3 to 6 show indirectly how deeply rooted this attitude is, by showing that problems that otherwise seem intractable immediately dissolve or become sensible, tractable problems as soon as one gives up the attitude. Some readers have noted that in clear cases predication of vague predicates appears to result in truths. As Braun and Sider explain, this is front and center of the problems for truth. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="3">MODELING, TRUTH, AND PHILOSOPHY 259 rationally compare different paradigms? What is it to give an ontology? And, I am sure, there is much more. I aim here to provide a sketch of my thinking about the issues I have just listed, referring you to other papers for further detail. I want to put sketches of these more detailed expositions together in one place to show how the modeling attitude systematically calls for reconsideration of a wide range of issues, treated with a distinctive style of doing philosophy inspired by the sciences. 2. Truth I'll begin by sketching in a bit more detail the repercussions for thinking about truth.3 The motivating remarks suggest that when a statement succeeds in representing things as they are by being true, such success takes a form more like that for modeling than like that characterized in the traditional paradigm. And this is just what we see when we look at simple examples. How should you understand me if I say that John has a height of six feet? That John's height is six feet precisely? No one is precisely six feet tall. Nonetheless, we can use this precise, false statement as if it were true when the discrepancy between John's height characteristics and six feet precisely is small enough not to matter for current concerns. In such situations I will say that the conditions of application for the statement are satisfied. Surely, you will say, it is more natural to interpret my statement that John's height is six feet as saying that John's height is six feet close enough. In suitable circumstances I have no qualms about characterizing this statement as true. I call "John's height is six feet precisely" and "John's height is six feet close enough" semantic alter egos because they get the same representational work done in superficially different ways. The precise statement is, strictly speaking, false, but nonetheless can operate as a truth. The imprecise statement counts as true, but under what condi tions? Exactly under the (imprecisely specified) conditions in which the exact statement functions as a truth. Saying that John's height is six feet ("close enough" being understood) can be reinterpreted as a way of saying that John's height is six feet precisely is true enough. That such a statement is true enough provides just the analogy I have in mind to a model being successful by providing sufficient similarity with its representational target. I can characterize my example in a slightly different way. We can think of the statement that John's height is six feet precisely as an idealization, a very useful one as long is it is not misunderstood. Thinking this way about statements generally motivates thinking about traditional truth as an idealization. If by an unqualified truth we mean one that is both completely precise in its statement and completely accurate in its content, 3 Much more detail is provided in my 2008a, my 2011, and my article in preparation. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="4">260 PAUL TELLER an unqualified truth is an idealization that works smoothly when the real state of affairs is like the idealized description in ways and to degrees that satisfy our current interests. Very like representational success for models. In "Two Models of Truth" (2011) and "Modeling Truth" (in prepa ration) I argue that, with possible exceptions in finite mathematics, what goes for this example goes for all statements: with the mentioned exception, none of our statements achieves perfect precision and perfect accuracy.4 Because I am thinking of traditional truth as a kind of idealization, am I going to urge that we should abandon it for some less idealized way of thinking about representational success for statements? Not at all! Any such suggestion reflects familiar, but misguided, ways of thinking about paradigm change. In the Kuhnian tradition one supposes that when we become dissatisfied with a "paradigm"—say, because we have come to realize that it is "only an idealization"—we abandon it for some new paradigm that we now see as free from the flaws of the old. But this is not at all what happens when we realize that a very successful way of thinking about the world nonetheless involves unrealistic idealizations. We have hardly abandoned Newtonian mechanics because, from the point of view of quantum mechanics and relatively, we now see it as an idealized account. Instead we seek to understand the success of the old, and where it was successful, generally we continue to use it just as before, very much for explanation as well as prediction. I want to say the same kind of thing about the traditional idea of truth. For a wide range of purposes it will continue, in analogy to the continued use of Newtonian mechanics, as the best way of thinking about how statements apply to the world. First, this idea provides the right idealiza tion to use within formal semantics to study questions about the structure of language. More broadly, in informal contexts, as long as discrepancies result in no problems in the context at hand, agents don't bother with worries about presumed sufficient precision and accuracy. Of course, agents generally don't worry about "conceptions of truth." But when we theorize about such situations in which shortfalls in precision and accu racy are unproblematically ignored, the traditional conception of truth provides an excellent modeling tool.5 However, when idealizations break down but we persist in ignoring them we get into all kinds of trouble. For example, in a wide range of problems physicists characterize extended objects as point particles. Now imagine that, on observing this practice, philosophers struggled to 4 Lack of room does not here permit consideration of the relevance of the current vagueness literature. This is addressed in Teller in preparation, which also briefly compares Millgram's (2009) very different approach to these issues. 5 In Teller in preparation I argue this in more detail and, in particular, that this circum stance naturally gives rise to the illusion that the traditional conception of truth is uniquely applicable. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="5">MODELING, TRUTH, AND PHILOSOPHY 261 understand how physical objects could be point particles when they seem so extended! I'll call this "the point particle disaster." I suggest that certain general and philosophically important issues are just such point particle disasters. For most applications, treating truth as on the traditional model provides by far the best way of thinking about representational success for propositional statements. But there are special issues for which doing so badly misleads us, sometimes generating intractable, unsolvable, unreal problems. 3. Provisional Knowledge6 Propositional knowledge requires truth. But all our theories in physics are in fact false. Does physics, then, provide no theoretical knowledge? There is an intriguing clue for the foregoing puzzle about knowledge that I have never seen mentioned in the epistemology literature. On a history test Peter is asked to tell when Columbus first reached the so-called New World. He writes down, "Late fifteenth century." He gets no credit for his answer. Why not? Conventionally, to know the date on a history test requires knowing the year but not a more exact date, unless something of historical importance turns on it. Here is another example. Mary is putting together an electronic circuit. She needs to know the resistance of a resistor. She knows the color-coding system. The tolerance band is silver—which means that the number indi cated by the other color bands can be counted on to be right within 10 percent. Question: Does Mary know the resistance of the resistor? Answer: It depends. If a 10 percent tolerance is good enough for Mary's project, she knows the resistance. If the project requires a more exact tolerance, she does not. Our observations about truth apply to help us make sense of such considerations. Propositional knowledge, we are told, requires truth. But the traditional paradigm of truth is an idealization. People have knowl edge, but they never achieve the idealization of truth, traditionally con ceived. So knowledge—any sort of propositional knowledge that people can actually have—must not be understood in terms of the traditional paradigm of truth. The sensible alternative is for knowledge to require truth in the sense of the modeler's paradigm. If we reconfigure our under standing of propositional knowledge as what is known well enough—as "advanced as adequate"—idealization in science no longer stands in the way of knowledge attributions, and a vast range of expertise in physics (and throughout science) is reinstated as knowledge it its own right. As a bonus we get a nice way to make sense of the two examples above. 6 For more detail on provisional knowledge see my 2009. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="6">262 PAUL TELLER Thinking of knowledge in this way requires that we relativize knowl edge to some relevant standards of required precision and accuracy.7 In a specific problem situation, whether prepositional expertise counts as knowledge will depend, as in Mary's case, on whether the agent knows what is in question to a level of precision and accuracy required for the problem to hand. Beyond the context of a specific problem, often there would appear to be some "default" level of required precision. This often would appear to be a matter of convention that requires, and thereby helps to sustain, the level of precision that is generally available in the social setting. Here are two more examples that support the last claim. Pop quiz: Do you know the name of the famous philosopher who tried to prove the existence of the external world by referring to his own hands? You show that you know the name if you can come up with "G. E. Moore." You know the answer to the question even if you do not know the full name, "George Edward Moore." Or again, generally physicists count as knowing the fine structure constant if they can specify it as 1/137 even though its value has been estimated, to eight more decimal places, as 1/137.03599967. There is also a worry here. If what I propose is sound, there will be a healthy sense in which we can say that people in earlier times did know things that we now know to be false. But, surely! No one ever knew that the earth was flat, or that at the Salem witch trials the prosecutors knew that the defendants were witches. One routinely hears such examples intended to ridicule the claim that knowledge can be relatived to a social setting in any way. On the other hand, if we do not accept the relativiza tion that I propose it would appear that we now know much less than we take ourselves to know. I think that my proposed relativization accommodates examples like the two I have given, and in just the right way. Did people before Colum bus generally know that the earth was flat? The question is misleadingly simple. Those with interest in long-range navigation, with concerns about where one might get to, certainly did not know. But consider commoners, thinking only about their immediate environs and for whom the expres sion "the earth" probably had no further application. With that referent and with those interests, they did know that the earth is flat, in the same 7 The reader must carefully note that while the view being proposed here is a contextualist view, it is entirely different from the contextualist epistemic theses currently being debated in the literature. Those theses all have to do with possible contextual dependence in the standards of justification required for knowledge. The present proposal concerns contextual dependence on the precision required for satisfying the requirement of truth. Starting with the outline according to which knowledge is some kind of true justified belief, current contextualist accounts all address the justification component. I am here observing that there is a parallel contextualist issue about the truth component of knowledge. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="7">MODELING, TRUTH, AND PHILOSOPHY 263 sense that we know that Kansas is flat. For those with no conception of the earth "as a whole," the question of whether the earth as a whole was flat or not had no application. The case of the Salem "witches" works out just the opposite way. Those who brought the accusations of witchcraft had lots of concerns relative to which the accused were in no way "witchy enough." Objectively, the accusers had concerns about knowing the real causes of the misfortunes that were blamed on the "witches." In addition, these people had concerns about justice—the trials were intended to be real, not show trials. So, relative to the operative standards and concerns of the day the attributions of witchcraft were anything but accurate. Thinking that the accused indi viduals were witches was, relative to those concerns, an awful mistake. I propose to signal such considerations by saying that all propositional knowledge is provisional. The intended reservation is not that knowledge is provisional with respect to the evidence, not a proviso that, maybe, the evidence that supports a knowledge claim might turn out to be misleading or inadequate. If we turn out to be wrong about the evidence, then what we counted as knowledge never was so. Rather, the proviso concerns the standards of precision and accuracy that are in play in the context of the proffered knowledge. When these standards become more exacting, new instances of knowledge must meet the more exacting standards. But the prior provisional knowledge does not thereby cease to have been knowl edge in having met the prior standards. I propose to say that the knowl edge we have now is provisional is precisely to acknowledge the eventuality that more exacting standards may come into play. In this sense (and exceptions in mathematics aside), humanly accessible knowledge is, in science, and I believe always, provisional. 4. The Law Idealization8 Natural laws provide an attractive candidate for perfectly precise and exceptionless truths. Our culture has so regarded them for centuries. The material for natural laws certainly seems to hand. We take ourselves to identify completely determinate properties, the relations among which provide the candidates for natural laws. But if natural laws are understood as being both completely precise and completely accurate, today we have no natural laws. We know that the laws of quantum field theory and general relativity involve idealizations. The velocity of light is the constant c (which of course we do not know precisely)—but only in a vacuum, and there are no perfect vacua. Con servation laws are tied to symmetries, but the symmetries are themselves idealizations. And so on. Perhaps in the limit of inquiry we will find natural laws, but we don't have any today. 8 The following is a sketch of the material to be found in my 2004a. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="8">264 PAUL TELLER We do know a great many regularities, but these always have excep tions. The regularities we know are all ceteris paribus laws.9 Today there is widespread agreement that, furthermore, we can never explicitly fill in all the exceptions to any ceteris paribus generalization. We can always formulate conditions of application, but they will never be complete. Moreover, the explicit formulation of conditions will themselves never be completely precise. There are no hard and fast rules for application. In the end application of ceteris paribus laws—and so all generalizations that we know—will depend to some extent or other on the exercise of skills. The same sorts of things go for the application of models generally. Model application cannot be formulated in hard and fast rules that could, as it were, be fed into a computer. Indeed, we can see ceteris paribus laws as "little models." The regularities are true in these little models.10 But they have to be applied to the world, and application is never a matter of rote. Most usually these problems of application go unmentioned. We think of the generalizations as laws in the traditional sense, leaving it to unar ticulated skills to cover the vicissitudes of application. This observation now suggests a sensible way of thinking of the traditional notion of natural laws: they are just the ceteris paribus laws, the little models, from which we have idealized away the problems of application. In many respects such idealization is harmless, and often very useful. But when we forget that "natural laws" are idealizations, pande monium ensues. We labor to understand the idea of a natural law. We struggle to understand whether studies such as biology and the social sciences are "real sciences," since they appear to have no "real" laws such as we imagine provide the underpinning of physics as a science. In retro spect, the search for universally applicable, exact natural laws, the efforts to understand the concept, and the demand that they provide the gold standard for science badly distort our understanding of the scientific enterprise. 5. Pragmatism Discussing pragmatism constitutes a natural part of the larger project because the modelers' approach to truth has clear affinities with pragma tism. If pragmatism is all wrong, the modelers' approach likewise becomes suspect. But the standard objection to any nonepistemic version of prag matism is an artifact of the truth idealization. We need to do a little untangling to see why. 9 Just as Nancy Cartwright has been insisting since at least 1983, in places far too numerous to cite. 10 Just as Giere argues that, generally, laws are only literally true, and there true by definition or construction, of the models that instantiate them. See, for example, Giere 1999, 92. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="9">MODELING, TRUTH, AND PHILOSOPHY 265 One usually articulates pragmatism as a program with one of these two slogans: Pragmatism 1: To be true is to be assertable with warrant. Pragmatism 2: To be true is to work (when believed). These are distinct views that are sometimes conflated. How the conflation occurs is an interesting interpretive question, addressed below. As for pragmatism 1, lots of things are assertable with warrant and aren't true, aren't true in either the traditional or the modelers' ways of thinking about truth. So we reject pragmatism 1. Most also reject pragmatism 2, because of the problem of compensat ing errors: given my mistaken belief that my size 9 feet are size 10, the mistaken belief that these size 9 shoes are size 10 works just fine." To untangle what is going on with pragmatism 2 we need first to disambiguate it by distinguishing between two ways of understanding "to work." Often people hear "to work" as "having been found to work." So, for example, what, on this reading, is involved when I find that my belief that all ravens are black "works"? Just that the first raven I find is black, and the second, and the third. . . . More broadly, to have been found to work is just induction writ large—when we find that a statement "works," we take that to be evidence for it. In other words, we have here an epistemic reading of "to work," on which reading pragmatism 2 is just a restatement of pragmatism 1, which we have rejected. (This provides some insight into how the conflation of pragmatisms 1 and 2 occurs.) But from the epistemic reading we can distinguish an objective reading of "to work." For example, my computer may objectively work just fine, in the sense of being in perfectly good working order, so that when properly used it will provide the expected results. And this despite my erroneously thinking that it doesn't work, that it is broken, because, being a computer dunce, I can't get it to work for me. Objectively, the computer is in good working order despite the fact that I don't know how to use it. The objective reading of pragmatism 2 understands "to work" in this way. Once we have isolated pragmatism 2 in the objective sense from the epistemic pragmatism 1 and its reformulation with the slogan of pragma tism 2, we can see the objection of compensating errors as an artifact of the traditional paradigm of truth, and the objection is called into question when we substitute the modelers' way of thinking about truth. The mod elers' slogan is "To be true is to be true enough." So what will be relevant to the modeler's slogan will not be working, but working well enough. Substituting this correction into the pragmatists' "To be true is to work," 11 Usually this kind of worry is expressed by saying things such as that wishful thinking may work in lots of ways, but that doesn't make true what is wished to be true. In such cases "compensating errors" are the fortuitous circumstances that account for the efficacy of false statements wished to be true. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="10">266 PAUL TELLER we get a revised pragmatist slogan, the "modelers' pragmatism": "To be true enough is to work well enough." Everything will now turn on the "enough." Will the mistaken statement that these size 9 shoes are size 10 work well enough? Well, yes, but only for me, and only in the extraordinarily narrow case in which I am buying shoes and mistakenly believe that my size 9 feet are size 10. The erroneous statement about the shoes won't work for much for me, and works not at all for others. Truth requires much more of "working well enough." When we evaluate a statement as true, suppressing the "enough," we intend that the statement is true enough so that discrepancies won't matter for any concern that is at all likely to come up. And since truth is a deeply social concept, operating as the stamp of reliability to publicize to others, we have to understand the "at all likely to come up" as applying to the contextually determined community. This consideration eliminates the shoe example, and all similar ones, as purported counterexamples. The pragmatist connection is not one that I have yet considered in detail, and clearly there is a great deal of work still to be done in refining the suggestions I am making. But already I have identified a way of thinking about pragmatism about truth that is a perfectly nonepistemic, objective notion and that supports a good prima facie argument against the objection from compensating errors. Lots of statements that are not, strictly speaking and in the traditional sense, true, nonetheless are true (enough), are statements that we unproblematicaly and appropriately evaluate as true.12 Pragmatism, or at least its plausibility, has been another casualty of the failure to appreciate that the traditional idea of truth is an idealization. 6. Incommensurability and Paradigm Change13 According to the Kuhnian tradition, paradigms provide distinctive con ceptual frameworks in terms of which we approach the world. To apply a paradigm to a problem, one must choose a suitable paradigm, often from alternatives that, if they don't conflict outright, at least provide incom mensurable resources. But how to choose? Since each paradigm can only be understood on its own terms, paradigms cannot be rationally com pared. In particular, since the evidence for the claims of a paradigm must be understood from within the paradigm, what counts as evidence for one has no purchase on any other. There looks to be no possibility of rational comparison of paradigms. Kuhn himself did qualify this conclusion in one respect. He agreed that we compare paradigms in terms of the "epistemic virtues," such as 12 People who know a little about Pierce and Dewey tell me that this was all perfectly clear to them. 13 For much more detail see my 2008b. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="11">MODELING, TRUTH, AND PHILOSOPHY 267 accuracy, simplicity, fruitfulness, explanatory power, and consistency. But, he noted, since the balance among these is a matter of personal value judgment, differential satisfaction of the individual epistemic virtues pro vides no objectively fixed rational mandate for choice among paradigms.14 1 would add that, with the possible exception of consistency, the virtues themselves embody personal values. Accuracy and simplicity in which respects? What counts as more fruitful than what? What kind of explana tion? Kuhn's principles for paradigm choice provide no help with the problem of objective rational grounds for choosing among paradigms. There is a huge literature addressing the issue of rational paradigm change, with some writers concluding, so much the worse for one or another part of Kuhn's account of paradigms, and others concluding, so much the worse for rationality. There is no need to sweat this painful choice. The opposition is an artifact of the traditional idea of truth. There is a crucial step in the whole line of argument that, as far as I can see, has been taken for granted by everyone: that the paradigms compete. But why are they seen as competing? How are they taken to compete? I suggest that the appearance of competition among paradigms arises as a result of thinking that from within each paradigm its adherents see their paradigm as the true view of the world, true in the traditional sense. Then alternative paradigms concerning a whole subject matter, for example motion, take on the status of alternative candidate truths about that subject matter, among which one must make a choice. But since the choices are, at best, on the basis of value-laden considerations, there can be no impersonal, objective basis for rational choice. All this takes on an entirely different look as soon as we take science to be in the business of fashioning never completely exact models instead of being in the business of uncovering exact truths. Inexact models have a broad spectrum of virtues. Some will be accurate in some respects, others in other respects. For accuracy in one respect, models will differ both in the accuracy they provide in that respect and in the labor needed to extract representations at a given level of accuracy. Models will be fruitful in different ways. They will provide different kinds of explanation. Choices among all of these are value-laden. However, once the values are set, often there will be an objectively correct evaluation of the extent to which one or another modeling approach will achieve the values in question. In short, once we appreciate that paradigms are organons for constructing (never completely exact) models and we remember that values are rationally involved in model choice, we can see that choice among paradigms may sensibly be evaluated in terms of instrumental rationality. This already resolves the dilemma about rational paradigm choice. Further, when we remember that paradigms function not as sources for truths, traditionally conceived, but as model-building systems, the whole 14 See my 2008b for many references. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="12">268 PAUL TELLER idea of paradigm change takes on an entirely new cast. In a leading example, Kuhnians see the paradigm of Newtonian mechanics as having been replaced by quantum and relativistic mechanics. But if Newtonian mechanics has been replaced, how is it that we keep using it? Newtonian mechanics is the first theory we teach students. It is the theory of choice for a wide range of problems. Many physicists today spend their whole careers further articulating the Newtonian paradigm. Once more we have an illusion bred from thinking of science as being in the traditional, exact-truth business. On learning the quantum mechani cal and relativistic facts we leaned that Newtonian mechanics was false, didn't we? And as false, it is to be abandoned. But how so when we know just as well that quantum field theory and general relativity are themselves false? The metaphor of abandoned theories littering the royal road to truth terribly mischaracterizes the scientific enterprise. To be sure, there are many theories that have been entirely supplanted by new ones that do better than the old ones did for everything that we still care about. But in important cases theories, such as Newtonian mechan ics, provided extraordinarily powerful approaches to both prediction and explanation. The usefulness of such theories has not been displaced by new theories. We retain the older theories precisely because, and insofar as, they remain powerful tools in achieving both our practical and our intellectual objectives. For example, special relativity gets many things more accurately than Newtonian mechanics—but generally at a much higher calculational cost. What is more important to you, the additional accuracy or the calcula tional ease? Especially when the extra accuracy does not bear on anything of interest to us? And this is not just a matter of predictive utility of our theories. Often, the theory that is easier to apply provides a better window on the world through which limited humans can look. General relativity has not made the Newtonian explanation of the terrestrial tides obsolete. Modelers already know these considerations about the relation between theories such as Newtonian mechanics and the theory of relativ ity. The point here is that others have missed or completely mischaracter ized these considerations, and that neglecting the point that the traditional way of thinking about truth is an idealization has been at least one important source for convulsions in the Kuhnian tradition. 6. Ontology15 What things are there in the world, and what are they like? The attitude that I will call "fundamentalism" holds that answers to these questions are provided by fundamental physics—quantum field theory and general relativity. The outdated models of physics, things such as continuum 15 This section extends material taken from my 2004b and 2008b, sec. 7. ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="13">MODELING, TRUTH, AND PHILOSOPHY 269 hydrodynamics and ray optics and deliberate idealizations such as point particles, survive only as useful fictions, as practical crutches. They really do not give us the furniture of the world.16 What drives this attitude? There is no such thing as a continuous fluid. There are no point particles. Presumably we draw the conclusion that there are no such things because descriptions of such are idealizations and idealizations are false to reality. Perhaps the tacit standard is that being idealized disqualifies an account from qualifying as telling us what there really is and what existing things are like. This criterion fails both when we look "down" and when we look "up." Looking down the claimed hierarchy of theory, all our current fundamen tal theories in physics themselves suffer extreme idealization. The quanta of quantum field theory are an artifact of describing space-time as flat. General relativity fails because it isn't quantized.17 If merely being ideal ized provides a standard for disqualification, our fundamental theories are no better a source for telling us what there is than the many other idealized but still very useful modeling approaches. If all our accounts in physics are idealized, are we driven to some kind of instrumentalism according to which our theoretical representations are just convenient tools for making predictions about the real things that we represent without idealization?18 Looking upward we see that this is not a viable position. Generally, our nontheoretical or pretheoretical represen tations suffer idealization just as thoroughly as do our representations in physics (see my 2008b, sec. 7). Suppose I hold up a clear sample of a red piece of paper and say, "This piece of paper is red." Surely I have described an objective fact about the world not contaminated with idealization in any way. No! I take it that we are making the same claim as made by people in such a situation who do not know anything about the complexities of color. In representing the piece of paper as red we attribute a nonrelational color property to the paper. But there is no such nonrelational property. Color involves a complex relation among the perceiver, the object per ceived, and the immediate environment; our pretheoretical color attri butions involve severe idealization.19 And if so with color, so with all "secondary qualities." 16 For a robust contemporary expression of this attitude, see Sklar 2003. 17 See my 2004b, 432-33 and 436-37, for more detail. IS It would appear that science does include a great many unqualified truths, such as: Water is H20. Cells have nuclei. Elsewhere I argue that unqualified truth is purchased by imprecision in representation, and that imprecision and inaccuracy should be seen as "duals" that really play the same role in representation, as I briefly indicated with the description of semantic alter egos in section 2. Thus I take what I say here to apply very broadly in science. See my 2011 and my article in preparation.

Think again of the red piece of paper. In so representing the facts in that situation, we represent them as involving an identity-bearing object, the piece of paper. Idealization once more! We idealize away the indeter minate temporal and spatial boundaries of the "object." Qualitatively, all our successful exemplars of knowledge and understanding of what things there are and what they are like are in the same idealized boat. In particular, if we accept that our everyday perceptual experience provides veridical information about what things there are and what they are like, we must again reject the attitude that merely being idealized disqualifies a representation from giving us such information. Let's try another tack for making sense of the claimed exclusive role of fundamental theory in providing real knowledge of what things there are and what they are like. Perhaps fundamental theories can command this role because, though themselves idealized, they provide our most accurate account of what there really is. I see two problems with any such claim. First, "more accurate than" is always more accurate than in one or another specific respect. Because fundamental theories are more accurate than other idealizations when it comes to certain features of central sci entific interest, people jump to the conclusion that they are more accurate in all respects. This conclusion is never argued, and at least sometimes when one description is more accurate than another in one respect, the first will be less accurate in some other respect.20 However, even where fundamental theory does in principle provide more accurate information than other accounts, fundamental theory most usually does not thereby succeed in telling us what things there are and what they are like, insofar as such theory fails to be humanly applicable to the questions in which we are interested. With Putnam's (1975) old example, fundamental theory does not provide humanly accessible under standing of why the round peg will not go through the square hole. Fundamental theory is not irrelevant to this question, as it may help us to understand why the materials involved are approximately rigid. But to get the full answer from conventional quantum theory we would have to set up a Schrodinger equation with 1025 to 1027 variables, find the solution, and then somehow make sense of it. We would not even know how to set up the problem using quantum field theory. The same goes generally for humanly accessible information. Switching to a more substantive 20 As shown by Peter Smith (1998, 269-72), elaborating on examples originally suggested by David Miller. Smith takes the position that most of these "respects" can be ignored because they are not "physically significant." But it is open to debate whether "physically significant" is an absolute notion or has to be understood as "physically significant to us." In my 2001, 402-6,1 show by example that what appears to be "significant" may be dependent on our circumstances. I conjecture that this sort of consideration can be extended very broadly. © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="15">MODELING, TRUTH, AND PHILOSOPHY 271 example, to predict the behavior and understand the fluid properties of water we have no recourse other than the highly idealized continuum hydrodynamics. And similarly for almost all our understanding of the furniture of the universe. Finally, some will claim that at least fundamental theory tells us what the ultimate constituents are of physical objects. They are atoms—no, quarks—no, more exactly, field quanta—but about idealized field quanta we know very little beyond how they behave in simple collision experi ments. In particular, we know very little about how idealized field quanta might figure in the bound states needed for our idealized atoms, molecules, and the more familiar stuff of our experience. Moreover, field quanta are not "constituents" in any ordinary sense. To take quantum field theory to give us the "ultimate constituents of matter" both bends the idea of constituent beyond recognition and ignores the many layers of idealiza tion that we would require if we could get from quantum field theory to bulk matter at all. We need alternative ways of understanding human knowledge of the furniture of the universe. If we look elsewhere, we see that we have such ways already and need only put them into play. When not caught up in philosophy, we have much more sensible standards for what will give us knowledge of what things there are and what they are like. Maps, as with so much of the world of modeling, provide an exemplar: maps involve all kinds of simplifications and distortion. But if you know how to read maps, they give abundant veridical information—knowledge—about features of the landscape and their characteristics. Here is a more detailed analogy, a little model, if you will, of what is involved in our always growing understanding of our world. Let's begin with our practical knowledge of how we use our desk computers. In explaining to a child how these computers work we might begin with an anthropomorphic metaphor involving little people performing simple operations and sending messages back and forth. We explain more robustly, one aspect of the larger question, when we start to sketch the kinds of programs that the machine uses, gradually filling in the account in more detail. In so doing we are following what Cummins (1975) calls the analytic explanatory strategy, explaining the behavior and capacities of the whole in terms of the programmed, organized behavior and capaci ties of parts. When we do this by describing a program we are describing the component capacities in the abstract. But how are those capacities realized? We can attack such questions with accounts of the hardware, starting, as we did with the software, with relatively superficial descrip tions and progressively getting more detailed, both with respect to the integration of the parts and with respect to the mechanisms that charac terize how the parts themselves behave. At each stage we both analyze capacities of parts and analyze the ways in which these component capacities are organized. © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="16">272 PAUL TELLER There are several things that I want to emphasize with this analogy. First, a prejudice that goes back to the scientific revolution and before, one may be tempted to suppose that there is a bottom level and that we can know it exactly. Such knowledge would provide the exact ontology of the fundamental components that would suffice for understanding all the things composed from these. But even that there is such a bottom level is an assumption for which there is, as far as I can see, no support. Second, I have been at pains to stress that at each stage we provide streamlined, idealized characterizations, characterizations that illuminate what we are interested in, illuminate them more clearly on the strength of simplifying distortions that affect only what, at the moment, we care about less or not at all. And I have been at pains to stress that as we go into more and more detail, both about parts and about interrelations among parts, the complexities in effect put blinders on us. Things become so complicated and we are so much hostage to the idealizations involved in the immediate topic that we can't begin to see at one go how it all fits together. In the computer analogy, it will be humanly impossible to see the behavior of the whole in terms of what we have in view when focusing on the details of the assembly code. Nor can we see the physical aspects of gross behavior when focused on what physically happens at the level of electron flow. Indeed, in many instances, the idealizations needed at one or another level probably make it impossible to put back together even moderately extensive chucks of the analysis. But no matter! These limitations do not compromise the very extensive knowledge and understanding that we do have of the behavior at many levels and of the effects of all sorts of cross-cutting integration. Such multifaceted patterns of understanding clearly provide an enormous amount of real information about the structure both of the natural world and of the artifacts that we construct. As with the simple example of the map, imperfections and limitations do not invalidate the enormous under standing we have assembled of how things work. Looking for a fixed, final, and exact ontology of the natural world is not a feasible objective today or anytime in the foreseeable future. It is sheer speculation to suppose that it should be possible eventually, or even possible "in principle." But a photograph need not be in perfect focus (if such a thing were possible) to count as a real picture of its target, provid ing us with real information about what its target is like. In analogy, science—and human knowledge generally—give to us a vast plurality of representative tools, none of which works with both complete precision and complete accuracy. But a great many of the resulting representations, like not perfectly focused photographs, do give us a real cognitive grip on real things. The modeling attitude brings us to a much more accurate model than does the traditional account of what it is to understand what things there are and what they are like. © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="17">MODELING, TRUTH, AND PHILOSOPHY 273 7. Conclusion The traditional quest for exact truths, truths that are both perfectly precise and perfectly accurate, is a fool's errand. With possible exceptions in finite mathematics, exact truths are not something that we have achieved in any respect or in any way. More important, exact truths are not something that we need. Accounts that are not both completely accurate and com pletely precise, in the spirit of the modeling attitude, richly satisfy both our practical needs and our intellectual cravings. This is not in any way to suggest that we should stop thinking in terms of exact truths. To insist on noting known and possible inaccuracies would be, in almost every instance, a pointless distraction. But, for certain special yet important interpretive issues, when we neglect the point that the traditional paradigm for thinking about truth is an idealization, we create intractable, unreal pseudo-problems.
