<plain_text><page sequence="1">BURCHFIELD'S SEASONS Charles Burchfield has the distinction of being one of the most articulate con- temporary artists. Strictly speaking (he says), I have no over- all aim, in the sense that I am trying to invent a new language or have before me an ideal of representation towards which I am struggling, my subjects being merely convenient vehicles for the working out of this ideal. Stating it as simply as I can, I may say that I am one who finds himself in an incredibly interesting world, and my chief concern is to record as many of my impressions as possible, in the simplest and most forthright manner.' Burchfield's interesting world has been limited almost entirely to the vicinity of his native state of Ohio and the neighbor- hood of Buffalo, New York. It should be pointed out that in spite of the limited geographical area of his work, Burchfield should not be strictly defined as a region- alist. Although his paintings have the feeling of certain places, they have univer- sal qualities of design and mood that raise them far above the production of the self- styled regionalist painters. As Burchfield himself has said, "The American scene has no more significance than any other sub- ject matter. While I feel strongly the per- sonality of a given scene, my chief aim in painting it is the expression of a com- pletely personal mood."' 2 155</page><page sequence="2">BURCHFIELD'S SEASONS One is also struck by his statement, So many things about painting, the real things, are intangible or of an abstract nature, difficult to express in definite terms, and in addition, the mental proc- esses of an artist are more or less sub- conscious; he does not alwrays knowv why he does things in a certain way.3 The artist goes on to say that the best he can do to explain his works is to state what he thinks he is trying to do. The critic in a sense is at an even greater disadvantage, since he obviously cannot relive the sub- conscious creative operation by which the painter produced his picture. The best service that the critic can perform is to explain in perfectly rational terms what he believes the artist's aim to have been through an intuitive projection of himself into the mood of the picture and thereby into the mood of its creator. Every student of connoisseurship of modern paintings must be aware of the unfortunate tendency to read meanings into pictures where none is intended and of the incomprehensible jargon that has been specially devised to describe works of art. The result has been to make confusion the more confounding. Charles Burchfield has always been as direct and forthright in the expression of his aims as he has been in the making of pictures. Thus, when the painter says, "I am one who finds himself in an incredibly interesting world, and my chief concern is to record as many of my impressions as possible, in the simplest and most forth- right manner," little remains for the critic except to evaluate how a certain painting is representative of a certain phase of the artist's development; and even in this, as we shall see, he is happily anticipated by Burchfield's own opinions on his artistic growth. The Fogg Museum is fortunate to have in its collection three watercolors that are representative of three distinct periods and aspects of Burchfield's painting. The earliest of these watercolors is signed "C. Burchfield, 1916" and is entitled August Sunlight. Through a clump of sunflowers in the foreground is seen a group of houses which in turn are silhouetted against a screen of trees. This watercolor belongs to a period when Burchfield was living in virtual isolation in Salem, Ohio. This was the most romantic, or some pre- fer to call it the most expressionistic, chapter in the artist's life when he was largely concerned with the nostalgic evo- cation of the magical world of the child's imagination. Although the painting in the Fogg collection lacks those eerie distor- tions of natural forms, which in such pic- tures as the Night Wind are calculated to suggest pictorially the child's terror of unknown forces, the terms of its pictorial expression are essentially the same, clearly demarcated areas of flat colors and the essential elements in the composition ar- ranged in a series of flat planes that recede like the "flies" in stage scenery. The August Sunlight belongs to the period before Burchfield evolved that personal language of eerie expressionistic symbols calculated to recreate the sensa- tions and emotions of childhood. It might almost have been painted the same day as the tatterdemalion sunflowers in the Rogues' Gallery in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.5 The whole group of watercolors done in 1916 might be called "decorative landscapes," a title actually applied by the artist, to two of the known examples. However, in all of them there is something beyond mere decoration to personify both glare and wilting heat in the grotesque silhouettes of plants and buildings. August Sunlight was painted in the ar- tist's back yard at Salem, Ohio, in the summer of i9i6. Mr. Burchfield himself, describing this painting, writes: It had been a dry suimmer, plants wvere prematurely old and rather dryed and bleached out. The brilliant sunlight on them only made them seem whiter, es- pecially since, if you came from the darker interior of the house, as I did, and your unaccustomed eyes received the full im- pact of glittering light. This is the im- pression I tried to give, that first glorious 156</page><page sequence="3">BURCHFIELD'S SEASONS moment. The effect of all this light made the various buiildings seem much blacker by contrast.6 It only remains to make a few notes on the technical means by which the artist has achieved his dazzling effect of the wilt- ing heat of the summer sun. Large areas of the foliage pattern are left white to give at once the effect of brilliance as though the objects were outlined in a kind of penumbra of light and to suggest how these plant forms have almost been bleached by the rays of the August sun. The tremendous effect of glare that afflicts the eyes when one emerges from cool in- terior darkness into the blinding noonday is enhanced by leaving the roofs com- pletely white except for the incandescent blue line of the chimney shadows. In various areas on the picture are penciled color notes, such as "YG &amp; White," "OY &amp; YG," which seem a clear indication that the artist himself had to retire from the wilting heat after completing his sketch. The only suggestion of the kind of ex- pressionistic symbolism that we associate with this phase of Burchfield's career is to be found in the serrated outline of the foliage in the background plane which seems intended to suggest the fierce radia- tion of heat in much the same way that the repeated outlines of plant forms in the Song of the Katydids are designed to evoke the pulsating heat waves and the rising cadence of the insect chorus.7 This pattern in the picture provides a kind of nimbus that at once enframes and completes the composition. It should be noted that in this as in the other watercolors of this romantic period there is no real interest on the part of the artist in either form or surface texture. The emphasis is entirely on the pattern and the precise optical psychological effect of a certain type of light. It is almost as though the solid form had been whisked away like a chair AUG.UST SU N LIGHT 157</page><page sequence="4">BURCHFIELD'S SEASONS from under a slipcover, leaving only the flat transparent slide of light itself.8 The second picture in the Museum col- lection by Burchfield is entitled March Sunlight. This picture was painted in 1926 and 1934. The artist describes it as A 'canyon" in the Cattarangus Creek (the point in the center marks the con- fluence of the East and West Branches) about a mile east of Gowanda, N.Y. The effect sought here is of the late afternoon sunlight in early Spring, when young trees seem to bristle with up-shooting growth. I made this sketch in 1926, never felt satisfied with it, and seven years later, went back to the same spot, on the same kind of a day, and re-worked it, using what I had as a sort of "under- painting." To me the little islands in the center were like a dream world, or fairy- land come to life. This painting is on a very large scale and, like so many of the artist's watercolors, has a feeling of solidity and opacity that one usually associates with oil. Mr. Burch- field himself has said that the only differ- ence he can see between oil and watercolor is that in one the colors are mixed in oil and in the other medium they are com- bined with glue or glycerine; oil colors are thinned with turpentine, watercolors with water.9 He prefers to use watercolor because he finds it less laborious than oil. Someone once observed that no exhibition of oil paintings is complete without a watercolor by Burchfield. This is, of course, a rather supercilious, but nonethe- less just, criticism of Burchfield's water- color technique. He employs the medium the way most artists use oil. He builds up his composition with small strokes and opaque pigment without any regard for the transparency of the medium. He has no feeling for the fine and freely flowing MARCH SUNLIGHT 158</page><page sequence="5">BURCHFIELD'S SEASONS wash with the transparency and spontane- ity that we associate with the purest em- ployment of the technique. For Burchfield watercolor is simply a pigment which he applies to the paper in order to color his drawing, as other artists apply oil to canvas. One is so accustomed to Mr. Burch- field's urban views that one is apt to for- get his capability in the painting of pure landscape. The present example has a sense of tremendous breadth and spacious- ness. The vast panorama is held together by the parentheses of the confluent streams repeated in the massive bastions of the canyon walls that provide balancing and stabilizing accents at the two edges of the composition. As in all of the watercolors of Burchfield's mature period one is very conscious of the brush strokes. They not only suggest a palpable pigment texture, as in oil painting, but fulfill a calligraphic function in describing the structure of rocks and water and foliage that is almost suggestive of that organized vocabulary of brushwork for the definition of specific things in nature which we associate with the technique of the Chinese landscape painters. It is interesting to recall in con- nection with Mr. Burchfield's reference to the little islands in the center of the river as a dream world that a student with whom I was examining the picture commented on what he chose to describe as the surrealist character of the feathery little trees on the central island. The en- chanting ghostlike quality of these lumi- nous little spears of white with their feathery russet halos of leaves are, of course, vaguely suggestive of the eerie and substanceless forms used by the practi- tioners of surrealism. I have introduced this observation only to show how com- pletely Mr. Burchfield has been able to convey the dreamlike quality that struck him in this part of the scene. The deli- cacy and lightness with which these little flame trees are painted is in all likelihood a deliberate contrast with the solidity and even heavy painting of the surrounding landscape in order to achieve through this pardonable artistic overstatement the effect of "fairyland come to life." The technique that Mr. Burchfield describes of using an earlier sketch as the under- painting for a completed picture is only one method that the artist has of rework- ing what he originally regarded as a not entirely satisfactory composition. In some instances he has greatly enlarged the size of a watercolor by mounting it on a board and pasting new sections of paper around it to the desired size. Many of his paint- ings, too, are finished on the basis of sketches done many years before. An illustration of this last method is the September Sunlight of 1932 which is the third example of his work in the collec- tion of the Fogg Museum. Regarding this watercolor Mr. Burch- field writes: This was painted in my studio at Garden- ville, N.Y. from a pencil study made in 1923 at New Albany, Ohio (near Salem). I think I was influenced in the lighting of this picture by the almost total eclipse of the sun of that year (91% at Buffalo). The half light was very strange, and when I painted this a few days later I was still under the spell of its weirdness. There was an interesting phenomenon in con- nection with the small windows under the eaves on the main part. The frames vere warped, so that each small frame was on a plane slightly at variance from the others. As you walked along, accordingly, the light reflected in the different frames was of a different intensity and changed as you walked, so that they seemed like eyes blinking. Rather impossible to put into a picture, yet that seemed to add mystery to the house. Two old bachelors lived in it, at the time. House and bach- elors are all gone now. One might almost wish that the artist had incorporated some allusion to the eclipse in his title, since the recording of the eerie sulphurous light is so perfect once one knows that this was the effect of illumina- 159</page><page sequence="6">BURCHFIELD'S SEASONS tion the painter intended. Before know- ing the circumstances under which the picture was done, the writer had always supposed that the dramatically darkened sky was simply an arbitrary device in- tended to silhouette effectively the shape of the old house and to step up the lumi- nosity of the tawny grass in the fore- ground. This painting is a notable ex- ample of Mr. Burchfield's ability to render at once the form and texture and mood of such pathetic and yet lovingly recorded human hovels. His dry brush technique is particularly well adapted for recording not only the precise articulation of every strip of clapboard and dislocated window frame, but also for its suggestion of the very feel of these weathered old timbers and the effects of light reflecting on their surfaces. A peculiarly sinister effect is achieved by painting the house almost completely in shadow with only a few salient light accents to relieve the deep cavern of gloom. The effect of both the texture and movement in the waves of withered grass in the foreground is an illustration of Mr. Burchfield's mastery in what one can only describe as his calli- graphic use of the brush. One feature of this painting that seems like a definite retention of some of Mr. Burchfield's earlier expressionistic devices is the hauntingly anthropomorphic char- acter of the house at the right which, once discerned, is so persistent that it becomes almost impossible to see anything else but the beetling brows of the sagging roof, the glaring eyes of the windows under the eaves which he describes in his letter, a nose provided by the overhang, and a dreadful attenuated mouth in the door- way. However distracting we may find SEPTENIBER SUNLIGHT i6o</page><page sequence="7">BURCHFIELD'S SEASONS this "double image," its insistent presence is an extraordinary indication of how nearly Mr. Burchfield has achieved the almost impossible effect which he de- scribes. It clearly shows, too, how all through his later work "there has been the romantic trend more obvious perhaps in the early years, but never lost sight of." 10 All three pictures in the Fogg col- lection are perfect illustrations of what Mr. Burchfield means when he says, "While I feel strongly the personality of a given scene, its 'genius loci', as it were, my chief aim in painting it is the expres- sion of a completely personal mood." "' The four pictures in the Fogg Museum are representative of Burchfield's interest in recording the seasons and their moods. The March Sunlight presents us with a kind of epitome of spring with the pale gold sunlight of lingering winter, a mo- ment of quiet between the winds whose bluster and roar underline the coming of spring. The blinding sunlight and the shriveled foliage of the August Sunlight suggest a summer already spent with its prophecy of the year's dying. The cold crystal light of autumn fills the September Sunlight. In these three watercolors the connotation of the season is achieved through the artist's pictorial suggestion of the kind of light that we associate with these times of year. In the final painting of the series, Factory Town Trees, which is wholly dedicated to winter, the cold and gloom of the season are suggested by the murky tonality and by the almost pal- pably heavy and oppressive cloud shapes that overhang the composition. It could be said of these watercolors in the Fogg collection that like all of Burchfield's watercolors they reveal an artist's pictorial statement of separate and different ideas rather than a continual harping on only one idea. One feels that his treatment of his subject is completely typical, that there is no striving for the unique or the unusual. It is for this very reason that his paintings present as complete and characteristic a portrait of a part of America as one could find, a country that Burchfield both loves and finds poetry in.

"A painting that seems to bridge the gap between August Sunlight and the later ex- amples of his work in the collection has been lent to the Museum by Mr. Charles Bain Hoyt. This watercolor is entitled Factory Town Trees and appears to have been done in the early '2o's before Burchfield had en- tirely abandoned the expressionistic symbol- ism of his earlier works and before the de- velopment of his later concern with form and texture. A cold winter rain is falling and large drops in Chinese white are painted over the composition as though running down a pane of glass that separates us from the scene. Three pathetically bare and scraggly trees are seen in the foreground. The windows, like angry eyes, glare at us from the mean houses. In the background a heavy plume of smoke issues from a volcano-like chimney and min- gles with the black pall of cloud that hangs over the town. The picture is painted in heavy strokes of opaque gouache on a buff pastel paper which itself serves as the local tone for many parts of the composition. In this picture Mr. Burchfield comes as close as he ever does to satirizing the ugliness of the Middle Border. 9"Burchfield Explains," Art Digest, April 1, 19x,5, p. 56. 10 Charles Burchfield, op. cit.
