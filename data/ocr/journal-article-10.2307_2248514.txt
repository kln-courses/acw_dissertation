<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. Vol. xv,, No. 4. J. H. Tufts. ' Some Con- tributions of Psychology to the Conception of Justice.' [Applies the psychological doctrines of the complexity of the individual, the nature of the individual as both habit and adjusting activity, the emptiness of forms without contents, and the social character of the individual, to the problems of the just distribution of wealth, the just distribution of education and other mental goods, and the administration of justice by the courts. The injustice of present conditions is shown, and remedies are indicated.] A. E. Taylor. ' The Place of Psychology in the Classi- fication of the Sciences.' [Psychology is a natural science. It is dis- tingfuished from the abstract philosophical sciences by their use of transcendental noumenal ideals into which no time-variable appears to enter; and from the concrete, the Geisteswissenschaften, by their evaluation of temporal facts in terms of intellectual, moral and aesthetic worth and in the light of transcendental ideal standards.] G. N. Dolson. ' The Idealism of Malebranche.' [This is in some respects unique, and, while it resembles that of Berkeley, is yet more akin to later systems. Epistemnologically, Malebranche's view of philosophical method consists in making and keeping clear of confusion the various elements of con- sciousness due respectively to reason and sensation. Ontologically, the system centres about the doctrine of ideas. Joly's contention that it is essentially realistic is not admissible.] J. E. Russell. 'Some difficulties with the Epistemology of Pragmatism and Radical Empiricism.' [State- ment of four difficulties-. the pragmatic union of the ruling conceptions and methods of psychology and logic; the meaning of thought; the ex- planation of truth and knowledge; thl logical escape from solipsism.] Reviews of Books.

[Review of theories of interest, as connected with feeling and attention, from Herbart to Calkins.] B. Sidis. 'Are there Hypnotic Hallucinations ?' [The introspective account of the hypnotic subject must be taken cum grano. Hypnotic and posthypnotic hal- lucinations are not genuine, but are essentially spurious; hypnotic hallucinations, unlike actual hallucinations, are really not experienced; hypnotically suggested hallucinations are merely forms of delusions.] J.

'A Study of Certain Relations of Accommnodation and Convergence to the Judgment of the Third Dimension.'

[Report of experiments with plane and solid figures. The cause of inversion lies in the relation between the observed object and the central and periph- eral parts of the retina in which the image of the object is produced. Any proceeding will occasion inversion which facilitates the passage of the rays from an object once on the central part to another on the peripheral part of the retina (change of accommodation, change of fixa- tion, reflex changes in ophthalmometrical experiments, etc.).] AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY. Vol. xvii., No. 3. I M. Bentley. 'The Psychology of Organic Movements.' [Organic movements offer a variety of problems to psychology, demanding detailed treatment. Theories, however, fall into two groups, emphasising either'the motor conditions or the motor consequences of consciousness. The tendency of the former is toward a central psychophysical formulation; but so little is here known that, while almost any theory will command attention, none brings proof or receives widespread assent. The tendency of the latter is (especially in America) toward reactionism: their weakness consists in their appeal to an ill-defined and faculty-like attention.] J. P. Porter. ' The Habits, Instincts, and Mental Powers of Spiders: Genera Argiope and Epeira.' [Review of literature; methods of study; choice of place for web, nest and materials of nest; mode of web con- struction; quantitative measure of variability of instinct (number of elements in parts of webs); time of web-spinning, and stimulus to web- construction; feeding habits and intelligence: web-shaking instinct; vision; mating instinct in Argiope; tropisms vs. plasticity in instinct; bibliography.] S. P. Hayes. 'A Study of the Affective Qualities. I. The Tridimensional Theory of Feeling.' [An attempt to test the Wundtian theory by extending the method of paired comparisons to affective judgments of all three dimensions. Experiments with har- monical clangs and metronome beats. The pleasantness-unpleasantness responses were direct; there was no evidence of a plurality of these qualities. Strain may be identified with unpleasantness, on its affective side. Less direct were the judgments of excitement, depression and re- laxation: these were either associatively motived or given on the basis of pleasantness or unpleasantness.] A. L. Gesell. ' Accuracy in Hand- writing, as related to School Intelligence and Sex.' [Accuracy of hand- writing in pupils of elementary grade tends to vary directly with school intelligence. Sex differences in writing become marked at about the age of ten, and are largely attributable to mental factors.] E. Foster and E. A. McC. Gamble. 'The Effect of Music on Thoracic Breathing.' [In listening to music, breathing becomes rapid and shallow, as in mental application, but remains irregular. That is, attention rises, but does not become proportionately stable.] Psychological Literature. Book Notes. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS, III., 5. G. A. Tawney. 'The Nature of Consistency.' [Discusses logical, metaphysical and psychological aspects of the term together, confus- edly]. K. Gordon. 'Feeling as the Object of Thought.' [Feeling is the 'other' thought points to, and no further 'absolute'is needed. 'For why should the real other of thought be any better or more real than thought itself ?'] W. P. Montague. ' The Meaning of Identity, Simi- larity and Nonentity.' [A criticism of the ' logical puzzles' in Russell's article 'On Denoting' in MIND, N. S., 56. The first two arise from ignor- ing differences in the universes of discourse; the third assumes also that affirmative juidgments may be made about nonentities.] III., 6. J. D. Stoops.

III., 7. J. R. Angell. 'Re- cent Discussion of Feeling.' [Reviews the papers by Marshall, Gardiner, Gordon and Washburn in the Journal, and finds that they agree " that feeling should designate the distinctly personal internal aspects of con- scious life," but hints that it may be necessary to " abandon all pretence of employing the term in a technical nmanner ".] J. A. Leighton. ' Cognitive Thought and Immediate Experience.' [Polemic against Dewey and James; but "of course thought must make a difference to reality . . . and some reality must be of the sort to which thought can make a difference ".] W. H. Sheldon. ' The Quarrel about Transcen- dency.' [" Any matter of belief can be formulated in either experiential or realistic language," and so there is no real issue here between radical empiricism and realism, as judged by the pragmatic test.] III., 8. E. G. Spaulding. ' The Ground of the Validity of Knowledge,' i. [ Needs and the Transcendent.' Pragmatism is evolutionistic and realistic. Needs, and 'success' in satisfying them examined. "The ground for validity in the sense of ' successful working' is external-to the inference itself as a logical and psychological event." Concludes that therefore " the need can be met only by a transcendent which is itself order and regularity, causal agent, persistent, permanent."] M. S. Case. ' Prof. Calkins' Mediation.' [Between functional and structural psychology.] Review of Santayana's Life of Reason, by A. W. Moore. III., 9. E. A. Norris. 'Thought Revealed as a Feeling Process in Introspection.' [Attempts to show (1) that all intellectual operations may be regarded as feeling process only, being (2) wholly manipulations of emotional states and specialised feelings, and (3) that in all thought not directly influenced by sense emotional states are primary factors.] W. G. Chambers. 'Memory Types of Colorado Pupils.' [Auditory memory is distinctly inferior in every grade, from eight to twenty-one, etc.] F. C. S. Schiller. 'Thought and Immediacy.' [Apropos of the discussion between Dewey and Bakewell, II., 19, 22, 25, 26. Not only is there an immediate side to all mediation, but it is mistaken to represent thought as immanent in perceptual experience. What has been mediated is not now mediate. Psychologically the tense is essential. Logically also the function of thought is to enrich imrnediate perception, vovsv is al'tOi07(rms and Xo6yos is instrumental.] lI., 10. T. Dewey. 'IReality as Experi- ence.' [Considers the problem of the existence of reality prior to con- scious organisnms. The earlier reality is ever 'on its way to experience'. ' It is only the earlier portion of what later is experience,' and this ' con- 'tinual-transformnation-in-the-direction-of ' can only be properly appre- ciated in the experience of the scientist, philosopher, etc.] E. G. Spaulding. 'The Ground of the Validity of Knowledge,' ii. Imtplica- tion and the Meaning of ' In Experience'. The demand for a transcen- dent is a 'biological' implication: so too, taken as an assumption, it is 'biological'. Because this implication is asymmetrical, the transcendent can be both ' in' and 'beyond' experience; as ' implied' it is ' known '.] Report of the sections of anthropology and psychology of the New York Academy of Sciences.

[To show that the evidential function of particulars is to disprove alternative hypotheses and thus by elimnination to establish the survivor.] F. C. Becker. 'The final edition of Spencer's First Prin- ciples' [Spencer has not moderated his agnosticism, and still fails to distinguish between "thinking and imaging ".] Finale of discussion</page><page sequence="4">580 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. between Prof. Miner and Dr. Baird. III., 12. E. G. Spaulding. 'The Ground of the Validity of Knowledge,' iiin [Argues that klnowledge always transcends itself, both in its ' alogical' forms, (1) memory, because what is remembered is ' beyond' the memory-act and unalterable by it, (2) imagination, similarly, and (3) perception, which is taken to be of a real object; and (4) in its 'logical' form, where the implications transcend the assertion. It is, however, admitted that the 'independence' of the object may not be ' absolute,' though not apparently perceived, either that the 'transcendence' is a mere claim, or that it after all falls within the experience-process.] Report of meeting of the Western Philosoph- ical Association and abstracts of papers. III., 13. William James. ' G. Papini and the Pragmatist Movement in Italy.' [Calls attention to "an extraordinarily well-informed and gifted, and above all an extra- ordinarily free and spirited and unpedantic group of writers," whose programme of an ' Uor no-Dio,' whether to be called, " Promethean or bull- froggian " is " one of the possible great type-programmes of philosophy," and contrasts their style with that of the " bald-headed and bald-hearted young aspirants for the Ph.D." of American seminars, who "have all these years been accustomiied to bore one another with the pedantry and technicality, formless, uncircumcised, unabashed and unrebuked, of their ' papers' and ' reports '."] V. A. C. Henmon. ' The Detection of Colour-Blindness.' [A reduction in colour sense is commoner than is usually supposed, and there are all degrees of ability to discriminate colours, of which colour-blindness is only the lower extreme.] W. B. Pitkin. 'Why Solipsism is rejected.' [Cf. IIl., 4. Distinguishes be- tween the dogmatic absolutistic solipsism which denies the existence of others, and the negative sort which merely denies the proof of this.] J. R. Angell. 'A Reply to Mr. Marshall.' Section of Anthropology and Psycnology of the New York Academy of Sciences. III., 14. K. Gordon. 'iMetaphysics as a Branch of Art.' [" The truths of art and of metaphysics are felt truths, but are not facts which have at any time been demonstrated."] E. G. Spaulding. ' The Ground of the Validity of Knowledge,' iv. [" It is upon the peculiar and distinctive characteris- tics of the transcendent that knowledge and knowing depend." Their " structure is complex and involved " and the transcenfdent is the source both of the need and the means of satisfaction.] Report on the Yale Meeting of Experimental Psychologists. II., 15. B. H. Bode. 'Real- ism and Pragmatism.' [Criticises the realism of Hobhouse and G. E. Moore, and concludes that " the endeavour of pragmatism to derive both sense and thought from a more fundamental category is no more suc- cessful than the attempts already noted to reduce all 'acquaintance- with' to the category of 'knowledge-about,'" which duality seems so far ultimate.] A. E. Davies. 'The Personal and the Individual.' [Both are "differentiations within a given group".] G. Santayana. 'The Efficacy of Thought.' [A comnment on A. W. Moore's review. Distinguishes eight senses in which thought may be said to be 'effica- cious,' of which he rejects three, and explains that his book was merely " a biography of human reason," and not " a complete cosniogony ".] III., 16. W. E. Hocking. 'The Group Concept in the Service of Philosophy.' [" The primordial data of mathematics must always be pragmatically defined, in the sense that they express particular results of the character of the concept, and not the character itself." The Group Concept rests on three postulates.] F. L. Wells. ' Linguistic Standards.' [Results of making graduate students supply 'missing words' in a context.] T. P. Bailey.

'Reality</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 581 as Possible Experience.' [Argues that Royce's 'constructive idealism' is utinecessary, because Kant's idea of reality as possible experience is adequate if 'possible experience' is taken to mean not immediate ex- perience but the knowledge gained from it.] G. A. Tawney. ' Two Types of Consistency.' [Habit and Readjustment, the one easy, familiar, certain, the other difficult, tentative, experimental. But the one for ever passes into the other.] L. P.

Vol. xvi., No. 4, July, 1906. J. Oliphant. ' Moral Instruction.' [Should be informal and unsystematic, and suggestive rather than authoritative or dogmatic. Should be directed to enlarging the child's views of the influence of his acts, and quickening his sensitiveness to the feelings of those whom they affect.] C. F. Dole. 'About Conscience.' [" Conscience is not a negative sense; it is positive and constructive. . . . It is the tie, or the force, which binds men socially, and like a spiritual gravitation, draws them to the thought of a universal Life."] S. Coit. 'Humanity and God.'

G. Compayre. 'La Pedagogie de l'Adolescence.' [Analyses and occasioinally criticises, from the peda- gogical point of view, Mr. Stanley Hall's recent book on Psychology of Adolescence. Like J. J. Rousseau, with whose views his pedagogy has often much affinity, Mr. S. Hall draws too hard a line between the ages of infancy and of adolescence. Viewed generally, the book lacks order and logic: the author has gathered and accumulated materials rather than built an edifice. But he is to be praised for having laid, with labour worthy of admiration, the foundations of the future building.] A. Binet. 'Les premiers mots de la these idealiste.' [A careful examination of the two arguments afforded by Strong in his book, Why the Mind Has a Body, in defence of the idealistic thesis. The first, based on the existence of physio- logical mediation between object and perception, is not at all demonstrative of the non-physical character of perception: this argument, on the con- trary, may be retorted against the idealist. As to his second argument, the metaphysical one, founded on absolute opposition of nature and lack of communication between mind and matter, it is fundamentally con- stituted by a set of arbitrary metaphors, realistic at bottom.] Th. Ribot. 'Comment les passions finissent.' [There are five essential forms, to which all other are reducible, of the extinction of a passion: i.e. ex- haustion or habit, transformation into another, substitution, madness, death. These forms are successively described, analysed and illustrated by the author, who sums up his general conclusion thus: " The prob- ability of extinction of a passion is in a direct ratio to the quantity of emotional elements, and in an inverse ratio to the quantity of intellectual elements which it holds in a systematised state."] Revue critique.

Juillet, 1906. L. Levy-Bruhl. 'La Morale et la Science des Moeurs.' [A very interest- ing reply to some objections directed by MM. Fouillee, Cantecor, Belot and others against his theory as propounded in his book, La Morale et la Science des Mweurs. The theoretical objections to his conception of ethics as a science of morals, as well as the prediction of its dangerous consequences either for the moral consciousness or from the point of view of political and social action, arise alike, according to M. Levy- Bruhl, out of a reluctance to accept thoroughly the idea of a "moral nature" and the necessity of a scientific knowledge of that nature.] J. Sageret. 'La Commodite scientifique et ses Consequences. [M. Poincare has completed the positivist conception of science by adding to it that the object of a science is also to express the relations and the systems of relations in a convenient language. M. Sageret seeks what consequences flow for the idea of science from this notion of conveniency. The most important of these is that the mathematical sciences (so-called) are to be wholly separated from the homogeneous group constituted by the other sciences. Mathematics should be classed among the arts, that is to say, among those arts which are both means of expression and of action. Thus science proper will never assume the character of artificial system nor scientific truth appear to be variable, when the scientist sub-</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 583 stitutes more convenient means of expression and action for less con- venient means. Thus also shall we get an altogether general idea of science, on the principles of positivism.] G-L. Duprat. ' Contre l'in- tellectualisme en psychologie.'

[A defence of monism as defined by the following formula: " Nothing happens in man without the modification of something that can be measured ". It is impossible for a monist who accepts this formula to conceive consciousness otherwise than as a mere epi-phenomenon. This latter theory, whose vindication seems to be, the veritable aim of the author, will be studied in a second article.} Roerich. 'L'Attention spontanee dans la vie ordinaire et ses applica- tions pratiques.' [Spontaneous attention is either primitive or apper-- ceptive. These forms in their relation to ordinary life are both studied by the writer, who states and illustrates, in a very interesting way, their- scientific laws and the practical rules to be derived from them.] A.. Chide. 'La LogiqLie avant les logiciens.' [Rationalistic logic or the philosophy of concepts has crushed down, by the genius of Socrates and the Platonists, the other logics or dialectics that could possibly have organised the ideation and life of our (so-called) Aryan race. But was this logic necessary ? The only method to find an answer is to seek whether the general original structure of our Indo-European languages. is in conformity with the rationalistic logic or not. A survey of the diverse linguistic theories of Bopp, Brugmann, Regnaud, etc., leads M. Chide to an identical conclusion, viz., that the primitive thought was not at all directed towards rationalism. The primordial conception is aware of all relations, all modalities: subsumnption is unknown to it. It is to a subsequent deviation from nature and a kind of aberration that the emergence of the characteristics of rationalised mind is to be ascribed.] Edme Tassy. 'Le Syinpathique et l'ideation.'

[It has been shown that, when we apprehend certain complexes of objects of sensation (points or lines), the resulting inadequacy of the idea of form (optical illusion) is conditioned upon the formation of this form-idea itself, and not simply upon the spatial arrangement or the simultaneous observation of the objects of sensation.
