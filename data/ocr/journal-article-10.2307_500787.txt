<plain_text><page sequence="1">Das Ludovisische Relief, by Ernst Langlotz. Pp. 27, p1s. 2, figs. 36. Florian Kupferberg Verlag, Mainz, 1951. The greater part of this pamphlet is devoted to the interpretation of the principal relief of the Ludovisi "throne." The subject cannot be, the author argues, the birth of Aphrodite from the sea. The two figures that, on this hypothesis, would be Horai stand to the left and right of the goddess on pebbly ground, i.e. on land. If she is in the sea, they must be thought of as standing in front of her and helping her out of the water up a steeply sloping beach. But in that case they could not reach across her back and grasp her under the armpits as they are shown doing. Furthermore we should have here a case of early archaic perspective, with the figures of the two Horai turned ninety degrees from what their real position would have been. No in- stances of such perspective can be cited for the period of the Ludovisi "throne." We have, more- over, no parallel for Aphrodite's being lifted from the sea, nor would it, as a matter of fact, be pos- sible to lift her by grasping her in such a manner. Finally, no satisfactory explanation of the piece of drapery held by the Horai has ever been offered by proponents of this hypothesis. This piece of drapery and the manner in which the two side figures take hold of the central one are also inconsistent with such subjects as the Anodos of Kore or the rising of some other goddess from the earth. A further difficulty is that we should expect the ground from which the goddess is rising to be as pebbly as that on which the other two figures stand, whereas it is represented on the relief by a simple fillet. Another theory is that the scene represents a woman or goddess in childbirth or else a birth god- dess in the kneeling posture of childbirth, like the Av'yn 4 y6p'ar at Tegea (Pausanias 8.48.7). As some of the arguments for it are unfamiliar to those who have not studied the problem of this relief, I shall summarize them before giving Langlotz's criticism. The theory was first proposed by Wolters and Carl Robert (Archaiologike Ephemeris 1892, cols. 227- 229; col. 227, note 3), who reached this conclusion independently of each other, was accepted by Wil- helm Klein (Geschichte der grieschischen Kunst I 394 ff.) and John Marshall (Burlington Magazine XVII [1910] 249-250), and was revived in 1941 by Carpenter (MAAR XVIII [1941] 41-61. Wolters took the central figure to be a goddess or heroine, but forbore to identify her further; Robert appar- ently held a similar opinion. Klein called her Leto. Marshall seems to have thought her an ordinary woman. Carpenter argued that no birth is taking place, but that the central figure is a birth goddess like the Eileithyia called "Auge on her knees" by the Tegeates. All agree that the side figures are supporting her, but the explanation of the cloth they hold in front of her differs. Wolters thought it represents the cloth in which the midwife would receive the child and which we see held by Athena in representations of the birth of Erichthonios. It appears also in the Utrecht Psalter (P. Wolters, Festschrift Heinrich W61fflin zum siebzigsten Ge- burtstage 1935, p. 175) in the illustration to Psalm 48.6: "Fear took hold upon them there and pain, as of a woman in travail"; beside a group of a kneeling woman supported by two standing women stands a fourth woman holding the cloth. The artist of the Ludovisi relief has unrealistically, argued Wolters, given this indispensable article to the two supporting figures in order not to encumber his com- position with a fourth figure. Carpenter thinks the cloth is used to hide the fact that the figure is kneeling. To kneel on both knees was indecorous</page><page sequence="2">1954] BOOK REVIEWS 69 because of its association with childbirth, he argues (forgetting, apparently, such figures as the women kneeling at tombs, etc.). He attempts to re-enforce this argument by referring to a statue of Eileithyia which, Pausanias tells us, only her priestess was allowed to see and to others that were veiled from head to toe. Langlotz rejects the theory that an actual child- birth is represented on the grounds that (1) no provision is made for the child and (2) this subject does not occur in Greek art; the group in the Cesnola Collection C.S. 711 "bleibt infra artem." The miniature in the Utrecht Psalter, though similar in composition to the Ludovisi relief, shows a woman in labor collapsing from pain; it is meant to repre- sent not childbirth but the fear and pain described by the psalmist. In the Ludovisi relief nothing whatever suggests that the central figure is collapsing from pain. An artist of this period would have seized the opportunity for an idealized representa- tion of such a state of feeling. The hypothesis that the central figure is a birth goddess is also rejected by Langlotz. The figure cannot be kneeling, for the distance between its navel and the lower edge of the relief is not great enough. Nor, indeed, is kneeling characteristic of birth goddesses; Eileithyia never kneels in representations of the birth of Athena, and the only bronze statuette that is identified as Eileithyia by its inscription, British Museum 188, shows her standing. It was only the statue of Auge in labor, who was worshipped in Tegea as Eileithyia, that was in a kneeling posture. As for the statues that were veiled from head to toe, we may imagine them as looking like the Etruscan goddess in the star-decked mantle on the ossuario Primoli in Flor- ence (Milani, Mus. di Firenze, pl. 84). A number of telluric gods and daimones, on the other hand, were represented kneeling, and Eileithyia could be re- garded as distantly related to them. The best known are Damia and Auxesia, who are goddesses of fer- tility but are nowhere said to be primarily birth god- desses. Langlotz gives a list of these kneeling figures in art of the seventh century and earlier; that such gods were Pelasgic in origin is, he thinks, shown by the Minoan gem from Mycenae with a goddess, who seems to be kneeling, between two lions (JHS 21 [1901] 164, fig. 44; see, however, Nilsson, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion2 [Lund 1950] 281, n. 61). Langlotz's own interpretation is that the scene represents a ritualistic bath. This would account for the loosened hair of the central figure, for the way in which her chiton clings to her (though for this, he remarks, another explanation is possible), and for the action of all three figures. The central one is just emerging from below the surface and strains upward, while the two attendants are on the point of bending over to give her another dipping. The puzzling piece of cloth might be the lower part of her chiton, which they have picked up to prevent its spreading out over the surface of the water and thus destroying the solemnity of the rite. Or per- haps it is a separate piece of cloth used for the ritualistic veiling of the bather's body. Whether the central figure is a goddess or a mortal Langlotz does not attempt to decide, though he suggests that the latter is more likely. The relief is perhaps connected with a cult of Hera, since we have considerable evidence for bathing in her cults. Langlotz ap- parently takes Hera to be a form of the "telluric universal divinity" (tellurische Allgottheit), to whom "the service of the hierodule is as pleasing as the role of the matron in the family." The hierodule and the matron are represented by the naked flute- player and the woman in chiton and himation on the two side-reliefs. These women are not meant symbolically, but are ministrants who accompany the cult act depicted on the main relief with fluting and an offering of incense. Langlotz accepts the idea that the "throne" came from an altar; it served as a windscreen, the fourth side of the altar being left open. The form is famil- iar both from vase-paintings and from extant ex- amples, though in monumental forms of the latter the upper surface of the side-pieces is horizontal. Such an altar, as Reichel observed, resembles a throne; that the ancients also felt this is shown by the reference to the great altar at Pergamon as the "throne of Satan" in the Apocalypse. The religious ideas underlying this form probably have their roots in western Asia. See, however, the recent article on stepped altars by Herbert Hoffmann published in this Journal (57 [1953] 189 ff.; in note 39, p. 193, lines 2 and 3 should read: "Polycharmos of Nau- kratis apud Athenaeus 675 f-676 c gives the," since Athenaeus's source was not an oral account but a book by Polycharmos). The art of the sculptor of the Ludovisi "throne," Langlotz observes, is East Greek, but our knowledge is too fragmentary to allow us to discover his origin and the place of his activity. Fragments from the Athenian Acropolis (Schrader, nos. 78, 79, 80, 81, 116) perhaps come from his workshop or from a workshop derived from it. With these figures are to be placed the Artemis of the Aktaion metope, statu- ettes from a group or small pediment in Selinous (MonAnt 32, p1. 25), the "Leukothea" stele in the Villa Albani, the stele from the Esquiline in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, the stele no. 837 in Copen- hagen, the head of the peplos figure in the Villa</page><page sequence="3">70 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 58 Borghese BrBr 262, and the terracotta head from Veii (Dragma Nilsson, 3, fig. 1), which was probably made by an artist of Magna Graecia. The Ludovisi master may have been influenced by or have been a pupil of the master of the Exaltation de la Fleur. In regard to this period particularly, we must not apply to the schools of the great masters, which were Panhellenic, the limited conception that is indicated for local guilds working for export. An artist like the Ludovisi master would hardly have obtained great commissions at home. He had to seek them in the rest of the Greek world - to travel and enrich his art with all that was significant and suited to him in his time. I have found few misprints. In the last line of p. 10 for Akraia read Limenia. In line 2 of note 52 on p. 27 "Tillaeg zu" should be omitted. In this same line for 174 read 974. It might perhaps, have been well to indicate that figure 7 is a back view. This figure should be turned right side up. The pamphlet is rich in suggestions and compari- sons. All archaeologists and students of religion will be interested, for example, in Langlotz's list of kneeling figures. To call them telluric, however, is, it seems to me, to beg the question. One such figure, the A~5yn ev y6 acrt, we are told by Pausanias, was an Eileithyia, and we are also told that the worshippers of this figure associated its kneeling position with the act of giving birth. The fact that the statuette of Eleuthia in the British Museum does not kneel does not prove the Tegeates mistaken; a goddess can be represented in different ways. Least of all could we expect the Eileithyiai in scenes of the birth of Athena to kneel, for here they are acting as mid- wives. As for Damia and Auxesia, whose function evidently was to provide abundant crops, their kneel- ing position may be due to the analogy between agriculture and procreation, which was obvious to the Greeks and frequently alluded to (e.g., in the Athenian marriage ceremony). What the other kneeling figures listed by Langlotz represented we simply do not know; to call a figure accompanied by lions a "Herrin des Todes," for example, is assuming too much. The theory that the subject of the relief is a ritual bath would be hard to disprove. We should like, of course, to know whether Langlotz found evidence that women ever wore chitons while taking such baths. Even if they did not, however, it would, perhaps, not be surprising that a sculptor of this period should add the chiton for decency's sake. Compare the fourth-century grave stelae of women who died in childbirth, some of which show the deceased with a chiton, while on others she is without one; the latter doubtless represent the prac- tice of real life (see Oppian, Cyn. I 497). Similarly, we are not meant to assume that the girl on one of the side-reliefs was naked when she played the flutes on ritual occasions. The sculptor has represented her naked in order that we may be quite certain of what she is - a hetaira. Merely showing her fluting would not necessarily indicate this; cf. the fluting maenads on vases. Evidently hetairai took a public part in the cult for which the Ludovisi relief was made, and this fact was unusual and important. Surely this rules out Hera, who was a goddess of marriage. Nilsson long ago saw that this figure of the naked flute-player points to the cult of Aphrodite in Corinth, in which both hetairai and respectable women took part; the woman with the cloak drawn over her head represents the latter, being neither a bride nor even necessarily a matron, but a lady in street costume (RM 21 [1906] 307 ff.). If, then, the scene represents a bath, we should assume that this rite was performed at Corinth or possibly in some other place where a similar custom prevailed. Need we, however, assume that it is a bath? Has Langlotz, perhaps, been over-exact in interpreting the place of the pebbles in the relief? For on the pyxis by the Penthesileia Painter in Ancona with the birth of Aphrodite (AA [1941] 451 if., figs. 51-54; Beazley, Attic Red-Figure Vase-Painters, 1942 [here- after ARV] 588, 113), where the goddess is identified by the inscription, pebbles are likewise shown on either side - or rather in front and back, since we see her in profile -of the rising figure. In front of her is Eros holding a fillet for her, in back is Charis running up with a cloak. Both Eros and Charis are obviously on dry land, as well as everyone else in the picture except Aphrodite herself. Is she per- haps coming ashore in an inlet? We cannot, in any case, blame the carelessness of the Penthesileia Painter for the illogicality, if illogicality there is, and argue that the artist of the Ludovisi relief would have proceeded differently. For this scheme, the rising goddess in the center and figures on either side, is canonical in fifth-century representations of the birth of Aphrodite, as we see from the pelike by the Erichthonios Painter (Beazley, ARV 720, 2), the subject of which is identified by the inscription, and from three vases on which the subject is identified by the presence of Eros: a hydria in Syracuse that is near Polygnotos (ARV 701, 99) a hydria in Genoa in the manner of the painter of Bologna 417 (ARV 603, 42), and a pyxis in New York by the Wedding Painter (AR V 606, 21). Pebbles do not occur in any of these representations, but there can be no doubt that the goddess is rising from the sea; as Rumpf acutely observes (JDAI 65-66 [1950-51] 166- 167), this is proved by the piece of cloth held out by</page><page sequence="4">1954] BOOK REVIEWS 71 an attending figure on the hydria in Genoa, with which he compares that handed to a bathing woman on a fourth-century hydria in the Robinson collec- tion (CVA, U.S.A. 7, III I, pl. 15, 1), and that brought by Charis on the pyxis in Ancona. As for the piece of cloth held by the two "Horai" on the Ludovisi relief, Studniczka was, I think, right in interpreting it as the bottom of Aphrodite's chiton. It looks different from the rest of the chiton because, instead of clinging damply to her body, it is ex- tended by the pull of the two hands that hold it; compare the way the part of the skirt around and behind the raised heel of the linen-clad "Hora" on our right contrasts with the straight folds of the rest of the skirt, and these, in turn, with the crinkled folds of the blouse. Studniczka, however, did not understand why the skirt is lifted, and neither does Langlotz. That L. D. Caskey did is shown by his comparison with the rising goddess between two Pans on the skyphos by the Penthesileia Painter in Boston (ARV 588, 103) who lifts her skirt herself (AJA 22 [1918] 111, note 2). We can now cite in addition the pyxis in Ancona, where Aphrodite steps on shore with her skirt up to her knee. The explana- tion is that a woman wearing a long, full skirt who does not lift it while taking a step upward risks stepping on it. In a modern dress, the result might be no worse than a rip at the waistband or a tear in the skirt itself. A home-spun, hand-woven linen chiton would become a 7rXoVros et/aro KaK6s in such circumstances and cause its wearer a fall. The two attendants are making it as easy as possible for the goddess to take the long step up onto the beach by relieving her of the bother of looking after her skirt as she does so. At the same time, they support her firmly under the armpits and across the back. As she steps upward, they will straighten up, thus helping her to rise. The sculptor had doubtless observed women helping each other up steep places in this way. Langlotz's remark that the Horai and Eros do not have to help Aphrodite, since she rises from the waves "kraft g6ttlicher Macht," but merely to receive and adorn her is one-sided. On the hydria in Syracuse Eros is not merely greeting Aphrodite; he is helping her. The pyxis in New York shows a later point in the same movement. With such anthropomorphic gods as those of the Greeks, stress on divine or human qualities naturally varies from artist to artist and from work to work. The rising goddess with Pans on the skyphos by the Penthesileia Painter in Boston has sometimes been tentatively identified as Aphrodite, but part of the evidence in favor of this identification has, so far as I know, been overlooked: it is the small, forked ivy branch that seems to float in the air above her (I am not referring, of course, to the ivy wreath around the rim of the skyphos). Ovid, Fasti IV 141 ff., tells us that when Aphrodite was drying her hair on the shore some satyrs saw her. She protected herself from them with a screen of myrtle. Ovid uses the story as an aetiological myth explaining why Roman women wore myrtle wreaths while bathing on the feast of Venus, April Ist (cf. Plutarch, Numa 19), and it is possible that he has substituted myrtle for ivy. It looks as if the original tale were inspired by the ivy miracle that took place at the birth of Dionysos (Euripides, Phoin. 651 ff. and schol.). There was, however, a Naucratite myth of a myrtle miracle performed by Aphrodite that resembles the grapevine miracle of Dionysos in the Homeric Hymn on Dionysos and the Pirates (Polycharmos of Nau- kratis in Athenaeus XV 676 a). This suggests that Ovid's ultimate source may also have had myrtle and that it was the Penthesileia Painter who changed it to ivy, being, as Dietrich von Bothmer has re- minded me, fond of that plant. Rumpf (JDAI 65- 66 [1950-51] 171) has pointed to a possible connec- tion between the branch held by Zeus at the birth of Aphrodite on the pyxis in Ancona and the branches held by "Pandora" on the calyx krater by the Niobid Painter in London (ARV 420, 21); the "Pandora" has been claimed by Brommer as an Aphrodite, an identification that would be almost certain if we could be sure that the dancers cos- tumed as Pans in the lower frieze were intended as part of this scene. Could these branches also be an allusion to our story? That in the original tale the intruders were Pans, and not merely satyrs of goat form, is suggested by the regularity with which Pans appear in this scene on vases and by the presence of Pan among other gods at the birth of Aphrodite on the Syracuse hydria. Rumpf has made the very attractive sug- gestion that the connection between Pan and Aphrodite grew out of the fact that they were neighbors on the Athenian Acropolis (op. cit., 168). Now Pan, after he had taken up his abode on the Acropolis in 490 B.c., also began haunting, among other places, the island of Psyttaleia, where he brought destruction on the flower of the Persian forces at the battle of Salamis (Aeschylus, Pers. 447 ff.; Pausanias I. 36.2; Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Der Glaube der Hellenen II 177). Pindar calls him a patron of fishermen (frag. 98 Schroder). It cannot be argued, therefore, that the presence of Pans shows that Aphrodite is rising from the earth rather than from the sea. Pans, it is true, surround the rising Persephone on the calyx krater in Dresden (ARV 699, 67), but might not the transference of this motive to her have been facilitated by the presence</page><page sequence="5">72 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 58 of satyrs in such scenes as that on the neck of the volute krater in Ferrara by the painter of Bologna 279 (ARV 428, 1) and that on the bell krater in Stockholm (Die Antike 6 [1930] 7, fig. 6)?
