<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH ANALOGUES TO THE LIBER SCALM i THE among contents Arabists of - MS. as well Bodlej as among Laud Misc. scholars j)j of have Dante's aroused works, interest since among Arabists - as well as among scholars of Dante's works, since it seems to many almost certain that they provided Dante with the germ of the plan of the Divina Commedia. The manuscript is probably of English provenance; the text it contains reveals a number of parallels to the details of certain English poetical works: it therefore deserves attention in English studies. It is the unique copy of the French version of the Uber Scala, a translation of a lost Spanish version of an Arabic text, describing the Prophet Muhammad's visions of the isrã* and the mi'rāj, that is, the 'horizontal' journey to Jerusalem, and the 'vertical' journey to the world of the afterlife.1 Not only is the Spanish version, by the Jewish translator Abraham of Toledo, not extant, but the anonymous Arabic original itself is lost. The Kitãb al-mi'räj, as it is known (i.e. the 'Book of the Ladder') makes the Prophet speak throughout in the first person, but the nature of the descriptions of the Temple of Jerusalem, of the circles of Heaven and Hell, and of the Day of Judgment (this last given by the Archangel Gabriel) places the book in the ranks of popular eschatology and cosmology, rather than among the deeper works of Moslem theology and mysticism. The French translation was carried out by Bonaventura da Siena in Seville in 1264, and, like so many of the translations of Arabic works, had been ordered by Alfonso the Wise. Bonaventura also himself trans- lated the work into Latin, and of the version in this language two manuscripts are known: Paris Bibliothèque nationale 6.064, a late four- teenth-century manuscript from Britanny, and the defective Vatican 4072, which contains other Latin texts relevant to Islam. Bonaventura's two versions have been edited together as parallel texts, in two entirely separate editions which both appeared in the same year, and which both contain, in addition to the parallel texts, editorial comment of consider- able length and detail: Enrico Cernili II ' Libro della Scala*, e la questione delle fonte arabo-spagnole della Divina Commedia Vatican 1949, and José Muñoz Sendino La Escala de Mahoma Madrid 1949. Cernili discusses the work further in his article 'Dante e l'Islam' Al-Andalus (xxi) 1956. Part II of CeruUi's work deals, as the tide indicates, with the question of the influence of the text upon Dante, and serves to confirm the main 1 ^Pf a study accounts of the isra 9 and the mPraj see M.

Cerulli examines the parallels between the Scala and the Commedia - general parallels of narrative structure, and of cos- mology, and specific parallels of incident, detail and phraseology. The earlier sections of CeruUi's Part II show the extent of the diffusion of a knowledge of the Kitab al-micrãj in Spain and Italy, especially in anti- Islamic polemic, from the close of the twelfth century, that is, before the translations had been undertaken (when the work was already known to Spanish Catholic polemicists in the original Arabic) - and as late as Caracciolo's Specchio della Fede (1495). Fr. Muñoz likewise discusses the diffusion in Spain and Italy of accounts of the mi'raj. Mr. Norman Daniel, in his Islam and the West: The Making of an Image (Edinburgh i960), frequendy mentions the Liber Scala , and considers it to have been 'of enormous influence' (p. 148 ; and cf. the references in the index of this work). ii The Oxford and Paris manuscripts had already, before the two editions appeared, been noted by Ugo Monneret de Villard, who commented upon their interest ('Lo studio dell'Islam in Europa nel xii and e nel xiii secolo' Studi et Testi 110 Vatican 1944 p. 53). Cerulli argues for an English provenance for MS. Bodley Laud Misc. 337: this has been some- what obscured by Fr. Muñoz, who posits, in overspecific terms, a continental provenance. This he does by identifying its hand with that of the fourteenth-century MS. BM Add. 38118, a French version of the Apocalypse, and therefore itself an eschatological work. The provenance of this work is Northern France, and it is supposed to be specifically Breton, as the Paris manuscript of the Scala is. There seems in fact to be no connection between Laud Misc. /77 and BM Add. 38118. Add. 38118 has an irregular alternation of initials which are red on blue, and initials which are blue on red: it contains many miniatures. Laud Misc. 33 7 seems to me to be in a different hand, some- what less rounded; its initials are all red, and the miniatures it contains are both on f. iv, one in the bottom right-hand corner, in the margin, the other an illuminated initial, with a marginal extension. Fr. Muñoz dates Laud Misc. 337 as thirteenth or early fourteenth century. Cerulli's edition gives the opinion of Dr. Otto Paecht that the manuscript is probably English, and of the early fourteenth century. The jottings it contains are attributed to the fifteenth century. Among these jottings are presumably to be included the erased lines on the front end-paper (f. ir), the pen-tries on f. 5r, and possibly also the coat of arms sketched</page><page sequence="3">English Analogues to the Liber S calce 23 in roughly on the back end-papers,2 though the scribblings and comic drawing on f. 5 2V are no doubt later. (The manuscript also contains a Greek inscription by Samuel Clarke - presumably the Oxford orientalist, 1625-1669 - and an inscription by Laud with the date 1637.) Mr. Neil Ker would also give a fourteenth-century date, and a probable English provenance, to the manuscript: the initials are all in red, a habit aban- doned upon the Continent by that date; the binding, of red leather upon wood, is the original one, and shows the English characteristic of having its thongs attached to the front cover, and not the back. It therefore seems very likely that the unique copy of the French version of the Scala was produced in England in the fourteenth century, and has always remained there. It is legitimate, then, to assume that its contents may, if only indirectly, have been known to English imaginative writers. It is worth noting the details in it which are analogous to those found in a number of English poems that contain eschatological and cosmo- logical descriptions, even if no direct or exclusive influence can be proved. Even if in specific cases other works can be adduced as the actual immediate sources, the Liber Scalce must, nevertheless, now be added to the list of instructional and encyclopaedic works, which pro- vided the poets of the later middle ages, and of early modern times, with the current tokens with which their imagination was able to play.3 There is the additional interest that the same ideas, and the same imaginative touches, recur, on the one hand, in Islamic civilization, in a work which describes an experience of the Prophet, and, on the other, in western Christendom, in poems of a sometimes more subjective nature; these are themselves also sometimes deeply pietistic, but in other cases they are works of a very different nature. The mutual influence of Islam and Christianity is, in fact, already to be seen in the Liber Scalce itself. But 2 The coat of arms drawn, or rather scratched, upon the end-papers consists of two chevronels (the colour is not indicated) upon a field of ermine (or, conceivably, to include the possible colour variations, erminites, erminous, or pean). A list of families bearing arms of this description can be compiled (see J. W. Papworth and A. W. Morant Alphabetical Dictionary of Coats of Arms (1874) and Burke's General Armory 1884). Omitting those which have a crest as well as a coat, and those in which the chevrons are sable (for in their case, the probability is that the scribbler would have shaded in the chevrons), the list is reduced to : Femynor, and Silley (or Siile), both ermine with two chevrons gules. Ermine with two chevrons sable is the coat of the Fenner and Illeigh families. An Edward Fenner (afterwards Sir Edward) was Puisne Judge of Queen's Bench, 1590 (J. Haydn, rev. H. Ockerby, Book of Dignities 1890); he is presumably the same Edward Fenner who was serjeant-at-law in 1577. Sybilla, daughter of Edmund and Alice Illeigh, married Sir Edmund Jenney, knight, of Knodishall (J. Burke Commoners iii 446). A similar coat (ermine, two chevrons azure) with crest and supporters, forms the arms of Lord Bagot (temp. Richard II: see A. C. Fox-Davies Armorial Families 1910), and ermine, two chevrons gules, with a crest, those of the Somer family: a Henry Somer was Puisne Baron of the Exchequer, 1407 (Haydn Book of Dignities ). 2 In early modern times, an account of the micraļ , apparently m Arabic, existed m one British ms. collection. It is no. 1880,205 ln Bernard's Catalogue (II ii 64) and was in the Library of Narcissus Marsh, Archbishop of Dublin, in 1697. ^r- Muñoz, misreading Bernard, records it under the im- pression that it is a Latin ms. (He, connisingly, refers to Marsh by his Christian name and bishopric, without his surname.)</page><page sequence="4">24 Medium Evum xxxrv. i there it is working in the opposite direction. It is not an integral part of Moslem teaching to describe the four legs of the Throne of God as held up (c. xl) by beings which correspond to the four creatures of Ezekiel. The angels before the Throne, in the same passage, are singing the Sanctus. There is, of course, no reason to suppose that the Christian influence is western and not oriental, while parallels between the Scala and texts produced by western Christian writers may be due to rabbinical influence acting upon both in common. in There are in the Scala a good number of descriptions of walls, build- ings, and whole cities built of precious and semi-precious stones, and bearing a likeness to the architectural description in the Hous of Fame, excepting where this is specifically Gothic in style. C. xxx describes the walls of Paradise in these words: . . . ego respiciens vidi quod magni quadrati lapides hujus muri ita distincti erant inter se quod ipsorum alii erant de auro, alii de argento, alii de rubino, qui inter áureos et argénteos erant siti. Hujus quidem muri tanta erat claritas et tam magna quod vix poterai respicere homo ipsam. Vidi edam quod calx, qua ipsi erant conjuncti lapides, tota de musco et ambra erat cum aqua nempe rosacea dissoluta, que ita bene redolebat quod nullus est qui dicere illud posset.4 This is the traditional imagery of the apocalyptic city. We shall glance later at very early uses of this imagery, and return to Chaucer's poem, but what is most immediately striking is surely that this description ushers us into the same dream-world as Pearl. The similarity of subject is close: both the English and the Arabic text describe the architecture of a heavenly city, mention a bejewelled river, and describe a concourse of virgin maids in Heaven. C. xxxiv of the Scala has this description of the cities and buildings of Paradise: Alii vero Paradisi omnes daritatis existunt. Sunt eciam in eis dvitates et castra quam multa, que omnia daritatis sunt. Et edam palada, domus, atria, camere, cunctaque alia loca infra hujusmodi dvitates et castra sunt similiter daritatis . . . Et nichilominus sunt ibi tot tentoria que sunt super ripas illorum fluminum et tam diversarum manerierum et tot enim edam domus que sunt ita pulcre, ita nobiles forme mirabilis quod nullum cor hominis cogitare hoc posset. Et omnes sunt purissime daritatis. Another similar description, in c. xli, is concerned specifically with the casdes of the newly-sanctified: Ac ipsi respidentes donum superadditum, viderunt multa castra, quorum muri et turres omnes et edam domus, sale camere, ac alia cuneta loca intus existencia erant de auro et argento, de rubinis, de smaragdis et aliis lapidibus predosis manerierum omnium; et similiter de perlis que cunctorum colorum erant quos possit aliquis hominum cogitare. Sale quidem ¿Ile strate erant pannis aureis et 4 1 take quotations from Cerulli's text,, and sometimes indicate variants in Muñoz.</page><page sequence="5">English Analogues to the Liber Scala 25 serieis tali modo quod ille qui viridis erat plus quam omnis smaragdus erat viridis atque claras, et qui rabeus erat rabicundior et clarior quam rabinus. A similar description of buildings made of precious stones is in c. xlv. A few pages earlier than this, in c. xliii, the river of Paradise is described. There we have an exact parallel to the bejewelled river-bed of Pearly in which pe graueyl J?at on grounde can grynde Wem precious perle5 of oryente, in the detail arena ipsius fluminis nichil aliud est quam lapides preciosi. One of the descriptions of the maidens of Paradise occurs, a few lines after the description of the stream, in c. xliv: In tentoriis illis morantur virgines que arabico eloquio nominantur 'hal- kories', quod interpretatur: electe et a Deo eciam custodite, quia ipse ita bene custodiuntur quod nullus eis apropinquare audet nec eciam ipse diabolus, nisi solum illi quibus sunt ipse concesse. De pulcritudine autem illaram quid vobis ? Nullus homo earn dicere posset aut corde proprio cogitare. Hec namque domicelle sedent super diciores pannos tocius mundi. Et quando illi, quibus ipse concesse sunt, veniunt illue, assurgunt eis et ipsos valde honorifice reci- pientes iteram sedent eciam cum eisdem. It is piquant that these maidens which remind us so strongly of the Brides of the Lamb, should in fact be the houris of the Moslem Paradise; the western reader with his exotic image of these (see Daniel, op. cit., especially c. v, section 4) will have been reassured by the extract above that their behaviour is very far from being wanton: a point already emphasized in a passage which comes earlier in the Scala (c. xxxv), at the end of a passage containing a description of their dress, adornments and singing. This, too, may be considered in conjunction with the corresponding passages in Pearl (11. 1093-1128, as well as 11. 161-180, 205-228): . . . vidi quod in tentoriis et domibus existentibus super ripas fluvioram predictorum erant domine pulcriores et mundiores ... Et omnes sunt purissime claritatis. Ibi namque sunt domine pulcriores et mundiores quam possit ullum cogitare cor hominis . . . Hec namque domine omnes habent capita sua circum- voluta perlis atque preciosis lapidibus, et desuper nichilominus capitegia claritatis. Sunt quidem ipsarum vestimenta claritatis omnia.

Verumptamen nesciunt qui esse debeant, nec nomina eorumdem . . .</page><page sequence="6">26 Medium íEvum xxxiv. i If we are to admit the possibility that the Liber Scala might be con- sidered to have supplemented the Book of Revelation as a source of the imagery of Pearl, two points are worth considering. One is that the cončourse of virgins in Revelation 14 are not female but male, as pointed out by Gordon (in his note to Pearl , 1. 869). The concourses described in the Scala are therefore closer in nature to those in Pearl. The second, also pointed out by Gordon (note to 1. 1007) is that the Pearl poet removes the sardonyx of Révélation 21. 10, and substitutes the ruby. As will be seen from the passages quoted above from cc. xxx and xli of the Scala, the ruby figures prominently in its descriptions of buildings. This can be seen again in the description of the Seventh Heaven, in c. xxxvi. Here the buildings made of precious stones are mentioned together with the concourse of singing virgins. The passage is therefore a particularly suggestive parallel to the concluding section of Pearl : Et primo dicam vobis de Genet hanaym, qui est in Paradisis proprie domus dei . . . Muri quoque paradisi hujus omnes sunt de rubinis; et turres et domus similiter que sunt intus; sed lecti namque et lectorum stramenta et scale per quas ascenditur ad solans et similiter vasa omnia, necnon et porte predictarum domorum edam sunt de perlis. Sunt namque ibi intus domicelle amorosissime, que censies milies pulcriores et jocundiores sunt aliis, de quibus feci vobis superbis mendonem. Et similiter sunt ibi tentoria, quorum quedam sunt de rubinis, quedam de smaragdis, quedam de perlis et ita de omnibus maneriebus predosorum lapidum, magis pulcra magisque edam mirabiliter operata quam cogitare possit cor hominis alicujus . . . Sunt edam ibi cantus dulces et mirabiles domicellarum, que sedent sub arboribus que sunt ibi, omnes de lapidibus predosis. IV The Liber Scala is by no means the only Arabic work of Moslem eschatology which contains parallels to Pearl. Asín Palacios quotes, or refers to, at least thirteen relevant texts in sections vi and vii of Part II of his work. The authors they are attributed to range in date from Ibn Wahb and 'Abdullah ibn al-Mubārak in the eighth century, to Shãkir ibn Muslim in the earlier twelfth century. It should be noted that all the examples attributed to the eighth century are known through a compila- tion made by Ibn Makhlūf al-Tha'labī (1386-1468), and given the date 1445 (Brockelmann, Geschichte der Arabischen Litteratur, supplementary vol. ii; p. 351): the book is Kitãb al-ulūm al-fãkhirah fil naahar fi 'umür al-ãkhirah , that is, The Book of Splendid Sciences , enquiring into Matters of the After-World (printed Cairo 13 17 A.H./1 899-1900 A.D.). It is, in fact, in this work that the majority of the texts cited by Asin Palacios in this connection are contained. (Here I sometimes quote the English transla- tion of Sunderland, made from Asin's translation of the Arabic.) Asín refers (Sunderland, p. 117 and note) to an Islamic tradition of 'scenes ... in the form of visions of souls in purgatory, who appear to</page><page sequence="7">English Analogues to the Liber Scala i-j their relations in their sleep and beseech them to pray for their eternal rest'. But we are more concerned with the visions which have a contrary intention: those in which a living man, usually in a dream, sees a female dweller in Paradise, against the setting of her celestial home, reproaching or comforting him, and lending him spiritual guidance. The woman is, in these cases, a heavenly bride who is awaiting the man. In one text ('Abdullah ibn al-Mubãrak, eighth century: in ībn MakhlūJ , i. 112) the celestial bride draws the contrasts between herself and the dreamer's earthly wife. In another (Ibn Wahb: eighth century: Ibn MakhlūJ ii. 129) she reproaches him for his attachment to his earthly wife, in another (Al-Qurtubl, in his Tadhkirah'. Ibn MakhlūJ i. 121) for earthly attach- ments in general. In a fourth - the relevance of which to the rôle of Beatrice is manifest - the bride proclaims that she has rejoiced whenever he has shown religious devotion, and has been saddened whenever he has neglected his spiritual well-being - (text partly in Samarqandi, Qurrat al-Ujūn, tenth century; more fully in al-Suyūtī; Al-durar al-hisãn , a fifteenth-century compilation. In others, the houri is the figure for whom an ascetic has abandoned the things of this world ('Utbah al-Ghulām, prior to the eleventh century), has herself been made more radiantly beautiful by the ascetic's devotion (Ahmad ibn Abul-Hawarl, ninth century) - or promises herself as a reward for the undefiled living of a man who now beholds her for the first time ('All al-Talkhi, prior to the tenth century: these last three tales are in Al-Ghazālī, yIhjã' ' ulūrn al-din , an eleventh-century work; Cairo ed., 1312 A.H., iv. 364). That the vision of the heavenly maiden is, in this tradition, connected with spiritual guidance or comfort, is thus clear. Further, she is often shown in surroundings which resemble those of the maiden in Pearl. The legend told by 'Abdullah ibn al-Mubārak makes the protagonist say 'I seemed to be led to a mansion built of rubies, constructed out of a ruby- stone wherein I saw a woman whose . . . beauty enraptured me.' An anecdote concerning a devout young man, told by 'Abdul- Rahmān ibn Zayd, also of the eighth century (Ibn MakhlūJ, i. 1 1 3), places the maiden upon a river-side, within a building of pearl, and with other beautiful and richly-dressed maidens as her companions: One day he came to us and cried out, 'Oh, how I long to be with the beautiful large-eyed maiden ... In a dream, it seemed to me as though I was in a garden watered by a river; on the bank of the river stood a group of fair maidens in jewels and garments of inestimable worth . . . They welcomed me and said, "This is the bridegroom of the beautiful large-eyed maiden whom we serve. Go on your way." I came to a second river, flowing with clear honey; on its banks there shone a radiance . . . There were other maidens there. "Peace be upon you", I said to them, "is the beautiful fair-eyed maiden among you?" "No, o beloved of God, we are her handmaidens: go on your way." I pro- ceeded, and saw before me a pavilion made out of a hollowed pearl. At its</page><page sequence="8">28 Medium Aìvum xxxiv. i entrance was a maiden decked in jewels and garments such as I cannot de- scribe . . . When she saw me she smiled and called out [to the maiden within] "O beautiful large-eyed maiden, your spouse is here". I entered: she was seated upon a throne of gold encrusted with pearls and rubies. "You are welcome, o beloved of God" she said, "the time of your coming has drawn near". I went up to her, but she said, "Do not hasten, for the spirit of life still breathes in you, but to-night you shall break your fast in my company".' A river-bed of precious stones, and a procession of young persons (of both sexes), are further details found in a very full description of the arrival of the soul in heaven, written partly in rhymed verse, by the twelfth-century Shākir ibn Muslim, of Orihuela (Ihn Makhlūļ ' ii. 6i ff.), who claims to be quoting Muhammad ibn Sulaymãn. The passage proceeds, as given by Asín, to describe the garden, river, angels, the celestial spouse and the heavenly concourse in terms which illustrate this eschatological tradition at its richest, and at its closest to the descriptions in Pearl. Although this is true of the original, Asín Palacios, no doubt out of the reticence which characterizes his generation and the cultural traditions of his country, omits a considerable amount of erotic description. The passage in full - and I shall not quote the whole of it here myself - can be read as a sex-fantasy using the theme of the celestial bride. It is, in fact, a passage which, unlike the majority of the descriptions of the hour is, does, for once, bear out the popular western notion of the sensuality of the Moslem paradise. Shākir ibn Muslim describes the way to Paradise: upon the plain before its gate, an aromatic breeze blows, reviving the spirit of the newly-dead. At the gate are two trees, with birds in their branches: 'At the foot of either tree is a spring of water, sweet and fresh. These springs are the sources of two green streams, clear as a flask; their beds are of powdered camphor, strewn with a gravel consisting of pearls and rubies, and pebbles of silver and gold. Their water is clearer than crystal, cooler than snow which has been melted in perfume, whiter than milk in which sweet scents have been blended . . . Along their banks spread gardens and groves of trees in blossom, laden with fruit and harbouring birds of sweet song . . .' The newly-dead bathe in the two rivers, drink of one of the springs, and perform their ablutions at the other, forget their past sufferings, and lose all envy and hatred. They then rest in die shade of the two trees, eating of their fruit, and making themselves clothing out of their foliage. Then the angels of the Lord call out to them, 'O beloved of God, these trees are not your dwelling; your appointed place is close to God. Rise, therefore, and march onward.' They do so, and go forward: . . . following the voice of the herald from garden to garden, until they meet with their servants, youths and large-eyed maidens, who have with them choice horses . . . They greet them with cries of joy and congratulations upon their</page><page sequence="9">English Analogues to the Liber Scala 29 triumph . . . Each bestrides his horse and they ride forward to their castles, the young man and women going before them, with shouts of joy, of triumph, and of praisegiving to God . . . Each visits castle after castle allotted to him: the buildings have walls of red gold, and balconies of red ruby, decorated with emeralds and other stones. Around the casdes are gardens, in which are large-eyed maidens and fair youths. The believer finds ... a youth at the entrance to a domed mansion, surpassing all other youths in beauty. He welcomes him and in the mansion he finds 'a damsel of surpassing beauty'. The youth cries out, 'O beloved of God, this is your noble wife, your dear spouse' . . . When she sees him, she cannot restrain the impulse of her love, but hastens towards him with fond words of welcome, 'O beloved of God! How long have I yearned to see you ... I am one of your lithe and young-breasted wives, delightful to dally with.' The man now has intercourse with her, and discovers that his sexual prowess has now increased a hundred-fold. From her he goes on to another bower and another woman, and from there to a third. It is only fair to point out the erotic nature of this description, and not to gloss over the polygamous details, not the covert touches of an ancillary homosexuality. But one can set these apart, as Asín Palacios has done, and, shorn of them, the passage remains the fullest in the tradition under study. (The cumulative nature of the visits to gardens, castles, and women suggests that behind the extract there lies a less baroque description, which has been overlaid in rehandling.) v Even the erotic aspect of this last vision has a parallel in European literature - in a tradition where the erotic fantasy is crudely comic and not, as in Shakir ibn Muslim, crudely lyrical. With this analogue, I return to the text of the Scala itself, different though this is in its attitude. After describing the miraculous dinner- table of the blessed in the seventh heaven, the Scala (c. xxxvii) refers again to the fifth heaven ( jannat al-khuld ), and mentions its trees, which produce, apparendy as their fruit, flesh and birds, cooked and ready to be eaten: Nam et si forte ipsi [the blessed] voluntatem habeant ad Paradisum qui nominatur 'Genet halkolde', de quo loqui superbis audivistis, videant [French: por veoir] arbores que ibi sunt et gustent [French: et por goster] de fructibus earumdem, incontinenti veniet ad eos quidam angelus, qui ducet ipsos illuc et dicet priori arbori quam invenerint : 'Date michi pro servis Dei de comestionibus</page><page sequence="10">jo Medium jEvum xxxiv. i vestris.' Et mox arbor illa dabit ei LXX milia scutellarum cibariorum prepara- torum de tot carnium maneriebus et avium, quod nullum cor hominis cogitare hoc posset. Et sciatis quod hujusmodi nonhabent plumas ñeque pennas ahquas vel os ilium nec sunt in aqua decocte nec ad ignem assate; et ita saporose ad comedendum sunt velut butirum et mei edam simul mixte; redolent quoque ad modum musa et ambre. Ready-cooked chickens and other foods are one of the characteristics of the Land of Cockayne. They may, according to Littré (s.v. Cocagne), be considered the leading characteristic, or, at least, the earliest element, that gave the fantasy its very name, which he derives from coquere. Certainly, the lines from the Scala remind us of the best-known imagina- tive expression of the myth of Cockayne, Breughel's mid-sixteenth- century print, with its roast chicken which has dropped on to a plate, set out upon a lawn which is fenced in with sausages, while, in the background, another chicken is flying into the mouth of a farmer's wife. The rhyme written under the print of Luilekkerland5 runs: Die dar luij en lacker bör crijsman oft clercken die gherackt daer en smaeckt dar wan als sonder werken. Die tuijen sijn worsten die juijsen met vlaijen cappuimen en kieckens t vsiechter al ghebraijen. that is All ye who are lazy and gluttonous, be ye peasant, soldier or scholar, get to the land of Cockaigne and taste there all sorts of things without any labour. The fences are sausages, the houses covered with cakes; capons and chickens fly around ready-roasted. The English poem of The Land of Cockayneř has flying geese and larks ready to eat (11. 102-104, 108-111), the spiced larks flying up to men's mouths eagerly. The passages in the Cockayne poem which deal with the sexual promiscuity of the monks, scabrous as these are, resemble Shākir's fantasy, though with a distinct difference of tone. The poem, however, contains further imagery strongly reminiscent of Shākir's description of other passages given by Ibn Makhlūf, and of the Liber Scala itself: its descriptions (11. 67 If.) of the 'abbey' made of precious stones, its pillars of crystal, with base and capital of green jasper and red coral. Four springs (milis, 1. 8j) run with different perfumes, scattering gold and precious gems upon the soil. This association of the flying roast fowl with bejewelled buildings and streams is all the more striking as a parallel to the Scala, for the totally different use of it here. It would not be inapposite if it were ever established that the Northern European day-dream of Cockayne owed something to the day-dreams of Heaven in the popular imagination of 5 See A. J. Barnouw The Fantasy of Pieter Brvegbel New York (1947). • R. H. Robbins Historical Poems of the Xlvtb and XVtb Centuries New York 1959, pp. 121 «.</page><page sequence="11">English Analogues to the Liber Scala ji Islamic lands. On the other hand, it may be that both derive ultimately, and separately, from an earlier tradition, apparendy a Judaeo-Hellenistic one. This tradition is known principally through a text which parodies such fantasies, namely, Lucian's True Story. This, I believe, is the earliest known text which combines ready-cooked foodstuffs with buildings made of precious stones, and surrounded by rivers, as the elements of a paradisiacal life. The passage in question is part of the description of the Isle of the Blest, and was understood by the scholiast to Lucian's text to be a parody on the New Jerusalem7 - a supposition which A. M. Harmon takes to be not necessarily true.8 Harmon's translation runs as follows: . . . The city itself is all of gold and the walls around it of emerald. It has seven gates, all of single planks of cinnamon. The foundations of the city and the ground within its wall are ivory. There are temples of all the gods, built of beryl, and in them great monolithic altars of amethyst, on which they make their great burnt-offerings. Around the city runs a river of the finest myrrh, a hundred royal cubits wide and five deep, so that one can swim in it comfort- ably . . . Instead of wheat-ears, loaves of bread all baked grow on the tops of the halms, so that they look like mushrooms. In the neighbourhood of the city there are three hundred and sixty-five springs of water, as many of honey, five hundred of myrrh - much smaller, however - seven rivers of milk and eight of wine. VI I have already drawn a parallel between the architectural descriptions in the Scala and in the Hous of Fame. I now turn again to Chaucer's poem, only too conscious, of course, that to add yet another conjectural 'source' for some of its details to a growing list, is certainly to multiply entities in an already overcrowded area. But it may not be doing so unneces- sarily, if one is contributing even a detail towards a clearer picture of that common convention which was Chaucer's garner of symbols and images. The account of the mPrãj has already been noted by Sypherd {Studies in Chaucer's Hous of Fame) (1907 p. 91, n. 5) who cites the only version known to him, the Persian Miraj-Nameh. The common element which attracted Sypherd's attention was the ascent to heaven, in an eschatological description, by means of a helpful animal. In the account of the isrã' the Prophet is carried through the air on the back of a mysterious horselike creature called the burãq. In the Scala, this animal is described in commonplace terms, as masculus anachibus uel auseribus quoque paruis', or, in the French version, molard des annes. Those who are 7 H.

In other passages eagle-faced angels are mentioned, indeed, the aquiline angel is the norm in the Scala, rather than the anthropomorphic : Nam cum introissemus acce invenimus ibi septuaginta milia angelorum qui omnes habebant ad modum aquilarum fades, (c. xv) These are angels of the Fourth Heaven; in the Fifth Heaven, too, the Prophet meets with Angelos qui corpora quam plurimum habentes nobilia, fades tarnen habebant ad modum vulturum et ipsorum quoque ale purissima claritate splendebant. (c. xvi) As in the instance mentioned already, of the Archangel Gabriel describing the judgment of the dead, the principal angels explain and comment upon things to the Prophet. As these are not specifically described in the text as* eagle-faced, the assumption must be that they are not, so that their direct resemblance to Chaucer's informant is not close. Yet one of the only two illustrations in Laud Misc. j}j shows a stern-looking angel, with eagle's wings, and anthropomorphic, but extremely aquiline, features: the detail is one that struck the fancy of the fourteenth-century illuminator. Another great bird which is mentioned more than once in the Scala is the angel in the form of a cockerel, who is the Angel of Prayer. In c. ix, the Prophet sees this angel: vidi quemdam angelům ita magnum quod ipse tenebat caput suum super celum et pedes edam in abysso . . . Erat enim angelus iste factum ad modum galli. Et ostenderat sibi Deus omnes horas quibus fieri oradones dedebant. When this archetypal cockerel crows, the cockerels of the earth call out in praise of God. In c. xxix, the Cockerel of Prayer is seen before the throne of God: Gabriel et Raphael ostenderunt michi quemdam galium, qui proprie [Munoz: prope; French prope] Dei erat. Hic namque gallus tenebat caput suum et crestam ad celum, ubi Deus est et cathedra ejus ; et pedes suos ad magis infimum terre septime de qua in sequentibus audietis. In c. lix it is explained that the Celestial Cockerel stands upon Mount Qaf. There is material here out of which the Eagle of the Hous of Fame might have taken shape. True, however, in spite of the parallel, the primary cause which instigated Chaucer to provide this bird as his</page><page sequence="13">English Analogues to the Uber Scala 33 guide and means of transport could have been something different from all this : was possibly the mystic eagle of Dante's Paradiso xviii-xx, or, conceivably, was a fanciful quibble upon Boethius' reference to flight upon the feathers of philosophy ( Consolatio , iv, metre i), a passage which he parodies verbally in his own 1. 972.* In the Scala the creatures intermediary between man and angel are not equated with the traditional Arab jinn , but are the neo-Platonic aerial beings, that is, the 'ayrish bestes' of the Hous of Fame, here depicted as anthropomorphic: . . . quarens ab eo postmodum si ultra montem ilium qui nominatur Kaf homines essent necne. Ipse quidem michi respondit quod in aere erant creature quedam vive, in hominum modum facte. Tunc ergo quesivi cujusmodi homines isti essent. At idem respondens dixit quod hoc nemo sciebat nisi solus Deus qui formaverat eosdem. (c. lxix) To complete the list of parallels, it is worth noting that, among the angels, there is one human, one ' man of Auctoritee', encountered in c. xv; that, perhaps surprisingly, is Aaron, seated upon a throne, in lucent array: Et dum angelos respicerem antedictos, nichilominus inter eos adhuc respiciens vidi quemquam hominem mirabiliter pulcre forme; qui sedens super quamquam claritatis sedem ac vestibus eciam lucidissime claritatis indutus, habebat de claritate in capite suo diadema tam splendidum quod vix respicere poterat homo ipsum. 9 The Angel of Prayer resembles Chaucer's Fame in that its body stretches up from earth to Heaven. We may disregard this detail for it has two analogues in Chaucer's familiar reading: Boethius I, prose i, and Aeneid iv 173-82. Having a multiplicity of eyes is another feature of the supernatural beings in the Virgilian passage : Chaucer gives this attribute to his goddess Fame (Hous 0/ Fame 1 1 38 if.) perhaps influenced as much by the creatures of the Throne in Revelations 4. 6, 'full of eyes before and behind', as by Virgil. The descriptions in the Scala, of angels each with many faces and many pairs of eyes, place it in the same common apocalyptic tradition, though on a more popular level, which sometimes, in attempting the awesome, runs very close to the absurd: Omnes angeli qui erant qui [in the First Heaven] salutaverunt me . . . respiciens vidi quod ipsi habebant facies hominum et corpora ad modum vaccarum; habebant eciam ad modum aquilarum alas . . . quilibet habebat septuaginta milia capitum et quodlibet caput septuaginta milia cornuum . . . in quolibet predictorum capitum erant septuaginta milia facierum et quelibet facies habebat septua- ginta milia orum et quidlibet [Muñoz: quodlibet] os septuaginta milia linguarum. (c. xii) or, again, in the Eighth Heaven: Et mox venit ad nos quidam angelus de claritate totus, cujus claritas septuagesies milies major erat quam claritas solis extat (Muñoz: extet). Habetat eciam angelus ille septuaginta milia facierum, et quelibet facies septuaginta milia oculorum, et quilibet oculus LXX. milia pupillarum, et quelibet pupilla tremebat LXX. milibus horarum [French: LXX mil foiz] in die, territa Dei metu. The smallness of the earth, when seen from above, or of the whole cosmic system, seen from outside, is noted by Scipio in the Somnium and, in the Hous of Fame , by the poet himself. Though this is a point that would independently strike any cosmonaut, there are two analogues in the Scala, differing slightly from each other. The cosmos is seen like a 'prick' by the Angel of Death, as he flies upon his missions: totus mundus est ante me valde parvus, he says (cap. vii). But in chapter xxi, it emerges that the cosmos is contained within one leg of the Throne of God: Et intra cathedram illam celum et terra et eciam mundus totus. Et hoc ita parvum quid videtur esse in cathedra, sicut iam granum sinapis in palma alicujus magni hominis videretur.

I quote somewhat exten- sively, so as not to omit those details where a parallel is not found, and thus avoid overstressing the closeness of the two descriptions: In hiis vero tentoriis oriuntur per se ipsas, juxta Dei beneplacitum, mulieres que arabico dicuntur eloquio 'Halkoralen* [i.e. al-hūr al-'ayn] quod interpretatur: domine admirabiles, quia sine dubio sic sunt ipse. Nam ita magne sunt quod unum ex super- ciliis cujusque ipsarum ita magnum erat prout est arcus ille qui in nubibus celi patet . . . oriuntur domine supradicte ad modum herbe, quando primo ex terra exit. Et post- quam ipse nate et formate sunt cooperiunt se capiUis propriis, qui pulcriores et clariores sunt quam possit exprimere os mortale. Postea vero crescunt in tantum quod ipse cum capitibus tentorium summitates attingunt. Et eis sic attingentibus, mox tentoria incipiunt aliquantulum se movere; et cum hoc faciunt, confestim sciunt angeli, qui ea custodiunt, quod domine nate sint et quod ipse jam creverint, prout debent. Et tunc venit aliquis ex hiis angelis ad tentorium quod movetur et invenit natam dominam et magnitudine auctam, prout antea dixit vobis. Et invenit ibi intus similiter pannos se auro et de perlis et lapidibus preciosis, qui ad opus domine pro se induendo nati et facti sunt et in omnibus preparari. For an analogue to Spenser's "vegetative growth of forms', and a possible source of the notion, the Variorum Spenser (ed. Greenlaw, etc., iii (1934), p. 346) refers us to Pico's comment on a poem Spenser certainly read and used, Benivieni's Cannona. In Benivieni's poem, the archetypal Ideas are represented as "living leaves' apparently growing out of the Angelic Mind, or Logos: Quando dal vero ciel converso, scende Nell'angelical mente el divin sole, Che la sua prima prole Sotto le vive fronde illustra e'nforma, - Lei, ch'el suo primo ben ricerca et vuole Per innato disio che quell'accende, In lui reflessa prende Virtù, che'l ricco sen depinge et forma. (IL 57*0 Pico's gloss upon the words "vive fronde' are, in Stanley's translation of 165 5 (in Platonick Discourse upon Love, ed. E. G. Gardner, 1914): The Métaphore of Leaves relates to the Orchard of Jupiter, where these Ideas were planted (lib. 2, sect. 10) : "Enliven'd' [i.e. vive] as having in themselves the principle of their operation, Intellection, the noblest life. His scholium to "illustra e'nforma' rims: To adorn denotes no more than accidentali perfection, but Ideas are the Substance of the Minde, and therefore he adds, "bestowing form' ; which though they come from without, she received not as accident, but as her first intrinsecai act. This latter note does perhaps adumbrate the notion of clothing for the beings which grow as fruit upon plants. We are here in a very different dimension of expression from that in the Liber Scala , though the world-view underlying the neo-Platonic texts and that of the Moslem eschatologies are not so different that a poetic symbiosis of the two should be considered absurd.</page><page sequence="15">English Analogues to the Liber Scala 35 B: It deserves noting that the account of the fall of the angels in c. lx of the Scala has in common with Milton's three of its features: that it is related to a mortal by an archangel - in this case Gabriel, and not Raphael - that the devils find themselves chained down, and that there is 'darkness visible' in Hell. (The usually-cited parallel to the last, in the description of the Naples tunnel in Seneca's Epistle lvii is facetious in context and tone and without numinous intention: the writer is referring to torches 'quae nobis praestant non ut per tenebras videamus, sed ut ipsas'i) The passage in the Scala contains the following: Sciatis enim quod in hac terra est sedes et habitacio dyaboli ac regnum ipsius. Ibi namque sunt ejus exercitus atque gentes. Verumptamen ipse nichilominus ligatus existit. Nam, ab inicio quo ipse inobediens fuit Deo, boni angeli ejecerunt ipsum et socios suos de celo; et eum ceperunt postmodum et cathenis ferreis ligaverunt unam manuum ante alteram retro; et similiter in eandem maneriem pedes ejus. Et sic ipse hac terra septima est ligatus. Est autem ita magnus quod, in loco in quo est, attingit ipse cum capite suo terram istam in quia sumus; et, cum suis duobus cornibus, que habet, penetrai supra eum. The flaming darkness is part of the description of Satan's castle: Et post tenebras istas est quoddam Castrum, ubi diaboli sedes manet . . . nam muri, turres, menia [French: les creneaux] et domus omnes castri hujusmodi sunt de igne valde nigro, qui ardet continue in se ipso.
