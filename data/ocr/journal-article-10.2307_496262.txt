<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAx OHNEFASCH-RICHTER.--Kypros, the Bible and Homer. Oriental civilization, art and religion in ancient times. Elucidated by the author's own researches and excavations during twelve years' work in Cyprus. 2 vols. 4to, pp. Ix, 530; plates ccxviiI. Asher &amp; Co., London, 1893. This work is a veritable corpus for the illustration of Cypriote an- tiquities. It may not portray as fine a series of monuments as those described in the unfinished Descriptive Atlas of the Cesnola collection, but it will be more useful to the archaeologist, for it is the result of labors conducted in a more systematic and scientific manner. One has merely to turn over the pages of either volume to be impressed with the prodigious labor of the indefatigable excavator and recorder. Perhaps the best method of setting before our readers the scope of the work will be to publish a table of its contents. This we do the more willingly since the book itself, though provided with an excel- lent geographical and general index, is unaccompanied by a table of contents. We retain the author's varied spelling of proper names and use of capital letters. Chapter 1. Ancient Places of Worship in Cyprus.

A comparison of the festivals of Oriental vegetation divinities with those of southern and northern Europe. Appendix II. Gold objects found in Cyprus. By Herr Direktor Frauberger. Explanations of the plates. A table of contents such as this speaks for itself. We have before us an immense accumulation of material, so much so that we weary with the volume, however much we may be interested in its contents. We do not need to know the names of all who contributed in any way to the production of the volume; and yet in his preface Dr. Richter bows his acknowledgments to no less than sixty-eight scholars and museum directors, draughtsmen and photo-chemists, as if each one would feel himself the more complimented by being in- cluded in so large a company. The same lack of selective ability permeates the volume. We ap- preciate the difficulty of handling so large a mass of material, of seizing the important characteristics, of instituting proper comparisons and of forming stable generalizations, and we are grateful for the amount of order which is here brought into a great chaos of antiquity. Descriptive material, though relegated to a section by itself (explana- tion of the plates) nevertheless occupies a considerable portion of the text and numberless monuments are set before us, like sand upon the seashore, not thoroughly co-ordinated. In spite of the excellent and elaborate analysis exhibited in the table of contents many subjects are not exhausted under their proper headings. We are referred again</page><page sequence="5">74 AMER(AN JOURNAL OF ARCHEOLOGY. and again to a continuation of the same subject under other sections, and finally, as if in despair, to the general index. The number of illustrations is also so great, more than two thousand, and the refer- ences to them so constant, that one wishes that more illustrations had found their way into the text, leaving fewer to be sought for in the plates. The labor of finding the illustrations is increased in many cases by wrong references. We have not sought to correct them all, but may mention that in addition to those corrected by the author under the heading "errata and additions" wrong references to figured illustration may be found on pages 43, 53, 60, 63, 69, 74, 76, 87, 94, 95, 100, 107, 108, 122, 137, 149, 152, 234, 291, 292, 306. This is only one of many directions in which the proof reading is very carelessly done. Another result of being overmastered by his material is the frequency with which the train of thought is broken and disconnected. One example of this will suffice. On page 199 we are told that it can be proved of certain cultus statues that they originally held a spear in their hands. We naturally look for the evidence which might easily be given, but the current of thought is immediately checked and our attention is called to the subject of sphinxes. The reader will be con- stantly subjected to such little disappointments. This style of writing reminds us of ancient reliefs, in which the sculptor abhorring a vacuum fills every available space and emphasizes the important figures by making them larger than the rest. So our author, having spread be- fore us a mass of facts with little literary perspective resorts to widely- spaced or heavily-leaded type whenever he wishes to impress the reader with the importance of his remarks. Dr. Richter's archmological, as distinguished from literary, perspect- ive is much greater. He sees the antiquities of Kypros in their relations to Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations and especially, as the title of the book indicates, to Palestine and ancient Greece. The archceological vistias he sets before us are certainly inspiring and en- lightening. But even in this direction he too frequently drops his archaeological telescope and, viewing objects as individuals rather than as members of a historical series, he records meaningless, accidental resemblances, when more natural and historical analogies are before his very eyes. Thus on page 180, wishing to explain as sun rays a form on the gold foil shrine from Mykenai, he refers back to fig. 12 (containing forms without any analogy) and explains as " sun's rays " that which on page 84 he had carefully shown to be " twisted twigs or myrtle ropes." On page 110 he gives to fig. 133 an important position as illustrating a supposed transition between tree and anthropomorphic worship. The supposed resemblance of this sacred tree to a " human</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS AND NOTICES OF BOOKS. 75 form wearing a massive crown and terminating in tendrils" is the same kind of resemblance which Vitruvius found between the Ionic column with its volutes and the figure of a woman with her curls. Now he sees phallic emblems in cases where the evolution from tree to post is evident from his own proofs, and again, dropping the phallic theory when it would seem most applicable, he likens such stones as those represented in figs. 152-155 to " columns " and " stone chisels." He speaks (p. 74) of the papyrus as a " tree most prominent on Egyp- tian monuments," but shows (pp. 105, 106, 125) that he confuses it with the lotus. A careful study of Prof. Goodyear's writings would clear up more than one misinterpretation of Cypriote forms. He claims to be able to classify Cypriote monuments chronologically even to decades, but makes use of such knowledge most sparingly, preserving a proper vagueness when not resting his chronology upon the conclusions of others. He speaks of Kypros as a great caldron, in which divinities and myths are fused. This may justify his use of such compounds as "the Duzi-Tammuz-Adonis-Osiris-Harpokrates -child " (poor child !), but does it justify his fusing together two indi- viduals of to-day, as when he speaks (p. 241) of a votive figure being found by Cesnola-Stern ? This suggests the possibilities of discoveries having been made by Cesnola-Richter, but the great caldron has not yet given evidence of such a fusion. In conclusion we may add that though as a composition the book leaves something to be desired and the opinions require to be reorganized before they can be considered as science, and though a disagreeable, personal vanity soils many of its pages, we nevertheless welcome these volumes as by far the most important contribution yet made to Cypriote archmeology and congrat- ulate the author on the completion of what he himself calls his " first great work."
