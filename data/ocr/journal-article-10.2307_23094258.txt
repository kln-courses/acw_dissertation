<plain_text><page sequence="1">96 Book Reviews Shelley's "Prometheus UnboundA Critical Reading, by Earl R. Wasserman. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1965. Pp. 222. $5.50. The first thirty pages of this important book pull together the author's previous arguments, especially in The Sublimer Language, 1959, concerning Shelley's epistemology. The rest of the book applies to Prometheus Unbound the con clusions and methods of the earlier studies. We must summarize in turn: Al though Shelley never altered his belief in Necessity, the inevitable succession of cause and effect, he passed rapidly from materialism through a pantheistic dualism to the " monistic subjective idealism " of belief in " the absolute, unmedi ated identity of the human perceiving mind and its perceptions." The world as we know it is "an assemblage of thoughts" (p. 24). Convinced that mind can create nothing, Shelley denied the existence of a creative mind either within or beyond our world. In phrases like "speech created thought" (PU II.iv.72), created means "shaped" (p. 20). To imagine is to combine, to organize (p. 55). Since the One Mind cannot create, there must be some extra-mental actuating causality. Declaring that Shelley never brought together in one treatise or one poem his repertory of absolutes, Wasserman distinguishes them sharplyâ€”" the One Mind, the one actuating cause, and the one shaping force" (p. 30). Apply these absolutes to the poem: " The essential subject ... is the One Mind; the extra-mental actuating power is the source of its events; and the drama is the history of the One Mind's evolution into perfection" (p. 31). Prometheus is the One Mind (p. 34, qualified on p. 195). Jupiter is tyranny, "the distorted reflection of Prometheus" (p. 47). Demogorgon, occupying the realm of potentiality, is the actuating Power whose law of Necessity operates in our world of being and perception (p. 129). Earth, a constituent of the One Mind, speaks throughout Act I in the language of erroneous mankind, "which postulates the illusory distinction between earth and mind" (p. 52), in conse quence of the disorder that resulted when the One Mind yielded its powers to "the anthropomorphic God made in the image of Prometheus" (p. 38). To describe Demogorgon as the ultimate Power and to see Prometheus as the One Mind encompassing all that man perceives as reality is effectively to banish Platonic reality and indeed all forms of neoplatonism from the poem. Demo gorgon has no master. On a graph, however, his power would appear vertically limitless but horizontally limited, in that other kinds of power do not derive from Demogorgon. He is assigned, not to a trinity of three-in-one, but to a troika of three disjunct equals. Up through Demogorgon, this latest allegorical alignment of roles is an essentially consistent development from the negative premises of C. E. Pulos' book of 1954, The Deep Truth. At the next step, the argument reaches a thinner bridge. As in almost all previous interpretations, Asia remains Love. The customary distinction, derived from Plato, between the earthly Aphrodite and the heavenly Urania is again denied, as it was in Professor Wasserman's identification of the Urania of Adonais as "the spirit of organic life" (The Subtler Language, p. 352). The structure of the poem " embodies the interdependence of the One Mind and life-giving Love" (p. 74). Love is the ideal state of the One Mind. Only when Prome theus recalled his curse could Asia start toward the realm of ultimate Power, but Asia alone can act as intermediary between being and potentiality (p. 133). Demogorgon, awakened by Asia, withdraws Jupiter from reality into potentiality,</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 97 whence Jupiter may return upon any future disorder in the One Mind. The ultimate source and compelling energy of perfection "is not brought onto the stage as a dramatic character or as part of the action" (p. 57). How does the strict distinction of uncreative mental being from the ultimate Power that re leases the law of Necessity enable Shelley to account for the peculiarly potent status of Love? Wasserman's answer, as I interpret him, is even simpler than the Platonic explanations he replaces: "it is not evident that he [Shelley] ever considered the question" (p. 30). Certainly we are no better oif for learning that Love "obviously has affiliations, beyond the realm of being, with the primal Power" (p. 176). What affiliations? Elsewhere in the book, also, the word obviously carries the burden of persua sion, but the methods of arguing are of no importance at all if the exegesis serves better than competing interpretations for our understanding of the drama. The book is no less valuable where the blurrings in its argument are separable from Shelley's blurrings. If we get little help with Thetis, the problematic multiplicity or identity of several caves and several putti associated with the Earth, or the passage on Zoroaster (1.191-209), Wasserman compensates by help with Act III, sc. ii (Ocean and Apollo on Atlantis), the "unseasonable seasons," Panthea's dreams, and the Spirit of the Earth, who is said to speak for Earth in the perfected world of Act IV but "obviously performs . . . the role of Eros, or Cupid" (pp. 72 f.). The kind of eternity involved in the funeral procession bearing "Time to his tomb in eternity" (IV. 14), which troubled Milton Wilson, is explained as the third of three kinds of eternity present in the poem. It is the replacement of hastening time in erring human minds by "the temporal approximation of time lessness," the " boundlessness of mental duration" when the encompassing One Mind approaches perfection (pp. 211 f.). The allegorical personages act out a myth, described as one combining a con flation of earlier myths and the ironic inversion of specific literary loci of those myths. The conflation (like some of the ironic inversion) has been remarked on by others; Wasserman concentrates on ironic reversals of Aeschylus, Virgil (Eclogue VI and Aeneid VI), Boccaccio on Demogorgon, miscellaneous conveyors of classical mythology, the Christ story, and well-worn prophetical passages of the Bible. Much of this is the world of Virgil's scholiasts and Lempriere's Bibliotheca Classica, laid before us in a laudable effort to deny the privacy of Shelley's symbols. The details are both interesting in themselves (that is, usable for other interpretations) and made integral to the present exegesis, so that even the parallels already available in L. J. Zillman's variorum edition gain by a new twist of subtlety as well as by segregation from conflicting suggestions. Restoring to the Renaissance the metaphor of exhalations from the breathing earth, Wasserman sometimes ignores and sometimes rejects the applicability of refinements by scientists of Shelley's day closely studied by Carl Grabo, P. H. Butter, and others. He praises and utilizes, as one must, G. M. Matthews' article, " A Volcano's Voice in Shelley." The reader's familiarity with aspects of the poem other than the ironical is assumed throughout. In contrast with other studies of Shelley's myth-making, the procedure is historical, in that all the parallels called upon could have been available to Shelley. It is textual not only in its close reading but also in its appeals to the manuscripts for modification of previous readings. But the author's</page><page sequence="3">98 Book Reviews great strength lies far from the copying of manuscripts. This book, like The Finer Tone and The Subtler Language, displays a mind of sharp distinctions and compelling force. In the next few years it will be read, admired, and quoted by students who will not read, admire, or quote Shelley's poem with equal avidity. Columbia University Carl Woodring</page></plain_text>
