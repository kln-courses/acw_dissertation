GREG (Sub-Editor) Vol. V. April 1902 No. 1. MONTAIGNE'S PHILOSOPHY. Many lists of the Hundred Best Books have been drawn up of recent years, but much as they may differ in other respects, there does not appear to have been a single instance in which the compiler has ever omitted the name of Michael Ey quern, Lord of Montaigne, the author of the famous Essays. And rightly so, for not only was he the first, but he remains the best, of the numerous writers who have since attempted that branch of literature. In fact, it would not be overstating the case to affirm, with- out disrespect to Kabelais, that no single French work has ever exercised so great and lasting an influence on the writings and thought of the world, or held its place more constantly and universally in the public esteem in spite of all revolutions of taste and criticism. What can be the reason for this remarkable unanimity ? Setting aside the intrinsic value of the Essays themselves, which in itself is the principal cause, one is naturally attracted by the fascinating desultoriness and disorder which Mon- taigne's charming musings present. They have the same advantage which Montaigne himself liked so much in Plutarch's Morals. They can be taken up and laid aside at leisure, opened at random and read, with- VOL. V. out any effort. And because the subject of Montaigne's book is himself, is it not very flattering for the majority of us to verify, at every page, our likeness to so great a man because we too cannot saddle a horse or have a bad memory 1 The gauloiserie or riskiness of certain passages has likewise sometimes been alleged as a further proof. By the end of Elizabeth's reign the Essays had been introduced to the English public in Florio's translation, which appeared only eight years after the complete French edition, and from that day till now he has always remained a favourite, if not with the mass of English readers, at all events with the bulk of educated men. Shake- speare, Bacon especially, Sterne, Charles Lamb, and Addison, all knew their Mon- taigne well. They all felt the peculiar charm of his originality. Another reason also which attracted them, and which applies to all English readers is, as M. Stapfer has shown, that the English character and that of Montaigne are not without a certain affinity ; they were i cousins,' to use the expression of Montaigne, who on more than one occasion -has given his reader ta understand that the family of Eyquem was A</page><page sequence="2">2 THE MODERN LANGUAGE QUARTERLY of English origin. Though there is no real evidence in favour of that supposition, his love of independence, his practical wisdom, and his cool-headedness are certainly char- acteristic of the race, so that it does not seem altogether unwarrantable to conclude that Eyquem is merely a corruption of some such name as Eyham or Higham, the more so as Montaigne expressly states that his name was still known in England in his day. At first sight it would appear, seeing that no other writer has told us so much about himself as the author of the Essays, that nothing could be easier than to form * an accurate opinion of his work and the ideas it contains; yet, in a physiognomy so complex, it is not surprising that so many critics have been deluded by adhering solely to certain prominent and clearly marked features. Moreover, they had to contend against popular tradition, against the Montaigne legend. For, just as there is a Rabelais legend, so also is there a Montaigne legend, which was started by Pascal and continued, for reasons of his own, by Victor Cousin, who could or would only see a sceptic or an egoist in the great moralist. Is it not as a sceptic that he figures in Emerson's gallery of Representa- tive Men ? In order properly to understand the ideas of Montaigne it is necessary in the first place to inquire what was his object in writing the Essays. The sole end which he had in view was to make the knowledge of himself the basis of a knowledge of human nature, and from thence to deduce a rule of conduct, or rather a lesson, for the good of mankind. Montaigne took himself as an ' example of average human- ity,7 and by exposing himself to view he does as much for the rest of us ; every man recognises himself in him as in a mirror wherein all faces are reflected, because a single man can, as it were, sum up the fundamental identity of humanity. He draws our attention not to particular detail, but to universal characteristics, and invites us to discover beyond the super- ficial mobility of appearances those gener- alities which men have in common. But why try to explain when Montaigne is there to help us 1 ' Authors have hitherto communicated themselves to the people by some particular and foreign mark ; I, the first of any, by my universal being; as Michael de Montaigne, not as a grammarian, a poet, or a lawyer.' Bearing this in mind, one is not likely to join with Pascal in blaming Montaigne for the foolish pro- ject' he had of depicting himself, for by depicting himself he depicts us, and hence it is that he differs so materially from those who have written confessions. He did just the opposite of Rousseau in his Confessions. He presents himself in his universal being, not as a special and unique type of man deserving of pity or admiration, but as a picture of humanity in which the majority of men can recognise themselves. Con- trast Montaigne's words with the following inflated declaration of Rousseau : * Moi seul je sens mon cœur et je connais les hommes. Je ne suis fait comme aucun de ceux que j'ai vus; j'ose croire n'être fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent.' The resolve to probe himself to the utter- most seems to have grown on Montaigne but gradually, the earlier Essays being merely scattered points of his reading: * some of my first essays have a somewhat exotic taste,' but as years went by he became more self-conscious and more inde- pendent, more determined to show himself to the reader with all his failings and defects 'in so far as public reverence allowed him.' It must be confessed that public reverence allowed him much, sometimes too much latitude, for some of his confessions are revolting to the modern reader, and all the more so because they appear to be quite unnecessary. Montaigne was so bent on ' espying himself,' and 'hungered so much to know himself,' from the day he retired to his library till his death, that we can more readily overlook certain irrelevant though harmless details about his own personality which he scatters broadcast throughout his charming 'reveries.' Thus he tells us that he preferred to dress all in white or all in black ; that when a child he did not care for sugar, preserves, or pastry (!) ; that he liked sauces, underdone meat, salt meat, melons and fish, 'making my fasts feasts and my feasts fasts ' ; that he only drank during meals, and often used to bite his tongue; that his beard was chestnut colour ; that he hated smoke - and a thousand other details. Montaigne's sole study then was the nature of man. It remains to be seen what are the conclusions which he arrived at as the result of his indefatigable inquiry. To get at the root of Montaigne's philo- sophy, or at all events the negative part of that philosophy, none of his essays can compare in importance with the famous twelfth chapter of the second book. This essay, which bears the ironical title of an Apology for Raimond Sebond (a sixteenth-</page><page sequence="3">MONTAIGNE'S PHILOSOPHY 3 century Spanish theologian, whose Theologia Naturalis Montaigne had, in 1561, translated at his father's request), is nothing but an eloquent and vehement diatribe against the worth of human understanding and reason, in so far as metaphysical and scientific matters are concerned. Sebond's object was 'by human and natural reasons to establish and verify against Atheists all the articles of the Christian religion.' Montaigne's object was to show the impossibility of such a task, and more generally, by bringing home to man his nothingness, to compel him to acknowledge that truth can only be attained through the medium of faith and of revelation The pride of his reason is the bane of man's existence, and it is only by demon- strating to him its vanity and emptiness that he can be brought to humility, the only sovereign remedy for all our ills and woes: 'The means that I shall use,' says Montaigne, 'and that I think most proper to subdue this frenzy, is to crush and spurn under foot pride and human arrogance, to make them sensible of the inanity, vanity, and vileness of man ; to wrest the wretched arms of their reason out of their hands ; to make them bow down and bite the ground under the authority and reverence of the Divine Majesty.' It is not enough to allege divine proofs such as St. Paul's words to the Colossians or to the Corinthians ; men must be met and defeated on their own ground, whipped at their own expense, for they will not suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself. And then begins the brilliant, and in parts paradoxical, onslaught against human understanding and reason. By what right can we* claim superiority over animals 1 Have they not a speech of their own just as much as we have ? Are they not free agents as well as mankind Ì Brutes are no more slaves than are men themselves. The strength of man is inferior to that of other animals. Animals are capable of being instructed, and here the author of the Essays quotes a string of animal-tales which he had culled from the classics or the old bestiaires, and which must not be taken too seriously. We do not mean of course from our point of view, but from that of Montaigne, who was apt at times to be a bit of a wag - even in the most serious and solemn undertakings. It is something to have shown that he can claim no superiority over animals, but we must still further 'trample under foot this foolish vanity, and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions are founded. So long as man shall believe he has any means and power of himself, he will never acknowledge what he owes to his Maker ; his eggs shall always be chickens, as the saying is : we must therefore strip him to his shirt,' and Montaigne continues the process of un- dressing mercilessly. Take the most learned among the philoso- phers, whether Academicians, Pyrrhonists, or Dogmatists, and listen to them discours- ing on the nature of God, ' since our vanity wishes to make even the Divinity pass through our sieve.' Thaïes, who first in- quired into matters of this sort, believed God to be a Spirit that made all things of water; Anaximander, that the gods were always dying and entering into life again ; and that there were an infinite number of worlds ; Anaximenes, that the air was God, that he was all-creating and immense, ever moving. Anaxagoras was of opinion that the order and manner of all things were conducted by the power and reason of an infinite intelligence. Alcmseon gave divinity to the soul of man and to the sun, moon, and stars. Pythagoras made God a spirit, spread over the nature of all things, whence our souls are extracted; Parmenides, a circle surrounding the heaven, and sup- porting the world by the ardour of light, etc., etc. 'Trust to your philosophy, my masters,' exclaims Montaigne triumphantly, ' and brag that you have found the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here Avith so many philosophical heads ! ' Philo- sophers are just as much at sea when they dogmatise on the immortality of the soul or its nature. But what irritates Montaigne most of all is what has since been termed anthropomorphism, that tendency we have of representing God as a man, and of con- sidering man as the centre of all things, and the favourite for whom all things con- spire. When we pretend to figure the nature of God, what do we do else than draw our own picture on a magnificent scale 1 When we say, for example : * We have life, reason, and liberty ; we esteem goodness, charity, and justice : these quali- ties are then in Him.' ' In conclusion, building and destroying, the conditions of the Divinity, are forged by man, according as they relate to himself. What a pattern, and what a model ! Let us stretch, let us raise and swell human qualities as much as we please : puff up thyself, poor man, yet more and more, and more : " Non si tu ruperis, inquit." '</page><page sequence="4">4 THE MODERN LANGUAGE QUARTERLY Another form which this mania takes is by referring everything to man, to see and to feel ourselves worshipped by the whole universe : ' For us are the destinies ; for us the world; it shines, it thunders for us; creator and creatures, all are for us : 'tis the mark and point to which the univer- sality of things aims.' Even so, but may not a goose say thus : ' All the parts of the universe I have an interest in : the earth serves me to walk upon ; the sun to light me ; the stars have their influence upon me : I have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters ; there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me ; I am the darling of Nature ! Is it not man that keeps, lodges, and serves me?' Of scientific knowledge, 'the fooleries of human wisdom/ Montaigne speaks with the same supreme disdain. The famous Ptolemseus had fixed the limits of our world, but unfortunately, Montaigne remarks coolly, in our own century an ' infinite ex- tent of land has just been discovered.' For the science of medicine and its practitioners he has nothing but angry words, which is not to be wondered at when we recall that they had killed his bosom friend La Boetie, ' a friend who was worth more than the whole crowd of them put together.' Look at their cabbalistic and mysterious airs and their choice drugs ! * The left foot of a tor- toise, the urine of a lizard, the dung of an elephant, the liver of a mole, blood drawn from under the wing of a white pigeon ; and for us who have the stone (so scornfully they use in our miseries), the excrements of rats beaten to powder, and such-like apes' tricks.' Nor can Montaigne be accused of leniency towards the astrologers and astronomers of his time, ' those people who ride astride upon the epicycle of Mercury.' Lately Copernicus established the theory of the movement of the earth, though for thousands of years it had been held that it was the sun and not the earth which moved. ' Who knows if in another thousand years a third doctrine will not be set up and over- throw the two others ? And what shall we have to learn from that fact except that it is indifferent to us which is the right one,' Montaigne exclaims, thereby implying that even scientific research is a fallacy. Nor does knowledge increase either our happi- ness or usefulness in this life. We do not know that the two most learned men of antiquity, the Greek Aristotle and the Roman Yarro, had 'any peculiar excellence in their lives.' The sum of this excellence is not to be found among the so-called educated men, but among the poor and lowly, those that are absolutely ignorant, of an ' abecedarian ignorance,' or among those higher and nobler souls, who after long striving have arrived at the conclusion that they know nothing, and cannot know anything, and who are best defined by Montaigne's graceful comparison : ' The same has fallen out to men truly wise, which befalls the ears of corn ; they shoot and raise their heads high and pert, whilst empty ; but when full and swelled with grain in maturity, begin to flag and droop. So men having tried and sounded all things, and having found in that mass of knowledge and provision of so many various things, nothing solid and firm, and nothing but variety, have quitted their presumption, and acknowledged their natural condition.' Those two classes in their modesty and humility are good citizens and true Chris- tians : ' a blank paper prepared to receive such forms from the finger of God as He shall please to write upon it,' but the men of the first class, the ' mongrels of society, who have disdained the first form of the ignorance of letters, and have not been able to attain the other (sitting betwixt two stools),' are dangerous and discontented disturbers of the peace, who pretend they know everything and wish to improve on all things: 'over-vigilant wits, that will ever be prating of divine and human causes.' The desire of knowledge is the curse of mankind. Thus we must become more ignorant in order to become wiser, which is precisely the conclusion arrived at by Pas- cal, but with less fervour and vehemence. In legislation and politics also, the affairs of this world stand on no solid basis. Nothing is constant here below, and in this everlasting change, man is the most change- able element : ' a subject marvellously vain, diverse, and wavering.' Everything is rela- tive, and accordingly we should not refuse to see our fellow-creatures in the men who are not governed as we are, who do not pray or speak as we do, or dress in the same way. Is it reasonable to slaughter savages because, forsooth, they wear no breeches 1 And is not the infatuation monstrous which makes a man kill another because the latter does not happen to share his opinions ? It will be noticed that all the things that Montaigne calls in question are precisely those which from all time have fanned the passions of men and been mainly respon- sible for all strife and discord, which is equivalent to saying that Montaigne offers</page><page sequence="5">MONTAIGNE'S PHILOSOPHY 5 scepticism as a remedy for fanaticism. Whosoever removes the cause removes also the effect, and to achieve this is the ideal aimed at by one who, like the author of the Essays, would do almost anything rather than be worried. But Montaigne's scepticism is not uni- versal, and if he took so much care to remove everything which can in any way mar our existence here below, it was because he was convinced that life on this earth was not only worth living to him who knew himself, but that it was the * funda- mental and most illustrious of our occupa- tions,' and the only one that repaid the trouble. ' The great and glorious masterpiece of a man is to know how to live suitably. ' How is man to perform this * biggest task of all ' ? The best and safest plan is to follow * our great and powerful mother Nature,' whose unspoken counsels lie dormant in the bosom of every uncorrupted man, urging him to seek pleasure and to avoid pain with dis- crimination and moderation. As though conscious of the sweeping accusations of scepticism which might be subsequently brought against him, Montaigne has en- deavoured in the concluding pages of his Essays to remove all doubt from his reader's mind and to leave this part of his philo- sophy quite clear : ' For my part, then, I love life, and cultivate it, such as it has pleased God to bestow it upon us. I do not desire that it should be without the necessity of eating and drinking. ... I accept kindly, and without acknowledg- ment, what nature has done for me ; am well pleased with it and proud of it. ... Nature is a gentle guide, but not more gentle than prudent and just ; I hunt after the print of her foot throughout. . . . 'Tis an absolute, and, as it were, a divine perfection, for a man to know how loyally to enjoy his being.' How far removed from a sceptic's profession of faith ! And even if this express declaration be not sufficient to dispose once and for all of the Montaigne legend, there is further testimony for its disproof in his two essays on Education, in his passionate admiration of the heroes of antiquity, or, still better, in his ever- memorable pages on friendship. Though his belief in the divinity and goodness of Nature showed Montaigne to be, like Rabelais, a true child of the Renais- sance, yet he may be even more fittingly described as a precursor of the great Jean- Jacques himself. Like Rousseau, but with more good sense and moderation, he dis- courses on the supposed happiness of the natural condition of savages ; and in an- other passage, which might have been written by his illustrious successor himself, he gives an enthusiastic description of a certain valley at the foot of the Pyrenees where his uncle was Vicar, the inhabitants of which were once innocent and happy, living without judges, lawyers, or doctors, curing all their diseases with garlic, till the day when our civilisation, with all its atten- dant ills, was introduced among them. But man has so completely falsified and complicated the original state of nature, ' confounding it with artificial traces,' that to enjoy one's being loyally' has become an art the aim of which consists in re- discovering nature. This end can be best attained, in the first place, by being inde- pendent, not only of all such things as pass our understanding, but also of all passions. Let us also be free with regard to all forms of social life : to detach oneself is to free oneself. We can lend ourselves, but must never give ourselves up wholly. In the second place we must learn how to die, or rather to bear the idea of death, for death itself is nothing, and there is nothing more natural. This can be done by continually meditating on death and practising those of her ' avenues ' which fall within the bounds of experience ; but the best plan is to try to realise the brute resignation of the * rustic crowd,' those * poor people that we see scattered about prone and intent upon their business, that neither know Aristotle nor Cato, example nor precept : ever from these does Nature every day extract effects of constancy and patience, more pure and firm than those who so inquisitively study in the schools. How many do I ordinarily see who slight poverty Ì How many that desire to die, or that die without alarm or regret Ì He that is now digging in my garden has this morning buried his father or his son. The very names by which they call diseases sweeten and mollify the sharpness of them : the phthisic is with them no more than a cough, the dysentery but a looseness, a pleurisy but a cold, and as they gently name them, so they lightly endure them ; they are very great and grievous indeed when they hinder their ordinary labour, and they never keep their beds but to die : Simplex ilia et aperta virtus in obscuram et sollertem scientiam versa esV The enemy of life is not death but pain, and therefore we must flee from it at any cost, when possible : ' For my part I am of</page><page sequence="6">6 THE MODERN LANGUAGE QUARTERLY this mind, and by whatever means one could shield oneself from blows, were it under a calf's skin, I am not the man to shrink from it ; for all I want is to pass my time pleasantly and at my ease.' Finally, it should be noticed that Mon- taigne's religious and political opinions are in keeping with his conception of life, of which the keynote was : * All the glory that I pretend to from my life is to have lived it quietly.' He lived and died a Catholic because he had been so brought up, and condemned the Reformers as pre- sumptuous revolutionists, although he could not excuse the Catholics for burning and butchering them : ' 'Tis setting a man's con- jectures at a very high price, to cause a man to be roasted alive upon them.' In politics likewise he was convinced that the best course was to follow tradition and custom, 'that second nature and no less powerful.' Montaigne was intellectually in sympathy with democratic government, but in practice he defended the cause of royalty, because he happened to have been born in a country where royalty was the form of government. He abhorred all disturbers of the peace, convinced as he was that change invariably brings with it more ill than good : ' Our manners are infinitely cor- rupted, and wonderfully incline to grow worse : of our laws and customs, there are many that are barbarous and monstrous : nevertheless, by reason of the difficulty of reformation and the danger of stirring things, if I could put something under to stay the wheel, and keep it where it is, I would do it with all my heart.' It is evident then that the philosophy of Montaigne is that of a sceptic as regards things metaphysical and religious. But it must be remembered that this attitude is assumed by him in respect to these matters only and as a necessary consequence of his 'art of life,' of which the guiding principle is toleration and peace. We have enough to do to attend to our own lives. What need have we to worry about those things in which there is no certainty or stability ? ' Oh ! what a soft, easy, and wholesome pillow is ignorance and incuriosity, whereon to repose a well-contrived head ! ' L. E. Kastner.</page></plain_text>
