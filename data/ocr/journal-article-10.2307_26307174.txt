McCafferty Department of Anthropology, Brown University, Providence, R1 02912-1921, USA Abstract Chronology is a fundamental prerequisite for problem-oriented, anthropologically relevant archaeology. It is also the shaky foundation that has hampered attempts to reconstruct the culture history of Cholula, Mexico. Cholula is among the oldest continuously occupied urban centers of the New World, yet it remains one of the most enigmatic. This paper evaluates previous cultural sequences for the site, and summarizes recent evidence to construct a chronology using absolute dates and ceramic assemblages from primary depositional contexts. This revised sequence features a clearer understanding of Middle Formative settlement and the definition of ritual and domestic contexts from the Classic period. In addition, there is now evidence for a gradual transition between Late Classic and Early Postclassic material culture; and for the evolution of the Postclassic polychrome tradition within a sequence of short, clearly defined phases. Chronology is one of the key objectives in archaeology. Strong chronologies are those with fairly short divisions defined by dis tinctive artifact assemblages allowing for precise identification of cultural sequences; weak chronologies generally have long peri ods during which the material culture appears uniform. "Static" culture is an anthropological paradox, however, as it is more likely that long periods are the result of inadequate archaeological re finement instead of cultural stagnation. Chronologies with brief, well-defined periods are important stepping stones to understand ing the processes that lead to culture change, and thereby facilitate a wide range of subsequent interpretations. One criticism of the "culture-historical" approach in archaeol ogy, however, has been the overemphasis on chronology building (Binford 1962, 1965; Flannery 1967; Willey and Sabloff 1974), particularly that kind accomplished through seriation and relative dating (Trigger 1989:304-305). The increased use of absolute dating methods (e.g., radiocarbon, obsidian-hydration, and archae omagnetic dating) provides the opportunity to date events rather than simply blocks of time, with the archaeological past therefore becoming more of a continuum than a sequence of static stages (Dean 1978). This ideal has been more successfully achieved in some areas, such as the U.S. Southwest, than in central Mexico where rather coarse chronologies still continue to be used. Not only are Meso american time periods cumbersomely long in duration, but they usually rely on few absolute dates for calibration, and often incor porate assumptions based on ethnohistorical accounts of mythico historical events (Smith 1987). This paper discusses the chronology of Cholula, Puebla, eval uating existing sequences and summarizing available chronomet ric dates and ceramic complexes from recent excavations. Cholula is one of the oldest continuously occupied centers in Mesoamer ica, with settlement dating back at least into the Middle Formative period (ca. 1000 B.C.). It is located in the Puebla-Tlaxcala valley (see Figure 2 in Parsons et al. 1996), a broad plain with outstand ing agricultural productivity and a natural clay source (Bonfil Batalla 1973). Archaeological investigations at Cholula have con tinued for more than 100 years (Bandelier 1976 [1884]; Marquina 1939, 1951, ed. 1970; Messmacher 1967; Mountjoy and Peterson 1973; Suárez C. 1985, 1989; summarized inMcCafferty 1992:51 69; Merlo 1989; Paddock 1987; Peterson 1987; Suárez C. and Mar tinez A. 1993), with particular emphasis on the ceremonial precinct surrounding the Great Pyramid. Yet Cholula remains one of the most enigmatic of Mesoamerican centers, and its poorly under stood chronology is the shaky foundation that has limited attempts to reconstruct its culture history. CHOLULA CHRONOLOGIES: PAST AND PRESENT In 1856, Edward B. Tylor visited Cholula and observed that: though there was plenty of coloured pottery to be found in the neighborhood of the [Great P]yramid, the pyramid itself had only fragments of uncoloured ware imbedded in its structure; which seems to prove that it was built before the art of colour ing pottery was invented (Tylor 1970 [1861]:275). Despite the numerous archaeological investigations that have since been conducted at the site, understanding of the Cholula ce ramic sequence has progressed remarkably little since Tylor's visit. Conflicting sequences proposed by Noguera (1954) and Miiller (1970, 1978) were based primarily on stratigraphic excavations into and around the Great Pyramid. Both scholars were influenced by Valley of Mexico sequences to the extent that they recognized little difference between the cultural sequences of the separate ar eas. Confusion over the Postclassic chronology in particular has had a far-reaching impact on the culture history of Cholula, and 299</page><page sequence="2">300 McCafferty consequently, for all of central Mexico (Nicholson 1982:243 244; Sanders et al. 1979:133; Smith and Heath-Smith 1980:36-37). In addition to the "Mexico-centrism" of the sequences, how ever, there was also a fundamental methodological problem. Since most of the investigations have been conducted at the Great Pyr amid and its surrounding ceremonial precinct, deep test pits were the standard technique used for obtaining stratified ceramic sam ples. But the depositional contexts of these units are badly dis torted by the monumental construction activities at the mound. Examples of the degree of disturbance can be found in the original reports. Noguera (1954:46-49), for example, described and illus trated one unit where the Classic and Postclassic deposits were inverted. The utility of stratigraphic test pits is well documented, yet problems may occur when pits are used without regard for con text or site formation processes, particularly in situations where construction activities involve the extensive use of earthen fill (Schiffer 1987:137-139). The ceramics from Cholula have been the subject of numerous studies (Acosta 1975; Barrientes 1980; Caskey 1982a, 1982b, 1988; Fajardo 1985; Lind 1994; Lind et al. 1990; López V. 1967; Mc Cafferty 1992, 1994, 1997; Müller 1970, 1978, 1981; Noguera 1941, 1954; Peterson 1972; Suárez C. 1994). Yet ambiguities and even contradictions in these studies have resulted in fundamental problems especially for the interpretation of Postclassic assem blages. These difficulties are caused in part by the tremendous di versity within the Cholula ceramic complex. The first systematic study of Cholula ceramics was carried out by Eduardo Noguera (1941, 1954), who analyzed pottery recov ered during the initial phase of explorations at the Great Pyramid. His samples came from stratigraphic pits, tunnel excavations, and block excavations at the Altar of the Carved Skulls. He published the results in La cerámica arqueológica de Cholula (Noguera 1954), which featured numerous illustrations including photographs and color plates. "Archaic" remains were found beneath the Great Pyramid, in a stratigraphically lower position than Classic-period levels (Nogu era 1954:199-200). The earliest pottery featured red paint and in cising over a white base coat, and white decoration over red (Noguera 1954:201). Formative-period figurines were related to the sequence developed by Vaillant (1930, 1931) for the Valley of Mexico. Classic-period ceramics were comparable to those from Teoti huacan, especially from the initial period when Noguera (1954:188) postulates that Cholula was occupied by people ethnically related to those of Teotihuacan. Later developments in Teotihuacan-style ceramics were less noticeable at Cholula, however, suggesting di vergence between the two cultural systems. The characteristic ce ramic type is a burnished gray/brown-to-black vessel with low, concave walls and a flat base, occasionally with small supports. Decoration is rare, most often occurring as incised geometric pat terns. Another decorated type features red and white paint over brown, similar to pottery discovered inside Teotihuacan's Pyramid of the Sun (Noguera 1954:190). Noguera (1954:261, 280-281) divided the Postclassic into three phases on the basis of decorated ceramic types, termed Cholulteca I, II, and III. These phases were loosely correlated with the Valley of Mexico sequence of Aztec I, II, and III, but no absolute dates were assigned to define the periods. Cholulteca I was identified by the presence of polícroma laca and decoración negra sobre el color natural del barro. Cholulteca II was poorly represented, with polícroma mate as its only diagnostic. Cholulteca III was defined by the presence of polícroma firme, decoración sencilla, and dec oración rojo o negro sobre fondo anaranjado. The final occupa tion of the Great Pyramid occurred during the Early Postclassic period, ending about a.d. 1200 (Marquina 1951:119). This date was probably derived from ethnohistoric accounts, supported by the presence of polychrome pottery on the surface of the pyramid. The second major ceramic study was directed by Florencia Müller (1970, 1978; Acosta 1975), as part of the Proyecto Cho lula. The analysis was based on over 2.5 million sherds from strat igraphic pits and features such as burials, wells, and middens (Müller 1978:13). Müller classified the ceramics based on surface treatment and vessel form. Temporal assignment of the different types used rel ative similarities with other areas, particularly the Valley of Mex ico. Thus Formative-period phases at Cholula were identified using Valley of Mexico site names (e.g., Tlatilco and Ticoman), while Classic-period phases were direct transpositions of Teotihuacan phases (Müller 1978:19). The enormous effort of the Proyecto Cholula revised the ce ramic sequence for the Postclassic period, but it retained Nogu era's original phase names of Cholulteca I, II, and III, while adding IV. Furthermore, Müller collapsed the entire polychrome se quence into a single phase (Cholulteca III), thus introducing a ma jor contradiction between the two schemes, as Noguera had defined his different phases on the basis of specific polychrome types. Müller assigned dates to the phases, but without reliance on ar chaeometric dates. Instead, the time periods were apparently adopted directly from historical events in the Valley of Mexico (McCafferty 1992:234-235; Smith 1987:38). For example, Cho lulteca II began in a.d. 900, coincidental with the founding of Tol lan, and lasted until the foundation of Tenochtitlan in a.d. 1325. Cholulteca III was identified with the Mixteca-Puebla horizon, and lasted until a.d. 1500. The method used by Müller is problematic because it assumes a direct correlation between interregional sty listic similarities, ethnohistorically documented political events, and cultural production processes (Smith 1987). The Proyecto Cholula ceramic analysis radically changed the Postclassic ceramic sequence while retaining Noguera's orig inal phase terminology. By considering all assemblages with poly chrome pottery as Late Postclassic, earlier Postclassic assemblages became relatively rare. Consequently, Cholula was interpreted as being abandoned following the Classic period, and only regained its status as an urban center in the later stages of the Postclassic period (Dumond 1972; Dumond and Müller 1972; García Cook 1981; García Cook and Merino Carrión 1990; Mountjoy 1987; Suárez C. and Martinez A. 1993) Excavations on the campus of the Universidad de las Américas (UDLA), located about 2 km east of the Great Pyramid (Figure 1), have produced ceramic sequences and absolute dates useful for revising Noguera's and Müller's chronological sequences. Daniel Wolfman (1968) excavated a series of domestic compounds and associated features at UA-1 that provide a ceramic seriation to clar ify the Postclassic sequence (McCafferty 1992, 1994, 1997). Mountjoy and Peterson (1973; Peterson 1972) investigated For mative, Classic, and Postclassic deposits and obtained the first l4C and obsidian-hydration dates from the site. Michael Lind (1979) excavated a variety of Postclassic features that define the Late Post classic ceramic complex (Barrientes 1980; Caskey and Lind 1979; Lind 1994). Rescue excavations on the campus continue to pro duce important results, including the discovery of a possible Early Formative occupation (Plunket 1992).</page><page sequence="3">Ceramics and chronology of Cholula 301 ; "7- V I / S /N ' v , N / ^ ^ ^ ^ v./ ' ^' v / / 1 *•, ' / v-' -v &gt; !-^^; ^ v^ / r*j : ; : N' N&gt;/ ^/v "/-^ / / ' V' iK,/^ / ^» / ,'v^ ' / 7 ^v^v/V/v/VV 1 Great Pyramid, Tlachihualtepetl 2 Cerro Cocoyo 3 Edificio Rojo 4 Carrito da Guadalupe 5 UA-69 6 UA-70 7 UA-1 8 UA-79 9 Villas Arqueologicas 10 San Andris Formative Midden 11 Translto Site, R-106 12 San Pedro Well 13 Formative Mounds 14 Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl 2- Zocalo Figure I.

Over the past 25 years a series of absolute dates has been ob tained with which to construct Cholula's chronological sequence (Table 1). The total number of dates is still quite small, particu larly because they are distributed across a 2,500-year period, but recent efforts by Sergio Suárez C. and the INAH l4C lab have greatly improved the situation. These dates are useful for calibrat ing the ceramic sequence based on excavated assemblages. In the remainder of this paper I summarize the results of recent investi gations relating to the Formative, Classic, Epiclassic, and Post classic periods. Included are absolute dates within the context of their artifact assemblages, as well as additional excavation data when the ceramic complexes are useful for defining the ceramic sequence. FORMATIVE PERIOD During the Formative Period, Cholula grew from a small lakeside hamlet to a sprawling regional center surrounding its nascent cer emonial precinct. Based on scattered concentrations of Formative artifacts, it appears that Cholula may have covered 2 km2, though the population density cannot be estimated because of later occu pational overburden.1 Initial settlement clustered around the shore of a swampy lake on what is now the UDLA campus, presumably to take advantage of the rich lacustrine environment. Excavations on the grounds of the campus have recovered pottery stylistically similar to Middle Formative ceramics from other regions (Baravalle and Wheaton 1974; Mountjoy and Peterson 1973). In 1969 and 1970, Joseph Mountjoy directed excavations on the UDLA campus at the edge of the "swamp" (Mountjoy and Pe terson 1973:13-19, 46-65). Excavation Units 5 and 6 contained rich deposits of unmixed Formative materials. Decorated pottery resembled that from the transitional and upper phases from Tla tilco, with incised double-line breaks and filled geometric patterns on either black- or white-slipped surfaces. Figurines also related to Formative types from the Valley of Mexico. Waterlogged con ditions created favorable preservation for organic materials, in cluding wood, corn cobs, and maguey spines (Mountjoy and Peterson 1973:59). No architectural features were detected, and this area was interpreted as a refuse dump at the lake's edge. One large piece of carbonized wood from Excavation Unit 6 was dated at 897-765 B.C. (2645 ± 110 b.p.; GX-2256; Mountjoy and Peterson 1973:62). This date seems to be several centuries too early, however, based on stylistic comparisons with ceramics from the Valley of Mexico. Ten obsidian prismatic blades were dated using obsidian-hydration analysis, but the results ranged from 2083 ±118 B.C. to a.d. 149 ± 125. The dates were based on both green and gray obsidian samples without consideration of the possible effects of source on hydration rate. Formative ceramics have been discovered in several other parts of Cholula. Noguera (1956:214) reports pottery and figurines re lating to the Zacatenco I/II phase from the interior of the Edificio Rojo northeast of the Great Pyramid. Similar artifacts were found at the Conejero, an early stage of the ceremonial precinct (Miiller 1973; Suárez C. and Martinez A. 1993). Formative pottery is com mon on the surface beneath the initial levels of the Great Pyramid (Noguera 1954:199-200). A midden deposit from San Andrés Cholula was found during the backhoe excavation of a municipal waterline (McCafferty 1984). It was associated with a cobblestone platform that mea sured about 1 m in height, though only a portion of the structure was exposed in the trench profile. Ceramics included kaolin slipped serving wares (Cholula Cream) decorated with incised, ex cised, and painted motifs (Figure 2). Other decorated pottery had black (Amalucan Polished Black) and brown (Totimehuacan Red on-brown) surfaces, with incised and red-painted designs (Fig ure 3). Figurines correspond to Valley of Mexico types, including Vaillant's Type B-C (Figure 4a; Vaillant 1930:108-109, 124 125) and Niederberger's (1976:211, 217) Pahuacan class from the ' Because of Cholula's location on a valley floor and its 3,000-year settlement history it is a deeply stratified site for which traditional methods of surface reconnaissance are only minimally successful. Early deposits are poorly represented on the surface, and therefore attempts at reconstruct ing diachronic settlement patterns are tentative. Settlement-size estimates presented here are based on surface reconnaissance, observations from deep construction trenches (including a municipal drainage system), and INAH rescate excavations.</page><page sequence="5">Ceramics and chronology of Cholula 303 Figure 2. Examples of Cholula Cream, (a, c-d) Red-on-cream Incised; [b] incised/Excised. Manantial phase (Figure 4b). Additionally, 56 fragments of a dis tinctive form of zoomorphic censer cover were recovered, featur ing an open mouth and a face with pinched ears and indented eyes (see Fowler et al. [1980:38] and Garcia Cook [1981:245] for com parable examples). A large feature excavated at the Hotel Villas Arqueológicas (Cas key 1988) included a rich deposit of Middle Formative artifacts, probably representing domestic refuse. Ceramic types and relative frequencies were very similar to those of the San Andrés midden.2 Caskey (1988:79-80, 142) used this feature to define his "Cabaftas phase," 800-500 B.C. A final Formative-period locus was discovered to the north of the UDLA campus, on what may have been an island in the swampy lake. It featured several possible mounds, though they had been modified to form a modern jagüey (reservoir). Ceramics included kaolin-slipped Cholula Cream with double-line incising in de signs more similar to those from the UDLA excavations than ei ther the San Andrés or Villas Arqueológicas middens. Unfortunately, this site was bulldozed during a land dispute in the early 1980s, and no systematic collections are available. Formative-period ceramics from Cholula represent at least two definable complexes. The earlier features (1) Cholula Cream kaolin slipped pottery with incising, excising, and red paint; (2) Totime huacan Red-on-brown, including incised subtypes; (3) Amalucan Black, with an Incised subtype; and (4) Coapan Monochrome util itarian forms (Table 2; Caskey 1988;McCafferty 1984; also Baravalle and Wheaton 1974). Stylistically, these types are earlier than the dated assemblage from the UDLA campus, and similarities link both the ceramics and figurines with the Valley of Mexico and Chalcatzingo Table 2.

The second complex features complex-silhouette vessels with incised decoration including filled geometric motifs, especially tri angles, on black- and white-slipped vessels (Mountjoy and Peter son 1973; Noguera 1956). Kaolin-slipped pottery is still prominent in the second complex, but decoration is limited to simple incised patterns such as zig-zags and line breaks. This complex may date to the late Middle Formative (700-300 B.C.), although it is asso ciated with the single 14C date from the UDLA excavation that would place it slightly earlier. Late Formative ceramics are known from other sites in the Cho lula region, such as Coapan and Amalucan (Fowler et al. 1980), but thus far are rare at Cholula. An Early Formative complex has been reported from the UDLA campus (Plunket 1992). Addition ally, several mammoth bones have been found in deep deposits, suggesting the possibility of a Paleoindian-period occupation. Classic Period Cholula became a principal religious center during the Classic pe riod, as the Great Pyramid went through three major construction stages until it measured 350 m on a side and 66 m in height (Fig ure 5; Marquina 1970, 1975; McCafferty 1996). Cultural remains of the city cover about 4 km2, though most of this area is beneath later Postclassic and Historic occupations. Several additional py ramidal mounds stand out like islands in a sea of modern devel opment, including Cerro Cocoyo, the Cerrito de Guadalupe, and an adobe nucleus that has been stripped of its original facade. Relatively little attention has been paid to subdividing the Clas sic period. Müller and Noguera both adopted ceramic sequences from the Valley of Mexico, noting the "impoverished" nature of Cholula's ceramic assemblage (Dumond and Müller 1972:1209). The diagnostic pottery type is Tepontla Burnished Gray/brown, which usually occurs as serving wares that range in color from Figure 4.

The structure could not be completely delimited due to intrusive dis turbances (such as a large Colonial midden). The house featured plaster-covered adobe walls over a thick stucco floor. Excavation units through the upper floor encountered three additional floor levels. A stone-lined tomb was associated with the earliest floor level, but it was later reopened to inter a second individual prior to surfacing the final floor level. Grave offerings from the tomb in cluded six vessels (including a small olla with gadrooning, coffee bean appliqués, and nubbin supports), greenstone beads, and several figurines. Four 14C samples date the construction sequence of the struc ture. Charcoal samples recovered from sealed contexts above the lower floor in Pozos 5-2 and 2-1 dated to a.d. 408-544 (1579 ± 66 b.p.; INAH-1340), and a.d. 437-640 (1490 ± 61 B.P.; INAH 1338), respectively. A sample from above the capstone of the tomb in Pozo 5-1 dated to a.d. 584-645 (1428 ± 35 b.p.; 1NAH-1336). The fourth sample came from obsidian-workshop debris against the outside of the west wall, dated at a.d. 429-575 (1539 ± 49 b.p.; INAH-1339). The depositional sequence therefore spans the Late Classic from about a.d. 400 to 650. Diagnostic artifacts associated with these dates include ceram ics and figurines (Table 3). Tepontla Burnished Gray/brown com prised about 50% of the assemblage, while Teotihuacan Thin Orange made up another 8%. The most distinctive pottery decoration was a diagonal criss-cross motif pattern-burnished onto the exterior of flared-rim conical bowls (Figure 8). Vessels often featured nubbin supports. Ceramics and anthropomorphic figurines correspond to those of the Tlamimilolpa and Xolalpan phases at Teotihuacan. Other Classic-period loci have been excavated that provide ad ditional data for the ceramic sequence. At the Hotel Villas Ar queológicas south of the Great Pyramid, Suárez C. and Caskey (Caskey 1988) excavated a section of a possible house (including a stucco floor and stone-lined hearth) and an associated burial with an extensive offering. The burial pit penetrated through the stucco floor, but no evidence was recovered to suggest that the pit was ever sealed by later construction (Caskey 1988:158). A partial skel eton of an adult male, probably a secondary interment, was found with an offering of 125 complete vessels, two greenstone beads and two other worked stones (Caskey 1988:164). The ceramics were almost all of the monochrome Tepontla Burnished Gray/ brown type, with no examples of Teotihuacan Thin Orange.

Also present were flared-rim conical bowls and hemispherical bowls Figure8. Tepontla Burnished Gray/brown flared-rim, conical bowl with pattern-burnished decoration and nubbin supports. similar to those found at the Transito site. Caskey (1988:232) con cludes that the offering dates to the Protoclassic period (a.d. 0-200). A platform (Structure 3) was discovered at UA-1 from the UDLA campus (Wolfman 1968), and subsequent excavations disclosed a series of related architectural features (Mountjoy and Peterson 1973:22-26, 65-91). Ceramics were identified as Late Formative through Middle Classic, though discrepencies were noted in the correlation of the Cholula materials with the Valley of Mexico se quence (Mountjoy and Peterson 1973:87). Suárez C. (1985) excavated a burial with an offering near the southwest corner of the Great Pyramid at the Patio Abierto above (Structure 2). The skeleton was of an adult male with distinctive tabular oblique cranial deformation and inlaid teeth, both rare traits at Cholula but characteristic of the Maya area (Suárez C. 1985:35). Ten ceramic vessels were associated with the burial. All were of the Tepontla Burnished Gray/brown type, and five were flared rim conical bowls. Two of the vessels were tall vasos similar to those found at the Villas Arqueológicas site. Suárez C. (1985:68 69) dates the burial to the Late Classic period (a.d. 500-700) based on Miiller's (1978) ceramic sequence. A final "context" for interpreting the Classic-period ceramic se quence is the elaborate Bebedores mural from the tablero of Struc ture 3-A-1 of the Patio of the Altars on the south side of the Great Pyramid (Marquina 1971; Müller 1972). The Bebedores mural spans over 50 m in length, and depicts about 100 individuals in the pro cess of ritual drinking. The figures often hold ceramic drinking ves</page><page sequence="10">308 McCafferty Figure 9. Details from Bebedores mural showing vessel forms used by drinkers. seis, and sit next to larger pots holding (presumably) alcoholic and possibly hallucinogenic pulque (Figure 9). Miiller (1972:143) iden tified four vessel forms from her ceramic typology and consequently dated the murals to the Early Classic period (a.d. 100-300).3 Both Caskey (1988:200-202) and Suárez C. (1985:68) relate their Classic-period ceramic complexes to the vessels depicted in the murals and try to justify their temporal framework with the murals. This is particularly true for the vasos found in both assem blages. Miiller (1978:93) dates this form to her "Cholula Ila" phase (a.d. 200-350). But Caskey places the Villas Arqueológicas burial earlier (a.d. 0-200), while Suárez C. (1985:71) dates the Patio Abi erto burial to the Late Classic (a.d. 500-700). If the vasos were used for ritual drinking, then perhaps they were not as temporally sensitive as Miiller originally suggested. This form was not prom inent in domestic debris at the Transito site, however, and was not among the vessels interred as offerings in the tomb. That this ves sel form is used to support periodizations for the Protoclassic and Early and Late Classic phases is indicative of the lack of resolu tion in the Classic-period ceramic chronology. The Classic-period sequence remains indivisible due to a lack of distinctive types or forms. The different assemblages identified at the Transito site were remarkably similar despite the temporal range indicated by the 14C dates. The burial ceramics from the Villas Arqueológicas lacked Thin Orange, but this may be due to the specialized nature of the offering. Vessel forms in the Tepontla 3 Based on a reinterpretation of the construction history of the Patio of the Altars, the Bebedores mural may actually date to the Epiclassic period (McCafferty 1996; see below).</page><page sequence="11">Ceramics and chronology of Cholula 309 Figure 10. Examples of Cocoyotla Black-on-natural [a-b] and Cocoyotla Incised (c-d). Burnished Gray/brown type are relatively consistent, with the ex ception of the vaso form. At present the most likely characteristics that could potentially be useful as diagnostics for future temporal division are nubbin supports and pattern burnished decoration, which were present at the Transito site but absent from both the Villas Arqueológicas offering and the Patio Abierto. Until addi tional assemblages from primary contexts become available for seriation, the Classic period cannot be subdivided into more spe cific phases. Epiclassic Period The most controversial stage in Cholula's history is the transition between the Classic and Postclassic periods, in part because inter pretations have changed through time. Following the initial phase of archaeological investigations, and influenced by ethnohistori cal accounts, Marquina (1951) and Noguera (1954) suggested that Cholula was occupied continuously, with the Great Pyramid aban doned at the end of the Early Postclassic period when Nahua Tolteca-Chichimeca overthrew the "tyranny" of the Olmeca Xicallanca rulers (Chadwick 1971; Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca 1976; Jiménez Moreno 1942, 1966; Olivera and Reyes 1969; Torquemada 1975-1983 [1615]). Investigators from the Proyecto Cholula challenged this theory with evidence that the pyramid, and perhaps the entire city, were abandoned at the end of the Classic period due to a variety of possible factors: volcanic eruption,4 flood ing, and/or social upheaval related to the wider Classic-period "collapse" (Dumond and Miiller 1972; Marquina 1975; Miiller 1970, 1978; Suárez C. and Martinez A. 1993). Under this see nario, nearby Cerro Zapotecas was occupied as a defensible site for refugees from the urban center (Mountjoy 1987; Mountjoy and Peterson 1973). Recently, I have argued that Cholula was not abandoned and that the Great Pyramid continued as a ceremonial zone at least into the Early Postclassic period (McCafferty 1996). The first line of evi dence to support this reinterpretation comes from the ceremonial pre cinct on the south side of the Great Pyramid. A miniature pyramid altar with the unfortunate misnomer of "Altar Mexica"5 is associated with an early stage of the Patio of the Altars. It contained offerings that included Cocoyotla Black-on-natural (sometimes called "Az tec I") pottery diagnostic of the Epiclassic and Early Postclassic pe riods (Acosta 1970a; McCafferty 1997). A nearby stratigraphic test found that virtually all of the 6 m of deposition above the Mosaic Pa tio was Postclassic (Miiller 1970:132, Figure 22). Cocoyotla pot tery was also associated with Str. 1 (Matos Moctezuma and López V. 1967) and Altar 2 (Acosta 1970b). The implication is that the Pa tio of the Altars and other elements of the southern precinct (includ ing the Bebedores murals) span the Late Classic to Early Postclassic in a continuous sequence (McCafferty 1996).6 Cocoyotla Black-on-natural features black-painted decoration over the tannish-orange of the unslipped surface (Figure 10). De signs include horizontal straight or wavy lines on the interior wall. More complex subtypes can include a panel of black paint through which designs are incised. The typical vessel form is a subhemi 5 The "Altar Mexica" probably derives its name from having "Aztec I" ceramics among its offerings; in the Cholula archaeological zone the altar is identified with a descriptive text discussing the Mexica/Aztec culture. In fact, "Aztec I" (Cocoyotla Black-on-natural) ceramics are Epiclassic and Early Postclassic diagnostics, and therefore the Altar Mexica predates the Mexica culture by at least 300 years. 6 In his review of this paper, Joseph Mountjoy writes "The problem is the virtual absence of Metepec and Oxtoticpac material. There is a 300-year gap between the beginning of Metepec and Aztec I." I believe that the beginnings of what has been called "Aztec I" (i.e., Cocoyotla Black-on-natural) may be as early as a.d. 700, and therefore there is no gap. Nevertheless, this issue is far from resolved, and additional research must address the problem. 4 Claus Siebe (personal communication 1996) suggests that the Popo catepetl volcano went through a period of violent eruptions between a.d. 800 and 1000 that may have effected Cholula as well as its rural hinterland. To my knowledge no evidence of volcanic debris has been found at the site, but future excavation should address this possibility and also the effects of re sultant ash fall and mud slides on subsidiary population centers and agri cultural lands.</page><page sequence="12">310 McCafferty spherical bowl with a flattened bottom that was occasionally stamp impressed with a decorative pattern. Cocoyotla pottery resembles "Aztec 1" Black-on-orange pottery from the Valley of Mexico in both form and decoration, although it does not fit neatly into any of the categories defined by Hodge and Mine (1991).7 Since Str. 3 and 4 of the Patio of the Altars attach to the exterior of Stage 3A of the Great Pyramid (Salazar O. 1970), they postdate the "classic" talud-tablero facade. On the west side of the pyra mid, Stages 3B and 3C also postdate the talud-tablero architec ture, but are then covered over by yet another layer of adobe fill (Stage 4). Stage 4 was either never completed, or the stone and stucco surface was removed for later construction, perhaps for the Postclassic ceremonial center built by Tolteca-Chichimeca immi grants that included the "new" Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl (see be low). Further evidence for the abandonment of the Great Pyramid complex is found in the Patio of the Altars, where Altars 1 and 3 were shattered (Acosta 1970c; Contreras 1970), and in the case of Altar 3 the pieces were then dispersed. This may be evidence of violent conflict between rival ethnic factions, as illustrated on the nearby Cacaxtla murals (McVicker 1985), or of a "termination rit ual" intended to symbolically release the power of the ceremonial center (cf. Mock 1997). Epiclassic and Early Postclassic ceramics cover the surface of the Great Pyramid, where they are associated with buildings from the final construction stage (Noguera 1954:219-226). Pottery types include Cocoyotla Black-on-natural, San Pedro Polished Red, Oco tlán Red Rim, San Andrés Red, and even Torre Polychrome (Mc Cafferty 1997). On the basis of his ceramic sequence, Noguera (1954:226) inferred two distinct phases of occupation on the pyr amid: Cholulteca I that was characterized by Cocoyotla Black-on natural; and Cholulteca III, characterized by polícroma firme (Torre Polychrome) and stamped-bottom bowls. By reordering the ce ramic sequence (as discussed in the following section) this can be reinterpreted as a simple progression from Epiclassic to Early Post classic periods. Noguera's most extensive excavations were on the northeast plat form of the Great Pyramid at the Altar de los Cráneos Esculpidos (Altar of the Carved Skulls; Noguera 1937; 1954:225-226). The altar itself was a miniature, pyramid-shaped tomb, nearly identical to the "Altar Mexica" in the Patio of the Altars, but with plaster covered sculptures of human skulls attached to the exterior. Skel etons of an adult male and female were found within the altar, buried with an elaborate offering of pottery vessels, copper jew elry, obsidian projectile points, spinning and weaving tools, a bone musical rasp (omichicahuaztli), and the jaw bone of a dog (Nogu era 1937:9-10). The altar was located in a small patio surrounded by stairways leading up to platforms on at least two sides. The patio and altar were sealed beneath a later floor (Noguera 1954:226). Cocoyotla Black-on-natural pottery was found within the tomb and in the fill sealed by the upper floor. During the summer of 19941 had the opportunity to conduct ad ditional excavations at the patio surrounding the Altar of the Carved Skulls (McCafferty and Suárez C. 1995). Test pits on the south, east, and north sides of the patio identified six construction stages as the patio was modified and finally filled and sealed (Figure 11). Stage 1 featured an earlier pyramid-altar, similar to the one excavated by Noguera. Stage 2 represents an expansion of that altar and a portion of an associated stucco floor; an intrusive burial pit with the skel eton of a seated adolescent was discovered just north of the altar. The original altar was then partially dismantled on the south and west sides to accommodate the north staircase of the Patio of the Carved Skulls (Stage 3). On the west side of the patio this staircase was built in three successive stages. Interestingly, while the patio itself corresponds to the orientation of the Great Pyramid at 24° north of west, the Al tar of the Carved Skulls is oriented at 17° north of west, conforming with sites in the Valley of Mexico such as Teotihuacan and Tula (Tichy 1981). Finally, the altar and the rest of the patio were filled and then covered by a stucco floor (Stage 6). Material remains in the construction fill from the various stages of the Patio of the Carved Skulls complex are remarkably consis tent, despite substantial alterations to the architectural plan; this assemblage is the basis for defining the Early Tlachihualtepetl phase (a.d. 700-900). The two principal serving ware types were Coco yotla Black-on-natural and Tepontla Burnished Gray/brown (Table 4). These ranged in frequency between 23 and 31% for Co coyotla, and 26 and 32% for Tepontla; Cocoyotla became slightly more abundant through time, while Tepontla decreased slightly. Aco Table 4.

The co-occurrence of the Classic period diagnostic Tepontla Burnished with the Early Postclassic di agnostic Cocoyotla Black-on-natural suggests that the transition did not involve a major break in the cultural sequence. The lack of Teo tihuacan Thin Orange indicates that this is not simply redeposited fill, since in that case some Thin Orange would be expected. . Only a single polychrome rim sherd (Ocotlán subtype Sencillo) was found, though Noguera (1954:226) noted that it was present in other parts of the platform, and in fact surface reconnaissance of an adjacent but stratigraphically later area west of the patio did</page><page sequence="14">312 McCafferty discover polychrome ceramics. A single sherd of Mazapan Red on-buff was found at the patio (Cobean 1990:267-280), as were several sherds imported from the Gulf Coast. Five 14C samples were submitted for dating by the INAH lab, but because of the small size of the samples only one date has been returned. Charcoal recovered from above the stucco floor of Stage 2 was dated at a.d. 1266-1387 (681 ± 59 b.p.; INAH-1332). This date is far too late, since by a.d. 1000 polychrome pottery is well documented from Cholula (see dis cussion in the next section); the date may correspond to dis turbance related to the intrusive burial pit. Future testing at the site will hopefully produce additional materials suitable for dating. Another source for evaluating the Classic to Postclassic tran sition is the nearby site of Cerro Zapotecas, located about 2 km west of Cholula (Mountjoy 1987; Mountjoy and Peterson 1973). A broad natural terrace contains numerous small mounds and a ballcourt. Pottery included diagnostic types from the Late Clas sic through Epiclassic that can be tentatively identified as Tepontla Burnished Gray/brown with incised and stamped designs, and Comae Red-on-buff,8 possibly a precursor of Cocoyotla Black on-natural based on design similarities (Mountjoy 1987:142, Fig ure 4; Mountjoy and Peterson 1973:112-113, 136). Two 14C dates were obtained: Mound 3 was dated at a.d. 644-861 (1315 ± 100 b.p.; GX-2446); and the ballcourt (Mound 4) was dated at a.d. 543-937 (1345 ± 180 b.p.; GX-2447). An archaeomagnetic sam ple from Mound 2 dated to a.d. 785-820 (Wolfman 1990:280 281). The Early Tlachihualtepetl ceramic assemblage at the Patio of the Carved Skulls combined Classic and Early Postclassic diag nostic types, suggesting a gradual transition with the addition of new elements (e.g., Cocoyotla Black-on-natural and Momoxpan Metallic Orange). That there was not a dramatic disruption in the material culture argues against the concept of a major break in the cultural sequence, such as would be caused by site abandonment or invasion by a foreign ethnic group. Furthermore, no evidence has been discovered to indicate either volcanic eruptions or flood ing. An alternative model for the Classic to Postclassic transition might therefore be one of gradual intermarriage with a group of newcomers, possibly from the Gulf Coast based on ceramics and architectural elements from the Great Pyramid (McCafferty 1996). It should be noted that this does not conform to the ethnohistoric model of Olmeca-Xicallanca conquerors driving out the quinametin ("giants") as recorded by Ixtlilxochitl (1975-1977 [1625]:529 530). Nor does it agree with the image of ethnic conflict depicted in the Cacaxtla battle murals (McCafferty and McCafferty 1994; McVicker 1985; Quirarte 1983), and implied by the destruction of monuments in the Patio of the Altars. The Classic to Postclassic transition remains the most problem atic period in Cholula's culture history, in part because the ethno historic accounts do not correspond well with the archaeological evidence. The recent investigations at the Patio of the Carved Skulls have contributed important information to the question, but addi tional work is urgently needed to expose both earlier and later stages of the construction sequence, and to obtain datable material with which to calibrate the ceramic sequence. Postclassic Period Postclassic Cholula was a major religious center for central Mex ico, compared in Colonial-period accounts to Mecca or Rome (Ro jas 1927 [1581]; Sahagún 1950-1982 [1547-1585], Introductory Volume:70). It covered an area of about 8 km2, with a population estimated at 38,000-50,000 (Peterson 1987; Sanders 1971:29 31). Early Colonial accounts describe "more than 430 towers . .. all of temples" (Cortés 1986 [1519—1521]:75) in the city at the time of the Conquest; local residents still remember leveling mounds for agricultural fields. The ceremonial center of the city in the Late Postclassic was the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl, located beneath what is today the Cathedral of San Gabriel on the plaza of San Pedro Cholula (Olivera 1970).9 Pilgrims from throughout Mesoamerica visited Cholula to attend religious ceremonies, and foreign nobles kept estates in Cholula where they stayed when they visited the Temple of Quetzalcoatl to receive legitimation (Rojas 1927 [1581]). The Great Pyramid was partially abandoned by the Late Postclas sic but was still an important shrine for a rain deity, Chiconauqui ahuitl (Rojas 1927 [1581]), possibly a female avatar of the Aztec goddess Chalchiuhtlicue (McCafferty 1996). The discovery of hun dreds of Late Postclassic burials from the Great Pyramid's ceremo nial precinct indicates that it was still considered a locus of ritual activity (López et al. 1976). Cholula was a center for artisans, and pochteca merchants af filiated with the Quetzalcoatl/Yacatecuhtli cult brought exotic goods to the Cholula marketplace (Durán 1971 [1576—1579]: 129, 278; Pineda 1970 [1593]). It was particularly famous for its beautiful polychrome pottery that was considered a hallmark of the Mixteca Puebla stylistic tradition (Lind 1994; McCafferty 1994; Nichol son 1960, 1982; Noguera 1954; Suárez C. 1994). Cholula polychrome was the preferred tableware of the Aztec king (Diaz del Castillo 1963 [1580]:226). Yet despite scholarly recognition of its artistic quality, the evolution of Cholula polychrome has remained poorly understood. The confusion stems from Müller's assignment of all polychrome types to her Cholulteca III phase, after a.d. 1325. Since polychrome pottery was well developed in other central Mexico sites well before this date, Müller effec , tively eliminated Cholula from having contributed to the devel opment of the artistic style for which it was most famous (but see McCafferty 1994, 1997). Recent excavations and analyses of Postclassic contexts con tribute to a reinterpretation of the Postclassic sequence, and thereby push back the date for the origins of Cholula polychrome to at least a.d. 900.The earliest absolute dates come from a pre-Hispanic well excavated in downtown San Pedro Cholula by Sergio Suárez C. (1994). The well was filled with domestic refuse; judging from mends from widely separated levels it was probably filled over a fairly brief period of time. Two 14C samples produced dates of a.d. 897-1018 (1065 ± 55 b.p.; INAH-1102) and a.d. 905-1220 (960 ± 140 b.p.; INAH-1103). Ceramics found in the well in cluded Cocoyotla Black-on-natural. Xicalli Plain, and Ocotlán Red Rim, including the polychrome subtypes Cristina Matte and Ele gante. Diagnostic Postclassic utilitarian types such as Momoxpan Orange and San Andrés Red were well represented in the assem blage. 8 Joseph Mountjoy provided valuable unpublished information on dec orative elements of ceramics from Cerro Zapotecas. 9 Archaeological investigations in 1993 and 1994 by the Universidad de las Américas searched for traces of the ceremonial complex beneath the convent associated with the cathedral.</page><page sequence="15">Ceramics and chronology of Cholula 313 A Postclassic trash deposit excavated on the UDLA campus was dated at a.d. 1260-1392 (700 ± 95 b.p.; GX-1815; Mountjoy and Peterson 1973:30). It contained a diverse assemblage of polychrome types (Mountjoy and Peterson 1973:33), including "Cholula Poly chrome A" (Apolo Red-and-black-on-orange Polychrome, Aqui ahuac Burnt Orange Polychrome, and Coapan Laca Polychrome; 22%), "Cholula Polychrome B" (Aquiahuac subtype Barracuda; 14%), and "Cholula Polychrome D" (Torre Polychrome; 6%). Late Postclassic ceramics were found at the UA-79 excavations from the UDLA campus, particularly in the F-10 trash midden (Bar rientos 1980; Lind 1979, 1994). Apolo-Red-and-black-on-orange Polychrome (33%) was the most abundant decorated type found, but Aquiahuac subtype Zócalo (4%), Torre Polychrome (4%), and Coapan Laca (3%) were also present. A pre-Hispanic well from the UDLA campus with a similar ceramic assemblage was 14C dated at a.d. 1333-1448 (500 ± 80 b.p.; 1-14, -614; Uruñuela and Alvarez Méndez 1989:70, in Lind 1994:81, Note 4).

Additional Postclassic deposits have been found in rescate ex cavations throughout Cholula. A Late Tlachihualtepetl phase mid den was found at the R-106 Transito site (McCafferty and Suárez C. 1994), with Torre Polychrome (9%), Cuaxiloa Matte (7%), Co coyotla Black-on-natural (5%), and Aquiahuac Black-on-orange (4%). Suárez C.

On the other hand, there are still relatively few analyzed con texts with which to test this sequence, and even fewer chronometric dates with which to calibrate the periods. CONCLUSIONS yn aia qujmomachitia in tlalli, in tapalcatl cololoa [they are those who know nothing, those who pile up earth (and) potsherds [Sahagún 1950-1982 (1547-1585):Bk. 6:2] In contrast to Sahagun's pessimistic characterization, archaeolo gists learn about the past precisely by "piling earth and pot sherds." Over the past 100 years, archaeologists studying Cholula have generated huge mounds of both, and consequently a culture history spanning 2,500 years can now be reconstructed, even if it is still very tentative. Confusion over Cholula's chronological sequence has hin dered the ability to address fundamental questions about its his tory and the processes of historical change, especially in relation to the Epiclassic transition and the origins of the Mixteca-Puebla polychrome ceramic tradition. Investigations over the past 25 years contribute to a «interpretation of the sequences proposed by Nogu era (1954) and Miiller (1970, 1978). The revised chronology is informed by absolute dates, but also by excavated ceramic assem blages from primary depositional contexts. Consequently, a se quence of ceramic complexes is constructed that is calibrated using 14C and other archaeometric dating techniques (Figure 17). Note, however, that although the number of 14C dates has in creased dramatically in recent years, most phases are still repre sented by only a single date, and no phase has more than one dated assemblage, so independent confirmation is as yet impossible. Only a single chronometric date exists from the ceremonial precinct of the Great Pyramid, and it is questionable. More dated contexts are</page><page sequence="18">316 McCafferty Figure 14.

As stated at the outset, a good chronology is one that can ac curately and unambiguously order material culture through time. However, while this is an ideal representing normative, unilineal change, it does not reflect cultural practice, where objects are used purposi vely to symbolize a variety of specific, multidimensional strat egies.

This level of analysis is not possible with out finely tuned chronological control, but it is always important to keep in mind that the construction of a diachronic sequence is not the end of the analysis.

Cholula has had a long and complex history, and therefore offers tremendous potential for addressing a wide range of substantive and theoretical research questions. Past confusion over site chronology has severely limited interpretation, while discour aging attempts to incorporate Cholula in broader syntheses of Me soamerican culture history. The chronological sequence presented herein is intended to provide a framework for future investiga tions. Significant gaps still exist, and further refinement is needed for all periods; nevertheless, important discoveries have been made in the reconstruction of Cholula's historical development. Hope fully we can now move beyond chronology to address more problem-oriented research questions that will allow Cholula to contribute meaningfully to the broader debates in Mesoamerican archaeology.</page><page sequence="21">Ceramics and chronology of Cholula 319 1000 B.C. 500 Cholula Cream Totimehuacan Red/brown Amalucan Polished Black Coapa Orange Tepontla Burnished Gray Acozoc Tan/orange Teotihuacan Thin Orange Cocoyotla Black/natural Ocotlan Red Rim Xicalli Plain Cerro Zapotecas Sandy Plain Momoxpan Metallic Orange San Andres Red San Pedro Polished Red Cuaxiloa Matte Polychrome Torre Polychrome Aquiahuac Black-on-orange Apolo Red-t-black-on-orange Coapsn Laca Polychrome 500 1000 A.D. 1500 II M M I I I I I I I I I I I I iiiiiiii mum iiiiiiii TTT TV I I I I II I I I I I I I I I I I 1000 B.C. 500 500 1000 A.D. 1500 Figure 17. Diachronic distribution of ceramic types. RESUMEN Cholula fue un centro urbano y religioso por lo menos 2,500 años. Este ensayo documenta la cronología del sitio arqueológico durante su historia prehispánica, usando la secuencia de cerámica calibrada con fechas abso lutas de radiocarbon y arqueomagnetismo. Resultados de esta síntesis in dican que Cholula fue ocupada continuamente desde el preclásico medio, aunque hubieron varios cambios culturales y étnicos. Esta conclusión con trasta con interpretaciones recientes, especialmente las del Proyecto Cho lula, pero están más de acuerdo con interpretaciones basadas en fuentes ethnohistóricas. Las diferencias entre las dos interpretaciones pueden ser explicadas por avances metodológicos: un énfasis en excavaciones con textúales y en el uso de métodos de datación absolutos. Investigaciones arqueológicas en Cholula fueron conducidas por más de 100 años. La mayoría de estas excavaciones se concentró en la zona ceremonial alrededor de la Gran Pirámide, con muy poca atención a la zona urbana. La compleja estratigrafía de la Gran Pirámide hace difícil interpretar la secuencia de construcción, y como consecuencia la cronología ha estado sujeta a varias interpretaciones. Especificamente, la transición entre el clásico y el postclásico ha sido interpretada como un abandono del sitio así como una ocupación continua. Con nuevos datos de excavaciones recientes y reinterpretaciones de evidencia anterior, podemos empezar a apreciar la historia completa de Cholula. Los restos más tempranos de Cholula ocurre alrededor dé una antigua laguna al noreste de la Gran Pirámide, cerca de los terrenos de la Universidad de las Américas (UDLA). Cerámica típica del preclásico me dio se ha encontrado en varios lugares, incluyendo basureros de San An drés Cholula, el Hotel Villas Arqueológicas, y UA-69 y UA-70 de la UDLA.</page><page sequence="22">320 McCafferty Una muestra de 14C dio una fecha de 897-765 a.C. Es durante el pre clásico que las etapas más tempranas de la zona ceremonial fueron con struidas, y la zona urbana de Cholula creció a 2 km2. La Cholula del período clásico se conoce mejor por los niveles 1-3 de la Gran Pirámide, cuando varios rasgos (incluyendo la cerámica) se ase mejan a Teotihuacan. Excavaciones recientes de un conjunto doméstico, denominado R-106, produjo cuatro fechas de carbón entre 400 y 650 d.C. con un complejo de cerámica que define el clásico tardío. Otras excava ciones recientes han descubierto restos clásicos en la falda de la Gran Pirámide y en el Hotel Villas Arqueológicas. La época más problemática en Cholula todavia es el epiclásico, entre 700 y 1000 d.C. Distintas interpretaciones sugieren tanto el abandono del sitio como ocupación continua. Evidencia en el cercano Cerro Zapotecas indica otra ocupación, posiblemente de refugios, con numerosos montícu los y una cancha de juego de pelota. Sin embargo, nuevas excavaciones en el Patio de los Cráneos Esculpidos, donde Noguera excavó en los años 30, produjeron un complejo de cerámica que combina rasgos del clásico y post clásico temprano, indicando un transición gradual. En base a esta eviden cia, parece que Cholula no fue abandonada, aunque sí hubo un transición con introducción de rasgos nuevos, probablemente indicativa de una en trada de gente del grupo étnico olmeca-xicalanca. Durante el epiclásico, la Gran Pirámide fue ampliada a su máxima extensión, con rasgos estilísticos del Golfo. En el postclásico Cholula llegó a su tamaño máximo, con una po blación de 38,000-50,000 en una área de aproximadamente 8 km2. En esta época Cholula fue centro religioso del culto de Quetzalcoatl; mercadores pochteca de Cholula viajaron por todas partes de Mesoamérica intercam biando bienes exóticos por artículos del estilo "mixteca-puebla." La cerámica polícroma estilo mixteca-puebla está presente en Cholula desde por lo menos 900 d.C. Las excavaciones del sitio UA-1 que documentan la secuencia evolutiva de la cerámica polícroma, la cual se divide en cuatro fases. Durante el postclásico, el centro ceremonial de Cholula cambió al presente zócalo de San Pedro Cholula, en donde se asentó la Pirámide de Quetzalcoatl descrita por los conquistadores españoles. La Gran Pirámide permaneció en uso como sanctuario; los terrenos del recinto sagrado con tuvieron más de 400 entierros postclásicos. Con 13 fechas absolutas ya es posible construir una secuencia crono lógica para Cholula. De todos modos, es muy poco considerado la larga du ración del centro arqueológico. Las interpretaciones presentadas aquí se consideran como hipótesis simplemente; esperamos nuevos datos para eval uar y ampliar estas sugerencias. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS My research on the ceramics and chronology of Cholula has been sup ported by Sigma Xi, a SUNY-Binghamton Research grant, and a Mellon Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Brown University. Many individ uals have contributed to this research, notably Chuck Caskey, Michael Lind, and Sergio Suárez C, Sergio's ongoing commitment to Cholula archaeol ogy continues to produce important results, including most of the 14C dates reported here. Sharisse McCafferty provided enormous assistance in all phases of this analysis, including drafting the maps and drawing ceramics; the Bebedores of Figure 9 were drawn by Sharisse with the assistance of Kalleen Chilcote, and Figure 4 was drawn by R. Ashley Withers. This pa per has benefited from the thoughtful comments of Elizabeth Brumfiel, Michael Lind, Joseph Mountjoy, and Mike Smith. Mickey Lind's knowl edge of Cholula archaeology and his role of devil's advocate have been particularly helpful in preparing this study. REFERENCES Acosta, Jorge R. 1970a Sección 3.
