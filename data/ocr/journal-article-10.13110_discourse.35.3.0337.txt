<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Uncommon Sense: Dictatorship,  Transition, and Dissensus in Carmen  Martín Gaite’s El cuarto de atrás José Luis Venegas In Carmen Martín Gaite’s study of courtship customs in post– civil war Spain, Usos amorosos de la posguerra española (1987), the  renowned Spanish novelist discusses how feminine magazines in  postwar Spain instructed women to use their romantic correspon- dence to inquire about topics of interest to their male addressees  and to lay the foundations for a strong and durable marriage.1  Knowing the rhetorical tricks for attracting male attention was  indeed a valuable asset in achieving the ultimate goal for females  who grew up and became adults during General Francisco Franco’s  dictatorship (1939–75): finding a husband. While writing letters  was considered a skill that, like sewing, cooking, and ironing, every  woman in search of a husband should master, it also had the curi- ous power of suspending the benumbing rules that cast women in  the invariable roles of obedient daughter, dutiful wife, and dedi- cated mother. Talking about one’s feelings in a letter, Martín Gaite  writes, was like putting down a “draft version” of the novel in which  these young women sought to play the leading part that was unre- mittingly denied to them by their dreary circumstances.2 The narrative creativity of these private missives closely resem- bles Martín Gaite’s model of literary writing.

ISSN 1522-5321. </page> <page sequence="2"> 338 José Luis Venegas acabar (1983), a collection of essays on the craft of fiction, she  explains that one of the earliest manifestations of a writer’s “narra- tive autonomy,” of her capacity to use language freely, is the letter  she sends to a “flesh-and-blood friend.” She contrasts this liberating  form of writing with the dry and impersonal rhetorical exercises  designed to teach unwilling schoolchildren how to write proper  letters. The personal missive, unlike the academic composition,  frees the powers of the imagination from what she describes as the  “rusty rails” of set formulas and official values.3 Although Martín  Gaite never wrote a conventional epistolary novel, her works often  feature letters as emblems of freedom and liberation from soci- ety’s constraints. El cuarto de atrás (1978) is perhaps the novel that  best illustrates this link between epistolary writing and social criti- cism.4 The letters in the novel appear as fragments of the female  protagonist’s psyche, as manifestations of those ideas, dreams, and  desires that had to remain secret during Franco’s dictatorship. As  Patrick Paul Garlinger has perceptively noted, the letters in the text  function “as signposts of foreclosed desire, of libidinal activity that  has been buried and ostensibly forgotten.”5 Specifically, Garlinger  focuses on how some of the letters exchanged between female  characters articulate the specter of lesbian desire and break with  the patriarchal and heterosexual expectations that have tradition- ally governed the epistolary genre. While letter writing certainly  conveys the female narrator’s innovative representations of gender  and sexuality, as Garlinger has amply demonstrated, it also allows  us to consider Martín Gaite’s work as an attempt to expose not  only the repressive ideology of the Franco years but also the official  rhetoric of the historical period that followed those years and coin- cided with the process of composition of the novel: the transition  to democracy.6 In telescoping its criticism of these two periods, El  cuarto de atrás encourages an understanding of the Spanish transi- tion not as a new beginning for the country but as the continuation  of past repression under new political and social forms. Political analysts have often considered the Spanish transition  as an exemplary model of democratization through consensual  arbitration.7 Consensus, an almost sacred notion during this time,  became a matter of common sense, an unquestioned principle  that brought together political elites of widely different ideologi- cal stripes in their efforts to leave behind a turbulent and divisive  historical past and to build a democratic future. El cuarto de atrás  asks us to read the social text of the transition and the consensual  strategies that otherwise buttressed it by eschewing blind celebra- tory narratives and disarticulating the received notions and com- monsensical certitudes on which the “success” of the transition  </page> <page sequence="3"> Uncommon Sense 339 rests. In doing so, Martín Gaite’s work shakes loose the symbolic  structure of a specific political and historical process and, more  generally, the type of consensual negotiation of which that process  has become the model. The letters that circulate in the novel carry  out this dismantling task in a pervasive manner while at the same  time replenishing forms of discourse that the transition’s consenso  tended to render illegible. “Epistolarity,” according to Janet Altman’s definition, is “the  use of the letter’s formal properties to create meaning.” “Episto- larity” and “meaning,” Altman points out, “must remain partially  vacant terms,” since their specific value depends on the mul- titude of contextual and formal factors that “make novels such  complex artifacts.”8 In El cuarto de atrás, the meaning of the term  “epistolarity” becomes apparent within and against what power,  whether dictatorial or democratic, constructs as common sense.  Martín Gaite’s use of fictional letters in her novel possesses politi- cal meaning not because it conveys the author’s engagement with  particular ideologies but because it involves what Jacques Ran- cière calls a “partition of the sensible and the sayable” that breaks  with what the language of power constructs as the self-evident,  natural order of things. Following Rancière’s thesis that the poli- tics of literature “is not the politics of its writers,”9 I contend that  El cuarto de atrás is political insofar as it proposes a reconfiguration  of the common world that supplements the forms of perception  and the distribution of social identities carried out by institutional  authority. According to Rancière, forms of political domination  often rely on an “aesthetic of consensus” that aims at eradicat- ing heterogeneity by recalling “the obviousness of what there is.”10  This obviousness can only be disrupted by the kind of “dissensual  activity” that questions not only the content of established politi- cal options but also their “aesthetics,” the forms of perception  and expression that separate audible and sayable statements from  mere noise. Dissensus is a moment of interruption that disrupts  our received wisdoms and sense-making practices. If dissensus is  a radically political moment for Rancière, it is not because dis- sensus designates a form of disagreement enunciated from an  already established ideological position within a given political  system; rather, dissensus is political because it points to what does  not fit within that system, to forms of heterogeneity that cannot  be assimilated to preexisting social, cultural, and political grids.  Politics, in Rancière’s understanding of the term, is an aesthetic  phenomenon: “politics is aesthetic in that it makes visible what  had been excluded from the perceptual field, and in that it makes  audible what used to be inaudible.”11 This visibility and audibility  </page> <page sequence="4"> 340 José Luis Venegas are not, however, moments of recognition whereby what was previ- ously hidden or unknown is given meaning by established forms  of perception, organization, and classification (what Rancière  calls the “police”).12 Instead, dissensual acts break with the per- ceptual configurations and modes of circulation that assign politi- cal subject positions. As opposed to consensus and other forms of  elite settlement, these intermittent acts of dissensus that punctu- ate a given perceptual field are the condition of possibility for the  kind of radical democracy that never forecloses new political rela- tions and subjectivities. Dissensus is therefore a suitable notion to  unearth the heretofore unacknowledged political valence of a key  literary text that actively problematizes the challenges and pitfalls  of a process of postdictatorial democratization deeply rooted in  consensual strategies. As a form of dissensus, epistolarity in El cuarto de atrás articu- lates ways of enunciation that break with the closures imposed by  what the dictatorship and the Spanish transition construct as the  self-evident “sense of the common,” which establishes the politi- cal and social limits of the possible, the visible, and the sayable.13  Although the ostensive target of epistolary dissensus in the novel  is the patriotic and patriarchal myths that upheld Franco’s regime,  the letter form in El cuarto de atrás also exposes the rhetorical  manipulations behind what the transition presented as self-evident  truths. Epistolarity emerges in El cuarto de atrás as a flexible and  multifaceted dissensual activity, one that effectively erodes both the  myths of Francoism and the commonsensical fallacies of the transi- tion by articulating alternative “partitions of the sensible and the  sayable.”14 Written during the early years of the Spanish transition,  between November 1975 and April 1978, El cuarto de atrás revolves  around a long conversation between C., a woman writer who  closely resembles Martín Gaite, and a mysterious visitor dressed in  black who arrives unexpectedly in her apartment in the middle of  a stormy night. This conversation allows C. to reminisce about her  childhood and adolescence, a time when the “back room” of the  novel’s title was not only a physical space (it was originally both a  playroom and a classroom in the parental household in Salamanca  that later became a storage room for food after the war) but was  also a mental realm where she could take refuge from society’s  norms and pressures. As she explores her back room during her  interview with the man in black, C. makes frequent references to  love letters she wrote during those years. Those letters are often  presented as instruments of subversion, as written documents that  actively break with the demands of a squalid and uninviting reality. </page> <page sequence="5"> Uncommon Sense 341 As written manifestations of C.’s back room—of her imagined  identities and even forbidden sexual desires—the letters that punc- tuate her recollection of the past function as a form of symbolic  dissidence against Franco’s conservative propaganda. Specifically,  they deviate from established notions of female development and  undermine the single-voiced patriotism of the dictatorship. The  love letters that young C. writes and receives continue a long tradi- tion of transgressive epistolary writing in Western literature that  harks back to Ovid’s Heroides. Like the amorous epistles written by  Ovid’s fifteen heroines or like those found in The Letters from a Por- tuguese Nun (1669)—which Martín Gaite edited and translated into  Spanish in a volume titled Cartas de amor de la monja portuguesa Mari- ana Alcoforado, published posthumously in 2000—C.’s missives are,  according to Linda Kauffman, simultaneously “love letters” and “a  legal challenge, a revolt staged in writing.”15 As Kauffman indicates,  the revolutionary valence of this type of epistolary writing lies in  its capacity to disrupt the laws of gender that channel desire and  the laws of genre that determine how to express that desire. His- torically, the epistolary genre has participated in the domestication  of female desire by circumscribing it within a patriarchal symbolic  economy. As Shari Bernstock argues, conventional epistolary nov- els penned by male authors cast “a grammar of sexuality” by invent- ing “fatal plots in which the heroine succumbed to marriage, died  of shame, was forced to deny her sexuality.”16 Despite this connec- tion between fictional letters and the laws of patriarchy, Kauffman  contends that the letter form has the capacity to disrupt the inter- locking legislations of gender and genre—what Derrida calls la loi  du genre (“genres are not to be mixed”). This law “is not a formal  one,” for “it covers the motif of the law in general, of generation  in the natural and symbolic senses, of birth in the natural and sym- bolic senses, of the generation of difference.”17 Derrida’s The Post Card examines the letter as an “impure” form  that ultimately fails to sustain differences such as those that suppos- edly exist between self and other, fiction and history, and male and  female. “Mixture,” writes Derrida, “is the letter, the epistle, which  is not a genre [i.e., genre but also gender: the product of ‘gen- eration’ or ‘partition’], but all genres, literature itself.”18 The Post  Card addresses these textual and epistemological indeterminacies  in a series of love letters, sent or unsent, that Derrida writes to an  unnamed lover who may be an actual person or a figment of the  writer’s imagination. In one of the letters, he tells about a postcard  that he purchased in a gift shop next to the Bodleian Library in  Oxford. The postcard shows Socrates sitting at a desk taking dicta- tion from Plato. The postcard’s naming mistake elicits Derrida’s  </page> <page sequence="6"> 342 José Luis Venegas reflections on postal exchange and his deconstructive denial of the  possibility of conveying meaning successfully. Misnomers, like mis- communications and failed postal deliveries, evoke language’s fal- libility, caused by its incapacity to sink its roots into a stable source  of meaning. According to Derrida’s postal principle, meaning is  nowhere fully present in the structures of language. Rather, it is  always already dispersed, always already caught up in a sequence  of relays without a recognizable origin or final destination. Letters  do no always reach their destination, and if they do, it is because  there is always the possibility that they might not. “A letter,” Der- rida writes, “does not always arrive at its destination, and as soon as  that belongs to its structure, it can be said that it never truly arrives  there, that when it arrives its could-not-arrive torments it with an  internal drift.”19 If writing is like a postal network, then it is always a  repetitive activity riddled with glitches and discontinuities that dis- rupt the very possibility of systematic communication and the mak- ing and exchange of stable meaning and sense. The dissemination  of letters, like the dissemination of linguistic utterances, “threatens  the law of the signifier . . . as the contract of truth. It broaches,  breaches the unity of the signifier, that is, of the phallus.”20 Letter  writing and the postal system are modes of articulation and circula- tion that upset the possibility of predictable meaning and destabi- lize systems of classification (of genres and genders) based on fixed  positions and binary alternatives. In a similar fashion, C.’s love letters defy the symbolic order  that prevailed in Francoist Spain. One of the most memorable  episodes in Martín Gaite’s novel, a recasting of her first published  story, El balneario (1955), revolves around a “wild farewell letter”  that the protagonist writes to an attractive young man whom she  had met at a spa where she was spending a few days with her father.  As a document that no “decent and decorous young lady” could  have had the audacity to write at that time, this note clashes against  the stilted rigidity of the other guests at the spa, “conventional  people” who act as if they were actors closely following a script.21  This defiant attitude against scripted norms is also perceived in the  letters that C. receives from a Portuguese student whom she met  while studying abroad in Coimbra. Although it is never indicated  that C. ever wrote letters back to her Portuguese suitor (perhaps  maintaining decorum in this instance), his correspondence breaks  with courtship customs in postwar Spain. His missives remain “on  a very poetical plane”22 and never deal with “agriculture,” “cattle,”  or “the prospect of floods.”23 These epistolary writings were not  intended as a prelude to a wedding either, since the young man  wrote for years but never went to C.’s hometown in Salamanca  </page> <page sequence="7"> Uncommon Sense 343 to see her.24 Furthermore, these letters oppose the authoritarian  notion of a true Spain as an uncontaminated space devoid of for- eign influences. In an effort to return the country to its “real” roots,  during the postwar period Franco and his government stressed the  importance of preserving Spanish authenticity with xenophobic  exclamations such as “let our friends, our servants, and our girl- friends be Spaniards. Don’t let customs other than ours live in the  blessed land of Spain.”25 The letters from the young man from Por- tugal, a country that despite its geographic proximity to Spain is  described in the novel as being “very far away,”26 pose a subtle chal- lenge to this essentialist homogeneity. In its “bid to stabilize itself and to effect the social institution- alization of victory,” Helen Graham observes, “the Franco regime  targeted women because of the pivotal role they played within the  family. The patriarchal family was seen as representing the corpo- rate order of the state in microcosm.”27 According to this analogy  between the family and the state, widely publicized through educa- tion, the press, and the media, the generalissimo ruled the country  like an authoritative yet caring father who controlled but also pro- tected the members of his household. This identification between  the political and the familial provided official propaganda with the  unchanging shape of myth. In Roland Barthes’s words, the main  characteristic of myth is to organize a world without contradictions  where meaning is “transformed into form”—a world, that is, where  “reality” is not a category open to interpretation.28 This unchang- ing form precludes all sorts of dissidence and establishes an organic  wholeness without fissures, a totalizing universe where historical  contingencies receive “a natural justification” (such as the biologi- cal “generation” associated with the family).29 Gender codes are  inextricably interwoven with the rhetoric of public discourse in  postwar Spain, since they naturalized the regime’s authoritarian  politics and social conservatism. C.’s epistolary activity, whether passive (as recipient of inappro- priate letters) or active (as writer), violates this political ideology  and its codes of proper conduct. The narrator never reveals the  actual contents of the letters she writes, as if what mattered was not  so much what the letters said as how they said it. When contrasted  with the rigid and motionless rhetoric of Francoist discourse, the  “altogether literary” elements of the note that C. writes at the spa  are as transgressive as the daring yet undisclosed contents of the  text. “The person to whom it was addressed mattered not at all,”  she indicates, for when she was penning the letter she was caught  “in a transport of narcissism.”30 Likewise, what defines the missives  from the Portuguese boy is not the sincerity or authenticity of its  </page> <page sequence="8"> 344 José Luis Venegas contents but their formal virtuosity: “That young man wrote very  well,” C. tells her interviewer.31 By stressing their status as verbal  constructs, as narcissistic forms of writing, these letters oppose the  self-effacing nature of official discourse with the self-assertion of  their own writing by revealing their “own determinants at the level  of form.”32 As metafictional documents, the letters exemplify what  David Herzberger perceptively identifies as one of the most cen- tral features of El cuarto de atrás: the reversal of the single-voiced  protocols of conservative history writing through the unmasking  of “the contingencies of narration” as a form of expression and  “as a way of knowing the past.”33 This questioning of conservative  mythologies is further developed by C.’s habit of writing and send- ing apocryphal letters to herself.34 Instead of serving as a method to  preserve, petrify, and naturalize static conceptions of identity and  history, prose narrative in these self-addressed letters becomes a  way of dissociating language from absolute essences. The multiple  names and identities that, we must assume, proliferate in this apoc- ryphal correspondence break with the mythical oneness of official  discourse, with that benumbing kind of propaganda that, “like a  malaise producing immobility,” establishes unchanging categories  and freezes reality into a static image of itself.35 Although C.’s metaliterary letters put into question the nor- mative truths proclaimed from the pulpits, through the radio  waves, and in newspapers and history books, that form of criticism  remains a private affair confined to the realm of the imagination— a gesture of defiance that opposes but does not alter dominant  notions of reality. The scene of failed postal delivery that closes the  episode at the spa offers a potent image of the gulf that separates  public discourse and private expressions of nonconformity in Fran- coist Spain. When C. musters the courage to deliver her passionate  message, the romantic smoke screen surrounding her addressee  brutally dissolves. Instead of engaging in romantic conversation, he  tells her about a failed plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and quickly  turns his attention to a group of older men discussing the shock- ing news. Estranged from their conversation, C. remains silent  and eventually returns to her room, where she tears her letter to  pieces. The rebellious world of prohibited romantic dreams is thus  crushed under the weight of history, which young C. perceives as an  alienating force, both distant and unreal, from which one can only  escape through the power of the imagination. “I scorned history,”  she writes, “and furthermore I didn’t believe it, I didn’t believe a  word of what was recounted in history books or in newspapers.”36  She places in opposition to these stories those contained in her  epistolary documents (here emblematized by the farewell note),  </page> <page sequence="9"> Uncommon Sense 345 which create a refuge from but not a visible challenge to present  historical conditions. The implication here is that nonconformist  attitudes in postwar Spain could only manifest themselves as purely  imaginative acts severed from historical actuality. With the end of the dictatorship, the opposition between the  world of history and the world of fantasy evoked in this passage  disappears. As she composed El cuarto de atrás, Martín Gaite wit- nessed the birth of a new society where dissidence did not have  to remain confined within the “back room” any longer. With the  recovery of democratic freedoms in Spain, the metaphorical cuarto  de atrás in Martín Gaite’s novel came to symbolize a “linguistic mau- soleum,” to use Teresa Vilarós’s apposite image.37 The back room is  no longer an “outside” or external point of resistance in a society  that celebrates “the end of utopias, the final defeat of criticism,  the joys of cynicism and the fragmentation of the real, along with  the aesthetic signs of a brand-new hedonism disseminated by the  media.”38 Despite this widespread celebratory mode, Martín Gaite  remained a critical and uncompromising voice in post-1975 Spain,  refusing to wholeheartedly embrace the stultifying cultural and  political products of the transition.39 Although she rarely made  overt political or ideological comments in her writings—perhaps  thinking, like French novelist Marie-Henri Beyle, who wrote under  the pen name Stendhal, that politics can be as disruptive in a novel  as a gunshot at a music concert—she fervently opposed the aesthet- ics of power during the Spanish transition, the time when she was  composing El cuarto de atrás. Central to this historical process was the notion of consensus,  which the political elites idealized as a means of weaving a new  postauthoritarian order after the death of the dictator and of carry- ing out a peaceful redemocratization of the country. The formula  of politics as consensus was a powerful instrument to “avoid rup- tures” and to “dismantle the Francoist regime from within, using  its legal and parliamentary structure against itself.”40 These politi- cal options (consensual agreement between Left and Right, transi- tion as reform rather than rupture) were presented to the public  as a matter of common sense, a concept that, as Antonio Gramsci  argues, can be used as an instrument to legitimize and naturalize  political power in a pervasive manner. Like religious beliefs, com- mon sense relates to a “conception of the world” that is accepted  as natural and unquestionable.41 Significantly, “common sense”  became a frequent buzzword in the televised speeches given dur- ing this transitional period by Adolfo Suárez, the last Francoist  prime minister and the main architect of the transition. As a for- mer director of the state television network, Suárez was well aware  </page> <page sequence="10"> 346 José Luis Venegas of the powers of mass media to manufacture public consent and  used them to present the reform as a matter of peaceful consen- sus between the people, the political parties, and the government  around what common sense dictates. On December 14, 1976, when  Martín Gaite was drafting chapters of her new novel, El cuarto de  atrás, Suárez finished a public address to the nation (televised the  night before the celebration of the referendum for a law of politi- cal reform that would bring democracy to the country without vio- lating or overthrowing Francoist legal legitimacy) by saying that  the goal of his administration would be to “open a door to the rule  of common sense.”42 Two days later after a staggering 94.2 percent  of the votes endorsed the bill, he appeared in front of the cam- eras again to triumphantly announce the victory of common sense,  which he equated with the victory of Spain as a whole: “I think that  common sense has won and that Spain has won.”43 The principles of common sense, which became shorthand for  the transition understood as reform rather than rupture, persisted  after Suárez’s term as president ended and the Spanish Social- ist Workers’ Party won the 1982 general elections. “Del sentido  común,” an opinion article published in October 1982 in the con- servative newspaper ABC, assured concerned readers that the new  left-wing government was not going to be a hazard to the political  path outlined by the previous administration. Thanks to the “com- mon sense of the Spaniards”—a common sense that, according to  the author (the journalist Carlos Luis Álvarez, writing under the  pseudonym “Cándido”) has been nurtured by the forty-year dicta- torship—they can now vote for a “nonrevolutionary Socialist Party”  that will not jeopardize the political and legislative framework  crafted by the political elite of the dictatorship. Common sense,  which is described in the article as something more “existential”  than “ideological,” is almost a euphemism or even a naturalizing  metaphor for politics understood as a transformation of (though  not a break with) the dictatorial regime.44 This sacralization of consensus and reform as the manifesta- tion of common sense weaves a totalizing story that occludes any  kind of discrepancy and criticism and consolidates a homogeneous  society “without blotches or fissures.”45 Vilarós identifies a counter- narrative that proliferates on the underside of official discourse, a  narrative that rather than suturing historical and political lapses  articulates the experience of the transition as a process of rupture:  “If the transitional period is first and foremost a fissure in and of  history, then we can only have partial access to it through a broken  language, a process that is illustrated, for example, by Espinosa’s  and Martín Gaite’s literary texts, by the journalism of Triunfo and  </page> <page sequence="11"> Uncommon Sense 347 by the documentaries of Cecilia Bartolomé and Victoria Prego.”46  Certainly, Martín Gaite was an outspoken critic against the limita- tions of consensual truths and against those stories that are told  as though they are the only possible ones. In El cuento de nunca  acabar, for example, she complains about what she calls “uncon- taminated tales,” that is, those stories that imitate the aseptic and  unproblematic shape of the news broadcast, a form of narration  that occludes dissent. Dissent, Martín Gaite goes on to argue, is  preferable to the kind of agreements that result from hasty pacts  and inauthentic consensus. “Peace and harmony are not possible  unless one explores the paths of disagreement and leaves behind  all kinds of safe havens.”47 Martín Gaite perceptively noted that to explore truly “contra- dictory versions” in democratic Spain became, ironically enough,  more difficult than it was before Franco’s death. For instance, in  a 1984 article originally published in the liberal newspaper Cam- bio 16, she argues that the press in postauthoritarian Spain uses  the abstract notion of “freedom of speech” as an alibi to curtail  the reader’s capacity to disagree with editorial criteria. Even if  disagreement is voiced, she argues, it is duly included within the  “Letters to the Editor” section, a mechanism that assimilates dis- sident voices to a “formidable forum” that tends to incorporate  “all possible opinions.”48 As described by Martín Gaite, the press  functions like the new democratic system by embracing venerable  notions such as common sense, freedom of speech, and the will of  the people to multiply the roads of legitimacy and power but also  to create a more effective and encompassing mechanism of social  control and containment. Under these new circumstances, C.’s love letters in El cuarto  de atrás, like those sent by disgruntled citizens to newspaper  offices, no longer represent an act of transgression. In a society  founded on common sense and defined by political pluralism,  freedom of speech, and sexual liberation—a society, that is, where  the dissidence symbolized by the back room is no longer publicly  repressed—neither the rebellious contents of C.’s letters nor their  metafictional elements can pose an alternative to the language  of power. Although both Francoism and the transition sought to  reduce the many to the rule of the one, they employed different  mechanisms of command and discipline. To be sure, the postdicta- torial democratic governments in Spain did not attempt to perpetu- ate an authoritarian, official ideology. They suppressed censorship  in artistic circles, restored freedom of the press, and recognized  the legal status of leftist parties. However, the content of citizen- ship and the form of society were still determined by a hegemonic  </page> <page sequence="12"> 348 José Luis Venegas narrative that embraced market-driven modernization and politi- cal consensus as the new values that should unify individual citizens  into a cohesive and forward-looking collectivity. Despite its dem- ocratic basis, this public discourse established a system of exclu- sions, restrictions, and omissions, since the desirable goals of social  stability and successful integration into a free market economy  demanded the erasure of the scars of history, of the crimes and  memories that had created divisions, chaos, and civil strife in the  past. While the dictatorial regime embodied what Michael Hardt  and Antonio Negri, following Michel Foucault, call “disciplinary  power,” the democratic system shaped a “society of control.” “Dis- ciplinary power” rules through the consolidation of parochial and  rigid hierarchies, by “structuring parameters and limits of thought  and practice, sanctioning and prescribing normal and/or deviant  behaviors.”49 In contrast, in a “society of control” power is exercised  in a more “democratic” manner, by turning social control into a  matter of consent and “common sense,” that is, into a “vital func- tion that every individual embraces and reactivates of his or her  own accord.”50 Appeals to core cultural values such as “freedom”  and “consensus” (which in postauthoritarian Spain came to sub- stitute for or coexist with other traditional values such as belief in  God, the family, and the nation) create social and political consent  and enabled “‘common-sense’ understandings” of the transition.51  However, these “freedoms”—freedom of speech, political free- dom, market freedom—only obtain within a system of regulations  that allow the controlling institutions (the government, the law,  the market) to dictate the ways in which individual citizens should  interpret and understand reality.52 Once Franco died and the disciplinary power that he  personified began to erode, C.’s adolescent letters were no lon- ger unacceptable expressions of disagreement. “Today,” the pro- tagonist tells her visitor, “boldness is a synonym for spontaneity,  something a woman flaunts to prove her lack of preconceived ideas  and inhibitions.”53 The metafictional features that characterize C.’s  letters fail to defy the forms of power embraced by the “societies  of control.” To affirm that “reality” is a constructed notion that is  always mediated by the arbitrariness of language and writing cer- tainly undercuts “disciplinary power” and its forms of expression.  However, a poetics of self-referentiality loses its subversive edge  in a society such as democratic Spain, where the structure and  logic of power is no longer defined through “essential identities,  binary divisions, and stable oppositions.”54 One can argue, follow- ing Hardt and Negri, that in this postauthoritarian setting, literary  writing, either as fiction or metafiction, runs the risk of losing its  </page> <page sequence="13"> Uncommon Sense 349 ability to express radical dissidence and might even be complicit  in the reproduction of a dominant order that thrives on mobility  and play. The transitional period in Spain witnessed the proliferation of  lite genres such as best-selling detective fiction, erotica, historical  thrillers, and urban chronicles of drug abuse along with self-ref- erential novels in which formal experimentation shifts the read- er’s attention from social issues to the inner workings in the text.  Both the commercial boom of popular fictional modes and the  cultivation of sheer linguistic playfulness could be interpreted as  symptoms of the political sterility of transition-era literature. But  among the barrage of banal artistic manifestations that followed  the demise of the dictatorial regime, we can still find sophisticated  novels such as Manuel Vázquez Montalbán’s Los mares del sur (1979)  and Eduardo Mendoza’s El misterio de la cripta embrujada (1979) that  draw on the generic features listed above, referential language,  and popular and mass culture to express nonconformity with the  official policies of the transition. Similarly, one can identify novel- ists who embrace technical experimentation during this period but  refuse to sever ties between the text and society. For writers such as  Miguel Espinosa, Lourdes Ortiz, and José María Guelbenzu, exper- imenting with new literary forms became a politically motivated  aesthetic choice—an attempt to articulate desacuerdo (“disagree- ment”) in post-Franco Spain. As Ramón Buckley rightly points out,  Martín Gaite is one of those writers who transitioned with the Span- ish transition, as she definitely abandoned the social realism of  her early writing career to explore new aesthetic options. Buckley  points out that the political transition to democracy “becomes the  condition for her own ‘transition.’”55 Although the political and  the literary transitions coincided chronologically, they followed  divergent paths. While the country’s political transition embraced  consensual truths and pacts as the limits of the possible, the nov- elist’s literary transition was defined by a commitment to break  with those imposed limits and to welcome the reader into a “world  turned topsy-turvy,” as Martín Gaite puts it in her dedication of El  cuarto de atrás to Lewis Carroll.56 These aesthetic transformations are powerfully evoked in the  novel by C.’s burning of the papers that she had kept for years  inside a tin chest, which used to belong to her mother. These docu- ments included diaries, drafts of a novel that C. cowrote with a  school friend about the imaginary isle of Bergai, and C.’s adoles- cent love letters, including the letters from her Portuguese flame.  The burning of these papers is symptomatic of the narrator’s desire  to move beyond solipsistic writing that can only build a protective  </page> <page sequence="14"> 350 José Luis Venegas barrier against the restrictions of reality and the deadening grip  of habit and convention. With this literary transition, the very pur- pose and function of writing has to be rethought. According to the  man in black—whose accurate critical remarks always hit “the nail  square in the head,” as the narrator affirms—literature should be  a “defiance of logic” rather than “a refuge against uncertainty.”57  It should abandon the task of constructing an autonomous coun- terdiscourse, a retreat that opposes the laws, myths, and pacts that  shape social life but fails to question the logic behind them. To do  so, the narrator follows the unpredictable paths of the fantastic,  which Tzvetan Todorov, a reference of choice for C., defines not as  a marvelous realm disconnected from the world but rather as that  “hesitation” that a person experiences when confronted by events  that seem to elude the “laws of nature.”58 Refusing to isolate this  moment of hesitation and uncertainty from how the world really  is constitutes the first step in shaking up the dictates of common  sense. Following Todorov but also Lewis Carroll, to whom the book  is fittingly dedicated, the narrator in El cuarto de atrás chooses not to  dispel the ambiguities surrounding her mysterious encounter with  the man in black. As critics have asked repeatedly, are we reading  about a dream, a drug-induced hallucination, or an actual situa- tion? Is the man in black a real person or a figment of her imagina- tion? Who is writing the pile of folios that mysteriously grows as the  night goes on?59 This defiant interrogation of the structures of common sense  is carried out not only through the thematic attention to fantas- tic elements but also through a break with denotative language as  a form of communication and representation, a mechanism that  intersects with Martín Gaite’s use of epistolarity in the novel. After  all, as C. declares, “fantastic literature has a great deal to do with  letters that reappear.”60 This linguistic defiance of common sense is  suitably enacted by the letters that Carola finds in a suitcase in his  attic (another back room) and by the mysterious blue letter that C.  comes across while searching the contents of a sewing basket that  she keeps in her bedroom. If the little tin chest where she kept her  old love letters and the Bergai journals represents the outmoded  narrative models that the author seeks to abandon—indeed to  “burn”—the sewing basket and the false-bottomed valise that holds  the letters found by Carola stand for a new mode of writing that  articulates dissidence against “common sense” on a linguistic rather  than thematic level. The valise is an heirloom inherited by Alejan- dro, presumably Carola’s partner, after the death of his father. Sym- bolically, this valise and its contents (a collection of letters that C.  might have written to Alejandro in the past) can be connected with  </page> <page sequence="15"> Uncommon Sense 351 the new form of storytelling that she embraces after the incinera- tion of the old archive (the tin chest) and the disappearance of  a paternal figure (Franco, Alejandro’s father). The letters in the  valise bear some traces of the actual letters that C. kept in her tin  trunk (they seem to be love letters), but they also reproduce the  fantastic hesitation and uncertainty that permeates the novel. They  bear no names or dates and mostly describe dreams, making it  difficult to determine who authored them, when, and why. This association with the world of dreams is not the only way in  which the letters transgress the boundaries of reality and common  sense; their recalcitrance to verbalization also separates them from  the realm of certainty and actuality. To provide feelings with lin- guistic shape is, as C. claims, “an infallible way of making them take  on reality.”61 “As soon as I see my handwriting,” she says, “the things  it refers to turn into dried-up butterflies that just a while ago were  flitting about in sunlight. That’s exactly what happens when I wake  up from a dream.”62 Quite fittingly, the narrator’s request to have  Carola read to her some of the letters in the valise is never fulfilled.  In this sense, these mysterious letters are emblematic of what C.  enigmatically describes as a “dreamed text, vague and fleeting, that  precedes the actual one that is actually recited and is swept away  by it.”63 The best expression of this extraverbal dimension is perhaps  the mysterious letter penned on light blue paper that C. finds at  the bottom of a sewing basket in the opening chapter. Like the  false-bottomed suitcase, this basket functions, as some commenta- tors have noticed, as a metonym for Martín Gaite’s narrative style  in El cuarto de atrás. According to Debra Castillo, this object, a sort  of metaphorical archive, “has supplanted all the other abandoned  boxes of her career,” most notably the little tin chest.64 The con- tents of the basket, a bunch of diverse items “all tangled up in col- ored thread,” vividly evoke the “miscellaneous junk” of the back  room but also the rich narrative texture of El cuarto de atrás, a novel  where one can find elements from romantic fiction (novelas rosa),  detective stories, fantastic literature, fairy tales, popular culture  and folklore, and high literary works, including those by Miguel  de Cervantes, Daniel Defoe, and Franz Kafka, among others.65  The fact that the letter is buried under all these objects suggests  that this document could be understood as a sort of underlying  scriptural model or urtext for El cuarto de atrás, here metaphori- cally represented by the diverse contents of the sewing basket. Like  the letters that Carola finds in Alejandro’s valise, this one lacks any  factual details regarding the identity of the sender or the circum- stances surrounding its composition. In addition, the contents of  </page> <page sequence="16"> 352 José Luis Venegas the letter—which describe the vague feelings of nostalgia of a man  who misses the protagonist as he sits on a deserted beach gazing at  the horizon—fuse with a dreamlike situation where C. finds herself  on the same beach. As in a Möbius strip, the letter and the dream  loop into each other, blurring the boundaries between fantasy and  reality. However, the most disorienting aspect of this letter is not its  association with the world of dreams but rather its departure from  the notion of language as representation and as transparency. In  other words, what breaks with the structures of reality and common  sense in this letter is not so much what the text means, what it is  about, but how it suggests new forms of meaning and sense that do  not depend on the stability of linguistic signs and codes. A peculiar feature of the letter in the sewing basket is that  it contains combinations of alphabetical letters that while still  forming words with stable meanings also enter into patterns and  configurations that escape the constraints and regulations of lin- guistic representation. A large portion of the letter consists of lines  spelling the protagonist’s name, “written between dashes and small  letters, with crests and troughs imitating the ocean waves.”66 These  lines, where letters are both graphemes and pictographic elements,  combine articulate language and the kind of semantic processes  found in pictogram poems such as “Fury Said to a Mouse” in Lewis  Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, where meaning is partly conveyed  through pictorial resemblance to an animal’s tail. In this sense,  this mysterious letter, while still a readable text that represents an  actual situation (the mystery lover gazing into the sea), opens a  path of escape from established sense-making mechanisms, lead- ing us into a labyrinthine textual network where those mechanisms  coexist with forms of signification that do not depend on linguistic  conventions. As the man in black indicates, in order to make the  passage from literature as “refuge” to literature as “defiance,” one  must begin to understand the literary text as a “labyrinth” rather  than as a “fortified castle.”67 Unlike the “paper castles” that young  C. built around herself with love letters and fantastic narratives,  this labyrinth is no longer shaped exclusively by the ordered struc- tures of referential language. This is not to say, however, that Martín Gaite’s stylistic transi- tion in El cuarto de atrás involves a total repudiation and abandon- ment of the referential capacities of language. In later novels such  as La Reina de las Nieves (1994) and Lo raro es vivir (1995), she enacts  substantial criticism toward the conciliatory politics and culture of  the transition on the level of content. Both novels make several  references to Spain’s Francoist past to stress the contrast between  personal memories and the nation’s collective amnesia. In La Reina  </page> <page sequence="17"> Uncommon Sense 353 de las Nieves, for instance, she highlights the connection between  memory and history by evoking the national past as an archive  where old letters rebel like “soldiers who break rank and walk not  only backward to recover what happened earlier . . . but also, some- times, without meaning to, get stuck in lost fragments of our own  memory.”68 Martín Gaite’s fiction discourages us from identifying  referential language (the kind of language found in the archive  and embodied by the rebellious letter-soldiers in La Reina de las  Nieves) with official discourse or conformity in a straightforward  and unproblematic manner. Even in the more formally daring and experimental El cuarto de  atrás, the labyrinthine textual network opened by the blue letter is  still embedded in a story (C.’s encounter with the man in black in  the middle of a stormy night) that follows the conventions of real- istic mimesis and refers to actual historical events (e.g., the bomb- ings that took place in Salamanca during the Spanish Civil War,  the assassination attempt on Hitler, and the telecast of Franco’s  funeral). The graphemic sequences and patterns contained in the  mysterious missive that C. comes across at the beginning of the  novel should not be understood as an alternative to realistic rep- resentation; instead, they should be understood as a perforation  of that representational surface or even as parasitic linguistic ele- ments that, within but also against the ordered structures of refer- ential language, encourage the reader to explore what Martín Gaite  calls “the unpredictable paths that the story itself presents.”69 Fol- lowing Roland Barthes, one could say that the meaning associated  with the blue letter does not indicate an outside of conventional  meaning—a marvelous “elsewhere” like Bergai or the protagonist’s  love letters—nor is it “directed against meaning,” as happens in  narcissistic or metafictional texts. Rather, this “obtuse” meaning  “outplays meaning—subverts not the content but the whole prac- tice of meaning. A new—rare—practice affirmed against a majority  practice (that of signification), obtuse meaning appears necessarily  as a luxury, an expenditure without exchange.”70 In sum, the pro- ductivity of “obtuse meaning” does not depend on the “exchange  value” of sound patterns and their graphic representations—that  is, on the demands that representation places on words to make  sense of things. The blue letter opens up an alternative pattern of semantic  associations not only through its pictographic designs but also by  fostering the kind of meaning generated by puns and anagrams.71  The words in the letter, starting with C’s name, correlate not  only with signifieds but also with other “things beginning with a  C.” Thus, the protagonist’s name initiates a process of linguistic  </page> <page sequence="18"> 354 José Luis Venegas dispersion that, like the apocryphal letters that she used to send to  herself, abolish the notion of stable identity but also that of stable  sense-making processes. C’s name therefore ceases to be a proper  name designating an anthropomorphic character and becomes  the starting point of a series of interrelated words that no longer  function as referential signs. Thus, it is the letter “C” that connects  the narrator with the objects that she draws on the sand of a dream- like beach, perhaps the same beach that the author of the blue  letter describes: “What color am I using and what letter? The C of  my name, three things beginning with C, a casa first, then a cuarto,  and then a cama.”72 As Castillo has perceptively noted, this initial  sequence of cosas en C is cumulative and extends throughout the  whole novel. Thus, the casa, cuarto, cama, colcha, carta, and cesta de  costura (“house,” “room,” “bed,” “bedspread,” “letter,” and “sewing  basket”) in the opening chapter are connected through alphabeti- cal correspondence with other prominent objects and names in  the text, including Carola, Cúnigan, cajón, cuaderno, cucaracha, and  cajita (“drawer,” “notebook,” “cockroach,” and “pillbox”). The setting where the protagonist has her dream or reverie of  the beach shares important elements with another thing beginning  with “C,” the carta that she finds in the cesta de costura. For example,  the only sound that can be heard in the cuarto at night, that of water  splashing into a fountain, is reminiscent of the waves that reverber- ate in the letter. Similarly, both in the cama and the carta, alphabeti- cal letters form visual patterns rather than words: the waves made  up of C’s name in the letter closely resemble the wavy tilde over the  letter “n” (ñ) that serve as the decorative pattern of the bedspread  (colcha).73 In addition, the fabric (el género) of the colcha in the cama  in the cuarto has blue tones (like the paper in which the carta is writ- ten) and bears a name that the narrator cannot remember. Like  the “things beginning with a C,” the indistinct género (Spanish for  “fabric” but also for “gender” and “genre”) of the colcha and the  carta evokes a kind of social and literary transgression that is no  longer carried out only by the referential function of language;  it is also carried out by the linguistic distortions associated with  puns and wordplay. Martín Gaite subtly emphasizes the symbiotic  or parasitic relationship between referential and graphic meanings  as they blur gender, genre, and identity boundaries when she has  C. speculate that the blue letter in the sewing basket might be one  of her own apocryphal writings, a possible letter to C. from herself  (with a masculine identity). Once one comes across patterns of graphic or phonic repeti- tion that are not “easily resolvable into regular signs,” to use Jon- athan Culler’s words, one “begins to think of letters as possible  </page> <page sequence="19"> Uncommon Sense 355 constituents of other patterns,” of new configurations of meaning.74  These new connections among phonemes and graphemes under- mine language as a system of signs as well as the related abstract  notion of common sense. As Gilles Deleuze argues in The Logic of  Sense, the concept of common sense is inextricably bound up in the  idea of language as a structure. Common sense, what “everybody  knows,” is in Deleuze’s formulation a linguistic effect that coor- dinates the distribution of words and concepts—of signifiers and  signifieds—in a fixed and predictable way. That is to say, common  sense is that “faculty of identification that brings diversity in general  to bear upon the form of the same”—a faculty that subordinates  language to a given order of truth, to a doxa.75 Within the domain  of common sense, language is a system of signs whose function is to  represent a recognizable image of the world. The function of com- mon sense is therefore to contain difference, to assemble form and  meaning in a systematic manner while presenting such assemblage  as the only possible one, as the way things really are. Deleuze’s examples from Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland (a prom- inent subtext in El cuarto de atrás) show that language can destroy  this mechanism of common sense when the word’s “phonic ele- ments” are not used to denote universal or general concepts. When  “language is stripped of its sense, its phonic elements become sin- gularly wounding.”76 Combinations of sounds and letters like those  observed in puns such as género and the sequences of “C” words  found in El cuarto de atrás upset the fixed distribution of meaning  on which common sense depends. If common sense traps language  within a motionless image of the world, wordplay and puns turn  the production of sense into an arbitrary though carefully crafted  process that eludes established regimes of shared cultural sense  and political legislation. These linguistic configurations surreptitiously perforate the  fabric of the official discourse of the transition, particularly what  Joan Ramon Resina calls its “tidy Platonic paradigm”—that is, its  totalizing scope and its eradication of radical dissent. In order  to approach this paradigm critically, Resina argues, one should  descend “to the neglected detail, the trifling, and the parochial,  as excluded surfaces jarring the model’s smooth border.”77 In  Martín Gaite’s novel, those trifling details manifest themselves as  verbal arrangements that spin off, launch, and explore new direc- tions (indeed, new senses) beyond the Platonic purview of com- mon sense. The political dimension of epistolarity in the novel,  its opposition to the rhetorical underpinnings of the public dis- course of the transition, is made manifest at the level of form.  Specifically, Martín Gaite’s use of epistolarity disrupts the public  </page> <page sequence="20"> 356 José Luis Venegas narrative (consensus, reform, modernization, and political pacts  between the Left and the Right in the case of the Spanish transi- tion) that “becomes so embedded in common sense as to be taken  for granted and not open for question.”78 The “partition of the sen- sible” that common sense performed during the transition years  anticipated and determined, in Rancière’s formulation, “the distri- bution of shares and social parties. And this distribution itself pre- supposes a cutting up of what is visible and what is not, of what can  be heard and what cannot, of what is noise and what is speech.”79  Through such distributive process, common sense represses or sets  aside those elements that might contradict or disrupt the image of  the world that it creates, an image that is presented as self-evident  rather than as the result of a series of calculated omissions. If the  discourse of the transition is totalizing, this is not because it relies  on the language as a referential instrument but instead because it  uses that instrument to create what Martín Gaite calls a “thanatos”  narrative that falls on the reader like an “avalanche that does not  admit controversy” and “demands unfailing acceptance.”80 What infuses the blue letter in El cuarto de atrás with politi- cal significance is its capacity to let “obtuse meaning” trickle out  from under the tightly secured gates of common sense. This seep- age undermines the principal meaning-producing mechanism of  the official discourse of the transition, namely the deployment of  “thanatos” narratives to shape and control the public sphere. The  blue letter does this by ceasing to operate according to the rules of  representation and mimesis, not to condemn referential language  as necessarily or intrinsically conservative or repressive but rather  to become a rabbit hole into a labyrinth where, as happens in  Alice’s Wonderland, language loses its bearings and breaks with the  univocal sameness of common sense. In this submerged linguistic  maze, letters, whether alphabetical or postal, become phonic ele- ments that form unexpected configurations that are not limited by  the commonsensical social text of the transition. Epistolarity in El cuarto de atrás functions as an ever-changing  form of textual resistance to the logic of rule, whether dictatorial or  democratic. The epistolary documents found in the novel acquire  diverse aesthetic shapes, shifting from fictional renderings of trans- gressive behavior to metafictional questionings of mythical forms  of historiography to a mode of writing that disrupts the boundar- ies of common sense in order to preserve its critical dimension  within a “society of control,” such as that of post-Franco Spain.  With this final shift, the postal letter, the carta, becomes just one  more “thing beginning with C ” whose meaning depends on pho- nic (or graphic) correspondence rather than on the conventions  </page> <page sequence="21"> Uncommon Sense 357 of mimetic representation and referential language. As a result  of this final transformation (or transition), epistolarity opens up  a regime of sense whereby heterogeneous noises (those elements  that common sense separates from what counts as speech) produce  a submerged text, vague and fleeting, that violates the narrative  pacts of post-Franco Spain.

Other novels by Martín Gaite where epistolary writing features prominently  include Fragmentos de interior (1976) and Nubosidad variable (1992). As José Jurado  Morales points out, the proliferation of letters in Martín Gaite’s novels can be attrib- uted to the confessional mode of many of her works. See José Jurado Morales, La  trayectoria narrativa de Carmen Martín Gaite (1925–2000) (Madrid: Gredos, 2003),  449–50. Martín Gaite’s use of letters in her fiction can also be related to her concep- tion of literature as essentially a form of dialogic communication that always involves  an actual or imagined interlocutor or addressee.

While authors such as Buckley himself  and Morodo propose that this historical period began in 1968 along with increasing  manifestations of public and political unrest in Spain and the rest of Europe, others  such as Teresa Vilarós suggest that the transition begins with the assassination of  Franco’s prime minister, Luis Carrero Blanco, in 1973 and ends with the signing  of the Maastrich Treaty, which fulfills Spain’s modernizing (and Europeanizing)  dreams by integrating the country within the European Union. See Teresa Vilarós,  El mono del desencanto: Una crítica de la transición española (1973–1993) (Madrid: Siglo  Veintiuno, 1998). In this essay I will focus on the early years of the transition to  democracy, between Franco’s death in 1975 and 1978, when the new democratic  Spanish Constitution was approved and El cuarto de atrás was published. </page> <page sequence="22"> 358 José Luis Venegas 7.

In this article Martín Gaite echoes Subirats’s  condemnation of the frenetic consumerism and sheer hedonism that seized Spanish  society after Franco’s death. For Martín Gaite, a society ruled by the fleeting pleasures  provided by television sets, music players, and drugs is defined more by cultural  impoverishment than by liberating freedom. This critical attitude toward the effects  of modernization in Spain is also prominent in her novel Fragmentos de interior (1976),  which she completed while working on El cuarto de atrás. Fragmentos de interior vividly  evokes the fast-paced transformation of Spain during the last days of Francoism and  the beginning of the transition years; the novel portrays the progressive liberation  of women, the modernization of society, and the steady breakdown of traditional  values but also stresses the banalization of life associated with these rapid changes. </page> <page sequence="24"> 360 José Luis Venegas 40.
