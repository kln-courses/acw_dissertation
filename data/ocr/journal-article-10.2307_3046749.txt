<plain_text><page sequence="1">MINIATURES OF THE FABLES OF BIDPAI AND OF THE LIFE OF AESOP IN THE PIERPONT MORGAN LIBRARY BY MYRTILLA AVERY A MONG the treasures in the manuscript section of The Pierpont Morgan Library is a collection of ancient folk-tales (Ms 397) written in a Greek script which has been placed and dated as South Italian of the late tenth century.' The following texts are found on its one hundred and twelve folios: a fragment of the Fables of Bidpai, or Kalilah and Dimnah, fols. I r-7; Physiologus,2 fols. 8r-2I v; Life of Aesop, fols. 22r--67v; two hundred and twenty-six fables of Aesop, fols. 67v-Io8r; thirty-one of the fables of Babrius,3 fols. Io8r--II12; seven of the "witty sayings" (aoarEa) from the Philogelos of Hierocles and Philagrios,4 fol. I 2'v. Of these texts, only the Bidpai fables and the Life of Aesop are illustrated. The Bidpai fragment has been edited and published by Mrs. Elinor Husselman of the University of Michigan,5 who discovered that the Morgan text was unique and earlier than the current Greek version. The text of the Life and Fables of Aesop has been described and discussed at some length by Professor B. E. Perry of the University of Illinois,6 who found the Life to be "the oldest form in which we know it." Professor Perry will include the complete Morgan text of the Life and Fables, with commentary and notes, in his forth- coming comprehensive edition of the principal versions.7 I. See The Pierpont Morgan Library, Exhibition of Il- luminated Manuscripts held at the New York Public Library, Catalogue ... by Belle da Costa Greene and Meta P. Harrsen, New York, 1934, P. 7. 2. The Physiologus, ancestor of the Bestiaries, generally believed to have been compiled in Alexandria in the second or early third century A.D. The Morgan text has been briefly discussed by Professor B. E. Perry in his review of Sbordone's edition of the Greek text of the Physiologus, in which he pronounces it to be "the best and probably also the oldest of all Greek manuscripts of the Physiologus" (see American fournal of Philology, LVIII, 1937, 492). Since the Morgan text is not included in Sbordone's study, Pro- fessor Perry has promised to publish an edition in the near future. No Greek text earlier than the eleventh- or twelfth- century Smyrna manuscript (lost in the fire of 1922 but published by Strzygowski, Der Bilderkreis des griechischen Physiologus, Leipzig, 1899) is known, but evidences that one existed have been adduced in an article on the ninth- century Physiologus in the Stadtbibliothek at Bern by Helen Woodruff (ART BULLETIN, XII, 1930, 226-53). 3. Fables in Greek choliambic verse by Babrius, probably a Roman of the first century A.D. (cf. Ox. Papyrus 1249). The name has been thought to be oriental, perhaps Syrian. The Morgan text has been published by Elinor Mullett Husselman, "A Lost Manuscript of the Fables of Babrius" (American Philological Association, Transactions, LXVI, 1935, o04-26). 4. This collection known under the title btX6yeXws EK reov "IEpOKCXOUS K itXayplov 7patar-Kav has been edited by A. Eberhard (Berlin, 1869). It consists of two hundred and sixty-four witticisms, generally satirical, of which the first one hundred and three have as their targets scholars and clever lawyers; following these, a miscellaneous group includes the witty and the witless, misers, swindlers, cow- wards, drunkards, and finally men afflicted with halitosis (bIb6aroIo); at the end is an appendix of miscellaneous sub- jects, some of which repeat those in the earlier groups, sug- gesting that this collection is a redaction of earlier writings by the two otherwise unknown grammarians. A terminus post quem is supplied in an allusion (Eberhard edition, p.19, ?62) to the Thousand Year Festival of the city of Rome (248 A.D.), but the language of the collection is said to indicate a later date, certainly not earlier than the fourth century (see Christ-Schmid, Gesch. der griech. Lit., 6th ed., II, Io49f [Iwan von Miiller, Handbuch der klass. Altertums- wissenschaft, vii, II, 2]). A brief study of the Morgan fragment is promised by Professor B. E. Perry, who has noticed one new "witticism" among its seven airda. 5.

A brief discussion of the miniatures in the Morgan codex was originally intended to supplement a joint pub- lication of the texts by Mrs. Husselman and Professor Perry, but circumstances preventing this, they have kindly permitted me to utilize their studies in this article.

Sprengling of the Oriental Insti-</page><page sequence="2">104 THE ART BULLETIN All the published studies of the texts agree in showing that the Morgan codex is a copy by a rather ignorant and careless scribe, of another Greek manuscript which was mutilated when the copy was made. There are many lacunae and obvious errors. Nevertheless, the codex is of cardinal importance to students of folk-tales, since it contains the earliest known Greek translation of Bidpai fables, probably the oldest known Greek manuscript of the Physiologus, the earliest known version of the Life and Fables of Aesop, four complete fables of Babrius not found elsewhere, and a new "witticism" in the short fragment of the Philogelos. Every one of the six texts in Morgan MS 397, therefore, makes unique contribu- tion to the study of its subject. Added to this is the important discovery made by Mrs. Husselman that this codex is no other than the one formerly numbered A 33 in the library of the Basilian monastery of Grottaferrata, missing, according to Rocchi's catalogue of that library, since the Napoleonic wars and long lamented by Aesopic scholars.8 In such a manuscript the miniatures have an interest quite regardless of their obvious aesthetic defects. Their resemblance to certain Exultet Rolls was noted on sight by the dean of American stylistic critics of Italian painting,9 and anyone familiar with early South Italian miniatures will recognize at once the characteristic peculiarities. Although only two of the six texts were planned for illumination, these two were to be copiously illustrated: the Bidpai fragment with twenty-one miniatures, and the Life of Aesop with fifty-eight miniatures, of which seven were executed and the remaining fifty-one spaces left unfilled."' There are no unfilled spaces in the Bidpai text. These illustrations were planned and the miniatures (except a later insertion on fol. 59v) were drawn and painted before the text was written. This is apparent from the way the script is neatly fitted around the figures in numerous instances," and if further proof is needed, the writing is clearly over the color on folios I', 2', 22V (Figs. 2; 4, accent; 20). The Fables of Bidpai, the famous beast stories of Sanscrit origin, said to have been told to an Indian king of the third or fourth century A. D. by his philosopher, Bidpai, were trans- lated into Pahlavi in the sixth century, and from Pahlavi into Arabic about 750.12 Soon tute of Chicago for his courtesy in making available to me the Institute's valuable collection of photographs of Bidpai manuscripts; also the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University for use of its material on Arabic illumination; and I take this opportunity to express appreciation of the co6peration of Miss Belle da Costa Greene, whose gener- osity in putting at the disposal of scholars the abundant resources of the Morgan Library is well known. As the varied contents of this manuscript have led me into unfamiliar fields, I have consulted many scholars whose help I also gratefully acknowledge; in particular, Ben E. Perry of the University of Illinois; Richard Ettinghausen of the University of Michigan; Harold W. Glidden, recently of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem; Kurt Weitzmann of the Institute for Advanced Study; Helen Woodruff, Editor of the Princeton Index of Christian Art; and Sirarpie Der Nersessian of Wellesley College. 8. The argument for the identification of the Morgan manuscript as Cryptoferratensis A 33 is the subject of the first chapter (pp. 3-11) of Mrs. Husselman's edition of the Bidpai text (see note 5). This involved a collation and description of the Morgan codex from which the following items affecting the miniatures are repeated here: folios I and 8 are missing from the first gathering, i.e., before the present fol. I and after fol. 6; the manuscript was written by more than one hand, the first covering fols. 1-29; the script is "strongly reminiscent of manuscripts written in the Greek monasteries of South Italy. The date . .. should probably be set between 980 and io5o." 9. The entry for this manuscript in the Morgan Library catalogue, cited in note i, contains this comment: "Mr. Bernard Berenson . . . has placed the illumination of this manuscript in South Italy, with particular reference to the cruder Exultet Rolls." o0. Besides these, there are two crude drawings, obvi- ously casual interpolations: a sketch of a man in the space below the completed text of the Physiologus on folio 21', facing a portrait of Aesop at the beginning of the Life (Aesop? or possibly "the Physiologus," 6 0uvtoX6yos, the unidentified or imaginary author who is often quoted in the text); and a nondescript marginal drawing of a bust on fol. 46r, possibly an attempt to depict the Rustic, or the wife of Xanthus. ii. A convincing example of this appears on fol. 23r (Fig. 21) where the scribe, not having room to finish the word OKa7rrrev, wrote the last letter after the intruding foot of the figure at right. 12. The Pahlavi version was translated for a Sasanian king by his physician, Barzoe. It is known only through its translation into Arabic and into Syriac about 570. This Syriac translation from Pahlavi was displaced in the tenth or eleventh century by another one from the Arabic, after which the "Old Syriac" version was lost sight of until re-</page><page sequence="3">MINIATURES OF FABLES OF BIDPAI AND LIFE OF AESOP 105 after, both the Sanscrit original and the Pahlavi translation were lost, and the tales became widely known in East and West in the Arabic version under the title of Kalilah and Dimnah, from the Arabic form of the names of the two jackals whose deeds and sayings are the sub- ject of the first and principal portion of the fables. The current Greek translation from the Arabic was made about Io8o by Symeon Seth,'3 but the Morgan version differs widely from it. For convenient reference I have used the title Bidpai in this article, although the Morgan text is doubtless translated from the Arabic. The Morgan fragment contains parts of three of the last four fables of the Arabic transla- tion, as found in De Sacy's editio princeps.'4 All the introductory conversation between the Indian king and his philosopher, Bidpai, and the long story of Kalilah and Dimnah are therefore missing. The first of the three tales begins in the middle of the story, but from there on, except for a lacuna caused by a missing folio,15 the Morgan text seems to be con- tinuous to the end of the book. The second tale, the only one of the three which preserves its beginning, is introduced like other tales of the Arabic original, by a conversation between the Indian king and his philosopher, both of whom however are unnamed but described as "aforementioned." The ending of this tale and all the first part of the third are lost with the missing folio. After the third tale, the frame story is resumed in a moralizing conversation between the Indian king and his philosopher. The following description and discussion of the three fables in their relation to the Arabic and late eleventh-century Greek translations is a free quotation from Mrs. Husselman's monograph :16 The first tale is the story of the king's son and his three companions who met on a road. In the Arabic translation" the king's son maintains that all things are ordered by providence; the mer- chant's son extols understanding and education; the handsome son of a nobleman declares that beauty surpasses all else; the husbandman's son praises industry. When they arrive at a city, each man in turn is sent to procure food. The husbandman's son gathers wood and receives a piece of silver with which he buys a hearty meal for the four; the next day, the nobleman's son captures the fancy of a lady, who after a day's dalliance gives him 500 pieces of silver; the merchant's son by lucky trading makes a hundred thousand pieces. But on the fourth day, the king's son on arriving at the city finds that the king has just died, whereupon his royal blood being discovered, the king's son is made king. As his companions had written up their day's achievement on the city gate, the king's son also has inscribed upon it the legend that "Labor and beauty and knowledge and every- thing good are due to the providence of God." The three companions are then summoned to the king's court and rewarded. After their arrival several courtiers join in praise of the king's wisdom and one of them relates that when he was a slave he pledged himself to free a soul if thereby he might gain freedom. So he bought two doves with his last penny whereupon they led him to buried treasure. covered by chance in the nineteenth century (Gustav Bickell and Theodor Benfey, Kalilag und Damnag; alte syrische Ubersetzung des indischen Fiirstenspiegels, Leipzig, 1876). The Arabic version is the basis for translations into Ethiopic, Malay, Mongol, Turkish, Hebrew, Spanish, and the Greek version of about io8o referred to in the text. The Hebrew version was retranslated into Latin in the thir- teenth century by John of Capua, and on this text were based various translations into western European lan- guages. The bibliography is too extensive to be given here, but the reader is referred to I. G. N. Keith-Falconer, Kalilah and Dimnah; or, the Fables of Bidpai, Cambridge University Press, 1885. These tales, intended to teach "worldly wisdom of Machiavellian variety" by precept and example, are still current in India as the Panchatantra, in various versions. See Franklin Edgerton, The Panchatantra Reconstructed, 2 vols. (American Oriental Series, ii, III, New Haven, 1924). 13.

Mrs. Husselman bases her account of the Arabic tales on the translation into English of De Sacy's text by William Knatchbull (Kalilah and Dimnah, Oxford, 1819) and adds that in further studies she found no important variants in the three fables of the Morgan manuscript. Cf. her monograph, p. 14, note 8.</page><page sequence="4">Io6 THE ART BULLETIN When asked how they were able to perceive treasure and yet were not able to avoid the fowler's net they too ascribed all to providence. The whole of the first part of this story is lacking in the Morgan manuscript which begins with fifteen lines of Byzantine twelve-syllable verse in praise of fvroX~,, the divine decree. These verses, probably an elaboration of the king's inscription placed on the city gate, are inclosed in a full-page ornamental border representing a gate (Fig. I). The tale then proceeds in the Morgan version from the point at which the prince is made king of the city. The Greek version of Symeon Seth agrees with the Arabic translation but ends with the king's invitation to his three companions to share in the benefits of his court. In the second tale of the Morgan version a wolf leaves his cubs while he goes hunting. In his ab- sence a lion finds and eats the cubs. The wolf on his return laments loudly, calling for his children. When the mother-wolf returns, the parents bewail their loss and decide to lay their case before the king, who is called Azachar but shown as a lion in the miniatures. He reproaches the wolves, pointing out that they have caused others to suffer when they have eaten young animals. So they decide to eat figs. The birds begin to die of hunger and seek redress from the king. After a second admonition, the wolves begin to eat reptiles. These in turn complain to the king, who again summons the wolves. At this point occurs the lacuna in the text caused by the loss of a folio of the original gathering.s8 The Morgan version of this tale differs both from the Arabic and from the Greek translation of Symeon Seth. In both the Arabic and Seth versions a lioness leaves her cubs in a thicket, where a huntsman finds, kills, and skins, but does not eat them. The lamentations of the lioness are over- heard and she is reproached by a jackal, in the Arabic translation, and in the Seth translation, by a bear. In the latter, the lioness, convinced of the justice of the bear's reproof, leaves off eating flesh and lives on fruit for the rest of her life. Here the Greek tale ends, but the Arabic continues with a woodpigeon who complains that the lioness robs her of her accustomed food, whereupon the lioness decides to live on grass. The Morgan version is therefore again nearer to the Arabic than to the Seth translation. Certain variations from the Arabic may be due to misunderstanding of the language by the Greek translator."9 The substitution for the jackal of a king named Azachar might be explained as a transliteration of the Arabic word for jackal, ash-sha-'har, which the translator took for a proper name. So also theArabic word for herbage on which the lioness feeds is bashish which might have been confused with basharat, used of small reptiles or insects, or possibly with heishash, used of creeping insects. Since the end of the tale is missing in the Morgan text, we do not know whether the grass- eating incident was also included or not. The fragmentary third fable on the next folio (following the lacuna) begins with the last word of a sentence and reads as follows: "bare (,ibMvos). In the morning a man came along the road seeking white feathers. But when he reached the place he found black feathers and white. So he picked them up and went off. But the crow stood still when he saw the feathers going off and said: 'Alas, how miserable, greedy and senseless I am, since in seeking for white feathers I have lost my own black ones. ... ' So he spoke and not long after he died." The moral of this tale corresponds to that of the Arabic fable of the Hermit and his Guest, but the incident differs completely. In the Arabic and Seth versions a man visits a monk who speaks in Hebrew. The guest admires the language and wishes to learn it, but the monk dissuades him, relating the story of the crow that wanted to walk like a partridge but could neither acquire the new gait nor return to his natural manner. The loss of the folio between this tale and the one preceding makes it impossible to know whether this was a separate fable in the Morgan text or was connected with the story of the wolves. The latter is suggested by the moral immediately following which advises that we should be content with our own possessions "so that it may not happen to us as it happened to the aforesaid wolf and the afore- said black crow." This description will explain the following titles of the twenty-one miniatures re- produced in Figs. 1-18:20 18. See note 8. I9. Mrs. Husselman attributes to Professor Sprengling of the Oriental Institute of Chicago the discussion of Arabic words considered as possible sources of error which follows in the text. 20.

In the tale of the wolves, the lion is obviously eating the cub (Fig. 9) though in the Arab translation the huntsman kills and skins them. Mrs. Hussel- man's explanation of the substitution of "King Azachar" for a jackal as a misunderstanding of the Arabic is almost certainly valid, but I do not think his representation as a lion neces- sarily implies an Arab prototype for the miniature as she suggests,21 since in all the tales of Bidpai the lion is recognized as king. In the miniatures for the first tale, there are several minor evidences that the Morgan version was being followed. In summoning the three companions, the Morgan text specifies that they should be invited to eat at the king's court (thereby recognizing his obligation to provide a day's food), and accordingly they are shown seated at table (Fig. 4). Their cos- tume changes with their status at court: in Figure 2 they are shown just as they arrive and are agreeing whole-heartedly with the king's son that he was right and they were quite wrong; but in Figure 7, having been raised to high position, they are crowned and in court costume. Here too the Morgan text is followed, since in the Arabic translation only two of the companions are retained at court, the handsome man being rewarded with a sum of money, but sent away lest he should corrupt the morals of the ladies of the court. The close connection between the second and third fables, as brought out in the moral drawn from the third tale, certainly provides some reason for believing that the Morgan fragment (before it lost its two folios) was a copy of a continuous Greek translation of the last gathering of an Arab manuscript. If this gathering, probably mutilated, was all that the translator had in hand, it would explain the Byzantine versified amplification of the legend which now serves as an introduction to the fragmentary first tale (Fig. I) and, while written within an ornamental border suggesting the city gate, also takes its place as a deco- rated first page. A confirmation of this theory was supplied by Mr. Harold W. Glidden, 21. Mrs. Husselman's suggestion is that an Arabic minia- ture showed the lioness complaining to the jackal, but was misunderstood by the translator.</page><page sequence="10">o108 THE ART BULLETIN who kindly examined the Arabic texts and pointed out that the Greek translator who mis- took the Arabic word for jackal (as suggested by Mrs. Husselman) could not have known the preceding story of the Lion and Jackal (De Sacy, Chap. xIII) since in that tale the same word is used and explained.22 Professor Perry's erudite discussion of the Morgan Life of Aesop, though written for Aesopic scholars, is full of details of general interest, and to this the reader is referred. Here, only the conclusions immediately affecting a discussion of the miniatures are sum- marized, as follows: The Morgan Life of Aesop is the earliest version at present known except for papyrus fragments, and these show connections with the Morgan text. It goes back to an archetype composed or re- written between 1oo B.C. and 200 A.D., and for reasons explained, a date in the second century A.D. is probable.23 It has much substance not elsewhere extant, and differs in many significant details from the later and commonly known versions, which however also ultimately depend upon the same archetype.24 It appears to have been deliberately left out of the twelfth-century Paris manuscript (Bib. nat., suppl. 690o) "and from that time on no traces of it are found in any of the manuscripts of Aesop."25 An interesting feature indicative of an early date for the archetype is the important r61le assigned to Isis and the Muses. The text illustrated covers the following: (I) The description of Aesop, representing him as deformed and dumb; (2) The story of the figs intrusted by Aesop's master to servants, who having eaten them accuse Aesop, whereupon Aesop is summoned by his master and angrily reproached; being dumb he begs by signs to be allowed to demonstrate that not he but his accusers are the culprits; when this is proved the master orders that the false ac- cusers receive the punishment which was to have been imposed upon Aesop; (3) The ap- pearance to Aesop of a priestess of Isis who inquires the way to the city, and in return for his courteous treatment implores Isis to grant to Aesop the gift of speech; Aesop goes to sleep under a tree and awakens to find the prayer granted. The foregoing passages are illustrated in six of the seven scenes, filling six of the seven spaces on fols. 22r24r, one space in the lower right corner of fol. 22V being left unfilled. After fol. 24' there are forty-five unfilled spaces, but in the last space, where Aesop's exploits at the court of King Lycurgus are related, a later hand has inserted a crude representation of Aesop and the king. The titles of the seven scenes follow: i) Portrait of Aesop, fol. 22r (Fig. 19) 22. Mr. Glidden's note follows: "The name 'Araxdp is a transcription of the Arabic ja'har as it appears on p. 236, 266 ff. of De Sacy's edition of Kalilah and Dimnah, and shows that the ultimate source of the Morgan version was Arabic. As G. Bickell points out on p. LxxxIII of his Kalilag und Damnag (Leipzig, I896), ja'har is no Arabic word, but a pseudograph arising from the Arabic translator's mis- reading of the evidently unfamiliar word jagal in the Pahlavi original from which he was working. This mis- understanding arose from the ambiguity of the Pahlavi script itself, for in that alphabet the letters g, a, and I can also be read ', h and r. De Sacy's notes do not make clear what manuscript he was working from at this point, and only a comparison of his original material can answer that question. Since the scribe of the Morgan manuscript uses 'Aacxaip as a proper name, it is manifest that neither he nor the Greek translator whom he was probably following used an Arabic original containing the story of the Lion and Jackal given on p. 236 ff. of De Sacy's edition. If he had been familiar with this tale he would surely have known that aa'har meant jackal, since it is so explained (wa-huwa ibn-dwi) on p. 236 of De Sacy but not on p. 266 ff., which is the section corresponding to the version in the Morgan manuscript." 23.

Professor Perry adds in a personal letter: "This particular species of Graeco-Egyptian religious syncretism, i.e., Isis as mother (or leader) of the Muses, points rather definitely to Egypt (probably Alexandria) as the place where this version of the Blos was created.

The Aesop scenes, however, do not follow the text quite as faithfully as do those of the Bidpai cycle; e.g., the third scene (Fig. 21) shows the flogging, under the direction of the overseer, of only one of the false accusers, though the master orders both to be punished (Khvoowo abrTobs); and the tool which the sleep- ing Aesop hangs on the tree (Fig. 24) is a pickaxe, though called two-pronged (5iKEXXa) in the text.27 The Bidpai miniatures were first drawn in black ink and afterwards painted in dark green, red, and yellow gouache, heavily neutralized but often watered to paler shades; there is also a little light blue.28 The original lines of the Bidpai scenes, including the little foliate decoration on the skirt of some tunics (e.g., Fig. 5) are often obscured by the paint, but those for the Life of Aesop escaped the gouache except for some lines and accents in red. The portrait of Aesop (Fig. 19) is untouched, except for the pupils of the eyes and some red paint on tunic and legs. In the scene with the master of Aesop (Fig. 20) several lines in both figures have been retraced or restored; the master's arms, legs, and drapery are badly confused, but a comparison with the figure of the Bidpai king (Fig. 3) suggests the form of the original. The only redrawing of the figure of the priestess with Aesop (Fig. 22) is on the right side of her face and perhaps on the hands. In spite of a little retouching in black ink and red paint, the first four Aesop miniatures retain adequate evidence for the original figure style. The second figure of the priestess (Fig. 23), however, has been so much redrawn as to suggest at first that it was inserted by another hand; but the enigmatical lines of the drapery and meaningless red bands at the elbow reveal the work of the restorer.29 It was perhaps also 26. A. Westermann, ed., Vita Aesopi; ex vratislaviensi ac partim monacensi et vindobonensi codicibus nunc primum edidit, Brunswick, 1845. 27. It is quite possible that these divergences from the text result from careless copying. In the archetype, the background figure (Fig. 21) may have represented the second accuser awaiting his penalty like certain martyrs in the Menologia (an analogy suggested by Sirarpie Der Nersessian), but here clothed and given the gesture of address (or command); and a pickaxe is easier to draw than the two-pronged hoe or fork demanded by &amp;LKEXXa. In this connection it may be noted that Helen Woodruff, Editor of the Princeton Index of Christian Art, has observed that in general the more nearly one approaches an archetype, the more closely do the miniatures follow the text. 28. There is no chalky color, no wine red, clear ver- milion, deep blue (ultramarine), or lavender, such as is pre- served in the late tenth-century Borgia fragment of the Vatican Exultet Roll (Vat., lat. 9820), written at S. Vin- cenzo al Volturno (see M. Avery, The Exultet Rolls of South Italy, Princeton University Press, 1936, "Descriptive Notes," p. 32, pl. cxxxv. This publication will hereafter be cited under its title only.) The parchment is reserved only for flesh tones. Red lines on foreheads; red spots on cheeks, hands and ears, in the eyes of lions (fols. 6r, 6v) and birds (fol. 3r), and a tiny spot of red in the eye of the wolf cub (fol. 4r). Some pupils of eyes have been retouched and some meaningless black lines around mouths and chins (to indicate shadow?) are certainly later additions. Hair is dark green or blue, except that of the sleeping Aesop which is brown. Top and side knobs of king's crown usually red, but sometimes green or dull yellow. 29. The original garments of the priestess can probably be reconstructed from those of Virgo in the ninth-century Aratus manuscript at St. Gall (no. 902) to which the figure of the priestess bears close resemblance. The garments of the St. Gall Virgo consist of a long-sleeved, belted tunic</page><page sequence="12">IIo THE ART BULLETIN the restorer who was responsible for the mottled tunic of brown ink washes and cap-like hair of the sleeping Aesop (elsewhere bald). In other respects the style of the fifth and sixth scenes is not inconsistent with that of the first four. A comparison of the figure style which thus emerges in the Aesop scenes with that of the Bidpai figures shows marked similarities in general proportions, the relatively short upper legs, large hands, small feet, low foreheads, cap-like hair protruding in a bunch at the back, and in the peculiar profiles with long noses and sharply pointed chins. The negligent manner of indicating an ear by simply breaking out the contour of the cheek is seen also in the only two Bidpai examples not covered with paint (Figs. 4, 6); finally, the gesture of the right hand of the master of Aesop, with its two middle fingers bent under (Fig. 20), is identical with that of the right hand of all six Bidpai kings facing to the right (Figs. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 18). The costume and pose of the Bidpai king (Fig. 3) has been compared above with that of the master of Aesop. In both cycles, long garments are pulled tightly from ankle to thigh in the same manner. The seat with slender supports (reminiscent of a fald-stool) in three Bidpai scenes recurs as the seat for Aesop's master. The trees under which Aesop sleeps (Fig. 24), though retaining more naturalism than the fig-tree of the Bidpai scene (Fig. 13), show a similar type of conventionalization. From these comparisons it becomes evident that in spite of the different effect of the painted and unpainted scenes, there is in all these miniatures a consistent figure style, readily discernible in the first four Aesop scenes. The distinguishing features of this figure style are precisely those of early medieval Latin manuscripts from South Italy, where we find the same broken-down Latin style recognizable in characteristic movement, large hands in formulated gestures, small feet, a preference for twisting the head from profile to front view and, in some manuscripts from Campania and the Abruzzi, the peculiar drawing of nose and chin in profile. Costumes are classical de- rivatives frequently a little misunderstood. Animals are sympathetically drawn, often sug- gesting human qualities, but with a liking for patterns in fur or in the feathers of birds. To illustrate these details fully would require more space than could reasonably be expected here, especially as the evidence is cumulative, but the selection shown in Figures 26-41 will perhaps be adequate.30 The Bidpai kings and the master of Aesop sit on cross- legged stools like that of the emperor in the early eleventh-century Gaeta roll (Fig. 34). The falling to the ground, with an embroidered band running down the front; over this a mantle draped like a shawl hangs down behind, with one end draped over the left arm. There is no head covering but a small three-lobed ornament rises at the part of the hair (see Adolf Merton, Buchmalerei in St. Gallen, Leipzig, 1912, pl. 49). It is perhaps significant that the Alexandrian astronomers connected Isis with the sign of Virgo (Daremberg and Saglio, Dictionnaire, Paris, 1900, III, pt. I, 579). The corresponding figure of Virgo in the astronomical treatise of the Pseudo-Beda in the ninth-century Cassinese manuscript no. 3 (dated 874-92) is obviously based on the same archetype, but the classical reminiscences in the drapery are stronger and there is no band down the front of the tunic (cf. The Exultet Rolls of South Italy, pl. cxcv). The normal costume for attendants of Isis was similar to that of Isis herself; i.e., a long-sleeved, white robe reaching to the ground, a shawl knotted over the breast and a veil falling loosely from the head (cf. G. Lafaye, "Histoire du culte des divinites d'Alexandrie . . . ," Paris, 1884, Biblio- theque des Ecoles franqaises d'Athenes et de Rome, fasc. 33). However, the illustrations shown by Lafaye in his article on Isis in Daremberg and Saglio's Dictionary show many variants, among them a woman initiate wearing a kind of stole, passing under her right arm and hanging from the left shoulder (IIi, pt. i, 585, fig. 4105). Something similar, in alternate sections of red and black, appears on a terra- cotta statuette in the Fouquet collection, identified as Isis- Aphrodite by Paul Perdrizet in his Les terres cuites grecques d'Egypte de la collection Fouquet (Nancy, Paris, Strassburg, I921, I, 3, pl. II). The vertical band of the Morgan priestess, perhaps originally a stole, has been heavily retouched in black and red. The fine red line within the small curve in the outline above the forehead appears to be nothing more than retouching in red, but it is sometimes held that red on the forehead is characteristic of Isis figures. This theory is not substantiated by Eva Wunderlich in her exhaustive study of red in Greek and Roman cults ("Die Bedeutung der roten Farbe in Kultus der Griechen und R6mer," Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten, Giessen, xx, pt. I, 1925). In her long list of ideas and cults which employ red symbolically, some (e.g., the cult of the Sun) suggest its appropriateness for Isiac costume; but she also shows that red is well established as a symbol of evil, and quotes the following prayer to Isis: "O Isis, redeem me and deliver me from all base and evil red things." For this and other references I am indebted to Dr. Arthur D. Nock of Harvard. 30.

Vincenzo al Volturno (Fig. 36), and the same manuscript presents an unfinished background form (Fig. 35) recalling simi- larly abbreviated figures in the Morgan manuscript (Figs. 6, 21). Animals with form and movement like those of the Morgan miniatures are characteristic of the illustrations in the manuscript of Rabanus Maurus (Montecassino Ms 132) written at Montecassino before 1023 (Figs. 26-28). The fig-tree reminiscent of the Sasanian sacred tree, however, suggests by its strictly conventionalized form influence from South Italian Greek manuscripts of the tenth century written at Capua (cf. Fig. 41), rather than the more naturalistic tree and plant forms of manuscripts in Beneventan script.32 The extreme crudity of the patterns of the fig-tree is probably due in part at least to restoration, but the more naturalistic effect of plant forms in Beneventan miniatures, even when conventionalized, may be seen by comparing Figure 24 with Figure 31 or Figure 32. Although the Morgan miniatures are earlier, their closest parallels are seen in the eleventh-century Exultet Roll now at Pisa but certainly written in South Italy (Figs. 29- 30). The exact provenance of this manuscript is most unfortunately unknown, but con- nections with Campanian products can be detected, while the peculiar profile with sharply pointed chin persists in Abruzzese painting even as late as the thirteenth century.?3 Comparison of the Morgan miniatures with a chronologic series such as is provided by the Exultet Rolls (dating from the tenth to the thirteenth century) points to a date for the Morgan miniatures in the late tenth or early eleventh century and to a provincial scrip- torium. They show no close connections with Bari, but are loosely allied to early examples from Montecassino and S. Vincenzo al Volturno, with possibly some influence from Capua, where the monks of both monasteries were located in the late tenth and early eleventh century, having been driven from their homes by the Saracens early in the eighth decade of the ninth century. It must however be recognized that in spite of similarities in style between the Bidpai and Aesop scenes, certain characteristics of the Bidpai figures, such as the swollen cheeks and large eyes with drooping lower lids, suggest an archetype of different style from that which underlies the more Hellenistic treatment of the Aesop miniatures. Mrs. Husselman in her monograph is inclined to believe that the Bidpai miniatures originated in an Arabic prototype,34 and this conjecture can certainly be entertained, but I find nothing in existing Bidpai cycles to remove it from the realm of conjecture. The ex- treme scarcity, amounting practically to non-existence, of any examples of Arabic minia- tures before the thirteenth century leaves still unsolved the question of the style and general character of early Moslem illumination. Arabic scholars generally agree, however, that these early schools drew their inspiration from East Christian and Sasanian sources, with ferred to use the greater part of the plates at my disposal for the reproduction of all the miniatures of Morgan MS 397, in the hope that they may be utilized by scholars in the various fields upon which they touch. 31. Other miniatures in Cava Ms 4 show examples of the cross-legged chair, and peculiarities in the drawing of hands similar to those of the Morgan figures (cf. The Exultet Rolls of South Italy, pl. ccii). 32. Cf. the miniatures of the tenth-century Dioscorides now in Munich (E. A. Lowe, Scriptura Beneventana, Oxford, 1929, 1, pl.

The earliest known Bidpai cycle in an Arabic text (Paris, Bib. nat., Ms ar. 3465), generally dated about I22o and allied by style with the Paris Hariri (Bib. nat., Ms ar. 6094), shows this mingling of Early Christian and Persian characteristics. So also do the Morgan miniatures, and it might be tempting to see in this indications of an Arabic prototype, were it not for the well-known mingling of Early Christian and Sasanian influences in western illumination. The Early Christian style soon assimilated Sasanian characteristics, but in Arabic illumination the unfamiliar eastern customs and costume so color the effect that the Hellenistic qualities are almost submerged. There are without doubt many elements in the miniatures of Paris Ms ar. 3465 which are reminiscent of the Morgan scenes, such as the Sasanian preference for placing two figures at either side of a tree, one scene from an earlier fable (fol. 48r) showing two confronted jackals with noses at the tree, suggestive of the Morgan composition of the wolves eating figs; trees with leafy branches ending in large flowers or buds; the general appearance of animals and birds. But the Morgan miniatures use the sacred tree motive only once (Fig. 13), and that for a composition in which the tree was not an ornamental motive but an essential element in the illustration,35 while throughout Paris Ms ar. 3465 it is commonly used for any scene with more than one animal. The fald-stool appears several times in Paris Ms ar. 3465, but in a much more elaborate form, with four clearly-defined legs. The leafy trees of Paris MS ar. 3465 show none of the conventionalization of the Morgan trees, resembling rather those of Beneventan manuscripts. The lack of head coverings, which are demanded for persons of all stations in Arabic illumination, is also to be noted in the Morgan scenes. As for the animals, their human qualities are demanded in Bidpai illumination by the text, and even without such a motivation the animal world is generally sympathetically rendered in South Italian miniatures, except in conventionalized ornament. There is no cycle in Paris Ms ar. 3465 corresponding to that of the Morgan manuscript, the miniature for the fable of the king's son (fol. 141') simply showing four men in a row in long garments; those for the other fables necessarily have a different content, since they follow the usual Arabic form of the story as explained above. Some of the later manuscripts have more miniatures from the fable of the king's son; e.g., Paris Ms ar. 3475 (eighteenth century) shows the handsome man and his lady, the merchant's son bargaining, a parade of the king's son on an elephant, and two scenes of the courtier and the birds, similar in content to the two in the Morgan cycle but quite unlike them in composition.36 In short, none of these miniatures suggest an Arabic prototype for the Morgan cycle. Furthermore, Mrs. Husselman has suggested the following explanations for the distor- tions of the text of the Bidpai fables:"7 35. It is true that the Sasanian motive of the sacred tree was never as well established in Italian art as the similar Roman axial composition of birds or animals at either side of a vase filled with fruits, or with a flowering plant issuing from its mouth. As Christian art developed, the cross or monogram was often substituted for the vase, but the decorative value of the Roman motive was not forgotten, as the well-known eleventh-century transennae at Torcello bear witness (cf. P. Toesca, Storia dell'arte italiana, IIIs, 789). Another eleventh-century panel from San Marco, Venice, shows a combination of the sacred tree motive with the vase (ibid., 435). 36. Lack of knowledge on my part of the Arabic and Persian languages prevents me from attempting a dis- cussion of the Bidpai cycles, tempting as a study of them has proved to be. The literature of the subject, which has been greatly increased in recent years, has been listed by Kurt Holter (Die islamische Miniaturhandschriften vor 135o, Leipzig, 1937); a considerable supplement to this list by H. Buchthal, Otto Kurz, and R. Ettinghausen is soon to appear in Ars Islamica. For this reference I am indebted to Dr. Ettinghausen. 37. See her monograph, pp. 21-22.</page><page sequence="17">MINIATURES OF FABLES OF BIDPAI AND LIFE OF AESOP 113 I) The text ... is a Greek adaptation, rather than a translation, of certain stories in the Arabic version of the Kalilah and Dimnah. 2) The Arabic manuscript was of the most common type ... but it was defective when it came into the hands of the Greek adapter. 3) The Greek adapter misunderstood some portions of the text ... and was obliged to supply some details from his own imagination. He thus provided us with an apparently unique text of the Kalilah and Dimnah. It will be seen that while none of these explanations exclude the possibility that the original Arabic text was illustrated, they all require the conclusion that several of the Morgan miniatures must have been composed for the Greek translation or adaptation. An archetype, therefore, based on any one of these explanations, would necessarily have been made up partly of Arabic and partly of western miniatures; but in view of the consistency in style and treatment of the scenes in the Bidpai cycle, it would be difficult to accept such an archetype. I therefore have found it impossible to establish the probability of an Arabic archetype for the Bidpai scenes. The Aesop miniatures were certainly based on late classical formulas, of which the orans pose of the priestess of Isis (Fig. 23) is a familiar example.38 The resemblance noted above between this figure and the Virgo of the ninth-century manuscripts at St. Gall and Montecassino (both obviously late classical in derivation),39 while implying a connection between them as yet unexplained, gives some ground for the possibility of an archetype influenced by a Hellenistic illustrated manuscript of Aratus (fl. third century B.C.). That the Aesop miniatures were copied from an earlier cycle seems implicit in the unfilled spaces, and these indicate further that the Morgan scribe copied the exact pagination of his model, a conclusion corroborated by Professor Perry, reasoning from the treatment of a certain lacuna in the text.40 Whether the miniatures originated with the model or the model itself was a copy of earlier miniatures remains conjectural.41 38. The orans attitude, though best known in Early Christian usage, was an ancient pagan pose, whose place of origin and primitive significance is not clear. It must have been familiar to the common people of Greece as it occurs on small gravestones found in Attica, Asia Minor, and the islands, examples of which will be illustrated in a forth- coming book on the art of the people in Hellenistic and Early Roman times by Karl Lehmann-Hartleben of New York University. As a pagan prayer motive it appears on a gem with the words PROVIDENTIA DEORUM COSII, showing a female figure raising her arms toward the sun (cf. A. Conze, "Der betende Knabe," 7ahrbuch des kaiserlich deutschen archiiologischen Instituts, I, 1886, p. 12). An Etruscan example on a gold fibula in Providence has recently been published by George M. A. Hanfmann of Harvard ("The Etruscans and their Art," Bulletin of the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, xxviii, 1940, p. I1). A study of the sub- ject is promised by Mary B. Swindler of Bryn Mawr, who showed some of the more recently discovered examples at the annual meeting of the American Archaeological Insti- tute in Baltimore, December, 1940. (For a resum6 of her paper see American fournal of Archaeology, xLv, 1941, 87.) 39. See pp. o09-11o, note 29. 40. Perry, Studies in the Text History of the Life and Fables of Aesop, p. 8. 41. Conditions in Europe have prevented the search for illuminated Aesop manuscripts which I had hoped to make, but Professor Perry writes me as follows, "A fourteenth- century Life of Aesop in Moscow has a small miniature of Aesop (Cod. Mosquensis 436, fol. 439), showing him in a monkish robe of relatively modern appearance, with one hand in the palm of the other as if making a calculation; on his head is a tall turban with conspicuous and irregular spiral folds tapering off to a point at the top. No resem- blance to Morgan Ms 397. The codex came from Mt. Athos but there is some reason to believe that it may have been brought thither from Iberia (Georgia) or that part of the world. Apart from the Morgan manuscript this is the only Greek manuscript of the Life which has a picture of Aesop. I have seen all the manuscripts of the Life except seven or eight of its latest form and I have never heard of any other illustration in the Life or Fables of Aesop in Greek." Photographs of an eighteenth-century Georgian manuscript of the Life and Fables said to have been translated from the Greek, which have recently come into the possession of Professor Perry, show at the end of the Life a crude drawing of a man with distorted limbs apparently caught in a net, presumably a portrait of Aesop. The eleventh-century Latin manuscript of Aesop at Leyden has a conventional portrait at the beginning of a confused mass of illustrations of the Fables, showing the author seated in his house with none of the distortions ascribed to him in the texts (cf. Georg Thiele, Der illustrierte lateinische Aesop in der Hand- schrift des Adamar: Cod. Vossianus lat. oct. 15, fol. z95-20o5, Leyden, 1905). Nothing in existing Greek painting suggests that there was a cycle for the Life, nor even that Aesop was a popu- lar subject in early Greek art. The cup in the Museo Gre- goriana at Rome (E. Pfuhl, Malerei und Zeichnung der Griechen, uII, 182, fig. 495), showing Aesop (caricatured</page><page sequence="18">114 THE ART BULLETIN The figure style of the Bidpai cycle is farther removed from Hellenistic models than that of the Aesop scenes, and more consistently South Italian in its awkward but vivacious move- ment and expression, and in its over-large heads, hands, and eyes with their drooping lower lids.42 This difference in style can be understood if the archetype was composed for the Greek translation by a Latin miniaturist43 in a monastery located in the Campanian or Abruzzese region, such as Montecassino or S. Vincenzo al Volturno, or at Capua at the end of the ninth or early tenth century when the monks of both these monasteries were there. It can be supposed that an illustrated life of Aesop was available whose miniatures not only were incorporated into the text but provided a model for the style and composition of the Bidpai cycle. The Morgan miniatures would then be a copy produced by a Latin hand perhaps a hundred years later, in which the two styles were so blended as to provide a series of miniatures similar stylistically but preserving certain characteristics of the figure style of their prototypes.44 In conclusion, the Morgan miniatures appear to have been copied in the late tenth or early eleventh century, in a South Italian scriptorium, from a Greek folklore book contain- ing illustrations for a fragment of the Bidpai tales and a Life of Aesop, for which each cycle may have had a still earlier prototype. The archetype for the Bidpai miniatures may con- ceivably have been Arabic, but the archetype for the Aesop scenes was late classical. Al- though the text is written in Greek,45 the miniatures were copied by a Latin hand in the characteristic broken-down classical style of the Campania-Abruzzi region of South Italy. The work of the Latin miniaturist was interrupted after fol. 24r and never resumed. The location of the scriptorium remains unknown; the presence of the manuscript in Grottaferrata in the eighteenth century is not conclusive as to its provenance, since the library at Grottaferrata had been previously dispersed.46 But that it was located somewhere with an enormous head) and the fox, seems to be the one example recognized by writers on classical painting. (On Aesop in art, see Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopiidie, Stutt- gart, 1909, vi, cols. 1714-16.) The Elder Philostratus, how- ever, writing early in the third century A.D., lists, in his Ei~6veL, Aesop and a procession of his fables, along with scenes of playful child life. Dr. K. Lehmann-Hartleben, in an interesting and important article defending the validity of the descriptions of Philostratus (ART BULLETIN, XXIII, 1941, 16-44), throws a little doubt on this subject as being so loosely connected with the adjacent scenes as to permit one to "wonder whether it could have been inserted by Philostratus" (op. cit., p. 38). This seems an unnecessarily generous gesture on the part of Dr. Lehmann-Hartleben, since Aesop's fables appear to me to be quite felicitously connected with subjects of child play; but even if it is an insertion, it implies that Aesopica as a subject for painting was fairly familiar in the early third century A.D., i.e., shortly after the time when Professor Perry dates the arche- type of the Morgan text. 42. Cf. the miniatures in the Rule of St. Benedict (Monte- cassino MS 175) written at Capua by the Cassinese monks, 915-34 (The Exultet Rolls of South Italy, pl. cxcvi); also, the tenth-century Exultet Roll now at the John Rylands Library, Manchester, England (The Exultet Rolls... , pl. LII-Lv). A very early example of eyes with drooping lid, conventionalized for decoration, occurs in a letter O in a Cava manuscript (no. 2), written at Montecassino an. 779-97 (Fig. 39). Although this treatment of the eye is current elsewhere in pre-Carolingian illumination, it is peculiarly persistent in manuscripts in Beneventan script. It was conventionalized in the tenth century for the illumi- nation of Greek manuscripts written at Capua (Fig. 40), and it appears in a portrait head inclosed in the letter O, in one of the manuscripts written by St. Nilus still preserved at Grottaferrata (K. Weitzmann, Die byzantinische Buck- malerei des 9. und to. Jakrhunderts, Berlin, 1935, pl. xcIII, 604). 43. The manuscript has no decorative initials nor strips of ornament in the Greek manner (cf. Figs. 40, 41), but the effect of a frontispiece given to fol. Ir (Fig. i) perhaps indi- cates influence from Greek illumination. 44. I.e., the early tenth-century style of the Capuan region, for the prototype of the Bidpai cycle and a more Hellenistic style for the archetype of the Aesop scenes. The last scene (Fig. 25) by a later hand almost as unskilled as the one which worked over the twelfth-century addition to the Exultet Roll at Mirabella-Eclano (cf. The Exultet Rolls of South Italy, pl. Lx) is perhaps an original composition based on the Bidpai scenes, since the king sits on a seat whose back shows only one upright, like that of the Bidpai king (Fig. 4); the contour of the right side of the king's head and neck is similar to that of the Bidpai king (Fig. 8); and the tripartite crown and sceptre are later types of those of the Bidpai cycle. There is, however, nothing about the miniature which is inconsistent with later retouching by unskilled scribes such as often mars South Italian illu- mination. 45. The possibility that the Greek text might have been written by a Latin monk who knew Greek has been sug- gested, but Mrs. Kirsopp Lake points out that the Latin- isms which occur are not those characteristic of Latin scribes when writing Greek. 46. Cf. A. Rocchi, De coenobio cryptoferratensi eiusque biblioteca et codicibus praesertim graecis commentarii, Tus- culum, 1893, 269, 274-75, 280-84. The Morgan manuscript was seen at Grottaferrata in 1789 by P. Ramolino (Otto Crusius, Babrii fabulae Aesopeae, editio major, Leipzig, 1897, p. ix), but the lack of early catalogues makes it im-</page><page sequence="19">MINIATURES OF FABLES OF BIDPAI AND LIFE OF AESOP i i5 near the valley of the Volturno, where Campanian and Abruzzese influences mingled, seems assured in view of the implications of the miniature style. Such a location would be pro- vided at Valleluce, the monastery in the mountains between Montecassino and S. Vincenzo al Volturno, which was granted to the Calabrian St. Nilus by the abbot of Mon- tecassino, and to which St. Nilus brought his monks in the second half of the tenth century, establishing them there for fifteen years?.4 Later St. Nilus spent some time at Capua and Gaeta before founding the monastery at Grottaferrata in 1004. Dr. Kirsopp Lake has always insisted that the script had Calabrian characteristics. This would lend plausibility to a conjecture that this copy of a mutilated Greek folklore book was planned in one of the Campanian scriptoria of St. Nilus during the visit of a Latin miniaturist, who began to copy the miniatures but was called away before finishing his work; the text was then copied by resident Calabrian monks who left the spaces for illumination as they appeared in the archetype, hoping for a return of the artist-scribe. It is obvious that the known presence of the manuscript at Grottaferrata in the eighteenth century adds some weight to such a conjecture, since the codex might well have been brought there by St. Nilus or his monks and remained forgotten in some cupboard during the dispersion of the library. Whatever may be their history, the Morgan miniatures present themselves as additions to our scanty list of early South Italian miniatures, and the comparatively untouched con- dition of most of the Aesop scenes gives them some stylistic importance. They also offer some evidence for coSperation between Greek and Italian scribes and miniaturists and for their common interests and activities in South Italy in the early Middle Ages. In addition, they are themselves at present unique early illustrations of the Bidpai fables and the Vita Aesopi. Like editors of the texts, students of medieval illumination must hope for tht discovery of other examples, Greek or Arabic, to throw further light upon this importane collection of folk tales in early versions. WELLESLEY COLLEGE APPENDIX In examining the Morgan Bidpai cycle with Dr. Richard Ettinghausen, we became interested in noting elements which might be considered Persian, and he has listed those he recognized. He under- stands quite well that these elements appear also in western miniatures-some of them a common in- heritance from early archaic vase painting-but as his list brings into comparison several interesting ex- am ples, I give it below, at the same time pointing out that many of these so-called Sasanian features are shown in the few South Italian examples reproduced in Figs. 26-41. NOTE BY RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN: "The minia- tures in the Pierpont Morgan Library Ms 397 reveal only a few features which could be traced back to Iranian art. As Byzantine art contains throughout a certain amount of Iranian elements, we do not necessarily have to assume that there was a Persian prototype for Ms 397 which was directly copied or which formed the direct source of inspiration. A. The miniature on fol. 5v, (Fig. 13), "The Wolves Eat Figs," shows the following Iranian features: I) The typically Persian heraldic composition with two animals on either side of a tree, appearing in textiles, seals, and stuccoes, and becoming wide- spread through the diffusion of Persian silks. possible to know when it entered the library. Cf. N. B. Ieromonaco, "La biblioteca della badia greca di Grotta- ferrata," Accademie e biblioteche, vI, 2, 1930. The consider- able collection of manuscripts from Grottaferrata now at the Vatican was examined in the hope that some of their illumination might throw light on the Morgan miniatures, but the search produced no results. 47. Batiffol, in his L'abbaye de Rossano (Paris, 1891, Pref. p. xxi) places the monastery of S. Angelo at Valleluce "near Gaeta" and this location is given to it in the Catholic Encyclopedia (s.v. "Nilus"); but the records and tradi- tions at Montecassino leave no doubt that the site of the monastery given to St. Nilus was the little valley, where the name still lingers, about four kilometers from S. Elia on the river Rapido (cf. A. Caravita, I codici e le arti a Monte Cassino, Montecassino, 1869, I, 156). A visit to the region in search of some fragment of fresco or miniature which might support the possibility that the Morgan codex was produced there proved fruitless, nothing earlier than the thirteenth century being anywhere visible.</page><page sequence="20">116 THE ART BULLETIN 2) The raising of an animal's foreleg on the side away from the spectator (found also on fols. 4r, 4v, 5'). For parallels in Sasanian and medieval Islamic art objects, see J. Orbeli, "Sasanian and Early Islamic Metalwork," in Survey of Persian Art, New York and London, 1938, IV, pl. 135; A. U. Pope, "Ceramic Art in Islamic Times: A. The History," in Survey of Per- sian Art, 1938, v, pl. 575a, 583b, 596a, 616; Ralph Hariri, "Metalwork after the Early Islamic Period," in Survey of Persian Art, 1939, vI, p1. 1288a, i292a. 3) The inorganic application of flat cardboard-like front legs or wings to the animals' bodies somewhat in the manner of the application of limbs to a jump- ing-jack (seen also on fols. 2v, 3r, 4r, 5r, 5v, 6r, 6v). This tendency is foreshadowed in certain Sasanian works (see J. Orbeli-C. Trever, Orflvrerie sasanide [in Russian and French], Leningrad, 1935, pl. 4). It is quite apparent in Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pl. 29 (central bird), 31, 72; I. I. Smirnoff, Argenterie orientale, St. Petersburg, 1909, pl. LXx; P. Ackerman, "Textiles of the Islamic Period," in Survey of Persian Art, 1939, vI, pl. 981 (elephants, camels). 4) A well-padded animal foot, somewhat too large and long (also on fols. 4r, 4v, 5r, 6r), foreshadowed in such works as Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pl. 22, 30. See also Smirnoff, op. cit., pl. LVII; Survey of Persian Art, v, pl. 614a, 6I5a, 615b; E. Herzfeld, Die Malereien von Samarra, Berlin, 1927, fig. 38; P. Horn, "Sasanid- ische Gemmen aus dem British Museum," Zeit- schrift der Deutschen Morgenlindischen Gesellschaft, XLIV, 189o, pl. Ib, fourth row, no. 727a; pl. 2a, third row, no. 563. 5) Double line on lower part of animal's body to indicate its rotundity. See Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pls. 23, 24, 26, for possible earlier forms of this con- vention. 6) The telescopic arrangement which fits subse- quent parts of a tree trunk into each other as ob- served in certain grass species (schachtelhalmartig). See Smirnoff, op. cit., pl. LI; E. Herzfeld, Am Tor von Asien, Berlin, 1920, pl. xxxvIII. This is the common way of tree construction in late Sasanian art. 7) The lowest unit of the tree trunk with its two excrescences has its counterpart in A Survey of Per- sian Art, IV, pl. 177e; and in Horn, op. cit., pl. Ib, second row, no. 624. The same seal is also illustrated in E. Thomas, "Notes Introductory to Sassanian Mint Monograms and Gems," 7ournal of the Royal Asiatic Society, xIII, 1852, pl. III, 39. This particular seal in the British Museum shows also a vertical succession of small rectangular fields on the tree trunk which are similar to the vertical succession of small horizontal rectangles in Morgan Ms 397, fol. 5. 8) The floral forms superimposed on tree trunk. This feature might be a misunderstanding of a Sasanian iconographic feature which puts a tree on top of a scale-like hill symbol on which a floral form is drawn. It is possible that the tree in Morgan MS 397, fol. 5?, is a unification of a hill symbol showing a superimposed plant with a tree. For the Sasanian prototype, see Smirnoff, op. cit., pl. XLII (here the two animals seem to eat from the tree as in Morgan Ms 397, fol. 5'); Survey of Persian Art, Iv, pl. 177e. In some other instances a tree rises from a triangular- shaped root symbol covered on the sides by leaf forms. See E. Herzfeld, Am Tor von Asien, pl. XXXVIII, LIV. 9) Pointed cone-shaped leaves at the end of a branch. See Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pl. 27, 33, 52; Survey of Persian Art, Iv, pl. 229b. IO) There are no real parallels for the arrangement of the branches with leaves (or fruits) in the manner of spikes emanating from one central point. The closest parallel I found was Horn, op. cit., XLIV, pl. Ib, second row, no. 624; also H. H. von der Osten, "The Ancient Seals from the Near East in the Metro- politan Museum," ART BULLETIN, XIII, 1931, Seal no. Ioo. This particular seal in the Metropolitan Museum has three flowers emanating from one point. They are accompanied by little stems which have leaves in cross-bar shape, somewhat similar to the miniature on fol. 5v. B. Other Iranian features are perhaps: I) The sceptre of a floral nature in the hand of the king in the miniature on fol. 3v, which has many counterparts in old Persian and Islamic art. See O. M. Dalton, The Treasure of the Oxus, London, 1905, p. 92, no. 38 (where further references are given), pl. xII; von der Osten, op. cit., fig. 123; A. Pavlovskij, "Decoration des plafonds de la Chapelle Palatine," Byzantinische Zeitschrift, II, 1893, 380, 412. 2) Raising of the hands of the three companions on fols. Iv and 3V. This gesture might express only the conversation going on between the king and his com- panions, as in the miniatures on fols. 2r, 3r. In fols. Iv and 3v it is noticeable that the hands of the com- panions are raised much higher than that of the king. It may therefore be possible that it is a last remnant of the raising of the hand in supplication to a Persian king, as shown in two Sasanian rock carv- ings (see E. Herzfeld, "La sculpture rupestre de la Perse sassanide," Revue des arts asiatiques, v, 1928, pl. XLI, fig. 14; XLII, fig. 15; and in one wall painting from Qusayr'Amra (K. A. C. Creswell, Early Muslim Architecture, Oxford, 1932, I, 268-69, pl. 48). 3) The mustachioed lion. See Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pls. 26, 30. At least, anthropomorphic qualities are indicated in Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pl. 33." Dr. Ettinghausen also noticed the following Per- sian features, but did not consider them sufficiently characteristic to include them in the foregoing list: i) A figure with head seen in profile looking and pointing upward, and seated near to, or being part of, a decorative scheme, as on the Morgan miniature of fol. Ir. Cf. T. W. Arnold and A. Grohmann, The Islamic Book, London, 1929, pl. 3a. 2) The ending of the animal tail in a floral form as in fols. 4r, 5r, 6I. Cf. Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pl. 22; Survey of Persian Art, Iv, pl. 135. 3) Circular neck opening of coat like the one worn by the two courtiers, fols. I, 2r, 2v 3r 3v. Cf. Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pl. 13, 16, 19. 4) The tripartite crown. Cf. Orbeli-Trever, op. cit., pl. I, 2, 5, 6. It is interesting to observe that the only feature listed by Dr. Ettinghausen that was not part of common practice in South Italian painting in the eleventh century is the sacred tree motive of the fig- tree scene. If there was an Arabic archetype for the Morgan cycle, this scene must surely have been one of its miniatures.</page></plain_text>
