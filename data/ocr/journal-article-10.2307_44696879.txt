<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plate 1</page><page sequence="2">LEAGROS KALOS In 1920 Ernst Langlotz proposed a scheme for dating Greek vases in terms of absolute and not merely relative chronology. His monograph was entitled Zur Zeitbestimmung der strengrotfigurigen Vasenmalerei und der gleichzeitigen Plastik and was dedicated to his teacher Franz Studniczka. Studniczka's own essay, 'Zur Zeitbestimmung der Vasenmalerei mit roten Figuren'1 had itself represented a landmark in the chronological study of Greek vase painting. As Langlotz's title suggests, he thought it possible to derive a dating system for Greek vases based on stylistic comparisons between the medium of Greek vase-painting and that of sculpture.2 The Siphnian T reasury, the Marathon T umulus, and the Persian sack of Athens, however, provided the only supposedly fixed points in Langlotz's framework.3 He therefore sought other evidence which would link vase-painting to the known facts of Greek history and decided to develop Studniczka's investigation of the extent to which the subjects of Â:úf/os-inscriptions possessed an independent historical identity. In particular, Langlotz followed Studniczka in arguing that the evidence pertaining to Leagros, son of Glaukon, provided the key to a chronological scheme for the development of red-figured vase-painting.4 In 1831 K. O. Müller had already proposed such an approach and identified the Leagros of Greek vases as one of the butts of Plato Comicus' play, Laius, dating from the first decade of the fourth century.5 On the testimony of the Pseudo-Themistoclean Eighth Letter, 6 introduced into the debate by E. Katterfeld in 191 1 ,7 Langlotz claimed that Leagros was in the narrowest sense a contemporary of Themistocles as his auvs(pr|ßo(; and r|XiKicóxr|ç. Leagros would accordingly have been born in the mid-520s and become pais kalos c. 510-505 B.C.8 Langlotz therefore dated to these years the work of black- and red-figure vase-painters who celebrated Leagros: inter alios Euphronios, Euthymides, the Kiss Painter, Onesimos, and the Leagros Group.9 He thus considered the judgement of Studniczka and Furtwängler vindicated against attacks by Helbig, Klein and Hartwig during the intervening thirty years,10 and Langlotz himself was generally considered to have won the day. In 1936, B. D. Meritt expressed confidence that 'the span of his [sc. Leagros'] life is well-known'11 and, as R. M. Cook still wrote in 1972, 'Furtwängler's chronology of the archaic phase stood the test of Langlotz's thesis'.12 Indeed, with the sole exception of E. Löwy's criticisms,13 Langlotz's conclusions have remained unchallenged except in detail14 for more than half a century.15 We have argued elsewhere that the discrepancies which have become almost de</page><page sequence="3">98 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS rigueur in the study of Greek art are as unnecessary as they should be uncomfortable.16 We wonder, for example, if the sculptures from the Athenian Acropolis really belong to an earlier generation than the dedicatory bases on which they stood.17 The considerable discrepancy between the letter forms of vase- inscriptions and those on stone is not for us easily dismissed by the 'guess' that 'private inscriptions might be a generation or more ahead of the official script'.18 Pliny's testimony that Dipoenus and Scyllis (born around the 50th Olympiad) were 'the first to win fame as sculptors in marble' is rejected by G. M. A. Richter19 on the grounds that monumental Greek sculpture can be dated well before 580 B.C., but we do not share her confidence that the literary tradition is necessarily so 'confused' as she supposes.20 Scepticism regarding the usefulness or credibility of literary sources21 feeds attitudes of this kind. Herodotus, for example, has suffered an especially bad press amongst students of Greek art from the time that A. H. Sayce began to impugn the historian's veracity against the more favourable judgement of scholars like Petrie and Rawlinson.22 In our work on sixth century chronology, however, we have found that again and again the documentary record (and not least that of Herodotus) may coincide with, rather than contradict, the archaeological one.23 Such harmony, of course, must not be expected in every case, but where discrepancies do occur, they require more detailed reflection than they have customarily received. These judgements about chronology have an extraordinarily far-reaching effect on the interpretation of much of Greek art. A vase-painter's language, we are told - at least implicitly - is a hermetic one to the extent that it does not usually comment upon the world outside the artist's studio,24 and the way in which most classical archaeologists have come to discuss such matters creates the sense that the visual arts of ancient Greece are culturally autonomous. We believe this view to be mistaken. The purpose of our present article is to judge the extent to which Leagros - and other &amp;0/os-inscriptions on Attic vases are 'useful',25 or indeed even usable in reconstructing an absolute chronology for Greek vase-painting. There is other evidence besides that of the Pseudo-Themistoclean Letter which bears on the career of Leagros, son of Glaukon. Much of it has been discovered since Langlotz's monograph was published in 1920, and this evidence we shall now discuss. In 1934 a statue base dedicated by Leagros, son of Glaukon, to the Twelve Gods was discovered in situ beside their Altar in the Athenian Agora.26 B. D. Meritt dated the inscription to the decade 490-480 so that Leagros was assumed to have made the dedication in his adult life, not during his &amp;a/o5-period.27 Three years later, A. E. Raubitschek discussed the tondo of a cup by the Kiss Painter (then in Baltimore, but now in Oxford, Miss.).28 The tondo (Pl. I), with its scene of a bearded man wearing a garland and admiring the statue of a youthful athlete, is inscribed Aéaypoç KaXóç.29 Raubitschek interpreted the bearded man as 'Leagros... standing before the statue which he dedicated to the Twelve Gods'.30 G.</page><page sequence="4">LEAGROS KALOS 99 M. A. Richter had informed him that 'though stylistically the vase has been dated about 500 B.C., an absolute date as late as 490 B.C. would perhaps be possible if we suppose that the painter retained an old-fashioned style'.31 If these chronological conclusions are accepted and the victor base in the cup tondo is one and the same as the Leagros base at the Altar of the Twelve Gods, then we can only assume that Leagros made his dedication in 490 and that (pace M. Guarducci)32 the Kiss Painter's cup represents a contemporary record of that event. Such an assumption immediately gives rise to at least three questions: (1) Are the chronological conclusions correct? (2) Are the two victor bases one and the same? (3) Does the foj/os-inscription naming Leagros necessarily entitle us to assume that either of the two figures in the tondo represents, in J. K. Davies's terms, 'Leagros (I), son of Glaukon (I)'?33 We shall presently address these questions, but first we must point out an important corollary of Raubitschek's chronological assumption so far as it affects the meaning and use of kalos-names in Athenian vase-painting. Since that assumption implies a twenty year span (510-490 B.C.) for the period in which Leagros might be praised as kalos on Attic vases, the usefulness and precision of such evidence as a means of dating Greek vases is qualified; a similar problem is raised by Hippodamas' supposedly long kalos- period,34 or by acceptance of the view that Leagros continued 'to be acclaimed as "beautiful" for the best part of half a century'.35 Other evidence relevant to a reconstruction of Leagros' vita can be summarised as follows: (1) some 53 ostraca recently found in the Ceramicus excavations36 name Leagros as a candidate for ostracism. One of these ostraca is linked to the familiar names of Megacles, Themistocles, and Cimon on joining sherds from a calyx-crater by the Kleophrades Painter; (2) the name Leagros has been read on a choregic dedication originally dated c. 440;37 (3) the presence of Leagros as a general at Drabescus in the Thasian campaign of 465/4 is recorded in the texts of Herodotus (9.75) and Pausanias (1.29.5) and he is generally, but unwarrantably, assumed to have died at the Nine Ways in one of the many Athenian catastrophes at that site; (4) Leagros' son Glaukon (Glaukon II),38 was general at Samos in 441 /039 and so must have been alive by the close of the 470s. As we discuss these data relating to Leagros' life, we are concerned primarily to judge what can be known about the date of his birth and hence the period in which he could be called kalos in the traditional homo-erotic sense. While we shall try to avoid unwarranted scepticism about the information to be gleaned from these ancient sources, we recognise the wisdom of W. E. Thompson's caution that a multiplication of men named Leagros within this family [sc. the family of Glaukon] is to be expected, for whenever a Leagros had two or more children, male or female, he could expect to have two or more grandchildren named after him, and in addition many an Athenian must have been named after an uncle. Of course, it is the economical hypothesis to postulate only one</page><page sequence="5">100 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS Leagros [Thompson is referring to the family in the second half of the fifth century] but in Attic prosopography with a frequent repetition of names within a family the economical hypothesis sometimes is false economy.40 At the same time, however, we believe that Ockham's razor is a valid principle in prosopographical research and that persons should be multiplied only when necessity - and not merely fresh evidence of a previously attested name - arises. For example, we do not think it an appropriate response to Thompson's caution to follow Löwy in multiplying Leagroi in order to justify his theory about the relationship between the development of red-figured and Polygnotan painting.41 THE CERAMICUS OSTRACA During excavations in the Ceramicus in 1965 and 1966, a major find of ostraca came to light. These ostraca still await publication and until then, as D. M. Lewis has prudently observed, any conclusions drawn from them must at best be provisional.42 Even so, Lewis has argued convincingly against the hypothesis, so widely canvassed since their discovery, that the lower layer contains a dump of ostraca from 486 and perhaps 485. Lewis has shown that several of the Athenians mentioned on these sherds are 'plausible candidates for the 470's'.43 In fact, no unambiguous evidence has yet been published which requires the conclusion that any of the ostraca found in the Ceramicus deposit predates the Persian sack of Athens.44 There is consequently no reason at this stage of the Ceramicus publications to assume that any of the Leagros sherds predates the 470s. Lewis notes that to his knowledge there are at least three cases where Kimon and Megakles pieces join or come from the same pot. This suggests that at least a very fair proportion of the 490 Kimon ostraka from the deposit come from the same ostracism as those of Megakles. I do not think it possible that Kimon was voted against in quantity in 486, still less that if he was, he should have failed to appear in the closed Agora deposits.45 One of the pots in question on which the names of Cimon and Megacles are linked is a red-figured calyx-crater with a zone of black-figured palmettes below the rim on the outside. The vase is attributed to the Kleophrades Painter and has been dated to the decade 500-490.46 Megacles' name occurs three times, Cimon's, Themistocles', and Leagros' once each. If Leagros was born c. 525 and we admit Cimon (born c. 5 10) as a candidate for ostracism soon after his father's death, then the sherds conceivably date from an ostracism in the 480s. On the other hand, in the light of available evidence and from what D. M. Lewis has written of Cimon's candidacy,47 we think if safer to draw a provisional conclusion that the ostracism</page><page sequence="6">LEAGROS KALOS 101 dates from later in the next decade when Cimon's public career had become established. At any rate, the presence of Themistocles' name provides a terminus ante quem. A gossipy ostracon has also been reported which speaks of Leagros as a 'traitor, malignant and a slanderer',48 but we know neither what provoked the writer's offence - political hostility, homosexual pique, or some other cause - nor when the provocation occurred. We therefore conclude from this brief examination of the Leagros ostraca that they permit (though they obviously do not require) a birthdate for Leagros as late as 495 B.C. Though the early twenties might seem an early age to become a candidate for ostracism, we are encouraged by the fact that at present many students of ostracism evidently find no difficulty with their view that Cimon was a candidate at a similar age (viz., in 486). Moreover, Leagros' particular celebrity as kalos , not to mention his dedicatory base at the Altar of the Twelve Gods (on the assumption that its erection predated the Leagros-ostraca), could well have inspired (pôóvoç in some of his fellow-citizens.49 THE CHOREGIC DEDICATION {IG I3 958) In 1939, B. D. Meritt published a fragmentary inscription which had been discovered in the Agora in 1934.50 Meritt dated the inscription c. 440, defined it as a choregic dedication, and identified the choregos as Leagros, the grandson of Leagros (I).51 Davies resists Meritt's identification and instead interprets the evidence as follows: 'The most economical hypothesis is that the choregos, as Leagros (III), was a younger son of Leagros (I), born (say) in the 480s and given his father's name after a well-attested practice'.52 The editors of IG I3 now date the inscription 450-440, but agree with Meritt that it represents a choregic dedication. The putative grandfather of a Leagros old enough to be choregos c. 450, would obviously have been born in the sixth century. Moreover, it is by no means certain that if this 'choregic' Leagros was the younger brother of Glaukon (II) he would have been eligible to hold such a position in his brother's lifetime. (On this choregia, see further, pp. 109-10 below.) LEAGROS IN THRACE It is conceivable, however, that Leagros survived his tour of duty as general in Thrace and lived on to become the choregos of IG I3 958 (not to mention the 'impotent old man ... in extreme old age'53 of Plato's Laius54). While there seems to exist no reasonable doubt that Leagros served up north as a general in 465 /4, 55 the insistent report of modern scholarship that he met his death in those parts may be 'an exaggeration'. In order to demonstrate the likelihood that Leagros survived the</page><page sequence="7">102 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS Thracian campaign it will be necessary to examine in some detail the historical context in which that campaign occurred. By the mid-460s Cimon's prestige at Athens had reached the height from which it was so soon to fall. After winning his spurs at Eion Miltiades' son had inherited the mantle of Athenian leadership and inaugurated a new age of Thesean democracy at home and abroad.56 Some ten years after his initial success as a field general, with the revolt of Naxos quelled,57 and recently victorious at the Eurymedon, Cimon returned to the northern Aegean to reduce Thasos to the status of Athenian vassal. This action was motivated by the decision both to transfer 'key natural resources of the Aegean into Athenian hands'58 and also to proclaim the ineluctable will of Athenian hegemony. In the previous century, during their residence at Rhaecelus,59 Pisistratus and his sons had become acquainted with the mineral wealth to which the Parian colony of Thasos had access in the regions to the north and east of the Chalcidic peninsula. Pisistratus established a base close to the mouth of the Strymon before his return to Athens in the 540s, but had apparently not chosen to threaten the Thasians' mining rights or curtail their revenues. Some eighty years later, however, this was precisely Athens' aim. For Cimon to take charge of the expedition against Thasos was appropriate indeed: he was by now acknowledged beyond dispute as Athens' premier naval commander and it was the Athenian settlement for which his own seizure of Eion opened the way that had both encroached upon Thasian mining interests in the southern marches of Mt Pangaeus and interfered with their access to colonial outlets on the coast.60 Thasos had also doubtless learned of Athenian plans to establish a colony at the Nine Ways as an effective centre for gaining control of the rich mineral deposits inland and rechannelling their distribution down the Strymon and through the fort at Eion to the Aegean sea-routes beyond. The Nine Ways, later known as Amphipolis, owed its strategic strength to its natural setting within the protective embrace of a horse-shoe bend in the course of the Strymon.61 The name of the Nine Ways well reflects its axial position in the road system which radiated into the heart of the mining districts throughout the region.62 It was here that Xerxes' engineers had performed one of their three major structural feats to prepare the way for his advance against Greece.63 As E. M. Walker has observed, 'the site commanded not only the sole line of communication between Chalcidice and the Thracian coast east of the Strymon, but also the only route practicable by land between the Hellespont and Greece'.64 The colony was projected 'on the largest scale known to the practice of the Greeks'65 - perhaps in part as a means of relieving the overpopulation which must have undoubtedly resulted from the events described in Ath. Pol. 24.1 - and the time taken to assemble so substantial an expedition would have necessarily given the Thasians some advance warning of Athens' intentions. This attempt to appropriate the mineral wealth of Thrace was given an aura of legitimacy by the fact that the new colony was planned as a concerted undertaking on the part of the</page><page sequence="8">LEAGROS KALOS 103 Delian Alliance.66 The Thasians had presumably responded to these circumstances by voicing their differences,67 and talk of revolt in Thasos68 gave the Athenians whatever pretext they might have still thought expedient for launching the full authority of the Alliance to repress Thasos' secession, an event the Athenians themselves had provoked. Thanks not least to the size and effectiveness of its fleet, Thasos resisted Cimon's blockade for over two years before finally capitulating under terms of surrender sufficiently harsh to justify the expense of Athenian effort (and perhaps, from Cimon's standpoint, to divert attention from charges, not least of bribery, brewing against him in Athens: see next para.). In addition to the assessment of tribute Thasos paid a war indemnity. She was moreover forced to ensure her future defencelessness by razing her fortifications, and her isolation by giving up her fleet. As a further condition of surrender, the Thasians lost their mainland colonies along with all their rights to the mineral deposits and the revenues they had derived from them. Terms such as these were undoubtedly motivated in part by Athenian 'self- interest'69 and the honour of the Athenian upper class who 'could hope not just to recoup their position in Athens which had been badly battered in the political agitations of the 480s, but also to gain a level of power and prestige unattainable in a purely Athenian context'.70 More than that, however, they acted no longer 'under fear',71 but their ruthlessness was designed as a deterrent to intimidate other economically or strategically powerful allies from contemplating a similar strike for independence. Small wonder that Stesimbrotus of Thasos so detested Cimon and all works of Athenian imperialism72 even if the art of his compatriot, Polygnotus, was so glorious an instrument of its celebration.73 If Cimon, however, had aspired to crown his earlier glory at Eion by reducing Thasos, appropriating her economy and indirectly avenging his father's Parian débàcle , then he must have been sadly disappointed by the outcome. Thasos fell, but Athens meanwhile had suffered a calamity which set in motion events from which Cimon's career never fully recovered, for Thasos lost only by surrender what Athens had tried, but failed, to achieve by more direct intervention. Long before Thasian resistance had collapsed, the simultaneous attempt to colonise the Nine Ways ended in disaster and feelings ran so high that at his trial Cimon was alleged to have sabotaged the whole enterprise in exchange for a bribe.74 His punishment was set at a fine of fifty talents, reminiscent of his father's before him (and of Demosthenes' report,75 whatever its validity - H. T. Wade-Gery denies it any76 - that Cimon's brother-in-law Callias Lakkoploutos was likewise fined fifty talents for bribery on his return from negotiating the Peace in the late 460s).77 Cimon, however, suffered a double indemnity, since this trial gave the son of his father's prosecutor Xanthippus his first distinction in Athenian politics, for it was Pericles who successfully prosecuted Cimon's alleged venality.78 Memory of the fact that Thasos had sought Spartan aid during the Athenian blockade and that such aid would apparently have been forthcoming were it not for the Helot Revolt cannot</page><page sequence="9">104 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS have been forgotten when the philolaconian Cimon pleaded, with all the force of a double metaphor, that Greece should not be allowed to go lame, and that Athens should not consent to lose her yoke- fellow. The result of this memorable debate furnished fresh evidence that the ascendancy of Cimon was still unshaken [or, at least, not extensively so]. The Assembly voted a force of 4000 hoplites, under the command of Cimon.79 Cimon's mission, however, failed and, with his dismissal from Ithome, Cimon's legal defeat at the hands of Ephialtes and Pericles was capped by their political victory over the now discredited hero of Eurymedon. In 465, the potential colonists of the Nine Ways had been led en masse up the Strymon by two generals who, in their different spheres, had achieved considerable acclaim in Athenian life, Sophanes and Leagros. Sophanes, the survivor of manya fight to the death, finally met his end in Thrace,80 but Herodotus, contrary to widespread assertion, offers no authority for the view that Leagros 'died at Drabescus'.81 As J. Kleine has correctly argued, Herodotus records only the death of Sophanes, but not that of Leagros who is mentioned simply as Sophanes' fellow (and probably superior) general.82 Thus, according to Herodotus,83 Sophanes 'was slain by the Edonians while serving as general with' (or, more likely 'under the superior command of)84 'Leagros'. On the other hand, as Kleine observes,85 it does not necessarily follow from Herodotus' report of Sophanes' death that Leagros was also slain. Thucydides' two accounts of the Cimonian campaigns against Thasos and the Thracian mainland are brief,86 and the second is even briefer than the first. While an inference that the whole colonial expedition was destroyed at Drabescus might be reasonably drawn from Thucydides' wording at 4. 102.2, this second mention of the Athenian catastrophe is best interpreted as merely an elliptical version of the first and any conclusions regarding wholesale massacre should therefore be argued on the basis of the earlier passage. Thucydides was thoroughly acquainted with the Thracian area both by personal background and military experience87 and was doubtless keenly aware of the irony that it held no more promise of good military fortune for Cimon's kin (but Pericles' partisan) than it had for Cimon himself. In his laconic narrative,88 however, Thucydides offers no basis for the modern view that Leagros died in Thrace; in fact he mentions Leagros in his Histories only as the father of Glaukon, general at Corcyra in 443 /2.89 Once the Athenian colonists had successfully 'gained control' (sKpdiTļaav)90 of the Nine Ways, previously occupied by the Edonians, an expeditionary force went further into the hinterland and 'was destroyed at Drabescus' (Si8(p0dprļaav èv Apaßricncd)).91 Drabescus was situated beside the river Angites, a navigable tributary of the Strymon and relatively close to the gold mines of Asyla92 which, in the fifth century, supplied Thasos' coastal outlets and, later in their history, an annual yield of one thousand talents of gold to Philip of Macedón.93 Moreover, Appian mentions the proximity of these mines to Philippi, olim Datus.94</page><page sequence="10">LEAGROS KALOS 105 Herodotus had in fact named Datus, and not Drabescus, as the place where Sophanes had fallen and Macan accounts for this apparent topographical discrepancy by supposing that 'Hdt. names the region and Thuc. the exact scene, or the township nearest to the scene, of the disaster'.95 Gomme, however, inclines to the view that 'Sophanes was not killed in this battle [sc. of Drabescus], but a little earlier or later in a fight more closely associated with the mines',96 while E. M. Walker thought that 'Thucydides is perhaps correcting Herodotus',97 presumably on the basis of his greater familiarity with the area. Nevertheless, the Athenians plainly appear to have regarded as their goal the gold mines at Asyla which, like those of Mt Pangaeus,98 may have been worked by various Thracian tribes, a fact which in part explains their reportedly united participation in the massacre ([01 'AGrļvaioi] biecpGdptļaav ... òtcò t&lt;öv 0pętKć5v popírá via) v). 99 To them the Athenian attempt to establish a settlement in the territory - Thucydides, as Cobet rightly saw, is not referring to the Nine Ways, but to the x^piov of Drabescus which included the Asyla mines - constituted an 'act of war'. 100 This Edonian enmity is still reflected some forty years later when a similarly united Thracian front fought with Brasidas against the Athenians, the Thracians as mercenaries, but the Edonians as willing and unpaid allies.101 Whatever the precise location of Sophanes' demise, it seems probable not only that he was the leader of the expeditionary force, but also that this contingent comprised only a fraction of the original ten thousand colonisers for it would be absurd102 to suppose that the whole body of settlers marched farther into Thrace; the majority would stay at Ennea Hodoi and begin the settlement: only some of the armed forces went farther, presumably to forestall an attack [or, as we have suggested, to establish an advance camp up the Angites, close to the Asyla mines, but with easy access to the main centre at Ennea Hodoi downstream]. The whole colony was destroyed as a result of the defeat, that is, the settlers were withdrawn; but that is another matter.103 By this statement Gomme implicitly (and in our view correctly) rules out the possibility that Thucydides' abbreviated recapitulation of these events at 4.102.2 should be interpreted as evidence for the massacre of all ten thousand stoikoi at Drabescus. We therefore do not believe that support exists for his assumption that the expeditionary force was led by both Sophanes and Leagros. Simply because Sophanes' generalship may have been subordinate to that of Leagros (if that, as Pausanias apparently believed, is what Herodotus' dpa implies; cf. Aéaypoç &amp; [láX loia è7i8T8Tpa7iTo f| Sóvapiç)104 or because Sophanes and Leagros served together in Thrace, we are not therefore entitled to assume that both generals were among those who went forth (Trpoe^Góvxeç)105 from the Nine Ways: 'aus dieser Angabe den Tod des Leagros herauszulesen, heisst einen Analogieschluss ziehen: wenn Sophanes gefallen ist, so gilt das auch für Leagros, den Mitstrategen'.106 The 'absurdity' of the usual view that 'the whole body of settlers advanced [from</page><page sequence="11">106 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS Ennea Hodoi] into the interior of the country'107 should be self-evident. The position at the Nine Ways, as we have described it, was of such economic and strategic importance that it would not have been voluntarily abandoned so soon after its capture or, for that matter, at any time the Athenians wanted to continue to exploit the mines inland. At the time of which we speak, the newly dispossessed Edoni would have promptly reoccupied the abandoned settlement. By doing so they would not only have cut off the Greek rear by isolating the expeditionary force from contact with Eion, but also made it impossible for the colonists, had they been successful in gaining a hold at Drabescus, to ferry the Asyla gold and other minerals from the Angites down the Strymon past the Nine Ways to Eion and the sea. One purpose in dispatching so large a group of colonists must have been to secure the passage of the Nine Ways and thereby manage the transport of Thracian wealth to the coast by the river route rather than overland where Thracians (not to mention Thasians) might - and in the event did - pose real dangers. We think it impossible that the Nine Ways would have been left unprotected or that its settlement would not have been directed by an Athenian of official standing. The failure inland not only threatened the new colony and, for the moment, removed its economic point, but also may well have caused a failure of nerve on the part of the resident commander. It may thus have been the case that Sophanes, with his superior military reputation, was the general active in the field while Leagros stayed behind at the Nine Ways as the commander and brilliant young figurehead of the new settlement. With the disaster at Drabescus, the expedition as a whole suffered considerable losses108 and the colonists accordingly abandoned Thrace in disarray and no doubt with tales to tell in Athens. Leagros may have retired into private life, displeased with his brief taste of foreign service. If Cimon had been his political patron, then his star was in any case likely to have fallen along with Cimon's as a consequence of both the whole Thasian affair and internal developments in Athenian domestic politics to which we have already alluded. Perhaps the gossipy ostracon (p. 101 above) which pillories Leagros for 'treachery' may be tentatively assigned to the political furore that followed the whole Thasian and Thracian campaign, for similar charges were brought against Cimon himself (p. 103 above). It is also tempting to associate the fact that the dead were apparently buried in the Ceramicus109 with Acamantid Leagros' participation in the Thracian disaster. Since Leagros was a resident of the Ceramicus, the dead might have been interred there either because Leagros was himself among them or out of some sense of responsibility to those who had lost their lives under his command. The tradition of Leagros as commander-in-chief of the Thracian expedition may reflect the need for him to assume charge of the settlers once Sophanes had died. It is at any rate mistaken to cite Pausanias' description of that burial as evidence that Leagros was indeed one of the dead. Pausanias does not claim to be reading the names of Sophanes and Leagros from the commemorative stele , but merely</page><page sequence="12">LEAGROS KALOS 107 appends to his account of the grave the comment that these two men had been generals on the campaign from which the casualties had been buried (or at least recorded) 'beside the road to the Academy'. As Kleine remarks,110 the antiquarian evidently relied closely on Herodotus for his information and seems in fact to have composed this entire passage with the historian's text 'vor Augen'. Reconstruction of these events is further confused by the manuscript readings of a scholion to Aeschines 2.31 which catalogues Athenian disasters (aToxqpaTa) at the Nine Ways, but again does not111 document Leagros' 'death at Drabeskos'. The scholion mentions the cleruchs led by Leogoras in the archonship of Lysicrates (i.e. 453/2 B.C.). Most scholars have, however, followed H. F. Clinton112 in emending the name of Leogoras, transmitted by the MSS, to Leagros and that of Lysicrates to Lysitheus, archon in 465/4, 113 but, in terms of what we know of fifth-century Athenian prosopography, such emendation is dangerous.114 In any case the scholion allows us to infer no more than that an attempt to establish a 'cleruchy' at the Nine Ways failed regardless of the identity of its leader. It does not report or even imply that 'Leagros died at Drabescus'. Perhaps both Leagros, son of Glaukon, and Leogoras led unsuccessful campaigns to the Nine Ways, perhaps scholars who have emended the scholion to Aeschines have been correct in their judgement, or perhaps it is Herodotus who confused a Leogoras active as a general in 453/2 with the more celebrated Leagros and Pausanias followed him in this error. Such uncertainties are all too characteristic of the record of the Pentecontaetia and in any case do not bear decisively upon the date of Leagros' birth, except to identify 495 B.C. tentatively as a terminus ante quem.115 Kleine has reasonably observed that, according to the conventional view of Leagros' birthdate, Leagros would have already been sixty or in his very late fifties by the time he sailed off to Thrace: ist ein Alter für dieses Amt von 60 Jahren zwar nicht ausgeschlossen - die militärische Dienstpflicht endete normalerweise mit dem 60. Lebensjahr - so ist aber doch wahrscheinlicher, dass Leagros zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch jünger war.116 Kleine, however, is not contemplating so radical a chronological revision as we are. Against our hypothesis it might be objected that Leagros in his early thirties was too young to hold a generalship, especially if he was the senior general in command over the head of the seasoned veteran Sophanes, son of Eutychides of Decelea. On the other hand, we know that thirty was the minimum age for election to the strategia and the fasti of the generalship in the fifth century117 are insufficiently detailed to permit firm conclusions about any prejudice which might have existed against early election to the office. Cimon certainly held senior military command in his early thirties1 18 and later in the century Alcibíades became general at (or close to) the minimum age.119 Moreover, in discussing Alcibíades' position in Athens, Thucydides makes the telling point that his youth was not the encumbrance it</page><page sequence="13">108 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS would have been elsewhere, but that he was held in public esteem on account of his family's reputation.120 Of Leagros' family less is known, but his merits plainly brought him some personal reputation. The dedication of the Altar of the Twelve Gods, not to mention the &amp;a/os-inscriptions, speaks of his public recognition and (assuming he did not merely succeed Sophanes after the latter's death, p. 104 above) we know of no reason why he could not have served in chief command of the colonists with the more experienced Sophanes in a subordinate position; the military relationship of Cimon and Aristides may not have been dissimilar. Indeed, with Cimon in general command of the Thasian campaign, it is wholly understandable if he chose to try out a newly eligible young man for the senior generalship in a region not very far from Eion where in the previous decade Cimon himself had enjoyed his own first independent military triumph. The promotion of Leagros might have commended itself to Cimon's own shrewd sense of political expediency121 on account of the young man's social prominence and probable connections. From a strategical standpoint, Cimon might even have felt more comfortable appointing a junior man to the post while Sophanes' military experience and reputedly awesome fighting qualities122 would have nicely counterbalanced Leagros' relative inexperience and youth. The Periclean general Hagnon, who later succeeded in establishing the settlement of Amphipolis on the site of the Nine Ways, was in fact credited with the opinion that granting younger men early experience in command may offer real advantages.123 It is perhaps tempting to speculate that he might have had his colleague Glaukon, son of Leagros in mind and it is to the vita of this Glaukon we now turn. GLAUKON, SON OF LEAGROS Glaukon (II) is the only son of Leagros (I) 'certainly filiated to him'. 124 According to J. K. Davies, Glaukon 'seems to have been born c. 490, when Leagros was about 35', but there is no non-ceramic evidence which requires this hypothesis. Glaukon was general at Samos in 441/40, and he was general again in 439/8, and at Corcyra in 433 /2. 125 The evidence of Glaukon's military service therefore provides a terminus ante quem of 471 for his birth if once again we admit the possibility of Glaukon's investiture as general at the minimum age. We have already discussed such a possibility in connection with his father Leagros and mentioned the remarks attributed to Glaukon's colleague Hagnon on the subject of youthful generals (last para.). Kleine126 has criticised the conventional date of Leagros' birth on the grounds that he is unlikely to have assumed a generalship in his 60th year, the last year for which an Athenian was eligible for that office. Davies observes that Glaukon's marriage to a daughter of Teisandros (II) 'must have occurred fairly late in his life',127 and that his three recorded generalships were all served during his</page><page sequence="14">LEAGROS KALOS 109 fifties. While there is nothing intrinsically implausible about such events in Glaukon's personal and public career, it may be that they result from the hypotheses of students of Greek art rather than reflect the historical facts of Glaukon's life. On the other hand, the ceramic evidence which refers to Glaukon (II), even if it does not necessarily prove that Glaukon was in fact already pais kalos at our hypothetical terminus, cannot be simply dismissed without any discussion. Glaukon, son of Leagros is celebrated as kalos on early classical red-figured vases128 and therefore seems to have inherited either physically or at least by family association the attributes of his father, a case of 'like father, like son'. As Davies acknowledges, Glaukon's putative birthdate c. 490 'emerges from his own frequent commemoration as kalos (A RV2 1580 f. [cf. Paral 506]) in the decade 475-465'. 129 Glaukon's vita is therefore thought to depend on the combination of the Langlotzian chronology of Greek vase-painting with the evidence for his strategic career. Langlotz's chronology, however, itself depends in large measure on his assumptions about the life of Glaukon's father. If Leagros' own birthdate can be lowered from c. 525 to c. 495 - and so far in our argument, pending full discussion of the Leagros base and the Kiss Painter's cup (see below, pp. 1 18-22), we have found no epigraphic or documentary evidence which prevents such a hypothesis - then the date of the vase-painting associated with his kalos-period and the whole sequence of Attic pottery to which it belongs may require a corresponding revision. (Other issues must be considered before such a revision can be fully achieved, but, as we have already mentioned, we are discussing elsewhere associated criteria on which the chronology of Greek art depends. The conclusions we have drawn from these studies, however, agree with the consequences of lowering Leagros' birthdate from the sixth to the fifth century.) The vases celebrating Glaukon as kalos therefore need not contradict the hypothesis allowed by his generalship, namely, that Glaukon was born in the mid- to late 470s. These vases could then be dated, roughly speaking, c. 460 to the mid/ late 450s. Davies attributes the acclamation of Glaukon as kalos on the Nolan amphora which also depicts a tripod on a base inscribed AKAM ANTU ENIKA OYAE (Fig. I)130 to Glaukon (II),131 and suggests that Glaukon has himself achieved the victory which the vase commemorates. This victory was either 'as choregos in dithyramb or as gymnasiarch'.132 The decorative and inscriptional evidence of the vase points more immediately to a choregic rather than a gymnasiarchal victory, but according to the terms of either Davies' judgement regarding Glaukon's birthdate ( c . 490) or the possible terminus ante quern of 47 1 , difficulties arise when one tries to associate Glaukon kalos with Glaukon choregos . If, for example, Glaukon was born c. 47 1 he might have been kalos in the 450s, but he was surely too young to have served as choregos. On the other hand, if Glaukon had been born c. 490, he would have been of an age to undertake a choregia but no longer, strictly speaking, kalos except perhaps in the sense of Miltiades kalos on the Oxford plate (on which, however, see p. Ill below). Indeed, the fact that Glaukon is acclaimed as kalos does not</page><page sequence="15">110 E D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICK.ERS JV A AA A /V T / ¿ ĶNI* A QVL£ ■ rAAN/kA/VKAAO^ ■ Fig. I necessarily associate him with the subject-matter of the vase, though as Panofka already perceived in 1850, the objects of such acclamation are often part of a vase's figurai decoration.133 Nevertheless, Glaukon's acclamation as kalos does not require us to assume that he was the victorious choregos and, if his father Leagros were still alive (pp. 106-7) it is unlikely that the son would have performed this office. Leagros himself, however, might conceivably have been the choregic patron of this Acamantid victory, and it may be significant for the dating of the Nolan amphora in question that its inscriptions include both a three- and a four-bar sigma in Akamantis and kalos respectively. While we have no wish to become embroiled in controversies about the introduction of the four-bar sigma into Attic epigraphy, the epigraphic inconsistency in these letter forms considered in combination with the plausible estimate of the production date of the vase allows us to assign it to the</page><page sequence="16">LEAGROS KALOS 111 period of the mid- to late 450s. May not this Acamantid victory then be the one and the same as the choregic victory commemorated by the Acamantid dedication we have already discussed (see p. 101 above)? If so, the Acamantids, and the family of Leagros in particular, have two grounds for celebration: Leagros has won a choregic victory, and Glaukon, like his father before him, is kalos. While the language and iconography of official dedications (such as the reference to the victory of the Acamantid tribe on our vase) may differ from that of vase-painting so that Glaukon's acclamation and the tribal victory need not be directly associated, the possibility remains - and remains unprovable - that Glaukon actually had a hand in the dramatic performance, or perhaps gained some athletic victory at about the same time. At any rate, while we date the amphora to the 450s, and not with Davies 'in the 460s, very soon after his father's death',134 we agree with his speculation about the 'frequent appearances' of both father and son as kaloi: 'one cannot help wondering whether the family's residence in Kerameis in 508 and presumably afterwards may not have had something to do with the potters' repeated commemoration of Leagros and of his son'.135 MILTIADES AND STESAGORAS Nevertheless, even if 'the repeated acclamation of named persons and the echo of ancient gossip which comes to our ears ... should ... tell us what it felt like to be a handsome boy in ancient Athens',136 we remain much more sceptical than Langlotz and those who accept his views about the validity of such acclamations in fixing the absolute chronology of Greek vase-painting (cf. p. 97 above). As Dover also acknowledges, 'there is no single and simple explanation of the &amp;fl/as-inscriptions which will account for all the data'.137 For example, Miltiades of Marathonian fame was almost certainly born by 550, 138 but by the time Paseas named a Miltiades as kalos on the red-figured plate in Oxford,139 'he [sc. Miltiades (IV)] was no longer a youth',140 even in terms of the conventional chronology of vase-painting according to which Paseas floruit c. 520- 510. H. T. Wade-Gery therefore suggested that 'the young archer perhaps is saying that Miltiades is a fine chap'. 141 On the other hand, if Leagros was born in 495 or not much earlier, the Oxford plate ceteris paribus might be reassigned to a Marathonian context (unless, of course, Paseas is referring to another, youthful Miltiades about whom we remain uninformed).142 J. K. Davies compares this apparent characterisation of Miltiades (IV) as kalos in his maturity with the evidence of 'two early Rf. cups (AR V2 179 top and 1609, no. 2), one of which recalls the Salting Painter and is datable 525-510'. These cups record a Stesagoras as kalos.143 In Davies' view, this Stesagoras is Stesagoras (II), the older brother of Miltiades (IV) who, following Stesagoras' death c. 5 16-5 15, 144 succeeded him in the Chersonnese. Davies remarks the coincidence that both</page><page sequence="17">112 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS brothers seem to be 'named as kaloi at about the same time (520-5 10), when both of them were well past their adolescence and young manhood. The two characteristics ... must be connected in some way, but we still know too little about kalos- naming to be able to guess usefully'.145 If Davies' assumption that Stesagoras kalos praises Stesagoras (II) is correct, then this evidence would support more powerfully than any other the current chronology of Greek vase-painting on account of the terminus ante quem provided by his death.146 Langlotz was unable to advance this argument himself because he believed that the material evidence post-dated 500. 147 He suggested instead that the vase-painters' Stesagoras was possibly the son of Miltiades by his Athenian wife.148 The identification which Davies suggested depends entirely for its point on the conventional chronology of the red-figured vases in question. Whether or not Langlotz's view of a Stesagoras, son of Miltiades (IV) is valid, there does exist a documented Stesagoras (III), father of Miltiades (VI) 'mentioned in, and possibly the eponym of, Aischines' Socratic dialogue Miltiades (F 37 Dittmar), ... and an approximate contemporary of Socrates'.149 If Leagros was born c. 495 or shortly before, and the chronology of red-figured vase-painting is revised accordingly, then it would be reasonable enough to suppose that the father of 'an approximate contemporary of Socrates' could have been born c. 500 and celebrated as kalos in the 480s on the vases mentioned by Davies.150 Before we leave the subject of Stesagoras (III), however, we must briefly discuss Cornelius Nepos' claim that a brother of Miltiades (IV) (whose name, either in whole or in part, is Sagoras) defended Miltiades at his trial in 489. We agree with Davies that this Sagoras can be neither Stesagoras (II) nor Stesagoras (III).151 Instead, we suggest that one of the (piXoi152 who came to Miltiades' defence was the Isagoras who had been the opponent of Clisthenes in 508. 153 Factionalism among the aristocratic families of Athens, not least between Alcmaeonids and Philaids, is part of the history of sixth-century Athens and - unless Bicknell is correct in his apparent view that Isagoras never returned to Athens after his flight in 507/ 6 154 - it would be hardly surprising if Clisthenes' rival of 508 took the part of a man accused by Xanthippus, an Alcmaeonid by marriage. Recent controversies regarding the putative Philaid ancestry of Isagoras155 do not vitiate this proposal. In fact, Isagoras' defence, motivated by whatever cause, may have been so heatedly loyal that the tradition of consanguinity - whether Philaid or fraternal - arose as a result. We therefore conclude, pace P. K. Marshall who prefers the conjectural Stesagoras,156 that Isagoras (attested by some manuscripts, albeit 'deteriores' [Malcovati, Winstedt]) should be restored as the correct reading at Nepos Milt. 7.6.157 ********</page><page sequence="18">LEAGROS KALOS 113 We have now mentioned all the material and documentary evidence necessary for an evaluation of Leagros' birthdate and so far have found nothing besides the Pseudo-Themistoclean Letter that argues against a terminus ante quem c. 495. We do not claim that the evidence requires this late date, but are content to have shown that it permits the possibility of so great a chronological variance. The variance seems to us substantial enough to neutralise the value of using &amp;a/os-inscriptions which acclaim Leagros to reconstruct an absolute chronology for Attic vase- painting. As G. M. A. Richter wisely observed, 'the information is often inconclusive, and we must be careful not to draw undue inferences'. 158 Miss Richter herself, however, provides an example of such an 'undue inference' by declaring a few pages earlier that 'Leagros and his son Glaukon ... give landmarks for the vases of about 510-505 and 470'.159 MILETUS Miss Richter's assertion might carry more weight if any confidence could be placed in Langlotz's report that a black-figured cup inscribed Leagros kalos and found in Miletus 'confirms' that vase-painters were already acclaiming his beauty before 494 B.C.160 There is, however, no reported evidence which clearly associates this sherd with the actual Persian sack of Miletus in 494 and since, at least from a material standpoint, the city recovered swiftly from the atrocities committed against it, we need not assume that the cup in question reached Miletus prior to its revitalisation c. 479. A. von Gerkan himself noted the impossibility of stratifying most of the finds on Kalabaktepe at Miletus where the Leagros cup was discovered,161 and we agree with E. Löwy's conclusion that 'eine Bestätigung der herrschenden Vasenchronologie lässt sich von Milet aus vorerst nicht gewinnen'.162 THE LEAGROS BASE We now return to the archaeological evidence of the Leagros base and the Kiss Painter's cup, and to the three questions which we raised in that connection, but did not answer (p. 99 above). We begin with the Leagros base (Fig. 2). Its dedication reads as follows: [AJéaypoç : àvé0£Ksv : TXaÓKovoç | Sóôekoi Gsoìaiv 'Leagros, son of Glaukon dedicated [this] to the Twelve Gods'. The inscription, however, does not record the nature of the statue thus dedicated. A specific divinity is not likely to have belonged in such a context. A Nike dedication is probably excluded, since Nikai in archaic Greek sculpture are usually shown running, and in early classical alighting with their feet together. The feet emplacements on the</page><page sequence="19">1 14 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS Fig. II Leagros base, however, with the right one slightly forward of the left call for a standing figure, and the only plausible alternative to a Nike is that the statue of an athletic victor stood on the base.163 If the victor were other than Leagros, the inscription would presumably have recorded that fact. Since it does not, we conclude that the statue was of Leagros himself. The fact that the dedication mentions no victory does not detract from the possibility that Leagros has indeed won one. Raubitschek discusses 'the same omission' in two other Athenian victor monuments: We may assume either that such omission was customary at this early time or, as is probable, that the statue itself sufficiently indicated the purpose of the dedication. This interpretation is certainly right for the statue of Epicharinos and for the statue set up by Gelon, and it can also be applied ... to the statue of Leagros.164 There is ample record from many Greek cities that such statues were erected to honour athletic victors.165 Raubitschek discusses several other victor statues at Athens and concludes that 'almost all of the victor monuments which we have listed ... were dedicated by men who took active part in political life'.166 He is led to this conclusion in part by a misunderstanding of a passage from Lycurgus167 which, so he claims, reports that 'there were no victor statues in the Agora of Athens'.168</page><page sequence="20">LEAGROS KALOS 115 Lycurgus, however, makes no such statement. He is praising the Athenians for the fact that they alone of the Greeks know how to honour worthy men, since in their Agora the Athenians have erected statues both of generals and the Tyrannicides while the agoras of other cities are filled with statues set up for athletes. Lycurgus does not say that monuments to athletic victors are excluded from the Athenian Agora, merely that they are not the only sculptural fare. We therefore do not think that Lycurgus' testimony contradicts the hypothesis that a victor statue was erected on the Leagros base. The same judgement may apply 10 the statue base IG I2 829 (= IG I3 1022 [lost]) also dedicated to the Twelve Gods by a son of Kallaiskhros, a victor at the Isthmian and Nemean games, 169 but we do not certainly know that this base, found on Salamis, was originally erected in the Athenian Agora.170 Raubitschek may therefore have correctly interpreted Lycurgus' intention, though not his actual wording, if indeed victor statues like the one dedicated by Leagros (and perhaps also the one belonging to the son of Kallaiskhros) were no longer in place by the fourth century. 171 On the other hand, we have no means of verifying the date of their removal and H. A. Thompson has expressed the view that the statue of Leagros might have remained in place until 'early Roman times', but no later.172 Meritt assigned the Leagros base173 to the decade 490-480, 'i.e. shortly before the Persian destruction in which we may assume the statue disappeared'.174 For Meritt, the letter form of the theta, a circle within a circle, provided the decisive criterion. The editors of IG I3 note that this form occurs in their Nos. 502, 175 561, 176 566, 177 833, 178 934, 179 964, 180 and 1147, 181 of which Nos. 502, 833, 964 and 1147 were dedicated after 479. They judge that the same stone-cutter inscribed Nos. 833 and 934, and perhaps also 502 'ubi litterae paullo deteriores sunt'. Apart from the Leagros base which they date 'c. 485-480?', L. H. Jeffery and D. M. Lewis do not explicitly assign any of the other inscriptions including circled theta to the years before the Persian sack. Among these 'undated' inscriptions, Nos. 561 and 566 are two bronze bowls 'of foreign ... probably of Phoenician origin'182 which could have come from Persian spoils. Although No. 566 was dedicated as an aparche , the tithe from the business which Deisitheos and Euthydemos used for their dedication might have represented the purchase price of the vessel. No. 934 has no find-spot, but since it was executed by the stone-cutter of No. 833, it is again possible, though by no means certain, that this inscription likewise post-dates 479. So far as the Tyrannicide base (No. 502) is concerned, we are unconvinced that it can be used as evidence for circled theta at an earlier period.183 In fact, unless a secure archaeological context can be found to support a hypothesis that the letter- form in question was already in use during the decade of the 480s, then we think it preferable to draw the tentative conclusion that all our evidence post-dates the Persian Wars. G. Daux has recently discussed the epigraphic history of circled theta in his notes on the Erechtheid casualty list (460/459). If we except the 'conscious archaism' of the eccentric base dating from 'no earlier than the 420s',184 the Erechtheid list provides the lower limit of the evidence for the use of that letter</page><page sequence="21">1 16 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS form. In Daux's judgement, 'la période d'utilisation ... a pu être très courte (vingt ans?)'185 and, unless the Leagros base provides evidence to the contrary, we see no reason to disagree with him. It is, however, impossible to know with certainty whether the Leagros base was erected before or after the Persian sack of Athens. Three hypotheses deserve consideration: (1) that the base was erected in the late 480s, but the Persians removed its statue - compare the fate of Antenor's Tyrannicide group - so that the base remained empty thereafter. This is the generally accepted view;186 (2) that the Persians removed the statue, but it was afterwards replaced by a new one (compare the later Tyrannicide monument). A variant of this view might allow that Leagros' family had itself removed the statue from its base prior to the Persian invasion since, unlike the Antenor group, the statue could have been considered private, not public property; (3) that the base was not erected until after the Persian Wars and that the statue was therefore removed at some later, unknown period, but at least by 'early Roman times' (cf. p. 115 above). The reason why the first view is currently accepted involves a number of considerations which we shall now summarise. The issue turns on the interpretation of the archaeological evidence for the parapet which enclosed the shrine. The excavators discovered the remains of two structures, the one original, the other belonging to a period after which the ground level surrounding the parapet had risen substantially.187 The Leagros base should unquestionably be associated with the original parapet since not only was it situated at the ground level of the Pisistratid foundation, but the first sill course had been cut to receive it.188 Wear was observed 'on the inner edge' of the base which 'must have occurred before the sill blocks of the second period were set in place beside it since the outer edge of the sill course shows no sign of wear'. 189 Moreover, 'wear on the top of the marble base, and on the lower sill course of the south side shows that after the statue was removed and the parapet damaged, a considerable interval elapsed before the rebuilding'.190 These observations have led scholars to follow Crosby in supposing that the Leagros base was dedicated prior to 480 and that the parapet was destroyed 'mit ziemlicher Sicherheit 480/79 v. Chr. durch die Perser',191 and left in ruins in accordance with the terms of the Oath of Plataea until the second parapet was erected c. 430. (On the other hand, the basis for the latter date, pottery found beneath the paving within the temenos, may well be specious if the interior was repaved at a time other than that of the rebuilding of the parapet.) It is surprising that so important a monument as the Altar at the topographical heart of Athens192 and perhaps a focus of dithyrambic performances193 should have been left in such a dilapidated condition during the hey-day of Athenian wealth and civic aggrandisement (but see below, p. 1 18). Although the effect of the Oath of Plataea upon Athenian building projects - not to mention the reality of the Oath itself - is hard to judge, it would be dangerous to assert that the state of dilapidation which Crosby assumes would have been so intolerable to Athens and her leaders</page><page sequence="22">LEAGROS KALOS 117 that they would necessarily have repaired it. Even so, it is equally impossible to assert with confidence that a dedicatory statue could not have been built into the temenos in the aftermath of the Persian sack, for while the 'Oath of Plataea' might have prohibited the rebuilding of pre-existing public munuments, it contained no injunction against the dedication of private ones. If Pindar's Dithyramb to the Athenians (fr. 75 Snell) is correctly dated to the 470s, it would be hard to understand the reference of 7iav8ai8aXov if the Altar and its environs manifested the kind of wreckage that the excavators of the Agora envisage. The only evidence which could lead to the conclusion that the Altar was destroyed in the Persian sack derives from the observation of wear and tear on the inner edge of the Leagros base and the upper edge of the lower sill course. 'Wear on the top of the marble base' cannot194 be regarded as diagnostic, since fifth century wear and tear would not be clearly distinguishable from that of any subsequent period. Moreover, the 'wear on the inner edge' might well represent abrasions received if the original parapet was demolished at the time of the reconstruction, or alternatively some measure of carelessness in finishing the one face which was always intended to be out of sight. Homer Thompson, however, has kindly informed us (by letter) that the wear and tear on the lower sill course of the south side, constructed as it was of soft yellow poros limestone, cannot reflect mere decomposition in situ , but 'had been fully exposed for a long time to such foot traffic as might be expected in an open area of the Agora'. Were it not for this observation we should be led to question whether the parapet was ever destroyed at all, and might have suggested that later in the fifth century, probably towards the height of the Periclean building programme, when the ßcopog itself was enlarged,195 the old Pisistratid parapet which by this time if not actually in disrepair might well have shown its age, was replaced by a smart new structure finished in keeping with contemporary building standards. This line of argument could reasonably have led to the conclusion that the original parapet was not destroyed by the Persians in 480/479, but was removed by Athenian workmen who rebuilt the sanctuary. On the other hand, even if we grant that the Altar had been destroyed by the Persians, we do not believe that sufficient grounds exist for dating the Leagros base to the decade of the 480s, a decade prior to the first indisputable attestation of the distinctive letter form which appears on its inscription. We are, however, convinced that Homer Thompson's report, based on a fresh inspection of the excavation photographs, obliges us to accept that the upper surface of the original lower sill course was exposed to traffic for a fairly considerable period. We have already suggested reasons that might militate against this kind of dilapidation in the fifth century. When Thucydides writes of the enlargement of the dimensions (prjKoç) of the Pcopóç by the demos (vi. 54) he gives no reason for us to suppose that the whole temenos was refurbished at the same time. In fact, Professor Thompson informs us that he now believes it possible that the parapet was restored at the time of Lycurgus on the basis of the comparanda of 'the euthynteria of the Temple of Apollo Patroos,</page><page sequence="23">118 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS the sill of the Eponymoi and the stylobate of the south porch of the Stoa Basileios', which he dates to the same period. Such a restoration 'would be an enterprise congenial to Lykourgos himself and closely analogous to the rehabilitation of the old shrine of Apollo Patroos'. It might even be possible to associate Lycurgus' evident disdain for the erection of victor monuments in an agora (Leoc. 5 1 , cf. p. 114 above) with the careful removal of the bronze statue of Leagros (and also that of the son of Kallaiskhros? p. 1 22 below). We must therefore allow the conclusion that the dilapidation which the excavation records imply may have occurred during the fourth century, but it is no less possible that the original parapet wall was intentionally removed down to the bottom sill, for whatever reason, at an earlier period. Indeed, the answer to the problem may well lie in Pindar's Athenian Dithyramb , where the Altar is described as the 7roXußaxov ... aaisoç ôpcpaXóv: 'the much-trodden omphalos of the city'. The scene Pindar creates allows for both 'foot traffic' and statuary, thus harmonising Homer Thompson's autopsy and our hypothesis concerning the Leagros base (on Pindar's Dithyramb , see too p. 121 below with n. 232). These conclusions lie heavily against the second hypothesis (p. 1 16 above) which in any case seems the least likely, for the excavators were able to observe that 'the statue was removed with some care'.196 This observation goes far to preclude the possibility of a replacement statue for which there is no other archaeological evidence. Moreover, regardless of the terms of the Oath of Plataea, we think it most unlikely that a privately dedicated statue base would have been left denuded in its original position at the Altar of the Twelve Gods so prominently situated in Athens' burgeoning civic centre. We therefore favour the last hypothesis, namely that the statue and its base were erected only after the Persians had withdrawn from the city. THE KISS PAINTER'S CUP (ARV 177.3) At this point we should note that the Leagros statue base was built as a two- stepped construction (Fig. 2). 197 In the tondo of the Kiss Painter's cup in Oxford, Miss. (PL I), the statue of the youth holding a javelin in one hand and his sponge bag and aryballos in the other likewise stands upon a two-stepped base which is closely comparable with the Leagros base in shape and design. Around his head the youth wears a wreath, not of laurel,198 but of olive leaves. The dipinto Leagros kalos is set around the edge of the tondo. So far we have reached the following tentative chronological conclusions: (1) that Leagros, son of Glaukon may not have been born before c. 495, and in that case could have enjoyed a &amp;û/as-period c. 480; (2) the epigraphic evidence allows the hypothesis that inscriptions using circled theta postdate 480, but does not require that they predate that year. We may therefore entertain the possibility that the Leagros base was dedicated shortly after 480 to celebrate an athletic victory. If the</page><page sequence="24">LEAGROS KALOS 119 Kiss Painter is recording that dedication, and the victorious athlete is indeed crowned with an olive wreath, then his victory is likely to have been an Olympic one and, as Raubitschek has already observed 'the javelin in the right hand of the statue indicates that the victory was won in the pentathlon'. 199 While, for reasons we shall soon discuss, we agree that a pentathletic victory is meant, this hypothesis raises an issue which Raubitschek does not address, namely that with the exception of the 38th Olympiad in 628, we have no reliable record of boys' pentathla in the archaic or classical periods.200 As S. G. Miller has, however, convincingly argued,201 boys could be admitted to competition in the men's event. (In this connection it may be significant that the order of pentathletic events - if Philostratus' testimony202 is valid for the fifth century B.C. - would make open competition of this kind as equitable as possible). Let us now consider how these observations might apply to the case of Leagros. It is customary to assume an average generational gap of some thirty to thirty-three years,203 but no one will insist on a rigid application of this useful rule of thumb. Leagros' generalship provides a terminus for his birth at 495. If the Leagros base recorded an Olympic victory, then the year 480 would have been a plausible candidate for that victory. In fact, 480 may provide a somewhat more plausible date than preceding Olympiads insofar as much of the Greek world - in particular the fighting men who might otherwise have competed at Olympia - was mobilising to confront the Persian threat. The possibility that the Olympic competition of 480 was affected by the Persian wars is tentatively supported by the evidence of the relatively complete victors' list for that year.204 Among the certain victors, we find [Dai] tondas and Arsilochus of Thebes in the chariot race, and Theagenes of Thasos in boxing, while Argos won the state victory in the horse-race. The political sympathies of Thebes and Argos in 480 require no comment, and Thasos had already 'submitted [to Mardonius' advance] without resistance'.205 Otherwise, perhaps only those states relatively close to Olympia (e.g. Mantinea) were able to contribute athletes, thus limiting the field and if so, the quality of the competition. Among the mature victors Astylus of Syracuse represents the only exception to the circumstances as we have outlined them, and this exception is easily explained. Astylus had originally owed his allegiance to Croton, a city which had produced numerous Olympic victors down the years, and in whose name he had won a double victory in 488. Possibly as early as 484, and certainly by 480, 206 he had been persuaded to run for Syracuse, whose tyrant Gelon was eager for fame and recognition at almost any cost.207 Astylus won the stadion and diaulos events three times each, and in 480 won the hoplitodrome as well, thus gaining a victory which might otherwise have been denied him had not the strength of the competition been mobilising for war. Astylos' former fellow citizens probably absented themselves from the Olympic games of 480. They had every reason to fear a Persian victory,208 and we hear of Phayllos, Croton's greatest remaining athlete, outfitting a boat which took part in the Battle of Salamis.209</page><page sequence="25">120 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS The three boys' events at Olympia in 480 were won by youths from Argos (wrestling), Heraea (boxing) and Ceos {stadion).210 None of these events would be aptly memorialised by the statue of a kouros holding a javelin, and the pick set beside the Kiss Painter's statue base is better interpreted as a reference to the 'heavy' events (in particular wrestling) of the pentathlon. The pentathletic victor at the Olympic games of 480 is not recorded and, although the name of Theopompus of Heraea has been suggested,211 his candidacy is far from certain. We therefore suggest that in 480 the young Athenian, Leagros, son of Glaukon, entered the lists of a somewhat restricted field of contestants and pulled off a spectacular victory, like that of the Aeginetan youth Sogenes at the Nemean games.212 It is surely not insignificant in this connection that the statue which Leagros dedicated in the Athenian Agora against the southwest wall of the Altar of the Twelve Gods would have faced directly towards Olympia with its own cult of the Twelve Gods reputedly established by Heracles.213 The direction of the kouros' gaze is matched by the topographical fact reported by Herodotus214 that a road 'runs from the Altar of the Twelve Gods at Athens to the Temple of Olympian Zeus at Pisa'.215 It is not a convention in the use of fcfl/os-inscriptions that the name necessarily refers to a figure depicted on the vase. Their use in this respect is therefore at variance with other naming conventions in Greek vase-painting where, for example, in mythical we frequently find a correlation between name and figure. On the other hand, not only is Leagros named on both the base and on the cup, but the coincidences in construction between the two statue bases are also striking, if we assume that the spectator on the cup is admiring the work of art before it has been embedded in the ground by the Altar. Perhaps the viewing takes place in the sculptor's workshop where the cup-painter could also be presumed to have ready access to his fellow artisan's new work.216 A statue commemorating Leagros' victory would undoubtedly have created no slight stir among the inhabitants of the Ceramicus where Leagros was perhaps celebrated as the neighbourhood hero.217 While it is improper to insist that the £û/as-inscription is necessarily related to the decoration of the Kiss Painter's tondo, we, like Raubitschek, consider it likely that it was. We do not, however, agree that Leagros is represented by both figures in youth and maturity,218 but instead we interpret only the younger one as Leagros; the older figure may be Glaukon, a trainer,219 or an erastes. The outside of the cup appropriately depicts a symposium of 'capering komasts'220 and the spectator in the tondo with his ivy wreath seems dressed for such an occasion.221 Whether Leagros kalos refers to either figure is not, however, directly relevant to the importance of this cup for arguments about the absolute chronology of Greek vase-painting. Once the possibility has been conceded that the Kiss Painter's cup may depict the Leagros base and that the Leagros base was dedicated very soon after 480, then the cup's date would necessarily undergo a corresponding revision comparable with the one suggested by the alternative dating of Leagros' birth to c. 495. In other words, if Leagros was in his late teens in the early 470s, the vases that</page><page sequence="26">LEAGROS KALOS 121 praise him (regardless of any potential imprecision in the reference of kalos- names) can no longer be dated to c. 510-505 B.C. We must now attempt to reconstruct the possible circumstances which could have led to the dedication of this base and statue in so prominent a position in the Athenian Agora. A Leagros born c. 495 would have been too young to fight at Salamis and Plataea, just as Cimon222 evidently did not participate in the Battle of Marathon. A Leagros in his mid-teens, however, would certainly have been of an age to win renown for his city as an athlete. The ethical equivalence of athletic and military achievement in ancient Greece is well-known. Military and athletic renown are celebrated side by side in the posthumous epigram to Callimachus, polemarch at Marathon,223 and the metaphor is still alive in Plutarch's Life of Cimon.224 Indeed, we see the equation again and again in the compositional programmes of Greek vases and it is among Pindar's most familiar epinician conventions.225 The victor at the games is typically likened to a warrior and in particular to a spearman (e.g. aixpr|Tïlç). When Pindar praises the youthful Sogenes of Aegina, 'judged through his achievement glorious among pentathletes'226 - a boy victorious in the men's event227 - he selects the image of a successful javelin cast to indicate the accuracy of his encomium.228 We therefore suggest that Leagros' javelin (of which even the thongs are visible) may evoke not only his recent victory in the Olympic pentathlon, but also this ideological connection between the athlete's javelin and a hoplite's spear. Leagros thus contributed to the glory of the Athenian triumph at Salamis in 480 by his athletic achievement at Olympia. Indeed, the ethical value of kclXóç, may well extend beyond a reference to physical and/ or moral handsomeness in a youth or young woman. The close association of both the adjective KaXôq and the noun KáXXoç with K^éoç 'renown' and its derivatives is well-attested from the period of Glaukon and his famous son.229 Such an association may have been paronomastic in origin, but it doubtless fed, and was fed by, the Greek sense that physical excellence betokened moral excellence and as such was worthy of praise. Perhaps in the case of the Kiss Painter's cup the artist intends a double entendre: Leagros KaWę, acclaimed for his KáXXoç„ has won kXcoç through his Olympic victory and has thus become doubly KaXóç.230 The location of Leagros' dedication itself suggests that some special significance was attached to it for the Altar of the Twelve Gods 'marked this precise spot as the very centre of Athens; it served as a central milestone from which distances were measured, and it was almost certainly what Pindar called in his dithyramb in honour of the Athenians "the omphalos (navel) of the city, much-trodden, fragrant with incense"'.231 If Bowra is correct in tentatively accepting a date 'after, but not long after, the Persian Wars'232 for the performance of this dithyramb, then nav8ai8aXov (line 5) may well commemorate such newly erected sculpture as the Tyrannicide monument 'in the middle of the square'233 and Leagros' own bronze statue beside the Altar of the Twelve Gods for both the orchestra and the Altar seem to have played an important rôle in dithyrambic performances.234</page><page sequence="27">122 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS There may, however, be a more particular explanation for this unusual association of private monument and public shrine. In a forthcoming article, we shall argue pace J. K. Davies235 that Kallaiskhros, named by Vitruvius236 as one of the architects of the Pisistratid Olympieion, was the brother of Glaukon (I) and thus Leagros' uncle. We suggest that the Altar of the Twelve Gods was erected in part as a provisional shrine pending the completion of the massive Olympieion. Kallaiskhros may well have also been involved in the construction of this more modest sanctuary so that the family of Leagros would thus have had some special stake in its existence. It is possible, though at this stage impossible to prove, that family members served as priests at the shrine. At any rate, Leagros' later choregic success implies his continuing interest in events associated with the Altar. While we share Davies' doubts237 that Kritias (IV) was the son of Kallaiskhros who later in the century dedicated another victor statue, in all probability at the same Altar (see p. Ill above), we assume that the dedicant's father was a descendant of Kallaiskhros the Pisistratid architect, and kin to Leagros and his son Glaukon (II). We associate this new dedication with the refurbishment of the Altar some time in the 430s - perhaps undertaken by the family of Leagros and Kallaiskhros - and think it possible in view of the dithyrambic associations of the Altar that this refurbishment may have been connected with the erection of Pericles' Odeion. Although the Pisistratid Olympieion was not brought to completion until the time of Hadrian,238 the Twelve Gods found a new home on the east frieze of the Parthenon. The notional presence of Dionysus in dithyrambic performances at the old Altar may have been a contributory factor to his introduction to the Parthenon pantheon.239 THE PSEUDO-THEMISTOCLEAN LETTER When W. Gauer examined the evidence for Leagros' life, he stated that the evidence of the Pseudo-Themistoclean Letter should not be called into question without serious grounds: 'Obwohl das Leagrosdatum aus einer vereinzelten Nachricht aus dem 2. Jh. n. Chr. und der von Unklarheiten nicht ganz freien Überlieferung über das Geburtsjahr des Themistokles kombiniert ist, sollte man es nicht ohne dringliche Gründe anzweifeln'.240 We believe such grounds indeed exist. As Davies has observed, 'the credentials of this statement [concerning Leagros' coevality with Themistocles], as of much in the Themistoklean letters, are so thoroughly obscure that it would be unwise to place too much weight on it'.241 Even G. M. A. Richter, who accepted Leagros' kalos- period as a 'landmark' in the chronology of Greek art, questioned the appropriateness of using the Themistoclean letter to date his career. She also drew attention to the fact that 'the term ai)ve(pr|ßo&lt;; is an anachronism',242 but this point is insufficient by itself to discredit the epistolographer's view of the relationship between Themistocles and</page><page sequence="28">LEAGROS KALOS 123 Leagros. Scepticism regarding the reliability of the Letters as a whole and the possibility of their multiple authorship243 does not necessarily imply that their testimony in respect of Leagros is worthless. The Eighth Letter has in fact been recently described as 'important ... in that it contains a good deal of otherwise unattested information';244 the credibility of this information is of course another matter.245 In the Twenty-first Letter,246 the writer shows some surprisingly specialised knowledge, for example, of the official Persian script change c. 520 from Aramaic to Achaemenian cuneiform. The writer is also acquainted with traditions concerning many of Themistocles' lesser-known contemporaries. For example, he addresses the Fourth and Tenth Letters to Themistocles' associate, Habronikhos son of Lysikles,247 and knows of his embassy to Sparta.248 In the Letter to Leagros, he mentions Pronapes of Prasiai,249 perhaps the Pronapes who dedicated a lavish chariot group on the Athenian Acropolis recording his many victories at the great games.250 This awareness of personalities in early fifth century Athenian history about whom we are otherwise less than fully informed might appear at first sight to argue in favour of the epistolographer's intimate knowledge of the period. On the other hand, a writer who has chosen, for whatever reason, to compose a series of polemic Tristia251 in the name of Themistocles might be expected to acquire some rudimentary facts about his topic.252 The story of Themistocles was a popular Stoic exemplum253 and F. J. Frost rightly identifies the custom [sc. during the Hellenistic period] of taking anecdotes about greed or political cleverness or depraved youth and inserting the name of Themistocles ... During the flowering of theatrical rhetoric during the Second Sophistic, everything that had ever been written about Themistocles and the other famous personages of what was by then ancient history was assiduously collected and catalogued in the form of ethical or historical exempla for the convenience of students of rhetoric.254 Thucydides and Herodotus could have provided the germ for the Letters to Habronikhos, and a visit to Athens might have acquainted him with Pronapes' monument. The name of Leagros would have been available from either kind of source, not to mention the compilations of which Frost speaks. The epistolographer's report that Pronapes was one of the prosecutors at Themistocles' trial may thus have had documentary foundation or perhaps his name merely served to give verisimilitude to romantic fiction. We have no means of determining with any certainty the answers to questions such as these.255 Although the likelihood that the pseudo-Themistoclean corpus is a literary confection, organised with skill and effectively embellished, does not automatically render its biographical content fictitious, we hesitate to claim in the light of our present knowledge that 'Themistocles" protestations of fellowship with</page><page sequence="29">124 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS Leagros throughout the letter indicate any more than that the epistolographer has found a viable candidate to lend a willing and sympathetic ear to the statesman in exile. To argue that an otherwise undocumented connection between Themistocles and Leagros underlies the Ceramicus ostracon which speaks of the latter as a 'traitor' (cf. p. 101 above) is surely to overread the evidence. In the absence of further documentary corroboration, to invoke what may be no more than a rhetorical conceit as decisive support for dating Leagros kalos to the sixth century strikes us as hazardous in the extreme. We entirely agree with J. Kleine's conclusion to his own careful study of the Themistoclean Letter: 'Das Zeugnis des 8. "Themistokles-Briefes" kann nicht mehr als verbindlich angesehen werden, wenn andere Gründe eine Verschiebung dieses Datums [sc. for Leagros' birth c. 526/5 - 524/3] möglich oder wahrscheinlich erscheinen lassen'.256 We do not deny the possibility, though no one to our knowledge has so far suggested it, that Leagros won an Olympic victory during the games held, for example, in 508 when, according to the conventional chronology, he would have been sixteen or seventeen years old. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that he dedicated a statue in his own honour to record such a victory, and that the Kiss Painter about the same time decorated a cup which depicted the statue and Leagros' father, trainer or er astes, gazing admiringly at it. Like Antenor's Tyrannicide group of the same period, this bronze statue was stolen by the Persians at the time of the sack of Athens. After his return Leagros then replaced the statue with the new base appropriately inscribed. We cannot dismiss the possibility that these events may have occurred more or less as we have just described them, but we know of no evidence beyond the fragile indications of the Eighth Letter which might encourage us to suppose that they did. Indeed, it seems to us that such a hypothesis not only offends against the economy of Ockham's razor, but more properly merits the name of 'romantic fiction' than the alternative solution we have proposed. There appears to be no clear-cut solution to the chronological cruces raised by Leagros' vita and any decision necessarily remains a speculative one. Nevertheless, given the available evidence, we think it more likely that Leagros dedicated his victor statue shortly after 480 to commemorate an Olympic victory achieved in that difficult year than that the anonymous epistolographer's mention of Leagros' 'synepheby' with Themistocles should be taken literally. At least we have attempted to show that the evidence of Leagros' career as a pais kalos is so fraught with uncertainties that his repeated acclamation on Greek vases can no longer be interpreted as if it provided a form of date-stamp. While Leagros kalos, like the Leagros base, 'datiert nicht, er ist zu datieren',257 we favour the hypothesis of the lower date for Leagros' birth since it agrees with other positive evidence for lowering the chronology of archaic Greek art.258 UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN and ASHMOLEAN MUSEUM, OXFORD E.

It is conceivable that Phayllos himself may have thus drawn some good athletes away from the competition so that Astylos (if he had not already transferred his allegiance before the Games of 484) decided to cast his lot with a city not mobilising for Salamis and with a patron willing to sponsor him before he became too long in the tooth to win. Elis would at any rate have been glad to have a 'big-name' competitor since her revenue and prestige depended in no small measure on the successful conduct of the Games. 210. The presence of a Cean youth is perhaps significant. Ceos contributed to the Greek fleet at Salamis (the islanders are included in the list on the Serpent Column); those beneath military age seem to have been free to compete at Olympia.</page><page sequence="39">134 E. D. FRANCIS AND MICHAEL VICKERS 211. Moretti (n. 204) 74-5, 76, 85, 87, 104, gives the relevant facts. There were in fact two Olympic victors named Theopompus, and they were the son and grandson respectively of Damaratus of Heraea who was victor twice in the hoplitodrome event in 520 and 516. Theopompus (II) won the wrestling twice and his victories have to be after 444 when the information from P. Oxy. 222 ceases. Theopompus (I) cannot have been a victor after 480, again on account of P. Oxy. 222, and Moretti consequently placed him as late in the period before 480 as he could. On the evidence Moretti presents, Theopompus (I) could have won his victories at many Olympiads between 504 and 480 so that there is no reason to suppose that our hypothesis regarding Leagros' victory in 480 is contradicted by Theopompus' prior claim. 212. Miller (n. 201), and see below, p. 121. 213. Pind. Ol. 10. 43-9. 214. Hdt. 2. 7. 215. For such close attention to the significant orientation of epinician monuments in the fifth century, compare our interpretation of the Stoa Poikile as belvedere: 'Oenoe' (n. 16). 216. On the proximity of potters' and sculptors' workshops in the Ceramicus, see Thompson and Wycherley (n. 1 74) 1 85-9 1 . The aryballos and sponge bag in the background and the pick beside the base do not require us to suppose that the statue is being viewed in a gymnasium, but may simply serve to define the athletic character of the monument. 217. Cf. Davies, A PF, 90, and p. 100 above. (Raubitschek's suggestion 'that the small hole near the left front corner on the top of the base once received the end of the javelin held by the athlete in his right hand' [Raubitschek (n. 29) 162-3] is, as Crosby has shown [Crosby (n. 170) 94, n. 29], unsupported by any archaeological evidence. A potentially significant contradiction between statue and cup is thus eliminated). 218. Pace Kleine (n. 14) 92: 'eine Deutung, die zunächst ebenso überrascht wie überzeugt'; cf. Guarducci's objections (n. 32) 132-3. 219. So Robinson (n. 29) 13. 220. J. D. Beazley, Campana fragments in Florence (1933) 20, No. 56. 221. This symposium may include the image of a slightly older Leagros (again wearing an olive wreath) in the free field at the centre of B (in fact, the front of the cup), with his companion of the tondo again to his left. At least some passage of time might be expected to have elapsed between the actual victory and the execution of the commemorative monument; cf. P.

In any case its date is not diagnostic for the Leagros base; we are merely noting that, if Leagros' dedication was in situ by the time of Pindar's composition, then it would naturally have been included within the reference of TtavôaíôaXov. 233-.
