Tomeo3 Alaska Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey, 1011 East Tudor Road, Anchorage, Alaska 99503 USA Received 21 June 2002; accepted 26 November 2002 ABSTRACT. We examined whether surgically-implanted radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas affected behavior of Lesser Canada Geese (Branta canadensis parvipes) in Anchorage, Alaska. We implanted either a 26-g VHF radio transmitter or a larger VHF radio that was the same mass (35 g) and shape as a satellite transmitter in the coelom of adult females captured during molt in 2000. A control group of females was marked with leg bands. We simultaneously observed behavior of radio-marked and control females from 4-62 d following capture. We observed no differences in the proportion of time birds in different treatments allocated among grazing, resting, comfort, walking, and alert behavior. Females in different treatments spent a similar proportion of time in the water. Implantation of radio transmitters did not affect the frequency of agonistic interactions. We conclude that coelomic radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas had minimal effects on the behavior of Canada Geese. SINOPSIS. El efecto de la implantaci6n de radiotransmisores con antenas percutaneas en la conducta de Gansos del Canad&amp; (Branta canadensis) Examinamos si el implantar por medios quirurgicos radiotransmisores con antenas percutaneas en individuos de Gansos de Canada' (Branta canadensis parvipes) afectaba la conducta de las aves. El estudio se llev6 a cabo en Anchorage, Alaska. Implantamos ya sean radiotransmisores de 26 g u otro similar de 35 g, (con la misma masa y forma) en el celoma de hembras adultas, que fueron capturadas durante la epoca de muda del 2000. Un grupo control de hembras fue marcada anillas en las patas. Simultaneamente observamos la conducta de los animales experimentales y controles por un lapso de 4-64 dias. No se observaron diferencias en la conducta de las aves referente a la alimentacion, descanso, comfort, caminar y conducta de alerta. Las hembras de ambos grupos pasaron periodos de tiempo similares en el agua. La implantaci6n de los transmisores no afecto la frecuencia de interacciones agresivas. Concluimos que la implantaci6n de los radiotransmisores en la cavidad celomica tiene efecto minimo en la conducta de los Gansos del Canada. Key words: behavior, Branta canadensis, coelomic-implant transmitters, radio telemetry, transmitter effects Attachment of radio transmitters can alter behavior of birds (White and Garrott 1990; Withey et al. 2001). In waterfowl, radio attach- ment may increase preening or resting, and re- duce locomotion or time spent feeding (Perry 1981; Sorenson 1989; Pietz et al. 1993; Blouin et al. 1999; Garrettson et al. 2000). Habitat use can also be altered if radio-marked birds spend less time in water (Greenwood and Sargent 1973; Gilmer et al. 1974; Wooley and Owen 1978; Garrettson et al. 2000).

The method of radio attachment can greatly affect animal response to a transmitter. Several studies have found that radio transmitters that are surgically implanted in the coelom (Korsch- gen et al. 1984) have fewer negative effects on survival, reproduction, and behavior of water- fowl than transmitters that are externally at- tached (Rotella et al. 1993; Dzus and Clark 250</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 74, No. 3 Effects of Abdominal Radio Transmitters 251 1996; Paquette et al. 1997; Garrettson and Rohwer 1998; Garrettson et al. 2000). Those studies examined coelomic transmitters that had internal antennas. However, implanting the antenna completely within the coelom can re- duce reception range of VHF transmitters (Korschgen et al. 1984; Olsen et al. 1992; Gar- rettson and Rohwer 1998; Boyd et al. 2000) and is not possible with satellite transmitters. Korschgen et al. (1996) developed a procedure for surgically implanting coelomic radio trans- mitters that have a percutaneous antenna that exits the body. The technique has been used to implant satellite and VHF transmitters in wa- terbirds for studies of migration and survival (Petersen et al. 1999; Boyd et al. 2000; Esler et al. 2000a; Hatch et al. 2000). However, there has been little evaluation of whether coelomic transmitters with percutaneous antennas affect behavior of birds. Studies that examined effects of coelomic transmitters with internal antennas may not apply to implanted transmitters in which the antenna exits the body. The surgical procedure differs, and the external antenna might alter a bird's behavior. We examined the effects of coelomic radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas on the behavior of female Lesser Canada Geese (Branta canadensis parvipes) in Anchorage, Alaska. Our objectives were to contrast behavior of individ- uals in radio-marked and control groups at dif- ferent times following surgery. Testing of trans- mitter effects in an urban population of geese enabled us to study free-ranging, migratory birds that were acclimated to people and easily observed. STUDY AREA AND METHODS The Anchorage municipal area encompasses 260 km2 in southcentral Alaska. Lesser Canada Geese have nested in Anchorage since at least the early 1970s. The population at the onset of the study was approximately 3000 individuals. Canada Geese typically arrive in Anchorage in early April, nest during May and June, molt in late June and July, and depart for wintering ar- eas in October. Treatments. We captured most Canada Geese during molt from 12-15 July 2000. We transported adult females to a surgical facility where each was randomly assigned to control, small transmitter (26 g), or large transmitter (35 g) treatments. All transmitters broadcast in the VHF range, were manufactured by Holohill Systems, Limited (Carp, Ontario), and had a 27.5-cm external whip antenna. The small transmitters were cylindrical, 4 cm long, 1.5 cm in diameter, and were 1.3% of the average fe- male body mass of 1990 g. The large transmit- ters were built to the same external dimensions as a Microwave Telemetry (Columbia, Mary- land) PTT- 100 implant satellite transmitter. They were 1.8% of average body mass, and were 5 cm long, 3 cm in height, and 1.5 cm at their widest point. We deployed 36 of each size of transmitter. There were 68 females in the control group, including 14 females cap- tured during nesting and surplus females caught during molt after radios had been deployed. Veterinarians implanted radio transmitters following Korschgen et al. (1996). Anesthesia was induced via 4% isoflurane in oxygen at a rate of 1.5 1/min. Isoflurane concentration was reduced to 1.5-3% during surgery. A 3-cm in- cision was made at the ventral midline and the transmitter placed into the right abdominal air sac. A nylon mesh bag that surrounded the transmitter was sutured to the body wall. The percutaneous antenna exited caudally near the junction of the right pubic bone and synsa- crum. Approximately 26 cm of the antenna was exposed outside the body. The antenna was se- cured by a suture through the body wall into a synthetic collar at the base of the antenna. Sur- gery required about 40 min/bird. Females were allowed to recover from surgery for 1-3 h and were fully alert when released at capture sites. Control females were anesthetized for 5-10 min and held for up to 3 h. No geese died during handling or surgery. All birds were marked with a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service metal leg band and a colored tarsus band with a unique numeric code. Females previously marked with neck collars (York et al. 2000) were not included in our study. Measurement of behavior. We recorded behavior of radio-marked females from 4-62 days after surgery (18 July-i5 September). Most observations occurred between 07:00 and 16:00. We located radio-marked females by fol- lowing radio signals or visually scanning flocks. Separate observers simultaneously watched a ra- dio-marked and a control female in the same flock for up to 30 min. All observations were initiated when geese were on land where they</page><page sequence="3">| : . . . .

We used field computers to continuously record dura- tion of five terrestrial behaviors (grazing, rest- ing, alert, walking, and comfort movements), time in water, and the incidence of agonistic interactions. Preening of abdominal feathers was recorded for all birds, and preening or pull- ing on the external antenna recorded for radio- marked geese. We also noted whether a female was mated. None of the females we observed had goslings because most juvenile geese had been captured and transported out of the area in an effort to control the local population. We alternated observations between females with small and large transmitters when both types of radio-marked birds were in a flock. A different control female was selected for each observation J.

We deducted the amount of time a goose was obscured from view during an observation bout and eliminated paired ob- servations if one of the birds was observed &lt; 10 min. We used a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to compare arcsin transformations of the proportion of time females in different treatments spent in the five classes of terrestrial behavior. Time preening abdominal feathers or the external antenna was included in comfort movements. The analysis was blocked by pairs of females that were simultaneously observed. We divided observations into six 10-d periods and tested for an interaction between treatment and period. We did not include time in water in the MANOVA because we rarely observed geese swimming after they completed molt in late July. Because 81% of the time geese were in water was recorded in the first 20 d of ob- servation, we used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare time in water during that period only. We divided those data into tWo 10-d intervals to examine temporal differ- ences among treatments. Aggressive encounters were typically quite brief (&lt;2 s), and therefore we used a random- ization test for paired data (Manly 1997) to r r * * * - compare trequency or agonlstlc lnteractlons that involved radio-marked or control females. We calculated the difference in frequencies be- tween paired observations then reversed the sign of randomly-selected differences in 1000 iterations. We determined the proportion of random data sets in which the absolute sum of the differences was greater or equal to the ab- solute sum of observed differences. RESULTS We observed 35 geese in the small transmit- ter treatment, 33 birds in the large transmitter group, and 56 control females. Most (51) of the control females had been captured during molt. We conducted 86 paired observations of small transmitter and control females (39.9 h) and 87 paired observations of large transmitter and control females (40.5 h). Mean duration of each observation, minus time a bird was lost from view, was 28.1 min (SD = 4.5). At least</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 74, No. 3 Effects of Abdominal Radio Transmitters 253 63% of radio-marked females and 68% of con- trol females appeared to be mated. Females spent an average of 96% (SD = 9.8) of an observation bout engaged in terrestrial be- havior. The proportion of time females allocat- ed to different behavior was similar among treatments (F10,310 = 0.3, P = 0.97). There was no interaction between treatment and time since surgery (F50,710 = 0.7, P = 0.95). We pooled transmitter sizes for presentation of means because of similarities between treat- ments (Fig. 1). The amount of time birds in each radio transmitter treatment spent in water in the first 20 d after surgery was similar to control females (F263 = 0.9, P= 0.40, Fig. 2), with no interaction between treatment and time period (F2,63 = 0.2, P = 0.82, Fig. 2). Frequency of agonistic interactions did not differ (P = 0.54) between females with small transmitters (x = 0.09 interactions/min, 95% CI = 0.07-0.1 1) and control females (x = 0.08 interactions/min, 95% CI = 0.07-0.10). Oc- currence of agonistic encounters was also sim- ilar (P = 0.29) between females with large transmitters (x = 0.11 interactions/min, 95% CI = 0.08-0.13) and the control group (x = 0.09 interactions/min, 95% CI = 0.06-0.11). We observed preening of the antenna or its exit site in 1 1% of the 161 observation bouts in which radio-marked birds engaged in com- fort behavior. Preening of the antenna or exit site composed an average of 2.6% (SD = 8.8) and 0.1% (SD = 0.7) of the time radio-marked females spent in comfort behavior during the first 10 and final 50 d of observation, respec- tively. A single female, seen six days after sur- gery, was responsible for 75% of the total time radio-marked geese were observed preening the external antenna. The same female did not preen the antenna or exit site when observed 33 d later. During the first 10 d of observation, radio-marked and control females devoted an average of 5.3% (95% CI = 0.9-9.7) and 3.0% (95% CI = 0.9-5.0) of their respective times in comfort behavior to the preening of abdom- inal feathers. During the final 50 d of obser- vation, the time spent preening abdominal feathers was 3.8% (95% CI = 2.1-5.4) and 2.0% (95% CI = 1.0-3.0) of comfort behavior for radio-marked and control females, respec- tively. * 0.1$ 0.1 *01 i fi f 11-27 281 - (44) (3 Fig. 2.

DISCUSSION Coelomically-implanted radio transmitters had minimal effects on behavior of Canada Geese. We do not believe that geese were tol- erant of transmitters simply because they lived in an urban environment. Anchorage Canada Geese were acclimated to people but did not rely on anthropomorphic sources of food. Feed- ing of geese was discouraged by local wildlife agencies, and we observed only four instances where focal geese were briefly attracted to peo- ple with food. Geese were subject to predation by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and harassment by domestic dogs. Furthermore, Anchorage geese were migratory and spent ap- proximately six months of the year in agricul- tural areas of western Oregon. Their annual en- ergetic requirements were likely comparable to similar-sized geese that nest elsewhere in south central and western Alaska. Testing of trans- mitter effects in urban geese was preferable to studies in a captive setting and allowed us to observe birds more closely than would be pos- sible in a completely wild population. Although we lacked observations for the first three days following surgery, normal behavior within 14 d of implantation indicates that geese recovered quickly. The relatively large size of the birds, their use of terrestrial habitats, and low mobility during molt were likely conducive to rapid recovery from surgery. We expect that</page><page sequence="5">254 J WHupp et al. J. Field Ornithol. similar-sized species of geese would also quickly recover from implantation of radio transmitters during molt. Garrettson et al. (2000) noted that Blue-winged Teal (Anas discors) recovered from implant surgery rapidly. However, slow re- covery and high mortality have been observed in some marine birds following implantation of radios with percutaneous antennas (Meyers et al. 1998; Hatch et al. 2000). The effects of radio transmitters on comfort behavior are a special concern in waterfowl. Birds that spend more time preening transmit- ters, antennas, or harnesses may devote less time to feeding or vigilance. The amount of time Canada Geese engaged in comfort behav- ior did not differ between radio-marked and control females during any period after capture. During the first 14 d after surgery we observed that some individuals repeatedly preened the external antenna. However, even during that period, antenna-preening composed only about 3-5% of the time that geese spent in comfort behavior. Geese paid little attention to the an- tenna during the final 50 d of observation. Preening of the antenna generally occurred while the bird was preening feathers, and typ- ically was a brief instance in which the goose ran its bill along the antenna wire. We observed no instances where geese pulled the antenna as though trying to dislodge or break it. Radio- marked females also devoted a small amount of their time in comfort behavior to preening ab- dominal feathers near the incision. Attachment of external radio transmitters can increase the amount of time waterfowl spend in comfort be- havior (Greenwood and Sargent 1973; Gilmer et al. 1974; Wooley and Owen 1978; Perry 1981; Pietz et al. 1993; Blouin et al. 1999; Gar- rettson et al. 2000). Coelomic transmitters dis- place fewer feathers than external transmitters and provide less of a visual cue that might incite preening. Garrettson et al. (2000) observed that implantation of coelomic radio transmitters with internal antennas did not increase time that captive Blue-winged Teal devoted to com- fort movements. Radio-marked and control females probably spent more time feeding as summer progressed because they were building endogenous reserves in preparation for migration (McLandress and Raveling 1981). There was no evidence that transmitters impaired feeding at any time, in- cluding the period of high forage intake in late summer. We expect that any effects of coelomic radios on feeding behavior or digestive function would be especially noticeable in geese because they are herbivorous, spend a high proportion of the day feeding, and process large volumes of forage (Owen 1972; Sibley 1981). Reduc- tions in feeding time caused by externally at- tached radios (Perry 1981; Pietz et al. 1993; Blouin et al. 1999) could be a problem for wa- terfowl during periods of high nutritional de- mand. Reduced nesting effort (Sorenson 1989; Rotella et al. 1993; Paquette et al. 1997; Gar- rettson and Rohwer 1998) and lowered survival (Ward and Flint 1995; Dzus and Clark 1996; Schmutz and Morse 2000) among birds marked with external transmitters could par- tially be due to reductions in forage intake and increased energetic demands imposed by radios. Annual survival and change in body mass of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) that carried coelomic radios with percutaneous an- tennas were similar to ducks without radios (Es- ler et al. 2000b). Coelomic radios did not affect locomotion of geese. Birds appeared to walk and swim nor- mally upon release, and during no period did we observe differences in time devoted to walk- ing. Because geese were molting we could not determine if their flight ability was affected im- mediately after surgery. However, we have ob- served that Canada Geese that received coelo- mic radios during nesting could fly upon their release. Long distance migrations (&gt;500 km) of ducks with coelomic transmitters have been ob- served (Olsen et al. 1992; Petersen et al. 1999). The surgical procedure used for radio implan- tation likely resulted in relatively little trauma to the muscles birds use in walking or flight. The ventral incision was at the midline juncture of oblique muscles of the abdomen and severed relatively little muscle tissue. Muscles affected by the incision were primarily involved in com- pression of internal organs and not locomotion. The exit hole for the antenna avoided pelvic muscles involved in walking or swimming and was formed by blunt dissection to minimize cutting of muscle fibers. We likely underestimated the time marked geese spent in the water because we only initi- ated observation bouts when geese were on land. We do not think that bias affected our comparison of the time radio-marked females spent in water relative to control birds. Birds in</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 74, No. 3 Effects of Abdominal Radio Transmitters 255 each treatment had equal opportunity to use aquatic habitats after observations were initiat- ed. There were no differences in the relative amounts of time radio-marked and control fe- males spent in water, and we observed that ra- dio-marked females typically would swim upon their release. Waterfowl with external transmit- ters occasionally spend less time in water (Greenwood and Sargeant 1973; Pietz et al. 1993; Garrettson et al. 2000), whereas that ef- fect was not seen for Blue-winged Teal with implanted radios (Garrettson et al. 2000). Implantation of radio transmitters also did not affect a female's dominance, as radio- marked and control females engaged in similar numbers of agonistic encounters. We expected that higher numbers of aggressive interactions would have been directed towards radio-marked females had the surgical procedure or the pres- ence of the antenna diminished dominance. Implantation of radios also did not appear to affect the likelihood that a female was mated. Our estimate of the proportion of marked fe- males that were mated was conservative because we could not clearly determine whether a fe- male was associated with another goose during some observations. Our study and Garrettson et al's. (2000) in- dicate that coelomically-implanted radios have minimal effects on behavior of some species of waterfowl. Our study further indicates that per- cutaneous antennas can be used to increase the reception range of coelomic VHF radios and allow implantation of satellite radio transmit- ters without altering the behavior of geese. Coe- lomically-implanted transmitters may be pref- erable to externally attached radios if biologists wish to minimize behavioral changes often as- sociated with radio-marking of waterfowl. However, implanted radios with percutaneous antennas may adversely impact some species (Meyers et al. 1998; Hatch et al. 2000), and their effects need to be more fully evaluated in other avian taxa.
