<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOASTRONOMY OF MOUNT TLALOC, MEXICO: A RECONSIDER TION Stanistaw Iwaniszewski This paper reevaluates the architectural remains atop Mount Tlaloc in light of recent contributions by Aveni et al.(1988),Broda(1989,l991asl991b),andrownsend(1991).Evidencesuggeststhattherewereatleasttwo phases of architectural activity on the mountain An archaeoastronomical analysis of the ceremonial enclosure leads to the suggestion that the orientation of the structure reveals a paradigm marking out specifis days by denoting positions of the sun-at-horizon events at intervals of 20 days. This may be a reference to the nemontemi days of the Mexican 365-day solar calendar. Mount Tlaloc also appears to be associated with other mountains through visual lines that correlate with sunrise on dates when ceremonies were performed in sanctuaries situated on prominent elevations. A la luz de las contribuciones recientes de Aveni et al (1988), Broda (1989, 1991a, l 991b), y Townsend (1991) se re-evaluan los restos arquitectonicos en la cumbre del Cerro Tlaloc. La evidencia sugiere que hubieron por lo menos dos fases de construccion en la montana. La investigacion arqueoastronomica del recinto ceremonial hace suponer que la orientacion de la estructura revela un paradigma mostrando los dias determinados a traves de la denotacion de las posiciones del sol en el horizonte en los intervalos de 20 dias. Posiblemente hay una referencia a los dias nemontemi del calendario mexicano de 365 dias. Cerro Tlaloc parece tambien asociarse a otras montanas por medio de las Ifneas visuales que corresponden a las salidas/puestas del sol en dfas del calendario cuando se llevaban a cabo las ceremonias en los santuarios colocados en alturas relevantes. In a recent article Aveni et al. (1988) suggest that the location and orientation of the Templo Mayor, the main temple of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, might have been influenced by the mountain cult of Tlaloc and the position of a ceremonial enclosure atop Mount Tlaloc on the eastern horizon. Considering the location of the Templo Mayor as a center and eastern mountaintops as a periphery, the authors hypothesize that a kind of horizon calendar, consisting of the marking of solar divisions on the horizon at 20-day intervals (exactly the length of one mesoamerican month), might have been developed. They conclude that the calendar was anchored at equinoxes, and they provide an example of the visual line that links the Templo Mayor with Mount Telapon, the high mountain just south of Mount Tlaloc. This alignment corresponds to sunrise on March 1 (Aveni et al. 1988:302, Figure 5),20 days before the vernal equinox. The authors argue that the ceremonial precinct atop Mount Tlaloc formed part of a scheme for fixing a precise calendar in the landscape and was important "in the planning and orientation scheme of the Templo Mayor" (Aveni et al. 1988:301-302; consult Figure 1 forgeographic referents). In other recent presentations, Broda (1989, l991a, l991b) discusses the mountain cult of the Aztecs and the sanctuary on Mount Tlaloc. She also advocates the idea that in ancient Mesoamerica, time and space were coordinated in the landscape through the orientations of buildings and sites. She suggests, furthermore, that most important ceremonial dates were fixed by reference marks located on the horizon. She proposes that because the mountain cult was one of the very ancient and fundamental aspects in their cosmovision, groups in the Basin of Mexico created a cultural landscape (with mountaintops included) based on alignments and geometry. In Broda's view, the Templo Mayor-Mount Tlaloc alignment is only one example of such a structured whole, and other arrangements connecting Mount Tlaloc with diffierent sites in the Basin of Mexico might also have existed (e.g., Broda 1991 a:474, 1991 b:92).

Eastern part of the Mexican highlands. Contour intervals from 1,000 to 3,000 m asl. Checking of diffierent orientations linked to Mount Tlaloc revealed a cluster of dates at the end of April and beginning of May associated with such astronomical and meteorological events as disappearance of the Pleiades, zenithal passage of the sun, and the beginning of the rainy season. Archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic data indicate that the phenomena coincide with the time of maize sowing in dry lands and associated agricultural rites. Broda also notes that the contemporary Feast of the Holy Cross on May 3 maintains most of the ritual functions of the ceremonies performed in the Mexican month Huey Tozoztli (April 13-May 2 in the correlation proposed by Tichy and modified by Broda [1983]; all dates, unless otherwise indicated, are Gregorian) when an important ritual on Mount Tlaloc was celebrated. Townsend (1991) discusses the possible symbolic significance of the layout of Mount Tlaloc's ceremonial precinct. The structure consists of a rectangular, double-walled enclosure and a causeway attached on its western side. Townsend (1991:28) notes the presence of large boulders placed on the corners of the rectangle and natural rock outcroppings situated roughly at its center. He suggests that the central rock stood at the junction of the intercardinal points marked by corner boulders, in duplication of a scheme in the Codex Borgia (presumably pages 28-29) where Tlaloc stands at the center and four tlaloque (the rain forms corresponding to the world's directions) are at the corners. An artificially cut pit in the eastern part of the site could represent the earth-navel that was thought to allow access to the mountain's interior. There have been three diffierent approaches thus far to the study of spatial ordering at Mount Tlaloc. Aveni et al. (1988) explore the significance of the place from the perspective of the Templo Mayor. Broda (199lb:92) extends the list of the Basin of Mexico sites aligned with Mount Tlaloc but advocates the reverse perspective, from Mount Tlaloc westward. The third approach (Townsend 1991 :28) interprets the site's topography as a locus sagradus centered at the Tlaloc's realm (Townsend 1991:28). In this paper I focus on the eastward orientation of the sanctuary, which suggests that alignments between Mount Tlaloc and mountaintops and ceremonial sites in the Valley of Puebla should be examined. I also explore the possibility that calendrics based on horizon solar observations might have been consciously embedded in the planning of the precinct. MOUNT TLALOC Geographical Setting Mount Tlaloc, ca. 4,150 m asl, is the highest peak of the part of the Sierra Nevada called Sierra del Rio Frio (see Figure 1) that separates the valleys of Mexico and Puebla. It rises over two diffierent</page><page sequence="3">160 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 5, No. 2, 1994 ecological zones: alpine meadows and subalpine forests (Figure 2), with the timberline at about 4,000 m. The rainy season starts in May and lasts until October (Lauer and Frankenberg 1978:72, 124, Table IV). The highest annual temperature occurs in April, the onset of the rainy season, and the lowest in December-January. Some 500 years ago weather conditions were slightly more severe (Lauer 1979), but the best time to climb the mountain was practically the same as today: October through December, and February until the beginning of May. The date of the feast of Huey Tozotli celebrated atop Mount Tlaloc coincided with a period of the highest annual temperature, shortly before dangerous thunderstorms might block access to the summit. Archaeological Investigations The first detailed account of Mount Tlaloc by Rickards (1929) was followed by visits or descriptions by other scholars (Caso 1932:237; Martinez del Rio 1934:299; Noguera 1940:38). In 1953 Wicke and Horcasitas (1957) carried out preliminary archaeological investigations at the site; their con- clusions were repeated by Parsons (1971). Archaeoastronomical research begun in 1984, some of which remains unpublished, includes work by Aveni (Aveni et al. 1988), Broda (1989, l991a), Ponce de Leon (1991), Sprajc, and the present author. In 1989 excavation was undertaken at the site by Solis and Townsend (Townsend 1991). Ethnohistorical Sources The Name of the Mountain. According to sixteenth-century sources the mountain was considered to be Tlaloc's sacred seat ("Tlalocan") or was identified with the god himself. The references are either to the Mountain of Tlalocan ("Sierra de Tlaloca, Sierra de Tlalocan, Tlalocatepetl") (de Torquemada 1975:I:358; Duran 1971:155; Munoz Camargo 1986:103, 145; Proceso inquisitorial [PI1 1980: 17-18,20,22,26), or to Mount Tlaloc ("Cerro/Monte Tlaloc, Sierras/Serrania de Tlaloc") (de Torquemada 1976:III:77; Ixtlilxochitl 1975a:294, 377, 1975b:429; PI 1980:21; Relacion de Tetzvoco [Rll 1986:60, 100, 102, 108). Poyauhtecatl,"he who dwells in smoky clouds," identified by Wicke and Horcasitas as the other (and older) name of Mount Tlaloc, in fact denotes Pico de Orizaba or even Cofre de Perote, and also appears to be associated with a locale south of Tetzcoco, between Coatlinchan and Chimal- huacan, at the bank of Lake Tetzcoco. Under the Aztecs in a small, ayauhcalli-type temple ("House of Clouds"), children were offered in honor of Tlaloc during the Atlcahualo (12 February-3 March) ceremonies (de Sahagun 1979:99). Ethnohistorical Descriptions of the Site. According to some accounts (de Torquemada 1975:I: 358; Dibble 1980:Plate 1 [sixteenth century]; Ixtlilxochitl 1975a:294; Munoz Camargo 1986:145- 146), Mount Tlaloc was visited by some pre-Aztec rulers for strategic reasons because it offered excellent views of the valleys of Puebla and Mexico. The most important elements of ethnohistorical accounts are, however, descriptions of the ritual place atop the mountain, which speak of a statue of Tlaloc placed in a ritual precinct described as a "temple." Some accounts describe the statue as an anthropomorphic figure seated on a square slab (e.g., de Torquemada 1976:III:77-78; Ixtlilxochitl 1975c:273; PI 1980:22; RT 1986:60-61). Only Duran (1971: 154-171) gives a detailed description of the sacred precinct as a huge square courtyard called tetzacualo ("place enclosed by stones"), surrounded by a wall 1.5 estados (= 10.5 Spanish feet [Real Academia Espanola 1970:578], or 2.94 m) high. On one side of the courtyard (unfortunately Duran does not note the world direction here) stood a structure covered with a wooden roof. Inside, on a small platform, sat a statue of Tlaloc, surrounded by a number of smaller idols representing other mountains and cliis in the vicinity of Mount Tlaloc. Houses used as shelters during the feast were arranged around the great courtyard and the rest of the summit. The yearly feast celebrated on the ninth of May, or at the end of the month of Huey Tozoztli, coincided with the time of maize sprouting prior to the onset of the rainy season (de las Casas 1979: 86; Motolinia 1984:35; RT 1986:63). It appears that no other ceremonies were performed on the mountaintop.</page><page sequence="4">161 lwaniszewskil ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOASTRONOMYOFMOUNTTLALOC ' Ce :w b+^&gt;;f E Rs Figure 2. View from the southwest side of Ccrro Tlaloc at timberline toward its summit. Obscrvc rocky outcroppings formed in terraces and isolated P. hartwegEi trees. According to Duran (1971:156-158), in addition to Motecuhzoma II, the ruler of Tenochtitlan, other lords and nobles attended the solemn feast. Mentioned are the rulers of Tetzcoco, Xochimilco, Tlacopan, Tlaxcala and Huexotzinco, and other places (see Figure 1). The PI (1980:21) enumerates a slightly distinct set of places: Tenochtitlan, Tetzcoco, Chalco, Huexotzinco, Cholula, and Tlaxcala. The fact that polities from both sides of the Sierra Nevada are mentioned may be significant, because from the second half of the fifteenth century through the mid-sixteenth century the political centers of the Valley of Puebla were at war with the Aztecs. The role of the Tlaloc shrine in the enmity between the two valleys is reflected in the sources. The PI (1980:22) states that on one occasion the Huexotzincas destroyed the statue of Tlaloc in order to i'make those from Mexico (i.e., Tenochtitlan) angry.7' A group of soldiers was left after the ceremony to protect the offerings from being plundered and stolen by those from Huexotzinco and Tlaxcala (Duran 1971:159). It seems that the most solemn feasts were attended by the rulers from enemy states who jointly performed rituals; the fact that the rulers from both valleys attended the annual feast means that the mountain sanctuary was significant to both sides. In spite of some inconsistency among the sources they all suggest that Mount Tlaloc was visited long before the Tlaloc sanctuary was built. They also seem to indicate that some major rearrangement of the zone took place at the turn of the sixteenth century. STRUCTURES AT THE SUMMIT-PRESENT STATE Because the summit is surrounded by steep slopes on three sides, the easiest access is from the west. Early reports place the path at the north or northwest (Parsons 1971 :Figure 34; Rickards 1929: Figure 13; Wicke and Horcasitas 1957:Figure 41), but as more recent authors (Aveni et al 1988: 301; Townsend 1991:27) have noted, a pathway bordered by two parallel stone walls, now partly collapsed, enters the precinct from the west. Its average length is 150.05 m along the exterior walls and 152.30 m from the entrance to the inner wall of the precinct. Although the walls are covered with collapse debris, the construction is still well preserved to a height of 1.30-1.70 m. The average wall thickness is 2.30 m and the pathway's average azimuth is 281°30' as viewed from the precinct westward. At the summit stands a rectangular double-walled stone enclosure, its exterior wall connected with the pathway. Its exterior dimensions are approximately 60 x 50 m, with the longer sides at east and west. The average thickness of the enclosure walls is 2.35 m. The present height of the walls varies in reflection of topographic features and it appears that the builders placed more stones in lower spots in order to maintain an equal height. A second rectangular enclosure inside the first, has average exterior dimensions of ca. 47 x 34 m and walls about 1.5 m thick. Natural outcrops form lower parts of the inner wall. The amount of collapse debris suggests that the inner enclosure was lower, though a good part of the material has been used to build a modern shrine. The partially destroyed walls do not follow strictly straight lines. Their azimuths (see Table 1), which were calculated from the site plan, should be treated as</page><page sequence="5">Wall Direction Azimuth Exterior E 1°30'-2°30' N 94°-95°S' W 2°30'4° S 96°-97°30' Interior E cannot be established N 90°30'-9 1° W 2°30'-5° S 96°30'-97°30' Horizon Sun Sunrise Direction to Azimuth Elevation Declination Dates Pico de Orizaba 105°22' 0°02' - 14°29' 10.02./1* 1 1.

Average Azimuths of the Sacred Enclosure at Mount Tlaloc. rough approximations. Only a part of the south exterior wall was measured with a theodolite; its value is given in Table 2. Measurements indicate that the south side of the exterior enclosure was skewed 2-3° south of east. The interior structure seems to have been roughly trapeziform, with its western, southern, and perhaps eastern sides roughly parallel to the respective walls of the exterior rectangle and its northern wall skewed ca. 3° to the north with respect to the corresponding exterior wall. The pathway is skewed ca. 8° from the western exterior wall. In the eastern part of the site, between the interior and exterior walls, lies a roughly rectangular pit cut out of the bedrock with average dimensions of 2.24 x .99 m. When I climbed Mount Tlaloc in October 1984 it was filled with water, but on later ascents made during the dry season it remained empty. The pit's use as a water reservoir can be discounted (see Wicke and Horcasitas 1957:88), with the result that the site's water supply is presently not identifiable. The layout of construction in the vicinity produces the impression that the pit was near or inside a rectangular structure. Perhaps it was the cave where a sacrificed child was left (de las Casas 1979:86; RT 1986:63). A modeln shrine in the center (see Figure 3) and six wooden crosses inserted into a wall in different places testify to current ceremonies. TWO CONSTRUCTION PHASES AT MOUNT TLALOC? The material used for building activities at Mount Tlaloc comes from the vicinity and consists of pumice and tufa stones that are relatively easily dressed. The inner wall is thinner than the exterior, but its average stone dimensions are greater, and its width ranges from one to three blocks, usually dressed only on the outer surface, which is smooth and flat (Figure 4). The outer walls and the pathway are built of smaller stones. Whereas the interior face of the wall is composed of irregular stones, the exterior stones have been smoothed to produce a flat surface (Figure 5). The amount of collapse debris around the walls indicates an original height of about 3 Table 2.

Construction details of the inner enclosure. m, twice the present figure. This agrees fairly closely with Duran's statement. The fact that fallen material is not widely dispersed suggests that the wall collapse was caused by human activities rather than by natural agents. I propose that the walls were partly demolished by Zumarraga's time, and that the accumulation of material abutting both sides of the wall prevented further destruction. As the site's plan (Figure 3) shows? the mean distance between the outer and inner walls is similar on the west and east sides. The north sides are not parallel, and the south ones seem to converge. In addition, the geometric centers of the two enclosures do not overlap (see Figure 6). In my opinion these features combine with the differences in construction technique to suggest a sequence of building phases. If the two enclosures had been built at the same time, the inner structure would have been situated farther north in order to provide more space for the skewed rectangle. I suggest that the inner structure was built during the first construction phase and that later the builders of the outer structure lacked enough space on the south side to proceed with their work. The steepness of the slope here may have forced the builders to change the original layout by merging the two walls. Because the construction techniques of the pathway and the exterior enclosure are similar and the two features are directly connected? I suggest that they represent a single building phase. It therefore Figure 5. Fragment of the exterior enclosure.</page><page sequence="8">Iwaniszewski] ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOASTRONOMYOF MOUNTTLALOC 165 Figure 6. Central part of the architectural complex atop Cerro Tlaloc. Layout differences emphasized by two circles passing through the corners of the inner and outer enclosures. appears that the inner enclosure was a roughly rectangular or trapeziform structure without an access pathway, whereas the outer one consisted of another skewed rectangle with a pathway attached. CHRONOLOGY OF THE SITE Wicke and Horcasitas (1957:90) report that they excavated a l-m2 sounding in order to sample the site's stratigraphy, but subsequent illegal digging prevents identification of their excavations. The site surface is covered by numerous ceramic sherds, obsidian blades and flakes, and green-stone fragments. Judging from the surface material, Late Toltec and earlier Late Aztec (Vaillant's Aztec II and III) pottery predominates. Both Wicke and Horcasitas (1957:90, 93) and Parsons (1971:151) suggest that remains from earlier periods are likely to exist. Recent archaeological investigations by Solis and Townsend revealed isolated sherds from the Formative, Classic (= Teotihuacan), Late Toltec (A.D. 950-1150), and Early Aztec (A.D. 1150-1350) periods, but Townsend (1991:28-29) states that about 80 percent of the surface pottery is of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century date, and corresponds to Vaillant's Aztec III and IV types. He concludes that the site might have been used for ritual purposes from the beginning of the Christian era until the end of Mexica rule, and he dates the construction of the ceremonial precinct to the fifteenth century. Mount Tlaloc cannot be considered in isolation from other high mountain ceremonial sites. Data published by Parsons et al. (1983) show that a number of such sites were reinstated in use after a period of abandonment, and hence it is possible that the ceremonial site at Mount Tlaloc was used at different times separated by periods of discontinuity. The Late Toltec date for the rough, rect- angular enclosures on the Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl slopes (Lorenzo 1957) indicates the earliest possible date for the building of the Mount Tlaloc inner structure. The outer enclosure with a</page><page sequence="9">166 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 5, No. 2, 1994 pathway resembles the planning scheme of the ruins at Mount Zacatepetl, in the southern Basin of Mexico (see maps in Martinez del Rio 1934:299; Noguera 1940:Plan 1; Parsons et al. 1982:Figure 39). The ruins at Mount Zacatepetl are dated to the end of the fifteenth century (Noguera 1940: 17), although Parsons et al. (1982:237) state that the site has yielded both Early and Late Aztec (ca. A.D. 1150-1520) surface pottery. This suggests that the site was used in both periods, and was converted into a place for hunting rituals by the end of the fifteenth century. Architectural details are not clearly discernible in the published photographs, and hence it is impossible to determine whether the Mount Zacatepetl structure was built in the same way as the Mount Tlaloc outer enclosure. In any event, the ethnohistorical, archaeological, and architectural data combine to suggest that the last Prehispanic modification of the Mount Tlaloc sanctuary took place at the end of the fifteenth century. I suggest that this date refers to the construction ofthe rectangular enclosure and its pathway. A modern shrine in the center of the site was probably built in the early 1970s, because all authors failed to report its presence and it does not appear in the aerial photograph published by Wicke and Horcasitas (1957). ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ARCHITECTURE ON MOUNT TLALOC Aveni et al. (1988), and to some extent Broda (1989), analyzed the Mount Tlaloc sanctuary as viewed from Tenochtitlan. According to Aztec beliefs Tlalocan is situated in the east, and Mount Tlaloc lies east of the center of Tenochtitlan at the sanctuary of the Templo Mayor. Both enclosures atop Mount Tlaloc are, however, oriented to the east. It is also important to note that some colonial accounts (e.g., Pomar [see RT 1986:60] and de Torquemada [1976:III:78]) state that the statue of Tlaloc "looked toward the east," i.e., toward the Valley of Puebla. In this section I shall explore the eastern horizon as seen from Mount Tlaloc. Two prominent mountains, one behind the other, rise over the eastern horizon (see Figure 7). They are La Malinche (ancient Matlalcueye, 4,461 m) and Pico de Orizaba (ancient Citlaltepetl or Poyauhtlan, 5,700 m). The two are of similar size and nearly the same form, with two different elevations, the higher of the two at the left (north). Both the view and astronomical direction may be of importance. Mount Tlaloc is the only elevation from which the two mountains may be perceived as standing one behind the other. The alignments between Mount Tlaloc and the cluster of La MalincheXitlaltepetl have bearings of 105-107° (Table 2, Figure 7). This orientation pattern appears in a great number of Mexican highland sites, as Aveni and Gibbs (1976) have demonstrated. Teotihuacan is believed to be the place from which this alignment scheme later expanded. The orientation was undoubtedly meaningful to the inhabitants of central Mexico, and this is very likely to have led the builders to establish Mount Tlaloc as a sacred place. Mount Tlaloc and La Malinche. Solar Calendar, Religion, and Ecological Considerations First, the three mountains involved here bear high-altitude sanctuaries. On Mount Tlaloc and La Malinche the rain and water deities were worshipped; the character of the lone small sanctuary identified to date on Pico de Orizaba (Iwaniszewski 1986a:260) has not yet been defined. Matlalcueye was worshipped at the summit of La Malinche (de las Casas 1979:89,110; de Tor- quemada 1975:I:379, 1976:III:78-79, 413-414; Motolinia 1971:246). The sanctuary, situated over the treeline on an ancient crater of Tlaloca(n), has been reported by Hobgood in Horcasitas's and Heyden's (1971:466) commentary on Duran and by Werner (1976:9). Provisionally dated to the Postclassic, the sanctuary is visible from Mount Tlaloc. The visual line that appears to link Mount Tlaloc with La Malinche recalls a Tlaxcalan myth of Tlaloc and his two divine consorts, Xochiquetzal and Matlalcueye. In the myth Xochiquetzal, Tlaloc's spouse, is stolen by Tezcatlipoca and replaced by Matlalcueye (de Torquemada 1976:III: 79; RT 1984:203). Both Xochiquetzal and Matlalcueye were associated with water (de Torquemada 1976:III:79,416; Motolinia 1971:246, 1984:185). Whereas Tlaloc was worshipped in Tenochtitlan, Matlalcueye was venerated in the region of Tlaxcala. Second, the sun rises over La Malinche/Pico de Orizaba peaks on February 9 and 10 and again,</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOASTRONOMY OF MOUNTTLALOC 167 Iwaniszewski] +1° - SUNRISE l l 0o PicodeOrizalgMalinche FEB3 .

Fragment of the eastern horizon with the peaks of La Malinche and Pico de Orizaba viewed from the summit of Cerro Tlaloc. after 264 to 266 days, on November 1 and 2 (Table 2, Figure 7). The dates marked by this alignment agree with the orientations observed at Teotihuacan (Dow 1967; Drucker 1977; Iwaniszewski 1991) and elsewhere, which were considered significant well before the mountain sanctuary was built. In Aztec times they were related to calendrical feasts involving mountains, e.g., Matlalcueye and Xochiquetzal. Duran (1971:466) reports on the Matlalcueye and Tlaloc ceremony performed in the eighteenth month of Izcalli (January 18-February 6). Motolinia (1984:44) and de Torquemada (1976:III:413) maintain, however, that the Camaxtle and Matlalcueye feast celebrated in the shrine of the goddess at La Malinche took place at the beginning of March. Her name also denotes one of the victims sacrificed to the mountain gods during the feast of Tepeilhuitl on October 10-29 (see de Sahagun 1979:88-89, 138; de Torquemada 1976:III:402). The sources regarding Xochiquetzal are in closer agreement. The Codex Magliabechiano (Boone 1983: 197), the Tovar Calendar (Kubler andGibsonl951:31,Platell),theCodexTelleriano-RemensisI(AntiguedadesdeMexicol964: 164-165), and de Torquemada (1976:III:427) all place the goddess's principal feast in the thirteenth month of Tepeilhuitl, the same time dedicated to the mountain gods. Other accounts put the feast in the preceding Teotleco month (Duran 1971:240) or the following Quecholli month (e.g., de Torquemada 1976:III:427). Duran (1971:240) gives exact dates for the goddess's feasts of October 16 and November 5. In any event, the last day of Tepeilhuitl always falls in October (see de Sahagun [1979:77-155] and the reconstructions by Carrasco [1976], Graulich [1982], and Tichy [1980]). It appears that the main Matlalcueye feast occurred at the end of January (Duran) and/or at the beginning of March (other sources), and that she was also venerated in October (per de Sahagun and de Torquemada). The principal Xochiquetzal ceremony was celebrated in October or November. According to Duran and the calendrical correlation used throughout this paper, the feasts of Ma- tlalcueye and Xochiquetzal would take place on February 6 and October 29, respectively. These dates come very close to those observed from Mount Tlaloc. The azimuths of southern walls of both enclosures point to the sunrise position on March 1 and October 13, that is, 20 days later/earlier in respect to La Malinche/Pico de Orizaba dates. These dates are 20 days apart from the equinoxes. The orientation of the northern interior wall, between 90.5 and 91°, very closely approximates the equinox sunrise, which means that this date was encoded in the structure's orientation. This evidence, added to the data in Aveni et al. (1988) and Aveni (1991:67), may support the idea that at Mount Tlaloc the equinoxes were pivotal points in the horizon calendar. Third, the average orientation of the southern wall of the Mount Tlaloc precinct (azimuth 96- 97.5°) matches that ofthe Templo Mayor (ca. 96°42' + 23'; see Aveni et al. 1988:Table 2). As a</page><page sequence="11">168 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 5, No. 2, 1994 result of diffierent horizon elevations the dates of the sunrises defined by those orientations do not coincide; they are March l/October 13 at Mount Tlaloc and March 9/October 6 (?) at the Templo Mayor. The dates of March l/October 14 (?) are, however, also marked at Templo Mayor. They refer to the sunrise over Mount Telapon (Aveni et al. 1988:302). The alignments of the rectangular enclosure atop Mount Tlaloc do not appear to be related to the Templo Mayor. The northern and southern walls of both enclosures at Mount Tlaloc do not point toward the Templo Mayor, as Aveni et al. (1988:301) contend. The authors assumed that the northern and southern walls of the precinct were exactly perpendicular to the western one; having established that the pathway (azimuth = 281°30') was skewed 8° from the western wall, they simply calculated (281°30'-8° = 273°30' with the reciprocal 93°30'), and compared with their Figure 5. This error was repeated by Broda (199lb:92, 114). Mount Tepetzinco (today's Penon de los Banos) seems to be a better candidate in terms of alignments with Mount Tlaloc (see Figure 8). The Mount Tepetzinco-Mount Tlaloc axis bears 94.5° (Tichy 1 983:Figure 4, 1991 :Figure 2) which is still ca. 2-3° of the precinct orientation of 96-97.5°. Mount Tepetzinco's importance for orientation purposes has been discussed by other authors (Aveni 1991; Aveni et al. 1988; Broda l991b; Tichy 1983, 1991). Its significance rests on its identification as the place where Copil, the Aztec opponent, was slain in combat. He was decapitated, his head was buried at the summit, and his heart was thrown to the place where later the Templo Mayor was erected (Aveni et al. 1988:291-292). Fourth, the western and eastern walls are skewed from the north by 1.5-5° (see Table 1). This orientation, if extended northward, points to Mount Tlamacas (Tichy 1983:Figure 4, repeated in Tichy 1991 :Figure 2). The position of the Mount Tlalo&gt;Mount Tlamacas line perpendicular to the Mount Tlaloc-Tepetzinco axis (see Figure 8) may not be accidental. Fifth, the orientation of the pathway points to the place of the sunset on April 18, which is 21 days from May 9, the date of the Huey Tozoztli feast celebrated on Mount Tlaloc cited by Duran, as discussed by Aveni et al. (1988:301). Broda (199lb:92, Table 7.2) reports that extension ofthis axis westward points to Tepeyac and Yoaltecatl, both peaks that were involved in the rain-related ceremonies during Atlcahualo (February 12-March 3). This reinforces the probability that the pathway was intentionally misaligned. Table 3 presents a set of following dates based on the possible orientations of the Mount Tlaloc sanctuary. The dates appear to be spaced at regular 20-day intervals, but the scheme is interrupted when the dates of the pathway are considered. In light of the previous discussion it seems that a set of dates February 9-March l-March 21 was established when the inner enclosure was built and the later addition of the pathway replaced and/or complemented the set with the April 18 system. Sixth, the relevance of sunrises over the smaller peak of Pico de Orizaba (IInd) should also be considered (see Figure 7). The sun rises over the mountain six days before/after it appears over La Malinche. No calendrical name containing the count of six days can be linked to Tlaloc (Caso 1967; Klein 1980), but the count recalls a description of his statue placed on Mount Tlaloc with the forehead adorned with a chalchikuitl (green stone) bearing the count of six days (PI 1980:23). Because we can insert other Mount Tlaloc dates into the Aztec calendar, it is possible that this six-day interval can also be fixed at a specific place in the solar year. But we know only of the five- day interval. The five nemontemi ("meaningless") days were added at the end ofthe 360-day period made up of 18 months of 20 days, just after Izcalli and before Atlcahualo (see Tena 1987:50-52). In the scheme by Tichy the nemontemi days fall on February 7-February 11, close to the dates of the sunrises over Pico de Orizaba (IInd) and La Malinche (February 3-8). Moreover, Tlaloc may be connected to the nemontemi days; for example, the god and the days are portrayed on the same page of Codex Magliabechiano 92r (see Caso 1967:36, Figure 14). The days are depicted as if they were the images of the tepictoton (mountain gods). The days's affinities with the mountain, water, and fertility gods are noted by Tena (1987:66-67), who follows Broda's (1969) earlier conclusions</page><page sequence="12"> Iwaniszewski] ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOASTRONOMY OF MOUNT TLALOC 169 os os - * ;F oo oo - * - o q q ;Y q o ;Y - o Ez c Ez q a *Y C) Ez o * q q o O t C X, 0s * _ 00 ;&gt;% i C) !l *- ua Ez * s u Z g g ,, I * I W-i -F</page><page sequence="13">+ 20d + 20d + 28d + 21d Feb 9 Mar 1 Mar 21 Apr 18 May 9 and Nov 2 Oct 13 Sep 23 Aug 26 Aug S 170 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 5, No. 2, 1994 Table 3. Framework of Dates Associated with Solar Dates at Mount Tlaloc. regarding the meteorological prognostic value of the nemontemi days with respect to the coming year. Weather forecasting may be related to the observation of the behavior of the confluent zone that associates Mount Tlaloc with the La Malinche-Pico de Orizaba complex (see Figure 9). The confluent zone, where the valley and upslope lower wind currents meet with the air current from the north marks a barrier between the Pacific and Atlantic air streams. Although the zone shifts frequently to the north or south, depending on weather conditions during the year, it is always linked to the three mountains (Lauer and Klaus 1975:Figure 1). Since the zone is characterized by cloudiness, it may be considered metaphorically as Tlalocan, a place where clouds, especially stratocumulus, are produced and where during the rainy season the heaviest precipitation (Lauer and Frankenberg 1978:37) and thunderstorms (Lauer and Klaus 1975:362) occur. The formation of clouds may be reflected in the ancient name of Pico de Orizaba, which is Poyauhtecatl ("He who dwells among the fog"). On the other hand, Mount Tlaloc (= Tlalocan) and La Malinche were traditionally considered as the places where the clouds were formed and gathered (e.g., Duran 1971:155-156; Motolinia 1984:184). Because adequate temperature and humidity are required for the cultivation of maize, a staple associated with Tlaloc, the process cannot be initiated too early nor too late, and there is special danger in the combination of late rains and premature frosts. A keen observer situated at the summit of Mount Tlaloc and looking at the direction of La Malinche-Pico de Orizaba could notice the southern shifts of the confluence belt clouds during the period of weather transition (April-June) and thus anticipate the arrival of the rainy season (consult Figure 9). It is noteworthy that Mount Tlaloc was climbed in order to look eastward (e.g., Ixtlilxochitl 1975a:294). For divinatory purposes the most important agricultural activities had to be correlated with the proper feast. De Sahagun (1979:99) comments that during Atlcahualo (February 12-March 3) the Figure 9. Map of the eastern Mexican Highlands with a confluent zone inserted according to Lauer and Klaus (1975:Figure 1).</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOASTRONOMY OF MOUNT TLALOC 171 Iwaniszewski] Figure 10. Map of the territory extending eastward viewed from Mount Tlaloc. Azimuths toward La Malinche and Mount Xochitecatl are shown. Aztecs forecast the coming of rains and frosts by observing birds. Montero Garcia (1988) suggests that visiting the high mountain sanctuaries could have helped in predicting weather conditions in advance. This in turn could have allowed determination of the most efficient agricultural strategy for the following months. The dates of February 9-10, May 9, and November 1-2 seem to correspond to three important Aztec feasts (Atlcahualo, Huey Tozoztli, and Tepeilhuitl) associated with the start of the agricultural year, time of planting, and harvesting, respectively, and may denote the span of the cultivation year (see discussions in Broda [1983]; Iwaniszewski [1991]; and Tichy [1980, 1985]). Seventh, another interesting orientation links Mount Tlaloc with Mount Xochitecatl situated in the Valley of Puebla. The winter solstice sunrise (December 22) occurs precisely over Mount Xoch- itecatl when observed from Mount Tlaloc (see Figure 10). This date corresponds to the month of Atemoztli (December 9-28), which was another month dedicated to Tlaloc, mountain gods and rain-bringing ceremonies, according to the Codex Magliabechano (Boone 1983: 198-199), Duran (1971:461-462), Primeros memoriales de Fray Bernadino de Sahagun [PM1 (Jimenez Moreno 1974: 58-59), de Sahagun (1979:91-92, 147-148), and the Tovar Calendar (Kubler and Gibson 1951 :33, Plate 12). The importance of Mount Xochitecatl for a Cholulan ceremonial landscape is discussed by Tichy (1974a:201-202, 1974b:44) as part of a hypothesis concerning the ceremonial alignments in a central part of the Valley of Puebla. A local system of orientations centered at the Mount Centepec linked important peaks to mountain and rain ceremonies (see Figure 8). The names of three of the mountains involved-Tepexuchitl, Matlalcueye, and Xochitecatl-appear as the names of the victims sacrificed to the mountain gods during the feast of Tepeilhuitl (October 1s29) (see de Sahagun 1979:88-89, 138; de Torquemada 1976:III:402). The name of Xochitecatl ("He of the Flowery Place") exhibits some similarity with that of Xochiquetzal, and de Torquemada (1976:III: 427) notes that both Xochiquetzal and Xochitecatl were venerated during the month of Quecholli (October 3ONovember 18). Mount Tlaloc and Cosmovision In the mesoamerican cosmovision the earth's surface was conceived as divided into four quarters. Any four-sided ceremonial structure could therefore be seen as a replica of a quadripartite universe.</page><page sequence="15">172 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 5, No. 2, 1994 Figure ll. Mountain sanctuary according to Primeros Memoriales Illustration l-l (Jimenez Moreno 1974). Other high-mountain sanctuaries located at Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl slopes (see Iwaniszewski 1986b; Lorenzo 1957) display the same, roughly rectangular layout paradigm as does the Mount Tlaloc structure. Townsend's (1991) previously discussed interpretation ofthe layout unfortunately relies on illustrations that refer to temporal cycles associated with Tlaloc and Tlaloque and not to the spatial arrangement (Seler 1963). Although in the mesoamerican cosmovision temporal cycles were inserted in the quartered space, it is difficult to interpret the Codex Borgia representations as images of a sanctuary; the illustrations in the PM should instead be considered here. For example, PM Illustration 1-1 (see Figure 11) represents a rectangular structure located atop the mountain glyph, with three Tlaloque images placed inside. It appears that a rough rectangle was the usual form of a high-mountain sanctuary associated with the Tlaloc cult. Illustrations 1-1, 1-4, and 3-14 from the PM demonstrate that the images of the Tlaloque were placed inside sanctuaries. Probably the best archaeological example of such an arrangement is Nahualac (Iwaniszewski 1986a; Lorenzo 1957). The layout of the modern site of Coapotzaltzin (Mount Ehecatl, Petlacala, Guerrero), where rain ceremonies are held, demonstrates (see Iwaniszewski 1986b, 1992) that piles of stones are placed on visual lines linking the mountain on a horizon with the central point of the sanctuary. This arrangement may be represented at Nahualac. It therefore seems probable that instead of Tlaloque images at the intercardinal points, the Aztecs placed around the sanctuary images of the gods of clifEs and mountains situated around Mount Tlaloc, as Duran states. Such figures could have rep- resented the landscape forms visible from the central point of Mount Tlaloc, and hence would not have coincided with intercardinal directions. CONCLUSIONS Exploration of the possible alignments of Mount Tlaloc with the eastern horizon has revealed the Mount Tlalo&gt;La Malinche/Pico de Orizaba and Mount Tlaloc-Mount Xochitecatl orientations. These alignments correlate with sunrise on dates when calendrical rituals were performed in sanc- tuaries placed atop sacred mountains. The visual lines that connect Mount Tlaloc with the moun- taintops on the eastern horizon reaffirm the idea that Mount Tlaloc was intentionally chosen to permit such sunrise observations. On the other hand, the Mount Tlalo&gt;Tepeyac/Yoaltecatl align- ment appears to be the best possibility for westward orientations because those mountains were also associated with rain-bringing mountain ceremonies. In this way, Mount Tlaloc and other peaks formed part of a sacred landscape based on calendric-astronomical alignments that existed between</page><page sequence="16">Iwaniszewski] ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOASTRONOMY OF MOUNT TLALOC 173 the important mountains and ceremonial centers in the valleys of Puebla and Mexico. This reinforces Tichy's and Broda's concepts of sacred geography. The aforementioned evidence, plus the existence of high-mountain ceremonial enclosures with other calendrical alignments (Iwaniszewski 1986b; Montero Garcia 1988; Ponce de Leon 1991), supports the idea proposed by Tichy and Aveni that Mesoamericans utilized a horizon-orientation calendar. On Mount Tlaloc it could have consisted of 20-day markers placed on the skyline as seen from the mountaintop. Mount Tlaloc dates can be inserted into a framework of dates indicated by the Templo Mayor alignments (Aveni et al. 1988). Thus, the Mount Tlaloc dates Febmary 9-March l-March 21 are compatible with the Templo Mayor set of March l-March 21. Both sets of dates are anchored on an equinox date. It also appears that Mount Tlaloc itself might have been part of the eastein horizon sunrise observations taken from several ceremonial centers in the Basin of Mexico. The Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan should be viewed as only one, and perhaps not the most important one, of such ceremonial centers. The sunrise sightings from the Templo Mayor over Mount Tlaloc or vice versa seem to be of minor calendric importance. Acknowledgments. Many discussions with Matthew Wallrath stimulated my research at Mount Tlaloc and other high mountains in Mexico. I owe much to my companions, Arturo Ponce de Leon, Ivan Sprajc, Arturo Montero Garcia, and Antonio Siller, without whom the fieldwork would not have been possible. Preliminary fieldwork results were presented and discussed at the 1988 Mexico City meeting on cross-circle designs, and I am indebted to Anthony F. Aveni, the late Horst Hartung, and William Murray for their suggestions at that time. Figure 3 was drawn in 1987 by the author and Ivan Sprajc. Parts of the conclusions were also presented in 1990 at a seminar at Warsaw University, and I gratefully acknowledge discussions with Andrzej Wiercinski and Elzbieta Siarkiewicz. The fieldwork was made possible by the generous support of the Instituto de Inves- tigaciones Antropologicas, Division de Estudios Profesionales y del Posgrado del Colegio de Ciencias y Hu- manidades, and the Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico at the Universidad Nacional Au- tonoma de Mexico. I also thank Joaquin Garcia Barcena and the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia for all the permits necessary to conduct the fieldwork. I acknowledge, finally, the very helpful comments of three anonymous referees. REFERENCES CITED Antiguedades de AIexico 1964 Antiguedades de Mexico basadas en la recopilacion de Lord Kingsborough.
