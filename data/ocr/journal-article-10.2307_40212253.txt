<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE Cognitive Conceptualism - Where Have All the Affects Gone? Additional Corrections for Barrett et al. (2007) Jaak Panksepp Department of Veterinary Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, &amp; Pharmacology, Washington State University ABSTRACT- Barrett et al. (2007) claim that their approach to emotions covers more of the available evidence than does my affective neuroscience approach (Panksepp, 2007b). In fact, the weight of neurological evidence indicates that raw affect, as monitored by many behavioral tasks, is an aspect of the arousal of instinctual-emotional networks. This provides an empirical approach to understanding how primary-process emotional feelings are constituted by neural activities (Panksepp, 2008). There is abundant evidence for the existence of a variety of primal emotions shared across mammalian species that are biologically ingrained tools for living and learning and that may allow higher brain regions to conceptualize what is really im- portant in the world. Barrett et al., misrepresent my views; an accurate depiction of them can be found in this article and in Gallagher (2008). Abundant cross-species evidence of basic affective systems exists to enrich cog- nitive-conceptual and attributional theories of human emotions. Barrett's (2006) conceptual "wholes" need evidence-based, neuro-evolutionary "parts." Her critique (Barrett et al., 2007) of my commentary (Panksepp, 2007b) sought to deconstruct affective neuroscience facts and perspectives rather than so- lidify her own project. However, she failed to counter behavioral and neurochemical evidence for varieties of positive and neg- ative affects arising from subcortical emotional and motivational systems. She failed to explain why localized stimulation of mesencephalic and diencephalic sites that arouse coherent emotional action patterns also generate feelings as monitored by various instrumental tasks (conditioned place preferences and aversions). The following points were misrepresentations. 1. Barrett incorrectly suggests that Valenstein's intriguing findings contradict my position. In fact, Valenstein's discovery of behavioral, but not affective, plasticity within hypothalamic self-stimulation "reward" regions was consistent with my con- tiguous work on predatory aggression from those sites (Pank- sepp, 1971). However, I reconceptualized those findings into a general-purpose foraging/SEEKING/expectancy system (Pank- sepp, 1998). My view eventually prevailed because the reward regions did not intensify objective pleasure indices as predicted (Berridge &amp; Valenstein, 1991). Those unexpected findings eventually led Berridge (2007) to the "wanting" concept, a variant of our earlier SEEKING/expectancy urge (for history, see Alcaro, Huber, &amp; Panksepp, 2007; Ikemoto &amp; Panksepp, 1999; Panksepp &amp; Moskal, 2008). 2. Barrett asserts that dopamine does not consistently mediate positive affect. We have explicitly highlighted that stressor- induced dopamine release may facilitate the seeking of safety in dangerous situations (Ikemoto &amp; Panksepp, 1999). This does not necessarily mean that dopamine mediates negative affect. SEEKING urges may be aroused by negative emotions. 3. Barrett suggests I advocate an "orderly and progressive phylogentic scale" (p. 303). I adhere to no 19th century con- ceptions of linear, hierarchical evolution (Panksepp, 2007a). Variation and diversification are abundantly evident in the de- tails of all brain-body systems, but genetic homologies across vertebrates are strikingly abundant. The late Paul MacLean's (1913-2007) limbic view of emotional integration (MacLean, 1990) has been affirmed by modern brain imaging. Although his triune-brain metaphor is a didactic simplification, his scientific contributions deserve careful and sympathetic reading (Pank- sepp, 2002). 4. Barrett suggests I advocate modular views of brain orga- nization. I do not. I have consistently criticized misleading "modularity" metaphors (Panksepp, 2007a), advocating de- ployment of real neuroscience concepts (complex, interactive Address correspondence to Jaak Panksepp, Baily Endowed Chair of Animal Weil-Being Science, Department of Veterinary Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, &amp; Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Med- icine, Washington State University, P.O.

(2007) neural networks and their chemistries) to discuss evolutionarily molded brain-mind functions. Dubious modularity hypotheses arose from social-personality variants of evolutionary psychol- ogy that ignore cross-species neurobiological evidence (Pank- sepp, Moskal, Panksepp, &amp; Kroes, 2002). No evidence for genetically prescribed modularity exists within the neonatal neocortices of any mammal. Adult neocortical specializations emerge developmentally and epigenetically (e.g., Sur &amp; Rubenstein, 2005). Likewise "conceptual acts" surely arise developmentally, perhaps from self-related information pro- cessing within cortical-subcortical midline emotional systems (Northoff &amp; Panksepp, in press; Panksepp &amp; Northoff, in press). 5. Barrett asserts "it is important" to be "clear about whether a citation is a conceptual analysis or an empirical one" (p. 305). She then claims I misrepresented Denton's (2006) brain imaging of "motivational-homeostatic" processes as being relevant to "emotion," even though I explicitly stated, "I do not agree with such conflations" (pp. 282, 286). By failing to clarify how homeostatic negative affects - air-hunger, food-hunger, thirst, etc. - might emerge from conceptual acts, Barrett ignored evi- dence for multiple, subcortically engendered affective processes. 6. Barrett (2007) reasserts that brain stimulation-evoked emotional states are just behaviors and nothing more. Repeating this does not make it so. She sidesteps a massive database showing that animals uniformly approach or avoid such sub- cortical brain stimulations. She explicitly accepts the existence of instinctual, emotional networks, but doubts that they con- tribute to multiple types of emotional affects. Why? Despite ambiguities resulting from temporal-lobe/amygdala stimulation in humans (inconsistent results that I have previously empha- sized), stimulation of deeper subcortical circuits do yield di- verse affects consistent with animal behavioral observations (see Heath, 1996, or his archival research). A most recent ex- emplar is evoked sadness/depression (Blomstedt et al., 2007). Barrett did not appreciate my rationale for using capitaliza- tions for emotional primes - namely to minimize part-whole confusions and to highlight that the emotional networks I have characterized are only parts of the larger emotional "wholes" (in which she seems interested) that cannot be mechanistically studied yet, even though they can be conceptualized. Concep- tual acts may parse raw primary-process affects into secondary and tertiary variants, but that is theory not fact. No neurosci- entific evidence exists to suggest that undifferentiated positive and negative affects - potentially superordinate conceptual acts (Davis, Panksepp, &amp; Normansell, 2003) - are evolutionary grist for the varieties of affective feelings. Barrett didn't outline ne- uro-causal tests for her ideas, and her extensive discussion of well-known human neocortical complexities does not negate subcortical affective homologies. The abundant evidence for neuropeptidergic specificity in the control of integrated emotional and other affective processes should not be ignored. Do animals distinguish distress from hunger and thirst conceptually? Where is the evidence that feelings of nausea/disgust, fear/anxiety, separation-distress/ grief, and fatigue are conceptual progeny of core negative affect? Ditto for the many positive affects from gustatory delights to the joys of social interaction. Has Barrett suggested a research program to parse those issues neurobiologically? We need more than conceptual acts and functional magnetic resonance imag- ing correlates when it comes to mechanistic brain research. I offer testable strategies for decoding how various emotional affects are engendered in mammalian brains (Panksepp, 1971, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2007a, 2007b, 2008), with testable/negata- ble implications for development of new affect-specific psy- chiatric medications. When investigators demonstrate that brain stimulation induced arousals of emotional actions are psycho- logically neutral - that no mammal cares about such brain states - my position is falsified. If the neuropeptides that regu- late animal emotions do not influence human feelings, my po- sition is further damaged. How might we falsify conceptual-act theory neurolopsychologically? Barrett's response to my com- mentary highlighted neither relevant brain evidence nor ne- uroscientific paradigms to bolster either her conceptualism or the existence of core positive and negative affects.

(2007) distorted my empirical contributions and theoretical positions in their extended appendix, while also sharing useful references that need to be considered by those interested in the details of basic emotional networks. They also ignored the most critical neurochemical lines of evidence I had summarized (e.g., neurochemical basis of addictions). Because of space constraints, I highlight a single correction for each emotional system. I would also reemphasize that many general- purpose brain neuromodulators like norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine, as well as rapidly acting trans- mitters such as glutamate and GABA, contribute to most emo- tional states. Greater emotional and affective specificity is achieved largely through integrative neuropeptides (Panksepp, 1998) that regulate large-scale brain dynamics that may shape attractor landscapes for emotion-cognition integrations (Lewis, 2005; Panksepp, 2000). PLAY PLAY is indeed the least well-deciphered emotional system, for obvious historical/methodological reasons. Contrary to Barrett's claim, I have never made the ventral periaqueductal grey matter a definitive part of the PLAY network, and cFos protein trans- lation, though perhaps not gene transcription, is elevated in the dorsomedial thalamic parafascicular complex of rats following play (Panksepp, 1998, Figure 15.7). Further, we recently map- ped the closely associated social-joy "laughter" response: It is intimately related to ascending mesolimbic/mesocortical do- pamine systems. Every brain site evoking 50-kHz chirps sus- tained self-stimulation (Burgdorf, Wood, Kroes, Moskal, &amp; Panksepp, 2007). Volume 3- Number 4 307</page><page sequence="4">Additional Corrections for Barrett et al. (2007) RAGE Barrett claims that "it is not clear whether the circuitry for attack behaviors is the same in cats and rats (let alone humans)" (p. 311). In fact, the brainstem regions from which affective attack/defensive behaviors can be generated are essentially identical in all mammals that have been studied (see Panksepp, 1971; Siegel, 2005), suggesting deep neural homolgies. Those who have stimulated and lesioned these deep subcortical sites in humans obtained changes in anger feelings (e.g., Sano, Maya- nagi, Sekino, Ogashiwa, &amp; Ishijima, 1970; Van Hilten &amp; Nuttin, 2007). PANIC Our work was never based on the infant rat model, for reasons detailed elsewhere (Panksepp, Newman, &amp; Insel, 1992). Infant rats do not exhibit robust social bonds, and their separation- distress circuitry is vestigial compared with that seen in dogs and the other species we employed to map circuit homologies (guinea pigs, chicks). Practically all known neurochemistries that regulate separation-induced distress were first identified in species other than rats (Panksepp, 2003). As I noted in my commentary, opioids have been confirmed to regulate human sadness (Zubieta et al., 2003). SEEKING As noted above, the SEEKING system has never been linked only to dopaminergic circuitry. The massive plasticity in the behavioral manifestations of this system (Valenstein, Cox, &amp; Kakolewski, 1970) and the diverse functions of this system were fully discussed when I postulated a general-purpose appetitive SEEKING system and has been examined repeatedly since then (most recently in Alcaro et al., 2007, and in Panksepp &amp; Moskal, 2008). FEAR I never restricted my analysis of the FEAR system to freezing. Stimulation of this system yields dramatic flight behaviors and conditioned place avoidances in animals and precipitous fearful affects in humans. I know of no negations of this principle in any species, and Barrett cites none. I have often noted that the amygdala is not an optimal location to get such effects. It has long been known to be responsive to many emotive stimuli (Eleftheriou, 1972) and to be more involved with the classical conditioning of fear than with provocation of uncon- ditional fear. CARE and LUST Barrett is justifiably impressed by Michael Numan's superlative work on the neurology of maternal behavior in rats. However, Professor Numan subscribes to a radical reductionism in which only neural firing counts in the control of maternal behavior and affective experiences do not (personal communications, Fall 2005). I disagree, but Barrett apparently must agree, unless she is willing to grant nurturant affects (through conceptual acts?) to rats. It is a fact that most brain stimulation sites that promote maternal retrieval sustain self-stimulation reward. Barrett makes debatable claims that her approach covers more of the available evidence - presumably human psycho- logical evidence rather than cross-species neurobehavioral ev- idence. Nonetheless, the weight of neurological evidence indicates that raw affect, as monitored by many objective be- havioral tasks, is an aspect of aroused instinctual-emotional networks. This experimental strategy can help us decipher how raw emotional feelings are constituted by neural activities (Panksepp, 2008). Conceptual-act theory offers no comparable neuroscientific strategy. More work is surely needed to evaluate how well animals can discriminate affective states, and I out- lined some workable strategies in my commentary. As our the- oretically guided empirical work does not overlap, why do Barrett and colleagues object to basic emotional-affective net- works in subcortical regions of the mammalian brain and then highlight the importance of these brain regions for distinct emotions in their appendix, while concurrently failing to ac- knowledge abundant data indicating these systems do much more than merely control behavior? My views, arising from basic cross-species functional neu- roscience, correspond reasonably well to ideas generated by investigators of human emotions across cultures and through developmental periods (Izard, 2007). The basic emotional cir- cuits I have outlined are diverse affective parts that surely participate in various kinds of emotion-cognition interactions including conceptual acts. Our seemingly disparate viewpoints can work together to eventually yield scientifically defensible visions of emotion-cognition "wholes." Their resistance against a fruitful synthesis seems to have other reasons than the quality of affective neuroscience data. 308 Volume 3- Number 4</page></plain_text>
