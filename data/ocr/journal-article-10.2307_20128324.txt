<plain_text><page sequence="1">Emmet, D. The Effectiveness of Causes. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985. ix + 136 pp. Cloth, $34.50; paper, $14.95.?In this brief but formidable monograph Dorothy Emmet presents a splendid account of causation woven around numerous contemporary discus sions. The largest portion of this book (chs. 1-7) is devoted to an analysis of the epistemological problems of describing events in terms of cause and effect. Here Emmet defines her position in relation to the views of Davidson, Mellor, Anscombe, O'Neill, Prichard, Hornsby and others. Her main task however is to "pass beyond the episte mology to a metaphysics underpinning it" (p. 86), and this she achieves with admirable clarity in the remainder of the book (chs. 8-11). As far as the latter is concerned, Emmet's views are strongly influenced by her former teacher, A. N. Whitehead, but unlike the followers of his process thought dominant in America today, she is more sympa thetic to his views of nature developed in his middle period rather than those largely developed in Process and Reality. Furthermore, Emmet is more concerned to develop a substantial metaphysical po sition of her own rather than simply to expound Whitehead's doctrines. The crucial point upon which Emmet builds her view focuses on a critique of transeunt causation (the action of one thing on another)</page><page sequence="2">352 JANICE FLOERSCH AND STAFF and the description of events in terms of different properties at dif ferent times. This analysis of a distinguishable sequence of events invariably leads to the notion of a "Zeno universe" (ch. 2). Like the paradox of the moving arrow where "motion is defined as the occu pation by one entity of a continuous series of places at a continuous series of times" (p. 10), movement and transitions are lost. Causation, as defined on this epistemological model, can never explain the genuine effectiveness of causes. At best we are left with a more or less Humean analysis of causation, as a relation between separate events. So as Emmet contends, the emphasis on properties of events only gives us a world of events, each of which is presented as an unchanging unit. But causation is not just the possibility of predicting changes in properties. Something more than this is needed in order that cau sation stand for a propensity in things to produce effects. For a cause to have an effect, and not just a defacto successor, some stronger view of the cause actively producing the effect is needed, and this, she thinks, is to be found in the notion of immanent causation. In Chapter 8, "Immanent and Transeunt Causation," we find that the notion of persistence gives us a clue as to the goings-on in the passage of nature. According to Emmet, persistence, as a strong causal notion, is an ongoing activity where "something which is pass ing is also carrying itself forward into its next stage. This does not mean only that later stages are likely to display the same properties as earlier ones, nor is it cause and effect in temporal succession. It means that persistence is possible because of an internal activity di rected towards the future, and the product is inseparable from the activity" (p. 84). This is the key to immanent causation, and for those familiar with Whitehead, the idea is very close to his notion of causal efficacy. The active transition from one phase to another is the result of an integrating activity in nature where the brute force of the past merges into the present and beyond. Emmet also finds immanent causation in various mental processes such as memory (ch. 9), and in whole-part relations in organisms and their processes (ch. 10), and ultimately in the divine power of efficacious grace (ch. 11). The very notion of immanent causation does not in itself eliminate transeunt causation. Indeed changes in various systems of nature where the operations are understood as the action of one thing on another are necessary, but in the final analysis, this transeunt cau sation presupposes the stronger metaphysical view of immanent cau sation since these operations happen within the passage of nature. Emmet might, I think, with advantage have specified more clearly the type of ontology she prefers to suit her view of causation. Al though she is comfortable discussing causation in terms of overlapping macro-events, she is quite opposed to an exclusive event ontology. Firstly, she argues that events are edited descriptions of features of what is actually going on (p. 37). Their descriptions record something happening to participants in those occurrences. Lightning, for ex ample, is a record of the "adventure" of electrically charged particles. Events, therefore, cannot stand as the basic particulars. Secondly, as I suspect, Emmet is careful not to align her view with the panpsychic</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 353 tendencies of Whitehead's event ontology. Efficacy must disassociate its meaning from the relic of anthropomorphism. But, in the end, her participants, "some being persons and some physical things" (p. 41), are not sufficiently explained, at least where this concerns the agency needed to explain the activity of causes. This book perhaps shows a revival of interest in a type of meta physics which has been under serious attack for the better part of this century. Emmet gains a wide audience from both her mastery of the analytic approach and her refreshingly original work in meta physics.?Leemon B. McHenry, Old Dominion University.</page></plain_text>
