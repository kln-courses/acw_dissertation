<plain_text><page sequence="1">PIERRE BENOIT PAULINE AND JOHANNINE THEOLOGY: A CONTRAST I extual, literary and historical criticism of the Bible is proceeding with great vigor but the question remains: does not such research run the risk, at times, of compromising lasting encounter with the Word and an overall view of the Scriptures? I do not pretend to have an easy solution to the problem because I do not believe that such a solution exists. The immense body of literature in this field must indeed be consulted, even though it may end up absorbing almost all our time and attention, but for this very reason a less technical approach to a large subject may occasionally be all the more useful. Here I wish only to offer some reflections on important general themes in Paul and John. Professor W. C. van Unnik has called our attention to the presence of the Holy Spirit in Jesus and to the important role the Holy Spirit played in leading the faith of the first Christians to proclaim Jesus as the Christ, despite the great number of misconceptions associated at that time with such a title. This viewpoint seems quite correct. I would like to take up this idea again and investigate it further to determine how this same experience of the Holy Spirit in Jesus helped to manifest His pre-existence. In so doing, we will perhaps touch upon one of the elements which will best permit us to explain the points of agreement and difference in the Pauline and Johannine theologies. It is clear that the faith of the first Christians was not immediately conscious of the eternal divinity of Jesus Christ. Their faith only gradually discovered this mystery. In the early days after Easter and Pentecost, they understood that Jesus had been elevated to divine rank and was seated at the right hand of the Father (Acts: 2:34-36. Then re flecting on the events in His earthly life, His power and miracles, His manifestation of glory and His claim to be the Son (Mt. 21:37; 24:36) and to alone know the secrets of the Father (Mt. 11:27), they realized that even while on earth Jesus possessed the dignity with which He Father Pierre Benoit O.P. is the well-known biblical scholar long connected with the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem. The present article is based on his 1962 presidential address to the Studiorum Novi Testimenti Societas at Munster. It first appeared in French in New Testament Studies, IX, 1962-1963, pp. 193-207.</page><page sequence="2">was afterward clothed but in a manner inchoative and hidden, con forming to His chosen way of humiliation and suffering. Only then did there appear, late but on good authority, the revelation of His virginal conception. This development in the primitive Christian faith easily reveals itself in the successive stages of the New Testament. Some see here the creation of a myth; I prefer to call it the discovery of a mystery. The next question inevitably was: Who was this Jesus before His birth and marvelous career on earth? Who was this person who had come to save the world? Who was He whose coming had been preceded by the long preparations recounted in the Scriptures? Such a person could not come from nothing on the day of His conception. Surely He must have pre-existed in God before taking on human form. But how was such a mystery to be expressed? It is here, it seems, that the presence of the Spirit in Christ, both during His earthly and His glorified life, must have played a decisive role. We are indeed aware that the Scriptures often link together the Spirit and the Word as two correlative manifestations of the action of God in the world. We recall how Jesus had spoken of the role of the Father (Mt. 11:27; cf. Jn. 3:34; 12:49), how the Father had spoken on His behalf (Mk. 9:7), and how, in the role of the sower, the Father distributed the Word (Mk. 4:3 ff.). Moreover, was not Christ Himself that Word which pre-existed in God as the Spirit did? Was not He the Word which had already been occasionally manifested in the ancient economy and whose full manifestation was reserved until the messianic period? God's Word and Spirit, His eternal attributes, appear in the Scriptures as privileged expressions of His temporal manifestation. It is to us that He speaks and upon us that He breathes. Speculative theology has been able to probe legitimately into the depths of the mystery of the Word and Spirit in God, yet Holy Scripture has spoken of them, for the most part, only in their relationship to us. This is one of the two great ways that God has taken in order to come among us. The Old Testament reflects two converging currents preparing the arrival of God among men. One of these currents is that of human intermediaries who gradu ally develop from the level of the earthly and individual to that of the divine and the collective: the King-Messiah, the Servant, and the Son of Man. These are personalities which under God's direc tion, more and more resemble Him who will be their fulfillment in becoming the Christ, the suffering Saviour, the Son par excellence. The other current is that of divine intermediaries who proceed by lower ing themselves to the level of the human. In this category we have the Word and the Spirit. The Word is sent upon earth by God; it rushes towards the earth with the utmost speed (Ps. 147:15; cf. 107:20). All powerful, it eagerly sets forth from the royal throne to accomplish the 340 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 196S</page><page sequence="3">work of God (Wis. 18:14-16; cf. Is. 55:10-11). The Spirit, taken away from sinful man (Gn. 6:3), will again be given by God in the messianic times as promised by His prophets (Is. 32:15; Ez 36:26-27; Jl. 3:1). The Messiah will be the first to receive the Spirit (Is. 11:2). The fusion of these two currents—currents indeed recognized by the early Christians in the ancient Scriptures—enabled their faith to grasp and express the mystery of Jesus. The first thing they perceived was the human element in Him. He was the Messiah, the Servant, the Son of Man. The discovery in Him, however, of the Spirit-giving Word had to await the progressive development of their faith. This discovery was to reveal, thanks to the historical person of Jesus, the truly personal character—one would later use the term hypostatic—of these divine attributes which until that time had scarcely passed beyond the realm of poetic personification. This grasp of the mystery of Jesus in its eternal depths was certainly not the privilege of Paul and John alone. If there is one fact that recent research has made more and more clear, it is that these two most eminent theologians are not the first theologians of Christianity. From its humble beginnings in the kerygma, catechesis and gospel accounts, Christian tradition has had no greater task than to establish the person and the mission of Jesus as the central elements in the divine plan. We are already dealing with theology here at this early date even though it is unsystematized. Paul and John are neither alone nor first in this attempt to acquire theological understanding. Paul received the faith only after many others and he received more from the early Christian community than he would lead us to believe (Gal. 1:11, 16: 2:6; 1 Cor. 11:23 ff.; 15:3 ff.). The apostle John can be considered the source of the Johannine tradition but his testimony was not expressed in the form of the fourth gospel until after a long period of development. Granted these considerations, it is still true to say that the Pauline and Johannine writings are the privileged loci where the notion of the pre-existence of Christ is expressed. We are justified, therefore, in giving them our attention and in trying to determine by a process of comparison the different directions taken by them in their common endeavor. Having come to my central thesis, I will briefly state its essential insight to clarify our direction of thought. Then I will develop this insight in detail. The combined action of the Word and the Spirit of God appears to us in the Old Testament under two correlative but distinct aspects: creation and revelation. After having illustrated this idea textually, I will present for your consideration the thesis that Paul has retained more the aspect of creation, while John stresses reve lation. These two different points of departure, this twofold illumina tion, disparate yet converging, seems to furnish a satisfying explanation of the agreements and differences of the two systems. PIERRE BENOIT 341</page><page sequence="4">In the beginning of the Book of Genesis we note that the Word and the Spirit appear in God to describe His creative activity. "In the beginning God created heaven and earth ... The Spirit of God hovered over the waters. God said: let there be light and there was light" (Gn. 1:1-3). In the next chapter, God forms man from the clay of the earth and breathes into his nostrils the breath of life (Gn. 2:7). This latter passage is but a more figurative presentation of the same basic idea— by His Word or His hands God determines the nature of the being He intends to create; by His breath which is His "Spirit" He gives this being the power to exist and act. Such a mode of expression is, without a doubt, anthropomorphic, yet justified because it is an anthropo morphism which leads to God. Man perceives in his own word and his own breath the manifestations of his thought and energy, but he possesses all these only in virtue of the action of His creator. Thus when he speaks in this manner about the God who created him, he only renders to Him what he has received from Him. This union of the Word and the Spirit in their creative activity appears more than once in the Bible. To mention only a few places: Ps. 33:6: "By the Word of God the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host," or Ps. 147:18: "He sends forth His Word and melts them; He makes His Spirit blow and the waters flow." In Jud. 16:14 we find: "Let all your creation serve you, for you but spoke and they were created; you sent forth your Spirit, and it formed them." Passages do occur where the Word is mentioned alone with regard to creation (Sir. 42:15; Is. 40:26; 48:13); however this is also true of the Spirit (Ps. 104:29-30). Such texts merely serve to com plement one another. Word and Spirit are the dual realities in all the governing activity of God (Is. 34:16) and of the King-Messiah (Is. 11:4). Ez. 37:4-10 is of special interest because there Word and Spirit preside over that re-creation realized in the resurrection of the dry bones: "Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, Ο dry bones, hear the Word of the Lord! Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold I am causing the Spirit to enter you, and you shall live..." The second aspect of God's activity through His Word and His Spirit is, as mentioned earlier, that of revelation. Less effort is required to find texts illustrating this aspect. Everyone recalls the numerous examples of the Spirit of God taking possession of a prophet in order to communicate to him the Word of revelation which the prophet will have to convey to the people. David declares at the opening of his "last words": "By me the Spirit of Jahweh has spoken, His Word is upon my tongue" (2 S. 23:2). The prophet, pre-figuring Christ, an nounces in similar language his mission of salvation: "The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is upon me, for Yahweh has anointed me. He has sent me to bring the good news to the lowly" (Is. 61:1; cf. Lk. 4:18-19). Again, God promises him, "My Spirit which is upon you and my 342 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1945</page><page sequence="5">Words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your offspring from henceforward, even forever" (Is. 59:21). Za. 7:12 speaks of the Words which the Lord of Hosts has sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets. From the time of Moses (Nm. 11:17, 25) to the eschatological era (Jl. 3:1-2), every inspired prophet knows and speaks God's message only through His Spirit (1 K. 22:22-28; Ez. 13:3; Dt. 4:15). If Balaam is able to proclaim himself an oracle who hears the words of God, it is because "the Spirit of God has come upon him" (Nm. 24:2-4). In God, indeed, creation and revelation are not in opposition; rather they complement one another. We can say, without being para doxical, that He creates by way of revelation and that every revelation terminates in a creation. What does it mean to say that God creates unless it be to say that He reveals His sovereign Thought through a Word so efficacious that objects come into being from nothingness? When He reveals His Will, is it not with such power that it is executed immediately? He it is "who gives life to the dead and calls nothingness into existence." Abraham believed God's Word and became the "father of us all" in fulfillment of the scriptural saying: "I have made you the father of many nations" (Rom. 4:17-18). The close connection between creation and revelation is clearly seen in the divine attribute of Wisdom which assumed importance in the later stages of biblical revelation. Wisdom, to some degree, takes the place of the Word and, like it, is related to the Spirit (Sir. 24:3; Wis. 9:17). Wisdom plays the role now of a creator (Prv. 8:22-30; 3:19; Wis. 7:21; 8:1), now of a revealer (Prv. 8:1-21; Sir. 24:23-24; Wis. 7:15-21). A eulogy of Wisdom such as that found in Wis. 7:22-9:18 closely unites the double aspects of creation and revelation. Wisdom also desires to take up its dwelling among men (Prv. 8:31; Sir. 24:6 ff.), a desire which Tesus was conscious of having fulfilled in Himself (Mt. 11:25-27; cf. 11:19; 12:42). If creation and revelation, however, are identical acts in God who is infinitely simple in His being, we are not prohibited from distinguish ing them. On the contrary, such a distinction is most convenient be cause creation and revelation produce different effects in the creature and it is important that each of these effects be received in its proper manner. It is one thing for us to receive existence and life, another to receive light and knowledge. There are different stages in one's encounter with God and consequently in one's theological and mystical consciousness. Following this distinction, cannot the characteristic features of John and Paul be distinguished? It seems to me that John prefers to move in the domain of revelation. For him, Jesus is above all else the Word (Jn. 1:1; 1 Jn. 1:1), who has come from God (1:9-14) in order to make known the Father (1:18). He does not speak of Himself but of what He has seen and under PIERRE BENOIT 343</page><page sequence="6">stood of the Father (3:11; 7:16-18; 8:28,38; 12:49-50; 14:24). His word takes the form of testimonial (3:11, 32; 8:14, 18; 18:37) which is under scored by the testimony of the Father (5:32, 37; 8:18), the Scriptures (5:39), and John the Baptist (1:7, 15, 19 fE.; 3:26-30; 5:33). The works which give testimony to Jesus (5:36; 10:25, 37 ff·) are themselves con sidered as "signs," that is to say, as prodigies which enlighten the spirit and invite it to believe (2:11, 23; 4;48—54; 6:30; 12:37). The Spirit is closely associated with the Word in this work of revelation. "He whom God has sent speaks God's words, for God gives him His spirit without measure (3:34). His role as the Paraclete after the departure of Jesus will be to give testimony of Him (15:26) and to recall and teach all that He had said (14:26), and even to add what the apostles have not yet been able to understand to lead them to the fullness of truth (16:13). The theme of Truth and the associated themes of Light and Glory thoroughly permeate the atmosphere of the fourth gospel. Jesus is the true Light who enlightens all men (1:9), the light of the world (9:5), the light of life (8:12) who comes to dispel the shadows (8:12; 12:35 ff.). Each man must make his choice to accept the light or to remain in the darkness (3:19-21; 9:39; 12:46), and in this choice the judgment of God is to be found. Jesus speaks the Truth (8:45 ff.); He is the truth (14:6), and the Spirit which He promises is the "Spirit of truth" (15:26; 16:13). Through sin men have become slaves to the Father of lies, the Devil; by receiving the word of Christ and by becoming His disciples they will come to know the truth and will become free (8:31 47). Salvation is therefore primarily a matter of knowledge, illumination, and faith. The theme of Glory is rather akin to the themes of light and Truth. This Doxa, which translates the Kabôd of the Old Testa ment, is the splendor of the divine majesty and the radiance of His brilliance. The entire life of Jesus as presented in the fourth gospel can be seen as a manifestation of that divine glory: the glory of the Father which Jesus achieves by manifesting His name to men (17:4-6), the glory of the Son which He has received from His Father from all eternity (1:14); 17:5, 24). Consequently, whether He manifests that glory progressively through His signs and miracles (2:11; 9:40), or whether He regains it in its fullness through His exaltation on the Cross, it is always the Father whom He glorifies and who in turn glorifies Him (17:1-5; cf. 8:54; 12:23, 28; 13:31-2). These major themes, which can also be easily illustrated in parallel passages from the first epistle of John, are not the sole themes in Joliannine theology but they are its most characteristic ones. The fourth gospel along with the rest of the New Testament contains a whole series of ideas and doctrines which have their roots in primitive Christianity. This gospel's distinguishing feature, however, is to be found in the manner in which it presents and develops them. The 344 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1965</page><page sequence="7">idea of a divine revelation realized in Jesus seems to be the major and most predominant insight of the fourth gospel. It is the core around which the whole gospel is structured. In passing from John to Paul, the reader quickly experiences a different structure of thought. In Paul also we find a whole doctrinal substratum which has its origin in the faith of the primitive community, yet which is dominated by a thought structure peculiar to him and is best characterized by the idea of Re-creation. When he speaks of the work of the dead and risen Christ, Paul does not ignore the aspects of expiation, sacrifice, justification, redemption, and reconciliation; he stresses, however, the concept of the New Creation and it is here, without a doubt, that we find his most personal contribution. Together with Paul, the reader feels himself on the dividing line between two worlds. Through His Son God comes to remake the world. "If anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being; the old state of things has passed away; there is a new state of things" (2 Cor. 5:17; cf. Gal. 6:15). God created the world through His Word and His Spirit and He comes in the person of Christ to re-create it in the same way. To put the matter more precisely, through the crucified Christ He has destroyed the old world which through sin had become a slave to Law, Death, and the Principalities of evil. In a word, God destroyed the Old Man who had become "sinful flesh." After this work of death, He has re-impressed upon man the seal of His Image—Paul uses this term rather than the term Word—and He has re-infused His Spirit in him. All this was accomplished by the Resurrection. Jesus is indeed the Image of God (2 Cor. 4:4). He is, as it were, the First-Born Son, and it is He whom His innumerable brothers should strive to imitate (Romans 8:29). In the beginning God created all things in Him and when He raised Him up from the dead, He re-created all things in Him (Col. 1:15-20). He is the New Man, created according to God's wishes, in uprightness and the holiness of truth (Eph. 4:21), with which every man is to clothe himself through faith and baptism (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 13:14; Eph. 4:22-24). Then, as if in a new terrestrial Paradise, man will make his way towards true knowledge and renew himself in the Image of his Creator (Col. 3:10). This New Man, upright and holy, which man is to put on is primarily the risen Christ Himself such as He comes forth from the tomb as the head of a new race, a new humanity. "There is no longer question of Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or freeborn; Christ is every thing and in us all" (Col. 3:11; cf. Gal. 3:27-28). The Holy Spirit is the agent of this resurrection and the person who enables man to imitate the Son. He acts together with the Word in this new creation in a manner similar to that of the first creation. It is through the power of the Spirit that God brought Jesus back to life (Rom. 1:4 ff.), and through PIERRE BENOIT 345</page><page sequence="8">this same power He will again raise to life those who believe in Him. (Rom. 8:11 ff.). As mentioned earlier, creation and revelation are two correlative manifestations of one and the same profound reality. Paul and John could not possibly stress the one and ignore the other. In his treat ment of Christ as the Image of God, Paul does not ignore the fact that His countenance radiates the glory attested in the Gospel (2 Cor. 4:4 6). Nor does he ignore the theme of Christ as the Wisdom of God, hidden for ages and now revealed on the Cross, whom the Spirit of God alone enables us to know (1 Cor. 1:17-2:16). Paul presents the Word as an evangelical message offering itself with the power of the Holy Spirit and bearing fruit for those who accept it in faith (1 Th. 1:5-6, 2:13; Col. 1:5-6; Eph. 1:13). He beseeches God to grant His faith ful followers "a spirit of wisdom and revelation" which will enable them to know and contemplate His mystery of salvation (Eph. 1:17 ff.)· There are many other themes in Paul that present the Word and the Spirit under the aspect of revelation. John, on the other hand, does not restrict himself merely to the level of intellectual illumination. Truth in John's gospel does not have the abstract and speculative characteristics so commonly found in Greek thought. In accord with its biblical origin, Truth rather denotes the total commitment of being. Man is not simply to listen to the truth; he is to keep it (Jn. 12:47; 14:23) and abide in it (8:31). The words of Jesus are spirit and life (6:63). To hear and keep these words is to pass from death to life (5:24; 8:51). "I am the resurrection; he who believes in me, though he be dead, will have life" (11:25). John even speaks of baptism as a new birth: "Unless a man be born again of the water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. What is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the Spirit is spirit" (3:5-6). Yet a "new birth" is not a "new creation." Even the initial creation of all things in the Word is presented rather as the gift of a Life which is Light (1:3-4, 9). It remains true, therefore, to say that in the final analysis salvation for John consists more in a re-birth to the life of a truly illuminated knowledge of God, while for Paul salvation essentially consists in the transition from death to life by means of a re-creation of the whole being. If this general view of both systems of thought is sound, it should be possible to verify these insights in their individual parts. As I already said, Paul and John employ a great number of basic themes which they share with all primitive Christianity. Their distinctive points of view, however, cannot help but differently color these common themes. I would like now to attempt such an analysis and to examine certain important themes in the light of the theories just developed. One of the first themes that comes to our attention is that of Sin. For Paul, Hamartia denotes an evil force, a personified power which 346 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1965</page><page sequence="9">characterized the old world and which by abiding in his flesh and giving him over to death, dominates and enslaves man. The sole means of destroying sin is to destroy this "sinful flesh" which has been made its docile instrument. This is to be achieved by a death which kills the sinner yet frees and prepares man to receive the Spirit. This is what has been achieved in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and repeated again in all those who incorporate themselves in Him. Sin entered the world by the transgression of the First Adam and has been driven out by the obedience of the New Adam. In this New Adam, God has remade His work and created a New Man who no longer lives according to the flesh but according to the Spirit (Rom. 5-8). John's conception of sin is quite different. One is reluctant to say that he equates it with error, in the Socratic sense, yet his predominant preoccupation with knowledge leads him somewhat in this direction. In John's thought, sin is a refusal of the Truth, a refusal of the Light, a refusal to believe."If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin" (Jn. 15:22; cf. 24). "The paraclete will convict the world of sin ... because they do not believe in me" 16:7-9). Sin is blind and, what is worse, is not aware of its blindness (9:41); it is a lie and makes one a slave (8:34) of the devil, the father of lies (8:44). Jesus speaks the truth and consequently cannot be convicted of sin (8:46). Sin, then, clearly consists in not believing Him whom God has sent, in not listen ing to His words, and in preferring darkness to the light (8:42-43, 45, 47; 3:18-21). For John sin is an offense against the light, whereas for Paul it is a disorder introduced in the first creation which the second creation seeks to correct. If we consider the theme of the Law we will observe similar vari ations. In John the notion of Law appears relatively rarely and remains basically faithful to the Old Testament concept of an expression of the divine will appealing to the spirit of man and soliciting his obedience. The Law is to be observed (John 7:19) and its command ments executed (7:22-23). But the Law contains a cognitive and doctrinal aspect as well. This fact is clearly manifested in the particular role that the fourth gospel assigns to it—the role of rendering testimony to Jesus (5:39), for it is about Him that Moses has written (5:46; cf. 1:45). In announcing the coming of Christ, the Law entrusted to Moses appears as an early intimation of the grace and truth that God's only Son was to bring in His plenitude (1:14-17). This testimonial nature of the Law is certainly recognized in Paul's writings, but there it is understood in the more restricted sense of moral knowledge revealing the commands which lead to uprightness (Rom. 7:12). Moreover, he mercilessly denounces the Law because of its negative and restrictive nature. While supposedly enlightening the PIERRE BENOIT 347</page><page sequence="10">conscience, it incites it to covetousness (Rom. 7:7-8); it transforms a material fault into a formal "transgression" (Rom. 4:15; 5:13). Finally, it condemns the sinner to undergo wrath (Rom. 4:15), a curse (Gal 3:10), and death (Rom. 7:9-11; 8:2). The Law is likened, then, to Sin and is considered as its docile partner. Because of his insistence on this close association of Sin and the Law, Paul makes the Law a cosmic force as he had done with Sin. The Law appears, therefore, as a step in the divine plan, and, like a teacher, prepares the new economy (Gal. 3:24). Yet, of itself, the Law belongs to the old economy and is predestined to disappear with it. The fundamental dialectic of Pauline thought alternates between the old world which has been destroyed and the new world that has been re-created; the Law is appraised in terms of this dialectic. In submitting Himself to the Law (Gal. 4:4), Christ died at the hands of the Law for He underwent its decree of death (Gal. 3:13; Rom. 8:3; Col. 2:14). But by the same act, He died to the Law (Gal. 2:19; Rom. 7:4-6), or, if you prefer, the Law itself was rendered lifeless. It resembled an insect that has lost its sting (1 Cor. 15:56 on death), and died in trying to kill its victim. Though it was the strength of the old creation, the Law disappears in the new creation in order to make place for the "law of faith" (Rom. 3:27), the "law of Christ" (Gal. 6:2), the "law of the Spirit" (Rom. 8:2) where uprightness flourishes in love (Gal. 5:14; Rom. 13:8 ff.) through obedience to the Spirit (Rom. 8:2). The closely allied theme of Justification is too well known in Paul to require long exposition. Let us note only the ontological realism which it receives from his concept of re-creation. The righteousness that Christ has obtained for us by the Cross (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3-4) is as real in Him and in us as sanctification and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30; 6:11). All this takes place in the economy of the new world achieved by the resurrection of Christ. The believer already participates in this new creation by reason of his complete spiritual being. To consider justification only in terms of a divine decision made known to the human intelligence and thereby to neglect the present change in the human condition that justification implies, would be to mis conceive the Pauline problematic of an actual re-creation realized totally in Christ and inchoatively in the Christian. Justification for Paul is not a matter of knowledge; it is an intrinsic renewal of a person's being. Perhaps the theme of justification might appear to be badly chosen as a basis for such a comparison between Paul and John as we profess to make. Nevertheless, it is not as absent in John's thought as might appear at first sight. The theme is encountered in the closely related idea of the Judgment which has been entrusted to the Son by the Father and which takes place in the very manifestation of the Light (Jn. 3:18-21). Whoever listens to the word of Him who has been sent 348 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1965</page><page sequence="11">by the Father possesses eternal life and will not come to judgment (5:22-24). Whoever does not listen will meet his judge who will con demn him: "the very message which I have given will be his judge on the Last Day" (12:47-48). The judgment which justifies or condemns a man is again elevated by John to the realm of revelation so dear to him. "I have come into this world to judge men, that those who cannot see may see and that those who can see may become blind" (9:39). Elsewhere the Christ of the Johannine gospel says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now will the prince of the world be cast out" (12:31). This statement leads us to another aspect of the theme of justification in John which has been stressed by the late lamented Theo Preiss, namely, the great struggle between Jesus and the Prince of this world. The latter would suppress his antagonist and condemn Him to the cross (6:70; 8:44; 13:2,27); however he can do nothing against him (14:30). He himself will be condemned by that very cross because once Jesus has been elevated from the earth He will draw all things to Himself (12:32). Thus the world will be left confounded and for two reasons. The first is concerned with the "question of justice:" Jesus will return to the Father thereby proving His divine origin. The second is related to the "question of judgment:" the Prince of this world will appear as condemned (16:ΙΟ Ι 1). The Johannine conception of the justice of the divine judgment thus clearly presents itself as a manifestation of defeat and victory: the defeat of the Father of lies and of those whom he deludes, and the victory of the truth-bringing messenger of the Father and of those who believe in Him. Here as elsewhere John is dealing with the question of knowledge; knowledge which is of course, religious and spiritual. We have just been treating of the Devil and this presents us with a new area of reflection, namely, the role of the Principalities of evil in both systems. The context in which these forces are treated is not the same in both authors. John remains faithful to the biblical concept of Satan as a rebellious angel and seducer, though adding the Qumrâm notion of Satan as the Prince of this world and chief of the realm of darkness. While Paul does not ignore this trend of thought (1 Th. 2:18; 3:5; 2 Th. 2:9; 1 Cor. 5:5; 2 Cor. 2:11; 4:4; 11:14; Eph. 2:2), he combines it with concepts pagan in origin yet already partly incorpo rated into Judaic thought. He prefers to treat the forces of evil under the aspect of cosmic forces which preside over the course of this world (1 Cor. 2:8; Col. 1:16; 2:15, Eph. 1:21; 3:10; 6:12) and are at the head of its "material elements" (Gal. 4:3, 9; Col. 2:8, 20). Although both treat of different realities and although this difference is increased in Paul's case by the indiscreet speculations of the teachers of the Colossians, the leading trends of thought in the two systems can still be sufficiently recognized even in the question of the Principalities of evil. As we have already mentioned, in John's thought the Devil is above all else PIERRE BENOIT 349</page><page sequence="12">the father of lies; his method of fighting against God is to darken minds and thereby deprive them of the light (Jn. 8:42-47). Paul him self is also aware of this aspect of the devil's activity (2 Th. 2:9 ff.; 2 Cor. 4:4; 11:14), but the cosmic mission which he attributes to these celestial principalities makes them forces of the old world which is to disappear with the coming of the new world re-created in Christ. Behind the Mosaic Law, whose promulgation the Judaic tradition attributed to the angels (Gal. 3:19; cf. Acts 7:38, 53; Heb. 2:2), and behind all the other religious laws which, like the Mosaic Law, concern themselves with material observances, dates of feasts and diet regulations, Paul sees the celestial Principalities which with the cooperation of man (Col. 2:18) have tyrannized the ancient world and reduced it to a state of slavery (Gal. 4:3, 9; Col. 2:8). In dying to sin and the Law, Christ has also died to these "Elements of the world" (Col. 2:20). He has deprived these Principalities of their usurped power; henceforward they can do nothing but participate in His triumph like chained prison ers (Col. 2:15). They received their influential power in the world of the first creation and lost it in the newly re-created world. Thus Paul's thought again returns to the theme of cosmic renewal. By His exaltation on the cross Jesus will triumph over the Prince of this world (Jn. 12:32) and it is worthy of note that it is in this context of a glorious manifestation that the fourth gospel employs the title of Son of Man. This title is used by the synoptic writers to express both the humiliation of the Passion as well as the triumph of the Resurrection and the Parousia. The Christ of the Johannine Gospel, however, scarcely uses this title except with respect to the glorification (12:23; 13:31), the exaltation on the cross (3:13-14; 6:62; 8:28; 12:32— 34), and other manifestations of His celestial dignity (1:51; 5:27) and spiritual gifts (6:27, 53). In using this traditional notion of the Son of Man received from the very lips of Jesus, John is always preoc cupied with the idea of manifestation which evokes an act of faith (9:35). Paul never uses the term "Son of Man" but he seems indeed to have maintained its theological content in the different passages of his works and in particular in 1 Cor. 15:45-47 where he juxtaposes the first Adam, who was a natural and earthly creature, and the second Adam who was spiritual and celestial. Many see in this notion of the second Adam the manifestation of the theme of the First Man, past and future, already foreshadowed in Daniel's Son of Man. It is striking that Paul should use this theme in a context which evokes his fundamental theme of a first and second creation. At this point in my paper I am tempted to quote the following passage from the Epistle to the Hebrews: "We have much to say on this subject and it is difficult to explain it," without, however, adding the concluding part of that verse, "because you have grown dull of hearing" (5:11). You have not grown dull of hearing; it is rather the fact that 350 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1965</page><page sequence="13">I do not have sufficient time at my disposal that is the cause of my annoyance. Consequently, I can only rapidly indicate a few additional areas where the differences characteristic of Paul and John can be observed. The area of Faith is one such example. For both theologians faith is a commitment of one's whole being, heart as well as spirit. Without such a commitment faith would be neither authentic nor Christian. Yet in John's gospel faith appears to be more contemplative in nature, while for Paul it is more creative. John closely likens it to vision. "He saw and he believed" (Jn. 20:8). The same idea is to be found in the following passage: "Blessed be those who have not seen and yet believe" (20:29). This dialectic of seeing and believing clearly illustrates how the Johannine faith utilizes the category of light (cf. 1:50; 2:23; 3:11-12; 4:48; 7:3-5; 9:37-39; 11:40; 12:44-45; 14:19-20). Faith in the writings of Paul is also an acceptance of the Word (Rom. 10:14-17), and adherence to a doctrine (Rom. 6:17; Col. 2:6-7), but it quickly takes on the characteristics of a radical incorporation in Christ (Gal. 2:20; Eph. 3:17), a gift of salvation due solely to God's grace (Eph. 2:8-9), a stage in the divine plan of salvation replacing the Law and introducing a new era, the era of man re-created in Christ (Gal. 3:23-28). Paul considers the Sacraments of faith in the same context of re creation. Baptism is associated with the death and resurrection of Christ (Rom. 6:3-11; Col. 2:12); it is the initiation into the escha tological and celestial state of the new creation (Col. 3:1—4; Eph. 2:6). The Eucharist proclaims the death and return of the Lord (1 Cor. 11:26). For John, however, these same sacraments appear rather as illuminating encounters with the Life that is Light. He introduces the Eucharist in the sixth chapter by means of a long discourse on Christ as the bread of heaven and the gift of wisdom. The flesh and blood which Christ offers as food and drink will bring that "eternal life" (6:54) which consists in knowing the one true God and Him whom He has sent, Jesus Christ (17:3). Baptism causes a person to be born into the King dom of God (3:3-5) because it places in the renewed man a "seed" (1 Jn. 3:9) which is nothing else but the Word (1 Pt. 1:23; cf. Jas. 1:18). In such a conception of baptism, which seems to be derived from the primitive baptismal catechesis but which John truly makes his own, the seed of life sown in baptism appears to be more an illuminating force than a creative power which raises one from the realm of the dead, as in Paul's thought. To be sure there is no contradiction in these different points of view. John's and Paul's views complement each other in an extremely enriching manner and it is quite important that these rich nuances of their thought be not blurred. A final manner of comparing the two systems of thought would be to compare their concepts of eschatology. Such a task would be immense PIERRE BENOIT 351</page><page sequence="14">and can be but briefly discussed here. Suffice it to say that John super imposes the dual world of sin and grace, death and life, while Paul juxtaposes them. Their concepts develop along lines that can be described respectively as vertical and horizontal. John envisions two worlds: the world above and the world below, the world of light and of darkness, of truth and of lies. Jesus descends from this first world to the second, from heaven to earth, in order to manifest the light and the truth by His Word and Spirit. He points out the way by His return to the Father achieved through exaltation of the Cross. To believe in Him and to follow Him is to be liberated from the world below, to renounce the Prince of this world and his lies and to enter into the knowledge of the only true God. Paul develops his thought more along a horizontal line, a line broken by the event of the Cross, an event which decisively marks both a rupture and a new be ginning. There is a "before" and an "after;" one must choose be tween them. The "before" is the old world of the first creation with its burdens of the flesh and sin, law and death, servitude and rebellion. The "after" is the new world of the new creation where Spirit and grace, liberty and life, and the loving service of sons reign. For both John and Paul, God has spoken in Jesus Christ and sent forth His Spirit; in John the redeemed world that results from their mission is more transcendent in nature; in Paul it is the world that follows after the event of the Cross. If the strict sense of the escha tological, that is, of the last times, is clearly less visible in John than in Paul, is this not because he is thinking less of the coming of a newly re-created world than of an illumination enabling man to attain to eternal truth? It seems to me that behind these two points of view, behind these two theological outlooks—each of which is captivating and justifiable though different from the other—there are two distinct temperaments and, in the final analysis, two different experiences. My last considera tion will treat of these differences. With regard to differences in temperament, John is a contemplative. The theologian who is the source of the Johannine tradition and who has so strongly stamped it with the mark of his genius seems taken up with the realities of knowledge, light, and truth. Like an eagle which hovers and circles about, he remains on high constantly repeating in a multitude of different ways the major themes that are so dear to him. The actual form of the fourth gospel must have taken long years of reflection and it has been transmitted to us through a whole group of successive redactors whose work still remains discernible in the book. This should not lead us to deny the fact that an extremely original mind is the underlying cause of the striking unity which prevails throughout this long work. I personally tend to see in this unity the contemplative spirit of the apostle John. 352 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1965</page><page sequence="15">Paul, on the contrary, is a fighter, a man of action, dynamic, crea tive, a founder of churches. His intellectual powers, by no means less than those of John, reveal themselves in a striking manner. He cannot remain permanently in one community, be it Antioch or Ephesus, but rushes from one town to another, from Philippi to Corinth, from Athens to Rome, everywhere establishing the Church of Christ. In these activities he is particularly preoccupied with the new creation which is the work of Christ. For Paul, as for John, it is a question of opening oneself to the light, but his predominant concern is building a new world in the place of the old one which is in the process of col lapsing. I also spoke of two experiences. Paul's is that of the vision on the road to Damascus. There he encountered the risen Christ; He whom Paul scorned as justly condemned and crucified lived on, now with a new life, a life shared by His faithful followers whom he, Paul, had dared to persecute. Swept up in his devotion to his new Master, Paul moved from his old Judaic world, fervent yet ineffective, into a new world where all things became possible because the power of the resurrection was already at work in it. How could he not devote his fiery personality to this work of the risen Christ? It is from this work that his thought and preaching were to receive all their force. John's initial experience, though less striking, is not on that account less profound; it is the experience of a young man of sixteen or eighteen who encountered Christ and became captivated by the light which radiated from Him. Permit me to recount here an observation made by my former professor, Father Lagrange. "When Jesus," he said, "was arguing with the doctors of the Temple, most of the apostles became bored for they found the discussion too subtle. The impatient Peter pulled Christ by the sleeve in an attempt to get Him to put an end to such a discussion, but the young John listened and listened intently." This story shows great insight into John and invites us to recognize in his teaching an echo, elaborated and yet no less authentic, of the words of the Lord which the more popular synoptic tradition has not retained but which deserve to be received with careful attention. In our beautiful cathedrals, so conducive to prayer, we wander now through this portal, now through that, now towards this Romanesque nave, now towards that Gothic choir. We find there so many different types of art, so many different insights and illuminations. Each in its own way prepares our hearts and helps us to put ourselves in God's presence. Likewise it is good to approach Christ at times through Paul and at times through John. Each has his distinct way of speaking to us; each complements the other. It is by listening to both of them that we will more and more encounter in faith the all-holy God who will renew and illumine us by the Word of His Christ and the power of His Spirit. translated by L.
