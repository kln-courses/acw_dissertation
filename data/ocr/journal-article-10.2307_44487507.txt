In this book Scovel discusses the on-again-off-again debate on the existence of a critical period for language acquisition. It focuses on two issues: the scope of the critical period hypothesis and the theoretical explanation underlying the hypothesis. Scovel argues for a critical period but restricts it solely to the acquisition of phonology. To support his position, he presents a critical review of his and others' research on L2 learners' ability to acquire accentless speech, from which he concludes that his thesis is indeed correct. To dispel the concerns that learners and teachers may have regarding the futility of their efforts, Scovel downplays the pedagogical significance of his hypothesis: "the critical period for accent- less speech simply means that adults will never learn to pass themselves off as native speakers phonologically- a fairly useless linguistic goal to begin with" (p. 185). Although 1 concur with Scovel on the relatively trivial role that phonological accuracy plays in second language commu- nication, it is not at all clear that the critical period, if there is one, is limited to phonology. Scovel's review of the literature on syntactic acquisition in L2 is nowhere near as thorough as his analysis of the phonology research. Citing only three studies on the acquisition of syntax in L2 and ignoring the important work carried out be researchers such as Bley-Vroman, Flynn, Gass, Schacter, White, and Zobl, among others, he concludes that "the answer to whether there exists a critical period for syntax ranges from a potential maybe to a probable no" (p. 171). The issue of our capacity to successfully acquire the syntax of a second language is far from settled, and until it is, this aspect of Scovel's claim remains speculative at best. To explain why there should even be a critical period restricted to phonology in the first place, Scovel relies on the rationalizations of sociobiology, the central assertion of which is that "all aspects of human culture and behavior, like the behavior of all animals, are coded in the genes and have been molded by natural selection" (Lewontin, Rose, &amp; Kamin, 1984, pp. 235-236). Adherents of biological determinism typically follow a tripartite argument: first, describe the human phenomenon to be explained, in this case accented speech after the onset of puberty; then, claim that the supposed feature is universal and genotypically coded; finally, link the phenomenon to natural selection (Lewontin et al., 1984, pp. 243-244). Woven into the fabric of the argument is an anthropomorphic thread in which ways of talking about human social experience are ascribed to animals and then, in a move analogous to lexical backformation, human behavior is "rederived from the animals as if it were a special case of a general phenome- non that had been independently discovered in other species" (Lewontin et al., 1984, p. 249). According to Scovel, because avian songs, such as the mating call of the white-crowned sparrow, for example, are genetically imprinted and serve to prevent interspecies breeding, human phonological capacity, supposedly originating in the vocalizations of early hominids, must in evolutionary terms have an analogous source and function. Continuing his argument, Scovel observes that the decline of our ability to acquire accentless speech is suspiciously synchronous with the emergence of our ability to contribute to the gene pool, and accordingly it becomes "imperative that by this point [the onset of puberty] the individual is capable of distinguishing mates who might enhance the chances of future genetic success from those who might inhibit those chances" (pp. 80-81). The requisite identification of unsuitable mates is insured, according to Scovel, by the loss of our ability to acquire perfectly the articulatory traits of other communities. From this, we are to conclude that humans are genetically programmed to breed within phonologically circumscribed groups! As far as I can determine, there are at least two fundamental flaws in this line of argumenta-</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 85 tion. First, not all bird songs are genetically imprinted. The song of the bullfinch, for instance, is learned from its father, no matter what that song may be (Lewontin et al., 1984, p. 256). Second, as I understand the principles of genetics, the idea in reproducing is to create heterogeneity in the gene pool. Consanguinity, as the royal houses of Europe have discovered, ultimately gives rise to recessive diseases. Wouldn't the gene responsible for reproduction, assuming there is such a gene, want us to breed with outsiders to enhance the vigor of the gene pool rather than constrain us to our own kind? Moreover, if all humans are genetically identical for a particular trait, as Scovel assumes for accentless speech, it is impossible to empirically verify the existence of the responsible gene, again assuming one exists. For genetics to detect the presence of a gene, mutations must arise in the population. In this case the mutants would be individuals who successfully acquired accentless speech after puberty. But Scovel rejects the existence of precise- ly these individuals in the general population and discredits those studies that attest to their presence. Thus, if there are no mutants, Scovel's claim on the genetic origins of accentless speech is empirically unverifiable. To be fair, he does reluctantly acknowledge the statistical possibility that .13% of the population might be free of critical period constraints, and, thus, somewhat serendipitously, allows for a minute number of the requisite mutants. The fact that accentless speech is not genetically determined does not, of course, rule out the possibility that it is difficult to learn the sound system of a second language for other reasons. Because pronunciation is a motor activity, it is entirely conceivable that it, as other motor activities such as athletic skills and learning to play musical instruments, simply tends to atrophy with age. This however does not require genetic specificity. In this reviewer's opinion, Scovel's argument in support of a genetically imprinted critical period for phonology is unconvincing.
