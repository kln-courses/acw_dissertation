<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOURTH SYMPOSIUM Has the Present Any Duration ? RicHARD M. GALE UNIVERSITY OF PIITSBURGH Commentators: LAIRD ADDIS UNIVERSITY OF IOWA JAY F. ROSENBERG UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL This question has given rise to numerous perplexities. Con- ceptual arguments of a reductio ad absurdum type have been ad- vanced in support of opposite answers to it, giving rise to the appearance of an antinomy. For example: Thesis Whatever occurs requires a finite time in which to occur. If the present were punctal, it would not contain a finite time; and, thus, nothing could occur in the present. Since something occurs only when it is present, nothing could occur, which is absurd. Antithesis To be co-present is to be simultaneous. If the present were of finite duration, it would- include -successive elements. Thus, -th-ere would 'be successive elements that are co-present and therefore simultaneous, which is contradictory. 39</page><page sequence="2">40 NOtS It will be argued that this antinomy equivocates on 'the present,' which is made possible by the fact that we have two different con- cepts of the present which work together in harness. Any satisfactory answer to the question, 'What is happening at present?', which is other than the claim that nothing is happen- ing at present, i.e. nothing of importance, will report the occurrence or obtaining of some event or state that takes or lasts for a finite time. To reply that S is qing (or is p) at present is to say that the process of S's oing (or the state of S's being c) has been going on (or lasting) from some time in the past up until the present. The duration of the past time in question will depend on what kind of a predicate 'q' is. Some predicates in addition carry a future tense commitment. The fact that whatever is going on at present has a finite duration suggests that the present has a finite duration. It is this concept of the durational present that is appealed to by the argument of the Thesis when it is claimed that whatever occurs or is present requires a finite time in which to do so. The concept of the durational present, however, presupposes that of the punctal present, which serves as the end of the past and the beginning of the future, in that every durational use of 'the present at the same time involves a punctal use which refers to this punctal divider. That S is cing at present means that S has been qing from some past time up until the present, in which the present is the punctal present. While there can be a purely punctal use of 'the present,' it is still the case that the concept of the punctal present presupposes that of the durational present, for there cannot be a temporal end or beginning which is not the beginning or end of some finite duration. The punctal present in our example may not serve as the end of S's (ing but only of some sub-phase of this process, since 'q' might be uncommited with respect to the future or carry definite commitments with respect to it. It is plain that the argument of the Antithesis appeals to the concept of the punctal present when it assumes that to be co-present is to be simultaneous. What has been said about the dual use of 'the present' holds also for 'now,' since we could just as well have said that S is qing now, rather than at present. Because every durational use of 'the present or 'now also involves a punctal use, it is easy to confound the durational with the punctal present and to create perplexity by demanding that the one have the same logic as the other. Augus- tine's famous puzzle about how any time could be long is an in- stance of this. The past and future cannot be long, since they are</page><page sequence="3">HAS THE PRESENT ANY DURATON? 41 the no-longer and the not-yet. But neither can the pre-sent be long, for reasons similar to those of the Antithesis. To use his own exam- ple, not only is one hundred years not present but 'neither is the year now current present," and similarly for any sub-interval of this year. Since 'current' is a synonym for 'present,' he is saying that 'neither is the year now present present,' which sounds paradoxical until we realize that two different concepts of the present are being utilized. Put non-paradoxically it amounts to saying that the year which is now durationally present is such that only one punctal moment of this year is punctally present. Findlay's therapeutic treatment of Augustine's puzzle failed to detect this equivocation. According to Findlay, by being forced to use 'now' in ever more narrow ways we might in desperation admit that in the strict sense of 'now' only a punctal occurrence can occur now. We shall feel perplexed when we try to talk about these punctal "occurrences" in the same way we talk about ordinary finite occurrences. We can dispel this perplexity by choosing to say of very brief occurrences either that they are present as a whole or that they take no time at all. We should not be worried about any inconsistency between our ways of talking about reasonably long occurrences and these very brief ones. 'It does not, in fact, matter, in all this choice of diction, what we say, provided only that we truly please ourselves.'2 This is hardly a happy solution, since we might choose a way of speaking that 'truly pleases' us but makes no sense. Fortunately, this desperation move is not required. The proper therapy is to point out that 'now' is used in both a durational and punctal sense and what meaningfully can be said and asked about the one kind of present cannot be said and asked about the other. Even if it should be discovered that, relative to a certain context, there is an event of minimal duration, it would not show that there is no punctal present; for it would only show that relative to this context there is an ultimately correct answer to what is durationally present. Thus, the existence of the punctal present is safe from any empirical discovery, e.g., the physicist's quest for a chronon event in quantum theory, or the psychologist's efforts to discover the minimal duration of a perceptual act or its content. 1 Confessions, Bk.

E.g., to say that I am perceiving x at present, regardless of how brief this act of per- ceiving be, even if it be one of minimal duration in the sense described above, is to report my perceiving of x from some past time up until the punctal present and to indicate the way in which I have been conceptualizing this perceiving from some past time up until the punctal present. The past moments in question may not coincide, since I may not have taken it to be x when I began to perceive it. The "synthetic unity" of my perceptual act results from the concepts I employ in my judgmental awareness-the predicates I would apply were I to report what I am perceiving. The difference between perceiving that x precedes y and perceiving x and then perceiving y is not that in the former case alone I "immediately" or simultaneously perceive x preceding y, in which case I would only be perceiving two objects as simultaneous, but rather consists in the way I conceptualize these perceivings, viz. when I perceive y, in the former case, I perceive it as following x; such an act, more- over, can as a whole be durationally present. Having shown how the distinction between the durational and punctal present can be utilized to dispell perplexities, it is time to consider some objections to this distinction, mainly concerning the viability of the concept of the punctual present. The first objection casts doubt on the viability of this concept because our language does not seem to contain rules or conventions for making a definite reference to such a present. If the present were punctal, then, ac- cording to Mundle, in order to use 'present' in its allegedly correct sense for purposes of communication, one would require a converntion to the effect that the moment indicated is that of the earlier (or later) boundary of the noise-token 'present', or of the sentence containing it. Plainly we do not, even as philosophers, employ any such convention.3 Several things will be said in reply to this reference-based objection. First, this argument proves too much; for if it follows that there is no punctal present because our language- does not contain rules or conventions for making definite reference to such a present, it would also follow that nothing begins or ends, the problem of 3 'How Specious Is the "Specious Present"?,' Mind, LXIII (1954), p. 44.</page><page sequence="5">IAS THE PRESENT ANY DURATON? 43 definitely referring to the punctal moment at which -something be- gins or ends being the same as that of definitely -referring to the punctal present. Second, let us assume for the sake of argument that our language contains no rules for making definite reference to the punctal present. From this it does not follow either that there is no such present or that our concept of such a present is bogus.4 Neither does it follow that the use of 'the present' or 'now' does not in fact refer to the punctal present, for it is important to distinguish between making an indefinite reference and referring to something indefinite. To speak of 'a man' is to make an indefinite reference to a man, not to refer to an indefinite man. Likewise it could be said that to speak of 'the present' is to make an indefinite reference to the punctal present and not to refer to an indefinite present. Since most speech acts are rather brief there is no need for purposes of assessing the truth of what is said to determine whether the punctal present denoted occurs at the beginning, within or at the end of the speech act.5 In granting that our language contains no rules for making definite reference to the punctal present we may have been granting too much. What unquestionably is true is that there is no single rule for determining in every context what punctal moment is the referent of a use of 'now.' But this does not mean that there are no linguistic practices and customs which determine how we are to interpret the punctal reference of 'now' in various contexts. In many contexts, probably the preponderance of them, the referent of 'now' is taken to be the time at which the utterance containing it ceases. This is because in these contexts the hearer does not know what statement is being made until the utterance is completed. E.g., if a sportscaster wanted to report that Jones is now running and in the middle of his utterance Jones should cease to do so, he would say something like, 'Jones is now ru. . No! He's just stopped running.' In cases in which a person speaks to himself the referent would be the moment at which his inner speech act begins, since a person usually knows what he is going to say when he begins to speak. 4 The viability of our concept of the punctal present is attested to by the ease with which we can think of time metrically and the practical useful- ness of so doing. 5 Because of the rules governing the use of tensed sentences, the use of a present tense sentence refers to a punctal time that occurs during the speech act; however, this time is not referred to as the time at which the speech act oc- curs, and thus there is nothing linguocentric about the present. For a more elaborate discussion of this see Chapter X of my book, The Language of Time (New York: 1968).</page><page sequence="6">44 sots The next -objection to be considered contends that if the present were punctal time could not pass, i.e., the present could not shift to ever later times. The first step in this polemic is to argue that there is no immediate punctal successor to a punctal present. This might be done in dilemma fashion by claiming that if there is an immediate punctal successor to the punctal present, these punc- tal moments are either contiguous or temporally separated. They could not be contiguous: if they were there would be no time be- tween them, and thus one could not be later than the other. But neither could they be temporally separated: for in shifting from the earlier to the later punctal moment the present would not pass through the intervening period of time, and thus there would be a period of time during which time does not pass. The passage of time could not be discontinuous or gappy, for then there would be times during which there is no time. The next step, which has been made famous by James and Whitehead6, involves the deployment of Zeno's Racecourse argu- ment to the passage of time itself: if the present were punctal, be- fore it advanced any interval of time into the future it would have to advance half of this interval, and before that half of this interval, and so on ad infinitum since, as argued above, there is no immediate successor to this punctal present. But this means that the punctal present could never get started on its mission of shifting to a later time. Like poor Achilles, it is permanently frozen at the starting blocks. The way out of this zenoian type paradox is to hold that the passage of time involves a discrete succession of atomic units each of a finite duration. According to Whitehead, there is a becoming of continuity but not a continuity of becoming. Before attempting to rebut this becoming-based objection, it should be pointed out that this way out of the paradox is not with- out its own difficulties. According to the atomic theory of becoming an event of finite duration becomes present all at once, not suc- cessively. But the 'becoming present' of an event supposedly con- sists in its occurring or happening. But then an event which encom- passes successive phases would occur or become present successively, and not all at once. The usual reply to this objection takes the path of obscurantism in which it is denied that the becoming present of an event is the same thing as its occurring, which leaves us with no iJames, Some Problems of Philosophy (London: 1948), p. 167ff., and Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: 1929), p. 53.</page><page sequence="7">HAS THE PBtSENT ANY DURAT[ON? 45 clear idea of what is now meant by the interrelated notions of an event and becoming. Fortunately, this paradox can be avoided by a doctrine that holds the present to be punctal, with becoming involving a dense succession of such punctal moments. The Racecourse argument will be considered first, and the results will then be applied to its temporal version. The Racecourse has been formulated so that the infinite regress of sub-runs comes either at the beginning or at the end: before the runner traverses the unit distance in a unit time he must traverse half of this distance, and before that half of this distance, and so on; or, before he traverses the whole distance he must traverse half of this distance, and then half of the remaining distance, and so on. Many have held that on either formulation it is not possible for the runner to succeed in running the unit distance in a unit time. For our purposes, the former version alone need be con- sidered. It will now be shown that there is an action type formula- tion of the Racecourse in which there would be a conceptual ab- surdity in an agent running the unit distance by going through the described infinite series of sub-runs. By an action we shall understand something done intentionally by an agent. The actions performed by an agent are such that the agent who performs them either can supply us with a recipe that guided his performance or he cannot, the latter being actions which he does without doing something else.7 Only the former actions will be considered, since our question is whether there is something conceptually absurd in a person attempting to run the unit distance by following the recipe which says that before you run the whole distance you must run half the distance, and before that half of that, and so on. The conceptual absurdity of this follows from the concept of an action-guiding recipe. Such a recipe is a finite-step recipe which will: (i) specify some initial action; (ii) indicate what subsequent actions are to be performed and in what discrete order or supply a rule for the performance of these actions; and (iii) specify the traits possessed by the final action in this sequence. E.g., I might go about doing my Christmas shopping by following this recipe: (i) go to any store and if I find something suitable for someone on my 7 The latter might be called recipe-basic actions. For reasons given by Annette Baier in her fine paper, 'The Search for Basic Actions,' forthcoming in the American Philosophical Quarterly, it would be unwise to speak of basic actions without specifying in what sense they are basic.</page><page sequence="8">46 NOoS- list buy it; (ii) after doing (i) always look for a suitable gift in the store nearest to the one I was at, never going to the same store twice; and (iii) follow rule (ii) until I- come to a. store at which I buy a present-for the final person on my list. Given our concept of an action-guiding recipe it would be conceptually absurd for a person to run through a unit distance in a unit time by following this recipe: before running the entire distance run half of it, and before that half of this distance, and so on ad infinitum.8 The reason is that this recipe does not specify any initial action on his part; and without an initial move there is no way in which he can apply a recursive rule. The action-guiding recipe that, most persons utilize specifies that one takes an initial step, and thereafter always take one more step until one takes a step which gets him to the end of the unit distance. Because it is conceptually absurd that (1) A person runs a unit distance by traversing each and every space in an infinite series of overlapping spaces which has no first member. in which the by-clause supplies his action-guiding recipe, it does not follow that (2) It is impossible that a person traverse (in some non-action sense) each and every space in this infinite series by running the unit distance. For (2) would be true if the person ran the unit distance in ac- cordance with some finite-step recipe, e.g. the one given at the end of the preceding paragraph, and space and time were dense in the way described in physical theory. Neither does it follow from (1) that (3) It is impossible for a physical object to traverse (in some non-action sense) the unit distance by traversing (in some non-action sense) every space in this infinite series. Since the traversal in this case is not an action, the by-clause does not supply an action-guiding recipe. (3) would follow from (1) if it were assumed that - 8 It would also be conceptually absurd for the person to make the run by following the recipe which tells him to first run half tlhe distance and thereafter always to run half of the remaining distance, for then the recipe does not specify the traits possessed by -the -final action in -this sequence and thus he would not know when to cease his efforts.</page><page sequence="9">HAS THE PRESENT ANY DURATION? 47 (4) Whatever a physical object can be represented as doing a person can be represented as doing as an action. which assumption is basic to all systems of anthropomorphic meta- physics, i.e. systems that try to explain all happenings in terms of concepts borrowed from the context of human experience and agency. E.g., Whitehead, in order to overcome the bifurcation be- tween life and mind, on the one hand, and the physical world, on the other, attempted to explain the workings of the latter in terms of the categories of the former; every real being or actual occasion has the properties of feeling, aim, prehension and satisfaction. But why should assumption (4) be accepted? And merely to ask this question suffices to undermine the Racecourse argument when it is used to show that not even a non-agent could traverse the unit distance in the described manner. It should now be clear what Whitehead is up to in his temporal deployment of the Racecourse argument. He is putting himself or some other agent in the place of the punctal present and asking what action-guiding recipe he could use in advancing to a later time. Since he finds that he-an agent-could not use one in which there is no initial doing, he assumes, in accordance with assumption (4), that neither could the present moment-a non-agent-advance to a later time without doing some initial action. But once again merely to question (4) suffices to destroy the argument.9 9 In preparing this paper I was helped by the critical comments of Myles Brand, Joseph Camp, Gerald Massey, and Nicholas Rescher.</page></plain_text>
