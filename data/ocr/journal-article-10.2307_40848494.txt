<plain_text><page sequence="1">Classical and Middle Armenian Owls There are five bird names in Classical Armenian which are generally, but imprecisely, translated as 'owl5. They are the bu, buêc, buiöak, JcasJcam, and possibly the ttaleln. Only the bu is con- tinued into Modern Armenian, being used loosely for any member of the family Strigidae1). The other terms have been lost from standard speech. This paper will discuss the use of these terms in Classical Armenian literature, and make some comments about their etymologies. Further, an effort will be made to give a more precise taxonomic designation to these five birds. There are six species of owls (a seventh possibility will be men- tioned later) that are commonly found in the area of historical Armenia. Since they are dependent on wooded areas, they have been consistently pushed northward during the last two millenia as the virgin growth has been harvested and not replaced. Those likely to be seen now are: 1. Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo); 2. Long-eared Owl (Asio otus); 3. Scops Owl (Otus scops); 4. Little Owl (Athene noctua) ; 5. Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) ; 6. Tawny Owl (Strix aluco). Of the five Armenian owl names, bu is by far the best sub- stantiated in literature. It appears three times in the Bible where it consistently replaces Gk. yAavf2). In Grigor Magistros3) (11th century) a statement is made about the temporal habits of owls (15) : giëerayacu bun ar arciwn i tudnjean mrc*i "a night-wandering owl competes with the eagle in the daytime". A passage from a fable by Mxit'ar Goã (12th century)4) describes the bu entering into delicate negotiations with the exalted eagle (Arak 123): Bu hreëtak arak'eac* ar ardw, ew xndreac* zdustr nora harsn, aselov : Du tudn)ean 1) The very common Barn Owl (Tyto alba), a member of the family Tyto- nidae, does not now appear in Asia Minor or the Caucasus. 2) According to d'Arcy Thompson, A Glossary of Greek Birds2, Oxford 1936, p. 76, Gk. yZavÇ represents any owl, but more commonly stands for the Little Owl (Athene noctuá). 3) This quote is taken from the NHB (cf. note 12), and is inadequately cited there. Its original source seems to be lost. 4) Afakk Mxitaray Gosi, Venice 1854. This edition further contains an index of the subjects of the fables (pp. 155-164). 9*</page><page sequence="2">132 John A. C. Greppin k'ajamartik es, ew es giSeroy; patSaóimk' i xnamut'iwn "An owl sent a messenger to an eagle, and asked for his daughter as a bride: 'You are diurnal and a brave warrior, and I am nocturnal ; we would be appropriate in-laws'". A Middle Armenian talaran from the fourteenth ( ? ) century by Yovhannës Episcopos5) again cites the bu: bun ku sf6*êr giëeravar, ' yorzam liner mvfn u xawar, ' erp* afawawtn mawtenar, ' na kurac'el dnknër i var. "The owl was taking a walk at night / while it was dark and black / but when morning drew near / he became blind and fell down". And finally, from a collection of discourses on the six days of creation 6) : ftfikank* ew bu ew hawalusn, ocawarasërk* ew zawarakeac'k* giëerayink' "bats and the owl and the pelican are nocturnal, lovers of darkness and dwellers in darkness". The etymology of bu presents some distinct problems. The root bu- fowP has a rather wide and peculiar distribution encompassing several major language families. In Indo-European it appears as Lat. bubo, büß1); Gk. ßvac, ßvCa; NPer. bum, büf; Krd. bum and Bulg. buh cowP. In Semitic we have Ar. bümm; Syr. bava eowP; and Ar. büh6) cmale owP. Further examples can be drawn from the Caucasian languages: Georgian bu, buvi, bui; Tush, bui; Chech. buhu; Laz. byu 'owP. Klimov9) also adds Megr. yu-; Chan byu-, (m)yu-, to which he assigns a proto-form of *b(y)u-. Thus there is a large representation that, with the exception of the Greek, Latin (via Greek?) and Bulgarian forms, is surprisingly areal, appearing in languages which had close cultural contact. 5) From two maa. in the Matenadaran; # 3595 and # 738. Other maa. have been published, notably in the newspaper Moaia (Constantinople) 1879, numbers 2478, 79, 81, and 94; and in the journal Erkragunt, Constantinople 1884. Some of the quatrains have been translated into French by A.

Emout, Lea elementa dialectaux du vocabulaire latin, Paris 1909, pp. 130-131) Lat. bufo has been concidered a dialectical form from an original *büdho-, which would also explain bubo on the same pattern as ruber and rufua. One could as well contend that bubõ merely shows affec- tionate reduplication. 8) Al-qamüa dl-muhit moShür ba auqiyänüa boalt, Constantinople 1874, vol. 3, p. 726. 9) G. A.

But, although its inception in a certain dialectical area might have been spontaneous, the wider distribution in culturally united spheres implies some sort of trans- ference through loan. Arm. bu, because of its shape, clearly cannot be genetically derived from IE *bu-, even if an IE *bu- had existed. A loan origin from Iranian, however, is quite possible for Armenian, especially in view of the bulk of Iranian ornithological vocabulary that has been transfered11). Further, there is an additional reason that will be discussed later with buêc. The buêc plays a lesser role in Armenian literature. The NHB12) cites a passage from Zenobius of Glax (5th century) which displays the bird in anthropomorphic terms: angelic' ew bdweók* patee* an zinew ' 'vultures and owls surrounded themselves with weapons". Later, Aristakës Lastivertc'i 13) points out the displeasing charac- teristics of the voice of the buêc : pvoxanak k'alc'rajaynufean ergoyn ayzm buê6ke ew ttalelunW dasagluxkc en ' 'instead of sweet-voiced song, now the buêók* and the ttalelunk* are the choirmasters". From the same talaran of Yovhannës Episkopos {supra) comes another quatrain : Bdbfêói aó'win è* alar, ¡ zaregakan loysvn ó'tesnayr, / in¥n giëern i ëur ku gayr9 ' zgoln u ztfus mardn yimanayr. "The eyes of the bdbfêo were not strong / he did not see the light of the sun / at night he went around / men thought he was a thief and a brigand". Though the form of bdbrêc is somewhat distinct from buêc, it would appear to be a legitimate variant. Reduplication is also seen in the Latin form (bubo), but the -r- is otherwise unknown. There are two principal questions surrounding the buêë; one is linguistic and the other is taxonomic. 10) H. Hübschmann, Armenische Grammatik, vol. 1, Leipzig 1897, p. 430, and more recently, J. André, Les noms d'oiseau en latin, Paris 1967, p. 45. n) I have discussed elsewhere some Armenian bird names, some of which are of Iranian origin ("Four Classical Armenian Game Birds", RE Arm 11, 1975 - 76 forthcoming).

Elsewhere14) I pro- posed that -êó was a diminuative suffix of moderate productivity. It functioned similarly with -io, -uó, and -aó, all of which are found frequently with words representing some type of small flora or fauna15). However, if we are to view -êó here as a diminuative suffix, forming thus a word for a 'small owl9, the extended suffix of buióak (*-ëcak), another owl name, attains a level of suspicious redundancy. There is adequate reason to propose that the suffix -êó of buêó is not a diminuative on the order of -ió, -uó, and -aó. Arm. dufêó is another bird name which appears with word-final -êó. It is a type of plump game bird; the francolín or partridge16), and derived from NPer. durräj 'francolín9. Acknowledging thus that Arm. -êó can parallel NPer. -ãf, and in view of the possibility that Arm. bu might well be of Iranian derivation, it would appear possible to propose that Arm. buêó is a loan word from a now lost Iranian *buãj 'a type of owl9. The removal of -êó from the semantic class of 'diminuative9 accords much better with the clear evidence of -ióak. A double diminuative suffix, though possible, is somewhat suspect in ornithological nomenclature. Having made this proposal for the value of -êó, it is now possible to consider a more precise definition than simply 'a type of owl9. The AB11) describes the buêó simply as 'ira9. Neither the NHB nor Jaxjaxian18) make any significant added comment. Further, the literary passages quoted above contribute little more than acknow- ledging that owls do not have pleasant voices, and that they are prone to defending themselves. Bedrossian19), however, makes a precise statement, saying that the buêó is a 'horned owl9, and cor- respondingly the buiëak is a 'little horned owl9. Unfortunately, 14) "Comments on Some Armenian Suffixes of Substratum Origin", LBllß, 1973, pp. 65-71, esp. pp. 68-69; Classical Armenian Nominal Suffixes, a Historical Survey, Vienna 1975, p. 45 (= HA 1974: 185). 15 ) In addition to buëë, one should also note darunaó 'corn poppy' ; dafnia 'endive* ; hatió 'kernal' ; bcië 'cell of a honey comb' ; buóuÓ 'husk of a chest- nut'. That -Ve has a diminuative value is clearly demonstrated by the doublet hatik/hatió 'kernal', and by dafnia 'endive' which would be derived from the adjective dafn 'bitter'. 16) Not, as Bedrossian says, 'heathcock or venison' ; cf. Greppin REArm 11, 1975 - 76: forthcoming. 17) Arjefn bafaran haykazean lezui, Venice 1865. 18) H. A. Jaxjaxian, Bafgirk' hay ew italakan, Venice 1837. 19) M. Bedrossian, New Dictionary Armenian-English, Venice 1879.</page><page sequence="5">Classical and Middle Armenian Owls 135 Bedrossian gives no source to support his definition; further, Bedrossian's glosses for other bird names have been frequently wrong in the extreme20). The answer would seem to lie in the distinction imbedded in the use of -ëo as opposed to the non-suffixed form. Clearly there is some distinctive difference between these two types of owls: bu refers to any owl; buëè refers to a significant deviation. The most marked distinction between owls is that of 'horned' owls and 'non-horned5 owls, the ranking suggested by Bedrossian but lacking in other lexicographers. Of the six owls mentioned above that appear in historical Armenia, three have distinctive feather tufts on their heads which are called 'ears9 or 'horns'21). They are the Eagle Owl, the Long-eared Owl, and the Scops Owl. Further, in accordance with the data imbedded in -ëâ as opposed to -i6ak, there is a significant difference in size between these owls. The Eagle Owl attains a length of 27 inches, the largest of the European owls. The Scops Owl, on the other hand, stands only eight inches high, and is the smallest owl found in historical Armenia22). Thus it is quite likely that Bedrossian was correct in this iden- tification of bueó and buiëak. Arm. bu is a general term for any owl ; bueö and buicak are distinctively different, their ears being the most significant divergence from the standard owl morphology. Further, the marked differentiation in size between the Eagle Owl (27 inches) and the Scops Owl (8 inches) would be adequate cause to call them respectively the buëè and the buicak23). Let us now turn to the kaskam. Though lexical sources are vague, a passage from Mxit'ar Goä seems to imply that the kaskam is a folk term for the buiöak (Arak 142): bdwicak alalakë kos, ew miwsn ose kam; sakayn oëe kay, ayl ffuc'eal aylur erf ay "a Scops Owl 20) Bedrossian calls the kiwiw a 'cuckoo'. Yet literature describes it with a crest and Modern Armenian continues the word as 'Lapwing (Vanellus vanellu8)' Game bird nomenclature is also in a state of disarray, cf. note 16 above. 21) The Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus), in spite of its name, does not have readily discernible ear tufts. 22 ) This distinction between the general bu and the more specific buëc conforms well with Greek where yXav^ is the general term, and ßvag refers to the Eagle Owl or the Long-eared Owl. 23) In view of the distinct size difference between the buëë and the buiÓak, we might easily assume that the Long-eared Owl also was covered by the term buêó. This would conform well with the Greek data in note 22 above.</page><page sequence="6">136 John A. C. Greppin cries kas ['you are9] and another says kam [CI am9], but neither is, flying up it goes elsewhere"24). And, again from Yovhannës Episkopos25), another poem describes the eyes of the owl, eyes which in folk mythology are considered blood-shot: Kasuham n kaxuel dnd earn i var, ' yaiïic'n ariwn kafkfayr, ' ku kan&amp;êr hazar zinahar. / Mek mi ë'erfayr afnoyr i var. "The Jcaskam hung from a tree upside down / blood dripped from its eyes / it was calling for a thousand rescues. / And no one would take it down". Though the poem is rich in hyperbole, it none the less continues the deathly impression that the owl, particularly the horned owl, can convey. In Greek it was ßvac, rather than the more general yXav!;, that was rich in evil overtones. Thompson26) points out that Dio Cassius regarded the ßvac as a bird which bore evil omens. Latin literature continued the same theme. In Vergil (Aen. IV. 462) the bubõ speaks ferali carmine. Ovid (Met. V. 550) says that the bubo gives dirum omen to men; it is prof anus (VI. 431) and funer eus (X. 453). Thus, if the kaskam is to be related to the buióak, it fulfills the characteristics of the horned owls that people commonly perceive. Further, it is quite reasonable for the buiöak to have a special folk name since the Scops Owl is the most commonly seen of the owls, appearing close to human habitation in gardens, groves and ruins. Further, it is somewhat diurnal. We may thus review the possible taxonomic conclusions: Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo). ì _v Ì Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) j ue I horned owls. 7 Scops Owl (Otus scops). -&gt; buióak, kaskam J I Little Owl (Athene noctua). ) , , ou , j r' i / * • ¿i x non-horned , , Short-eared ou , j Owl r' i (Asio / * • flammeus). ¿i x &gt; , Tawny Owl (Strix aluco). J One species remains, the ttaleln, and we cannot be entirely sure even that it is an owl. I know of only one reference to it in literature, 24 ) B. Chookaszian, Deputy Director of the Matenadaran, has suggested in a private communication that Arm. kaskam might be derived from NPer. kãskine "a type of song bird; a swallow, a bee-eater or magpie". Though NPer. kãskine could well have been remodeled by the Armenian speaker into the pleasantly punning form of Arm. kaskam, it would be difficult to reconcile the Armenian gloss of cowP with the glosses for NPer. kãskine. Further, the glosses for kãskine are so varied that one would tend to disregard them as fanciful. 25) Talaran, cf. note 5. 26) Op. cit., pp. 66-67.</page><page sequence="7">Classical and Middle Armenian Owls 137 and that is the passage of the eleventh century History of Aristarkës Lastivertc'i mentioned above where ttaleln is cited parallely with buë6. Only Bedrossian gives it a specific lable: 'screech owl', a distinct impossibility since the Screech Owl is not found outside of North America. Bedrossian no doubt added the 'screech9 because of the alleged unpleasing voice mentioned by Aristakës, the pre- sumable source of his definition. Jaxjaxian is more cautious and says only 'a sort of bird9. AB also specifies it as ea bird9, but adds that it has a fbent tail9. AB does not say from what source this additional information was derived. We may assume that ttaleln is an owl only if we can assume that Aristakës selected two similar birds for his r choirmasters9. There seems to be some cause to suspect that he did so since immediately after the passage mentioning the bueök' and the ttaleln, he mentions parallely the tatrak and the alavmi (lines 12-14): Ew p'oxanak salmosakan nuagac'n tatrak ew alavmi er gen i nma; dst margar ein k'alc'rajaynufeamb kardal zjags iwreanc* "And instead of psalmodie music, the turtle dove and the pigeon sing to him; they call their young with the sweet-voicedness of the prophet". Because of Aristakës' consistent parallelisms, it is more likely that the ttaleln is indeed an owl rather than some other species of bird with a loud voice. Further identification27) however would be impossible unless we consider the aspect of 'bent tail9 mentioned by AB, By 'bent tail9 one assumes that AB is referring to a bird whose tail does not always continue straight from its body, but rather may be cocked up at an angle. Of the European owls, such a description can be applied to the Hawk Owl (Surnia ulula) and the Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum). Though the standard European bird books place both owls somewhat to the north of historical Armenia, the more recent (and, for the southern USSR, more accurate) monograph by Kuznecov28) states that the Hawk 27) Linguistic means cannot help us here. Adjarian (H. Aöaryan, Hayerën armatákan bafaran, Yerevan 1926-37; second edition Yerevan 1971) does not mention the bird, and no etymology seems possible. As a suffix, -ein exists with aseln 'needle', IE *aUi- + *-lonf but this seems hardly pertinent to ttaleln. 28) B. A. Kuznecov, OpredeliteV pozvonoönyx zivotnyx fauny SSSR, east' 2, pticy, Moscow 1974, p. 139. The major Soviet works on Armenian ornitho- logy are now quite out of date (A. F. Ljajster and G. V. Sosnin, Materialy po ornitofaune Armjanskoj SSR, Yerevan 1942; and S. K. Dal' and G.V. Sosnin, OpredeliteV ptic Armjanskoj SSR, Yerevan 1947).</page><page sequence="8">138 John A. C. Greppin Owl is found in the Caucasus29). Taking into further consideration the large population shifts in eastern Anatolia and the sub-Caucasus since the eleventh century, and the concomitant reduction of forested area, it is quite possible that the Hawk Owl was once found further south. Thus, if the range can be logically extended, and the aspects assigned by AB are pertinent to an owl, we can hypothesize that the ttaleln and the Hawk Owl were one and the same. Concluding, we must note that folk taxonomy for any group of animals as generally varied and indistinct as birds is often most unreliable. Further, a bird known by one name in one locality will frequently be named differently elsewhere. But, owls are extra- ordinarily distinctive; it is difficult for them to be mistaken for another species. We can thus confidently assume a good deal of consistency in the use of these different terms. It is only the ttaleln that evades a sure designation, a species for which we have too little information to make a precise identification. Department of English, Cleveland State University Cleveland, Ohio 44115 John A. C. Greppin 29) Owls are difficult birds to cite precise ranges for since they frequently turn up, in large numbers, in places where they are quite unexpected. Thus, range listings for owls are inexact at best.</page></plain_text>
