Greco-Roman Culture and the Galilee of Jesus, by Mark A. Chancey, offers a fascinating revision of the traditional picture of the thoroughly Hellenized and at least partially Romanized world in which Jesus lived. Building on recent scholarship concerning the concrete processes of Romanization, Chancey offers compelling archaeological evidence for the material culture of the first century to suggest that Galilee was not at all like neighboring Judea, which had been Romanized through the long reign of Herod the Great (37-4 BCE). In contrast, Chancey argues, the Galilee saw little direct Roman presence?and by cultural</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 145 implication in the eastern provinces (43), little Hellenization?until after the failed Jewish Revolts of 66-70 and 132-135 CE. The primary social institution for Romanization was the army, including its auxiliary units of non-Italian non-citizens. We see such auxiliary units stationed alongside Roman legions in Syria to the north (where there were normally four legions, 48) and shortly thereafter, in Egypt to the south (which had one legion in 70 CE, 61). By the time of the First Jewish Revolt, the main Roman garrisons were in Jerusalem and Caesarea (48). But the Galilee did not come under direct Roman control until after the death of Agrippa I in 44 CE (56), and (excepting Caesarea) did not receive a permanent Roman garrison until well after the First Revolt; it was based in the Jezreel Valley at headquarters called Legio, perhaps as early as 117 CE, but possibly not until after the Second Revolt (63-70). Roman garrisons, Roman legionaries, and Roman auxiliaries were respon sible for Romanization in various ways; the key is that they made the places they occupied look and function more "Roman-ly." Indigenous people who landed on a military career were trained in Roman languages, Roman virtues, and Roman civics. Auxiliaries were normally granted citizenship when they were mustered out (49), and often settled in new Roman colonies. Vespasian created such a colony at Emmaeus, and later elevated Caesarea to that status (61); Hadrian established the colony of Aelia Capitolina in Jerusalem just prior to the Second Revolt (62). Other Roman colonies would follow, but not until considerably later and not many in the Galilee. These garrisons were respon sible for civic buildings, aqueducts, and roads. Chancey offers an especially interesting interpretation of Roman roads, whose milestones were inscribed with the reigning emperor's name in Latin and distances to the nearest city or cities below it in Greek. Chancey insists that these "milestone inscriptions were made for propagandistic purposes" (66), as evidenced by the fact that they were rarely placed in "sparsely settled areas." When and how did these Roman legions arrive? It all began as an unintended consequence of the Senate-sponsored war against Mediterranean piracy in Crete and Cilicia, prosecuted by Pompey the Great; he arrived in Palestine in 63 BCE (43-44). The customary waves of conquest and coloniza tion soon followed: (1) the end of the Hasmonean dynasty; (2) proxy rule of Palestine by the Romans through the Herodian client kings; (3) the piecemeal annexation of the area and, with it, the implementation of direct Roman rule through prefects and procurators; (4) the establishment of a Roman military presence; (5) the destruction of the Jewish temple; and (6) the slow emergence of rabbinic Judaism (43, numeration mine). Jesus lived and died in the tumultuous borderland between stages 2 and 3; Romanization did not occur until stages 4 through 6, which took place much later in the Galilee than elsewhere for dynastic reasons. That is the heart of Chancey's revisionary hypothesis.</page><page sequence="3">146 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Pompey arrived through Syria and intervened in the dynastic struggles between two Hasmonean aspirants: Aristobulus and Hyrcanus. Pompey sided with Hyrcanus, nominated him as high priest, but placed Palestine under the Syrian governor (44). The fourth such governor (Aulus Gabinius, 57-55 BCE) reorganized the Palestinian map into five regions, each with a ruling council (at Jerusalem, Gadara, Amathas, Jericho, and Sepphoris), then placed the region under the rule of Antipater. Julius Caesar later made Antipater the epitropos of Judea, and in 47 BCE Antipater passed rule on to his two sons: Phasel in Judea and Herod in Galilee (45). Later Herod would serve as Syrian governor and as tetrach in Judea with his brother. But a Parthian invasion in 40 BCE resulted in the death of his brother Phasel, and the rout of his own army; Herod fled to Rome (46), where he would have had a highly influential encounter with the massive rebuilding then underway in the imperial city (74-82). The Roman Senate made Herod king of Judea in 40 BCE. He returned to Ptolemais in 39 BCE, assembled his army, and was established in Jerusalem by 37 BCE. He died in 4 BCE, at which point Augustus divided the kingdom of Palestine among his three sons: Antipas took the Galilee; Archelaus took Judea, Idumea, and Samaria; and Philip took the northern territories and the Golan (46). Later, in 39 CE, Agrippa convinced the emperor Caligula of Antipas's treason; Antipas was exiled and replaced by Agrippa himself. When the latter died in 44 CE, the Galilee was folded into Judea and placed under direct Roman rule for the very first time (47). What this all means, for Chancey, is that Galilee was still a very Jewish place in Jesus' lifetime, bearing few of the direct marks so evident in surround ing territories of the influence of Hellenistic culture or of direct Roman rule. It was neither garrisoned nor colonized, boasted few Greco-Roman architec tural or art-historical monuments, little epigraphic evidence of widespread bilingualism or trilingualism (excepting the roads?), and no Roman coinage with imperial imagery until relatively late. In short, Jesus's Galilee simply was not a "Greco-Roman" place, as Syria and Judea arguably were. This is the conclusion of the first two chapters. In chapter 3, Chancey argues that the archaeological record offers precious little evidence of Greco-Roman architectural forms in the Galilee until the reign of Antipas. In other words, neither Pompey nor Gabinius nor even Herod built in Galilee, as Herod did so dramatically in Judea. Antipas did build in the Galilee, especially at Sepphoris (the city of some 8,000-12,000 inhabitants was laid out on a Greek grid with prominent civic markers like agorae, basilicae, aqueducts, baths, an akropolis, and later, even a theater), and at Tiberias, a city he founded on the Sea of Galilee (roughly 6,000-12,000 inhabitants strong, it has been less excavated because the modern city stands atop the ruins, though we know it had a stadium). Antipas also built elsewhere, like Magdala/Taricheae, which had a hippodrome by the 60s CE. But there was no such building in the northern Galilee, and very limited building anywhere else, until the arrival of long-term Roman garrisons (the subject of chapter 4, 100-121, with special attention paid to subsequent changes in synagogue construction).</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 147 In chapter 5, Chancey takes up the much-debated question of whether Greek was widely spoken in the Galilee in the first-century CE. Chancey worries that most reasoning up to now has been circular: "we know Galilee was Hellenized because Greek was spoken there; we know Greek was often spoken because Galilee was extensively Hellenized" (122). The heart of his revi sionary hypothesis hinges on identifying the geographical and chronological mistakes that have plagued previous studies. Scholars have tended to assume that the Galilee developed in much the same way as Judea and Syria did, and scholars have tended to "lump together . . . artifacts from a range of centuries to shed light on the first century" (124). What we know, Chancey argues, is that Aramaic was the primary spoken language in the Galilee (124), and that literacy rates were likely fairly low (143), making first-century inscriptions harder to read and of limited evidentiary value. The most worrisome piece of counter-evidence, Chancey admits, are 31 catacombs at Beth Shearim (145-149), a burial site for Galilean Jews, the elite of whom seemed to prefer Greek to Aramaic inscriptions, often took Greek names for themselves, and occasionally invoked Greek concepts like Hades and Moira. Dismissing the importance of what he calls the "epigraphic habit" (141) of a region, Chancey argues somewhat curiously that these inscriptions do not necessarily imply that the dead or their families could actually read Greek (147-148), and he further insists that the dating of such inscriptions?whether in synagogues or burial sites?is consistently later than the first century. Most synagogue inscriptions at Beth Shearim are from the third and fourth century, for instance (148nl39, though without explanation of how such dating was secured). In chapter 6, Chancey turns to the numismatic record, since the local minting of coins is often the best way to trace how a region enabled "Hellenistic, Roman and local tastes [to be] combined" (166). No coins were minted in the Galilee until the first-century CE (167), and not even Sepphoris or Tiberias minted what Chancey calls "civic coins" until after Jesus's death (184). The first such coins were minted at Tiberias in 53 CE (Sepphoris followed suit in 68 CE, 186). What is fascinating about these coins (in addition to their Greek inscriptions, I should add, which is glossed too quickly at 185) is the absence of figural representation, and the widespread use of palm branches instead. Under Trajan (98-117 CE), things changed; coins from this period minted at Sepphoris and Tiberias both depicted the imperial image and divine images of Tyche and Hygeia (188-189). From then on, civic coins minted in the Galilee looked much like other Roman coins. The Herodians had already minted bronze coins designed to demonstrate their "considerable autonomy" (177). And whereas Herod avoided the use of anthropomorphic or zoomorphic imagery (excepting an eagle, 179n64), his son Philip's coins bore imperial imagery. Chancey's point is that, by contrast, Antipas's Galilean coins (the first was struck at either Sepphoris or Tiberias in 1 CE, with subsequent coins coming from Tiberias, 180) contained imperial names and inscriptions but no images. The first Galilean coins to boast an imperial image were minted under Agrippa I in 40/41 CE (likely also minted at Tiberias, 182). This is early, but still not in Jesus's lifetime.</page><page sequence="5">148 Journal of the American Academy of Religion If Galilean coins lacked figural representation, then Greco-Roman art also failed to make significant inroads in the Galilee until the second and third centuries (this is Chancey's conclusion in chapter 7, 193-220). Gesturing to the biblical prohibition of "graven images" (Exod. 20:4-6; Deut. 4:15-18), Chancey agrees with Steven Fine that Jewish art in the first century should be called "anti-idolic" rather than "aniconic" (195, mention of Kalman Bland's The Artless Jew [Princeton 2000] would have enhanced this discussion). The point is that first-century Jews would have been resistant to the visual depic tion of the divine, but not to all figural representation, especially in domestic rather than public space (a fact that seems to run counter to the evidence from coins). This chapter focuses first on Galilean domestic space. Admitting that frescoes and mosaics had made inroads in the Galilee by the first-century CE (196), Chancey pays special attention to a first-century mosaic from a house in Magdala that depicted fish and fishing boats (197-198). But he says no more, preferring to reiterate his central contention that the sea change in the religious culture of Galilee took place in the third century, as we see most clearly at Sepphoris (198-201) and Tiberias (201-204). In both cities, Dionysus became a surprising and prominent figure, most notably on the famous synagogue floor mosaic at Tiberias. That said, we never see statues in the Galilee (204-210), not even in the Byzantine period. So the question of figural art is complicated, and is under-represented in first-century Galilee by any reason able comparison with its surroundings. The book is clearly written, forcefully argued, and will become an import ant resource for up-to-date evidence of the archaeological record. The book tends to draw most of its conclusions about the Galilee, perhaps too many of them and too generally (cf. 224-225), from two sites: Sepphoris and Tiberias. And while this is due in part to the scarcity of other archaeological evidence, the book's bibliography (236-274) and notes indicate a heavy reliance on the archaeologists at work on these two sites, Sepphoris in particular (Eric M. and Carol I. Meyers, Ehud Netzer, and James F. Strange). The least convincing chapter is also the longest, concerning the extent of Greek language use in first-century Galilee, but overall this is a superb and provocative study that successfully alters the scholarly landscape, through its thoughtful attention to the only quasi-Romanized landscape of first-century Galilee. doi:10.1093/jaarel/lfn099 Advance Access publication January 6, 2009 Louis A.
