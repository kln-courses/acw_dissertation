In sixteenth-century usage, "case" might signify a law case, the grammatical form of a word, the garments that clothe the hu- man body, or, as these quotations emphasize, a woman's genitalia.1 The complexities of the term's connotations in the English vernacular cut across these various senses of "case," as it is a word which registers as either learned or vulgar (or both), depending on the context. We can best apprehend this nexus of meanings by considering Mistress Quickly's interruption of a Latin lesson in The Merry Wives of Windsor (JS/LWWT). This scene turns the confluence of the terms of grammar and gender into 173</page><page sequence="2">174 JENNY C.MANN broad comedy when Mistress Quickly overhears Will Page's schoolmaster request the recitation of the "genitive case plural" of " Horum , harum, horum Mistress Quickly, who knows no Latin and thus hears only the word "whore," exclaims, "Vengeance of Jenny's case! Fie on her! Never name her child, if she be a whore" ( MWWt 4.1.50-54). Here an unedu- cated woman interrupts the orderly exchanges of humanist pedagogy with an inappropriately vulgar understanding of the terms of Latin gram- mar. In other words, as Patricia Parker argues, the problem of confusion between a Latin grammatical "case" and a vulgar female "case" attaches to unruly female speech, or what we might otherwise call the mother tongue.2 This scene suggests how the use of "case" as a slang term for the female "cut" potentially taints the English language with vulgarity in its most derogative sense.3 Puttenham's allusion to the "plainest cases" in his English rhetorical manual, coupled with his derisive reference to the inadequate knowledge of his lady students, reinforces this reading.4 I begin with this brief analysis of the term "case" and its use in Shake- spearean drama because it suggests how discussions of linguistic form open out onto cultural concerns that might otherwise seem to be distinct from questions of language and rhetoric.5 In this essay I will argue that the formation of a vernacular rhetoric in the sixteenth century becomes linked to the constitution of gender and sexual desire through the trans- lation of a figure of speech responsible for manipulating grammatical "case": enallage, or what Puttenham's Arte of English Poesie renames the "Figure of exchange." Beginning in the mid-sixteenth century, a se- ries of English "rhetorical manuals" attempt to translate classical figures of speech into the vernacular language.6 These rhetorics typically pro- vide English translations of the figures as well as examples of their use in vernacular writing: defining metaphor, for example, as "when the like is signified by the like ... a similitude contracted into one word," as in Philip Sidney's twenty-third sonnet, "Alas the race /Of all my thoughts, hath neither stop, nor start, /But onely Stellaes eyes, and Stellaes hart."7 However, not all of all the classical figures of speech were so easily ac- commodated in the vernacular, and enallage proved one of the most resistant to translation. Enallage manipulates grammatical accidents, substituting one case, person, gender, or tense for another, and it does not have any obvious function in a noninflected language.8 Yet despite its unworkability in the vernacular, enallage and its subfigure antipto- sis appear in four English rhetorics published between 1550 and 1650.</page><page sequence="3">The "Figure of Exchange" 175 Its periodic inclusion in vernacular handbooks of rhetoric signifies their desire to accommodate every aspect of the Latin style manual, no matter how intractable. Despite their eagerness to acquire the tools of Latin eloquence on behalf of the English mother tongue, many sixteenth-century rhetori- cal manuals worry over the implications of their attempts to translate classical rhetoric into the vernacular language, particularly the concern that their handbooks will level social distinctions within the larger com- munity of English speakers. In fact, vernacular rhetorics are especially vulnerable to charges of social subversion because they make rhetorical device available to all comers, demystifying the language of kings while giving common Englishmen the means to criticize their betters. The "Fig- ure of exchange" also invokes the problem of social leveling, focusing our attention on how the translation of classical rhetorical forms reverses the masculinizing work of Latin language instruction and combines male and female into one "common" gender. Enallage presents itself as the locus from which to explore the complicated gender effects of English rhetoric because the figure's unworkability signifies, quite literally, the troubling absence of gender distinctions within vernacular grammar.9 In addition, through its manipulation of grammatical gender and case, enallage em- ploys the very taxonomies through which early modern culture already expressed the gendered relationship between Latin and English. English translations in the period were said to decline from their Latin originals, and early modern grammars argued, idiosyncratically, that the feminine gender declines from the masculine in classical grammar.10 English, the "mother" tongue, the language spoken by women and children, was un- derstood to be subordinate to Latin, the "father tongue," the language of adult men. Furthermore, the lack of visible noun inflection in English grammar provided evidence of its decline because it prevented English writers from accommodating the vernacular to the metric demands of classical verse. In short, the impotence of enallage in English writing re- flects an absence of grammatical distinction mirrored by the vernacular's lack of social distinction, as well as its inferiority to Latin art. The "Figure of exchange" thus figures (and is figured by) a difference between Latin and English that stands as gendered. As a discursive structure that does not maintain grammatical distinc- tions - indeed, as a vernacular figure of speech operating within a gram- mar that cannot recognize differences of gender and case - the "Figure</page><page sequence="4">176 JENNY C.MANN of exchange" can help us comprehend other early modern figures caught between the categories of male and female, subject and object. This is because although English grammar lacks the verbal accidents that would enable enallage to operate in the vernacular, many poetic and dramatic works nevertheless imagine an English figure - that is, a person - that undergoes a change of case. Indeed, this is a central device of the early modern stage. As I will argue, the translation of enallage into the "Figure of exchange" produces moments of exchange in two imaginative works that stage a particular kind of gender disorder: the production of figures of "common" or "epicene" gender, bodies that could be either male or female and yet are also neither. The grammatical exchanges produced by the "Figure of exchange" give form to the beloved subject of Shake- speare's twentieth sonnet, known as the "Master Mistress," and also alter the "case" of multiple characters in Ben Jonson's Epicene , or The Silent Woman. Shakespeare's lyric and Jonson's play do not rely upon what we might call physiological correlates to express their gender disorders, and the application of the limited taxonomy of bodily genders cannot account for the variety of exchanges in their texts. Rather, the terms of grammati- cal gender and case constitute the disorderly forms of the Master Mistress and the Lady Epicene: these texts dramatize the "Figure of exchange" in bodies that shift between "he" and "she," "subject" and "object," "Mas- ter" and "Mistress." Thus although the figure enallage reveals a gender problem endemic to English rhetoric, highlighting the debased status of the vernacular vis-à-vis Latin, its accommodation in Shakespeare's sonnet and Jonson's play gives the figure a new valence. Such works reveal how the English enallage' s ability to exchange grammatical case renders the figure sexually attractive, the object of many sorts of vernacular desire. Translating Enallage into English Your figures that worke auricularly by exchange, were more obseruable to the Greekes and Latines for the brauenesse of their language, ouer that our is, and for the multiplicitie of their Grammaticali accidents, or verbali affects, as I may terme them, that is to say, their diuers cases, moodes, tenses, genders, with vari- able terminations, by reason whereof, they changed not the very word, but kept the word, and changed the shape of him onely, vsing one case for another, or tense, or person, or gender, or number, or moode. We, hauing no such varietie of accidents, haue little or no vse of this figure. - Puttenham, The Arte of English Poesie</page><page sequence="5">The "Figure of Exchange " 1 77 Both Latin and English rhetorics insist that the constructions of enallage alter only the "shape" of a word, not its signification. Enallage thus pro- vides rhetors with a range of grammatically different yet (purportedly) semantically equivalent verbal constructions, supplying a means for ver- bal variation and amplification in Greek and Latin. The figure appears prominently in Erasmus's De Copia, which describes enallage's uses as "infinitely various . . . [for] there are as many possible ways of changing as there are grammatical forms of a word."11 Such morphological variation remains largely unavailable in the vernacular, and more than any other sixteenth-century rhetoric, Puttenham's Arte acknowledges the difficulty in applying enallage to English speech. Like Erasmus, Puttenham pre- sents the "Figure of exchange" as a scheme that manipulates the "shape" or exterior of a word, its "case" rather than its signification, while also admitting that English has "no such varietie of accidents." Given what we know about the social function of fashion in the sixteenth century, we should be immediately suspicious of this declaration that changes of "shape" or "case" do not alter the meaning of words. In a culture in which dress constitutes the semiotic system according to which personal identity becomes publicly legible, the inability of English words to distin- guish themselves through the attire of grammatical accidents presents an obstacle to vernacular aspiration. As Puttenham explains in his chapter on poetic decorum, "it is comely that euery estate and vocation should be knowen by the differences of their habit: a clarke from a lay man: a gentleman from a yeoman: a souldier from a citizen, and the chiefe of euery degree from their inferiours, because in confusion and disorder there is no manner of decencie."12 Without a system of grammatical dress, English speech may not be able to distinguish itself and prevent such confusion and disorder. The attempt to identify grammatical accidents as nonessential exterior shapes also emerges in the term "braueness," which Puttenham uses to distinguish between English and the ancient languages. In the sixteenth century "braueness," or "bravery," signifies ostentatious show or splendor, especially as it relates to fashion or apparel.13 "Bravery" denotes adorn- ment or embellishment, something that might capture the interest of an observer. Yet the term also connotes mere show, as opposed to actual worth. Puttenham's distinction between the bravery of the ancients and the simplicity of the English thus might assume a range of opposed mean- ings. The grammatical embellishments of the Greek and Latin tongues</page><page sequence="6">178 JENNY C.MANN allow rhetors and poets to increase the beauty and fashion of the lan- guage, and they provide a means for cosmetic enhancement unavailable in the English vernacular; however, the manipulation of these "verbali affects" might be disparaged as empty show. Bravery denotes courage or valor, but it also signifies false bravado. Furthermore, although brav- ery might seem to be a masculine virtue in its reference to courage and daring, the term's connection to fashion and embellishment also associ- ates it with what were often understood to be feminine concerns.14 Like the "Figure of exchange," "brauenesse" is alternately both masculine and feminine. The union (or, perhaps, confusion) of masculine and feminine virtue in the "braueness" of the ancient tongues evokes a worrisome possibil- ity faced by ancient and early modern rhetors alike, that is, that the or- naments of rhetoric might be effeminizing. Wayne Rebhorn argues that even before English writers began to translate rhetoric into the vernac- ular, Roman and Renaissance rhetors were already nervous about the emasculating effects of rhetoric, particularly since rhetorical eloquence might be mistaken for idle talk, which is stereotypically female.15 The traditional identification of rhetorical ornament with cosmetics, a dispar- aging comparison first articulated in Plato's Górgias , further associates the rhetorical art with feminine concerns. Cicero and Quintilian respond to this problem by producing an image of Roman rhetoric as an art of combat and competition, while displacing the problem of idleness and loquacity onto the Graeculi , or "Greeklings." Rebhorn explains that this diminutive identifies the Greeks as boys or boy-men, and so evokes a vision of passive, and thus effeminizing, sodomitic activity from which proper Roman rhetoric can be distinguished.16 Renaissance rhetorics adopt these very concepts when they denounce overmuch concern with style and adornment as effeminizing, but they also diverge from their Roman predecessors in presenting the relationship between rhetor and audience not in republican terms but as the relationship between ruler and subject.17 Through his eloquence the rhetor becomes, in a passage from Henry Peacham's Garden of Eloquence (1593), "emperour of mens minds &amp; affections, and next the omnipotent God in the power of per- swasion."18 This fantasy of imperial power obscures the socially depen- dent position of the humanists who transmitted the art of eloquence to Renaissance Europe, most of whom were employed as teachers. In other words, even before it is translated into the historically degraded English</page><page sequence="7">The "Figure of Exchange" 179 vernacular, the art of rhetoric produces a socially doubled, sexually am- biguous subject position for its practitioners; it encompasses both mascu- line and feminine characteristics, while rendering its practitioners both king and subject. Consequently, Rebhorn designates the hermaphrodite as the appropriate figure for Renaissance rhetoric, selecting a sexually composite figure to communicate the hybridizing effects of rhetorical practice.19 Yet although the hermaphrodite suggests the sexual double- ness instituted by the art of rhetoric, it does not account for the myriad other exchanges endemic to English rhetorical practice. In its attempt to inscribe Latin grammatical distinctions within a vernacular language that does not differentiate among cases, or subject positions, or gender forms, the vernacular "Figure of exchange" more precisely figures the complex condition of the English rhetor. Given Puttenham's disavowal of the "Figure of exchange," it might seem that such masculine-feminine "brauenesse" has no place in English speaking. Indeed, somewhat uncharacteristically, Puttenham does not follow his definition with any explicit examples of enallage, having al- ready declared that English has no real use for the figure. Yet despite this seeming absence, an example of English enallage does in fact lurk within Puttenham's disclaimer. In describing the exchange of grammatical ac- cidents in the language of the Greeks and Romans, Puttenham writes, "they changed not the very word, but kept the word, and changed the shape of him onely." Puttenham's explanation for the transformation of this generic "word" substitutes the masculine third-person pronoun for the neuter, thus altering the grammatical gender of the word through the "Figure of exchange." Renaissance writing often interchanges "he" and "it," and thus this exchange might seem innocuous. However, its ap- pearance in a discussion of enallage suggests that although the infinite variety of Latin grammatical inflection remains largely inaccessible in the English language, the system of pronouns might provide a native re- source for altering the gender of English words.20 The evidence of other vernacular rhetorics bolsters this reading, for they likewise exemplify enallage in English through an exchange of pronouns. Richard Sherry's Treatise of Schemes and Tropes (1550) defines the figure as " casus pro casu, when one case is putte for another, as me thynke it is so."21 Sherry's sole example of enallage changes the first-person pronoun from the sub- jective to the objective case, from "I" to "me thynke it is so."22 Sherry does not imagine the possibility of an enallage of gender; however, the</page><page sequence="8">180 JENNY C.MANN first edition of Henry Peacham's Garden of Eloquence (1577) does so, explaining it as the substitution of pronouns: Enallage of gender, when we put the Neuter for the Masculine, or Femine, or any one of them for another, thus, he doth beare a countenance as it were an Emper- our. For, as if he were an Emperour, the Neuter for the Masculyne, it is a wicked daughter that dispyseth hir mother, bycause she is olde: For, she is a wicked daughter that dispiseth hyr mother, the Neuter for the Femine; the wynde is loude, she bloweth colde, the Femine for the Masculine.23 These three attempts to make enallage speak English suggest that ver- nacular rhetorics favor pronoun substitution as the method of making the "Figure of exchange" workable in the vernacular. Thus far, these English examples of enallage of case and gender do not seem to trouble the gendering of the actual subjects represented by these pronouns, unless one agrees with Henry Peacham that "wynde" must be definitively masculine. However, a subsequent English rhetoric indicates that shifts in grammatical gender might be used to express disorderly gender behavior on the part of actual subjects. John Smith's The Mystery ofRhetorick UnveiVd (1657) defines enallage as "a change of order," de- rived from " [enallos] inversus &amp; prœposterus , turn'd upside down and disorderly. A figure whereby the Number or Gender, Mood, Person, or Tense are changed, or put one for another."24 Smith begins with a number of Latin examples of enallage , taken from Ovid, Cicero, and Virgil, before listing "Scriptural Examples of Enallage." For enallage of gender, Smith provides the following passage: "Thus is Isa.3.12. Women shall bear rule over them, &amp;c. (i.e.') effeminate men shall, &amp;c. The feminine Gender put for the Masculine, effeminate men are called women."25 Smith's example is confusing in that it does not spell out the process of substitution tran- scribed in other guides - where the explanatory formulation commonly reads "this" for "that." His example of the "upside down and disorderly" figure first expresses a grave social disorder, whereby actual women rule over men, before the explanation reverses the process of figuration and transforms the threatening women into emasculated men: "women" here means not "women" but rather "effeminate men." Smith thus pre- sents enallage , a rhetorical structure concerned with grammatical gen- der, as a figure animated by early modern notions of appropriate gender behavior. Smith's designation of the figure as " prœposterus " further as- sociates the "Figure of exchange" with the sexual disorder of sodomy,</page><page sequence="9">The " Figure of Exchange" 181 for the "preposterous" delineates many varieties of social disorder in the early modern period, most especially those "unnatural" sexual practices that exchange back for front.26 Smith's explanation places the "Figure of exchange" within this network of sexual and social disorderliness, using the figure to describe, and implicitly condemn, effeminate men. So despite the lack of "braueness" in the vernacular language, a linguis- tic inaptitude which leads Puttenham to explicitly reject enallage and causes most other English rhetorics to omit the figure from their catalogs, these few English rhetorics do indeed discover ways to accommodate enallage to the vernacular tongue. They apply the figure to the system of pronouns, those parts of the English language that visibly manifest a difference of grammatical person, case, and gender. In this exchange of pronouns, the "Figure of exchange" then impacts not just the grammati- cal accidents of English words but also the gender of the English subjects to which those pronouns might refer. Thus the figure evokes the doubled social and sexual positions produced by English rhetorical practice, and it also allows John Smith's Mystery to imagine a preposterous figure who might take men for women. Within the guides, these exchanges are pri- marily caught up in the drive to increase English's standing as a language capable of art. However, the capacities of a figure of speech that allows words to change their case, to shift from masculine to feminine, might be construed as desirable in other ways. The erotic potential of this pro- cess of grammatical exchange, that is, the sexual desirability of a figure that has undergone a change of "case," constitutes the central conceit of Shakespeare's twentieth sonnet, a lyric that imagines a figure both "Mas- ter" and "Mistris." Shakespeare's Sonnet 20, or "The Exchange" A Womans face with natures owne hand painted, Haste thou the Master Mistris of my passion, A womans gentle hart but not acquainted With shifting change as is false womens fashion, An eye more bright then theirs, lesse false in rowling: Gilding the obiect where-vpon it gazeth, A man in hew all Hews in his controwling, Which steales mens eyes and womens soules amaseth. And for a woman wert thou first created, Till nature as she wrought thee fell a dotinge,</page><page sequence="10">182 JENNY C.MANN And by addition me of thee defeated, By adding one thing to my purpose nothing. But since she prickt thee out for womens pleasure, Mine be they loue and they loues vse their treasure. - Shakespeare, Sonnet 20 The M [ist] ris Masculine. -Handwritten marginal note to the same sonnet, titled "The Exchange," in an early annotated copy of John Benson's edition of Shakespeare's Poems (1640) In the literary criticism of Renaissance poetry, the sonnet bears a privi- leged relationship to rhetorical practice; like other courtly gestures, it can be understood as the witty product of ingenious figurative play. The constricted length of the sonnet form necessitates that every word and phrase bear a dense signification, and sonnet writers often use their po- ems to demonstrate their own rhetorical mastery and test the effects of a particular figure of speech. Shakespeare's Sonnet 20 operates in just this fashion, using an English version of enallage to describe the sexually composite beloved in a poem that one early modern editor titled "The Exchange" and another reader named "The M [ist] ris Masculine."27 By ac- knowledging these terms, we can see that a previously unidentified ver- nacular mode of figuration structures the poem. Despite the constraints of grammatical and natural gender systems that distinguish between "he" and "she," Sonnet 20 imagines a figure that might exchange the shape of female for male and then persist as something between the two. The lyric describes the transformation of its beloved according to the grammatical exchanges of enallage , and in so doing it produces a vernacular version of the classical figure, what the poem calls a "Master Mistris." We can catalog a number of iterations of the English enallage contained within the fourteen lines of the poem. According to its condensed narra- tive of exchange, the poet's beloved is first created female; however, nature subsequently changes her mind, transforming the newly formed woman into a man, presumably to better satisfy the demands of her "doting." Na- ture achieves this exchange of gender through the addition of "one thing," the male member, just as the grammatical exchanges of enallage occur through the addition or substitution of verbal "affects," or endings. The beloved's new ending marks the end or defeat of the poet's ability to "vse" his (her? its?) body for his own pleasure. Yet although the beloved has been "prickt" out "a man in hew" long before the composition of the poem,</page><page sequence="11">The " Figure of Exchange" 183 the speaker still designates him (her? it?) as a figure of composite gender: a "Master Mistris" with a woman's heart (sort of), a woman's face, and a man's complexion. This amalgamated figure throws both men and women (not to mention the anthropomorphic "nature") into a state of confused de- sire. The poem concludes by suggesting that both the poet and a horde of unnamed women can share the "treasure" of the "Master Mistris," although only the women will enjoy the "vse," or sexual "pleasure," of his (her? its?) body.28 Despite the seemingly composite gender of the beloved, not to mention the pansexual desire generated by the figure, the poem neverthe- less makes sharp distinction between the "fashion" of men and women, their habits as well as their physical form. Men have "pricks," while women have "nothing." Unlike the beloved, women's hearts engage in "shifting change"; their eyes are "rowling." The speaker twice describes this propen- sity toward change and alteration as a "false" condition of womanhood. As remarked earlier, a new title affixed to the sonnet in a subsequent edition of Shakespeare's poems, known as the Benson edition (1640), accounts for all of these modes of substitution, change, and alteration in one explana- tory phrase: "The Exchange."29 As this reading indicates, the formal properties of the "Figure of ex- change" produce the large structure of the sonnet, which focuses on the relationship of poet to beloved. Thus, by retitling what the 1609 Quarto marks simply as "20" as "The Exchange," the much-maligned Benson edi- tion precisely identifies the rhetorical logic of the poem.30 The "Figure of exchange" exists between two rhetorical practices; it is the product of the distance between Latin and English as well as a sign of the desire to close that distance. The beloved of Sonnet 20 embodies this very condi- tion of difference, distance, and desire, for the "Master Mistress" is nei- ther entirely male nor entirely female, and the figure furthermore attracts equal attention from men and women. This body caught between two forms incarnates the "Figure of exchange"; it also generates the frustrated desire that constitutes the Petrarchan formula of thwarted love. In other words, the exchanges of the figure constitute both the topos (subject) and the speaking voice (subjectivity) of the sonnet. In addition to providing both the plot of the lyric and the bodily compo- sition of its central object of desire, this rhetorical mode of exchange - a process which substitutes "he" for "she" - also accounts for the difficulty of affixing stable gender pronouns to the poet's beloved. This problem of indeterminate reference is not confined to Sonnet 20 but rather, as the</page><page sequence="12">184 JENNY C.MANN copious scholarship attests, has vexed editors and readers of the entire sequence since Benson first produced his now controversial edition.31 In- deed, one could describe much of the massive volume of criticism on the sonnets as a meditation on the problem of pronouns. The uncertain referent(s) of the sonnets' pronouns, most especially the various forms of the second-person pronoun (you/thee/thou), constitutes the crux of a centuries-old critical debate because it leaves in question the sonnets' direction of address. Despite Edmond Malone's confident division of the sequence into two gendered groups in his influential eighteenth-century edition - a division that largely persists in modern critical thinking - the vast majority of the sonnets do not specify the gender of the poet's be- loved "you."32 Unlike other sonnets in the sequence, Sonnet 20 specifies the gender of the addressee - in the second line it immediately identifies "thou" as "the Master Mistris" - but does so with a common, in-between gender that does not align with either male or female. The sonnet titled "The Exchange" identifies the Sonnets' shifting "yous" as "thou the Mas- ter Mistris of my passion," a beloved whose polymorphous "hews" sound like pronominal "yous"; it defines the beloved, in other words, by means of the English enallage .33 Because the lyric that Benson anthologizes under the title of "The Ex- change" has become a crux of the entire sequence, the locus classicus of the modern debate over the sexuality of the sonnets, the implications of this mode of figuration reverberate through discussions of the poems as a whole.34 Many of the most influential readings of the sonnets in the late twentieth century focus on Sonnet 20, readings that have rendered the long-denied homoeroticism of the sequence the new critical orthodoxy.35 However, as with everything else touching upon the composition, publi- cation, or signification of the sonnets, there exists no consensus as to the meaning of "The Exchange" or its relationship to the sex/gender system of early modern England (whether in 1609 or 1640). 36 The correlation be- tween this lyric and the "Figure of exchange" does not resolve this ambi- guity - indeed, by its very nature this rhetorical mode resists a teleology of desire that could be adduced as either hetero- or homosexual. Rather, it specifies the development of English rhetoric as one shaping force of this ambiguity and erotic excitement. Shakespeare's Sonnet 20 suggests that we might, in a meta-Puttenhamian gesture, rename the "Figure of exchange" the "Master Mistress," or per- haps "The M [ist] ris Masculine." Yet if we peruse the other sonnets in</page><page sequence="13">The " Figure of Exchange" 185 the sequence, another option emerges: we might avoid these compound nouns altogether and instead simply call the figure a boy. The gender play of pronouns authorized by the English enallage becomes dramatized in Ben Jonson's Epicene , in which the polymorphous title character is a boy, disguised as a girl, played by a boy. This particular bodily correlate to the English enallage- one that can become either he or she- moves us from the confined space of the lyric to the public space of the early modern theater, where boy actors also incarnate the desirability of the shifting, in-between "Figure of exchange." Jonson's Epicene , or The Silent Woman truewit: Take heed of such insectae hereafter . . . - Ben Jonson, Epicene Truewit's warning comes at the conclusion of Jonson's comedy, likely first performed in 1609, the same year that saw the publication of Shake- speare's sonnets.37 The allusion to insects is intended to insult two foppish knights who have lied about enjoying the sexual favors of the title charac- ter, Epicene , or The Silent Woman. These two knights are only second- ary characters; the play focuses on the misfortunes of a misanthropic, noise-hating citizen named Morose, who hopes to marry and produce a son so that he can disinherit his despised nephew Dauphine. At the beginning of the play it seems that Morose has found the perfect mate to achieve his plan: an extremely shy woman named Epicene, who almost never speaks aloud. After marrying the lady, however, Morose learns that he has been deceived as to her shyness, and the Lady Epicene quickly transforms herself into a loud and loquacious wife. Morose then tries to divorce his bride and, in a shocking twist at the end of the play, learns that Epicene is in fact no woman at all but a boy hired by Dauphine in or- der to preserve his inheritance and humiliate his uncle. Thus when True- wit, who is one of Dauphine's companions, insults the knights Sir John Daw and Amorous La Foole, the audience has already seen the "Mistress" Epicene metamorphosed into a boy. Here the two knights travel quite the opposite course, becoming effeminized by their exposure at the hands of Truewit and the other gallants. Truewit expresses their emasculation with a Latin figure of speech, calling the knights insects, but using the feminine form of the plural ending, insectae, rather than the masculine,</page><page sequence="14">186 JENNY C.MANN insecta. In other words, like John Smith's Mystery ; Truewit uses the fig- ure enallage to insult two effeminate men. This line- which feels almost like an afterthought, coming as it does after the astonishing revelation of Epicene's gender disguise - caps an entire theatrical production featur- ing bodies, relationships, and sentences constructed out of the shifting forms of the English enallage. Although I have begun with the end of the play, the action of Epicene manifests the gender effects of the "Figure of exchange" long before the revelation of Epicene's true gender and Truewit's concluding witticism. In- deed, the very title of the play aligns its disorderly content with the gram- matical accidents governed by the figure. "Epicene" is a term borrowed from Latin and Greek grammar: epicene nouns are words which, without changing their grammatical gender, may refer to either sex. The familiar instances of the epicene noun are pais in Greek and puer in Latin, both standard terms for "boy" but which can also mean "girl."38 The term de- notes what grammarians also refer to as the "common gender." "Epicene" thus names the condition of English grammar that prevents the translation of enallage into vernacular rhetoric. English nouns are nearly all de facto epicene terms, of a common gender that cannot be distinguished as either male or female. Thus, although the concept has no proper application in English grammar, the term "epicene" was often used in the early modern period as a synonym for "common."39 Jonson's English Grammar (1640) plays upon the sexually loose connotation of "common" when it defines epicene nouns as "the Promiscuous , ox Epicene, which understands both kindes: especially, when we cannot make the difference."40 It is impossible to "make the difference," that is, to distinguish the gender of an epicene term, because such words encompass "bothe kindes" of genders. By ti- tling the play and its central character Epicene - a figure who is pais , or puer, or boy and girl - Jonson teaches us to use the grammatical concept as a means of labeling the gender identity of persons who likewise seem to "understand both kindes."41 Such persons include, of course, boy actors. In constructing a plot around a cross-dressed boy who goes by the name "Mistress Epicene," Jonson's play takes as its avowed subject a central de- vice of the early modern theater; it also marks that device with a term of grammar. Epicene thus places the erotics of theatrical cross-dressing under the purview of the "Figure of exchange," which manipulates gram- matical accidents for rhetorical effect. Whereas a previous generation of feminist scholarship emphasized the misogyny of Epicene , most especially its discomfort with assertive women,</page><page sequence="15">The "Figure of Exchange" 187 these readings have lately given way to considerations of the erotic rela- tionships at work both in the play and between theatrical audiences and the boy acting companies who first staged Jonson's productions. The play begins by alluding to the sexual lability of prepubescent boys, opening with a scene in which Clerimont and his page joke about how the Ladies Collegiate enjoy dressing the boy as a girl and fondling him in the privacy of their bedchambers. Truewit then bursts upon this cozy domestic setting to complain about Clerimont's absence from town, disparaging his friend for being caught in an erotic triangle "between his mistress abroad and his ingle at home" (1.1.23-24). Clerimont's desire for both a woman and a boy places him somewhere "between" a series of sexual objects. The women in the play are caught there as well: Clerimont's boy complains that the Ladies Collegiate enjoy dressing him as a lady and playing with him uo' the bed" while showering him with kisses (1.1.12-17), and the women simultane- ously lust after Dauphine, a man fully grown. Although Truewit's descrip- tion of Clerimont's sexual pastimes indicates that a young gallant might alternately enjoy both women and boys, and the gentlewomen of town certainly attempt to seduce a variety of love objects, the play later suggests that one might also want to enjoy such diverse pleasures at the same time. Jack Daw composes a madrigal dedicated to Mistress Epicene that indicates the sexual desirability of mixed or hermaphroditic figures. The verses de- clare: "No noble virtue ever was alone, /But two in one" (2.3.28-29). Lest we miss this couplet's applicability to the sexual interests of the play, the other gallants persuade Daw to recite it a second time (2.3 34-35). This condition of being placed "between" a number of different desires was, for opponents of the theater, one of the most worrisome effects of the early modern stage. The evident desirability that boy actors held for their London audiences greatly disturbed Puritan critics of the English stage: such "ingles," or "catamites," generate an unfocused carnal desire that does not distinguish between women and boys.42 Antitheatrical polemic thus accused the theater of turning the English population into a multitude of sexually disordered Clerimonts. In addition to the title character herself/himself, nearly all the charac- ters in Epicene manifest some kind of gender disorder, often exhibiting the characteristics of both sexes.43 In the words of one critic, the play "jostles" with gender slippage and inversion, with characters who do not maintain what Jonson's English Grammar describes as the "differ- ence" between male and female.44 A brief catalog of the characters who manifest either sexual doubleness or some kind of behavioral gender</page><page sequence="16">188 JENNY C.MANN disorder suggests that, as in the case of the "Master Mistris," the "Figure of exchange" produces those who lie somewhere in between catego- ries. For example, we have the Ladies Collegiate, who live apart from their husbands and constitute "an order between courtiers and country madams" (1.1.74-75). The Collegiates are, by period standards of female behavior, extremely verbose, to say the least; they "cry down or up what they like or dislike in a brain or a fashion, with most masculine or rather hermaphroditical authority" (1.1.76-79). Not only do the Ladies assume a masculine prerogative, thus rendering them "hermaphroditical" figures, they also produce an institution that lies somewhere "between" the court and the country. One of their members, "Madame Centaure," even broadcasts this hybrid condition in her very name. As it happens, Ma- dame Centaure is not the only mixed beast in the play, for Dauphine also describes a character named Captain Otter as " animal amphibium re- ferring to a creature able to live both on land and in water (1.4.26). In its allusion to an animal of two natures, this reference also suggests Otter's sexual doubleness. Captain Otter is something less than a man, for while in the presence of Mistress Otter, he submits to female authority. As Mis- tress Otter reminds her sulky husband, he has agreed "that I would be princess and reign in mine own house, and you would be my subject and obey me" (3.1.31-32). Thanks to a favorable marriage contract, Mistress Otter, in the words of La Foole, "commands all at home," which leads Clerimont to afford her the title "Captain Otter" (1.4.29-30). In his humiliating submission to the rule of his wife, Captain Otter's domestic condition renders him just one of a series of male charac- ters emasculated by the events of the play. Like Mistress Otter, Mistress Epicene asserts her right to govern her new husband's household im- mediately following her marriage to Morose. Morose exclaims, "She is my regent already! I have married a Penthesilea, a Semiramis, sold my liberty to a distaff!" (3.4.53-54). Epicene proceeds to engage in what Truewit describes as a "masculine and loud commanding" (4.1.9-10), and as Epicene becomes more masculine in her governance (and more stereotypically feminine in her loquacity), Morose becomes less and less a man, eventually offering to geld himself if it would extricate him from the marriage (4.4.8-11). Finally, as already mentioned, Daw and La Foole are likewise effeminized by the tricks of Truewit and the other gallants, tricked into giving up their rapiers and becoming, in terms of their gender, truly "adulterate knights" (4.6.2). Clerimont insults Daw</page><page sequence="17">The "Figure of Exchange" 189 and La Foole under cover of praise, declaring that "you two govern the ladies; where'er you come, you carry the feminine gender afore you" (5.1.28-29). This compliment seems to congratulate the two would-be gallants for their power over women's affections, but it also implies that they behave like women. Truewit's final joke clarifies the meaning of this insult, when the two insect ae are indeed made to "carry the femi- nine gender." These various exchanges of gender and desire throughout the play come together in the marriage between Morose and Epicene, a marriage that comes to be understood through the language of "cases" as Morose attempts to free himself from his loquacious spouse. In act 5, scene 3, Truewit disguises the barber Cutbeard and the buffoon Captain Otter as a canon lawyer and divine, and he sends them to Morose in order to provide a sham consultation about "how many causes a man may have divortium legitimum , a lawful divorce" (5.3 70-71). Despite Morose's plea that they take "no excursions upon words," get "to the question briefly," and "avoid your impertinency of translation," Cutbeard and Ot- ter proceed to take up nearly two hundred lines of text in a dizzying discussion of the various justifications, or "cases," for divorce, playing on the multiple senses of "case" prevalent in the period (5 3 73-74, 82- 83). 45 As Cutbeard explains, "the canon law affords divorce but in few cases, and the principal is in the common case, the adulterous case" (5.3 76-77). This is later referred to as ' crimen adulterii: the known case" (5.3132). In other words, if a wife's "case" has become "common" or "known" (i.e., publicized, but also penetrated), a husband may dis- solve the marriage. Cutbeard and Otter go on to list twelve additional potential legal justifications for divorce, including error personae, "if you contract yourself to one person, thinking her another," and error qualitatis , "if she prove stubborn or headstrong, that you thought obedi- ent" (5.3 91-92, 96-97). At this Morose thinks he has discovered a solu- tion, only to be told that this is a lawful impediment " ante copulam , but not post copulam " (5.3.100). Throughout the scene Morose's hopes for divorce are repeatedly encouraged and then crushed, which provokes Truewit to gleefully comment, "Alas, sir, what a hope are we fall'n from, by this time!" (5.3.104). Just as Morose begins to despair, Cutbeard and Otter arrive at the twelfth and final case for divorce, which they describe at length in the following exchange (5.3.170-91):</page><page sequence="18">190 JENNY C.MANN cutbeard: The twelfth and last is si forte coire nequibis. otter: Ay, that is impedimentum gravissimum. It doth utterly annul and an- nihilate, that. If you have manifestam frigiditatem, you are well, sir. truewit: Why, there is comfort come at length, sir. Confess yourself but a man unable, and she will sue to be divorced first. otter: Ay, or if there be morbus perpetuus et insanabilis, as paralysis, el- ephantiasis, or so - dauphine: Oh, but frigiditas is the fairer way, gentlemen. otter: You say troth, sir, and as it is in the canon, master doctor. cútbeard: I conceive you, sir. cleri mont: [Aside] Before he speaks. otter: That "a boy or child under years is not fit for marriage because he can- not reddere debitum ." So your omnipotentes - truewit: [To Otter ] Your impotentes, you whoreson lobster. otter: Your impotentes , I should say, are minime apti ad contrahenda matrimonium. truewit: [To Otter] Matrimonium ? We shall have most unmatrimonial Latin with you: matrimonia , and be hanged. After surviving these hiccups in which Otter's bad Latin threatens to re- veal his disguise, Otter at last concludes that only through "frigiditatis causa " will Epicene have " libellum divortii " against Morose. Although the sham legal consultation began with a series of jokes about female pro- miscuity ( crimen adulterii : the known case), it culminates in a recom- mendation that Morose confess himself to be impotent so that Epicene herself will sue for divorce. This recommendation implies that because women have such a rapacious sexual appetite, they will never counte- nance being married to an impotent man. The payoff of the joke comes in the final scene of the play, when Morose publicly announces, as per the instructions of counsel, "I am no man, ladies" (5.4.43). This entire scene bristles with Latin errors and jokes, including the "Figure of exchange," for in addition to serving as both a legal term and a bawdy pun on women's libidinal parts, "cases" also provide the gram- matical content of the figure enallage. Although we do not yet know that the Lady Epicene is in fact a boy in disguise, Cutbeard and Otter's garbled Latin hints at this conclusion, particularly when Otter mistak- enly substitutes omnipotentes for impotentes in his discussion of im- potence's legal effects on the marriage contract. Truewit corrects him in an aside, hissing, "Your impotentes , you whoreson lobster" (5.3.187). Otter then revises his speech, telling Morose, "Your impotentes , I should say, are minime apti ad contrahenda matrimonium " (5.3.188-89). To which Truewit, exasperated with Otter's repeated errors, responds,</page><page sequence="19">The " Figure of Exchange" 191 " Matrimonium ? We shall have most unmatrimonial Latin with you: matrimonia , and be hanged" (5.3.190-91). Truewit fears that Otter's Latin mistakes will ruin his disguise: Otter's grammatical inflections are not properly "married" in that the plural form of contrahenda requires matrimonia , not -Mm.46 Likewise, as we will soon learn - and the the- atrical audience would have been as surprised as anyone else - Morose and Mistress Epicene are not actually married because Epicene lacks the appropriate "case." When Dauphine finally reveals Epicene to be a boy, he refers back to the divorce consultation, asking his humiliated uncle, "This is justum impedimentum, I hope, error personaeV (5.4.202-3). At this moment we learn that the shifting casus pro casu of the "Figure of exchange" has both married Morose to a boy and released him from the bond. Although the garbled Latinity of the divorce consultation renders it rather obscure to modern audiences, this debate about the status of Mo- rose's marriage and Dauphine's allusion to " error personae " in the revela- tion of his trick confirms the heretofore incipient connection between the events of the plot and the logic of the "Figure of exchange." The mis- placed grammatical accidents of Cutbeard and Otter's "unmatrimonial Latin" foreshadow the terms of Dauphine's soon-to-be-revealed trickery, which has caused Morose to wed himself to a boy in disguise. Although Dauphine has up to now seemed to be only a secondary character, es- pecially when compared to the extroverted Truewit, the finale reveals Dauphine to be the creator of the most astonishing trick contained in the play. As Truewit concedes, "Well, Dauphine, you have lurched your friends of the better half of the garland by concealing this part of the plot!" (5.4.220-22). In addition to one-upping his friends, Dauphine's mastery of the "Figure of exchange" also allows him to claim inheritance of Morose s estate by substituting a boy for a lady in his uncle's household. Dauphine describes his new inheritance as a "composition," a term that describes the play itself as well as the legal contract, and it is in service of both of these that the English enallage has been put to use (5.4.201). Dauphine thus uses the grammatical resources and promiscuous appeal of the Latin enallage to compose a proper English inheritance. Conclusion: Casus pro casu rosalind: What a case am I in then ... ? -Shakespeare, As You Like It (p. 207, 1. 82)</page><page sequence="20">192 JENNY C.MANN This essay has used the "Figure of exchange" to interpret two literary texts whose troubling of gender difference becomes legible through the manipulation of pronouns and grammatical accidents. My argument un- derstands the "promiscuous" bodies of Shakespeare's "Master Mistris" and Jonson's "Mistress Epicene" not with the conceptual tools of medi- cal theory or legal statute but according to the discourse of vernacular rhetoric. Neither Epicene nor the beloved of Sonnet 20 can be satisfacto- rily correlated to a bodily disposition derived from even the most elastic taxonomies of "natural" gender; their forms embody not an androgyne, eunuch, or hermaphrodite but rather the much more versatile "Figure of exchange," a figure whose pronouns generate bodies that remain unfixed, changeable, caught between kinds. These imaginative renderings of the English enallage are, by extension, haunted by the particular desires of vernacular rhetoric. English translations of enallage manifest the aspira- tion of vernacular rhetorics to narrow the distance between Latin and English linguistic practice, to discover vernacular forms for Latin figures, no matter how intractable. This mimetic desire produces an imperfect result: the "Figure of exchange," a rhetorical structure caught between two grammars. These works testify to the wide appeal of a figure who encompasses "both kindes," and I will conclude with another, even more exuberant dramatization of the figure's erotic force. The effects of the "Figure of exchange" are also manifest in another famously cross-dressed comedy: Shakespeare's 4s You Like It.47 In the beginning of this pastoral drama, the lady Rosalind flees political treachery at court and spends most of the play in hiding, disguised as the boy Ganymede. While in the guise of a boy, Ganymede woos Orlando on her own behalf, while also attracting the desiring attentions of a local shepherdess. The plot of the play con- cludes with a series of marriages, during which time Ganymede reveals herself to be a woman in disguise. Subsequent to the marriages and the conclusion of the dramatic action, Rosalind reemerges to address the au- dience in the form of an epilogue, the text of which testifies to the desir- ability of the composite body of Rosalind/Ganymede to a theater full of men and women. Rosalind begins by noting that "It is not the fashion to see the Ladie the Epilogue," famously going on to exclaim, What a case am I in then, that am neither a good Epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalfe of a good play? I am not furnish'd like a Begger, therefore</page><page sequence="21">The "Figure of Exchange" 193 to begge will not become mee. My way is to coniure you (O women) for the loue you beare to men, to like as much of this Play, as please you: And I charge you (O men) for the loue you beare to women (as I perceiue by your simpring, none of you hates them) that betweene you, and the women, the play may please. If I were a Woman, I would kisse as many of you as had beards that pleas'd me, com- plexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defi'de not: And I am sure, as many as haue good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind offer, when I make curt'sie, bid me farewell. (207, 11. 76-96, italics added) Rosalind's epilogue both conjures the audience and defines the play in the terms of the English enallage. Although Rosalind first announces herself as "the Ladie," she goes on to break the dramatic frame of the play and remind the audience that she is not in fact "a Woman" but a boy in costume. Rosalind laments this problem of nonidentity - a woman who is not a woman, a woman who should not be an epilogue - by exclaiming, "What a case am I in then?" The boy actor thus describes this ambigu- ous situation simultaneously in grammatical and anatomical terms. Both Rosalind's form and the play are happily situated "betweene" men and women, pleasing to all. This epilogue preserves multiple erotic futures, allowing the audience to imagine a "kisse" from the figure of their desire, whatever that figure may be.48 In fact, the effects of the "Figure of exchange" are manifest within the play just before Rosalind's saucy epilogue appears, in a passage far less familiar: the liturgy of the wedding ceremony. The ceremony reveals Ganymede to be the lady Rosalind, heir to the exiled duke, and weds the former boy to Orlando. In the First Folio printing of the play, when the goddess Hymen performs the marriage rites, she declares, Good Duke receiue thy daughter, Hymen from Heauen brought her, Yea brought her hether. That thou might ioyne his hand with his , Whose heart within his bosome is. (p. 205, 11. 88-92, italics added) The particulars of this scene have been rendered invisible to readers and audiences because all modern editions of the play replace "his hand" with "her hand," ascribing the double "his" to a compositor's error.49 But without this modern emendation, what we read in the Folio edition is the script of a marriage between a boy and a girl-disguised-as-a-boy (who is</page><page sequence="22">194 JENNY C.MANN also played by a boy actor) enacted through the grammatical exchanges of the English enallage. Over the course of Hymen's verses the "Figure of exchange" describes Rosalind with first the feminine and then the mas- culine pronoun, eventually joining boy to boy in the final lines of the cer- emony. These lines preserve the bride as both Rosalind and Ganymede, she and he, or "her" and "his," allowing the "unmatrimonial" grammar of the English enallage to be embodied once again on the early modern stage. Notes I would like to thank Will West, Jeffrey Masten, Wendy Wall, Karen Mann, Annika Mann, and Guy Ortolano for their comments on an earlier version of this essay. The first and third epigraphs are quoted from William Shakespeare, The Norton Shake- speare, ed. Stephen Greenblatt, Walter Cohen, Jean E. Howard, and Katharine Eisaman Maus (New York: Norton, 1997). Except where noted otherwise, references for Shake- spearean plays are to act, scene, and line number of this edition ( Merry Wives of Windsor hereafter cited as M WW). The second epigraph is quoted from a definition of the figure parenthesis in George Puttenham, The Arte of English Poesie (Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1970), 180. 1. In inflected languages, "case" is "one of the varied forms of a substantive, adjective, or pronoun, which express the varied relations in which it may stand to some other word in the sentence, e.g. as subject or object of a verb, attribute to another noun, object of a preposition, etc." ( Oxford English Dictionary , 2nd ed., s.v. "case"). It is marked through the addition of "endings" to words, and in a related sense, the term "case" also signifies the outer or exterior part of an object or person. 2.

For another close reading of Mistress Quickly and vernacular usage, see Eliza- beth Pittenger, "Dispatch Quickly: The Mechanical Reproduction of Pages," Shakespeare Quarterly 42, no. 2 (Winter 1991): 389-408. 3. In Shakespeare's A ntony and Cleopatra, Enobarbus puns on "case" and "cut" while consoling Antony over his wife Fulvia's death, explaining, "When it pleaseth the deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented" (1.2.147-52). 4. In a treatment of English-language dictionaries produced in the seventeenth century, Juliet Fleming reveals how women are used within such texts to represent the lexical extravagance of nonstandard English, an extravagance that demands regulation through proper vernacular instruction. Feminine ignorance serves precisely this function in this passage from Puttenham's Arte ; it justifies the explanation of what should be the plainest of "schoole points."

Madhavi Menon, Wanton Words: Rhetoric and Sexuality in English Renais- sance Drama (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004). 6. These works range in seriousness and content from translations of Aristotle and Cicero, to letter-writing manuals, to collections of orations, to dictionaries of tropes and figures of speech (the most common iteration); however, they all work to make some of the tools of rhetoric available in the English tongue. For a list of rhetorical manuals published in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, see Gerald P. Mohrmann, "Oratori- cal Delivery and Other Problems in Current Scholarship on English Renaissance Rhetoric," in Renaissance Eloquence , ed. James J. Murphy, 68-83 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: Univer- sity of California Press, 1983). 7. This definition of metaphor is taken from Abraham Fraunce, The Arcadian Rhetor- ike (London: Thomas Orwin, 1588), Bv-B2. 8. Also called accidence, inflection is a change in the form of a word so as to express the different grammatical relations into which it may enter, including distinctions of tense, person, gender, number, mood, and case. Although early modern English does have some noun inflection (as in the noun plural or past tense), since it is not as broadly inflected as Latin or Old English, it is classified as a noninflected language. 9. According to William Lily and John Coleťs A Shorte Introduction of Grammar (1549) - the standard textbook of the period - Latin grammar has seven genders: mascu- line, feminine, neuter, commune of two, commune of three, the doubtful, and the epicene. By comparison, most English nouns signify only a "common" gender - male, female, and neuter - and only in third-person singular pronouns does the vernacular language register grammatical gender (Pittenger, "Dispatch Quickly," 404). 10. Patricia Parker, Shakespeare from the Margins: Language , Culture , Context. (Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 141-42. As Elizabeth Pittenger explains, Lily and Coleťs Grammar arranges grammatical genders in a hierarchy that cannot be rationalized according to grammatical principles: "the masculine gendre [síc] is more worthy than the feminine, and the feminine more worthy than the neutre [s/c] " (Pittenger, "Dispatch Quickly," 404). 11.

Puttenham likens the lexical and syntactical manipulations of figurative language to the fashion of gentlewomen, explaining that "as we see in these great Madames of honour ... if they want their courtly habillements or at leastwise such other apparel as custome and ciuilities haue ordained to couer their naked bodies, would be hälfe ashamed or greatly out of countenaunce to be seen in that sort, and perchance do then thinke themselues more amiable in euery mans eye, when they be in their richest attire, suppose of silkes or tyssewes and costly embroideries, then when they go in cloth or in any other plaine and simple apparel. Euen so cannot our vulgar Poesie shew it selfe either gallant or gorgeous, if any lymme be left naked and bare and not clad in his kindly clothes and coulours" ( Arte of English Poesie, 149-50). In this passage poesy is masculine - "bis kindly clothes" - while rhetorical ornament is associated with female costume. 15.

In using the phrase "rhetorical logic" to describe the motivated relationship between the poem's beloved and the structure of the "Figure of exchange," I cite the influential work of Joel Fineman, who argues that certain rhetorical modes produce large thematic motifs in Shakespeare's poetry.

Benson reordered the sequence, conflated the 146 sonnets of the 1609 Quarto into seventy-two poems, gave many of the poems titles, and introduced textual variants (Rob- erts, Reading Shakespeare's Poems, 158). Throughout its more recent literary history, the Benson edition has been condemned, as James Schiffer puts it, "as a piratical desecration" ("Reading New Life into Shakespeare's Sonnets: A Survey of Criticism," in Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays, ed. James Schiffer, 17 [London: Garland, 2000]). Yet Benson has</page><page sequence="25">The "Figure of Exchange" 197 been recently defended, most prominently by Arthur Marotti and Margreta de Grazia, and his edition is perhaps no longer quite as infamous as it once was. 32. Margreta de Grazia notes that an "astonishing" number of sonnets do not make the gender of the addressee explicit: about five-sixths of the first 126 sonnets leave the gender of the beloved unspecified ("The Scandal of Shakespeare's Sonnets," in Schiffer, Shake- speare's Sonnets. 33. Stephen Booth and Joel Fineman both note the homophonic nature of "hews" and "yous," although Fineman is considerably more persuaded by the potential pun than Booth is. See Booth, Shakespeare's Sonnets , 164; Fineman, Shakespeare's Perjured Eye, 213. 34. Fineman, Shakespeare's Perjured Eye, 272. 35.

For example, Valerie Traub notes that although Sonnet 20 does conflate masculin- ity and femininity into one beloved object ("Master Mistres"), it then reasserts gender difference by elevating the status of the male friend through a series of comparisons to women.

Indeed, as Steve Brown argues, the connection between the common gender in grammar and bodily hermaphroditism becomes enfolded into the term "epicene" follow- ing the production of Jonson's play. Subsequent to its appearance in Epicene, or The Silent Woman, "epicene" came to signify a person who partakes of the characteristics of both sexes, an androgynous or hermaphroditic figure in either form or behavior, especially an effeminate man. Jonson himself uses the term to signify sodomitic sexual activity when he excoriates the "tribade lust" and "epicene fury" of the female subject of his "Epigram on the Court Pucelle" (277, 1.7-8). 42. Both terms denote a boy kept for homosexual use. See Brown, "Boyhood of Shake- speare's Heroines"; Mario DiGangi, "Asses and Wits: The Homoerotics of Mastery in Satiric Comedy," English Literary Renaissance 25, no. 2 (1995): 179-208, 255. 43. In The Broken Compass, E. B. Partridge lists the "epicene" properties of virtually every character in the play (New York: Columbia University Press, 1958). Such a list has become conventional in analyses of Epicene, including my own. 44.

Patricia Parker treats these associations at length in Literary Fat Ladies , especially 106-7. 46. Dutton points this out in an editor's note to 5.3. 190-91. One further exchange be- tween La Foole and Captain Otter uses the figure enallage. La Foole suggests that Captain Otter must not bring his drinking mugs to his wife's party because "she says they are no decorum among ladies." Otter replies, "But they are decora , and that's better, sir" (3.4.121- 22). By "no decorum " La Foole means that Mistress Otter does not think the drinking mugs appropriate for ladies' company; however, Otter responds by substituting the grammati- cally correct plural ending - decora - in order to insist that they are both beautiful and appropriate. 47.

Although, as Mario De Gangi emphasizes, in the Epilogue these futures are all explic- itly heteroerotic ("Queering the Shakespearean Family," Shakespeare Quarterly 47, no. 3 [Autumn 1996]: 269-90, at 286). 49. Jeffrey Masten first drew my attention to the Folio version of this scene. On the neg- ligence of an editorial tradition that is incapable of reading "his hand" as anything other than a compositor's error, see Jeffrey Masten, "Textual Deviance: Ganymede's Hand in^4s You Like It," in Field Work: Sites in Literary and Cultural Studies, ed. Marjorie Garber, Paul B. Franklin, and Rebecca L. Walkowitz (New York: Routledge, 1996), 153-63.</page></plain_text>
