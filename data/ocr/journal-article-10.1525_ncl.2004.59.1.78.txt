SHAPPLE oouth African rock art captured the imagination of many Victorians, from geologists like George William Stow to the celebrated author Olive Schreiner. In The Native Races of South Africa (1905) Stow wrote: the ancient Bushmen themselves have recorded [their occupa- tion of the land] upon the rocks, in their paintings, their sculp- tures or chippings, and stone implements, which are as much their unquestionable title-deeds as those more formal documents so valued among landowners in more civilized portions of the earth.1 Painted or chiseled upon the rocks that form an integral part of the regional landscape, these images testified to the inti- mate connection between the land and the creative produc- tions of South Africa’s earliest known native inhabitants: the Nineteenth-Century Literature, Vol. 59, No. 1, pp. 78–114.

While Gerald Monsman has considered the rock paintings and Waldo’s wood carvings as “imbedded self-references” to the novel, Cherry Clayton has discussed these visual works as comparable productions of “primitive artist[s].”3 Other critics, such as Joseph Bristow (who acknowledges Waldo’s apparently primitive affinity with his South African environment) and Loren Anthony, have identified the rock paintings as the sign of a repressed precolonial history.4 Interpretations of the cru- cial role that these paintings play in the novel, therefore, have largely corresponded both with Schreiner’s degree of empathy (no matter how conflicted) toward the San and with her grow- ing anticolonial sentiments. As Laura Chrisman has argued in regard to the author’s 1890s fiction, Schreiner’s critique of British imperial capitalism exposes the exploitation of land and 2 The names “Bushmen” and “San” are both controversial. Paul S. Landau argues that the term “bushman” served as a derogatory collective marker denoting a “margin- alised” and “impoverished” group composed of “largely unrelated pastoralist, forager, and bandit peoples” (Landau, “With Camera and Gun in Southern Africa: Inventing the Image of Bushmen, c.1880 to 1935,” in Miscast: Negotiating the Presence of the  Bushmen, ed. Pippa Skotnes [Cape Town: Univ. of Cape Town Press, 1996], p. 141). Robert J. Gordon argues, however, that some present-day descendants prefer the name Bushmen to San, as it testifies more effectively to the history of the peoples it labels (The Bushman Myth: The Making of a Namibian Underclass [Boulder, Co.: Westview Press, 1992], pp. 6 –7). Throughout my discussion I use the term “Bushmen” when discussing Schreiner’s fictional representations and “San” when referring to the historical peoples accredited with having produced rock art. 3 See Monsman, Olive Schreiner’s Fiction: Landscape and Power (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers Univ.

In this essay I explore how The Story of an African Farm reflects the ambivalent position of a second-generation colonist hoping to become postcolonial. Viewed from this perspective, Waldo emerges within the narrative’s aesthetic and ethnological dis- courses as a model home-grown artist whose grotesque wood carvings represent a form of primitive resistance to European capitalism, in what has come to be considered the first South African novel. The connections established between the works of San painters and colonial artists thus ultimately displace one kind of indigenous art with another, once the San have, osten- sibly, disappeared. “Now the Boers have shot them all,” Waldo eulogizes (p. 16), while he alone remains to interpret their “grotesque” paintings (p. 10), to produce aesthetically kin- dred forms of “grotesque” art (p. 123), and to commune with the land in which he has grown. Unless the contemporaneous incarceration of many San in Cape Town’s Breakwater Prison could be considered a form of premature burial, however, the novel’s fetishistic eulogy ultimately proves to be premature, yet imaginatively and politically expedient. This novel of origins at once aesthetic, cultural, and his- torical rests on an imaginative act of displacement that coin- cides with a demographic one. Schreiner’s representation of Bushman culture in the novel, informed by late-nineteenth- century ethnographic constructions of cultural authenticity, re- moves the image of the true Bushmen to another time, while also detracting from the contemporary experiences of indige- nous forced laborers. The Bushmen who live with and work for the European characters, whether a Cape Town wagon leader or a Dutch landowner’s servant, apparently fall outside the cat- egory of authentic Bushman culture—at least to the extent 5 Laura Chrisman, Rereading the Imperial Romance: British Imperialism and South African Resistance in Haggard, Schreiner, and Plaatje (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2000), esp. pp. 120–42. </page> <page sequence="4"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 81 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 81 that they often elude the literary critic’s purview. Native South Africans maintaining social and cultural traditions in oppo- sition to colonial rule do not appear among the characters in The Story of an African Farm, although the date of the novel’s set- ting coincides with a historical period of intense border strug- gles, the removal of indigenous peoples, and a growing interest in salvaging traces of the reportedly disappearing, traditional small-scale societies of South Africa. In the absence of these  societies, Waldo, a young South African of European descent, appears as their cultural and historic successor. As a kind of colonial indigene, Waldo has a rather paradoxical relationship to his native precursors: the Bushmen appear absent yet haunt- ingly present, as authentic artists immortalized in their rock paintings as well as inauthentic workers or prisoners within Eu- ropean society. The Bushmen, therefore, stand in relation to Waldo as both his historic predecessors and his political rivals. Sigmund Freud’s theory of fetishism, the primary founda- tions of which lie in medical research of the 1880s, offers a model for deciphering the colonial indigene’s curious relation- ship to his predecessors.6 Moreover, like Schreiner’s portrayal of this paradoxical figure, nineteenth-century theories of the fetish by authors from Karl Marx to Alfred Binet draw on a body of knowledge associated with ethnological constructs of primitive culture. To recount a familiar theoretical paradigm, Freud posits fetishism as a strategy of displacement that negoti- ates a contradiction emerging in the face of two incompatible perceptions of reality.7 The fetish, onto which the fetishist dis- places a denial of difference, both memorializes and protects against the threat to self that the recognition of difference ef- fects. Through the fetish, therefore, difference may be simulta- neously acknowledged and disavowed—a strategy that Freud, perhaps alluding to the fetish’s etymological link to artifice, 6 See Robert A. Nye, “The Medical Origins of Sexual Fetishism,” in Fetishism as Cul- tural Discourse, ed. Emily Apter and William Pietz (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1993), pp. 13–30. 7 See Freud, “Fetishism” (1927), trans. Joan Riviere, in The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, ed.

Referring to his study of two men who each failed to cognize the death of his father without exhibiting signs of a psychosis, Freud explains how one of these patients later developed a neurosis and “oscillated in every situation in life between two assumptions: the one, that his father was still alive and was hindering his activities; the other, opposite one, that he was entitled to regard himself as his father’s successor” (“Fetishism,” p. 156). The neurosis ulti- mately brought to light the “divided attitude” of the fetishist, whose negotiations allow “wish” and “reality” to exist concur- rently (p. 156). This contradictory historical relationship to a paternal figure thus enacts a disavowal of the father’s death, of his actual physical absence. The fictional case introduced by Waldo, while resembling this case history of a troubled paternal relationship, involves the denial of the Bushmen’s contemporary physical existence. To resolve the troubling paradox that the appearance of contem- porary Bushmen with a different account of South African his- tory would introduce, Schreiner removes these more resistant Bushmen from the novel’s fictional present and instead inserts them into its representation of the historical past. This act of dis- placement in narrative time accompanies a displacement of value: the authentic Bushmen’s lingering presence is both ac- knowledged and disavowed in the “old Bushman-Paintings” (African Farm, p. 10). The colonial indigene must confront the alterity of another, more original, indigenous South African so- ciety, one whose acknowledgment threatens the colonist’s iden- tity as primary keeper of the land. The attributed antiquity of the paintings is documented in the novel by the condition of the surrounding rock and the non-anthropomorphic and distinctly 8 Sigmund Freud, “Splitting of the Ego in the Process of Defence” (1938), trans.

This attributed antiquity ultimately protected the colonist from confronting the Bushmen’s claims to the land in the narrative’s present, while artfully serving as a memorial to the Bushmen’s ostensible ab- sence. The grotesque, which recent critics discuss as a represen- tational strategy for embodying contradiction and ambivalence, ultimately serves not only as the novel’s aesthetic of indigenous art but also, I will suggest, as its sign of late imperial fetishism. Schreiner’s vision of the colonial indigene emerges with her critique of European colonial rule in Africa. In accord with its opening epigraph by Alexis de Tocqueville, proposing that “the entire man is . . . to be found in the cradle of the child” (p. xlii), The Story of an African Farm, as Ruth First and Ann Scott note, criticizes colonialism by examining the in- stitution’s effects on the lives of three colonial children who ul- timately serve as its “symbol and expression.” 9 Em, the English 9 Ruth First and Ann Scott, Olive Schreiner (New York: Schocken Books, 1980), p. 97. </page> <page sequence="7"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 84 84 nineteenth-century literature stepdaughter of the Dutch farmowner Tant’ Sannie, assumes the role of lawful heir to the homestead as well as pious Chris- tian matron. Em’s rebellious orphan cousin Lyndall serves as the dominant female protagonist, whom Elaine Showalter re- gards as “the first wholly serious feminist heroine in the English novel.”10 Lyndall, like her companion Waldo, possesses no le- gal claim to the land that she inhabits, and she spends her childhood at the mercy of her Dutch benefactress. As Loren Anthony explains, the anomalous status of these characters as “landless whites” parallels Schreiner’s own position at the time of the novel’s composition (“Buried Narratives,” p. 9). Waldo, son of the German overseer Otto, appears an awkward and “uncouth creature with small learning” throughout much of the novel (African Farm, p. 268); his readings of his natural sur- roundings, however, provide the dominant fictional perspec- tive within the novel through which to view and attempt to un- derstand the South African landscape. Waldo’s right to the land, while officially denied, emerges through his formation within this land and his ability to interpret its natural-historical significance. It is therefore appropriate that Lyndall compares Waldo to a thorn-tree (p. 198), an indigenous plant whose roots delve into the red soil of the predominantly arid Karoo. Whereas critics have frequently discussed The Story of an African Farm as a feminist novel centered on the struggles of Lyndall, the novel’s male protagonist has received less seri- ous attention.11 Since the novel’s first publication, Lyndall has elicited more interest from readers than the other characters have. In an 1884 letter to Henry Norman, Schreiner reflects on Lyndall’s apparent ability to overshadow her male counterpart: “I was glad especially that you felt interested in Waldo, because few people care for him so much as for Lyndall, and I am fond 10 Showalter, A Literature of Their Own: British Women Novelists from Brontë to Lessing (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1977), p. 199. 11 Doris Lessing offers a particularly prominent exception by calling Waldo both “the heart of the book” and “the first appearance in women’s writing of the true hero, in a form appropriate to the novel; here a kind of Caliban who mysteriously embodies Prospero’s spirit, or Faust’s” (“Afterword to The Story of an African Farm, by Olive Schreiner” (1968), in Doris Lessing,A Small Personal Voice: Essays, Reviews, Interviews, ed. Paul Schlucter [New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1974], pp. 105, 108). </page> <page sequence="8"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 85 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 85 of him.”12 As she reveals in an 1892 letter to her publisher  T. Fisher Unwin, Schreiner took her character Waldo seriously and hoped that his story would speak to working-class male readers: “I insisted on An African Farm being published at  1/- because the book was published by me for working men. I wanted to feel sure boys like Waldo could buy a copy, and feel they were not alone. I have again . . . allowed it to be printed at 3/6 as I felt sure most poor lads would have it within reach.” 13 As the first edition of a single-volume novel generally cost nearly twice as much, Schreiner often struggled with her pub- lishers to ensure that the work would reach its intended audi- ence. Moreover, the pseudonym under which Schreiner ini- tially published the novel, Ralph Iron, strengthens the novel’s connection to the iron-rich South African soil and the iron stones of the kopje, while also soliciting a kind of kinship with the readers who worked to extract such natural resources from the earth.14 Claims made by the European colonists on the South African landscape nevertheless encounter staunch resistance in Schreiner’s anticolonial novel. J. M. Coetzee observes that the colonial homestead on which the novel’s plot unravels appears strikingly out of place: “Whereas in the peasant model the farm is naturalized by being integrated with the land, and in turn historicizes the land by making the land a page on which the generations write their story, Schreiner’s farm is an unnat- ural and arbitrary imposition on a doggedly ahistorical land- scape.”15 Schreiner, he furthers, conveys “the alienness of Eu- ropean culture in Africa” and the “unnaturalness” of life on the farm represented, thus diverging from the pastoral tradition in 12 Schreiner, letter to Henry Norman, 22 May 1884, in Olive Schreiner Letters, Vol- ume 1: 1871–1899, ed.

While the farm and the majority of its inhabitants seem strange intruders upon an inhospitable land, however, Waldo manages to make himself at home by communing with the land in which he has grown up. The Teutonic name Waldo, after all, means “ruler.” Waldo’s “grotesque” wood carvings and keen observations of nature, exemplified in his ability to see the world in the leaves of an ice-plant (African Farm, p. 267), establish him as  an artist who possesses a symbolic rather than legal right to the land. Among the variety of nineteenth-century thinkers em- bodied in Waldo’s character, Ralph Waldo Emerson plays a par- ticularly prominent role; the name “Waldo,” in fact, forms part of Schreiner’s tribute to the famous essayist who died the year before the novel’s publication.16 Waldo’s interpretations of his natural environment throughout the novel reveal an ability to envision a harmonious whole from its diverse parts. The eye that Waldo turns to nature thus makes him an artist, as embod- ied in Emerson’s figure of the poet, in which “the eye is the best of artists”: The charming landscape which I saw this morning, is indubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the landscape. There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet. This is the best part of these men’s farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title.17 16 As Showalter observes, the novel’s author (Ralph), its protagonist (Waldo), and its secondary character (Em) together form Schreiner’s anagrammatic tribute to Emerson (see A Literature of Their Own, p. 199). As Schreiner’s husband noted, Olive Schreiner recited lines from Emerson’s Essays “up to the day of her death” (S. C.  Cronwright-Schreiner, The Life of Olive Schreiner [Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., [n.d.]], p. 98). Following Emerson’s London Lectures of 1847, the American essayist’s works circulated widely among British readers and appealed to several generations of Victorian Skeptics. Schreiner’s mother, Rebecca, who was also the novelist’s earliest in- tellectual supporter, read his essays in Healdtown, South Africa, in the 1860s; Olive Schreiner read his essays in earnest a decade later (see Karel Schoeman,Olive Schreiner: A Woman in South Africa, 1855–1881 [ Johannesburg: Jonathan Ball, 1991], p. 144). 17 Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Nature” (1836), in his Essays and Lectures, ed. Joel Porte (New York: Literary Classics of the United States, 1983), pp. 9, 14. </page> <page sequence="10"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 87 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 87 Waldo takes “the cream” from the African farm while leaving its owner Tant’ Sannie with “skimmed milk” and bultongs, or, strips of dried meat. Waldo, like Emerson’s poet, serves as an in- terpreter and “lover of nature,” who “in the presence of na- ture” frequently experiences “a wild delight . . . in spite of real sorrows,” and thus possesses a particular claim to the surround- ing landscape (“Nature,” p. 10). As Emerson does not consider in his essay the rights of Native Americans to the land that the poet “integrates” and that the farmers have claimed as private property, however, Waldo’s connection to the landscape ap- pears equally as untroubled now that the Bushmen seem to have disappeared. Schreiner’s remembrance of Emerson, ad- vocate of a kind of postcolonial American cultural identity sep- arate from that of England and Europe, thus highlights the double vision maintained by colonists becoming, or hoping to become, postcolonial.18 Although the landscape in Schreiner’s novel may remain, as Coetzee suggests, “doggedly ahistorical” (“Farm Novel,” p. 4), its record of natural history provides Waldo with the pri- mary source through which the novel authorizes his position in time and space. While ahistorical in its apparent indifference to the rise and fall of ancient and contemporary empires, the landscape reveals to Waldo an alternative to the secular and re- ligious historical narratives available to him through the books within his reach: “‘If they could talk, if they could tell us now!’ he said, moving his hand out over the surrounding objects—‘then we would know something. This “kopje,” if it could tell us how it came here!’” (African Farm, p. 15). Moving his hand across the rocks as across a page of text, Waldo takes a particular in- terest in the origin of the solitary kopje that disrupts the sur- face of the plain and that the narrator describes as “a heap of round iron-stones piled one upon another, as over some giant’s grave” (p. 1). Waldo echoes this mythic explanation of the kopje when admitting how as a child he “thought a great giant 18 In her later essay “The South African Nation” (1900) Schreiner compares the earlier movement toward independence in the United States with what seemed to her the inevitable development of South Africa as an independent nation.

Fisher Unwin, 1923), pp. 367–83. </page> <page sequence="11"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 88 88 nineteenth-century literature was buried under it” (p. 15). Loren Anthony asserts that the buried giant represents “the repression of the sign of History” (“Buried Narratives,” p. 5), and he draws further support from Stephen Clingman’s observation that “a colonial culture must needs repress the real history of violent aggrandizement that underlies its claim to the colonized land as of natural right.”19 I would further argue that Waldo’s recognition and disavowal of this trace of a South African Titan reflects his troubled relation to the San, whose paintings survive on the iron stones of the kopje. While Waldo acknowledges the San as his South African predecessors, his position as an indigenous colonial artist as well as the sole interpreter of the rock paintings works to efface the San’s lingering presence and to subject their histories to his own narratives. The more mature Waldo rejects the mythic giant yet con- tinues to contemplate the creative mystery of the kopje in the chapter “Plans and Bushman-paintings,” which emphasizes the significance of natural historical narratives. The specific year invoked in this chapter, 1862, appropriately coincides with the publication of sociologist Herbert Spencer’s First Principles, which famously attempted to reconcile Christian doctrine with evolutionary natural sciences.20 As critics have frequently noted, First Principles, which Waldo reads later in the novel, was crucial to Schreiner’s own thought. In her famous 1884 letter to Havelock Ellis, Schreiner recounted: “He [Willie Bertram] lent me Spencer’s First Principles. I always think that when Christianity burst on the dark Roman world it was what that book was to me. I was in such complete blank atheism.”21 Shat- tering foundational beliefs that Schreiner garnered from a mis- sionary childhood, Spencer’s work opened up a space in her thought that she would eventually fill with an interest in evolu- tionary science and natural philosophy. “Plans and Bushman- 19 Clingman, “Revolution and Reality: South African Fiction in the 1980s,” in Rendering Things Visible: Essays on South African Literary Culture, ed.

Waldo’s inter- est in the natural sciences, particularly in the wake of Charles Lyell’s 1830 Principles of Geology (which challenged the timeline of religious histories), represents a secular approach to con- structing history and the temporal relations between people, things, and events therein. Waldo’s earliest historical view, in fact, resembles a cross section of the surrounding landscape, one in which the layers of sedimentation visually represent the succession of years at  a glance. This condensed vision of a secular, universal history, in which Waldo envisions a “stream of people” moving “in one direction,” offers a synchronic glimpse of the succession of  geographically located human eras from “the old Greeks and Romans” to the contemporary peoples of China and India (African Farm, pp. 3–4). Waldo’s glance thus corresponds with what anthropologist Johannes Fabian terms “the visual reduc- tion of temporal sequence,” or an emerging “‘synchronic’ un- derstanding” of time employed for the purpose of constructing universal histories that provided the foundation for early an- thropological constructions of primitive culture.22 As Waldo  listens to the incessant ticking of his father’s hunting watch, which, in the age of popular statistics suggests that “every time it ticked a man died!” (African Farm, p. 3), he envisions this  forward march of standardized, periodized time.23 As Fabian notes, the emergence of modernity, and thus of anthropologi- cal discourse, “must be sought, not in the invention of a linear conception, but in a succession of attempts to secularize Judeo- Christian Time by generalizing and universalizing it” (Time and the Other, p. 2). In Waldo’s vision, though, the perceived in- 22 See Fabian, Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object (New York: Co- lumbia Univ. Press, 1983), p. 4. 23 On the representation of progressive time, see especially Patricia Murphy, “Timely Interruptions: Unsettling Gender through Temporality in The Story of an African Farm,” Style, 32 (1998), 80–101; and Anne McClintock, Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Contest (New York and London: Routledge, 1995). </page> <page sequence="13"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 90 90 nineteenth-century literature evitability of time’s progression overlays the supposedly natural decline of nations; the idea that India and China were suppos- edly, by the mid nineteenth century, “going over” testifies to their status within the contemporary British imaginary as de- generate cultures. Waldo’s historical vision, by emerging from the land, thus forges his apparently primitive ties to his sur- rounding natural environment, while also informing his more modern scientific mastery over it. This dual vision of the colo- nial indigene is precisely what renders his claims to the land so subversive and so seductive. Waldo applies a similar view to his reading of the kopje, its paintings, and their painters, as he constructs a natural history from the visible traces that remain as part of the geological record. As in the universal history that he envisions, distant moments in time lie side by side under his panoramic gaze. As a boy he tells Lyndall: “Sometimes . . . I lie [on the hill] with my sheep, and it seems that the stones are really speaking—speak- ing of the old things, of the time when the strange fishes and animals lived that are turned into stone now, and the lakes were here; and then of the time when the little Bushmen lived here. . . . It was one of them, one of these old wild Bushmen, that painted those [pictures]” (pp. 15–16). While the stones seem to speak to him, the ancestors of the indigenous peoples whom he mentions do not. The Bushmen painters whom Waldo evokes assume a position within this condensed and pe- riodized chronology sometime after “the time” of “strange fishes and animals” and before the colonial present and its sheep. Classed among the ranks of “the old things,” the cre- ators of these paintings undergo a kind of fossilization and are relegated to a remote past.24Waldo thereby accredits the stones 24 Waldo’s reading of the geological record as a type of historical template, more- over, corresponds with Schreiner’s later comparison between geological and social stratification in South Africa: “We are not a collection of small, and, though closely contiguous, yet distinct peoples; we are a more or less homogeneous blend of hetero- geneous social particles in different stages of development and of cohesion with one another, underlying and overlaying each other like the varying strata of confused geo- logical formations” (Olive Schreiner, “South Africa: Its Natural Features, Its Diverse Peoples, Its Political Status: The Problem” (1891), inThoughts on South Africa, p. 51). In Schreiner’s analogy, however, the Bushmen, with their “primitive domestic institu- tions,” and “the nineteenth-century Englishman fresh from Oxford, with the latest views on social and political development,” coexist with one another yet remain at a </page> <page sequence="14"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 91 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 91 of the kopje with narrating their own story, while he also pro- jects his own narrative agency onto the scene. Schreiner thereby naturalizes the historical narrative that she attributes in The Story of an African Farm to the landscape and Waldo’s place therein. Allegedly listening to the story  of the kopje (one that would presumably correspond with a  geological sense of time), Waldo envisions his place in what  Coetzee identifies as “inhuman time” (“Farm Novel,” p. 2), or in what Fabian would call “naturalized Time” (Time and the Other, p. 15)—i.e., time that endures even without the pres- ence of human consciousness or agency: “Now the Boers have shot them all, so that we never see a little yellow face peeping out among the stones. . . . And the wild bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone soon, and only the stones will lie on here, looking at everything like they look now. I know that it is I who am thinking, . . . but it seems as though it were they who are talking” (African Farm, p. 16).25 Viewing this chronology from an abstracted distance, Waldo both imagines a time that preceded human existence and fore- sees one that will follow human extinction; the stones, like the science of geology, have relativized human existence by placing it in a non-anthropomorphic temporal framework. Applying Fabian’s terms, we can see that, unlike nineteenth-century so- cial evolutionists who attempted to reconstruct “stages leading to civilization,” Schreiner’s protagonist seems to adopt a natu- ralized conception of time that accepts “the stark meaningless- ness of mere physical duration” while “order[ing] an essentially discontinuous and fragmentary geological and paleontological record” (Time and the Other, pp. 15, 14). Waldo’s selective and condensed vision of this natural his- torical narrative, however, as well as his placement of himself immediately after the Bushmen and wild bucks, seems some- what less than natural. Schreiner accords Waldo a privileged place within this narrative, succeeding indigenous South Afri- distance in “different stages of development” (p. 51). According to Schreiner, “In South Africa the nineteenth century is brought face to face with a prehistoric world” (p. 64). To borrow Fabian’s terms, the English and the San of Schreiner’s analogy coex- ist in “Physical Time” yet are placed at a distance in “Typological Time.” 25 This passage closely resembles Schreiner’s account of the Karoo in her 1891 es- say “South Africa” (see Thoughts on South Africa, p. 41). </page> <page sequence="15"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 92 92 nineteenth-century literature cans and occupying the central moment of creative presence within the novel—a moment from which the San, denied ac- cess to what Fabian would term “shared Time” (Time and the Other, p. 34), have been omitted. In order to occupy “shared Time,” to enter into a coeval exchange, argues Fabian, the peo- ples under scrutiny may be distanced neither in “Physical Time” (as Waldo does by locating the Bushmen in a different natural historical era) nor in “Typological Time” (which Waldo accomplishes by referring to the Bushmen’s hunter-gatherer practices).26 While Waldo acknowledges the Bushmen as his South African predecessors, his present position as artist and sole interpreter of the rock paintings works to efface the Bush- men’s lingering presence and subject their histories to his own narratives. From his position as an ostensibly initiated reader of the landscape and its historical significance, Waldo constructs a narrative about the Bushmen and their paintings, still visible on the surface of the kopje’s rocks. While relaying more strictly ethnographic details concerning the location and materials of the paintings, Waldo also attempts to understand the unknown painter as well as the possibility of alternate criteria of aesthetic judgment: “He [the original painter] did not know why, but he wanted to make something, so he made these. He worked hard, very hard, to find the juice to make the paint; and then he found this place where the rocks hang over, and he painted them. To us they are only strange things, that make us laugh; but to him they were very beautiful. . . . “He used to kneel here naked, painting, painting, painting; and he wondered at the things he made himself.” (African Farm, p. 16) While Waldo identifies artistic activity in another (“to him they were very beautiful”) he nevertheless holds this Other and his 26 Whereas “Physical Time” serves as a “parameter of cultural process” and lends it- self to the measurement of movement along a linear, temporal scale (as in evolutionary reconstruction), “Typological Time” is perceived more as a static “quality of states” (“preliterate vs. literate,” for example) or as the distance between these states (see Fabian, Time and the Other, p. 24). </page> <page sequence="16"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 93 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 93 aesthetic at a distance (“to us they are only strange”).27Waldo’s characterization of the San paintings as strange and laughable finds reinforcement through the narrative voice, which re- fers to the paintings as “grotesque” and implicitly subjects them to aesthetic and ethnographic judgment. Found frequently among the repertoire of terms in contemporary ethnological constructions of primitive art, denoting its divergence from Eu- ropean standards of realist verisimilitude, the “grotesque” also gained renewed popularity as an aesthetic category, most fa- mously theorized in Victorian England by John Ruskin in The Stones of Venice (1851–1853).28 Ruskin describes the grotesque as wild and monstrous, rude and savage, yet indicative of a “deep insight into na- ture.”29 The grotesque, he explains, lacks the “softness” and skillfully wrought forms of the beautiful; unlike the sublime, it lacks nobility and the consistency that leads to a sense of “wholeness” (Stones of Venice, XI, 171, 181). Instead the gro- tesque denotes an aesthetic of fragmentation and incongruous juxtapositions. Ruskin, however, attributes to the grotesque a social value that corresponds with the rise of the British work- ing class and the nostalgia for an idealized form of non- exploitative labor. While these forms may appear imperfect, he argues, they testify to the unalienated working conditions of their creators, to the freedom allowed them to employ their imagination and diverge from “thoughtless” copying and the mechanistic perfection of surfaces.30 Imperfection, according to Ruskin, thus serves as “the sign of life in a mortal body” and 27 Schreiner’s later discussion of San rock paintings in her essay “The Problem of Slavery” notably differs from the more empathetic view that Waldo here exhibits (see Schreiner, “The Problem of Slavery,” in Thoughts on South Africa, pp. 106–47). 28 Schreiner’s list of readings prior to completing The Story of an African Farm in- cluded the works of John Ruskin. See Joyce Avrech Berkman, The Healing Imagination of Olive Schreiner: Beyond South African Colonialism (Amherst: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 1989), p. 20. 29 John Ruskin, The Stones of Venice, in The Works of John Ruskin, Library Edition, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn, 32 vols. (London: George Allen, 1904), XI, 169. Further references are from this edition and appear in the text. 30 Ruskin’s discussion of alienation corresponds with his critique of capitalism, the division of labor, and the hierarchy of classes within the labor force: “It is not, truly speaking, the labour that is divided; but the men:—Divided into mere segments of men” (Stones of Venice, X, 196). </page> <page sequence="17"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 94 94 nineteenth-century literature evidence “of a state of progress and change” (Stones of Venice, X, 203). He consequently urges his readers to “demand no refine- ment of execution where there is no thought, for that is slaves’ work, unredeemed” (X, 199). While Ruskin himself may have preferred to classify South African rock art with the art of  India and the “Pacific islands,” which he labels “the barbarous grotesque of mere savageness” (Stones of Venice, XI, 189), Schreiner’s representation of the paintings exhibits the neces- sary criteria of Ruskin’s “noble grotesque.” These paintings conjure the image of a painter relatively free and imaginative, endowed with insight and appreciative of beauty. The term “grotesque” also enters into the narrator’s de- scription of Waldo’s wood carving and thus forges an aesthetic link between Waldo’s work and the Bushmen’s paintings. As Waldo is a disenfranchised laborer on the South African farm, his identification with the grotesque suggests that he, like the idealized Bushmen painters, may represent a form of primitive resistance to the capitalism of European colonialism. Indeed, his refusal to sell his “grotesque” wood carving to a European traveler shows his degree of aversion toward the expanding commodity sphere of capitalism. As South African rock art pos- sessed an obviously intimate connection to the natural land- scape, and usually lacked the portability necessary to enter into European markets, this work represented a kind of noncapital- ist art par excellence.31 As a self-taught artist living at what the imperial metropole considered the border of European civilization, Waldo works  in the style of indigenous South African art and exhibits a “deep insight into nature.” While Waldo may have adopted these forms from the indigenous South African artworks among which he has grown up, he may not simply be employ- ing a borrowed style; instead, these native forms may have be- come his own. Schreiner’s own ethnological beliefs about the effects of climate and geography on the individual suggest such a reading: 31 A few of the larger European ethnological museums in the nineteenth century, however, held examples of rock paintings. </page> <page sequence="18"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 95 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 95 Were two infants removed from each other at birth, the one to be brought up in Finland and the other in India, the mere climatic and physical differences would, at the end of forty years, have rendered them highly dissimilar both in physical constitutions and in many intellectual and material wants, while their descen- dants at the end of six generations would certainly represent dis- tinct human varieties, for which distinct laws and institutions would be requisite. (“The South African Nation,” p. 376) Born of his South African environment, although in many ways still defined by the institution of the colonial farm and its Euro- pean heritage, Waldo appears to develop “intellectual and ma- terial wants” that distinguish him from his fellow Europeans and exhibit his ostensibly more authentic ties to the land. This aesthetic connection, however, forges a politically tenuous rela- tionship between the colonial creator and his colonized prede- cessors, between a privileged presence and a prematurely buried past. A glimpse of this past, and of San contact with Eu- ropeans, nevertheless appears in now-famous rock images such as this commando scene (see Figure 2). While Waldo himself may not survive the end of the narrative, Schreiner’s novel serves as an “enduring monument” to the colonial indigene and an emerging South African literary tradition.32 Leaving stories of “wild adventure,” “ravening lions,” “hair-breadth escapes,” and “cattle driven into inaccessible ‘kranzes’ by Bushmen” to imaginative metro- politan writers “in Piccadilly or in the Strand,” Schreiner claims to root the novel, like her character Waldo, in her native South African soil.33 In her preface to the second edition she explains 32 Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek, “A Brief Account of Bushman Folk-lore and Other Texts; Second Report Concerning Bushman Researches, Presented to Both Houses of the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, by Command of His Excellency the Governor” (Cape Town: J.

Sadly he must squeeze the colour from his brush, and dip it into the grey pigments around him. He must paint what lies before him” (p. xl). The South African writer, Schreiner explains, must daily encounter the unmediated facts of colo- nial life, and romance proves an unsuitable form for their con- tainment. One of the facts that Schreiner observes, for exam- ple, includes the widespread massacre of indigenous peoples, </page> <page sequence="20"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 97 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 97 rather than the constant threat of unruly native bandits. While the facts that she assembles may lead her narrative away from the romance, the organization of this material within the nar- rative does not entirely conform to the dominant nineteenth- century conventions of the realist novel, and thus it necessi- tates the genre’s revision. Schreiner’s observation of the facts before her, like those confronting her observing protagonist, informs her fragmented and discontinuous fictional narrative. The grotesque thus aptly characterizes Schreiner’s novel, and theories of the grotesque help to illuminate the narrative’s experimental style. Dissatisfied with the genres available to her, Schreiner incorporates formal characteristics from both the  realist novel and the romance; dreams, letters, allegories, and parodic sermons additionally comprise her extremely hetero- geneous style, which often self-consciously exposes the differ- ent genres’ various rhetorical strategies in a proto-modernist fashion. This kind of heterogeneity and contradiction most fre- quently characterizes the grotesque as theorized by Ruskin. The influential mid-twentieth-century critic Wolfgang Kayser similarly attributes to the grotesque both “the fusion of realms which we know to be separated” and “the suspension of the  category of objects.”34 More recently, Geoffrey Galt Harpham has maintained that the grotesque “refuses to be taken in whole because it embodies a confusion of type.”35 Failing to  fall into a single category of classification, the grotesque, ac- cording to Harpham, is a kind of “non-thing” that closely re- sembles what poet and scholar Susan Stewart has termed the ambivalent and the anomalous.36 Harpham employs the “use- ful distinctions” that Stewart makes between the terms anom- alous, ambiguous, and ambivalent, which Stewart clarifies in her own study: “The anomalous stands between the categories of an existing classification system. . . . The ambiguous is that which cannot be defined in terms of any given category. . . . The ambivalent is that which belongs to more than one domain 34 Kayser, The Grotesque in Art and Literature, trans. Ulrich Weisstein (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1963), p. 185. 35 Harpham, On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature (Prince- ton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1982), p. 6. 36 SeeOn the Grotesque, p. 4. </page> <page sequence="21"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 98 98 nineteenth-century literature at a time.” 37 Harpham maintains that this confusion—this strategy of deformation—serves as an interval of “emergent comprehension” that ultimately leads to a kind of reformation, and to “new inventions.”38 Locating the grotesque in the moment preceding such dis- coveries, during which old paradigms prove insufficient and new ones have not yet taken their place, Harpham offers us a conceptual framework for discussing Schreiner’s aesthetic. He draws an analogy with radical “scientific discoveries,” such as Darwin’s theory of evolution, as particularly prominent mo- ments at which new paradigms and explanations emerge: “This pregnant moment is a ‘paradigm crisis,’ when enough anom- alies have emerged to discredit an old explanatory paradigm or model, and to make it impossible to continue adhering to it, but before the general acceptance of a new paradigm. The par- adigm crisis is the interval of the grotesque writ large” (On the Grotesque, p. 17).39 The Story of an African Farm exhibits such a “paradigm cri- sis” on several levels: generic, epistemic, aesthetic, and politi- cal. Schreiner’s generic experimentation leads her work away from the nineteenth-century realist novel yet does not exactly gain it admittance to the ranks of modernism or even natural- ism. The epistemic shift from religious to secular stories of ori- gins and narratives of history, which the sciences of geology and, later, of evolutionary biology strongly affected, manifests itself within the novel, particularly through Waldo’s own crisis and eventual conversion. An aesthetic shift appears in Schrein- er’s attention to the so-called primitive arts, at a time when the Gothic style had achieved renewed popularity, despite the on- going Victorian interest in Classicism, and when sub-Saharan art was only slowly beginning to gain recognition among Euro- peans. The Story of an African Farm also anticipates, or attempts 37 Susan Stewart, Nonsense: Aspects of Intertextuality in Folklore and Literature (Balti- more: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1979), p. 61. Harpham quotes these definitions in On the Grotesque, p. 4. 38 See Harpham, On the Grotesque, pp. 15, 17. Similarly, Kayser associates the grotesque with historical periods in which “the belief of the preceding ages in a perfect and protective natural order ceased to exist” (Grotesque in Art and Literature, p. 188). 39 Harpham draws on the work of T. S. Kuhn, specifically The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1962). </page> <page sequence="22"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 99 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 99 to envision, a shift in political structure from colonial to post- colonial South Africa. Schreiner’s struggle to revise the genre of the novel, I would argue, involves finding a suitable form to represent these new historic and artistic paradigms. While Schreiner in The Story of an African Farm aligns the grotesque with indigenous South African art, this aesthetic also signals the novel’s relation to its broader social and political context. Schreiner’s employment of the grotesque offers her an al- ternative to the conventional realist novel. Her description of the dominant approach to literary realism, particularly its con- struction of characters and events, corresponds somewhat to a social evolutionary narrative that attempts to construct the illu- sion of a seamless causality in which arbitrary, discontinuous, and incidental “facts” find no place. She refers to this literary approach in her preface as “the stage method,” in which “each character is duly marshalled at first, and ticketed” and will surely return at the appropriate moment to “act his part”; this story closes with the fall of a curtain, the taking of bows, and a satisfying sense of “completeness” (p. xxxix). The work of Charles Dickens offers an illuminating paral- lel to Schreiner’s novel, which she wrote while reading Dombey and Son (1847–48). Raymond Williams attributes to Dickens the realization of “a new kind of novel” that could effectively represent increasingly arbitrary and complex urban social rela- tions.40 In his novels, Williams suggests, men and women pass each other without recognition, sometimes colliding, “but then as the action develops, unknown and unacknowledged rela- tionships, profound and decisive connections,” originally ob- scured, begin to emerge: “These are the real and inevitable re- lationships and connections,” suggests Williams, “the necessary recognitions and avowals of any human society” (English Novel, p. 33). While sharing with Dickens this approach to character and plot development, Schreiner avoids such closure at the end ofThe Story of an African Farm, and her characters do not all connect in a world of necessary avowals. Schreiner, I would ar- gue, struggled to realize “a new kind of novel” that would rep- 40 See Williams, The English Novel: From Dickens to Lawrence (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1970), pp. 31–32. </page> <page sequence="23"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 100 100 nineteenth-century literature resent and critique the intrusion of a European capitalist econ- omy and social order in a predominately rural South Africa. Instead of employing the “stage method,” Schreiner turns to what she calls in her preface “the method of the life we  all lead” (African Farm, p. xxxix). In this approach, notions of Providence and even historical determinism give way to contin- gency and fragmentation: “Here nothing can be prophesied. There is a strange coming and going of feet. Men appear, act and re-act upon each other, and pass away. When the crisis comes the man who would fit it does not return. When the cur- tain falls no one is ready” (p. xxxix). The sum of the work’s characters and events thus do not construct a reassuring whole. Schreiner’s method, in this respect, corresponds with Ruskin’s characterization of the grotesque as a “narrowed and broken” vision (Stones of Venice, XI, 181), as an aesthetic of fragmenta- tion in which partial glimpses of a presupposed whole resist a totalizing vision held together by the logic of causality or in- evitability. In The Story of an African Farm Schreiner stages the abrupt appearance and disappearance of quantitatively mar- ginal characters, but she does not—and cannot—resolve the conflict of major protagonists like Lyndall, and she avoids the construction of psychological depth in most of her characters, many of whom remain exaggerated caricatures like Tant’ San- nie and one of her suitors, Bonaparte Blenkins.41 Several of the more grotesque moments in The Story of an African Farm attempt to escape the psychology of the characters entirely, or at least to shift the reader’s attention to a parallel yet non-anthropomorphic perspective, such as that of Waldo’s dog. This non-anthropomorphism corresponds with the reve- lation of Waldo’s natural historical vision as well as with the iconography of the rock paintings; these moments in the nar- rative ascribe to the reader an uncannily nonhuman position from which to view the human characters, and they remind the reader of Waldo’s suspicion that even the stones are watching him. Such a shift in perspective lures the reader outside of the 41 While caricatures have been associated with the grotesque at least since the eigh- teenth century, Kayser additionally lists “the loss of identity” or “destruction of person- ality” and “emotional perspective” among its characteristics (Grotesque in Art and Litera- ture, pp. 185, 186). </page> <page sequence="24"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 101 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 101 rational, psychologized characters’ realm of deliberate action and reaction, of planning and enacting their futures, and of reflecting upon and ordering their memories of the past. While such a shift of perspective may stem from Schreiner’s Spencer- ian belief in “a unity underlying all nature,” 42 it also corresponds with what R. D. Haynes identifies as Schreiner’s Romanticism: specifically, her consistent use of symbolism and allegory (liter- ally, “other talk”).43 After Bonaparte has destroyed Waldo’s prized sheep-shearing machine, the perspective shifts to Doss the dog, who “watched [Bonaparte’s] retreat with cynical satis- faction” while observing his master “on the ground with his head on his arms in the sand” (African Farm, p. 74). Entering a more allegorical register, the narrative leaves its protagonist facedown in the sand, in order to recount the dog’s distracted play and slow torture of a nearby beetle. The fate of both the beetle and Waldo meet in the final sentences of the chapter, concluding with “a striving, and a striving, and an ending in nothing” (p. 74). The grotesque, suggests Kayser, embodies this type of “estranged world” in which accepted values are dis- located and “the categories which apply to our world view be- come inapplicable” (The Grotesque in Art and Literature, pp. 184, 185). By depicting the moment immediately following the ma- chine’s destruction from Doss’s perspective, the narrative for- goes the emotional devastation of Waldo’s loss (for which the reader has been prepared) in order to focus on the senseless cruelty of the dog’s disinterested play. Schreiner frames her seemingly contingent and fragmen- tary fictional world of characters and events within a hetero- geneous and stylized narrative, which serves to highlight the grotesque novel’s use and frequent mistrust of language. The mistrust of words, in fact, emerges explicitly several times throughoutThe Story of an African Farm, which largely favors ob- 42 See Schreiner, letter to Havelock Ellis, 8 April 1884, in Letters, Volume 1, p. 37. 43 See R. D. Haynes, “Elements of Romanticism inThe Story of an African Farm,” Eng- lish Literature in Transition, 1880–1920, 24 (1981), 64. Incidentally, it is probably no coincidence that all of Ruskin’s literary examples of the grotesque are also allegories. On African Farm as allegory, see Irene E. Gorak, “Olive Schreiner’s Colonial Allegory: The Story of an African Farm,” Ariel, 23, no. 4 (1992), 53–72; and McClintock, Imperial Leather. </page> <page sequence="25"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 102 102 nineteenth-century literature servation as the more reliable source of knowledge. A debate between the perceptive Lyndall and the benevolent yet vulner- able overseer Otto arises over the reliability of Bonaparte’s sto- ries. Lyndall’s mistrust of Bonaparte’s words strikes at the very foundation of what Otto believes to know; spoken or written, the word serves as Otto’s “irrefragable evidence” (African Farm, p. 22). When Lyndall questions the validity of Bonaparte’s nar- ratives, Otto reveals his religious adoration of the word: “How do you know that anything is true? Because you are told so. If we begin to question everything—proof, proof, proof, what will we have to believe left? How do you know the angel opened the prison door for Peter, except that Peter said so? How do you know that God talked to Moses, except that Moses wrote it?” (p. 28). Otto reacts against the declining capacity for belief in the word amid the growing demand for verifiable, observ- able evidence. Bonaparte, a physiognomically suspect and ill- dressed figure who has recently arrived on the farm by foot, constructs an elaborate story of his allegedly noble lineage, his tragic loss of material assets at sea, and the recent death of his horse. While Otto’s critique of positivism may in many ways  be justified, his implicit trust in the man who could repeat his story three times without variation prevents him from recogniz- ing the visible, external signs of Bonaparte’s treachery. Through careful observation, however, Lyndall identifies Bonaparte’s deception; while Otto believes Bonaparte’s claim that he is a nobleman whose horse died the day before he approached the farm on foot, Lyndall reads Bonaparte’s lies on the soles—or lack thereof—of his dilapidated shoes. Otto fails to interpret the significance of his surrounding circumstances, despite his ability to discern and foretell the events of the romance he reads. Otto easily identifies in the written work the deception of its antagonist, as he exclaims: “Ah, I thought so!—That was a rogue!—I saw it before!— I knew it from the beginning!” (p. 61). It is ironic that Otto cannot foresee the roguery of Bonaparte, who ultimately de- ceives Tant’ Sannie and turns her against her loyal and hard- working overseer. Thus, reading conventional romances does not prepare the reader for the types of lessons that Schreiner incorporates in her novel. As a production necessarily com- </page> <page sequence="26"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 103 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 103 prised of words, The Story of an African Farm responds to the medium’s potential duplicity by foregrounding rhetorical forms in order to expose their signifying power and their potential abuse. The sermon delivered by Bonaparte, convincing for its stylistic and syntactical borrowings as well as for its speaker’s bodily performance of spiritual sensibility, thus impresses its lis- teners who either do not recognize its perversion of Christian doctrine or do not at all comprehend English. Surrendering oneself to the formal presentation of the utterance and its “in- scrutable charm” (p. 39), without recognizing what lies behind it, results in dangerous and potentially deadly misreadings. Schreiner’s novel of ideas thus serves as a novel of readerly ed- ucation in which we are called upon to recognize and interpret a variety of rhetorical strategies and genres and to perceive their uses and abuses. The grotesque provides The Story of an African Farm with a form that reflects Schreiner’s ambivalence toward preexisting paradigms and the language that she necessarily employs, while also locating her novel within a South African context. Rhetor- ical structures and individual words have also grown inade- quate, and, before finding new models to take their place, Schreiner exposes their insufficiency through an often ironic process of deformation. This aesthetic links Schreiner’s novel to Waldo’s wood carvings as well as to the Bushman paintings, estranged from their native interpreters because “the Boers have shot them all.” The novel thus announces and enacts its ostensibly indigenous authority to provide both an interpreta- tion of the paintings and an account of the painters. The symbolic claim to the land in Schrein- er’s novel, however, seems troubling if we consider that claim’s historical context. Whereas the Boers did not shoot all of the San by 1862 (the year represented in the “Plans and Bushman- paintings” chapter) nor by 1883 (the year of the novel’s publi- cation), the infiltration of Dutch and British colonists—and their sheep—into the northern Cape as far as the Orange River dispossessed surviving San of both land and subsistence. </page> <page sequence="27"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 104 104 nineteenth-century literature F igure 3 . San representation of an encounter with a European, copied by T. A. Dowson. Courtesy of the Rock Art Research Institute, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. A variety of rock paintings offer San perspectives on recurring conflicts with Europeans (see, for example, Figure 3). Accord- ing to Janette Deacon, the introduction of merino sheep (which Tant’ Sannie owns [see Africa Farm, p. 80]) raised the colonists’ stakes in taking over territory lying between the Or- ange and Sak Rivers in the northern Cape—territory that “was known as Bushmanland.”44 The British Crown displaced the land’s previous residents, the /Xam San and the Korana, in 1847, after deeming the largely unfertile region suitable for grazing. “After the introduction of merino sheep to the Karoo,” Deacon explains, “the colonists put pressure on Britain to an- nexe the land and stop cross-border conflict” (“The /Xam In- formants,” p. 14). This disruption of San lifestyle, and of their relation to the land and its water sources, resulted in desperate raids on European livestock, consequent incarceration and forced labor, and also employment by local farmers. Louis  Anthing, Resident Magistrate and former Civil Commissioner of Namaqualand, recommended to the Colonial Secretary of Cape Town in a report dated 1 April 1862 that “the Bushmen be given land of their own, as well as sheep and goats” in com- 44 Janette Deacon, “The /Xam Informants,” in Voices from the Past: /Xam Bushmen and the Bleek and Lloyd Collection, ed.

Following the Korana War of 1868 to 1869, in which the British Northern Border Police prevailed against Korana and San resistance, a government notice dated 13 May 1869 proposed a solution to this problem of landless- ness by announcing the inscription as servants of “destitute women and children [and occasionally men] who [were] con- tinually coming into Camp to beg for food.”45 Applications for servants were received from all over the Cape, while imprison- ment continued to provide an option for containing further acts of resistance. The German philologist Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek, who accepted the position of official translator to the Governor of the Cape, Sir George Grey, in 1856, conducted the first of his famous series of interviews with San speakers  at the Cape Town Gaol as early as 1857. Bleek first met with /Xam San speakers when Anthing brought several men to Cape Town in 1863, whereas the /Xam San whom Bleek began to interview extensively in 1870 were survivors of the Korana War and had been imprisoned in the Breakwater Prison. Bleek’s interest in gathering and recording San narratives increased with the publication in the July 1874 issue of the Cape Monthly Magazine of Maluti San folklore and chromolithograph copies of rock paintings from present-day Lesotho.46 Joseph Millerd Orpen, the surveyor, later parliamentarian, and husband of Olive Schreiner’s cousin Élise-Pauline Rolland (Schreiner lived with them as a governess in 1870), had collected this folklore and copied these paintings while traveling through the eastern Cape with his Maluti guide, Qing. In response to this publi- cation, Bleek emphasizes the importance of analyzing San lit- erature and beliefs in relation to their paintings: “It gives at once to Bushman art a higher character, and teaches us to look upon its products not as the mere daubing of figures for idle pastime, but as an attempt, however imperfect, at a truly artistic conception of the ideas which most deeply moved the Bush- 45 Quoted in Janette Deacon, “Archaeology of the Flat and Grass Bushmen,” in Voices from the Past, p. 250. 46 See Joseph Millerd Orpen, “A Glimpse into the Mythology of the Maluti Bush- men,” Cape Monthly Magazine, n.s. 9 (1874), 1–10. </page> <page sequence="29"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 106 106 nineteenth-century literature man mind, and filled it with religious feelings.” 47 In his time Bleek was one of the few researchers who turned from the con- cern for primarily archaeological remains (“a few ‘sticks and stones, skulls and bones’”) to “that which is most characteristic of their humanity, and, therefore, most valuable,—their mind, their thoughts, and their ideas” (“A Brief Account,” p. 2). Bleek thus attempted to turn from the remains of a San past to those of their present. Respecting the “humanity” of the San, if not always the severity of their families’ precarious social and eco- nomic positions, Bleek and his sister-in-law Lucy Lloyd were noted for treating their informants—//Kabbo, /A!kunta, / Han kass’o, and Dia!kwain, to name a few—as mutual collab- orators in a project that culminated in the 1911 publication Specimens of Bushman Folklore, a parallel text edition in /Xam San and English.48 Bleek’s interest in San languages and arts, however, also reflects the aspirations of his anthropological colleagues in preserving traces of an ostensibly primitive culture in an at- tempt to reconstruct a hypothetical human prehistory. In his 1875 report to the Cape Town Parliament, Bleek adopts the emerging discipline’s discourse of authenticity in his appeal for the small percentage of colonial revenue needed to continue collecting what he considered “pictures of the native mind in its national originality” before “the mental life of the Aborig- ines in its uninfluenced primitiveness” would become “effaced” (“A Brief Account,” pp. 2, 3). While this manner of argument may have proved the most politically expedient in presenting Bleek’s case before Parliament, its conservative aspirations and rhetoric of indigenous cultural effacement resonate with those of contemporary salvage ethnographers, and it privileges “tra- ditional” San beliefs over current ideas and concerns.49 It is 47 Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek, “Remarks on Orpen’s Mythology of the  Maluti Bushmen,” Cape Monthly Magazine, n.s. 9 (1874), 13. 48 See W.H.I. Bleek and L. C. Lloyd, Specimens of Bushman Folklore (London: George Allen and Co., 1911). 49 Bleek’s reference to the “national originality” of native minds resembles the ter- minology employed by his contemporary Adolf Bastian, who at this time actively pro- moted the collection of original artifacts allegedly embodying Völkergedanken (folk or ethnic thoughts) to preserve a cultural record of rapidly “disappearing” peoples and their cultures. Unlike Bastian, Bleek argues for the importance of an oral history over the exclusively material record that many of his contemporaries advocated. </page> <page sequence="30"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 107 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 107 significant that Bleek proposes the erection of “an enduring monument” to “the Aborigines” for a colonial posterity and in- tellectual history without proposing a plan for the immediate relief of the dispossessed peoples he grew to know and respect (“A Brief Account,” pp. 2, 3). Bleek’s series of interviews, like other acts of collecting, may have exacted a heavy price: Martin Hall notes that the tragic deaths of several informants and their family members indirectly resulted from their journeys to or from the Bleek residence in Mowbray.50 While most nineteenth-century research similarly favored traces of past San traditions, Bleek and Orpen’s application of South African folklore, beliefs, and historical narratives to the interpretation of rock paintings nevertheless differed from other contemporary approaches that, like Waldo’s, relied more heavily on observation while neglecting indigenous perspec- tives. Many such reports referred to the rock images as mark- ings or primitive writing denoting the presence of a nearby  water hole, or as meaningless ornament unimaginatively scrib- bled on the walls according to convention or to while away the time. Those who recognized San images as a fine art of compa- rable merit to that of Europe devoted considerable attention to acknowledging particularly “admirable attempts” at employing European conventions of drawing, including the use of shad- ing, perspective, and foreshortening. Reports of the 1870s and 1880s by George W. Stow and Mark Hutchinson, published in the Athenæum and the Journal of the Anthropological Institute, re- spectively, as well as those of Adolf Hübner, Gustave Fritsch, and Theophilus Hahn in the Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, adopted such interpretive strategies.51 While appreciating the paintings as fine art suggested that their producers could express 50 See Martin Hall, “The Proximity of Dr Bleek’s Bushman,” inMiscast, pp. 143–59. 51 See G.

B. Tylor aligned with the practice of writ- ing.52 Even oral traditions of communication, which Bleek and his collaborators strove to record, were thus frequently dis- counted, including explications offered by contemporary San who claimed to create paintings themselves.53 One of the most famous admirers of San rock art was the painter and art critic Roger Fry, whose 1910 essay “Bushman Paintings” represents one of the earliest critical responses to modernists’ interest in primitive art.54 This essay was largely in- formed by the 1909 publication Bushman Paintings, the catalog to a 1908 exhibition at the Anthropological Institute in Lon- don, which draws on the research of Bleek, Orpen, Lloyd, and their contemporaries.55 Fry, juxtaposing the paintings’ “Palaeo- lithic” and “ultra-primitive directness of vision” with the “Neo- lithic” desire to perceive “things in terms of concepts” and “to classify” them (“Bushman Paintings,” pp. 338, 337), implicitly denies the San painters and their descendants the authority to interpret their own paintings. It is precisely this “desire to clas- sify” that Fry himself exhibits as an art critic, and, moreover, it is what he considers lacking in African societies in his later ex- hibition review entitled “Negro Sculpture.”56 Positioning him- self as an authorized reader of African art, Fry exercises an in- 52 See E.

Fry’s reception of San rock images demonstrates how art and ethnology intertwine in this early formulation of a modern primitivist aesthetic—an aesthetic, like Schreiner’s, founded on an imaginative act of displacement. Claims that no authoritative translators of traditional San culture could be found helped further the interpretive license exercised by many early admirers of the rock paintings. Several nineteenth-century accounts in English and German, such as those of Adolf Hübner, Rev. C. G. Büttner, and Max Bartels,57 maintained that the peoples presently living in the vicinity of the paintings and carvings knew nothing, upon being ques- tioned, of their origin or process. While these claims usually supported arguments for the works’ antiquity, they also served to heighten the sense of mystery constructed around their os- tensibly silent and increasingly silenced creators. As Paul S. Landau suggests, these people would not be “bushmen” if they were not so elusive: “The essential quality of bushmen was that they were forever ‘vanishing.’ One can even treat this as the sine qua non of the definition of the ‘truest’ bushmen: they are never actually encountered” (“With Camera in Africa,” p. 130). The absence of Bushmen from most of The Story of an African Farm corresponds with this definition; in their absence, European primitives may populate the land instead. Even a  Romantic primitive like Waldo, who exhibits a particular sort of at-homeness in his natural surroundings, and who at the end of the novel seems to merge with the landscape in death by serv- ing as a hill-like perch to the chickens that clamor over his still form, alters the land by working if not owning it. The seemingly peaceful flock of sheep that Waldo regularly tends, in need of the grass whose seeds were a staple of the San diet, reminds us of the livestock for whose grazing land colonists pressed north- ward to the Orange River. While these peoples were forever vanishing, they were cer- tainly not invisible. The mythic Bushman survived in fiction  57 See Hübner, “Eingrabungen von Thiergestatten”; Rev. C. G. Büttner, “Bericht über Buschman Malereien in der Nähe von !Ameib Damaraland,” in Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesellschaft, in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, 10 (1878), 15; and Max Bartels, “Copien von Felszeichnungen der Buschmänner,” in Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesellschaft, in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, 24 (1892), 26 –27. </page> <page sequence="33"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 110 110 nineteenth-century literature as either memory or marauder, while the dispossessed San of nonfiction populated jails, urban labor forces, and outlying farms. The seemingly uncanny return of the San as the dis- placed and forced laborer, whom Waldo encounters while working as a transport rider, effects a breach in the fictional im- age of the elusive Bushman from a distant time constructed earlier in the novel. At this point in the narrative, “the facts” do indeed “creep in.” After returning from Grahamstown, Waldo reflects on an encounter that took place between him and his San coworker: “The Bushman boy was grilling ribs at the fire. He looked at me, and grinned from ear to ear. ‘Master was a little nice,’ he said, ‘and lay down in the road. Something might ride over master, so I carried him there.’ He grinned at me again. It was as though he said, ‘You and I are comrades. I have lain in a road too. I know all about it.’ When I turned my head from him I saw the earth, so pure after the rain, so green, so fresh, so blue;—and I was a drunken carrier, whom his leader had picked up in the mud, and laid at the roadside to sleep out his drink. . . . I sat up, and I took the brandy-flask out of my pocket, and I flung it as far as I could into the dark water. . . . I never drank again.” (African Farm, pp. 224–25) Perhaps representative of the groups of San spared as children during the border wars of the 1860s and taken into colonial servitude, the young wagon leader stands in sharp contrast to the painter with whom Waldo previously identified. On this oc- casion, Waldo’s imagined kinship repels him from his “com- rade,” himself, and the exploitation of human labor brought to the Cape by European colonists. As Waldo says of the “grind- ing, mechanical work” inflicted upon South Africans, “You may work a man’s body so that his soul dies” (p. 223). Waldo at this point in the novel is far from the idealized, creative, and free artisan who once identified with the Bush- man painter, and his incarnation as a soulless, exploited la- borer enslaves him to unimaginative drudgery. Loren Anthony identifies the liminal position of landless colonists like Otto, Waldo, and Lyndall as one of intense social ambivalence: “As landless whites they mark a point of aporia between fixed rela- </page> <page sequence="34"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 111 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 111 tions of landed whites and dispossessed blacks which Schreiner cannot question” (“Buried Narratives,” p. 11). As a transport rider, however, Waldo is not only landless but also soulless and enslaved. The figure of the Bushman in Schreiner’s novel thus delimits the trajectory of Waldo’s formative experiences within colonial South Africa, from idealized free artisan to abject en- slaved laborer. While Waldo recoils in horror and self-disgust from the latter position, it remains the only prominent one through which the elusive Bushman achieves visibility in the novel’s present. This presence, however, appears as a state of death-in-life; according to contemporary standards for authen- tic Bushman culture, this young laborer—separated from fam- ily and tradition—has undergone a kind of cultural death. The resistant San of Bleek’s and Orpen’s contemporary research find no place within The Story of an African Farm, a fictional world in which both the idealized and the abject are held at equal distance. The figure of the Bushman painter, unlike that of his transport-wagon leader kinsman, has attracted much attention among present-day critics, many of whom have attempted to qualify the novel’s statement on the extermination of these  native South African peoples. J. M. Coetzee glosses Schreiner’s narrative by explaining how “the Bushmen who lived by nature (in caves, not in huts) have been exterminated” (“Farm Novel,” p. 2). Other critics of African Farm have frequently reproduced in their essays the logic of Waldo’s eulogy, by claiming that “of course, the Bushman is exterminated,” 58 by referring to “the vanished San culture,”59 or by explaining that “the disappear- ance of the San . . . [was] almost total in the period and Karoo region in which [Schreiner] set The Story of an African Farm.”60 While such statements sometimes offer a more historically ac- curate account of the situation, the rhetoric of “disappear- ance”—employed for alternate purposes by conservationists 58 Gerald Monsman, “Olive Schreiner: Literature and the Politics of Power,” Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 30 (1988), 593. 59 Christopher Heywood, “Olive Schreiner and Literary Tradition,” in Olive Schreiner and After, p. 59. 60 Mark Sanders, Complicities: The Intellectual and Apartheid (Durham, N.C.: Duke Univ. Press, 2002), p. 217, n. 3. </page> <page sequence="35"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 112 112 nineteenth-century literature and colonialists alike—places the surviving San in an unusual temporal position: frequently relegated to the past or repre- sented as an eternally vanishing presence, they occupy the trou- bled spaces of a presentmoment repeatedly denied access to the future; to the very potential for agency. Schreiner’s statement that “the Boers have shot them all,” moreover, places sole blame for the massacre on the Boers of the 1830s and 1840s, while drawing attention away from the destructive effects of British colonial law and practice in the second half of the century. In her 1897 novel Trooper Peter Halket of Mashonaland Schreiner re- turnedmore directly to the British exploitation of African labor; the San, however, do not appear in this fictional world. While the San may no longer have formed a dominant presence in the particular region where Schreiner herself lived and wrote, they had neither completely vanished nor confined themselves to the role of drunken transport-wagon leaders. Schreiner’s omission of a contemporary San resistance to colo- nial authority and culture, as well as her choice to represent the San as victims rather than aggressors, certainly may have aided her critique of colonial corruption and virtual lawlessness on the unstable frontier.61 ThroughoutThe Story of an African Farm, as well as in her later political writings, however, Schreiner does not entertain the possibility of European repatriation or the  return of or compensation for annexed land. In her political essays on South Africa, Schreiner envisions a harmonious, home-rule social body in which residents of African and Euro- pean descent would live peacefully together: “These two great blended varieties, dark and light, will form the South African nation of the future, . . . always interacting side by side and forming our South African nation. . . . our social polity must be developed by ourselves through the interaction of our parts with one another and in harmony with our complex needs” (“The South African Nation,” p. 370). Aggressive indigenous resistance to European claims to the land would probably have disrupted such visions of regional social harmony and its ideal- 61 One of the primary reforms for which Louis Anthing unsuccessfully fought in- cluded the establishment of magistrate offices near the most volatile contact zones along the fluctuating frontier, which would ideally provide both Africans and Euro- peans with local venues at which they could file complaints. </page> <page sequence="36"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 113 THE STORY OF AN AFRIC AN FARM 113 ized representatives, such as Waldo. While these “varieties” of South Africans may interact “side by side,” in Schreiner’s social vision they do not wholly intermix. Reserving the same term for the “two infants removed from each other at birth” and subject to different climates, Schreiner offers an ethnological argument for the colonial indigene while nevertheless distinguishing “light” from “dark” varieties in a way that foresees the social and demographic landscape of South Africa’s future in the following century. Racial differ- ences in Schreiner’s political essays, like the cultural and his- torical differences in The Story of an African Farm, are partially acknowledged yet kept at a safe distance.62 Although the faded “Bushman-paintings” of Schreiner’s novel may reveal traces of a South African past and of a suppressed precolonial history, they do not provide their creators or ancestral interpreters with access to the present narrative moment. While these paintings may have been considered the “title-deeds” to the land, no one is present to claim it. Waldo serves as the sole interpreter of these paintings and symbolically enacts his current position as the undersigned’s rightful successor. University of Pennsylvania abstract Deborah L. Shapple, “Artful Tales of Origination in Olive Schreiner’s The Story of an African Farm” (pp. 78–114) Olive Schreiner’s The Story of an African Farm (1883) has long been considered an anti- colonial novel that nevertheless, because of its author’s affiliation with a European colonial culture, neglects to investigate the problem of disenfranchised African labor in significant detail. In this essay I reassess Schreiner’s anticolonialism by placing it in the context of her growing postcolonial aspirations. This rather paradoxical position of the colonist becoming a postcolonial manifests itself in the novel’s central artist figure, Waldo, who, while descended from European colonists, manages to make himself at home in his South African environment. Employing nineteenth-century ethnological and aesthetic discourses in the construction of this curious figure (which I refer to as the colonial indigene), Schreiner establishes a connection among the novel, colonial art, and an indigenous South African culture. The novel’s narrative present is set dur- ing a period of intense border struggle, and while indigenous artists like the San 62 Schreiner openly discusses her views of racial difference, in which she discour- ages interracial reproduction, in her 1901 essay “The Value of Human Varieties,” in Thoughts on South Africa, p. 386. </page> <page sequence="37"> 04-C3108  7/2/04  1:11 PM  Page 114 114 nineteenth-century literature (known to the colonists as the Bushmen) have disappeared from the novel’s narrative present, Schreiner’s colonial indigene takes their place. This imaginative displacement thus corresponds with a demographic one, while also manifesting itself in The Story of an African Farm through a fetishistic aesthetic and the uncanny return of a frequently overlooked African laborer. </page> </plain_text>
