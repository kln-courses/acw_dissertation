<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Further Observations on the Symbolic Meaning of the Club in the Statue of Kaniska In 1967, I published a study on the symbolic meaning of the club or mace in the icono? graphy of the Kus?na kings C). In that article, I tried to follow, on the one hand, the icono graphic transformations that the passing of time had worked on that element, constantly included among the attributes of the Kus?na rulers from Vima Kadphises to Huviska, and on the other, to clarify what its symbolic meaning may have been and the reasons for its close and persistent relation with kingship. A clearly Heraclean type of club appeared in certain images of Vima Kadphises ? undoubtedly influenced to a great degree by Indo Greek coins, particularly those of the Euthydemids, which depicted Heracles as a dynastic divinity (2) ? while other coins of Vima showed ever more stylized and schematic repre? sentations of the knotty club which in some cases almost took on the aspect of a plant or bough (3). Apart from a few exceptions, this element kept its vegetal appearance in Huviska's coinage, while assuming a completely different and quite singular form in the statue of Kaniska (fig. 1) found in the devakula of M?t at Mathur? (4). The study of the transformations that the club underwent, first on Vima's coins and then in connection with the images of the kings who followed him, indicated that, although at the beginning the influence of the iconography of Heracles had been determining in rep? resentations of this weapon, it had then changed aspect very quickly, while still remaining constantly associated with the images of the Kus?na kings. This seems to show that from the very beginning it had, or very soon thereafter, it took on its own precise symbolic mean? ing, even apart from any connection with the figure of the divine hero.

The solar gods are entrusted with the task of using this weapon to fight the forces of evil that threaten to upset the order of creation, the basis for the life of mankind and the universe; the chthonic gods guard the moral order through the punishment of the guilty and the judgement of the souls of the dead. Further? more, during the New Year festival in the Iranian world, the king had the task of restor? ing cosmic order by repeating the battle of the hero Fand?n-Thraetaona against the demon Azi-Dah?ka who had imprisoned the waters, causing the parched earth to become sterile. The king's weapon on this occasion was in face a mace. Similar myths and rites of regenera? tion of time and disturbed cosmic rhythms were known in India, where the king was entrusted with the maintenance of cosmic order (5). I was led by this and other data to think that the club, as associated with the images of the Kus?na kings, might symbolize the ruler's task of guarding cosmic and moral order, being linked to the idea of justice as the basis of that order (6). Nevertheless, in my earlier work, the iconographic study of the club or mace in the various images of the Kus?na kings and the collection of data useful for clarifying this weapon's symbolic meaning were two channels of research which, although both originated from a single interest and aimed at resolving the same problem, still did not get to the point of merging together, as would have happened had the iconographic research come up with elements that might have helped to support the hypothesis I had advanced. That hypothesis, referring to the meaning of the club, rested in particular on data drawn from mythical and religious traditions and on epigraphic documents of the Kus?na age or the periods that followed; I might add that this data seemed and still do seem to me sufficient in themselves to support my thesis. The aim of my iconographic research on the weapon was to demonstrate its constant association with the royal image, and to highlight its rapid changes in form. In my opinion, this latter phenomenon seemed to indicate ? as I have already noted ? that in Kus?na royal icono? graphy, the mace had its own precise symbolic meaning, which could not be explained solely by the influence of Heracles as a dynastic divinity. I should now like to add some further observations on the iconography of the mace itself to my earlier article. They may be useful in helping to clarify the weapon's symbolic meaning, and may also lend further support to my interpretation of that meaning. The mace held by Kaniska in the statue from M?t has, as I have already pointed out, a singular characteristic that has neither precedents nor later imitations on Kus?na coins: the weapon's surface is divided up into various vertical faces that increase in number from the tip, which rests on the ground, up to the handle; the mace also grows thinner as it rises. The body of the mace itself is bound by five richly decorated bands, clearly imita (5) For the topics briefly summarized here and for the bibliography that refers to them, see Mariottini Spagnoli, op. cit., pp. 257-63. (6) Ibid., pp. 263-67. 461</page><page sequence="3">tions in stone of metallic elements. These bands also mark the points from which the number of faces into which the weapon's surface is divided increases from bottom to top. The head of a makara with open jaws emerges from the lowest band. The mace is held perpen? dicular to the ground. When we observe the weapon as a whole we can easily note that it bears a remar? kable resemblance to a column in both form and position (7). As is well-known, the columns of various Indian temples, especially starting with the Gupta era, have their sur? faces divided up into vertical faces that often gradually increase in number from bottom to top. Furthermore, the shaft is quite often surrounded by decorated bands that mark the points from which the number of faces changes (8). Then too, the bands, clearly imitat? ing metallic elements, seem to have the function of reinforcing the column as well as that of decorating it. This leads us to think that both the mace of Kaniska and the columns derived from wooden prototypes. But apart from the columns of the Gupta period, there exists an older example that certainly goes back to a period far earlier than Kaniska's reign, and that offers us an icono graphic precedent for the mace the king holds: it is the pillar of Besnagar (?) (figs. 2, 3), erected in the last quarter of the 2nd cent. B.C. by Heliodorus, son of Dion, and Greek ambassador of King Antialcidas to the court of the Sunga King Bh?gabhadra of Vidis? (10). The pillar's shaft, which grows narrower towards the top, is octagonal in its lower part, bound by a garland of half lotus flowers, and has sixteen sides in the central section and thirty-two in the upper part, while the zone just beneath the capital is cylin? drical. The middle part is separated from the upper ones by another garland decoration. According to VogePs description (X1), the surface of Kaniska's mace is almost cylindrical in the section between the two bands closest to the handle. The parts between the second and fourth band have sixteen sides and the lower part has eight. I think it quite signifi? cant that the weapon held by the Kus?na king bears such close resemblance to a pillar or column, in both its structure and its decoration. A conception widespread in the Mesopo tamian world links precise cosmological values to the column; and we find this same idea again in India, perfectly expressed in the symbolism of Asoka's pillars. Here the shaft, (7) The similarities in form and structure that exist between the mace of Kaniska and one type of Indian column, that represented by the pillar of Besnagar, are clearly pointed out by Rosenfield, op. cit., p. 179, note 15.

The well-known capital from S?rn?th offers the most complete and obvious expression of this series of values (12). One should note, though, that the pillar-axis mundi idea is closely linked to that of the cosmic tree, that is, to a plant element which is the symbol of creation. Furthermore, the fact that the pillar and the cosmic tree may represent different expressions of the same basic idea is supported by the pillar's being essentially just the stylization of a plant, since it is usually made up of a shaft surmounted by a flower-shaped capital, or one adorned with leaves of various kinds. In the Indian world especially, the pillar or column has a lotus flower capital, and the best-known symbol for figuratively expressing the idea of creation in India is a lotus stem emerging from the jaws of a makara or other elements such as a vase, and the navel or the mouth of a homunculus, all closely linked to the idea of the primor? dial waters as the universal matrix from which all forms were born. The symbolism of the lotus stem, representing creation in the Puranic tradition, is accompanied by the cosmogonic myth, expressed in Vedic literature; according to this, the cosmic tree grows out of the navel of a primordial being (Varuna, Mah?yaksa, Asura, Brahman, N?r?yana), whose body floats on the waters (13). Creation is thus linked, on the one hand, to an aquatic element understood as potentiality, because it is the Indistinct, the origin of all things, and, on the other hand, its realization is materially shown in a vegetal organism, be it tree or lotus stem. The figurative expression of this element, which is at one and the same time the manifestation of creation and its support, is extremely varied. Bosch has shown that the symbolism of the tree-trunk or the plant stem lies at the roots of highly diverse figurative elements; these, however, share the idea of the axis and the cosmic centre, as, for instance, the pillar, the st?pa, the linga and the anthropomorphic image of the god, not excluding that of the Buddha (14). On one of the entrance pillars of the St?pa of the Saints (St?pa 2) at S?nchi (15), we can see a pillar topped by lions set back to back; from the capital, shaped like a lotus flower, there issue two stalks, each bearing a lotus bud. This demonstrates once again that the pillar is not only connected with a vegetal element endowed with a precise symbolic meaning, but is also considered in itself (12) For the meaning of the various figurative elements that appear on the capital of S?rn?th, see J. Przilusky, ? Le symbolisme du pilier de Sarnath?, Melanges Linossier, II, Paris, 1932, pp. 481-98; B. Rowland, ?

Indian architecture offers us many examples of columns that emerge from a vase (16), a figurative motif that very obviously alludes to the waters from which creation originated. Then too, in its figurative representations, that same cosmic plant sinks its roots into a vase or emerges, as we have already remarked, from the mouth or navel of a homunculus, or at times from the jaws of a makara, these too symbols of the primordial waters from which life was born. Both the column or pillar and the plant are therefore tied in with the idea of creation, of which they are the symbol and the visible manifestation. And yet that manifestation does not merely express the concept of a creative force that from a state of potentiality manages to realize itself and take on form; it also represents the passing from a chaotic and undif ferentiated element to a precise and unchangeable order, the basis of and condition for creation's very survival. This order is expressed in the idea of a central axis that sustains the cosmos and is the element around which the universe is established. The idea of the universe as an entity subjected to a precise order is already clearly expressed in the sym? bolism of the tree, an element in which the various parts are united by organic bonds on the one hand, and by structural ones on the other. But the idea of cosmic order is perhaps realized with even greater clarity and a more complete and rational form in the symbolism of the column or pillar. We have already seen that in the Maurya pillars, and in the S?rn?th capital in particular, various elements refer to the structure of the universe and to its precise systematization. In the latter monument, we see four animals on the abacus, probably symbolizing the four cardinal points or the four heavenly rivers (17); the abacus itself is surmounted by four lions, clearly solar in nature, the number of which nevertheless seems to recall the quadruple division of space. If we then observe the pillar of Besnagar, we find that we are dealing with a different structure: to be exact, the shaft is no longer cylindrical, but has its surface divided up, as we have seen, into different vertical faces that vary in number, thus allowing us to distinguish different sections in the column itself, the first octagonal at the base, the second showing sixteen faces in the middle, the third with thirty-two and the part nearest the capital being cylindrical. I think there is meaning in this subdivision of the surface into an increasing number of faces, proceeding gradually towards the top. Above all, the number of those faces ? eight, sixteen, and thirty-two ? can all be divided by four, a number which brings us back to the fundamental subdivision of space, which in further divisions is split up into a double and quadruple number of zones, with a procedure that can go on endlessly. These successive divisions also seem to indicate the (le) Columns or pillars emerging from a vase can be found, to mention only a few of the very oldest examples, in the caityas of Kanheri, Junnar and K?rli, and in Vih?ra no. 10 at N?sik (Brown, op. cit., pis. XXI, XXIV, XXIX) and at Mathur? (Coomaraswamy, Yaksas, cit., II, pi. 18, fig. 3; Bosch, op. cit., pi. 30 c). For the symbolic meaning of the vase, cf. Coomaraswamy, Yaksas, cit, II, pp. 61-64.

A clear allusion to cosmic space and its subdivisions can be observed in the vault of a cave at Qyzil, topped by the Buddhist lotus from which there spreads out a large peacock tail divided into sixteen sectors (18). One cannot help but note the resemblance to the sym? bolic meaning of the pillar of Besnagar: in both cases, the surface at the artist's disposition is divided up into sixteen sectors or a number of parts multiple of four, and furthermore, both the vault and the pillar have a lotus flower at the top. This division, based on the fundamental concept of the quaternary division of cosmic space from which further sub? divisions take their origin, is found again in many other elements associated with the cosmic axis or in some way bound up with spatial symbolism. Let us recall the linga, for ex? ample: a particular type of linga called m?nusa (manmade) is made up of three parts known as brahmabh?ga, visnubh?ga and rudrabh?ga; the lower section is square, the middle octagonal and the upper cylindrical (19). Banerjea points out that those texts which describe the columns of the late Gupta period or the start of the mediaeval period, distinguish three parts called brahmak?nda, visnuk?nda and rudrak?nda (20). We also know that the Buddha's body symbolizes the cosmic pillar and it is perhaps significant that it is characterized by thirty-two main laksanas (21). The lotus flower, to which spatial symbolism is so often connected (22), also has in general eight, sixteen or thirty-two petals (23). In the same way, the wheel, a very ancient solar symbol that takes on such great (18) A. Soper, ? The Dome of Heaven ?, The Art Bulletin, XXIX, 1947, pp. 234 f. (19) T.A.G.

Nevertheless, ac? cording to Acharya's translation of M?nas?ra [Architecture of M?nas?ra, Allahabad, 1933, IV, ch. XV, 19-23) these shafts are stated to be uniform from bottom to top. (21) For the problem of the relationship be? tween the cosmic axis and the division of space into four quarters, which originates a further sub? division into eight, sixteen, thirty-two or more parts, cf. Bosch, op. cit., pp. 83-89. The author points out that this division of space, based on a two-dimensional system, is flanked by another that takes a third dimension into consideration. The zenith is thought to be above the cardinal points, and that gives a division into five, nine, seventeen and thirty-three parts (4+1; 8 + 1; 16 + 1; 32 + 1). (22) Cf. Coomaraswamy, Elements..., cit., p. 18. This scholar recalls that, as stated in the Maitri Upanisad (VI, 2): ?This lotus (of the heart, hrt-puskara) is verily the same as Space (?k?sa); these four quarters and four interquarters are its surrounding petals ?. (23) For the eight-petalled lotus: Rowland, The Art and Architecture of India, cit., fig. 11; Kramrisch, op. cit., fig. 11 (central medallion of the left pillar; behind the front row of petals there is another that doubles its number), fig. 16.

I believe that the data assembled here seem to show fairly clearly that the number of faces into which the various sections of the Besnagar pillar are divided is not merely casual, but closely linked to the cosmological meaning of the monument itself. The mace Kaniska holds in the Mat statue not only offers an external resemblance to that pillar or to later ones, but the very same idea seems to lie at the origin of both mace and pillars. The pillar is a representation of the cosmic axis and is tied in with the tree and the lotus, symbols of a creation beginning from the primordial waters; in fact, the pillar often emerges from a vase that alludes to the aquatic element, matrix of all things. In its lower part, Kaniska's mace has a makara head (26), a widespread symbol for the waters and one very often connected with the cosmic lotus in its figurative representations. The weapon's surface is divided up into various sections showing a different number of faces {eight and sixteen, from bottom to top), to which is added a cylindrical section below the handle; the pillar of Besnagar is divided into three parts that show eight, sixteen and thirty-two faces respectively, above which is a fourth cylindrical part in the area just beneath the capital. The number of faces into which the pillar's surface is divided seems referable to a division of cosmic space that origi (24) Cf. Coomaraswamy, Elements..., cit., pp. 25 S.

(26) Rosenfield, op. cit., pp. 179-180, in explaining the presence of the makara head on the mace of Kaniska, underlines the animal's evil and aggressive nature, which should be intended to heighten the sense of fear aroused by the weapon. I think that this function may indeed be one of the reasons for the animaPs presence on the mace (Mariottini Spagnoli, op. tit., p. 266), but I feel that it is related above all to the symbolism of a cosmological nature expressed in the weapon. Let us remember that various types of arms, such as the bow and arrow, the sword, the dagger and the spear, are seen to stand for the stem of the cosmic plant, as Bosch points out, op. cit., p. 128. This writer also underlines the n?ga's frequent association with the arrow or the Java? nese kris; on the blade of the latter the animaPs body often assumes a clearly plant-like aspect and symbolizes the stem of the cosmic plant. The aquatic monster, makara or n?ga, is therefore symbolically related to the cosmic plant and in particular to the parvan or node of the plant itself, in both its form and its aquatic nature (ibid., pp. 129 f.). Let us also note that a makara figure found at Besnagar probably sur? mounted the capital of a pillar that must have been fairly similar to that erected by Heliodorus (Cunningham, Reports of Tours..., cit., pp. 42 f.; Bhandarkar, op. cit., pp. 189 f., pi. 54 b). And finally, the figure of a winged lion with a serpent's tail was found at Mathur?, it too perhaps destined to be placed on a pillar. The animal's tail is divided into various faces and is surrounded by a decorative band exactly like those that appear on Kaniska's mace and the Gupta columns (Vogel, La Sculpture de Mathur?, cit., pi. XXV). 466</page><page sequence="10">nates with the four cardinal points and that is intimately connected with the monument's cosmological meaning (27). In my opinion, the analogies that make the mace so closely resemble a pillar can be explained by the fact that both these objects express similar symbolic values. At the basis of them both lies the idea of creation originating from the waters and manifesting itself in the form of a cosmic plant to which ? as we have already seen ? both the pillar and the club are intimately linked. This also explains why the weapon, when associated with the images of the Kus?na kings, is so frequently transformed into a vegetal element (28). But both the pillar and Kaniska's mace express the concept of an unalterable and omnipresent order according to which the universe is organized and which is the condition of its existence. Furthermore, the universe itself is essentially conceived of as a spatial entity that has an axis as its centre and support, and is subjected to precise subdivisions grounded on the fundamental division of space into the four cardinal points. While elements referring to the division of space only appear at the top of the pillars of the Maurya period, in the Besnagar pillar and others of the same type the idea of the subdivision of cosmic space is already expressed in the shaft, that shows various parts with a polygonal section containing a number of sides increasing according to a precise criterion, until in the upper part the shaft shows a circular section (29). The structure that charac? terizes Kaniska's mace is exactly similar. The data and observations I have presented here seem to me to permit the formula? tion of this hypothesis: the peculiar weapon held by the great Kus?na king may have been deliberately assimilated to a pillar, since we find in it the cosmological values associated with the pillar in the Indian world. It therefore takes on the value of an axis mundi, the structure of which, furthermore, expresses the idea of the order on which the universe is based. The fact that the Kus?na emperor is resting his hand on this weapon seems to lead us back to the idea already presented in my earlier article, that of the ruler's basic function: to guarantee and protect both cosmic and moral order, since the mace also seems to be closely associated with the idea of punishment and therefore of the re-establishment of justice (30). This group of ideological values, connected with the figure of the king in both the Iranian and Indian worlds, seems to flow into the Kus?na conception of kingship. But perhaps the association of the king with an element that according to ,me takes on clear cosmological meaning, returns us above all to a conception of kingship not unlike that ex? pressed in the pillars of Asoka. (27) We also find a capital shaped like a lotus flower on top of the Besnagar pillar; and while it is not present on Kaniska's mace, the lotus flower can be seen just below the handle of a mace very like that of the Kus?na king, held by a dwarf in a relief on the st?pa of N?g?rjunikonda (Mariottini Spagnoli, op. cit., p. 256, fig. 16). (28) See note 3. (29) This gradual passing from the polygonal to the circular section is, as we have seen, also to he met with in the structure of the lihga (see p. 10). (30) Cf. Mariottini Spagnoli, op. cit., pp. 263-66; Rosenfield, op. cit., p. 180. 467</page><page sequence="11">If the mace held by Kaniska is really to be linked to the cosmic pillar that supports the universe, it in some way represents the dharma of that universe, since dharma means ? bearer ? (31) and is at one and the same time ? the structural principle of the universe and a consequent rule of life ? (32). So that if we extend the idea of this support from the strictly cosmological to the moral field ? as the connection of the mace with the idea of justice would seem to allow ? at least certain aspects of Kus?na kingship appear to us to be founded on an order of ideas somehow similar to that which had served as the basis for Asoka's ideal of universal sovereignty. Of course we should not forget that the mace is principally a weapon and therefore an instrument of combat; but I should like to emphasize that it is also and above all a weapon closely bound up with the principle that creates and gives order to the universe, which takes on visible expression in its very shape. In the king's hand, then, it appears to be the expression of an active force linked to a vision of cosmic and moral order ? understood as universal law ?? that probably constitutes the ideological basis of Kus?na power and political action.
