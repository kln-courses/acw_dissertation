<plain_text><page sequence="1">book reviews Flatiron: A Photographic History of the World's First Steel Frame Skyscraper, 1901-1990 Peter Gwillim Kreitler The AIA Press, 1990 217 pp., 103 photographs (26 color) $29.95 (cloth) This anthology of photographs is the product of two romances. The first is Peter Gwillim Kreitler's romance with collecting photographs. The second is the long-standing love affair between professional photographers and the Flatiron Building in New York City, that freestanding triangular tower marking the crossing of Broadway and Fifth Avenue at Twenty-Third Street. It is easy to understand why photographers have been drawn to this building since its construction by the George A. Fuller Company in 1902 to designs by Daniel Burnham. Although Broadway creates a number of triangular sites as it slices through the Manhattan grid, the Flatiron is the only building that occupies the entire triangle and carries this shape skyward in a monolithic mass. The narrowness of the acute angle at its apex accentuates the impression. Kreitler, an amateur photographer and full-time pastor of St. Matthews Church in Pacific Palisades, has collected photographs since 1975. His mission here was to share this enthusiasm by assembling in one volume work by many distinguished artists who have trained their lenses on this iconographic skyscraper. The result of his quest is 103 photographs arranged chronologically from anonymous construction shots taken in 1901 to the author's own mirror-image color prints of 1990. The book presents the print on the right page opposite a short text drawn from a variety of historical and literary sources. Among the best known images are Alfred Stieglitz's view through the snowy haze of Madison Square (1902-3) and Edward Steichen's portrait in the rainy dusk (1904). Both of these prints appeared as photogravure reproductions in Camera Work, a journal edited by Stieglitz and friends, and figured prominently in the work of the Photo-Secession movement. Walter Gropius's 1928 photograph severs the building from its base and tilts it from the vertical, as if to undermine this traitor to the modern cause that conceals its steel structure behind limestone cladding. Robert L. Bracklow, Alvin L. Coburn, and Joseph Byron are other early photographers of the building: Berenice Abbott, Andre Kertesz, Andreas Feininger, and Rudy Burckhardt shot it during the 1930s and 1940s; George Tice, Joel Meyerowitz, Lee Friedlander, and Nina Prantis are among the more recent contributors. A series of five stereographs from 1903 shows how images of the building were conveyed to a wide public. The photographic display encompasses the technical development of the art from vintage silver and platinum prints, photogravure, and stereograph to the modern color print and cibachrome. The early prints are predominantly eye-level shots dependent on lighting conditions for their effect. Prints made after 1960 begin to emphasize the artist's manipulation of the subject: hand-held blurred-focus night views by David Moses Attie (1961) and David Vestal (1963), Ernst Haas's midnight blue, high contrast dye-transfer-from-slide (1964). The written excerpts provide an informative anecdotal history of the building, although they do not always measure up to Kreitler's desire to match the commentary to the photograph as if it were written expressly for it. Among the most interesting passages are the contemporary accounts, starting with the Fuller Company's advertisement for the building. Emphasizing numerous advantages, including six "rapid-running" Otis elevators, fireproofed woodwork, and free heat and lighting, the advertisement is a reminder that the Flatiron was not a flagship corporate headquarters but a speculative commercial office building. Although most public reaction was favorable, the building did not want for detractors, starting with the review in Architectural Record that dismissed it as "a mere bird-cage for your tenant. The commentary suffers from a redundancy both of source (Paul Goldberger and Robert Stern each make several appearances) and of content (the descriptive similes that liken the building to a ship, a locomotive, an arrowhead, an account book). The writing is often perceptive but rarely analytic, and it emphasizes the building as object (as in Stern's distinction between its dual identity as tower and palazzo) over its broader urban role. Missing is a perspective like that of Mario Manieri-Elia's essay in The American City, which argues that the Flatiron was not intended to "accentuate the individual, organic independence of the building [but rather as] a forceful perspective accentuation of the divergence of the two streets."' Manieri-Elia cites Burnham's own words to this effect: "There are two sorts of architectural beauty, first, that of an individual building; and second, that of an orderly and fitting arrangement of many buildings. The relationship of all the buildings is more important than anything else."2 This passage might have provided a more apt concluding quotation than the one selected by Kreitler: Burnham's famous dictum, "Make no little plans." It is doubtless a bit unfair to chide the compiler of this handsome and fascinating record for his unfamiliarity with the literature. The book is not a scholarly treatise but a labor of love, its creator a part-time amateur photographer. We can forgive him as well (if not the AIA Press) for the unsubstantiated subtitular claim that the Flatiron is "the world's first steelframe skyscraper," a designation at September 1992 JAE 46/1 56</page><page sequence="2">2.

The considerable appeal of this book is in the photographs, for their intrinsic interest as works of art, for the stories they tell, and for the questions they raise. Two of these questions are raised directly in the text. In his foreword to the book, Weston J. Naef, curator of photographs at the Getty Museum, asks about the photographers who did not shoot the building: Paul Strand, Walker Evans, Margaret Bourke-White, and Harry Callahan. The second question arises from the work itself: Why are so many shots filtered through foliage, haze, rain, snow, and dusk? A passage drawn from Art in America suggests that it was "only in gray and muted light that the sharp contours of the new city appeared sufficienty refined for this first generation of urban-initiates. Only then, as they would put it, did the city become truly 'sublime' and 'enchanting'." This reading indicates a need to deny the mercantile logic that creates the modern metropolis even as we celebrate its icons. Finally, and on a lighter note, there is a history of New York fad, fashion, and infrastructural technology running through these pages and these prints. The chronicle incudes flag-pole sitters and the White-Wings street sweeper; the disappearance of overhead wires and horse-drawn carriages; and the successive uptown relocations of the theater district and the Ladies Mile. Several texts refer to the peculiar effects of the tall building on wind patterns, producing what one observer called "a new form of hurricane." These gusts gave rise to at least one popular expression, the origin of which is recounted in the following verse by your reviewer, whose previous loft apartment afforded a Flatiron view for eleven years. Twenty-Three Skidoo Listen, my colleagues, and you shall have heard of a building where Fifth Ave. goes by Twenty-Third at the crossing of Broadway, on Madison Square (the original Garden was actually there!) It fills a triangular small piece of earth like the prow of a ship sailing north from its berth. The shape of the building (in plan, from above) recalls the flatiron it makes you think of. It was crafted by Burnham in 1902, in the Renaissance style and a classical hue. Though put up by Fuller (his one brush with fame?) the shape of the building prevails for its name. 57 book reviews ' I t .. I ll I t , I il " .*:: I i t I . gw t; .. ;=: .:.. , ';-'.,-"~ .. ,Jt!

This steel-framed palazzo of twenty floors stacked created a stir with its urban impact. For when it was built (mark the time, note the date) was three decades preceding the Empire State. Photographers came by reflex and by habit; among them were Steichen and Stieglitz and Abbott. Majestic, imposing, and oozing with flair, a quite different aspect was equally rare: Twas the air! whipped around, aeronautically sped, which produced an effect that could turn a man's head. For the turbulent breezes, on hitting the ground, were reversed in direction-they turned right around- thus producing an updraft, a blast from below, which could rustle a bustle or loosen a bow. Then, in days of long dresses, so modest, so chaste, a mere glimpse of an ankle left ladies red-faced, and a well-turned leg, once released from its wraps, could attract quite a crowd of appreciative chaps. Thus the corner where Broadway cuts through Twenty-Third was a favorite roost for the masculine bird. Now we call a man sexist, an arrogant sort, for girl-watching, whisting, and other such sport. And doubtless the point is correct and well-taken: The chauvinist view is both crass and mistaken. But try to imagine an earlier time, when sexual mores gave reason and rhyme to suppress all discussion of matters of flesh, when manners decreed, "Don't be rude! Don't be fresh!" In that prudish context, in that frame of mind, when most close encounters were optic in kind, imagine the passion, the thrill, the delight, when anatomy's secrets were seen in the light! So to guard public morals at Fifth and Broadway a constabular warning was heard night and day near the building constructed in 1902 when a well-turned leg came at last into view: "Twenty-Three Skidoo!"

Monsters of Architecture: Anthropomorphism in Architectural Theory Marco Frascari Rowman and Littlefield, 1991 140 pp., 38 illustrations $43.00 (cloth) This provocative book by Marco Frascari, accompanied by photographs and demonstrative drawings by the author, is a work "to think with" from within the discipline of architecture about the most pressing problems confronting our profession. Frascari's discourse belongs to a tradition of architectural theory seeking the "reconstruction" of architecture in a time of crisis. It seeks to open up questions without assuming the possibility of final answers, pondering the historical traces of architecture and unearthing hints that may help us in our difficult task of constructing a human order without forgetting the specific reality of our post-Cartesian culture. Frascari argues for a radicalization of the phenomenological insights present in Merleau-Ponty's philosophy. In this context, he posits the relationship between architectural works and the human body as metonymic and no longer metaphoric (the dominant relationship in classical theory): "Architects can no longer do without the identification of the human body and its elements in the architectural body" (p. 4). Avoiding naive isomorphic relationships, the issue is to use the body to attain new kinds of instrumental and theoretical representations, to recognize "corporeal presence," and to "make visible that which is invisible" (p. 4), the inveterate task of the architect. Besides the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, Frascari uses the works of Giambattista Vico, Gianni Vattimo, and Hans Blumenberg as cornerstones for his hopeful view on a potential architecture of presence. He reminds us, with Vattimo, that it is not enough to demythicize demythization to rediscover the truth in the mythopoeic. It is necessary to preserve the universality of dreaming and the continuation of the dream (p. 8). The process of demythi- zation in architecture, which began in the eighteenth century, refuses the corporeal nature of building and focuses on a limited functionalism.
