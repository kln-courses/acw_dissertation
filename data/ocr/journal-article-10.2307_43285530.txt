But in addition to the well-known deities of the Olympic pantheon, Greek religion also featured a consid- erable number of lesser deities, some of which were imagined as a combination of human and animal parts (mixanthropoi). In the ancient world, satyrs, centaurs and sirens (to mention just a few examples of mixanthropic divinities) never consti- tuted a coherent group of deities, yet they shared not only the physical feature of composition but also a number of cultural associations resulting from their status as physical composites between humans and animals. Aston's monograph - a revised version of her Exeter Ph.D. thesis - offers the first book-length study of this much under- appreciated aspect of ancient Greek religion. Aston takes mixanthropic gods to be 'symbolic entities'. Her main focus is distinctly on their role as a mode of imagining and exploring the nature of the divine. To this end Aston places mixan- thropic deities within the larger spectrum of divine representation. Her investigation is motivated by a series of questions revolving around the link between their physiology, their personality and their cults: 'Why were certain deities depicted using this very striking and particular form? Do the deities thus imagined and depicted have anything else in common, besides their physical form?' (15). Aston's detailed introduction sets out the framework of her investigation, flagging questions and problems central to the study of mixanthropic gods: their relationship to ancient Greek thought about the nature of animals and their relationship to humans; the benefit of including cross-cultural material from Egypt and the Near East; and the role of myth and ancient paradoxography as preferred contexts for the imagination of mixan- thropic gods. The argument here is conceptually reflected and nicely introduces the subsequent investigation of mixanthropy and divinity. The main body of the book comes in ten chapters divided into three sections: section 1, 'Cults and composition of mixanthropic deities' (chapters 1-3), offers a detailed description of the physiological composition of mixanthropic divinities, and their personalities and cults. A vast amount of information is competently covered; Aston shows skill and diligence in making the literary and the material evidence speak to each other. Section 2 (chapters 4-6) is entitled 'Movement, absence and loss' and identifies a number of 'dominant themes' emerging from the representation of mixanthropic divinities discussed in the previous section. Mixanthropic gods and godesses, Aston shows, inhabit a contested space between divinity and monstrosity; therefore, themes and patterns of their represen- tation revolve around questions of their expulsion or absence from a particular location (chapter 4) or their association with both temporal and/or spatial distance (chapter 5). The region of Arcadia combines such imagery in a landscape imagined to be particularly rich in mixanthropic divinities; but, as Aston shows, we should not put this down simply to the alleged primitivism of Arcadia. Rather, mixanthropic divinities play a key role in the continuing self-fashioning of the Arcadian landscape as a place both pastoral and divinely inspired (chapter 6). Section 3 (chapters 7-10), 'Mixanthropy and representation', ties up a number of loose ends emerging from the investigation of representations of mixanthropy in the previous chapters, including the intricate link between mixanthropic divinities and metamorphosis, the significance of the mask in their representation, their relationship to other gods and their affinity to the monstrous. A short conclusion sums up the major points of the comparative investigation of mixanthropic divinity in mythological and iconographie repre- sentation. The originality of the book certainly lies its revelation of thematic correspondences between the representation of mixanthropic divinities in very different texts and contexts. Moreover, Aston does an excellent job in accessing and structuring a vast amount of heterogeneous material without falling into the trap of oversimplifying what is ultimately a complex and many-layered topic. Throughout, she avoids the temptation to speculate about the meaning of 'mixanthropy as such'. Instead, she offers a nuanced picture of the representation and imagination of individual mixanthropic divinities at the intersection of art, mythology and religion. Of these, the first two certainly receive the most attention: the book abounds in detailed observations of the principles and practices of</page><page sequence="2">212 REVIEWS OF BOOKS mixanthropy as represented in iconography and literature. At times, however, one would have wanted Aston to develop certain aspects of her argument in more detail. For example, more could have been made to reveal the religious thought informing the thematic investigation carried out in section two. For this reader at least, it was not always clear where the investigation was headed. Ancient Greek religion is, to a significant extent, grounded in a triangular symbolic relationship among humans (as those sacrificing), animals (as those sacrificed) and the gods (as the beneficiaries of the sacrifice). How does mixanthropy relate to this relationship? Does it complicate it? Invert it? Redefine it? However, such considerations should not take away from the immense effort and expertise that have informed this book. Despite its somewhat unwieldy title, the book is well-written and Aston has adopted an accessible, almost conversational style apposite to its subject. The book is also beautifully illustrated with many images rendering visible the physical features of mixanthropic divinities. It is invaluable reading for all those who want to extend their understanding of the Greek imagination of the gods as being both like and unlike human beings and - occasionally at least - both like and unlike animals.
