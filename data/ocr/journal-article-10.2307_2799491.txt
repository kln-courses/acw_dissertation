<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HOUSEBOARDS OF THE TELEFOMIN SUB- DISTRICT, NEW GUINEA BARRY CRAIG University of Sydney Introduction Telefomin is an administrative sub-district in the extreme west of the Australian New Guinea highlands and is part of the Sepik District. The people, called Tele- folmin, inhabit the basin of a valley, once a lake-bed and now dissected and drained by the Sepik River headwaters. The valley is surrounded by forested ranges of up to I I,000 feet in height. Most of the Telefolmin live between 4,500 and s,ooo feet 1410 1410 30' 1420 tI ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~40 30' ,, -1;%s TERRITORY z X l~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:0. 5% Mianmin O ~i k ep14~ ~~NEW GUINEA }~ ~ ~ ~~~ Itikln R .rBS ~ X 5 n~~~~r 1-~~~~~~~~~~e O tribes /7 R !TERRITORY~'ts #S * I OF PAPUA \ l l 56 kRometres St c l .

Relationships between the Telefolmin and the neighbouring tribes (shown on the map) were not always peaceful. Warfare tended to occur along east-west lines, and trade and alliance along north-south lines. The Telefolmin house is a single room about twelve feet square with two hearths, a small entrance, and no windows. The roof is gabled and leaves of pan- danus, giant ginger, bamboo or grass are used as roofing material. Walls are of vertically placed split-timber, lined inside with pandanus or softwood bark sheets. The floor is raised a foot or two off the ground and lined with sheets of bark. The hearth is a 'well' made with timber battens filled with stones and finished off with clay. Firewood is dried in racks above the hearths. A Telefolniin family may have several houses: a village house, a pig house and garden houses. All are built as described above except where a man decides that a lean-to will save him going to the trouble of building a more respectable structure. Except in rare instances, only a village house may be accorded the distinction of having a houseboard (amitung). Indeed, the presence or absence of houseboards could be used as the criterion for the distinction between villages and mere garden- or pig-camps. However, not every village house has a houseboard. In May I965, a sample which included all Telefomin villages but one, yielded a total of 74 houseboards, I54 village dwellings, and I30 'eligible' dwellings. Thus, 48 per cent. of all village dwellings, and 57 per cent. of all 'eligible' dwellings, had houseboards. Houses classed as non-eligible were all non-village structures, menstruation huts, and any structure not built according to the traditional pattern. Thus houses of European or quasi-European design, where a doorway of a man's height is situated in the side of the house, are unable to incorporate a houseboard, which has but a small opening and is placed so that the top end of the board reaches to the peak of the gable. Some families have overcome this difficulty by building hybrid houses where one half is traditional and the other half quasi-European. This usually accommodates traditional and sophisticated members of the family in their respective sections of the house. As in most Highland communities, the men commonly sleep apart from their women-folk in separate men's houses. The women, children and animals sleep in the family houses. Accordingly, the Telefolmin village normally consists of a complex of men's houses at one end of the village space with family houses com- pleting a circle or ranged in two rows facing inwards on the dancing area which is always devoid of grass. The head of the space, opposite the complex of men's houses, is usually occupied by the family house containing the most important ancestral bones. All these houses are eligible for a houseboard. The menstruation hut is situated outside the village a short distance off. Latrines (a recent institution) are similarly placed outside the village. The houseboard (Plate 2b) is a boat-shaped plank of about nine feet in length, two feet in width and two inches thick. At its lower end is a hole about 2 feet 6 inches high and I foot 8 inches wide which serves as the doorway. The area above the hole is covered with an incised design and painted in black, red, white and occasionally yellow. During, or after, construction of the house, the board is fastened over the doorway so that the doorway and the board-hole coincide. The board has no structural purpose and appears to be purely decorative. 4-M.</page><page sequence="3">262 BARRY CRAIG Manufacture I. Technique.' A softwood tree of suitable size is selected and felled. As a result of its fall it may happily split lengthwise. If so the arisan chops out a length of log and completes the split. If not, he must split it with wedges. He then chops away at the convex side of the half-log until he has a rough plank about nine feet long and two feet wide. This is carefully smoothed and shaped and the hole cut out at the lower end. Traditionally, stone adzes were used and the amotmt of labour expended must have been enormous. Nowadays, of course, steel axes are used. Table i demonstrates that the period of transition from stone to steel took place during the first half of the I940's. The earliest record for the use of steel is I940 and for the latest use of stone is 1944. The arrival of a large Australian-American work force to build an airstrip at Telefomin in I944 ended the general use of stone adzes, for steel axes were given as payment for labour on the airstrip.

This may take some weeks. When dry, the design is marked out on the board with charcoal. All the areas not covered with the black lines are then chiselled out to a depth of about i in., leaving a raised pattern which is later re-painted black.2 The chiselling was once done with the stone adze and small hand-held flakes and blades. Cassowary bone gouges were also sometimes used in the manner of a chisel, the wood being broken out splinter by splinter. Steel knives are used today. Four colours are commonly used: red ochre, yellow ochre, black and white. The red is obtained from two sources. The first is a red clay found at Ulapmin. It may be purchased by trade. When required for use it is broken off from a lump and applied with a little moisture by rubbing into the surface to be painted with the forefinger. The second source3 is a red iron deposit found in water seepages, this being an iron compound associated with micro-organisms. The deposit is scraped up and taken home, the water is squeezed out and the deposit is placed on a sheet of</page><page sequence="4">HOUSEBOARDS OF THE TELEFOMIN SUB-DISTRICT 263 bark, or directly on the hot coals. When it is thoroughly baked into a hard lump it is removed from the fire with tongs. For use, it is crushed to a powder and applied without water. The Ulapmin ochre is called bakan and the seepage deposit is called inalol. The latter term has now been applied to rust on iron implements. The former term is the general term for 'ground' and all kinds of 'paint'. Yellow ochre is a clay found locally. White paint (bakun) is a chalky substance also found locally. Neither requires special processing. Black paint (amsaling) is ob- tained by mixing soot, found on the underside of house roofs, with water or saliva. The design in relief is always painted black, and other parts of the design are painted according to the inspiration of the artisan. The colours themselves were said to have no particular significance. 2. Artisan. Not every man in the community is sufficiently talented or sufficiently motivated to manufacture a houseboard, and fewer are sufficiently talented to execute a symmetrical and aesthetically-pleasing design. There is, then, a tendency towards specialisation. During the period i96o-5, there were seventeen artisans involved in the manufacture of eleven Kialikmin4 houseboards, and eighty adult males in the work force. 2I per cent. of the work force therefore participated in the manufacture of houseboards in I96o-5. Table 2 further explores this tendency towards specialisation. Each of the four tasks or processes involved in the manu- facture of a houseboard is called a 'unit of work'. By carrying out each of the four processes himself, an artisan scores four units of work. Should two men share each task or process, they score half a unit each at each task, making two units each. In this sample, only eleven of the thirty-five houseboards were manufactured by a single artisan at each of the four stages of manufacture, and in only eight cases was this the one artisan throughout.

Table 2 indicates that an artisan nor- mally participates in the manufacture of only one houseboard; however there was a case of an artisan involved in the manufacture of six houseboards and there is reason to believe that he could add to this number. Of the tasks involved, design turns out to be the most specialised: for only thirty-two persons were involved in it as compared to the less specialised task of transport, where forty-eight persons were involved. Three men scored more than two units of work in each process (table 2B). Ebielapnok scored highest in each task. He is known throughout the area as an artisan and craftsman of outstanding skill, as also are Dabalgal and Domolokim. These men have recently turned their skills to work for the tourist trade and are manufacturing warshields of reduced size bearing the traditional designs common to both shields and houseboards. These sell at between five and eight dollars (Aust.), depending upon their quality and the generosity of the purchaser. Should any person other than the owner, joint owner, or a very close relative, take part in the manufacture of a houseboard, ideally he must be paid. Payment is normally in the form of food to sustain the artisan(s) during manufacture, or a gift of pork after completion of the board. Of the thirty-five houseboards sampled, only 29 per cent. had been paid for, though some payments were pending. The persons receiving pork could not be classed as any particular kind of relative, distant or close. However, six of the seven donors of pork were of kamokim ('big man') status, or were aspiring to this status. (The sole exception was a case where the owner took no part in the manufacture of the board and was clearly obliged to pay for its manufacture.) This behaviour accords with the custom of sustaining with meals those who assist one to build one's house, and with the practice of providing a substantial meal upon completion of the project. Distributing pork provides an opportunity for a man to further his kamokim status, and whilst every opportunity may not in fact be taken, it often is. Table 3 shows which relatives assist a man to manufacture a houseboard. For this table, ego is the owner. Three important results emerge. First, there are no cases where a senior relative of ego (in terms of kinship, not age) assisted in the manu- facture of his houseboard. For example ZS has appeared in a workgroup for MB (ego), but never has MB appeared in awork group for ZS (ego). Second, affmal and cognatic relationships are of equal significance. Third, the Telefolmin say that 'one s brother-in-law is as one's brother', and together they account for half the relationships activated for the manufacture of houseboards. Table 4 examines the age at which most manufacturing takes place. 'Artisan participation' denotes each instance where an individual participated in any or all of the stages of the production of a houseboard. It was found that results for Derol- engdam village differed greatly from those for Angkevip village. The reasons for this are not clear. It would appear that the period of greatest productivity is between the ages of twenty and forty. However, as some of the houseboards of older men are by now non-existent, and as there are more persons in the under-forty category than in the over-forty category, it is impossible to check reliably whether or not this is generally true.</page><page sequence="6">HOUSEBOARDS OF THE TELEFOMIN SUB-DISTRICT 265 TABLE 3.

Ownership. Although several men may live in the one house and own it jointly by virtue of having co-operated in its construction, they do not auto- matically become joint owners of a houseboard attached to the house. Only if they have inherited it jointly, jointly manufactured it, or jointly commissioned its manufacture, can they be considered joint owners. A woman may become owner of a houseboard by gift or by inheritance. The board is regarded as hers and although she may allow her husband to assume ownership and right of disposal, this is only by grace and at any time she could assert full rights of ownership should she so desire. In respect of rights to this and other types of property (shell money, pigs, etc.), Telefolmin woman's status is not unlike that of a woman's status in our own society. Inheritance of houseboards is generally by males. Sons were the recipients in four cases out of nine; cognates were the recipients in six cases out of nine, the remainder being affines, two of whom acquired ownership through the widows of the original owners. The widows still retain residual interest, and reside in the house to which the boards are attached. Effective ownership, however, has been taken over by a sister's husband in one case and by a brother in the other. What is most important in every case of inheritance is that the houseboard remains on the house of the deceased and is inherited by the senior occupant. This is usually, but not necessarily, a son; but he is seldom the eldest, for the latter has usually estab- lished an independent household before his father's death. Designs I. Design types. Careful study of the eighty houseboard designs recorded from all Telefolmin villages but one (including a few boards which were destroyed before May I965, or purchased by museums) yields a spectrum of designs (fig. 2) within which I have identified eleven sub-types. These eleven sub-types I have grouped into five relatively dictinct types, with a sixth group of four boards unclassified. Each of the eighty designs was placed in one of the six categories and the distri- bution of these designs was examined according to local groupings (parish and village), kin groups, and year of manufacture. These and other designs are to be found also on warshields5 throughout the area-the Mianmin to the north, the Biniin and Oksapmin to the east, the Fai- wolmin to the south, the Wopkeimin, Tifalmin and Atbalmin to the west (see map). Evidence for the spread of the designs to as far north as Green River is presented by the photograph of a war shield opposite page 8o in Buhler et al. (I962). However, houseboards are known only to exist among the Telefolmin, their two sub-tribes the Falamin and Eliptaman kasel, the Urapmin, and in com- bination with other carved boards to make up a complete decorative fa9ade, among the Faiwolmin, Wopkeimin and Tifalrnin. Decorative facades without a house- board are to be found among the Oksapniin and Wopkeimin. Similar design elements are to be found throughout the entire Mountain Ok area,6 on house- boards, faqades and shields. 2. Mythology. Whilst Afek,7 the original ancestress, was at Telefolip, the sun was taking an active part in building up the culture of the Telefolmin. The sun lived at the top of the pine trees at Telefolip. He saw that there were no spider webs in the cordyline plants and felt there should be, so he caused it to be so. Then he</page><page sequence="8">HOUSEBOARDS OF THE TELEFOMIN SUB-DISTRICT 267 Type A (24) Type B (17) 4 1 8 2492 2 Type C (5) Type D ( 6) Type E (14) Type No. &gt; &lt; A ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~24 B 17 5 D 16 Iz~~~~~~ Other 4 14 Total 80 &gt;5&lt; FIGURE 2.

Then he took a particular type of arrow (dili) and instructed the men to paint it red and white and to use it in warfare. He also made a war shield which was thereafter kept in the telefolip (the central 'mother-house' of the Telefolmin at the village of that name) but was destroyed when the Iligimin burnt down the house about i875. The design on this shield was said to be the one classified as type A. Previously the Telefolmin had no houseboards either, so the sun threw down a prototype of the design for a houseboard (again said to be of type A). Thus the sun added less functional but more aesthetic ideas to the basic culture established by Afek. The sun originated the ideas, defined their function and meaning, and laid down who was to be associated with them. 3. Meaning of the designs. When first asked about the meaning of the designs on houseboards and war shields, informants declared that they were meaningless. Over a period of two years the same response was obtained. Then one day an informant volunteered meanings. The break-through was apparently achieved by a slight alteration in the question asked: from 'What does this design mean?' to 'What does this part of the design mean?' The design, as a whole, has no meaning for the Telefolmin. However, the elements do. Informants tended to agree on the meanings of elements but there were variations. The impression gained is that the original meanings have been lost and perhaps the design too has changed from a more naturalistic original. The present-day meanings are therefore most probably piecemeal rationalisations, though they hint at an anthropomorphic original. The more common meanings given to the elements are set out in figure 3. In figure 4, I postulate a possible development of the present type A from a human figure.</page><page sequence="9">268 BARRY CRAIG tracks of a snake . cockatoo's beak cassowary's beak tracks of a snake vagina, lizard's liver, conus shell, moon (Urapmin)* man's belly, spider's abdomen, umbilicus (Mianmin) fore- or hind-leg of a crocodile, forearm of a man conus shell {T3rTT feet of crocodile _ \ 4 tail-feather of a bird of paradise, mark made by wood borer, Mianmin: man's eye mark made by wood borer, j&lt; &lt; {cooked taro grub flying fox or bat hanging upside down hawk's wing - &gt; -cassowary's, or other, head, with eyes * Information on Urapmin meaning from B.

This may be due largely, however, to the probability that Angkevip replaced houseboards of design B with houseboards of design A earlier than did Derolengdam. The shift is apparent by comparison of Kialikmin I962 and Kialikmin I965 villages. There does not appear, then, to be any consistent relation- ship between houseboard designs and local groupings. (b) According to kin groups (Kialikmin parish only): the kin groups were defined partly according to cognatic descent and partly with reference to group alliances during disputes and the like.8 Distribution seemed somewhat random and there did not appear to be any relationship between design type and kin group. (c) According to period of manufacture: the date of manufacture of each Kialik- min houseboard was ascertained by reference to six major historical events involving European contact with the Telefolnuin: I9I4 (Thurnwald expedition); I927 (Karius and Champion); 1936 (Williams, Campbell and others); I944 (Australian- American force landed in gliders to rehabilitate the Campbell airstrip); I948 (administrative patrol post set up); I953 (two patrol officers and two native con- stables killed by the Telefolmin). Table i indicates clearly that the designs for the Kialikmin parish are discretely clustered through time, with but two exceptions. It would appear that a generation of artisans adheres to one design type, each generation choosing a different type. However, I hesitate to claim this pheno- menon for other villages and parishes without further research. The consistency of the design over various periods in time may be partly related to the fact that villages change their site every fifteen to twenty years. Many of the houses and houseboards will have deteriorated to such an extent that their replace- ment is considered. Thus we find several houses in a village requiring a new houseboard at about the same time, and the likelihood that all of these may be of one design is greatly enhanced. When Derolengdam split into two newly-situated villages in i964-5, the Dalduvip sector replaced all the houseboards on the family houses with five new ones of design A. The only other board was an old one of design E which was retained on the rebuilt men's house.</page><page sequence="12">HOUSEBOARDS OF THE TELEFOMIN SUB-DISTRICT 27I Conclusion As mentioned earlier, the designs on war shields, faqades and houseboards out- side the Telefolmin area are closely related to those found among the Telefolmin. The uniformity of the design elements, of the artefacts themselves, and of the techniques involved in their manufacture, favours distinguishing the Mountain Ok area as a style province separate from any others previously described. However, the northern and southern boundaries of this style province are not yet ascertained. Affinities are apparent between Mountain Ok art styles and those of the upper Sepik, to the north. However, it would appear that these represent a merging of styles at the boundary common to the two areas rather than a hint of common origins. Further research is needed here. In general, Mountain Ok culture is oriented south rather than north-to the Fly-Digul basins rather than to the Sepik (Craig I966). Parallels between Mountain Ok and Papuan Gulf art styles seem to exist and suggest common origins. Newton thinks of the mouth of the Fly River as being the 'junction for Southwestern New Guinea, the Torres Straits, and the Gulf through which passed and were disseminated numerous ceremonial and artistic forms' (I96I: 9). In the light of this statement, relationships between the two areas no longer seem coincidental. Extensive trade takes place between the Telefolmin and their neighbours to the south. The presence at Telefomin of a number of steel axes of Dutch or German origin, said to have been traded in from the south, is sufficient evidence for the mechanism being operative to at least as far south as Tanahmerah, possibly even to Merauke near the coast. This is not surprising, for Dr Alan Healey has estab- lished (I964) that the Ok family of languages, some ten to fifteen languages spoken by about 5o,ooo people, of which the Telefolmin language is a member, extends to the tribes in south New Guinea speaking the Marind-Kuni family of languages. Wirz, in his book on the Marind-anim (I922, i925)9 includes a description of carved and painted boards which are fastened above the doorways of houses. He gives illustrations which demonstrate the remarkable similarity between the art styles of the Marind-anim and the Telefolmin. There can be little doubt that the influence has been direct. Other similarities between artefacts from both areas support this. It is interesting that houseboards occur only among the most sedentary of Mountain Ok tribes. It could be argued that, like the people of the Central High- lands (Bulmer &amp; Bulmer I964; Robbins I963; Watson i965; White i965), the earlier inhabitants of Ifitaman were locally semi-nomadic and have adopted a sedentary mode of existence only within the past three hundred years or so. Whereas facades on ceremonial houses at permanent ritual centres (as among the Wopkeimin) are not inconsistent with a semi-nomadic mode of life, houseboards on individual family houses almost certainly are. It appears then that (a) faqades may be an earlier art-form than houseboards and (b) there being some evidence for links between Marind-anim and Mountain Ok cultures, the Telefolmnin house- boards may be a recent indigenous refinement of an earlier Marind-anim art form. NOTES This study was carried out in conjunction with an ethnographical collection made for the Australian Museum whilst the author was an education officer at the Primary 'T' School at</page><page sequence="13">272 BARRY CRAIG Telefomin. The Museum trustees provided finance for the purchase of three hundred items, including three houseboards. Further data were obtained during the Australian Star Mountains Expedition in February-May I965. I should like to thank Mr B. A. L. Cranstone, Mr R. Wright and Dr J. A. W. Forge for their invaluable comments and suggestions during the preparation of this article. I I myself have not observed every stage of the manufacture of a houseboard. I have seen the boards drying out after shaping and have observed the application of paint. I have had the method of executing the design demonstrated on a small plank; however, my wife has observed this latter process carried out on a houseboard. The process of splitting the log and of cutting and shaping the board is described as reported to me, I believe, reliably. 2 The facade of a house seen in the Oksapmin area, to the east, and a shield (British Museum, no. I964 Oc. 3.435) supposed to have come from the Bimin Valley (also in the Oksapmin area) show definite indications that charring has been used as a technique for arriving at a black surface either prior to, or after, design-cutting. Such a technique would result in rapid deter- ioration of relief as is indeed the case with the Bimin shield. It is interesting that this technique is in use among the Papuan Gulf tribes (Newton I96I: 29). 3 Dr A. Healey, Summer Institute of Linguistics: personal communication. 4 Kialikmin is one of several Telefohnin 'parishes'. The parish comprises a number of centrally-based villages, together with hamlets scattered over non-contiguous gardening and hunting territories. Membership of the parish is defined in the context of cognatic descent. Detailed data were obtained only for the 35 Kialikmin houseboards. The wider sample of 8o boards was examined only for village and parish determinants of design distribution. 5 Cranstone (I965: II7) has dispelled the confusion (Kooijman I962: 32, footnote 6I) be- tween warshields and houseboards brought about by Simpson's assertion (I954: 222) that warshields do not exist among the Telefolmin. Campbell (I938: 249, 250, 253) was quite clear in his report on the distinction between, and the existence of, both objects. 6 Dr A. Healey has identified the Ok family of languages and divided it into Mountain and Lowland Ok sub-families. Mountain Ok is spoken by those tribes outlined in figure i, ex- cluding the Oksapmin and Om tribes, with Sibil in doubt as perhaps a third Ok sub-family. Oksapmin and Om tribes speak languages of another family or families. However, I propose to accept their culture as common to that of the Mountain Ok and to use the latter term to refer to this common culture. 7 The account of the Afek myth given to myself and my wife differed little in essentials from that reported by Quinlaven (I954) but exceeded it in scope. This is part of the expansion. 8 My wife's assistance is acknowledged for help with the allocation of individuals to kin groups and with kinship data obtained during her fieldwork I962-65. 9 Cf. Biihler et al. (I962: II2) . Evidence for the decorative fa,ade among the Marind-anim is presented in part 3 of Wirz's comprehensive study in which p. i8o gives a description of carved and painted boards over doorways. Figure 2I gives drawings of some boards. Further evidence of boards and faqades in the area is presented by the photograph on p. I I4 in van de Kolk (I919) and by plate i in Fuhrmann (I922). Another interesting cultural link is the hair appendage (Fuhrmann, pl. 7) which is almost identical with the Telefolmin mafum. The spatulate palmwood club (Telefolmin: bial-sanam), with an incised design part-way down the blade, is spread throughout the whole southern area of New Guinea, as are the various stone- headed clubs (Telefolmin: tingi).
