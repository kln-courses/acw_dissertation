<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aesthetics and Judaism, Art and Revelation Zachary Braiterman Aesthetic sensation (sight, sound, taste, smell, and touch) and aesthetic creation (architecture, music, poetry, painting) are at the base of reli- gious thought and culture. In rabbinic memory, the Temple in Jerusalem was once the "adornment (noyo) of the world" (Zebahim 54b), its altar compared to a wolf (53b), its sanctuary to a lion, narrow behind and broad in front (Middot 4:7). Religious environments build upon a mass of physical stuff: objects and texts, stories and sound, organized and re- organized by acts of custom and law. Empirically, the co-relation be- tween aesthetics and religion is the self-evident subject of art history and the history of religions, its existence, if not its significance, a matter of fact. At a second order of analysis, the relationship proves cryptic. The religious culture of Judaism depends upon the presupposition that the presence of God, the glory of God, is made manifest to human consciousness through visual, aural, and tactile media. Such a theoreti- cally fraught claim and the counterclaims against it are of unique con- cern to theological speculation and philosophical analysis. They relay human consciousness past the limits of reason into the dim vagaries of aesthetic judgment and religious intuition, into Plato's cave, the holy of holies. Unable to strip God's revelation from human sensation, the Hebrew Bible will have brought them to bear upon each other. The divine pre- sence descends in thunder, lightning, and thick cloud; its law an acoustic imperative played out by the voice of a horn waxing louder and louder (Ex. 19). Moses later warns the people, "And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire; you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only a voice . . . Take you therefore good heed unto yourselves, for you saw no manner of form on the day that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire" (Deut. 4:12,15). For their part, the people make out no visible form since all they saw was thundering (Ex. 20:15). God told Moses, "For men shall not see me and live" Jewish Studies Quarterly, Volume 1 1 (2004) pp. 366-385 © Mohr Siebeck - ISSN 0944-5706</page><page sequence="2">(2004) Aesthetics and Judaism, Art and Revelation 367 (Ex. 33:20). But Moses, Aaron, and the elders saw something. They "saw the God of Israel; there was under his feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness" (Ex. 24:9-10). And so too the prophet Isaiah said, "I saw YHWH sitting on a throne, high and lifted up" (Isa. 6:1). As for the signal difference between what the prophets and Moses were able to see, the rabbis ex- plain, "Ί saw YHWÎP [is to be understood] in accordance with what was taught: All the prophets looked into a dim glass, but Moses looked through a clear glass" (Yevamot 49b). Already showing discomfort with the gross anthropomorphism found in Hebrew Scriptures, the thought behind this rabbinic utterance draws attention away from the figure of God, the content of divine revelation, towards optic media. The recent study of aesthetics and religion occurs at two unique his- torical junctures: the burgeoning of art as a separate field of philosophi- cal inquiry in Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment German philoso- phy and the impact upon religion by the modern critique of metaphysics and postmodern semiotics. A robust skepticism strains any traditional or post-traditional trust placed in art and in language: the ability to manifest in time and space a piece of the Infinite or Absolute, an elusive presence, the call of Being, the face of the Other. Such is the wooly trust animating Hamann and Herder in the eighteenth century, the early ro- mantics and Hegel in the nineteenth, Heideggerian poetics and Levina- sian ethical gesture in the twentieth. It flies flat in the face of Platonic metaphysics, as well as enlightened French materialism, Kantian reason, art for the sake of art, High Modernist criticism, and the cynical side of postmodern play. The better part of reason rightly insists that the phy- sical status of art objects and art-acts reveal purely material and formal properties, but the lesser part of reason has always left the imagination loose. Our own postmodernism combines a hermeneutic of suspicion and a hermeneutic of charity to claims regarding reason, the imagina- tion, and religious reality. In style, the sympathies are more rabbinic than biblical, oblique and indirect, rattling back and forth between gul- libility and skepticism. As Walter Benjamin recommends in his study on The Origin of the German Tragic Drama, it is art, not philosophy, that will unlock the "methodological element in philosophical projects [that] is not simply part of their didactic mechanism."1 Revelation and "the spiritual in art" extend the theoretical interface between objects and concepts 1 Walter Benjamin, The Origin of the German Tragic Drama, translated by John Osborne, (London: Verso, 1998), 27.</page><page sequence="3">368 Zachary Braiterman JSQ 1 1 broached by Kant in the critique of pure reason. "Without sensibility," he wrote, "no object would given to us, without understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions with- out concepts are blind."2 In this ambiguous circularity, sense perception requires the organizing capacity of concepts and categories that shape it into knowable patterns. Otherwise the subject cannot see. But the clarity to apprehend any object of possible experience relies upon the dim sense-impression without which thought is vacuous. A curious combina- tion of sight and sound, the intensity of the divine appearance as under- stood in the history of religion stands inside and outside all such cate- gories and intuition. It belongs to a discourse that after Kant finds itself caught in the middle between the competing rigors of reason, everyday ethics, and the glory of sensation. An alternative approach to the circularity observed by Kant runs against his own transcendental method, a system in which thought works to establish the apriori intellectual conditions upon which possi- ble experience is based. Methodologically, neither reason nor revelation escapes the co-priority that regulates the overlap between aesthetics, ethics, and pure cognition. Eschewing logical priority and axiological privilege, this co-priority plots the spatial position of one plane next to the other. In radical isolation, attention to any single field of conscious- ness may precede attention to the others in time without, however, re- ducing them to its own organizational preconditions. Any asymmetry elevating one over the other is at most pragmatic since each field subsists at the same instance, despite the interlude it takes to register one after the other in the time it takes to think one thought after the other. The principle of co-priority identifies a system of simultaneity precluding any single root of knowledge or source of value in either reason or sensation. Not even God enjoys unambiguous priority. As the rabbis teach, "Six things preceded the creation of the world, some of them were actually created, while the creation of the others was already con- templated." Torah, the Throne of Glory, the creation of the patriarchs, the creation of Israel, the creation of the Temple, and the name of Mes- siah pre-exist with the divine before creation. But one cannot think everything at once. R. Ahabah b. R. Zeeira adds repentance to the list as an ethical afterthought (Genesis Rabbah 1:4). 2 Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, translated by Norman Kemp Smith, (New York: St.Martin's Press, 1929), 93.</page><page sequence="4">(2004) Aesthetics and Judaism, Art and Revelation 369 Aesthetics, Religion, and "The Spiritual in Art" After Kant, aesthetic activity occupies the most rarified or the crudest philosophical activity: either the narrow study of art, its ethereal figures and attendant genres, or gross sense impression and sensuality. Our own view is that aesthetics marks the midpoint of theoretical consciousness, that which Alexander Baumgarten, defining the term towards the start of the eighteenth century, had earlier called "the science of perception." The ordering of jumbled representations into sensible patterns that are neither "obscure" nor "distinct," as Terry Eagleton remarks, aesthetics lacks the rigor of scientific logic and the confused nature of unfiltered sense perception. A middle figure, it hovers between the rational and the sensual, the ideal and the real.3 In their relation to the imagination, aesthetics and art share the zone typically occupied by religion, revela- tion, miracle, and wonder. Baumgarten opined, "We agree with Des- cartes, who regards wonder as 'a sudden seizure of the soul, in that it is lifted into a rapt consideration of objects which seem to it rare and extraordinary.'" He went on to say, "[I]n the extraordinary we sense, rather than implicitly assert, a relation to the inconceivable."4 Calling into question the very idea that revelation and art constitute radically autonomous fields, Mark Taylor has more recently brought critical attention to the mediating figure - the form carved out and covered up by image, act, or word - at the center of both. As the sensate figure of revelation, religion is a composition composed of "natural" and "supranatural" elements, the figure and the unfigurable that resists figuration.5 The circles, triangles, and squares at the base of aesthetic composition are intermediary beings. Like angels and saints, they belong neither to the world of pure appearance nor to the world of pure non- being. Ideal, dogmatic content does not exhaust religion. Rather, reli- gion is the physically mundane place between a daemon and its people alongside the symbolic relation that is always already drenched by the "art" that has lent them shape and sound. As a composition, Judaism is neither static nor dynamic. The graphic, verbal, and gestural images at play across the surface of its system grow more or less stable at any one geographical place and historical moment. Continually re-configured by collective and individual actors in response to local conditions, they 3 Terry Eagleton, ideology of the Aesthetic, (Cambridge: Basil Blackwell, 1990), 16. 4 Alexander Baumgarten, Reflections on Poetry, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1954), section 43. 5 Mark C.

Kitsch - defined by Clement Greenberg as mechanical, formulaic, ersatz culture, as vicarious experience and faked sensation - is unavoid- able at the juncture between religion and art, but the problem that dogs the boundary separating the relatively isolate art-object and art-act from religion is two-fold.6 In certain "theologies of culture," no sign or style, no matter how secular, is made to lack spiritual significance. With no regard to the material difference between religion and the practice of art, a painting by Cézanne or by Picasso is reduced to a pre-given, religious point of reference.7 On the other hand, religion is just as likely to be reduced to aesthetic values in modern art discourse, typically at the ex- pense of its daily practice and moral expression. The substantive differ- ence between religion and art demands a provisional measure of auton- omy vis-à-vis each field. Religion has its share in art, but also in that which is not art, in that type of form that is indifferent to form. Art has its share in religion, but also in that which is not religious representa- tion. Marked not by a fixed and firm border, but by an obscure and floating line, the two planes of art and religion are virtually identical in their appeal to the power of imagination. A functional virtuality, it re- sists proclivities to invest every human expression with spiritual signifi- cance or to see art in everything and everything as art. Analytically, religion is not art and art is not religion, even if in the historical culture of their production prior to the eighteenth century it is finally impossible to think one before the other. "Aesthetics" is that intentional act which sustains contemplation of sense impression, including art and the impromptu appearance of that which is not art. The more one looks to the sensual constitution of any object or group of objects, the more aesthetic the attention. The distinc- tion between art and non-art is the physical form of compressed sensa- tion that defines the former for as long as it continues to subsist in time and space. It is a condensed character that strains against the ad hoc conditions of everyday sensation represented by realist and Impressio- nists and then performed in Cubism, Dada, photomontage, pop-art, and 6 Clement Greenberg, "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" in Art and Culture: Critical Es- says, (Boston: Beacon Press, 1961), 10. 7 See especially, Paul Tillich, "Aspects of a Religious Analysis of Culture," "The Nature of Religious Language" and "Protestantism and Artistic Style" in Theology of Culture, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964).

The artwork is a "superformation," an altered state under which, as Buber understood, the "whole optical, the whole acoustical field becomes refashioned ever anew."8 Insofar as sustained attention to sensation enters into it, Judaism, a form of non-art, is aesthetic with- out being art; yet the more it relies upon the intentional creation of specialized spatial environments, sonic patterns, and literary sign-sys- tems, the more it resembles art in its material make-up. In contrast, the "spiritual in art" stands for that "possibility of seeing in the object ... something less physical than the object itself, which in an age of realism one sought merely to represent 'as it is,' with 'no nonsense.'" Refusing to overdraw the difference between the natural and the supranatural, Wassily Kandinsky wondered, "Is it not possible that the distinctions we draw between matter and spirit are merely de- grees of matter or spirit? Thought ... is matter too, but a kind of matter that only fine and not coarse senses can perceive. Is spirit that which the physical hand cannot touch? . . . [It] is sufficient if one avoids drawing over-sharp distinctions."9 In close association with love and death, the spiritual in art can be compared to a filament in aesthetic sensation and artistic formation cued by gold leaf and extended notes, empty volumes and the interval between noise and silence. Tending towards the non- material, verging upon the preposterous, it points art past its own purely physical dimension. Not exhausted by strictly formal criteria of material and method, it occupies that opaque and vulnerable joint where art juts up against the in-credible language and literature of cult and revelation. Image /Word Confounding any final division of the arts according to a strict tempor- al-spatial axis, the spiritual in modern art is planted into space, time, and the language of color. In the history of western aesthetic theory, painting was long thought to constitute an essentially mimetic art, a copy-realism, threatening to infect the free range of poetic expression. Lessing, who was the first to draw this distinction, retained a deep un- certainty about the visual arts. Their ability to copy works only too well. Painting and sculpture must not allow one to freeze the expression of suffering for all perpetuity into a repulsive, static image. Lessing's model 8 Martin Buber, The Knowledge of Man: A Philosophy of the Interhuman, (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965), 162, 164. 9 Wassily Kandinsky, Complete Writings on Art, (New York: Da Capo Press, 1994), 138.</page><page sequence="7">372 Zachary Braiterman JSQ 1 1 was the classical image of the ill-fated Laocoon and his two sons en- coiled by three fearsome sea-serpents at the gates of Troy. Fixed in time, the image would never move past the instance of disfiguration. At the same time, the plastic arts were thought to have no relation to the invisible, reducing the superhuman to human size, the gods to god- like people. They limit perception to the visible, to beauty and to the body. And even here, painting depends upon inert physical appearance, not character and charm, defined by the author as beauty in motion. Painting was thus either too ghastly or too pale. The eighteenth century critic was unable to imagine plastic art without reference to physical bodies, paintings in accord with Klee whose creators sought, not to reproduce the visible, but to make the invisible visible.10 The spatial arts, Lessing ruled, "should express nothing essentially transitory. All phenomena, whose nature it is suddenly to break out and as suddenly to disappear, which can remain as they are but for a moment; all such phenomena, whether agreeable or otherwise, acquire through the perpetuity conferred upon them by art such an unnatural impression ... till the whole subject at least wearies or disgusts us."11 It is the unnatural suddenness and fleeting presence that describes precisely the power of the image and the force of revelation. The face of God is rendered up-close and visible, the prophet's mouth is rent asunder, the earth shudders, cities topple. Everything screams or falls silent all at once. Poet Georg Heym envied painters. "Why have the heavens refused me the talent for drawing?" he complained. "Images torment me as never a painter before me." Heym wanted in poetry that optical effect by which images appear next to and within each other. Standing Les- sing' s axiological schema upside down, Expressionist poetry took to things simultaneously, one thing beside the next (nebeneinander), not one thing following the other (nacheinander) in narrative sequence.12 Marked affinities between perceptual, conceptual, verbal, and graphic signs define the twentieth century modernism in such a way as to jumble 10 Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Laocoon: An Essay upon the Limits of Painting and Poetry, translated by Ellen Frothingham, (New York: The Noonday Press, 1957). Made to suit the rules of classical sculpture and poetry that he himself invented, the inter- pretation hardly squares with the image itself. Unlike the pathos-laden account by Sophocles, the sculpture was not allowed by Lessing to convey suffering. He found in it only the stoic heroism of a steady, composed, and serene soul. 11 Ibid., 17. 12 Georg Heym, Dichtungen und Schriften, vol.3, (Verlag Heinrich Eilermann, 1960), 159, 140.

According to Heinz Rölleke, this uniquely expressionistic style is more easily accomplished in paint- ing than in poetry.</page><page sequence="8">(2004) Aesthetics and Judaism, Art and Revelation 373 neo-classical aesthetic canons. As W. J. T. Mitchell has come to argue, the difference separating poetry and painting does not fall into strict binaries between time/space, invisible/visible, culture/nature, mediate/im- mediate. Visual sensation is no more naturally self-evident and no less conventionally mediated, and no less committed to the invisible than poetic form. The relation between verbal and graphic image is symbio- tic. From Plato's cave to Freud's interpretation of dreams, the verbal conventions provided by narrative and theory are required to create, identify, and make sense of visual images; just as visual cues are indis- pensable to the work of thought. Epistemologically, Mitchell's call for a "renewed respect for the eloquence of images and ... a renewed faith in the perspicuousness of language" thus falls upon the insight that we cannot apprehend truth, goodness, and beauty apart from the interplay of graphic and verbal image.13 Art historian Wendy Steiner has traced the radical division between image and word back to the early Renaissance when painters abandoned the narrative sequence conveyed by multi-episodic picture planes. Single point perspective and the illusion of pictorial depth were used to mimic the optical image organized by the eye at any single moment of appre- hension. It was the re-introduction of language into Cubist painting that finally upends the mimetic tradition. Similar arguments have been ad- vanced to interpret Klee's work. In Villa R (pl. I), the temporal and invisible form of language, somewhat at a loss, somewhat brazenly, en- ters into the silence of pictorial space. Like all writing, the letter "R" is both a verbal and a graphic mark, a piece of linguistic code that clearly does not belong to the landscape's order and dimension. Its presence there, the presence of language in painting, is awkward, suggesting that there is no relation to the visible world apart from the intrusive verbal bit with which someone has already given it shape.14 A religiously neutral scene, Villa R reveals no new angel with which to plumb the relation between religion and art. Any relation to religion and post-religious romantic thought is ironic and indirect. It rests in a ten- uous relation to the physical world. As Marcel Franciscono comments, the curtain-like framing at the upper corners undermines any strict re- 13 W. J. T.

That is, if the large green "R" belongs to that world, the fit remains uncomfortable. The linguistic sign protrudes up against the flattened architectural space beneath a theatrically cast, moonlit mountain scene. Impossible to read on its own, the mark is at once audible and inaudible. It disrupts the perspec- tivai depth that the red path leading into the distance might have other- wise indicated. The architectural structure has flattened to form a con- struct composed of squares, rectangles, triangles, and cross-like sections. In Villa R, the spiritual in art, plays like a revelation between two dis- parate dimensions: organic and geometric, real and theatrically make- believe, inhuman and human, the visible landscape and the invisible presence of language rendered visible. Physical and spiritual elements, image and word, are made to intermingle in what had once been firm, pictorial space.15 Jewish ? Theoretical statements about art in Judaism, the original place of revela- tion, have most often privileged word over image in the very manner faulted by Mitchell. As polemically expressed by Hermann Cohen in the Religion of Reason, an abiding monument to nineteenth century canons of liberal Judaism and German Idealism, plastic art constitutes nothing less than "image worship." "/"/// is the proof of the true God that there can be no image of Him. He can never be known through a likeness, but simply and solely as archetype, as archetypal thought, as archetypal being."16 Ideas vault above empirical reality. It therefore did not matter if idolaters worship the phenomena represented by the image, not the image itself since monotheism rejects the worship of any object. God's uniqueness lies in the divine ideality outstripping every real thing, pro- cess, and mimetic art. Plastic art cannot even capture the human figure, much less God, who bears no image. The ideal art of monotheism is the lyric poetry of the psalms. It "makes shame the last recourse for the idol worshipper." Poetry couples God and man into a lively connection, whereas plastic art restricts itself poorly to one or the other in fixed isolation.17 Standing on weak art-historical and hermeneutical feet, such philo- sophical pieties collapse before the flora, fauna, and human image in the 15 Marcel Franciscono, Paul Klee: His Work and Thought, 182^1. 16 Hermann Cohen, Religion of Reason, 57 (emphasis in the original). 17 Ibid.</page><page sequence="10">(2004) Aesthetics and Judaism, Art and Revelation 375 ancient synagogue art at Beit Alpha, Sepporis, and Dura Europas, or in medieval, renaissance and baroque Haggadah illustration, and in the decoration of East European gravestones and synagogues. Outside the context of worship, there is no Bilderverbot, no prohibition of images. While the second commandment states, "You shall not make for your- self a sculptured image, or any likeness of what is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the earth," it then adds, "You shall not bow down to them or serve them" (Ex. 20:4-5). One can see with art historian Moshe Barasch how only in isolation, the first verse entails a comprehensive restriction banning all figures. The second verse, however, limits the restriction. Viewed as a whole, the text bans only the worship of figurative images. Visually myopic, Cohen supported the comprehensive curb with no art-historical or text-critical support.18 The shame cast on visual art belongs more to the influence of Les- sing, the tradition of German Idealism, and to the arts at the/m de siede than to any biblical imperative per se. For Cohen, art was the mimetic representation of visual objects drawn from nature. In the Ästhetik des 18 Moshe Barasch, Icon: studies in the history of an idea, (New York: New York University Press, 1992), chapter 1. Recent work in Jewish Studies regarding visual experience in rabbinic and medieval Jewish thought further undermines Cohen's read- ing of the second commandment.

See especially Moshe Halbertal and Avishai Margalit, Idolatry, translated by Naomi Goldblum, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), 262n.22. Halbertal and Margalit cite an argument between E. R. Goodenough and Ephraim Urbach. According to the former, the example of figurative art in ancient synagogue mosaics and coffins proves that rabbinic law did not determine every aspect of Jewish life in the ancient world. According to the latter, it suggests a permissive attitude within rabbinic culture that took shape during the second and third centuries. This argument entertains the following tension. Simply put, the sources are too ambig- uous to render any sweeping judgments with absolute certainty about the relation between Judaism and figurative art. One finds a comprehensive ban on all images in the early Palestinian Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (commentary to Ex. 20:4) and in the twelfth century responsum of Elyakim b. Joseph of Mainz; the latter cited by Vivian B. Mann, Jewish Texts on the Visual Arts, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 74-5. On the other hand, tractate Avodah Zarah of the Babylonian Talmud and the code of Jewish law, the Shulkhan Arukh are far more permissive. In either case, it is important to note that those authorities who banned the use of all images generally objected to their appearance within the synagogue. In addition to the second commandment, they cited custom, the importance of not distracting worshippers, and the reluctance to follow in the way of gentiles. Those authorities who granted more leeway showed intense opposition to certain cases; for instance, David ibn Zimra's opposition to placing a crowned lion on top of a Torah ark in the synagogue of Cândia in Crete (cited by Mann, 117-20).</page><page sequence="11">376 Zachary Braiterman JSQ 1 1 reinen Gefühls (Aesthetic of Pure Feeling) (1912), he championed Impres- sionism, the avant-garde of his own early years, the optical art par ex- cellence. Submerging individual objects in the limpid succession of everyday phenomena, light becomes its own autonomous object, an op- tic that awakens human persons to their true and natural humanity.19 It was to Cohen the highest form of art in the history of western culture, but went no further than this purest object available to the human eye. This is the art historical context to the Religion of Reason, posthumously published in 1919. Its conception of Judaism, insofar as that conception rests on a critique of art and the rejection of image worship, hangs precariously upon the balance of outmoded aesthetic discourse about representation, which a crop of young artists had already begun to sup- plant. In Expressionism, color is no longer natural. The green letter in Villa R is spiritual and free from objects, even from matter as immaterial as light's motley play upon physical surfaces. Writing from mid-century after the triumph of modernism, a more discerning Steven Schwarzschild allows plastic art into confines hal- lowed by Jewish law and Maimonidean rationalism; although once again, word trumps image in order to contrive a uniquely Jewish ap- proach to visual art. Schwarzschild cites the authoritative code, the Shul- khan eArukh, to explain that Jewish law permits non-mimetic plastic expression. According to a gloss by Moses Isserles (1520-1572), "There are those who hold that images of man or a dragon are not prohibited unless they are complete with all their limbs, but the shape of a head by itself or a body without a head is in no wise forbidden." Schwarzschild relates this opinion back to the medieval rationalist Moses Maimonides, who rejected any attempt to stand for the human soul, God's very im- age. As Schwarzschild puts it, "To represent physical appearance as the whole person is, therefore, a misrepresentation. The converse is also true: a 'misrepresentation' will in fact be a true depiction ... To represent the empirical as tout court is, therefore, also to misrepresent God."20 Deference to the authority of Jewish law notwithstanding, this ap- proach to art, no less than the one propounded by Cohen, trips up on German philosophical idealism. Schwarzschild continues to patrol the anxious boundary separating art form reality, the ideal from the empiri- cal. He wants to avoid that instance in which two objects, the original 19 Hermann Cohen, Ästhetik des reinen Gefühls, vol. II, 404-5.

Schwarzschild cites Shulkhan eArukh, Yoreh De'ah chapter 141.</page><page sequence="12">(2004) Aesthetics and Judaism, Art and Revelation 377 and its artistic reproduction, appear exactly identical. Art is no longer art when the artwork neither adds to nor detracts from the real world. "What in truth is the difference between a pop art duplicate... of a soup can and the original on a display shelf? Hegel was surely right when he held that whenever and wherever the idea is believed to have become identical with the real, the 'death of art' has occurred."21 Couched in the idealist critique of empirical reality and in a modernism already at war with postmodernism, the discussion of the Shulkhan cArukh proudly concludes, "We have thus deduced two of the chief principles of twen- tieth-century modern art - abstraction and distortion."22 Leaving copy- realism far behind, abstract art nihilates physical semblance whereas distortion detracts from and adds to it. Modern art and Judaism thereby confirm each other on the basis of philosophical constructs regarding the fixed difference between appear- ance, representation, and reality. Mostly, the entire exercise remains fun- damentally arbitrary, as seen by Schwarzschild's embrace of Rem- brandt, El Greco, and Modigliani while excluding classical Greek art, its Renaissance revival, French pointillism, and American pop art. The author seems to think that the shadows and light casting the human figure in paintings by Rembrandt's work obviate their realistic character while Warhol's soup cans violate the precious boundary between real and ideal. Spurious at best, such judgment reflects a rearguard modern- ism, not halakhic principle per se. Kandinsky was far less dogmatic in contrast. "Approaching it in one way," the painter wrote, "I see no essen- tial difference between a line one calls 'abstract' and a fish. But an essential likeness." Line and fish are "living beings," each with latent capacities. A "miracle," these capacities are made manifest and radiant by the environment of their composition. And this despite the equally essential difference that a fish "can swim, eat, and be eaten."23 Frozen by theoretical constructs set at particular points in the history of style, Cohen and Schwarzschild have no eye for art as it takes shape in the work of younger contemporaries. The following story is a case in point. In 1860, Moritz Lazarus and Zecharias Fraenkel argued about a memorial statue for the philanthropist Juda Touro. According to the more religiously conservative Fraenkel, the Jews of New Orleans had to disfigure the work for it to fit in the spirit of Jewish law. He was, it seems, unconcerned by the bourgeois canons of refined beauty. Compar- ing this to Picasso, Schwarzschild proudly claims Franekel for the mid 21 Ibid., 115. 22 Ibid., 112. 23 Wassily Kandinsky, Complete Writings on Art, 774-5.</page><page sequence="13">378 Zachary Braiterman JSQ 1 1 twentieth century. He knows that "The 'chaste Athena' which Lazarus admired would be regarded as embarrassingly maudlin today."24 Yet his own hysterical response to pop-art proves no less so. Having brought Jackie, Marilyn, and other "chaste Athenas" back into vogue, pop-art plays with the super-mediated difference between real and fake, not the one between real and ideal. Beholden to styles that were just out of fashion, Schwarzchild and Cohen overlook that which is new or met it with extreme hostility, a reflex that stilts their understanding, not just of art and art history, but also of Judaism in its classical and philosophical expression. With his own attention to the Hebrew t zelem, Mitchell sees fit to comment that the word "image" refers most broadly to a rough idea of likeness, resemblance, and similitude, not to the precise relation of identity feared by Schwarzschild. Art trades in graphic images (pictures, statues, and design) whereas literature employs its own range of verbal images (metaphors and descriptions). Pursued more broadly, perceptual images include sense data and appearances while mental images embrace dreams, memories, ideas, and fantasmata. Mirrors and projections pro- vide another range of refracted optical images.25 In this broader light, Jewish thought and culture extend across a deep range of visual objects, optical stimuli, and ideas about them. Bible, Talmud, and kabbalah con- tinuously trace the movement between holy and profane, inside and out- side, upper and lower, and the sensual stimuli generated by such motion. These include the memory of tabernacle and temple, synagogue archi- tecture, design and decoration, the light and shadow cast by candles, the shape of Torah scrolls, their calligraphy and ornament, the sight of flora, fauna and crown on curtains covering the ark. Attempts to identify once and for all the priority of word over image only work to deaden an otherwise lively relationship. The value of one and the other sits beside, not one before the other, in a give and take that elide apriori philosophical and theological principles and privilege and pseudo-halakhic warrants. Language in the picture-frame provides broader theoretical contexts and spiritual rubrics with which to interpret visual material while altering our image of revelation. Religion brings to art another dimension of lived, linguistic content, with which, in a free society, its practitioners can do as they please; just as the form of art and aesthetics opens revelation further out into the world of sense and sensa- tion, into the spatial and temporal orders we share with other people, 24 Steven Schwarzschild, "The Legal Foundations of Jewish Aesthetics," 114. 25 W.

Philosophical insight and ethical probity are not unique to religion. The opposite, of course, is frequently the case. Revelation's distinctive and lasting contribution to the culture of human consciousness rests in its appeal to the imagination, in its power to charm or charge eye, ear, skin, tongue, and nose. From this possible point of departure, its logic and ethos ultimately ride upon "the science of perception." More-Than-a- Work-of-Art If in the modern Jewish philosophy between Cohen and Schwarzschild, Buber and Franz Rosenzweig sought to distance revelation from art it is because they shared a lively antipathy in respect to a basic form of nine- teenth century bourgeois culture: the canon of art for art's sake (l'art pour l'art). But the critique of art itself belongs to the history of modern art. Against the "pure aesthetics" of museums, books, and theaters, their anti-aesthetic was "completely free of the typical embellishments (übli- chen Verschönerungen)."26 As Rosenzweig once observed, translating a tale about God's revelation is more challenging than telling the tale of Hansel and Gretei. In the latter case, the story only has to be beautiful, while in telling tales about God's revelation, "it is not enough that it is beautiful, but rather it must also be true." At the surface level, translat- ing revelation only seems to have nothing to do with art. Even without Victorian embellishment, however, the image of revelation in the work of Buber and Rosenzweig is still aesthetic. It just belongs to a different order of beauty. Revelation is not impassive to shape and form. Rosenz- weig slyly added, "It cannot be indifferent to [God] what kind of tales His children tell about him, much less the name with which they name Him."27 In the history of modern art, the rhetoric of anti-aesthetics signals the passage of one style into another. Like "religion," the "aesthetic" is narrow and unreal, too pretty and too precious; it creates an artificial division between art and life that emergent avant-gardes seek to over- come with a new system of artifice. Rosenzweig recognized that the re- jection of romantic ornament and embellishment, the critique of rarifled 26 Franz Rosenzweig, Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 1, (Haag: Martinus Nijhoff, 1976- 1984). 849. 27 Ibid., 1042.</page><page sequence="15">380 Zachary Braiterman JSQ 1 1 and beautiful objects, was itself modern art-discourse. The nineteenth century, he wrote his parents in 1916, was "German," i. e. Gothic, orna- mental, romantic; unlike the twentieth century, which will be "Latin," i. e. unromantic, formal, constructive, and unsentimental, as in the work of Thomas Mann, Kafka, and anti-Wagnerian music.28 It was Expres- sionism that shaped what Rosenzweig once called, in reference to He- brew Scripture, his own unästhetisch-überästhetische Ästhetik.29 Not Ro- mantic and neo-romantic, art-for-art's-sake aestheticism gives way to the modernism identified by Rosenzweig. In doing so, revelation re- mained aesthetic but no longer "aesthetic." Rosenzweig did not want the translation to be seen as just a work of art. Translators had to respect the truth as it took shape in its original form.30 At the same time, the Bible translation was still a kind of art. In a 1927 letter to Ludwig Strauss, Rosenzweig asked, all things being equal, which possible translation of a verse from the book of Samuel he found more beautiful.31 Writing to Buber a few months earlier, he insisted, "Whoever expects a piece of art cannot understand us; even though it is one. But it is perceptible as such only for those who do not seek [art] in it. Just as the elegance of a mathematical proof [is perceptible] only to those who approach it with mathematical interest, not to those who seek elegance." Rosenzweig clarified that subject mat- ter dominates one's approach to any art-form. However, he went on to suggest that his and Buber's own aesthetic and aestheticism, and by this he meant their interest in form, blocked their path to even the most ordinary work of art {Kunstwerk) and not just to that which is a more- than-a-work-of-art {Mehralskunstwerk)}2 Much more than simply "more than a work of art," the Mehralskunstwerk, based as it is in the German construct form, preserves the link to art even as it severs it. If revelation takes a half-step removed from art, then art, like crea- tion, is but a half step from nature. The art of creation and the creation of art are always already permeated by judgment. "It is good," "it is very good." Reorganized into grids, each one is unique, each in tandem with the others. The apprehension of divinity hangs upon the play of word and color, the physical world of objects, and the complex acoustic and literary constructions. Rosenzweig was right to observe that religious contents without attention to aesthetic form risks turning into bare con- 28 Ibid., 204^5. 29 Ibid., 1153. 30 Ibid., 1037, 1041-2, 1052.

Revelation does not exist apart from the order, dis-order, and re- order of creation, from the form of part, whole, mass, color, tone, touch, and taste, from individual points, lines, spots, and dabs. It fits into crea- tion, which is a type of composition, a kind of art, a that-which-is-more- than-a-work-of-art in its formal constitution. Such claims rest upon a logic whose basic premise is that no aesthetic frame can isolate formal expression from everyday human life and existential mysteries. So-called isolated art objects manifest larger contextual nexi that situate them, and therein lies their social significance and spiritual status. Hocus-Pocus "Signs happen to us," Buber wrote in 1929. We try to ward them off with the assurance that "nothing is directed at you, you are not meant; it is just 'the world,' you can experience it as you like ... We have turned off our receivers."33 But is it really God who speaks to us "out of that decisive hour of personal existence?"34 Revelation and the spiritual in art do not occur outside the play of signs, the world of illusion and appear- ance, a trick of the eye and ear, and the power of social convention. And this renders them immediately suspect. Revelation depends upon the world of creation at the base of communication. Buber knew the com- parison was gauche when he went on to say that "all we know of the poet is what we learn of him in the poem."35 Understanding that "in our age especially, it appears extremely difficult to distinguish the one from the other," he asked in 1952, "Are you really addressed by the Absolute or by one of his apes?"36 Discourse is all we have and the possibility of revelation makes it no less patently fraudulent. Are revelation and the spiritual in art pure hocus-pocus? Profoundly embarrassed, the rabbis were alert to possible deception. Why, they ask, does Scripture state, "As Moses spoke, God answered him in thunder" (Ex. 19:19)? The prophet's communication, it would seem to appear, precedes the divine utterance. A master magician out of Egypt, he speaks first and then God responds. On the defensive, the rabbis explain that the text "merely teaches that Moses was endowed with strength and force and that God was helping him with His voice so that Moses could let Israel hear the same tone (neimah) which he himself heard" (Mekhilta 33 Martin Buber, Between Man and Man, (New York: Collier Books, 1965), 10-11. 34 Ibid., 14. 35 Ibid., 15. 36 Martin Buber, Eclipse of God, (New York: Harper, 1952), 119.</page><page sequence="17">382 Zachary Braiterman JSQ 1 1 de Rabbi Ishmael, tractate Bahodesh, chapter 4). While also modest, Moses was indeed a man of strength and force. The sensation of God's presence depends upon a combination of elements, sensual media drawn from the world of creation. What the rabbis fear without wanting to admit is that revelation has to be as such that even when the people's receivers are on, it is still not clear whose voice it communicates. Like any article relating to religious faith, we have known since at least Kant that revelation and the spiritual in art are not subject to strict, empirical investigation. One is caught before a hermeneutical choice one has just already made. Signs are conceivably everywhere: a physical landscape, the play of light, the sound made by animate crea- tures, the touch of skin upon skin, the smell of burning meat and in- cense, the human voice, the illuminated art figure, ritual performance, the exercise of reason, an ethical impulse and acts of violence, point, line, and abstract picture plane, any scripture or poetic utterance. Ac- cording to a radical philosophical realism, any physical sign remains just a sign, manifesting nothing beyond itself and its relation to other em- pirical signs. One rejects logical possibilities beyond any possible system of signs to adduce the trace of a non-material non-sign. In the romantic view, and also in the philosophy of Hegel, signs constitute symbols in which that surplus is partially /increasingly manifest. A seal inscribed with a lion imbeds power; a finite sign imbeds the infinite; a human scripture reflects the mind of God, a work of art the quintessence of humanity. The essence of the one participates in the essence of the other, a stance freighting expression with significance that no sign can carry for too long in the face of critical scrutiny. Both realist and romantic, Buber evoked an elusive presence that is fundamentally foreign to the artful sign-combinations into which it is necessarily drawn. There and then not- there, it hovers over the indivi- dual sign upon which it will glance, insinuating itself in the empty space between one sign and the other. "My beloved is like a gazelle or like a young stag. There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the win- dow, peering through the lattice" (Song of Songs 2:9). A mutant motion, its presence disappears before one can reach it in language. Visual marks, sonic combinations, tactile impressions and their interface with the human subject's perceptual, mental, and technological apparatus: signs are just signs, the product of the natural order writ large and the human hand writ small. They are themselves neutral because they have no inherent status prior to revelation, to that surplus which in autono- mous art Adorno called the "crackling noise ... in which the more of the phenomenon announces itself in opposition to this phenomenon."37 The</page><page sequence="18">(2004) Aesthetics and Judaism, Art and Revelation 383 discombobulation of elements through technics of repetition, this relief from historical context and realist reference, is a second-order moment in which a not-just-physical charge is wrapped about what Rainer Crone in his study of Klee calls "the deliberate combination of two discontin- uous systems."38 Such combinations are particularly rife when death and violence come into the picture. In The Satanic Verses, as told by Salman Rushdie, a terrorist explosion on board an airline 35,000 feet above the British coastline transforms a reluctant Indian film star by the name of Gibreel Farishta into the archangel Gabriel. He comes to Mahound. "It hap- pens. Revelation. Like this: Mahound, still in his notsleep, becomes ri- gid, veins bulge in his neck, he clutches at his center. No, no, nothing like an epileptic fit, it can't be explained away that easily; what epileptic fit caused day to turn to night, caused clouds to mass overhead, caused air to thicken into soup while an angel hung, scared silly, in the sky ... held up like a kite on a golden thread? The dragging again the dragging and now the miracle starts in my our guts, he is straining with all his might at something, forcing something, and Gibreel begins to feel that strength, forcing something, and Gibreel begins to feel that strength that force, here it is at my own jaw working it, opening shutting,; and the power, starting within Mahound, reaching up to my vocal cords and the voice comes." Gibreel proceeds to qualify, "Butbutbut God isn't in this picture."39 "Halfway into sleep, or halfway back to wakefulness, Gibreel Farishta is often filled with resentment by the non-appearance, in his persecuting vision, of the One who is supposed to have the an- swers, He never turns up, the one who kept away when I was dying, when I needed him most."40 In their rightful place between sensation and the imagination, revela- tion and the spiritual in art rely upon the wager that a non-material surplus lurks in the confused patterns of human expression. The Bible is not coy in the moral dynamite this brings to revelation. "You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. You shall not ill-treat any widow or orphan" (Ex. 22:20-21). And also "Remember what Amalek did to you . . . you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven" (Deut. 25:17-19), "If your brother, your own mother's son, or your son or daughter, or the wife of your bosom entices you in secret . . . Show him no pity or compassion, 37 Theodore Adorno, Aesthetic Theory, 79. 38 Rainer Crone and Joseph Leo Koerner, Paul Klee: Legend of the Sign, 48. 39 Salman Rushdie, The Satanic Verses, (New York: Viking, 1988), 112. 40 Ibid., 111.</page><page sequence="19">384 Zachary Braiterman JSQ 1 1 and do not shield him; but take his life" (Deut. 13:7-10), "When the Lord your God ... dislodges many nations before you ... you must doom them to destruction," (Deut. 7:1-2), "tear down their altars, smash their pillars, cut down their sacred posts, and consign their images to the fire (Deut. 7:5). Both sets of moral discourse are unavoid- able parts of the precarious historical trust that is its own interpretation. Hocus-pocus or not, there is nowhere else to see this scene of revelation "under His feet ... the likeness of a pavement of sapphire" (Ex. 24:10), "the appearance of the semblance of the glory" (Ezek. 1:28) simulta- neous to the play between its disappearance and re-appearance. Two points may be said in favor of provisionally holding on to the notion of an isolated art-object. First, definite epistemological over- reaching haunts any claim according human representation (e. g. poems, paintings, scriptures, language) super-ontological or theological signifi- cance. Ultimately the spiritual aesthetic that one finds advanced by the proponents of Expressionism in religion and art creak under too much critical scrutiny. At the most basic level, isolated art-objects, scriptural compositions, and ritual acts neither reveal nor constitute God's living word or spiritual presence. Viewed suspiciously, the luminosity they gen- erate speaks to the elaboration of their own performance. As for art- objects, they remain subject to the intense ethical vagaries of cultural capital and class privilege while providing simple, quotidian pleasure. Art-forms are the attendant fetish to political and cultural domination, but on their own, they are never worth the price of institutional blood shedding. On the acute attention paid by modernist writers to formal artifice, Robert Alter identifies the residual belief that they could outdo the pro- ponents of nineteenth century realism in registering psychological, so- cial, and even historical reality through the form of fiction.41 Revelation and the spiritual in art take this residue one step further. Pat contentions made by Rosenzweig in The Star of Redemption that "art" does not trust language turn a blind eye to the fact that artists such as Kandinsky and Klee placed the same trust in the visual media of color, line, and volume that Buber and Rosenzweig placed in the linguistic form of revelation. If this trust proves ultimately misguided, it is not because the claim that physical form can reveal a spiritual super-world is inherently ridiculous, but rather because such constellations are insufficiently problematized. The instability that stamps all acts of formal signification, especially in 41 Robert Alter, Partial Magic: The Novel as a Self- Conscious Genre, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975), 153.</page><page sequence="20">(2004) Aesthetics and Judaism, Art and Revelation 385 relation to religion and revelation, belies the simple trust in spiritual good with which one might otherwise invest in them. When form makes mystery manifest, it does so with the raw force of a subtle nullity that is impossible to verify, but upon which the theological edifice of all reli- gion, including Judaism, builds.</page></plain_text>
