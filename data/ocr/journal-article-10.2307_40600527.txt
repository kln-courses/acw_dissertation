(Portland: Portland Museum of Art, in association with the University of Washington Press, Seattle, 2005. Pp. 191, forewords, acknowledgments, introduction, photographs, bibliography. $49.95 cloth) Until quite recently the popular image of Pacific Northwest Native art was con- fined to the potlatch and the totem pole, an image that represents only Alaska- Canadian peoples. In the past decade, though, the arts of neighboring cultural regions, including the Columbia River, have been showcased through exhib- its, publications, apprentice programs, and gatherings such as the Northwest Native American Basketweaver's Association and the Northwest Native American Woodcarvers. The diligent efforts of elders, artists, and scholars have supported research and recovery of these tribes' living and dying traditions and have helped these arts to be better understood. People of the River is a timely book that celebrates and helps to define the rich artistry of the tribes of the Columbia, based upon an exhibit produced by the Portland Art Museum in collaboration with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. Though not without precedent (Schlick 1994), People of the River offers the most comprehensive coverage of these traditional arts to date; an unprec- edented breadth of material is gathered and displayed in both the exhibit and the book. I'm hopeful that people of the Columbia River tribes have gained great knowledge from the process of making this art available to the public. The book, abundantly illustrated with color plates throughout, starts with an array of pre-contact anthropomorphic bone figures, followed by masks, figurai posts, and bowls, utensils, and tools ornamented with animal carvings. The middle sec- tion features basketry, especially the cylinder baskets prevalent along the River and Plateau, exquisite cornhusk bags found throughout the region (though sometimes wrongly associated exclusively with the Nez Perce), and fine sally bags and coiled baskets. The last part of the book highlights beadwork beauti- fully displayed on panel bags, octopus bags, pouches, wall pockets, doll cradles, horse collars and blankets, and decorative bags and regalia. Throughout, there is much material for contemplation of Columbia River artistry and history - the many different types of beads, their uses, and the evolution of beadwork in the context of Euroamerican cultural exchange; the presence of Iroquoian and Algonquian influences, which bespeaks intertribal trading over very long dis- tances; a thought-provoking headdress of the late nineteenth century, adorned with coins from China. This "can't put down" coffee-table book has a visual impact to match its large format. Reading through it takes two awe-inspiring hours and gives you sore arms. Books of this type, with their lavish illustrations and their huge size, have a reputation for having little intellectual value. Yet while some coffee-table books are mere eye candy or collectable kitsch, others provide extraordinary aesthetic experience as well as research-based contextual support for the illustrations. People of the River is in the latter category. Another issue surrounding coffee table books has to do with their size, cost and intended audience. Do coffee table books represent a medium that mas- sages its content in a particular way for a particular audience? In People of the River the wineskin is created for the drinker of the wine, for this book is directed outwards to collectors of Native American art, museum-goers, and academics. The publisher has a strong selection of similar publications (e.g., Wright 1991), and the book's formatting, design, and distribution are geared to bookstores</page><page sequence="2">People of the River 125 and buyers with known expectations and standards. To meet these standards, the publisher has created a large-format product too expensive for the people whose art is featured. There can be good or bad results when a coffee-table book provides docu- mentation of the Other. In the best case, the general public has access to greater knowledge and understanding, either through the book itself or through the exhibit that may have preceded it - perhaps in an online version available to all. On the other hand, there is risk of commodification of the Other if the material is packaged as esoteric or exotic, or as a romantic remnant of the past. Coffee- table books often use this shallow approach, which explains why folklorists who document folk artists and their cultures often avoid the medium. (Besides, it would be unlikely that the people themselves would be the primary audience for such a book because of the cost.) The absence of a folklorist's perspective is felt in The People of the River, both exhibit and book, for both are constructed with virtually no link to the present. The material consists of historical artifacts assembled from prominent Pacific Northwest collections. As with many museum exhibits, its focus is on the art and the culture, not on the maker. Beyond acknowledging a few master artists of the early twentieth century, there is little recognition of artists keeping Columbia River art traditions alive today, such as (among many others) Pat Courtney Gold, an advisor to the exhibit, and Klickitat basketmaker Nettie Jackson, both of whom are National Endowment for the Arts Heritage Fellows. Two other glar- ing absences: musical instruments (surely indigenous to these tribes, and surely music, song, and dance played a role in their cultures), and weapons. Of course, no exhibit can possibly include everything. A good exhibit, like a good meal, leaves you yearning for at least a little more. Our coffee tables are large enough for only so many coffee-table books, and those few we select for display must say something about us and about our consuming interests. My interest in Native American traditions has earned the praiseworthy People of the Rivera, spot on my own coffee table, where it now keeps company with Glassie (1989), and Murray (1997), and Seike (1980).
