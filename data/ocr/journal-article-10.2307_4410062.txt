<plain_text><page sequence="1">Institutions and Incentives in a Garhwal Village -II Changing State-Village Interactions The study of household incentives in the conservation of common resources and the impact of state rules and regulations on such incentives should form the basis for a new paradigm of state-village interactions in the post-Chipko environment. Using forest use statistics this article shows that there has been a dramatic shift in the post-Chipko years away from state tnd commercial appropriation of forest resources. In the absence of visible conflicts, the everyday interaction between the state and local inhabitants has assumed greater importance and this everyday interaction is characterised by a critical difference between 'survival' and 'commercial' activities, as well 'as a difference in the management of resources that are perceived as 'stable-in-nature' (such as a fishery) and those that are perceived as 'flexible-in-nature' (such as a forest which can be cut down to make agricultural plots). These two differences form the basis for the construction of a 'moral' economy of the state as well as the sound management of common resources. [The first part of this article appeared in issue of December 2-8, 2000.] JISHNU DAS I Introduction I have argued earlier using evidence from village Salang in Garhwal, that a study of institutions is insuffi- cient for an understanding of the manage- ment of common resources. Using ex- amples of 'conservationist' institutions, such as access restrictions to forestland, I have shown how such practices can be re-interpreted as rational responses to a labour-shortage economy rather than as a reflection of sound governance of com- mon resources. Thus, in studies of local practices, it becomes important to closely examine the incentives of the population as well as the overall economic environment. Here the argumerits are extended to developments in the village during the 20th century. Using evidence on the fell- ing of trees, I show that there has been a dramatic shift in the nature of state-village interactions following the Chipko move- ment. While data from the pre-1970 period closely accords with stylised facts in the literature, such as the demarcation of the forest as a commercial entity and the large scale felling of trees by state and industrial concerns, the post-Chipko environment has seen a large scale decline in both these activities. I argue that the consequent absence of visible conflict calls for the development of a new paradigm of state- village interactions where the rules and regulations of the state are studied through their influence on the incentives of users to preserve common resources, rather than through their direct impact on common resource use. With increasing accessibility and the resultant marketisation of hill economies, two careful distinctions must be made, both in the nature and the use of the common resource. In particular, important differ- ences arise in the use of common resources between 'commercial' and 'survival' acti- vities, as well as the nature of common resources, which may be either 'stable in nature' or 'flexible in nature', a distinction discussed in greater detail below. These differences are analysed in the case study of a settlement of Salang, which show how the regulations of the state combined with a 'flexible-use' resource may lead to depletion of a common resource. The rest of the introduction illustrates this argu- ment with the help of an example and shows that institutions of resource use are not sufficient to explain the patterns of usage which may develop. An important determinant is the incentives of the users, and altering the institutions may not change the use patterns of such resources if the underlying incentives remain unchanged. Most studies of common resources [Ostrom 1990; Berkes 1989], have con- centrated on their preservation in cases where the use of such resources is per- ceived as 'stable' i e, cases where the people using the resource believe that the use pattern of the resource will remain un- changed overtime, such as a fishery, where the management's objective is to restrict fishing to allow sustainability in use. This research indicates that a crucial distinction must be made in the analysis. of common resources between cases where the re- sources are perceived as 'stable in nature' and in those where they are perceived as 'flexible in nature'. A resource is defined as 'stable in nature' if users believe that it will continue to be used in the same ,manner, and as 'flexible in nature' if the users believe that the resource and its use patterns will be altered in the near future. For example, pasture land which people believe will continue to be used as a pasture in the future is perceived as a stable in nature resource, while pasture land which Economic and Political Weekly December 9, 2000 4445</page><page sequence="2">people believe should be turned into an agricultural plot is perceived as a 'flexible in nature' resource. The rationality and incentives for pres- ervation in these two cases is significantly different. In cases where the resource is perceived as stable (and hence necessary for the communities 'economic activities), it is rational for the users to ensure its sustainability - pasture land that is unable to provide pasture due to overuse leads to a decline in dairy production. However, if a resource is viewed as flexible, it is entirely possible that for the community of users it is not optimal to ensure its preservation- if a village believes that a forest can be cleared for more beneficial agricultural plots, preservation of the forest would imply a decrease in the food potential of the village. In this case, preservation would be possible only if the beneficiaries of pres- ervation (conservationists, possibly out- side the system) compensate local users for the loss incurred by such a strategy. As an examplel consider a village where data on firewood use and the regenerative capacity of the forest leads a development agency to the conclusion that the forest will be cut down over a period of time, despite village level regulatory institutions restricting its use. This results in the decision to provide villagers with solar cookers, hence decreasing the dependence on the forest for fuel, and presumably halting depletion. Such a policy prescrip- tion, however, assumes that the commu- nity perceives the forest as a stable-use resource. Contrary to expectations, it is possible that the forest would actually be felled by the villagers in the near future. The crucial factor is whether the forest is viewed by the villagers as an impediment to agricultural plantations (i e, a flexible in nature resource) in which case the only reason that the forest is not felled is be- cause of its necessity as a provider of essential firewood. With the provision of solar cookers, this essential dependence is erased, and the last obstacle to the felling of the forest cleared. Given the inforna- tion base2 of the villagers, it is optimal to fell the forest once fuel needs are met from other sources, since the food growing capacity of an agricultural plot is higher than that of the forestland.3 As this example suggests, to analyse problems associated with common land usage, it is important to examine house- hold specific strategies that emerge as a consequence of existing incentive struc- tures. Hence, this paper, through the con- struction of such a paradigm in the region studied, represents a first step towards understanding the incentive structures and the relationship between common resources and state regulations in the post-Chipko environment. The remainder of this study is structured as follows: Section II studies the relationship between the state and Salang from 1900-1970 using state docu- ments and forest use plans. Section III argues that the post-Chipko years present a dramatic break with the previous history, and Section IV shows how the state is experienced in the governance of common resource since 1970. Section V presents a case study of Udaara settlement while Section VI concludes with a discussion of the role of the state as a provider of incentives. II The State in Salang: 1864-19754 The land and forests of Salang fall under the Bukki5 forest beat and are divided into Class 1 reserved forests and civil forests. Historically, the commercial value of the forests of Garhwal came to be recognised outside the Tehri kingdom with the lease given to an Englishman, Wilson between 1840-50 for the unrestricted use of the forests. This lease was later extended for a period of 14 years for the sum of Rs 400/ annum. With the development of the rail- ways and an antiseptic treatment for Chir (a variety of pine), there was growing recog- nition of the vast potential of Garhwali forests as a source of revenue. As Fernandes (1983), Guha (1985) and others have argu- ed, the unhindered commercial exploita- tion of forests could be possible only through the assertion of state monopoly rights. To further this aim, the Act of 1878 provided for the constitution of reserved forests that 'divested existing rights of users to enable sustained timber produc- tion' (Guha pp 38-39). Monopoly rights were extended with control of the forests reverting to the state, concomitantly with the founding of the'state forest department under a conser- vator of forests on May 1, 1885. Forest use statistics and official discourse on perceptions of the forest between 1896 and the Chipko movement in this region closely conform to the stylised facts of the state-forest relationship during this period. During the earlier half of this period, succes- sive conservators attempted to categorise the forest into commercially profitable sections, and to maximise revenue through the pursuit of 'scientific forest manage- ment techniques'. In areas where these techniques clashed with the customary practices of the villagers, restrictions were placed on the forest rights of the local population. From 1896-1936 there was a serious attempt to delineate the rights of the villagers from those of the state and to 'divide' the forest in a manner conducive for the commercial exploitation of several tree species such as Decdar, Kail and Chir. Between 1897-1904 all forests of Deodar, Sal, Papri and Chir were demarcated and commercial Chir felling were started in 1895-96. Further, 'in spite of serious opposition by villagers', the then conserva- tor of forests, Pandit Keshav Nand started the regulation of felling and extraction of forest produce by local communities. The complete separation of forests for state and for village use was undertaken between 1907 and 1915, through the divi- sion of forestland into the present classi- fication of reserve forests, Class I and II and Civil forests. All customary village activities (grazing and lopping) were prohibited in Class I reserve forests, while in Class II reserve forests, felling and extraction was permitted only for 'bona fide' requirements.Thecivilforestscouldhow- ever, be used in an unregulated manner with the proviso that the raj retained the right to dispose of all 'surplus' produce, to withdraw any or all rights, and to convert a civil into a Class I reserve forest The preparation of the first regular working plan, which brought the forests of Uttarkashi division under 'systematic' management for the first time was taken up in September 1936. Each forest'block' was divided into a number of compart- ments depending on topographical and land use patterns, and these compartments were classified individually as constitut- ing a 'working circle'. Under this plan three working cirlces (the Chir, the Deodar and the protected) were constituted, with different rules of usage and exploitation. For example, while grazing was permitted in the Chir working circle, in the Deodar circle sections were closed for grazing. Similarly, in the protected working circle, lopping was prohibited where the 'crop' (forest cover) was reduced to a bushy state. The methods and forestry systems un- derlined in this working plan remained in use till 1965, when an extensive rework- ing was undertaken by V B Singh in the 1965-75 working plan. The objectives of this working plan were laid out as follows: (1) To conserve, protect and improve the quality and density of existing forests; (2) To progress in the direction of a normal 4446 Economic and Political Weekly December 9, 2000</page><page sequence="3">forest; (3) To extend the forest wherever possible by artificial plantations; (4) Con- sistent with the above, to provide for the legitimate requirements of the local popu- lation for timber, fuel, grazing, etc, and (5) To obtain the 'maximum safe annual yield' possible (Uttarkashi Division, work- ing plan, 1965-75). To attain these objec- tives, there were 11 main changes in the 1965 working plan, and out of these 11 changes, only one - the formation of a fuel working circle to cater to the needs of Uttarkashi township - was unrelated to increasing the commercial yield of forest produce. Other changes included a de- crease in the rotation and conversion Table 1: Commercial Tree Felling 18641938 Trees Felled (in Cubic Feet) Period Deodar Kail Chir Papri 1864-85 10,000 - 1,000 1885-1911 12,250 - 12,511 3,012 1911-38 17,453 17,998 1,62,826 2,801 Source.

Both the nature of official discourse, through the working plans of the forest department, as well as the successive measures taken to increase the commercial value of forest produce during this period closely con- forms to the findings of Guha's study (1988) of state-village interactions in the region. As Guha has argued, the primary concern of the forest department was to maximise the revenueearned from the sale of forest produce, an objective reflected in the data on tree felling by the state between 1864-1938 (Table 1). From 1949-60, there was also a sharp increase in the number of trees given to commercial users, and con- sequently, a significant increase in forest revenue during this period (Table 2). This preoccupation with increasing the forest revenue translates into the strongly recurring theme through the working plans of the construction of the forest as a solely economic entity by the state, where tradi- tional activities of the villagers have to be restricted because they may decrease the commercial value of the 'crop'. Often cus- tomary forest-related activities of villagers were regarded as posing a threat to the commercial value of the forest.

Examples of man's destructive activi- ties include 'lopping and felling whereby low-level kokat and oak forests are suf- fering greatly, particularly near villages' as well as 'grazing...(due to which) natural regeneration is invariably retarded' The overriding objective of the 1965 working plan, thus, was- to detail systems of management designed to exploit forests for commercial use. It was believed that villagers who do not recognise the com- mercial value of the forests, generated the major source of uncertainty in the envi- ronment. Hence, these activities were strictly regulated and controlled leading, in several cases, to direct conflict between the forest department and villages in the region. One example of this conflict was the practice of burning Chir needles and grass in the month of March. The needles and grass were burnt to aid the move- ment of cattle (the needles are extremely slip pery) and to promote the growth of new grass. The forest department rules however, did not permit any sort of burning under their strict 'fire-control' regimes. This discussion of the working plans and their evolution presents strong support for the hypothesis that the state, during this period, constructed the forest as a purely commercial enterprise, where the maxi- misation of revenue was the overriding concern. To attain this objective, state monopoly rights were instituted over the forest, followed by the imposition of a number of restrictions on the traditional forest related activities of villagers in the region: As has been well documented, the subsequent alienation of the local inhabitants gave rise to large-scale pro- test movements such as the Tilari and the Chipko. While these movements have been studied extensively, the role of the state in the post-Chipko environment has received very little attention. In the next section, I argue that the developments following the Chipko movement call fora new paradigm in state-village interactions, where emphasis is placed oq the state as an entity that affects individual incentives towards resource protection, rather than as a direct appropriator of forest produce. ill 1970-1995: Shift In Strategies and Need for New Framework Table 3 presents data on the felling of trees in traditional Salang land collected from the forest ranger's office at Bhatwari. The data shows that in the last two decades Economic and Political Weekly December 9, 2000 4447</page><page sequence="4">the use of common resources by the state, particularly timber, has declined consid- erably. In Garhwal, the fall in felling of trees by the state has come about primarily because Qf the success of the Chipko movement, 'which resulted in a morato- rium on commercial felling for a period of 15 years from 1980 onwards. The charac- teristics of this decline can be understood through an examination of the detailed compartment histories that. form the ad- ministrative division of the common lands of Salang.6 For purposes 6f comparison, I divide the 1960-95 history is divided into two periods: 1960-70 and 1970-95. The division of forest data for these two periods leads to the following ob- servations7: There has been a substantial decline in the number of trees felled in the second period. Commercial felling has decreased sig- nificantly in period II, both in terms of the number of trees felled as well as a proportion of the total felling in the area. The total number of trees commercially felled in the second period was 22, com- pared to 5,400. for Period I. Similarly, felling for departmental use has also seen a decline in the second period. In most cases, the decrease in the pro- portion of trees being felled for commercial needs is compensated for by an increase in the proportion of those felled for village rights, concessions and free grants. There has also been an increase in the ab- solute number of trees felled for village use. Finally, there was a sharp increase in the illegal felling of Deodar in the second period. As we will discuss later, this in- crease occurred after the earthquake, when Deodars were used to rebuild broken houses. The data show that from 1970 onwards, there has been a marked shift away from commercial felling. As environmental concerns grow stronger, it is likely that the trends observed in the last two decades will continue, supported by the develop- ment of a largely non-interventionist ap- proach by the forest department, where the stated aim has been to allow natural forests to emerge and to undertake plantations in denuded areas. Hence, in present day Salang,.instead of expropriation by the state being the major issue, the manage- ment and use of such resources is crucially linked to the incentive structures of local inhabitants, which are continuously modi- fied as a result of state rules and policies. A re-examination of the paradigm of the state with regard to local communities and common resources would therefore call for the construction of a framework within which state actions are regarded as param- eters affecting household decision making processes, and emphasis is placed on the relationship between the village and the state in an everyday sense. Three interlinked perceptions regarding the state's role in the use and management of common resources have emerged from my fieldwork. First, an implicit 'moral' economy seems to underlie the use and regulation of common resources by the state. Within this' moral economy a clear distinction has emerged in the practices of the state between commercial and survival activities based on common resources, even though this is insufficiently formalis- ed in the form of legal regulations. Thus, although illegal commercial activities are closely controlled by the forest depart- ment, illegal survival actives are mostly overlooked. Closely linked to this dichoto- my is the question of monitoring and enforcement costs in the hills. The costs of monitoring the survival use of common resources are extremely high compared to that of monitoring commercial activities - a difference which significantly affects the way in which forest department rules are interpreted and implemented at the grass root level. Finally, state rules regard- ing village boundaries and access restric- tions significantly affect the management of common resources. In the case study of Udaara, inappropriate rules combined with a 'flexible in nature' resource may have lead to depletion of forest cover. State In Present-Day Salang: Commercial and Survival Activities The commercial-survival divide, which is crucial in the monitoring and use of common resources in present day Salang can actually be traced back to the years prior to the 1936 working plan. Although the assertion of monopoly rights over the forests of Garhwal by the king was accom- panied by the imposition of restrictions on villager's activities in common lands around the village, the restrictions focused largely on the control of illegal commer- cial use of forest produce by the villagers, and on activities which could harm the commercial value of the resource, rather than on the survival activities of the villagers,8 a distinction which is implicitly acknowledged in the grants of 'rights and concessions' governed by the Tehri State Durbar Circular 21 of 1930 (Table 4). The traditional rights and concessions granted under this circular highlights the distinction between a 'survival' and a 'com- mercial' activity. For example, villagers could collect the quantity of fodder, grass etc, necessary to meet 'bona fide' require- ments. The use of the term 'bona fide' was confusing in this respect; 'bona fide' requirements do not imply that the amount of fodder collected should be sufficient only to feed existing cattle. Instead there is a notion of commercial sale implicit in the definition of the term which is clarified further in the document: a 'grazing fee' is imposed for 'professionals' - those selling milk products to the market, and hence indulging in commercial activities - while all non-professionals collected grass as part of their 'bona fide' require- ments. Thus, the actual amount of grass collected is immaterial - what is important is whether this use of the pastures is for commercial sale or survival use. In the post-Chipko environment, this distinction seems to have re-emerged as an important characteristic of state-vil- lage interactions. Despite this resurrec- tion, the official recognition of village requirements is often insufficient to meet subsistence requirements, especially in Table 4: Rights and Concesslons of the Villagers for Taknore, 193014 Main Category Sub Category Usage Allowed Timber Building, chir (in cft) 9,730 Building, kokat (in .cft) 29,190 Chaans, kokat (number of trees) 1,390 Agricultural implements Kokat (number of trees) 278 Free grazing Buffaloes 365 Cattle 6,731 Sheeps and goats 26,705 Chaans' All existing may be used Burning ghats All existing may be used Fuel, fodder, grass Includes fruits, Ringal, Quantity necessary to meet 'bona fide' roots and torch wood requirements may be used 4448 Economic and Political Weekly December 9, 2000</page><page sequence="5">times of crises brought on by failed crops, floods or other natural disasters. In such cases, a discrepancy seems to emerge between official rules regarding the use of common resources and the actual prac- tices followed by functionaries of the forest department. In Salang today, the main agent of the state is the forest department and its officials. The forest department issues permits for jari bootis (medicinal herbs), sets up tenders for the cutting of dry trees, deals with requests from villag- ers for extraordinary demands of wood (e g, for houses), and monitors the ex- change and consumption of forest re- sources. Within this framework, the com- mercial-survival divide is characterised by a rift between the formal structure of rules and regulations and the informal operation of the forest department,9 whereby activities contravening the offi- cial rules are permitted to the extent that they represent a survival rather than a profit motive. For example, a number of houses damaged during the earthquake were rebuilt in 1994-95, which required substantial amounts of wood. The Salang patrol officer permitted the felling of dried trees, in clear contravention of the rules, whereby such trees were marked and auctioned off to a contractor, typically from outside the village. One house-builder described-his interaction with the officer as follows: "The officer said that I know you need the wood badly, you can use the dried Deodars for your houses, and I will not look at the places where you are felling trees, woh aadmi bahoot hi acchaa nikla (the man turned out to be a good person). However, if we had cut a green Deodar (valued at about Rs 0.80 lakh), he would definitely have filed a case and we would have been in big trouble (aafataaajaati)."1 0 This increased illegal felling is reflected in the data for 1992-93, when the number of Deodars illegally felled jumps to 36 from an average of 0.5 for the last 10 years. Although forest department files have records of some,of the offenses, no prosecution pro-. ceedings have been instituted. This particular event points to a very interesting aspect of the relation between the state and the village commlinity. In much of the literature on this relationship, especially by the historians of the subal- tern school, the state is seen as a usurper of the customary rights of the villagers. By choosing the moment of rebellion by village or tribal communities, which by its nature represents the state-village re- lations at their most hostile moments, they have arrived at a theory of the state that completely ignores the structure of every- day life. In my own interaction with the villagers I found that the moral economy of the village was recognised by the state department for some purposes allowing the villagers to use certain resources of the forest, especially in times of need (characterised by survival requirements), while for other resources the villagers concede the power of the state over as- pects of life that may have earlier been totally under their own control (characterised by commercial use). When this mutual relation of recognising and conceding rights to each otherbreaks down is a subject of great interest and is best written within a more nuanced description of events than the subaltern school's orientation would permit. The neglect of everyday life in the evolution of state/ village relations over the use of common resources seems to be a major flaw of the present approaches to this problem. Monitoring and Enforcement of Rules Closely related to the sanction given to survival activities through the creation of an everyday 'moral' economy is the ques- tion of monitoring and enforcement of state rules in inaccessible terrains. The 1965 working plan places a significant number of restrictions on community use of common lands. Clearly, if villagers are to be restricted according to the guide- lines of the plan (in several cases to below minimum consumption levels-as in timber grants), the system of monitoring and enforcement has to be extremely efficient. The efficiency of the existing system is far below this desired level - for the entire Bukki beat and three compartments of the Huri beat (an area comprising over 6000 acres), there is a single forest guard for monitoring activities of the villagers, and this problem is noted in the working plan. For example, the plan notes that, "The felling rules were in actual practice, sel- dom observed. Grazing continues, to be uncontrolled and unrestricted. In no case was it closed in any area, though depleted areas existed all around the villages. Laxity in the control of grazing and lopping was a great divisional default, which is explained on the grounds that any check in this connection would involve a complaint from the public. While this is fairly plausible, the absolute necessity of such a check according to rules and orders cannot be minimised and remains a problem for which a solution must be found." (Uttarkashi district, working plan, 1965). Due to the high costs of monitoring activities in remote hillsides, over the years monitoring has become concentrated towards activities on the roads where costs are relatively low. The forest department has the right to stop and check any vehicle for export of illegal forest product, as well as to seize illegal products from markets in the townships. The combination of the rules of the forest department and the lack of monitoring possibilities leads us back to the distinction between 'survival' and 'commercial' activities: given the topo- graphical structure of the hills, most areas are connected by a single road, and all transportation has to take place along this link. Thus, all commercial activities can be controlled through low cost monitoring at roads and markets. As a result, illegal survival activities have a far lower risk of punishment than illegal commercial activities, since in most cases the latter are concentrated along the road and at market centres, while villager's activities in hills away from the road are almost impossible to monitor. Hence, the 'moral' rationale for the separa- tion between' commercial and survival activities becomes strongly supported by the economic rationale of relative costs of monitoring in the two cases. The development of an everyday moral economy combined with the concentration of monitoring activities along the roads also raises important questions regarding the validity of claims based on the direct extrapolation of the provisions of the Indian Forest Act on the population of a given region [Sanwal 1989; Fernandes 1983]. Several studies have attempted to construct a direct causal relationship between the provisions of subsequent forest acts and the consequences for the population. This work shows that there are at least two levels - the forest department and the agents of the department (rangers and chowkidars)- which act as an insulation between the pro- visions of any forest act and ground level implications. Thedata and research strongly suggests that the problems associated with efficient monitoring and the development of an everyday moral economy would lead us to a situation where it is not possible to accurately predict the effects of legis- lation on the ground level practices of state functionaries without closely examining the specificities of each case. Economic and Political Weekly December 9, 2000 4449</page><page sequence="6">Impact of Rules ahd Regulations Finally, moving away from the ways in which state functionaries have affected household decisions regarding common resource usage, I now examine the role of state rules regarding common lands in affecting incentive structures of villagers with regard to the use of such resources. One such rule, which has had considerable impact on the management of common re- sources, is the re-formulation of traditional inter-village boundaries in this region. Given the topographical nature of the mountains, village lands were always divided according to existing ridges and rivers - traditional Salang land was bounded by the river on one side, and mountain ridges on the other two, which enclosed a triangular village space. As the argument in Part I illustrates while exclu- sion was not important in common land away from the village, the boundaries were crucial for the successful management of the commons around the village, which were carefully monitored to.prevent use by outsiders.11 Boundaries were re-drawn with the rule instituted by the state according to which, any village may collect bona fide require- ments from within a range of 5 miles (8 km) from the village. This range is proving to be a major obstacle in the attempts of villagers to exclude outsiders from traditional village commons, since there is now significant overlapping of common land between villages. Accord- ing to this range definition, traditional Salahg land may be used by as many as seven villages for collection of forest produce, and in the following case study of Udaara, I analyse the process through which this inability to exclude has led to the degeneration of regulatory mechanisms for local commons, particularly pasture and forest resources. IV Case Study: Udaara The case of Udaara, a lower settlement of Salang, demonstrates how the rules and regulations of the state combined with a 'flexible in nature' resource leads to in- appropriate resource use, even in the absence of direct state appropriation. In this case, as shown below, the replacement of local systems of management by a supra- local rule-maker and enforcer, adversely affected individual incentive structures towards the regulation of the commons. Traditionally, Udaara used to be the winter pasture for families in Salang. Households would migrate down with their cattle for three months, since the lower altitude implied that grass for the herds was available throughout the year. In the last two decades however, this settlement has acquired a more permanent nature: agricultural fields around the area are fully utilised; several families have stopped migrating with their cattle instead using the grass around the settlement for the entire year. As a result significant short- ages have developed in the availability of both firewood and pasture lands in these areas. The exact nature of this transition is a complex result of disasters and sub- sequent compensation by the state which led to greater investment in immovable capital (houses and shelters), combined with the problems arising from the non- recognition of traditional boundaries by the state. In 1972, after a fire destroyed twenty 'chaans' (huts of wood and stone), the families received Rs 250 from the govern- ment, which was then used to construct more permanent shelters. Again, in 1991, after an earthquake, the compensation receivedXRs 15,000) was used to construct permanent cement and stone structures. The substantial capital investment resulted in a disincentive to migrate back to the village, despite significant shortages. The Table 5 details the chronological develop- ment of Udaara. This movement towards a permanent settlement was marked by the conversion of forest and pastureland into agricultural land as well as the destruction of tradi- tional systems of management, used to regulate grasslands in the settlement. Till 1988, a grass ban was imposed for six' months of the year (April-November), which was enforced by a village regulatory body. Five chowkidars (watchmen) were chosen for this period of the year, and powers of confiscating the tools of herders from other villages, and referring indi- viduals to the gram panchayat for fines was invested in them. Two court cases, dating back to 1939 and 1945 show that these village boundaries were also recognised by the official administrative machinery - in these cases outsiders using the grass in Salang were fined and warned that similar infringements in the future would warrant heavy penalties. In 1987, the then district magistrate of Uttarkashi was unable to endorse the grass ban since it was not an official measure. Instead he suggested that the ban be given an official designation by transforming it into a plan for overall forest security (van rakshit). The inability of the supra-local enforcer (in this case the DM) to endorse .the grass ban implied that the local author- ity of the gram panchayat was undermined, and the possible strategies of villagers using grass during the months of the ban was widened to include the official filing of' complaints with the Patwari in cases where they were fined. Villagers realised that such complaints would receive a favourable hearing and thus the grass ban was lifted. The warmer climate and the lifting of the grass ban provided an incentive for even more households to migrate to these settlements. Till 1987, families living permanently in Udaara had been forced to send their cattle to higher pasture lands during the months of the ban through an exchange system where the herder took half the dairy produce of the herd. Follow- ing the collapse of the ban, several house- holds discontinued this practice, 'instead using the grass around Udaara on a perennial basis..12 In the last two years, there has also been a substantial increase in the indiscriminate use of firewood and grass by inhabitants of neighbouring villages. When asked why these outsiders were not stopped, villagers cited a case that was recently decided in the Allahabad High Court, where the court stated that land not held privately belonged to the forest department, and use of such land could not be restricted to any single community. The perception of the villagers regarding the outcome of this case has implied that they are unable to stop outsiders from using traditional village resources. This case study raises important ques- tions regarding the role of the state in the management of common lands, and the dynamic process through which a local institution of regulation and enforcement .decays with the constraints it faces. Part I of this paper, argued that the closely monitored common lands were those around the village, where thl labour costs of resource extraction were minimised. Since the land around Udaara was traditionally part of these guarded commons, it is likely that access restrictions to grass and wood in this area woqld have continued in the absence of counterproductive state poli- cies. There were two important reasons for the destruction of forest and pasture land in this settlenment. 4450 Economic and Political Weekly December 9, 2000</page><page sequence="7">Firstly, the inadvertent destruction of traditional boundaries through the replace- ment of local by state rules (villagers may graze cattle for a distance of 5 kms from the village as the crow flies) has created an adverse incentive structure where the re-imposition of access and regulatory restrictions has become practically impos- sible because of encroachment by commu- nities across the river. Villagers argue that regulation of grass cutting among the community cannot be imposed because there is no way they can stop outsiders from using the grass during the months of the ban. In this case, villagers are incurring greater labour costs without being able to ensure sustainability of the pasturelands around Udaara. The problem is com- pounded by the fact that there are close kinship links between Salang and the villages around it and people in Udaara are reluctant to ask outsiders to leave: "How can I tell my own nephew to get out of our land ? The only way this problem can be solved is if the DM makes a rule, in which case, everyone, irrespective of ties (nata) has to obey". The underlying logic seems to be that a directive from the state authorities will reduce the responsibility (and hence, the cost) of the person enforc- ing access restrictions around Udaara.13 Secondly, the forest and pasturelands around the settlement are not 'stable in nature' resources. To the extent that vil- lagers remained dependent on these pas- tures and forestlands instead of outside employment, it is likely that the pattern of destruction would have been different. However, one of the major factors in the decrease of common resources around the settlement has been the conversion of such land into privatised agricultural holdings, often cultivating crops sold in the market nearby. Combined with an increase in income from non-land based activities, this has led to a decrease in the incentives for preservation in the settlement. The pattern of common resource usage in this case is a result of complex and interrelated changes in the incentive struc- ture of villagers that have occurred with a change in the environment within which they exist. The restriction of exclusion possibilities through the imposition of regionally inappropriate boundary rules was supplemented by the weakening of intra-community regulations by an exten- sion of the villager's strategy space. In a historical sense, the grass ban was first lifted because of the increased options a villager violating the ban faced; because of the DM's directive, it had now become possible to countermand the panchayat's ruling by an appeal to the patwari. As the above discussion shows, the emergence of an authority superior to the local institu- tion proved critical in the management of the common lands around Udaara. Through this study of Udaara, I have argued that even in the absence of direct extraction of common resources, it is possible for state rules to have an adverse effect on incentive structures of villagers towards preservation of common resources. The complex interaction between com- pensation rules, rules of access restric- tions, development of markets, and the creation of a supra-local authority, which undermined the .authority of the local enforcement institution, resulted in the lifting of the grass ban around Udaara. It is interesting to observe that similar prob- lems were noticed in Nepal where the post- nationalisation destruction of the chowkidari system in the Khumbu region of Nepal once again led to indiscriminate use and accelerated resource depletion [Thomas and Warburton 1985]. The case study also questions the con- ventional conception of 'outsiders' as agents who do not belong to a particular local system; in the case of Garhwal, the outsiders have normally been identified as the state or commercial users from the plains. In Udaara, however, it is the villagers from neighbburing villages, who were seen as 'outsiders' in relation to access over common resources. This suggests that consensus about the rights over common property resources may break down even in local society so that the category of outsiders may include not only the distant state and commercial institutions but also members of other villagers, thus complicating the picture normally pre- sented of consensus at the level of local society broken only by institutions of state and market. V Conclusion Both synchronic and diachronic studies have emphasised the dynamic nature of the state-village interaction and the complex- ity and variability of causal relations between the actions of the state and the management otcommon resources. In this study I have focused on one area, Salang, and studied the inter-temporal process of change through this century, and its im- plications for the use and management of common resources in the region. Three distinct stages were identified in the evo- lution of state-village interaction in the community. In the pre-state period, Salang was characterised by resource-abundance and labour-shortage and local level institutions often developed as responses to the his- torical requirement of minimising labour usage. This period has been portrayed as approaching a utopian ideal of community management of common resources, where local levels of production easily met basic needs. In people's memory however, this period is described as one of food-short- age, hunger and systems of extensive regulation and control of common resources by the Tehri state. This study attempts to show that it is unlikely for village-level management of common resources to have developed during this period: in several Table 5: Chronology of Movement towards Udaara Year Status Comments 1970 No houses, 18 chaans Chaans were used for winter cattle rearing due to the lower altitude 1972 Chaans burnt by fire Compensation received from the Government at Rs 250/chaan 1972 Semi-permanent structures Occupation still restricted to winter months built with compensation 1982 22 Semi-permanent Huts Part of the forest and pasture land was cleared for more agricultural plots 1985 Villagers start sending children 6-7 children enrolled at the high-school to the high-school at Bhatwari 1985 Three permanent families move Two out of the three families had household heads to Udaara. 18 families live for enrolled as teachers in the school.

With the development of commercial forestry and the establishment of a state monopoly over the forests of Salang, the forest came to be construed primarily as a source for economic profit in the dis- course of the state. This period was marked by the construction of the forest as a solely economic entity, and policies with regard to forest management had a distinctly anthropomorphic bias. The need to maximise forest revenue led to the insti- tution of 'scientific foirstry' and the emergence of significant restrictions' on the customary activities of the villagers. Eventually, the alienation of villagers from the resources around them led to confron- tations between the community and the state and finally, in 1980, the imposition of a moratorium on the commercial felling of timber in Garhwal. The nature of the state-village relation- ship in the post-Chipko period has not been discussed in recent studies on Garhwal and Kumaon. The evidence on felling in Salang shows that since 1970, there has been a marked decline in commercial and state felling and an increase in the timber use of the local community. In the absence of direct appropriation of common re- sources by the state, I have argued that the everyday relation between the community and the state becomes important in the management of common resources. The moral economy and the existence of a region specific structure of monitoring costs influences the practices of the state func- tionaries, which are at considerable vari- ance with the formal structures of regu- lation. This variance, which from the formal point of view may be seen as an 'illegality', turns out to be an important way in which the state is experienced at the local level and comes to become a part of the moral economy of the local world. Finally, the case study of Udaara dem- onstrates how the nature of the hierarchy and the movement of authority away from local institutions adversely affect the management of common resources. In the post-Chipko environment, the pathways through which state rules affect the govern- ance of such resources and the incentives of individuals have gained in importance. As such, this study is a step towards delineating the parameters that affect household decisions towards common resources in the Himalayan region. l3 Notes [I would like to thank Veena Das, R K Das, Carolina Sanchez and participants in the work- shop on Common Property, Delhi School of Economics for helpful comments.

The rationality of decisions in these cases have to be viewed as contingent upon information available. 3 This may be considered an extension of the conflict between anthropomorphic and eco- centric views of the environment. One possible criteria for preservation could be that the beneficiaries have to compensate the losers- preservation occurs only if the gain to the beneficiaries is at least as much as the loss to the losers. However, such a solution could be highly inefficient if there is considerable uncertainty regarding the causal relationship . between strategy and outcome. Several authors have highlighted precisely this problem and argued that a definitive compensation criteria is impossible to establish. 4 This section is based on working plans of the Uttarkashi division and records of forest revenue and feliing in Bhatwari and Uttarkashi. 5 Bukki is the neighbouring village, and together with Salang forms a single forest 'beat'. 6 Computed from individual compartment histories, available with author. 7 Note that the periods do not cover the same number of years, the second period is 15 years, while the first is only 10. 8 I do not argue that all survival activities remained unrestricted; as I show later in the paper, timber grants became insufficient to meet survival requirements. Instead, I contend that the recognition of survival needs in the official discourse coupled with the development of an everyday 'moral' economy and high monitoring costs meant that most survival needs were met by the community. 9 It is important to note that all forest chowkidars are from the same region as the villagers. Hence familial and residential ties probably impose a greater moral sanction on theWvorking of the department. 10 Interview with villager. 11 See Section III. 12 Note that in the context of a labour shortage economy, such a strategy became viable due to the emergence of outside employment opportunities and the subsequent development of a localised labour market for grass. 13 One possible example of 'punishment' costs of enforcement. 14 These rights and concessions are for the Taknore division of Tehri, which Salang was a' part of.
