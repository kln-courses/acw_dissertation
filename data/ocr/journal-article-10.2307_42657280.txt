Schliemann and W. Dörpfeld. It briefly presents the complicated history and partition of duplicate artefacts from the Berlin collection and their donation to many European institutions after Schliemann's death. The article discusses five such collections in modern-day Poland. Schmidt's 1902 Berlin catalogue gives an overview of what types of object were sent to which institution, but gives no clear indication of the quantities involved. The present article tries to rectify that, and to present the information systematically institution by institution, with later documentation where available. Özet Bu makalede, H. Schliemann ve W. Dörpfeld tarafindan Troya'da gün i§igina çikarilmiç ancak önemi anlaçilamamiç bazi Tunç Çagi buluntulari üzerinde çaliçilmaktadir. Kisaca, Schliemann'in ölümünden sonra Berlin koleksiyonunda bulunan bazi eserlerin kopyalannin birçok Avrupa kurumuna dagitilmasi ve bagiçlanmasini kapsayan karma§ik bir tarih sunulmaktadir. Bu makalede, günümüz Polonya'sinda bulunan bu türdeki be§ koleksiyondan bahsedilmektedir. Schmidťin 1902 Berlin katalogu ne tür objelerin hangi kurumlara gönderildigi hakkinda genel bir bilgi vermektedir, ancak sayilan hakkinda net bilgiler bulunmamaktadir. Bu çaliçmayla, bu durumun düzeltilmesine ve ulaçilabilinen daha geç tarihli belgeler araciligiyla, her bir kurum için sistematik bilgi verilmesine çaliçilmiçtir. The logical 2006 Museum exhibition in on Warsaw Troy at (Pañstwowe the State Archaeo- Muzeum logical Museum in Warsaw (Pañstwowe Muzeum Archeologiczne) (Brzeziñski 2006), despite the errors of its catalogue (Maliszewski 2009a: 197-216, but on p. 205 read 'maja' instead of 'marca'; 2009b), including no mention of the Poznan collection (Maliszewski 1997: a preliminary publication; 2009a: 209; 2010), inspired me to present all the assemblages of Trojan artefacts donated at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries to various institutions in German towns, as well as Polish ones that at that time were under German and Russian occupation; since 1945 they have all been within Poland. The excavations of Hisarlik conducted by H. Schliemann between 1870 and 1890 (with breaks) and by W. Dörpfeld in 1893-1894 brought to light artefacts of many classes of materials, which were subsequently transferred to Europe (Maliszewski 2010: 71-74). The last shipment consisted of pottery sherds and stone implements derived from the fieldwork of Dörpfeld (Schmidt 1902: IV; Bertram 1992: 43; Saherwala et al. 1993: 46). In 1896 the collection from Troy numbered 8,455 artefacts, excluding 'Priam's Treasure' (Saherwala 1981: 43; Saherwala et al. 1993: 46). Among the mass of material transported from London, Istanbul and Athens to Berlin were certainly items discussed in this article. Subsequently, some of the antiquities held in Berlin were shared with institutions in many towns across the German Reich. It is worth noting that the idea of identifying and distributing duplicate artefacts had been presented to Schliemann by R. Schöne, Director of the King's Museums in Berlin. He was one of the first scholars to realise the importance of the Trojan artefacts for compa- rative studies. In his letter of 8 July 1889 to Schliemann, he expressed these ideas and mentioned as destinations Munich, Karlsruhe, Dresden, Leipzig, Bonn, Getting and Breslau. Schöne also suggested partitioning of the anti- quities held at Schliemann's house in Athens (Saherwala et al. 1993: 48, 216). Moreover, R. Virchow - an eminent German doctor, anthropologist, pathologist, hygienist and politician - in a letter of 11 May 1894, 61</page><page sequence="2">Anatolian Studies 2012 informed Schöne that Schliemann had reacted positively to his frequently suggested idea of distributing duplicate artefacts. Another step forward was made by Dörpfeld, who advised Schliemann to change his will in order to authorise the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin to share duplicates with other German museums. His endeavours come to light in a letter of 2 June 1890 to G. Treu, with whom he discussed the donation of Trojan finds to Dresden (Saherwala et al. 1993: 48). Officially, as early as 1893 A. Michaelis, from 1872 Professor of Archae- ology at the University of Strasburg, was the first to encourage the authorities' interest in the duplicates, namely the Ministry of Religious, Education and Medical Affairs in Strasburg (Schmidt 1902: VI). Other early efforts were initiated by Chlodwig Prince of Hohenlohe- Schillingsfürst, the Governor of Alsace-Lorraine and later Chancellor of the German Reich, who at the beginning of 1894 requested from R. Bose, the Minister of Culture, a donation of unneeded Trojan objects to other state collec- tions, including that of the University of Strasburg. Schliemann did not change his will, but he encouraged the donation of duplicates from Berlin after his death (Saherwala et al. 1993: 119-20). In fact, we owe the donations to his wife Sofia, who, nearly four years after her husband's death, on 18 July 1894, agreed to the selection of duplicate artefacts. In April 1895 the work finally began thanks to the good will of Schliemann's heirs and Emperor Wilhelm II's order of 7 January of the same year. The most important task was the cataloguing of finds, which had been initiated in 1882, continued in 1883 and was finally completed by H. Schmidt (Schmidt 1902: VI-VII, XII-XIII; Saherwala et al. 1993: 48). Also, the need to reorganise the somewhat old-fashioned display of the collection soon became apparent. In view of the results of new discoveries at Troy in 1893-1894, the display was outdated and inconsistent with the new findings. These reorganising efforts were completed in the years 1895-1900 and included the selection of duplicate artefacts. In 1902 the very impressive results of this enterprise appeared in the form of a catalogue (Schmidt 1902), which became and remains to this today an extremely valuable reference work. In short, the collection was divided into four sections (pottery, spindle whorls, 'treasure' finds and artefacts of various function made of different raw materials). All the artefacts were catalogued and 9,704 duplicates were separated from the central collection. In 1902 the dupli- cates (7,487 pottery vessels and fragments, whorls and single finds) and 38 cases of unregistered items were donated to 16 museums, 20 universities and academies, as well as an institute in Germany and one in Greece (Schmidt 1902: VI-XVIII, 331-36; Bertram 1992: 44). It should be added that not all the artefacts were transferred at the same time, since, for instance, already in 1901 duplicates had reached Tubing (Von Freytag-Löringhoff, Mannsperger 1991) but the National Museum in Athens did not receive the Trojan finds (as part of an exchange) until 1904 (Bertram 1992: 44). The donation of Trojan duplicate artefacts was clearly a centrally-planned initiative, which enormously enriched the collections of many institutions with finds from the site with far-reaching implications for European culture. In the cases of Braniewo (German Braunsberg), Gdansk (German Danzig), Poznaň (German Posen) and Wroclaw (German Breslau) it added to the prestige of the collec- tions in the eastern borderland of the German Reich. Independently, Trojan pottery fragments reached Warsaw, which at the end of the 19th century was still under Russian occupation, in quite different circumstances. Namely, we owe their arrival in Warsaw to the activity of E. Majewski, an eminent Polish archaeologist and collector. Finally, it should be mentioned that towards the end of World War II a portion of the Berlin archaeological collection, perhaps including Trojan antiquities, was hidden in the palace grounds of Pierusza (German Peruscher), now in the Wroclaw province of Poland. At the end of 1986 this hiding place was found, but sub- sequent excavations and studies did not record Trojan artefacts among other ceramic fragments (Szymkiewicz 1991: 26). However, at that time there was no one in Poland, and thus among the individuals who examined the finds from Pierusza, specialised in Trojan archaeo- logical materials. Braniewo The collection of Mediterranean antiquities in Braniewo had a very long tradition (Weißbrodt 1892; Faensen 2000). The 1914 inventory listed 1,250-1,300 items. This included c. 550 gypsum copies of Greek and Roman, but also Assyrian and Egyptian, sculptures. The core of the assemblage, however, consisted mainly of Greek and Roman antiquities, and also some Egyptian examples. At the Archaeological Museum, which was established in 1927, before World War II items were displayed in Room I (Oriental and Cretan-Minoan art), Room II (inscrip- tions), Room III (Greek art) and Room IV (Hellenistic and Roman art) (Faensen 2000: 69-80). Trojan duplicate artefacts were handed over to Braniewo in 1902 (Schmidt 1902: 331-36), and perhaps at least some of them were exhibited in Room I. However, the prehistoric assemblage sat outside the principal area of interest, which was focused mainly on Greek and Roman antiquities. As a consequence, the Trojan finds were not subject to any studies or even detailed references (Faensen 2000: 76). In light of this, it 62</page><page sequence="3">Maliszewski seems worth recalling and recording the evidence for the Trojan collection. This was kept at the Archaeological Museum, which was, in turn, totally destroyed during the bombardment of Braniewo in February and March 1945 (Faensen 2000: 82). The collection contained at least 62 items, if only one artefact from each of Schmidt's groups was donated to Braniewo (for a specification of these groups, see table 1; Schmidt 1902: 331-36). Unfortunately, the precise number cannot be given, but certainly there were many more objects. This is clear since in eight cases we are dealing with many more duplicate artefacts than benefiting institutions: numbers 901-28 ('Tellers'), 958- 97 ('Bechers'), 4103-495, 4496-5607 ('Wirteln'), 5619- 637 ('durchlochte Gefassscherben'), 8616-19 ('Sägen, Messer, Schaber oder Abfallsplitter'), 8684-764 ('Polier- steine'), 9203-47 ('Klopfsteine'). Within the collection, pottery (37 groups), whorls (two groups), pierced pottery sherds (one group), loom-weights (one group), various terracotta items (three groups; decorated balls and perhaps loom-weights), fragments of clay bricks (one group), marble idols (two groups), stone tools (14 groups) and bronze pins (one group) are recognisable. Poznan The assemblage of Trojan antiquities donated in 1902 to the Provincial Museum in Poznaň has been the focus of very detailed and comprehensive studies (Maliszewski 2010). Therefore, here it is necessary to mention briefly only that it included pottery (eight groups), undecorated spindle whorls (one group), pierced pottery sherds (one group), loom-weights (one group) and other clay items (one group). Moreover, there were various types of stone tools (12 groups), as well as some bronze pins (one group), marble idols (one group) and stone weights (one group) (Schmidt 1902: 33 1-36; for a specification of these groups, see Maliszewski 2010: 89, table 4).

Trojan artefacts donated to Braniewo. The number of institutions includes that of Braniewo 64</page><page sequence="5">Maliszewski the collection, but duplicate artefacts from 27 groups were handed over. Presently there are 30 ceramic artefacts from the Trojan collection at the National Museum in Poznaň, namely four vessels, one lid, 22 whorls, two pierced pottery disc sherds and one terracotta loom-weight. In light of this, it is clear that more than one duplicate from one or more of the groups was donated (i.e., the entire collection initially consisted of more than 27 artefacts). There were several groups for which the number of duplicate artefacts greatly exceeded the number of institu- tions, for instance numbers 891-900 ('Tellers'), 958-97 ('Bechers'), 4103^95 ('Wirteln'), 5619-37 ('durchlochte Gefássscherben'), 7438-512 ('Idole'), 8616-19 ('Sägen, Messer, Schaber oder Abfallsplitter'), 8684-764 ('Polier- steine'), 9162-202 ('Mahlsteine'). The present collection has been diminished by several important classes of artefacts, because no bronze needles, marble idols, clay items, stone net-weights, or ground and chipped stone implements have survived. Moreover, only five of the original eight pottery forms can be recorded today. This is the largest assemblage of Aegean items in Poland, and, despite its complicated history and severe losses, it has been displayed several times in Poznan: in 1947-1948 at the Museum of Great Poland, in 1983- 1984 at the National Museum and from 1988-2004 five items were exhibited at Gohichów Castle, a branch of the latter museum (Maliszewski 2010: 92). Wroclaw In 1902 at least 64 Trojan duplicate artefacts enriched the collection of the Universitas litterarum Wratislaviensis in Breslau founded in 1811, renamed in 1911 the Silesian Frederick- William University in Breslau (Schmidt 1902: 331-36; Kulak et al. 2002: 41-42, 95), but, as in Braniewo and Poznan, many more may have been donated. This can be deduced from the ratio of the number of donated artefacts to the number of institutions (table 2). This is notable in the group numbers 2701-22 ('Tassen'), 901-28 ('Tellers'), 958-97, 1097-128 ('Bechers'), 1139-55 ('Kannen'), 4103-495, 4496-5607 ('Wirteln'), 5619-37 ('durchlochte Gefássscherben'), 7438-512 ('Idole'), 8616-19 ('Sägen, Messer, Schaber oder Abfallsplitter'), 8684-764 ('Poliersteine'), 8870- 908 ('Thonkugeln'), 9162-202 ('Mahlsteine'), 9203-47 ('Klopfsteine'). The collection consisted mainly of pottery (38 groups), whorls (two groups), pierced pottery sherds (one group), bronze pins (one group), marble idols (one group), loom-weights (one group), terracotta items (three groups; rolls and perhaps loom-weights), stone tools (16 groups) and fragments of clay bricks (one group). Wroclaw, as a German fortress, was almost totally destroyed during World War II, and, as a conse- quence, it seems that none of these items survived the war. Gdansk At least one fragment of a Trojan anthropomorphic vessel was donated in 1902 to the West Prussian Provincial Museum in Gdansk (table 3; Schmidt 1902: 331-32). It should be mentioned that in the main Troy collection there was only one complete anthropomorphic artefact in terms of fabric and decoration, described in some detail by Schmidt (Schmidt 1902: 47). Thus, perhaps all dupli- cates, including this handmade 'Halsstück' from Gdansk, were very similar to that item. If so, this would help to date the Gdansk duplicate roughly to the Early Bronze Age Troy II- III. Due to the high level of destruction in Gdaňsk during World War II there is no available infor- mation concerning the vessel's fate after 1945. According to the lists arranged for these four collections (tables 1-3; Maliszewski 2010: 89, table 4), in many cases there were more duplicates available than benefiting institutions, and therefore they might have received more than one example of each. On the other hand, there are groups without duplicates or with fewer examples than the number of institutions. This additionally complicates attempts to reconstruct the size of each collection. Furthermore, it seems that items from the main groups and/or unregistered ones from the previ- ously-mentioned 38 cases of unregistered items may have been handed over. In light of all this, the precise number of artefacts donated to these four cities cannot be specified. Warsaw The State Archaeological Museum in Warsaw possesses a Trojan assemblage thanks to E. Majewski, who, during a visit to Berlin in the middle of September 1897, received from A. Voss, Director of the Prehistoric Department of the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin, 32 sherds (Katalog: 17), possibly in exchange for the assemblage of Palae- olithic tools from Brzozówka in the administrative district of Busk (Majewski [no date]). Moreover, on another visit to Berlin on 17 September 1902 Majewski perhaps bought or ordered ten replicas of Trojan vessels (Majewski [no date]). Both sherds and copies were kept originally at the Museum of Erazm Majewski, but were later handed over to the State Archaeological Museum in Warsaw which was founded in 1928 (Krajewska 2009: 6- 7). Unfortunately, the pottery fragments have been only very tentatively published (Guzowska 2006; contra Maliszewski 2009a: 208-10). Despite this, it seems possible to distinguish five open and two closed forms. On the other hand, there are at least 14 sherds which require detailed typological studies; however, this task requires the expertise of someone very experienced in Trojan pottery. 65</page><page sequence="6">Anatolian Studies 2012 Schmidt 1902 Cat. nos Number of Number of Number of Pages (groups) Type items duplicates institutions 12-13, 331 274-80 'halbförmiges ... kugelförmiges Gefásse ' 7 6 9 16, 331 331-39 'Flachdeckel der Gesichtsvase ... mit zipfel-artigen 9 9 9 Griffen' 17.331 373 'Halsstück mit Henkel von einer Kanne' 12 3 23-24, 33 1 469-74 ' Stülpdeckel zur Deckelamphora ... mit dreiteiligem 6 11 11 Bügelgriff' 28-30,331 561-79 'Schnurösenflaschen' 19 6 6 37.332 677-87 'Tassen mit ... ausladendem Rande' 11 43 33 37, 332 691-700 'Tassen mit 2 Henkeln und . . . hohlem Fusse' 10 25 23 37-38, 332 715-19 'Tassen mit kleinem Dreifuss u. 2 Henkeln' 5 5 4 44-45, 332 891-900 'Teller' 10 36 30 45, 332 901-28 'Teller' 28 82 30 45,332 958-97 'hoche Becher mit einem Henkel' 40 169 35 46,332 1021-26 'doppelhenklige Krüge' 6 6 6 49, 332 1070-74 'Gesichtsvase' 5 7 8 51,332 1097-128 'Becher, wie No. 958 ff.' 32 40 25 51,332 1139-55 'Kannen' 17 34 25 52,332 1162-63 'Schalen' 2 1 1 54,332 1220-30 'einhenklige Kannen' 11 16 16 58.332 1330-46 'Halsstücke von Kannen mit blattförmiger Mündung' 17 13 12 61.333 1407-08 'glockenförmige Becher mit niedrigen Fuss' 2 2 2 67,333 1526-27 'enghalsige Kannen mit blattförmige Mündung' 2 2 6 71, 333 1602-23 'Tassen, einhenklig' 22 29 24 71,333 1626-34 'Tassen ... doppelhenklig' 9 28 30 71, 333 1635-52 'Tassen, einhenklig ... mit 2 Henkeln' 18 35 26 75,333 1811-21 'doppelhenklinge Becher' 11 26 22 126-27,333 2474-84 'Krüge' 11 15 16 135-36, 333 2573-76 'Schnurösengefasse, flaschenartig' 4 9 9 137.333 2605-08 'Kannen, kugelbauchig' 4 17 18 137.334 2622-26 'enghalsige Kannen, kugelbauchig' 5 9 9 138,334 2645-70 'Kännchen' 26 31 24 139,334 2683-87 'einhenklige Becher' 5 6 6 140, 334 2698-99 'doppelhenklige Becher' 2 5 6 140, 334 2701-22 'Tassen, einhenklig' 22 44 26 140, 334 2725-30 'Näpfe' 6-6 140, 334 2749-56 'flaschenartige Gefásse' 8 8 8 143, 334 2813-16 'Schnurösenkrüge' 4 3 3 143, 334 2832-35 'Krüge' 4 5 6 144, 334 2888-99 'Miniatur-Kännchen' 12 17 23 147-63,334 2997-3367 'Bruchstücke von Schnurösen Gefassen; Kannen, 71 - 24 Teller, Schüsseln, Schalen, Depas amphikypellon, Tassen, Flasche, Amphoren, Mischgefasse, Kessel, Untersätze, Verschiedenes, Tierköpfe als Gefassansätze, ornamentierte Bruchstücke' Table 2.

Trojan artefacts donated to Gdansk. The number of institutions includes that of Gdansk Conclusion According to the records of Schmidt and Majewski, these five institutions received at least 189 artefacts, but it seems that only the Warsaw collection and part of the Poznaň assemblage have survived. The donated objects were mainly simple, utilitarian items (ceramics, artefacts made of stone, a few of metal) useful in everyday life. Moreover, worthy of particular note are the marble idols (Maliszewski 1989; 1993), good examples of the spiritual life of the Trojans. Within the collections, ceramics constitute the largest group of artefacts, including pottery along with spinning and weaving implements (whorls, loom-weights). Nevertheless, pottery predominates, and there are four recognisable functional categories, namely vessels for eating, drinking, pouring and storage, plus miscellaneous items. 67</page><page sequence="8">Anatolian Studies 2012 Bibliography Bertram, M. 1992: 'Geschichte der Schliemann- Sammlung' in W.
