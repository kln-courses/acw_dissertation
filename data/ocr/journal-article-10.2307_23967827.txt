University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1996. isbn ο 271 01540 3. $40.00/£33.95. The new Schleiermacher Kritische Gesamtausgabe has both com pelled and enabled reinterpretation of Schleiermacher's thought. It has compelled reinterpretation by exposing many common read ings as untenable and has enabled it by providing for the first time full and critically edited versions of many unpublished texts that were previously inaccessible or thought to be lost (JTS, ns 39/1 (1988), pp. 317-25). Over the past twenty years, Schleiermacher research has become a major growth industry in Germany, surpassing the famous 'Schleiermacher renaissance' at the beginning of the previous century. New monographs appear almost by the month, some of the best being included in the Schleiermacher-ArchivSchleiermacher-Archiv series published by de Gruyter. This new wave has taken some time to reach American shores. Julia Lamm's study of Schleiermacher's theological appropriation of Spinoza is one of the first monographs in English to have taken full advantage of the KGA. The Living God is at least the equal of the best examples of recent German scholarship. Schleiermacher was hounded by the charge of being a 'Spinozist' from the time he became known as the author of the RedenReden liber die Religion (first published in 1799) to the final edition of his Glaubenslehre in 1830-1. Schleiermacher was by no means the first German public figure to have been accused of 'Spinozism' or 'pantheism' by his enemies and by some of his friends in an age when that charge was tantamount to being called an 'atheist'. Leibniz had perhaps been the first major figure to have to defend himself against such a charge, but the accusation was at the centre of the Pantheismusstreit that swirled in German circles after the death of Lessing. The young Schleiermacher and others of his generation (including Herder) became as a result fascinated with Spinoza's thought—though his 'Spinoza' was neither just the his torical Spinoza of Amsterdam nor quite the 'Spinoza' invented by the young German Romantics. His 'Spinoza' was in fact not</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 387 that far from his 'Kant' (cf. KGA, 1/1, pp. 526f.), so that he could regard them as complementary thinkers (cf. 1/1, pp. 573-7). This idiosyncratic view is sufficient to suggest the degree of difficulty faced by anyone who would explain 'Schleiermacher's theological appropriation of Spinoza'. Another difficulty arises from the fact that, apart from his notebooks, Schleiermacher almost nowhere refers to Spinoza or to his ideas. He mentions his name but once in the Reden, and not at all in the Glaubenslehre. Even so, the charge of Schleiermacher's being a 'Spinozist' has persisted. In The Living God, Dr Lamm attempts to sort out precisely how Schleiermacher understood and appropriated Spinoza and how this may or may not have had an impact on his formulation of Christian doctrines, especially the doctrine of God in the Glaubenslehre.Glaubenslehre. She argues that his concept of 'a living God' shows traces of Schleiermacher's appropriation of Spinoza, but that it is not a 'Spinozist' doctrine. The way it is elaborated in the Glaubenslehre Glaubenslehre avoids both the Scylla and Charybdis of 'pantheism' and 'anthropomorphism'. This is not a novel claim. Schleiermacher claimed something similar. What is original is the clarity, sensitivity and precision of her analysis. Dr Lamm builds her case by attending carefully to the emer gence and modification of what she has aptly named Schleiermacher's 'post-Kantian Spinozism' (which includes just a dash of Plato for seasoning). She focuses first on what can be gleaned from young Schleiermacher's notebooks, from successive editions of the Reden (especially the 'explanations' added to the third edition of 1821), and the two editions of Der christliche Glaube.Glaube. The final two chapters examine carefully the structure of the second edition in an effort to determine the rationale for Schleiermacher's doctrine of the 'living God'. The The Living God shows Julia Lamm to be fully in control of her material, with the result that she is able to achieve insights and to make observations about the subtle interplay of method and content in Schleiermacher's theological project. This enables her more precisely to 'locate' the place of the doctrine of God in the scheme of the Glaubenslehre and to show why God must have intentionality and possess wisdom and love in order to satisfy the needs of Schleiermacher's schema. The 'living God' in Schleiermacher's schema arises out of an analysis of the indi vidual's relation to God. The base experience of God in that schema is 'the experience of having been redeemed through the communication and impartation of the divine love'. Neither Spinoza's natura naturans nor Jacobi's anthropomorphic God is</page><page sequence="3">388 REVIEWS adequate to that experience.
