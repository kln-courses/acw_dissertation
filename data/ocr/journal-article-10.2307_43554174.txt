They are based on data from pollen analyses of lakes and peat-bogs, plant macrofossils, ar- chaeobotanical finds and radiocarbon dating. During the early Holocene, after 7900 cal. b.p. (5950 cal. b.c.) the climate changed to cooler summers, milder winters and higher precipitation resulting in the formation of a conif- erous belt dominated by Pinus sp. and Abies alba. These favorable environmental pre-conditions had a positive influence on the Neolithisation of the Balkans after the 8200 cal. b.p. (6250 cal. b.c.) cold event, which caused drought in the Eastern Mediterranean. Direct evidence from wood charcoal records from the Neolithic settlement layers in the study area shows a slight modification of the surrounding woodlands and an increase of the light- Communicated by W.

The increase in the number of settlements in the valleys of southwestern Bulgaria intensified the human activity visi- ble in the palaeobotanical record from 6950 cal. b.p. (5000 cal. b.c.) onwards. Between ca. 5700-5100 cal. b.p. (3800-3200 cal. b.c.) signs of anthropogenic influence on the vegetation are virtually absent. The intensity of human impact increased notably after 3200 cal. b.p. (1400-1250 cal. b.c., approx. Late Bronze Age), doc- umented by a rise of pollen anthropogenic indicators. The final transformations in the natural forest cover after 2750 cal. b.p. (800 cal. b.c. onset of the Iron Age) marked the reduction of the coniferous forests dominated by Abies alba and Pinus sp. and the expansion of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies. These vegetation changes are contempo- raneous with increase of the palaeofire activities and the next peak of anthropogenic indicators. The changes in the landscape during the Roman period and the medieval period reflect regional environmental features and were forced by the diversification of anthropogenic activity.

Springer</page><page sequence="2">414 Veget Hist Archaeobot (2012) 21:413-427 Southwestern Bulgaria is of special interest for studies on this topic as its natural vegetation has been influenced by anthropogenic activity since at least 8,500 years ago, starting with the introduction of Neolithic farming and continuously increasing through millennia of human occupation. The area is considered as one of the routes for the Neolithisation of southeastern Europe, playing a key role in the prehistory of the region because of its special geographic position linked with the Aegean in the south, the Thracian plain to the east and the Danube valley to the north. This position of the study area makes it very suitable for tracing out various regional land use developments and influences on the vegetation. Its natural conditions have a transitional character from Mediterranean to continental climate and vegetation, and could be crucial for under- standing the linkage between the near-eastern and Euro- pean land use practices. The main periods of human occupation in the region, if considered against the background of the main palaeocli- matic events during the Holocene, show certain parallels and relationships (for discussion of some of them see Weninger et al. 2009). The Neolithisation in the study area was preceded by the 8200 cal. b.p. (ca. 6200 cal. b.c.) cooling event which influenced the environment and human occupation in the study area (Weninger et al. 2006). Another period of importance is the end of the Holocene climatic optimum, which can be roughly associated with Bond cycle 4: 5400-4800 cal. b.p. (3450-2850 cal. b.c.) (Bond et al. 2001) and which is more or less contemporary with the transitional period between the end of the Chal- colithic period in Bulgaria (ca. 3800-3500 cal. b.c.) and the onset of the Early Bronze Age (3000-2800 cal. b.c.) (Görsdorf and Boyadzhiev 1996). The climatic fluctuations that followed, considered as global, such as Bond Event 3 or the 4200 cal. b.p. (2250 cal. b.c.) event, correspond to the second half of the Early Bronze Age, which was a period of low settlement activity in the study area (Grębska-Kulowa and Kulow 2007). The evidence for the adjacent areas, such as the Aegean and Anatolia (Roberts et al. 2008, 2011), indicate aridity for this period. The rather arid period around 2850 cal. b.p. (900 cal. b.c., corresponding to Bond event 2), was contemporary with the Early Iron Age in the region. The last fairly well globally recorded palaeoclimatic event (Wanner et al. 2008) is the period of ca. 700-500 cal. b.p. (a.d. 1300-1500) corresponding to the Little Ice Age. In order to evaluate the degree of human impact in the region under consideration, a number of investigations combining pollen analysis, archaeobotanical studies, radiocarbon dating, and information on past climate changes were carried out over a period of 20 years. These studies focused on the introduction of agriculture, the practice of stock-breeding and the collection of plant Ö Springer material for various purposes, as well as the human-envi- ronment interactions (e.g. Popova and Bozhilova 1997; Marinova et al. 2002; Kreuz et al. 2005; Marinova 2006; Bozilova and Tonkov 2007; Marinova and Thiebault 2008; Marinova and Popova 2008). Since at present this information is spread over different publications and partly unpublished, this paper provides the first comprehensive overview and critical evaluation of past vegetation changes in relation to human occupation for the region. As such, it presents evidence on the long term development of the human landscapes in southwestern Bulgaria during the Holocene. The main sources of infor- mation for this study are the palynological and anthraco- logical data from south western Bulgaria. Together with this some relevant archaeobotanical information on seed/ fruit remains of crops and weeds is also taken into con- sideration. Possible interpretations for natural and anthro- pogenic landscape changes are discussed, and the most important stages of these changes are defined. The emphasis will finally be put into a regional context, by comparison with data from the adjacent areas. Study area The study area is situated in southeastern Europe and can be divided in two sub-regions corresponding to the main geographical features of southwestern Bulgaria: (1) the Upper and Middle-Struma river valley and its adjoining slopes, and (2) the mountain areas; to the east of the valley the Rila and Pirin mountains, and to the west several smaller mountain ranges (Konjavska, Osogovo and Maleshevska). The locations of the palynological and archaeological sites considered here are shown in Fig. 1. Natural environment The climate in the study area, especially its southern part, is under the influence of the Mediterranean, while more con- tinental conditions prevail further north. In general, it can be considered as being transitional between continental and sub-Mediterranean climate. The mean annual temperature in the lowlands varies from 14°C in the south to 10°C in the north. The annual precipitation in the lowlands is from 780 mm in the south to ca. 600 mm in the north. Above 1,000 m the climate changes to mountainous and the mean temperature drops by 0.5°C with each 100 m increase in altitude. The mean annual precipitation is 800-1,000 mm, much of it snow at higher altitudes (Kopralev 2002). According to Velchev (2002) the natural vegetation in the lowlands of the study area (up to 900 m) is composed of xerothermic and xeromesophilous oak and hornbeam forests dominated by Quercus cerris, Q. pubescens , Q. fraine tto, Q. dalechampii, Carpinus orientalis and C.</page><page sequence="3">Veget Hist Archaeobot (2012) 21:413-427 415 Fig. 1 a Overview map with the study area indicated by a hatched rectangle, b Detailed map showing the palynological sites under consideration, the three additionally included in the summary given in Fig. 4, and the archaeological sites; KON Konjavska Mountain, OS Osogovo Mountain, MAL Maleshevska Mountain.

The sub-Mediterranean floristic elements in these forests increase from north to south. Today human impact has turned many of those forests into secondary communities dominated by sub- Mediterranean species like Carpinus orientalis and Paliu- rus spina-christi, and partly by Juniperus oxycedrus , Phillyrea latifolia , Quercus coccifera und Pistacia tere- binthus. The open habitats created by anthropogenic activities are usually dominated by xerophylous shrubs and herbs mainly of a sub-Mediterranean or steppe character such as Genista rumelica, Astragalua angustifolius , Amy- gdalus nana , Artemisia alba , Agropyron brandsae etc. (Bondev 1991). In the mountain ranges to the west of the Struma valley the zone between 1,000 and 1,600 m a.s.1. is dominated by forests of Fagus sylvatica while in the Rila and Pirin mountains above 1,500 m a coniferous belt exists domi- nated by Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Pinus peuce. The subalpine area (2,000-2,400 m) in the Rila and Pirin mountains is dominated by a thick, impenetrable formation of Pinus mugo with Juniperus sibirica and Vaccinium myrtìllus. Above it the alpine area is occupied by various herb communities. Archaeological background The development of the prehistoric cultures in southwestern Bulgaria, and particularly along the Struma valley, is a key question in Balkan prehistory. The direct territorial con- nection of this region with the northern Aegean coast, and from there with Anatolia, influenced the specific dynamics of cultural changes through all prehistoric periods (Perni- che va 1995; Nikolov 2007). The Struma valley is consid- ered as one of the primary routes for the Neolithisation of the Balkan Peninsula (Lichardus-Itten et al. 2006) which according to the available archaeological evidence and radiocarbon dates started around 6200/6100 cal. b.c. (Görsdorf and Bojadziev 1996; Boyadzhiev 2009). The Early Neolithic settlements were situated in the foothills of the mountains, between 400 and 650 m. Quite probably their location reflects favorable climatic and ecological conditions (Todorova and Vaisov 1989). An increase in the number of prehistoric settlements is observed during the Neolithic with a maximum around the last quarter of the 6th millennium b.c. (Grębska-Kulowa and Kulow 2007). Dur- ing the second half of the Late Neolithic (5200-4900 cal. b.c.) new, larger settlements with surface areas of up to 16 ha were founded. The number of the settlements increased considerably during this period, indicating a strong increase in the population (Grçbska-Kulova 2005). By the end of the Late Neolithic and the beginning of the Early Chalcolithic (4900-4850 cal. b.c.) the number of settlements was decreasing and this also continued during the Early Bronze Age (3200-2500 cal. b.c.). The settle- ments were of limited size and were usually surrounded with palisades or stone walls. This resulted in a chain of protected sites in the Struma valley. A second maximum in the settlement activities in the area was observed during the Late Bronze Age (1400-1200 cal. b.c.) (Grębska-Kulowa and Kulow 2007). Between the Early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Late Bronze Age there is a chronological hiatus of about 600 years from which no particular sites and cultural content have yet been found (Boyadzhiev 2007). Subsequently, settlements were founded in the lower parts of the Struma valley, near the river, only during the Late Iron Age probably as a result of the increase in pop- ulation. During the 6th and in the first half of the 5th century b.c. the broader geographical area around the lower Springer</page><page sequence="4">416 Veget Hist Archaeobot (2012) 21:413-427 courses of the Mesta (Nestos), Struma (Strymon) and Vardar (Axios) rivers experienced remarkable economi- cal, political and cultural prosperity. During the 5th-4th century b.c. the area was integrated in the Kingdom of Macedonia, and later on, in the 1st century a.d. it became part of the Roman Empire (Delev 2002). Of importance for the land use strategies is also the fact that woodland-con- suming iron production was practiced on a large scale in the mountainous area between the rivers Mesta and Struma during the Medieval. Recent surveys (Athanassov et al. 2010) have found iron slag on numerous sites in the area since from even Late Antiquity. In general, the study area was also involved in transhumance at least from the Late Bronze Age (Leshtakov 2006) until the First World War. This should also be considered when interpreting the pal- aeoecological evidence for the past landscapes. Materials and methods The evidence used for this study was taken first from several palynological profiles considered most appropriate due to their relatively good chronological framework and location. These data [summarized in Fig. 2 and ESM (Electronic Supplementary Material) Figs 1-5] were com- bined with anthracological evidence gathered from archaeological sites (Fig. 3). The combination and com- parison of data coming from natural sediments (pollen) and anthropogenic layers (wood charcoals) allow the creation of a more detailed and complete picture of the past anthropogenic changes in the vegetation. Moreover, in interpreting the palynological and anthracological data, the archaeobotanical evidence on the ancient agriculture and land use in the study area was also taken into consideration (see overview in Vaiamoti 2004; Borojevic 2006; Mari- nova 2006; Popova 2009). Finally, an attempt was made to correlate the palaeo- botanical evidence from the study area with information on global rapid climate changes as given by Mayewski et al. (2004), and with the available radiocarbon datasets and archaeological chronology provided by Chohadzhiev (2007), Görsdorf and Bojazhiev (1996), Vajsov (1998), Gatsov and Boyadziev (2009) and Stefanovich and Bankoff (1998). The correlation is presented in Fig. 4. Palynological data The palynological data used in this paper originate from investigations already published in Tonkov (1988, 2003), Tonkov et al. (2002, 2008) and Tonkov and Bozilova (1992a, b). Simplified percentage pollen diagrams with selected taxa of importance for the current study are given as ESM Figs 1-5.

For the majority of the pollen types the nomenclature of Beug (2004) was used. No hiatuses were detected in any of the pollen records. The age-depth models for each site are given in the corresponding pub- lication referred to above. In the most cases the radiocar- bon age control of the records is based on dating of bulk sediment except for the profile from Lake Ribno Band- erishko (Tonko v et al. 2002), where AMS-dating on ter- restrial plant macrofossils was applied. The lithological units for each of the records are represented in the corre- sponding diagrams (ESM Figs 1-5). The pollen source area for these palynological archives corresponds to small- medium size basins. As the sites are situated in montane areas transportation of pollen upslope from lower eleva- tions is also considered as shown by studies of surface moss samples from the region (Tonko v 2007). Palynological indicators for the interpretation of human impact on the vegetation in the study area In order to understand the nature and extent of human impact on the ancient vegetation and landscape, it is important to define the major indicators for anthropogenic impact. Based on the approach of Behre (1981), the pollen data information is evaluated with special emphasis on the anthropogenic impact on the landscape visible in the pal- aeoecological records. The primary anthropogenic indicators of cereal cultiva- tion such as Cerealia-type, Triticum- type, Hordeum- type, Avena- type and Secale are also used in the current study for estimation of changes in land use (Faegri and Iversen 1989). The methodological approach for the defining of pollen taxa as "secondary anthropogenic indicators" in the pollen dia- grams from Central Europe, the Mediterranean region and Greece has been discussed in detail (Behre 1981, 1988; Bottema 1982; Bottema and Woldring 1990). To a consid- erable extent these ideas were also applied to the pollen diagrams from Bulgaria (Bozilova and Tonkov 1990; Hutt- unen et al. 1992; Filipovich and Stefanova 1998; Lazarova 1995; Marinova and Atanassova 2006; Tonkov et al. 201 1). Special attention needs to be given to Cerealia-type as the pollen of several wild-growing grass taxa also shows the morphological features of this type (Beug 2004), which means that it does not necessarily come from cultivated fields, but could have originated from the local wild- growing vegetation. Hence, the records of this type should be considered more cautiously and only in connection with the other indicators for anthropogenic change and consid- ering both the local vegetation and the information on human occupation in the study area (for further discussion on the topic see Behre 2007, 2008). The same is true to great extent for Hordeum-iypt , Avena- type and Secale as wild- â Springer growing representatives of these types could also be found in southeastern Europe. The archaeobotanical evidence from the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age period (from ca. 5900 to 1200 cal b.c.) shows that the main cereal crops of importance for the study area (Popova and Mari- nova 2007) were hulled wheats ( Triticum monococcum and T. dicoccum ) and barley (. Hordeum vulgare). For this period Triticum-type could certainly be considered as a primary anthropogenic indicator, as the genus has no wild-growing representatives in the area under consideration. It is more difficult to consider Hordeum- type as a definite indicator of cultivation as several weedy and wild-growing species from the genus Hordeum occur in the study area. From the ar- chaeobotanical information from the region of south-east- ern Europe (Kroll 1991; Neef 2007; Popova 2009) it is known that cultivated rye {Secale cereale) gained impor- tance from the Late Roman period onwards, but had occurred as a weed since the Late Iron Age (6th-4th century b.c.). Considering this, Secale in the pollen diagrams found in sediments of earlier age than the Roman period is more likely to represent non-cultivated rye present as a weed or an element of the natural vegetation. Similarly for culti- vated oats (Avena sativa) no evidence exists for its culti- vation before the Roman age, but as a weed Avena sp. is known from the archaeobotanical record since the Late Bronze Age (Popova 2009). However the peaks of Horde- um- type, Avena- type and Secale should be attributed to anthropogenic activities, especially in connection with other evidence for cultivation and human impact. Another pollen type indicative of anthropogenic activi- ties is Agrostemma githago. However it can only really be used as an anthropogenic indicator from the Late Iron Age/ Roman Age onwards when this plant becomes a constant element of the weed flora of the study area (Popova 2009). The regular appearance of Juglans regia in Mid-Holocene pollen records (Tonkov and Bozilova 1992b; Tonkov et al. 2002) from the study area indicated that this tree should be considered as native for this part of the country. Consid- ering its more extensive occurrence after ca. 1400 cal. b.c. (corresponding to the Late Bronze Age) and the palynological evidence from adjacent regions (Bottema 1974, 2000; Jahns and Van den Bogaard 1998; Eastwood et al. 1998; Kaltenrieder et al. 2010) the pollen of Juglans regia could be interpreted as an indicator of anthropogenic activities from 1400 cal. b.c. onwards. The secondary anthropogenic indicators characteristic of the mountains in southwestern Bulgaria include Plantago lanceolata- type, Polygonum aviculare- type, Rumex , Scleranthus, Urtica , Cirsium- type and Juniperus. They reflect permanent human occupation - ruderalization and stock-breeding. Special attention is paid to Plantago lanceolata- type, as a taxon that apart from human activity in settlement areas also reflects livestock grazing in the</page><page sequence="7">Veget Hist Archaeobot (2012) 21:413-427 419 mountain meadows, but is also an important indicator of fallow land. Quite often after forest clearing the pollen curves of Poaceae, Artemisia , Chenopodiaceae, Plantago major/ media- type, Urtica and Cichorioideae ( Taraxacum - or, according to Beug 2004, Crépis- type) increase and by careful evaluation of the dating these can also be used as secondary indicators for interpretation of human impact. Some of the secondary anthropogenic indicators, for example Artemisia sp., Chenopodiaceae, Cichorioideae, Cirsium-type, Plantago major/media- type, Rume: c etc. were also elements of the natural open vegetation during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene and for these periods they are not considered to indicate human impact. When occurring in subsequent periods these taxa are considered as anthro- pogenic indicators mainly only if they show parallel peaks in the pollen diagrams or appear in combination with other primary evidence of human impact on the vegetation. Anthracological data Anthracological analysis permits the reconstruction of the surrounding vegetation in areas where there are no sedi- ments suitable for pollen analysis. In study areas where pollen bearing sediments near prehistoric sites have not yet been recovered, it allows the creation of a relatively good picture of the past vegetation and environments. Moreover, it represents the woodland used directly by the prehistoric population and allows the identification through wood charcoal macro remains of some taxa that could not be revealed by pollen analysis. The anthracological data used for the current study comes from several archaeological sites from the study area (Fig. 1), all of them situated in the lowlands of the region between ca. 200 and 700 m a.s.l. Together with the already published information on some of the sites (Marino va et al. 2002; Marinova and Thiebault 2008; Popova and Marinova 2007), additional information was used from samples from Kovacevo col- lected after 2003 and from further studies in the region (for the sites Balgarchevo, Slatina). The laboratory study was carried out on charcoal (&gt;2 mm) manually fractured in three anatomical planes (transversal, tangential and radial). The charcoal was examined with a reflected light microscope and counted. Specialized literature (Schweingruber 1990) and a refer- ence collection of modern wood samples were used for the identification. Studies on the sample size required for adequate reconstruction of woodland vegetation in the ar- chaeobotanical assemblages for the Western Mediterranean have shown that the best ca. 400-500 fragments per stratigraphie unit should be used (Chabal 1992). Thus for the sites in southeastern Europe, where the biodiversity is roughly comparable, at least 400 charcoal fragments per stratigraphie layer are needed. In the currently studied material this requirement is met by four of the total of six sites shown in Fig. 3. The counts of wood charcoal fragments identified for each site were made to calculate percentage proportions between the different vegetation types to which the char- coal taxa most probably belonged and are plotted in chronological order (Fig. 3). The classification of the different charcoal taxa to veg- etation types follows those already published and exten- sively discussed by Marinova and Thiebault (2008) and is based on the descriptions of the potential natural vegetation in the region given in Bondev (1991) and Bohn et al. (2000/2003). The type defined as "oak forests" includes the wood charcoal fragments identified as Quercus sp., Acer sp. and Carpinus sp. The group defined as "forest border/undergrowth" includes light-demanding taxa like Cornus sp., Cory lus avellana , Juniperus sp., Prunoideae, Pomoideae and Rosaceae. The group "pine forests" includes the wood charcoal identified as Pinus nigra/syl- vestris and coniferous, and finally taxa like Alnus sp., Fraxinus sp., Salix/Populus and Ulmus sp. are attributed to the group called "riparian woodland". Being aware that some of these taxa could occur in more than one of the groups defined by us, the decision was made to assign them to the most probable of them. Results Palynological evidence Several pollen diagrams from the mountains of south- western Bulgaria with relatively good chronological con- trol give information related to anthropogenic impact since the Neolithic. The correlation of the vegetation development with the palynological data for the region is given in Fig. 2. In the following section the anthropogenic impact on the vege- tation will be briefly presented against the background of the general vegetation development for the five selected palynological records. Lake Trilistnika , Northwestern Rila Mts., ESM Fig. 1 The pollen data span the Late Glacial and the entire Holocene (Tonkov et al. 2008). The palynological record provides some information on the anthropogenic impact. This is not rich bearing in mind the high elevation (2,216 m a.s.l.) of the site studied, but is of importance in tracing human influence in the higher mountain area and on a regional scale. â Springer</page><page sequence="8">420 Veget Hist Archaeobot (2012) 21:413-427 One of the most important environmental changes for the Holocene occurred at the transition of pollen zones LT-4 and LT-5 (ca. 5900 cal. b.c. corresponding to the Early Neo- lithic) when the deciduous Quercus- forests with Tilia , Ulmus and Corylus declined. Coniferous forests dominated by Pinus (P. sylvestris, P. peuce) and Abies alba developed at higher altitudes. The decrease in Betula pollen indicates that in many places birch forests gave way to coniferous vege- tation. The vertical migration of conifers like A. alba and P. peuce and the expansion of their areas was probably facili- tated by an increase in precipitation and humidity (Davis et al. 2003), taking place after soils with humic horizons had developed (Bennett and Willis 1995). By this time the first sporadic records of Plantago lanceolata- type had occurred. From 1400 cai. b.c. (Late Bronze Age) the continuous presence of pollen of Rumex and P. lanceolata- type begins and the first pollen grains of Juglans regia appear. The establishment of J. regia pollen and the presence of cereal pollen (Triticum-type, Secale) points to an expansion of agriculture and cultivation of walnut in the foothills of the mountains, whereas Rumex , P. lanceolata- type and Scleranthus pollen indicate livestock-grazing in the moun- tain meadows. Lake Ribno Banderishko, Northern Pirin Mts., ESM Fig. 2 The palynological data cover part of the Lateglacial and the entire Holocene (Tonkov et al. 2002). The site is situated at 2,190 m a.s.l. Comparable to the situation in the Rila Mts. at ca. 5900 cal. b.c. (Early Neolithic) important changes in the forest cover occurred. The mixed deciduous Quercus- forests with abundant Tilia, Ulmus and Corylus retreated and were replaced in many places by Carpinus orientalis/Ostrya carpini/olia, while further upslope communities of C. betu- lus developed. The favorable climatic and edaphic condi- tions triggered the formation of a coniferous belt dominated by Pinus sylvestris , P. peuce and A. alba. This is also the period when the first indications of human presence are recorded in the pollen diagram. The beginning of a contin- uous P. lanceolata- type pollen curve and the first appearance of Cerealia-type, P. major/media-type and Polygonum aviculare- type pollen is noteworthy. Later on, ca. 1000 cal. b.c., the uninterrupted presence of Scleranthus pollen begins. The most indicative signs of human impact were present after ca. 700 cal. b.c. with the continuous pollen curve of Cerealia-type and the regular presence of both J. regia and secondary anthropogenic pollen indicators. Peat bog Maleshevska Mts., ESM Fig. 3 The palynological record from this lower mountain, situ- ated in a western direction from the Struma river at about 1,700 m a.s.l., reveals the changes in the natural vegetation â Springer since 5500 cai. b.c. (Late Neolithic) (Tonkov and Bozilova 1992a). Three distinct periods are recognized in the pollen diagram. During the earliest period (5500-2760 cai. b.c., Middle/ Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age) forests of A. alba with an admixture of P. sylvestris and P. nigra dominated above 1,000-1,200 m thus shaping the upper tree-line for more than the next 3,000 years. The wide distribution of the conifers was favored by an increase in precipitation and humidity during the Holocene climatic optimum. Below the coniferous belt, mixed oak forests ( Quercetum mixtum) with abundant Tilia , Ulmus and Corylus avellana devel- oped. The presence of Cerealia-type pollen observed for the last quarter of the 6th millennium b.c. might reflect increasing settlement activity and, related to this, cereal cultivation in the Struma valley. During the next period (2760-800 cal. b.c., Early Bronze Age-Early Iron Age) a sharp decline in the areas occupied by Abies is observed around 2760 cal. b.c. Quite probably, this was caused by a decrease in humidity (roughly corresponding to Bond event 4) and was rein- forced by the intensification of human disturbance in all vegetation belts. By ca. 800 cal. b.c. beech forests replaced the conifers, shaping the present tree-line. The uninter- rupted presence of the anthropogenic pollen indicators (Cerealia-type, P. lanceolata- type, Rumex , Scleranthus) clearly indicates the practice of agriculture in the foothills of the mountain and extended sheep/goat and cattle- breeding in the lower mountain areas. The continuous presence of Juglans pollen dates back to the Early Bronze age. The last period (800 cal. b.c. - present) is characterized by a strong anthropogenic influence on the vegetation. At lower elevations the oak forests were anthropogenically disturbed and replaced by secondary communities domi- nated by Carpinus orientalis and Quercus pubescens , while at higher elevations beech forests replaced the conifers. Peat bog O so gov o Mts., ESM Fig. 4 The palynological data from this site provide a reliable basis for a palaeovegetation reconstruction for the last ca. 5,000 years (Tonkov 2003). The site is situated at 1,720 m a.s.l. and the oldest pollen spectra reflect a characteristic vegetation pattern dominated by Pinus sp. and Abies alba which lasted until ca. 200 cal. b.c. The broad-leaved vegetation distributed at lower altitudes was composed of Quercus sp., Carpinus betulus , Tilia sp. and Corylus avellana. The first indication of human presence is the appearance of the pollen curves of Rumex and P. lanceo- lata- type at ca. 1500 cal. b.c. (transition to Late Bronze Age) synchronously with the decline of the conifers and the rise of the pollen curve of Fagus sylvatica. In the course of</page><page sequence="9">Veget Hist Archaeobot (2012) 21:413-427 421 a thousand years beech has replaced the conifers and in this process the anthropogenic impact should also be taken into consideration. The high values of Scleranthus pollen found throughout the entire profile are of local/extra-local origin and are most probably indicative of stock-breeding prac- ticed in the vicinity. The first peak of Scleranthus could be assigned to the onset of the Late Bronze Age. Tschokljovo Marsh, Konjavska Mts., ESM Fig. 5 The study site is nowadays a large marsh (870 m a.s.l.) formed in a depression in the Konjavska Mts. (1,487 m) near to the upper course of the Struma River. The pollen data span the last 9,000 years (Tonkov and Bozilova 1992b; Bozilova and Tonkov 2007). Indications of human presence are not recorded between 7000 and 5200 cal. b.c. when the mountain slopes sur- rounding the marsh were covered by mixed oak forests with Tilia, Corylus avellana , Ulmus, some Carpinus ori- entalis/Ostrya carpini/olia and C. betulus. On the higher mountain areas stands of Pinus sp. and A. alba occurred. The following period of ca. 3,000 years (5200-ca. 2000 cal. b.c.) is characterized by a vast spread of A. alba forests. The most interesting feature, however, is the con- tinuous presence of Juglans pollen, probably indicating its native distribution in this area rather than cultivation by the local population. During the subsequent period, which lasted until the start of the Roman occupation (pollen zone transition T-4/ T-5), the palynological indications of human presence and activity occur rather sporadically. The coniferous forests composed of A. alba and Pinus were replaced by forests of F. sylvatica , also around the start of the Roman period. Wood charcoal analysis The summary of the data from wood charcoal analysis is given in Fig. 3. The dominant vegetation type around the archaeological sites is deciduous oak forest and its repre- sentatives dominate the anthracological assemblages. An important characteristic of the wood charcoal assemblages is the increasing proportion of light demanding shrubby forest border and undergrowth elements of the oak forests. At most of the sites this is shown by the rather high percentage proportions of Cornus sp. wood (Marinova and Thiebault 2008; Marinova et al. 2002), followed by representatives of Rosaceae, and to a lesser extent, of Juniperus sp. and Corylus avellana. Many of these small trees and shrubs could not easily be detected by the paly- nological investigations as they are not wind- but insect- pollinated and/or were growing mainly in the lowlands, far from the palynological sites available in the study area. The anthracological records cover the period when farming started in the study area and thus overcome some of the above mentioned disadvantages of the palynological evi- dence in tracing the first anthropogenic influence on the vegetation. Figure 3 shows that, starting with the Early Neolithic then until the Early Chalcolithic, the proportions of the light-demanding woodland (given in Fig. 3 under "Forest border/undergrowth") and riparian woodland increase in the anthracological assemblages. It can also be seen that the Neolithic population certainly had access to Pinus stands or woodland at lower elevations, most prob- ably those were mainly P. nigra stands nowadays greatly diminished by anthropogenic pressure (Bondev 1991). Discussion The palynological evidence on the anthropogenic changes of the vegetation is summarized and correlated for the different sub-regions in Fig. 4. This summary is based on the palynological examples closely considered in this paper (ESM Figs. 1-5) and on additional evidence described in detail by Tonkov (2007). The development of the natural landscapes is discussed in the context of the changing human occupation in the area and of the climate change events observed on a global scale discussed in Bond et al. (2001), Mayewski et al. (2004) and Wanner et al. (2008). First signs of human impact on the vegetation (Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, 6200-2800 cal b.c.) The up-to-date palynological evidence from southwestern Bulgaria shows the response of the vegetation to the 8200 B.p. event, this response best manifested by the expansion of Abies alba in the coniferous belts of Rila and Pirin mountains. (Tonkov et al. 2008). The start of the Holocene climate optimum facilitated the spread of mixed oak forests at low and mid-altitudes, where later the first prehistoric settlements were founded. The palynological records from the area under consideration come from higher altitudes, in most cases above 1,000 m, hence above the main area of activity of the Neolithic population and of limited use for reconstructing human impact on the vegetation for that period. For the only site lower than this limit, Tschokljovo marsh (870 m a.s.l.), the resolution of the palynological record is not high for this period, and shows that oak forests with hazel as a pioneering element were present in the lowlands. The evidence from wood charcoal analysis is very useful for tracing the woodland use in the initial stages of farming introduction in the region, as this comes directly from the prehistoric settlements. The anthracological as well as the palynological records indicate wide distribution of decid- uous forests dominated by Quercus sp. These were the â Springer</page><page sequence="10">422 Veget Hist Archaeobot (2012) 21:413-427 main woodland resource used by the Neolithic population. In the course of the Neolithic light-demanding trees and shrubs became more important in the oak woodlands. This change is related to the increased disturbance of the woodland by the local people, e.g. establishment of culti- vating fields, grazing of animals, collecting fruits, fodder and firewood. This led to an increase of forest edge zones and secondary forests. Similar tendencies are also observed in the palynological records from Slovenia for the period of ca. 5500 cal. b.c., when no forest clearance occurred during the Neolithic period, but small-scale forest modifications, burning and coppicing were detected (Andric and Willis 2003). Moreover, the Neolithic land use strategies, involving coppicing and pollarding and forest pasture of small ruminants, favoured and enlarged such landscapes as is visible in the evidence from Central Europe (Kalis et al. 2003; Kreuz 2008; Bleicher and Herbig 2010; Gardner 2002; Magyari et al. 2012). The evidence from Anatolia (Asouti and Hather 2001; Fairbairn et al. 2002; Riehl and Marinova 2008), the Balkans and Central Europe shows quite uniform land use strategies for broad parts of the continent during the Neolithic, resulting in slight modifi- cations of the woodlands and leading to a more patchy character of the forests, with increasing diversity of their composition. Considering also the hypothesis of the uni- formity of the Neolithic crop cultivation practices in Central Europe, South Eastern Europe and the Near East proposed by Bogaard (2004), a uniformity of general plant use strategies (including both field cultivation and land use) for this broad area could even be suggested. However palynological records with detailed chronological estima- tions as well as wood charcoal records concerning all stages of the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic are still needed to reconstruct reliably and more specifically the impact on the vegetation of the agriculture and land use for these periods which span over 1,800 years. Moreover the role of fire in shaping the vegetation and landscape still needs to be explored by increasingly including micro- and macro- charcoal records, which at present are very scarcely available for the region. In the pollen diagrams from Northern Pirin, Konjavska and Maleshevska mountains (ESM Figs. 2, 3, and 5) the first sporadic indications of cultivation of cereals (Cerealia- type) and grazing activities (Cirsium- type, P. lanceolata- type, Polygonum aviculare- type, Rumex , Scleranthus) appear during the Late Neolithic (ca. 5500-5000 cal. b.c.). This is related to more intensive Late Neolithic occupation of the region compared to the previous period. At the beginning of the Late Neolithic there are about 15 recorded settlements, during the second half there are 23, these being situated on the first or second terrace of the river, but higher up as well (Grębska- Kulowa and Kulow 2007). Hence, the first clearly noticeable anthropogenic indicators Springer in the palynological record coincide with the increasing number of settlements. It seems that the signal is rather of extra local character as it is visible in all of the palyno- logical records considered (Fig. 4; ESM Figs. 1-5), including those from the higher mountain sites. The second half of the Late Neolithic is the period contemporary with the expansion of the deciduous and coniferous trees (for- mation of Pinus and Abies belt) in the mountains along the Struma valley. The spread of A. alba after 5250 cal. b.c. suggests an increase in humidity and temperature (Bozilova and Tonkov 1994). Against this background the indications of increasing light-demanding trees and of the enlarged area for obtaining firewood, present in the wood charcoal assemblages (Fig. 3) should also be interpreted as an indication of anthropogenically-driven opening of the landscape in the surroundings of the sites investigated. The wood charcoal assemblages from the Early Chal- colithic (ca. 4900-4500 cai. b.c.) show a continued increase in the use of light-demanding and riparian woodland. The settlements decreased in number and moved to hilly areas with defendable locations (Grębska- Kulowa and Kulow 2007). During the transition between the Late Chalcolithic to the start of the Early Bronze Age (ca. 3800-3200 cal. b.c.) there are almost no indications of anthropogenic impact on the vegetation, except a few weak peaks of secondary anthropogenic indicators such as P. lanceolata- type, Scleranthus , Polygonum aviculare- type and Cichorioideae. Such secondary anthropogenic indicators pointing to pas- ture activities are also present in the contemporary paly- nological records from south western Balkans (Sadori 2007). These are usually interpreted as a result of pasture activities. For this period the archaeological evidence also suggests subsistence relying on herding and the presence of fairly mobile groups (Leshtakov 2006). Large scale human impact on the landscape traceable over the region (Late Bronze Age to Iron Age, 1400-100 cal. b.c.) After a period with a shift to increasing pastoralism and less permanent settlements around 3200-2200 cal. b.c. the number of settlements in the study area during the Late Bronze Age (1400-1200 cal. b.c.) increased rapidly. For example, in the Middle Struma valley Grębska- Kulowa and Kulow (2007) report about 33 sites (compared with 3 sites for the preceding period). The Late Bronze Age is also the period with the next peak in the indicators of anthropogenic activities. This peak is much more pronounced than that in the Neolithic, and is shown in all of the palynological archives considered. Immediately after this peak the F. sylvatica curve starts to increase in the palynological record from the Maleshevska peat bog (ESM Fig. 3). A</page><page sequence="11">Veget Hist Archaeobot (2012) 21:413-427 423 similar situation with the rising of Fagus percentage values after anthropogenic impact, and also with records of fire activity was observed at the peat bog Beg Bunar in the Osogovo mountains (Lazarova et al. 2009). This evidence indicates clearly that at least in the lower mountain ranges in the study area the spread of F. sylvatica was favored by anthropgenic activities. This evidence is in accordance with the estimations of Giesecke et al. (2007) for the lowlands of central Europe and for the southern Prealps (Valsecchi et al. 2008), where disturbance and anthropo- genic clearance accelerated the growth of F. sylvatica populations during the Holocene. In the higher mountains (Lake Trilistnika, NW Rila; ESM Fig. 1) the appearance of anthropogenic indicators such as P. lanceolata- type and Rume X is recorded after 1400-1200 cai. b.c. (Late Bronze Age) coinciding with the starting point of increase in F. sylvatica and Picea abies. But it should be mentioned that this is also a period when an increase of moisture avail- ability favourable for both tree species was reconstructed for the Rila Mountains (Tonkov and Marinova 2005), so climatically driven increase of the F. sylvatica population is quite plausible for those higher elevations. However more multi-proxy records with finer chronological resolu- tion from the region are needed to answer this question reliably. For the subalpine zones convincing evidence of human presence is observed in the Rila Mountains in the pollen and plant macrofossil diagrams from the Ostrezki Lakes (Tonkov and Marinova 2005). The pollen curves of taxa such as Cerealia-type, P. lanceolata-type, Rumex, Scleranthus and Urtica , along with macro-charcoals, appeared at 1770 cal. b.c., while numerous charcoal frag- ments indicative of forest fires were found from later, during ca. 800 cal. b.c. After ca. 900-800 cal. b.c. the palynological records from the northern Pirin (this paper, and also Stefanova et al. 2003), Maleshevska and Osogovo mountains also show pronounced peaks of anthropogenic indicators indicating mainly pasture (e.g. Artemisia , Cir- sium- type, P. lanceolata , Rumex , Scleranthus) and a partial deforestation of the area. At many places the upper tree- line was artificially lowered in order to extend the high mountain pasture land. At lower elevations the mixed oak forests were destroyed and communities of Carpinus ori- entalis and Quercus pubescens , secondary in origin, were formed. The onset of this period with prominent anthro- pogenic activities is contemporaneous with the Early Iron Age in the area. It is also marked by the end of a dry climatic interval from approx. 1100 to 900 cal. b.c. also registered in the Hungarian and Thracian plains (Chapman et al. 2009). The period of ca. 800 b.c. onwards for the Eastern Mediterranean is characterized by an increase in humidity and temperatures (Bar-Matthews et al. 1999; Lamy et al. 2006). Since 800 b.c. and especially around 500^00 b.c. human impact on the vegetation becomes clearly pronounced and continuous on a large scale. This is also clearly visible in the adjacent areas (Andric 2002; Atha- nasiadis et al. 2000; Eastwood et al. 1998; Feurdean et al. 2010; Jahns 1993; Knipping et al. 2008; Lazarova et al. 201 1; Mudie et al. 2007; Triantaphyllou et al. 2010). These changes, except for the cultivation of olive which cannot thrive in the study area, strongly resemble the Bey§ehir occupation phase (for more recent discussion on the topic see Bakker et al. 2011). The current evidence confirms the strong element of continuity in land use between the Late Bronze Age settlers and the Early Iron Age communities and the increasing intensity of forest clearance during the Iron Age proposed for the region of southeastern Europe by Chapman et al. (2009). Roman and medieval landscape management and land use The trends observed during the Iron Age (800 b.c- a.d. 100) continued into the Roman period (from ca. a.D. 100-400). The evidence for intensive deforestation and spread of secondary xerothermic vegetation (increases or peaks in Juniperus , Carpinus orientalis/Ostrya carpinifo- lia , Scleranthus , Cichorioideae, Cirsium- type, Artemisia etc.) related to stock-breeding as well as to field and tree cultivation is very well manifested in the pollen diagrams under consideration. In most of the lower mountains in the study area, including the records from Maleshevska, Oso- govo and Tshokljovo (ESM Figs. 3, 4 and 5) considered here, Abies alba played a significant role until the Helle- nistic/Roman period. Evaluating the Holocene palaeoeco- logical record of A. alba in the study area, Bozilova and Tonkov (1994) consider this reduction to be mainly an- thropogenically driven. Similar tendencies for anthropo- genically influenced reduction of A. alba populations over the last 2,000 years are also observed in North Western Romania (Feurdean and Willis 2008) and in Slovenia (Andric 2002). Arboriculture, a typical element of Roman land use, is only partly traceable by the increase of the Juglans curves and in some of the records considered the curves of Vitis sylvestris and Castanea sativa also rise slightly prior to the Roman period. The finds of Juglans regia are also very common and frequent in the archaeo- botanical record of the region for the Iron Age and espe- cially the Roman period (Popova 2009). In general, during the Roman period the local agricultural economy flourished as the Romans introduced a broader spectrum of crops, advanced methods of field cultivation and arboriculture (Bozilova et al. 1994).

However, further analyses and more precise palaeoecological archives for this period are needed to elucidate the medieval human impact on the vegetation and the landscapes in the study area. The only evidence from this time is preserved in the Osogovo peat bog. There, the continuous presence of Secale and Juni- perus pollen since ca. cal. a.d. 1200 indicates the rye cul- tivation typical of the period and increasing deforestation of the mountain. Here the strong and continuous presence of anthropogenic indicators coincides with an increase in Fagus woodlands. Conclusions 1. The first major human impact, visible on a regional scale in the palynological records, appeared in the final stages of the Neolithic (ca. 5000 cal b.c.), when very sporadic indications of cereal cultivation and grazing occurred. 2. Anthropogenic vegetation change began with a slight modification of the xerothermic oak forests in the lowlands, the main area of activity of the Neolithic population, and with the stimulation of the development of light-demanding and in many cases fruit-producing trees and shrubs like Cornus sp., Cory lus avellana , Maloideae, Prunoideae, Rosa sp. etc. The evidence for the Neolithic land use practices is in accordance with that from Anatolia and Central Europe. 3. The first signs of large scale deforestation and more extensive land use are recorded during the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1450-1200 cal. b.c.). In the lower mountains they are followed at many places by the continuous spread of F. sylvatica pointing to the favourable influence of the anthropogenic activities on its expan- sion. They are also marked by the first fairly contin- uous presence of indicators of pasture and fire activities in the mountainous areas. 4. The continuous presence of Juglans pollen from the Early Bronze Age and especially the Late Bronze Age points to its cultivation starting from this period. Its sporadic occurrence in the earlier periods and low percentage values suggest natural occurrence in the area. 5. The next peak of the anthropogenic impact on the vegetation and landscape occurred from 800 cal. b.c. onwards. It reached its maximum during the Roman period when annual crop and tree cultivation, deforestation and selective timber harvesting (A. alba ) reached a vast extension. 6. The current study shows mainly the general tendencies in the human impact on vegetation and landscape that Springer could be inferred from palaeobotanical data. Many questions on the exact timing and extend of those impacts still remain and only future research focusing on high resolution records with more extended age control will help to gain a detailed and comprehensive picture of the human landscapes formed under the interaction of climate and cultural change.
