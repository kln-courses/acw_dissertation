PERRY (Chicago) 0 Introduction 0.1 Twenty-four years ago, Zsigmond Telegdi summed up the basic problems posed by the massive incorporation of Arabic loanwords into Persian: 'Quels facteurs ont déterminé leur sélection? Et comment se sont-ils intégrés au voca- bulaire? Il est à peine douteux qu'avec la rénovation de sa substance, le vocabu- laire a été réstructurée. Comment ce procès s'est-il accompli...?'1 Telegdi argued on the basis of earlier studies by Lazard that the majority of Arabic borrowings into Persian are in origin mots savants, incorporated in the writings of bilingual Iranian scholars over the course of several centuries after the end of direct Arab rule in Iran - i.e., taken not from a living Arabic vernacular, but from an already 'classical' literary Arabic that continued to serve as a source for neo- logisms (much as Latin, after the demise of the Roman empire, continued to enrich French and the other languages of medieval and modern Europe). Much of this initially specialized, learned vocabulary then 'trickled down' into every- day usage. The semantic processes by which this lexical assimilation was effected - which in the Latin-script documents of European vernaculars are typically sig- naled by orthographic changes, generally indicative in turn of phonological evo- lution - are for the most part unacknowledged in the case of Arabic loanwords in written Persian. Whatever their stylistic register (nonce Fremdwort, assimi- lated Lehnwort, colloquialism, etc.), they appear in the Perso-Arabic script in precisely the same form as their Arabic etyma. This convention gives the errone- ous impression of a timeless, monophonie, monomorphic and monosemantic lexical superstratum, and restricts our recognition of the ways in which Arabic mots savants were incorporated, sorted and redefined in their semantic and sociolinguistic ranges as they rubbed shoulders with the native vocabulary. 1 Remarques sur les emprunts arabes en persan.

R. PERRY 0.2 In only one morphological class of Arabic loanwords is there a systematic, orthographically-signaled, phonetic change triggered by the fact of incorporation into Persian and sensitive to semantic shift or other diachronic processes. Those Arabic etyma with the feminine ending, as written in Arabic with the hybrid graph known as the tâ' marbûta and alternating in articulation between /-at/ and /-a/ in accordance with syntactic criteria, must be lexicalized definitively in Persian as either /-at / or /-a/. They are then written with full final t ( tâ ' mabsûta, tâ-ye tammat ) as in qimat 'price', or with mute h ( hâ-ye maxfi), as in loqme 'morsel'. (Transcription of this syllable as e reproduces the raised vowel quality of Tehran, or standard, Persian; this feature is not germane to the discussion - in fact, it is anachronistic when applied to Classical Persian vocabulary - but it has the advantage of further distinguishing the two forms in question2). In some cases, what appears to be the same etymon occurs regularly in both -at and -e forms, with systematically differentiated meanings or usages (as vas lat 'marriage', vasle 'patch'); these comprise the main class of 'doublets' to be dis- cussed below. This dichotomous form class has a membership of ca. 1500 in modern Persian, inclusive of more than 800 items in -a and almost 700 in -at, and about forty pairs of doublets. This accounts for almost one quarter of the Arabic vocabulary in Persian, and about seven percent of the total Persian vocabulary in general use. More than 200, or 25 percent, of the words now ending in -e were originally incorporated in -at, and have 'shifted' (i.e., lost final Iti) in the course of the past thousand years. In principle, lexical affiliation in -at or -e has nothing to do with the way in which Arabic words with a feminine ending are represented in Arabic collocations occurring in Persian, as tazkerat ol-awleyâ', yamin ol-dawle, etc. In these, orthography follows the syntactically-governed conventions of Arabic, and may randomly coincide with or contradict the lexicalized form of Arabic loans (as in these examples, where the corresponding loanwords are tazkere and dawlat). Elsewhere I have shown at length that the dichotomy corresponds systematically to fundamental semantic, syntactic and sociolinguistic categories of Persian, and that the 'migrants' from -at to -e were for the most part responding to an extension of lexical scope or a shift in usage which carried them across these same categories.3 The categories may be summarily characterized and exemplified as follows. First, let me briefly define the less common terms for nominais (intended to be valid for English, Persian and Arabic) which will be used here. An instance noun refers to the intangible exercise of an action on one occasion: a nap or a sleep are instance nouns, sleep or sleeping are action nouns; or it refers to a 2 Similarly, I have transcribed the third vowel of loanwords such as morâqebat as e, reflecting the usual Persian pronunciation, rather than a, the canonical Arabic voweling; this mixed system of strict transliteration for consonants and broad transcription for covert vowels, a common and useful device for Persian, does not misrepresent the Arabic-script form of the words discussed. 3 John R.

A product noun denotes the outcome of an action, whether tangi- ble (a script ) or intangible (an analysis ); it differs from an instance noun in that its referent continues in existence after the action that produced it has ceased. As the English examples illustrate, distinct categories may be formally differenti- ated (sleep/nap) or they may be isomorphic and their usage distinguished only syntactically ([a] kindness ); this is no less true in Persian. Arabic grammatical terminology recognizes some of these as morpholexical classes (e.g., the mas- dar , or action noun; the ism al-marra or instance noun), but this designation cannot automatically be applied to loanwords: Persian 'emârat 'a building, edi- fice' is not an action noun, even if its Arabic etymon technically (and histori- cally) was.4 To summarize the -at/-e dichotomy as a system: abstract or intangible concepts of relatively low imageability, realized frequently as action nouns and quality nouns, tend to be affiliated in -at: thus esteqâmat 'persistence', Saxsiyat 'personality'. Concrete or tangible entities, and concepts of relatively high im- ageability, tend to be affiliated in -e' thus käse 'bowl', esâre 'sign, reference', and personal and place names ( xadije , soltâniye). In the case of more abstract or less imageable referents, the overriding criterion is generally that of mass noun vs. count noun, i.e. non-pluralizing loans tend to end in -at ( rotubat 'dampness', moqâvemat 'resistance'), while pluralizing loans tend to end in -e (esâre-hâ 'indications, signs', tajrobe-hâ 'experiences, experiments', estefâde-hâ (az naft) 'the uses (of oil)', motâle'e' motâle'ât 'study; studies'). Action nouns frequently used independently, i.e. as nominalizations of a verb phrase (and thus as mass nouns), tend to end in -at, whereas those used as a verb (in conjunction with an auxiliary such as ¡cardan ) tend to end in -e: thus ehânat 'scorn', estejâbat (-e do'â) 'granting (of a prayer)', but estefâde kardan 'to use', esâre kardan 'to refer, show', motâle'e kardan 'to study'. It will be no- ticed that the latter forms often coincide with count-noun derivatives of instance or product as mentioned above (esâre 'sign, indication, gesture', etc). Mots savants that have remained in the higher literary registers tend to end in -at (e.g. hekâyat 'anecdote'), whereas loans that have assimilated into the everyday vernacular tend to end in -e (e.g. qesse 'story'). The migrants that have shifted from -at to -e have ipso facto demonstrated a degree of assimilation, and may often be shown to have changed or expanded their semantic or syntactic scope in accordance with the criteria outlined above. Thus tajrobat, as the word was written before the thirteenth century, was used only in the singular, 'experience, testing'; maqâlat extended its meaning from 'speaking, discours- ing' to 'discourse, treatise' during the twelfth century before definitively shifting to maqâle (2.2). It will be obvious that there are many apparent exceptions to the individ- ual tendencies enunciated here, but also that the criteria are to a great extent interdependent. A greater degree of assimilation into the vernacular often im- 4 Cf. Ibid., 8-10. Acta Orient. Hung. XLVIH, 1995</page><page sequence="4">130 J.R.PERRY plies some semantic extension or specialization, such as the acquisition of in- stance or product noun status, which automatically entails count noun status and a higher imageability; from a functional standpoint, several distinct explanations may often be adduced for one and the same instance of shift. The comparative chronology of incorporation or assimilation has also exercised an influence. Some 150 common count nouns in -at, both tangible and intangible (e.g. mamle- kat 'kingdom, country', 'emârat 'building, edifice', mosibat 'disaster', 'âqebat 'consequence, sequel') were borrowed in the earliest period of literary Persian, and their count-noun metonymy either already existed in Arabic or was acquired soon after their incorporation into Persian (by the early eleventh century); these have evidently resisted the shift to -e undergone by such loans as maqâlat and tajrobat.5 0.3 The one hundred or so doublets among these feminine-ending loans are a valuable set of guinea pigs with which to exemplify and test the various criteria and processes of -at/-e affiliation and shift. The wonder is that it took so long for this intriguing lexical class to excite the curiosity of Persian scholars. During the 1950s, Mojtabâ Minovi in a study of the subset of loans in - iyat/-iye 6 and Ahmad Bahmanyâr in the 'Orthography' section of the introduction to Dehxodâ's lexi- con were the first to point to a systematic dichotomy at work: the latter percep- tively commented that Persian speakers had put this orthographic happenstance to creative use, and identified six pairs of the doublets treated below.7 While my Form and Meaning... was still in press, two Iranian scholars published discus- sions of the feminine-ending doublets (one as a critique of the other, and neither as yet having read my work).8 The present article is an attempt to further the discussion in a theoretical direction by incorporating or critiquing observations of A'lam and Sâdeqi, revising some of my earlier analyses, and comparing other types of doublets in Persian and other languages. The majority of Persian -at/-e doublets result from the diachronic shift alluded to; instead of completing the shift to -e, processes such as qovvat &gt; qovve (2.1) have left a lexical trace in -at which preserves a distinct part of the meaning or usage. Other pairs, such as sarârat 'wickedness' vs. šaráre 'spark' (1.1), were borrowed independently of one another; though their affiliation re- flects the appropriate semantic criteria, it distinguishes not an acquired semantic change but an original homonymy in Arabic resulting from one of three processes: (i) a coincidence of roots ('radical homonymy'), or (ii) a coincidental surface realization of two, distinct derivations from the same root ('derivational 5 Ibid., 114-5, 198-9. 6 "-iyyat"-e masdari.

There are even a few covert 'triplets', involving both homonymy and shift. Of the pairs resulting from a shift, it is worth distinguishing those that reflect relatively straightforward lexical changes ( âyat/âye , etc., section 2) from pairs where the -at/-e split marks distinctions of usage in collocation, derivation, or other idiomatic contexts (section 3). Finally, the shift appears still to be in progress; there are a number of pairs (section 4) where selection of the -at or -e reflex in contemporary Persian is a matter of elegant variaton, based upon no clear-cut distinction other than stylistic register; judgment of the degree to which such alternatives are acceptable, archaic, etc., may vary even among native speakers (as is illustrated in differences of opinion between A'lam and Sâdeqi, and among Persian dictionaries). In the case of each of these categories except the last, it also seems necessary to distinguish between pairs that present a clear synchronic distinction and pairs that apparently, or arguably, were so distinguished at some earlier point, but where at least one of the reflexes, e.g. maqâlat (2.2), or amniye (1.2), is no longer in current usage, or where the contrast is no longer so clear. Several of these 'asymmetric' pairs have been ignored or discounted by Aiam or Sâdeqi, but they are especially illuminating on the evolution and rationale of feminine-ending doublets. 1 Disambiguation of Homonyms 1.1 šarārat 'wickedness, evil' šarāre 'spark' vaslat 'marriage, relationship' vasle 'patch' resâlat 'mission, prophethood' resâle 'message, treatise' eqâmat 'stay(ing), residence' eqâme 'initiating, adducing; call to prayer' sehhat 'health, validity' sehhe 'endorsement, signature' 1.1.1 The pair šarārat/ šarāre (Aiam, 27; Sâdeqi, 33; Perry, 57, 59) is a case of radical homonymy arising from a coincidence of surface forms in derivatives from the homonymie roots ŠRR 'evil' and ŠRR 'spark(s)'. They concur with the semantic characteristics of their respective endings, šarārat being a mass noun of quality (in terms of Arabic grammar, a masdar, or infinitive, of a stative or qualitative verb) and šarāre a count noun of product, intangible but highly im- ageable (from an Arabic grammatical viewpoint, a unitary noun from the collec- tive noun šarár 'sparks'): this kind of split I shall refer to as 'schematic'. The Arabic etyma of vaslat/vasle (Aiam, 29; Sâdeqi, 34; Perry, 83-4) are wusla (1) 'act of joining, connection; marriage (union)' and (2) - also wasla - 'joint, joist, mortise'. The Persian endings reflect their respective usage as an abstract noun of instance and a concrete noun of product or instrument. The change of vowel in modern Persian vaslat ( voslat is also recorded in earlier Acta Orient. Hung. XLV1II, 1995</page><page sequence="6">132 J. R. PERRY usage) is perhaps due to contamination by the cognate loan vasi 'joining, connection' (Arabic wasla, which is the unitary noun derived from vasi, is an Arabic grammatical term, 'post-juncture quiescent alif, irrelevant to and not found in Persian). Essentially this doublet pair represents a disambiguation of separate though homonymie derivatives of one and the same root in Arabic, though in view of the transparent metaphorical relations between these cognates, and the likely influence of vasi, it seems possible that some blending has also taken place. A more straightforward case is resâlat/resâle (A'lam, 26; Çâdeqi, 33; Perry, 57-8, 129-30), at least synchronically speaking: the endings neatly distinguish between the quality noun 'apostleship, prophethood' and the homonymie product noun from the same root 'missive, (written) dissertation'. Diachronically, however, these common and culturally freighted loans have been nicely entangled. Both words were originally inducted in the one form resâlat (10th- 13th centuries), and each had a broader range of meaning, reflecting the métonymie continuum of their Arabic etyma: 'prophetic status/mission; (secular) diplomatic mission; diplomatic correspondence' (as in divân-e resâlat 'the chancellery, court secretariat'); 'a formal letter, essay' ( divân-e rasā' el, the Samanid and Ghaznavid chancellery, using the Arabic 'broken' plural of resâlat 'letter'; cf. še'r o resâlat-hâ 'poetry and essays' in Nâser-e Xosraw). Not until Sa'di does the form resâle 'letter, treatise' assert itself consistently to distinguish the tangible count noun from the abstract or collective mass noun. In present-day usage resâlat 'apostleship' is a specialized religious term, resâle 'dissertation' is a staple of academic and student jargon. Similarly, eqâmat/eqâme (A'lam, 25; Sâdeqi, 34; Perry, 71, 73, 106, 107) are recorded earlier (13th century) in the single form eqâmat, and were not spelled contrastively before the seventeenth century. The derivational homo- nymy here is particularly subtle, involving 'merely' a difference of verbal aspect in the Arabic base verb; however, as illustrated in the derivational tree (figure l),9 idioms evolving from Theme IV (which adds a causative or declarative dimension to each aspectual sense) are sufficiently disparate to justify a separate lexical entry. This is not an option in traditional, morphology-bound Arabic lexi- cography, since the masdar of Theme IV (unlike that of Theme I) can have only one form. In Persian, however, the shift to -e by the inceptive-causative/declara- tive sense ('initiation, performance of a formal or ritual act; declaration "qad qâmat al-salâ" as a bidding to prayer') and the resulting exclusivity of the stative sense to the -at reflex ('residence, sojourn') has accomplished this useful taxonomie task. The result is two action nouns, each of which readily reverbal- izes with the addition of a Persian auxiliary ( eqâmat dáštan 'to reside, dwell'; eqâme kardan 'to initiate, perform; announce the bidding to prayer'). This may 9 Sec Perry, Form and Meaning 71; for the suppression of the conventional object ('flocks') in Theme IV, see A. de Biberstein Kazimirski, Dictionnaire arabe-français (2 vols.) Paris 1860.

Derivation of eqâmat/eqâme The pair çehhat/sehhe (A'lam, 24; Sâdeqi, 34; Perry, 83) constitutes a neat schematic split between a mass noun of state or quality and a tangible count noun of instance or product. The origin and status of sehhe, however, are ques- tionable. The meaning 'signature, endorsement, validation' is not found for Arabic sihha[t], being more appropriate to the 'declarative' Theme II infinitive, tashih. Persian sehhe is probably a fabrication, using the well-known concretiz- ing function of Persian -e added to the conventional Arabic notation çahh 'it is valid' (with sympathetic vowel change) to produce a hybrid çehha 'signature, in- stance of notation of endorsement' . 1.2 naťat 'genesis, growth' nas 'e 'drunkenness, a "high"; drunk, high' marârat 'bitterness' marâre 'gall bladder' maymanat 'fortune, prosperity' maymane (a) 'right wing' (of army) (b) name of a town Acta Orient.

The Arabic roots are not identical ( NŠ ' 'genesis, growth' for naš'at and NŠW 'drunken dizziness' for naš'e' this last form, with hamza, does not occur in Arabic, and even in Persian is only an alternative to našwe, which does recapitu- late one of the Arabic forms našwa/nišwa/nušwa). The pair marârat/marâre (A'lam, 28; Sâdeqi, 32, 35; Perry, 57, 59) displays a minimal homonymy by dint of metonymy in Arabic; the schematic split is original, not the result of shift. This is true also of the Classical Persian pair maymanat/maymane (Aiam, 29; Sâdeqi, 34, 35; Perry, 45-7, 59), a rather more interesting case, as figure 2 will illustrate.

The metaphorical sense surfaces in a quality or state noun (Arabic masdar mimi), which is of the same form (maf'ala) as the locus noun; this maymana2 was also borrowed into Persian, and the resulting homonymie clash was automatically avoided by schematic application of the -at/-e split. There is, however, a second maymane in Persian, viz. Maimana, a town in north- ern Afghanistan. This conforms with the application of the -e ending to topo- nyms, and might fairly be interpreted as a locus noun (cf. Arabic marāģa 'pas- ture, grazing ground' as the Iranian city of Maragheh). If so, the history of the town's name would claim a derivation through the metaphorical sense ( mayma - naļ, a word not found in the Arabic dictionaries), not the (pre-empted) locational sense: i.e., 'place of good augury', not 'place on the right/to the south'.10 The next two pairs (yahudiyat/-e, mânaviyat/-e' Perry, 24, 28, 39) illus- trate the disambiguation of nouns of quality (here, social category, i.e. religious affiliation) from toponyms or collectivities. The same principle is at work in the archaic zojâjiyat/zojâjiye (Perry, 34), distinguishing the quality from an anatomi- cal item characterized by that quality, and amniyat/amniye (A'lam, 25; Sâdeqi, 33; Perry, 31), the latter term being a modern (but now obsolete) coinage on the analogy of terms for collective bodies such as mânaviye or sufiye 'the Sufis'. The structural origin of such terms in -iye lies in the 'stranded epithet,' i.e. the adjectival member of a noun phrase such as Arabic al-quwâ al-amniyya (&gt;Arabicate Persian qovâ-ye amniyé) 'security forces'; the head noun (feminine, or a grammatically feminine plural) is suppressed and the adjective, complete with its feminine concord, remains as the collective term. The quality noun in -iyat has been particularly productive for neologisms and pseudo- Arabic loans of the type irâniyat 'Iranian-ness, Iranian (national) character' (now irânigari ) and xariyat 'asininity'. The last three pairs listed here all illustrate the interplay of these propensities in different ways. The Classical and literary raviyat 'reflection, consideration, thought' is a genuine Arabic loanword (root RW'), logically affiliated in -at as a mass noun of action. However, it is attested as early as 'Awfi (ca. 1220) in the senses 'manner, way, method, rule, course (of action), policy'; these uses are semantically close, but are not justified by the Arabic etymon and are in no case an obvious exten- sion of the basic meaning. Most likely this 'metaphorical extension' is actually an Arabicate coinage from the Persian stem raw 'go' (cf. a modern near-syno- nym, the Persian action/instance noun raves). As a count noun of instance, raviyat in this sense shifted to raviye, creating the 'doublet' which is found in several Persian dictionaries produced in Iran a few decades ago, not only in the sense 'way, method, etc.', but also in the meaning 'reflection, etc.' which is proper to raviyat : this popular confusion is reflected in the entry raviye in, e.g., Miller's Persidsko-russkii slovar' (Moscow 1960) and in the entry raviye 10 See Guy Le Strange, The Lands of the Eastern Caliphate.

Several Indo-Persian lexicographers, on the other hand, were careful to preserve (or intuit) the distinction of form and meaning and even to identify raviye as a Persian blend (as seen in the independent entries for raviyat and raviye in Steingass' Persian-English Dictionary of 1892).' 1 In baladiyat/baladiye (A'lam, 25-6; Perry, 28-9, 32, 39), the latter is a legitimate (though obsolete) Arabic loan, a stranded epithet from al-hay'a al- baladiyya 'municipal council'; baladiyat, used either pompously, as baladiyat ba-oslub-e loģat 'proficiency in the structure of the language', or waggishly, as ye otâq jâru ¡cardan ke baladiyat nemixâd 'it doesn't take know-how to sweep a floor', is a pure Persian creation, a nominalization of the everyday idiom (X) balad budan 'to be familiar with, able to handle (X)'. Though perhaps derived from Arabic balad 'village, town, region', it no longer has any transparent rela- tionship with it or its nisba derivative, but is an independently-derived quality noun coined, perhaps, on the analogy of ahliyat 'aptness, (legal) capacity', from an idiomatic use of ahi 'fit, capable'. Similar are šahriyat/šahriye (A'lam, 27; Perry, 32, 39, 111, 181): from Arabic šahr 'month' is regularly formed the nisba substantive šahriyya 'salary', appropriately affiliated in -e as a tangible count noun when borrowed into Persian; native Persian šahr 'town, city' generates a modern pseudo-loan in šahriyat, a subjectively expressive or humorous quality noun like xariyat or baladiyat. 2 Semantic change 2.1 âyat '(divine) sign, portent' aye '(scriptural) verse' qovvat 'strength, might' qovve 'power, force, faculty' morâqebat 'observation, supervision' morâqebe '(devout) contemplation' tariqat 'Sufi brotherhood' tariqe 'way, method, manner' moçâhebat 'companionship, society' mosâhebe 'interview' mosâ'edat 'assistance, aid' mosâ'ede '(pecuniary) aid, advance' havâlat 'transfer, handing over' havâle 'bank draft' ; +V 'to transfer; chuck' hamâsat 'gallantry, knight-errantry' hamâse 'epic (poem)' ketâbat '(art, style of) writing' ketâbe '(piece of) writing, motto, inscription' mas 'alat 'asking, begging' mas 'ale 'problem, matter' ta 'zeyat 'condolence, mourning' ta 'zeye 'Moharram passion play' nawbat 'turn, watch' nawbe 'intermittent fever, malaria' zarbat 'a beating, blow' zarbe 'a blow, stroke, lash' martabat 'status, rank, position' martabe '(repeated) time, occasion' 1 1 Perry, Form and Meaning, 54, 59; for citations, see under both forms in Logatnâme-ye Dehxodâ.

The exceptions are mosâhebe and morâje'e, which are nineteenth-century neologisms coined independently of their ana- logues in -at. In every case there is a transparent (or historically traceable) se- mantic relation between the pairs. The first eleven listed here may be classed as cases of straightforward lexical specialization, where the term in -e represents a more specialized or concretized (tangible or highly imageable) instance of the quality, activity, etc. expressed by the historically earlier term in -at. Thus âye (A iam, 25; Sâdeqi, 34, 36; Perry, 82, 83, 106, 107, 131) is a specific kind of sign or wonder from God ( âyat ), mosâ'ede (Aiam, 27; Sâdeqi, 38; Perry, 66, 209) is a specific and tangible kind of assistance. Often this development is accompanied, schematically, by the attainment of count-noun status in the -e reflex: havâle-hâ, havâlejât 'bank drafts, etc.'; ketâbe-hâ 'mottoes, inscriptions, etc.' - fourteen of the -e reflexes in this section are countable, as against five of the -at reflexes. There is one evident exception to the semantic polarity, in that tariqat 'Sufi brotherhood, dervish order' would appear to be more specialized (and concrete, and imageable) than tariqe 'way, manner' (Aiam, 27; Perry, 54, 59, 199). A clear illustration of the historical process at work, well documented in texts, is the pair qovvat/qovve (Aiam, 27; Sâdeqi, 34; Perry, 84, 85, 106, 107, 108-9, 150-1). The original form was qovvat, used not only in its general sense of '(physical) strength, might' but by Avicenna and al-Ghazali in the eleventh century as a specialized philosophical term, '(physiological or mental) faculty, power', as qovvat-e dânande 'facultas intelligens', qovvat-e tamyiz 'faculty of discernment'. By the middle of the twelfth century, however, the shifted form was being widely used for these scientific senses ( qovve-ye dâfe'e 'repellant force', in Nèzâmi 'Aruži), and exclusively so by the end of the sixteenth century; the base form in -at, meanwhile, became exclusively associated with the mass noun of quality 'strength, might'. In modern Persian the count-noun of instance qovve refers additionally to military and industrial power: qovve-hâ/qovâ-ye nezâmi, 'military forces', qovve-ye barq 'electrical power'. The distinction is maintained in derived verbs, as qovvat dâdan 'to revive, invigorate' vs. qovve dâdan 'to motorize, electrify'. The pair ta'zeyat/ta'zeye (Aiam, 26; Sâdeqi, 32, 35; Perry, 63, 106, 107, 145, 148, 182-3) introduces a further dimension. The synchronic contrast is schematic, between an action noun in -at (+V, i.e., belonging primarily to the verbal system, as in combination with goftan to express 'to offer condolences') and a fully nominal substantive in -e (+N): either a specialized instance of the action (the dramatic representation of the Kerbela tragedy among the Shi 'a of Acta Orient. Hung. XLVUI, 1995</page><page sequence="12">138 J.R.PERRY Iran) or a concrete symbol of the mourning for this tragedy (the cenotaph of Husayn as carried in procession among the Shi'a of South Asia). The shift -at &gt; -e marking this specialization presumably took place before or during the estab- lishment of the Shi'i cult in Safavid Iran (early sixteenth century) and was subse- quently introduced into India by Shi'i immigrants from Iran. The unshifted trace ta 'zeyat is relegated to the literary register of Persian, replaced in general use by tasleyat +V (as in Turkish by teselli +V) 'to condole, etc.'; ta'zeye as 'Mohar- ram passion play' has a Persian synonym šabih-xwáni. Diachronically, however, ta'zeye was not acquired through a straightforward doublet split internal to Persian, but seems to have followed a route outlined in figure 3. The original ta 'zeyat 'mourning, condolence' was borrowed from Arabic through Persian into Turkish, where in most or all dialects (notably Ottoman, Azerbaijani, Uzbek and Tatar) it soon shifted to ta 'zeye, with the same meaning. In some cases (as in modern Azerbaijani) it evolved the instance noun sense 'funeral (obsequies)'; among the Shi'i Turkmen of the proto-Safavid period this was further specialized as referring par excellence to the ritual commemoration of Kerbela, and with the establishment of the Shi'a in Iran the word entered Persian usage alongside šabih-xwáni. In terms of immediate provenance, Persian ta'zeye is thus a shifted Rückwanderer from Turkish. Arab. ta'ziya[t] 'condolence' Classical Pers. ta 'zeyat (+ V) - 'condolence' Turk. I ta'zeye (+V) Pers.

Thus nawbat and nawbe (A'lam, 29; Perry, 83, 129) earlier shared both current meanings, as well as a variety of quite concrete specialized uses, such as 'sentry; ceremonial drumroll; drum', before each reflex stabilized. The subtle distinction between zarbat and zarbe (Sâdeqi, 42; Perry, 86) originates in a metaphorical extension of the basic meaning, as in qovvat/qovve and tariqat/tariqe , but is not adequately distinguished in Persian dictionaries: both forms, from an Arabic instance noun (and their plural zarabât, and the basic action noun zarb ) may be used for a physical blow or shock, but zarbat (as the more literary, high-style reflex?) is preferred in figurative use, as zarbat-e qâte' 'decisive blow', while zarbe (as the more vernacular reflex?) is preferred for specialized or technical versions of the physical sense: zarbe-ye farmi 'a knockout' (in boxing), bist zarbe(-ye) šalláq 'twenty lashes' (a flogging, as a statutory punishment). It is tempting also to see an example of the latter in phrases such as motur-e do-zarbe/čahár-zarbe 'two-stroke/four-stroke engine', but here the ending -e is probably the adjectivalizing suffix as in, e.g., otâq-e do- nafare 'double room' . Martabe has transferred the spatial reference of martabat to a temporal one (A'lam, 28; Perry, 45, 120); though both are count nouns, the usual plural marâteb refers only to the spatial martabat, as in ba-marâteb behtar 'considera- bly (i.e., by degrees) better'; martabe is generally seen only as a singular after a numeral (do martabe 'twice', etc.). In erâdat/erâde (A'lam, 25; Sâdeqi, 33; Perry, 70-1, 131-2), Persian distinguishes two modes of volition that had been differentiated idiomatically in Arabic (cf. eqâmat/eqâme). Arabic arâda bihi xayran 'he wished/intended well for him' generates an action noun irâda[t] expressive of a conventional benediction, which becomes Persian erâdat as in erâdatmand '(your) wellwisher; yours sincerely,' in closing a letter; Arabic arâda minhu X 'he wanted/demanded X from him' generates the same form irâda[t' in the sense of imposing the speaker's intention for himself, which becomes Persian erâde. Similarly, the mass action noun morâje'at and the count noun morâje'e (A'lam, 28; Perry, 66, 104, 125) originate one in an intransitive, and the other in a transitive, use of the same Theme III verb in Arabic. Both may combine with an auxiliary, but whereas morâje'at kardan 'to return, go/come back' is the primary context for the -at reflex, putting it squarely in the verbal system, morâje'e kardan 'to refer, have recourse (to)' is a denominal derivative from the specialized count noun reflex in -e (pl. morâje'ât 'references'). 2.2 xetâbat 'office of preacher; address' xetâbe 'address, speech' maqâlat 'discourse'; + V 'to speak' maqâle 'treatise, article' molâtefat 'kindness, favor' molâtefe 'letter, note' e'ânat 'aid, assistance' e'âne 'alms, charitable gift' xebrat 'expertise' xebre 'an expert' 'eddat 'period of probation' 'edde 'number' Aila Orient.

PERRY 2.2.1 The first three pairs all belong to the same experiential field, and exhibit the same process, as resâle, hamâse, ketâbe and mas' ale", a quality noun or action noun in -at generates an instance or product noun in -e expressive of the communicative instrument or document, or exemplar of the oral or literary genre, that is characteristic of the base activity or status. In both maqâlat/-e and xetâbat/-e (Perry, 43-4, 106, 107, 121, 122, 123, 128, 132-3) the process of shift was prolonged: Classical Persian has many instances of maqâlat 'a discourse, treatise' and xetâbat 'a speech, oration' before the -e form was generally ac- cepted and the lexical dichotomy stabilized. In both cases the -at form has sub- sequently dropped out of everyday use and there is no longer a synchronic doublet pair. Conversely molâtefe (Perry, 128), used by the literati of Ghaznavid and Seljuk times for an informal memo or personal note, has since disappeared from the lexicon. With e'ânat/-e (A'lam, 25; Sâdeqi, 35; Perry, 70, 73, 125) we may compare mosâ'edat/-e (2.1). The archaic state noun xobrat/xebrat 'knowlege, expertise' has generated the modern adjectival xobre/xebre 'expert' (A'lam, 26; Perry, 35, 84-5) by a stranded-epithet process, from the collective idiom ahl-e xebrat 'people of knowledge' &gt; [ahl-e] xebre' the former feminine ending has assimilated com- pletely to the homophonous Persian ending -e to derive a new quality noun xebregi 'expertise' and a literary plural xebregân 'experts'. The more specialized sense of the instance noun 'eddat/-e (Perry, 144, 147) 'period of probation before a divorcee may remarry (to ascertain whether she is pregnant)' is now common in - e , removing the distinction between this and the base meaning 'number' - which is now syntactically specialized, occurring normally only in the collocation 'edde{-i) az 'a number of . This type of shift is studied in the next section. 3 Selection for Word Class, Collocation or Citation 3.1 šohrat 'fame, notoriety' šohre 'famous, notorious' zellat 'abjectness, hardship' zelle 'harrassed, fed up' zeyâdat 'excess, increase' zeyâde 'more, extra' kolliyat 'totality, universality' kolliye (-ye) 'the whole (of)' manzelat 'rank, degree, status' ba-manzele-ye 'as, tantamount to' motâbeqat 'congruence, concord' motâbeqe +V 'to compare, collate' 'âreyat 'loan; borrowed' 'âreye 'loan; artificial', +V 'to lend' mohâfezat (+V) 'preservation' mohâfeze-kâríj) 'conservative(ness)' 3.1.1 This category overlaps with several others. We have already seen in the case of, e.g., havâlat/-e (2.1) how one reflex may specialize as an action noun and the other as a count noun and/or in a reconstituted verb or, in the case of xebrat/-e (2.2), how the shifted form may become a type noun and adjective. Here I wish to designate those cases where one reflex (generally the shifted -e form) is exclusively reserved for a syntactically or morphologically marked role, Acta Orient. Hung. XLVIll, 1995</page><page sequence="15">LEXICAL DOUBLETS AS A DERIVATIONAL DEVICE IN PERSIAN 1 4 1 as, e.g., an attributive or predicative adjective, in a fixed collocation, or in a lexical composite. The first three pairs illustrate the designation of the -e reflex as a predicative adjective. Söhre (A'lam, 27; Perry, 84, 85) occurs both in the abso- lute and in ezâfe phrases such as sohre-ye xâss o 'âmm 'the talk of all classes', and is evidently calqued on the analogous idiom in Arabic ( sâra šuhratan 'he became a notoriety', i.e., notorious). We shall see other examples in these sections of an Arabic idâfa phrase as the apparent model for an Arabic loanword in Persian, either alone or in a Persian ezâfe phrase, with a contrastively used -e ending. A similar derivation could be argued for zelle (A'lam, 26; Sâdeqi, 33) and zeyâde (Sâdeqi, 44; Perry, 121). In the latter case, it can be shown that the unshifted -at form first evolved an adjectival usage, both from literary instances (in Sa'di) and by the existence of the derived, morphologically Persian, quality noun zeyâdati 'excess, superabundance' (cf. râhati and salâmati, replacing qual- ity nouns in -at which have evolved into adjectives). The general-purpose predi- cative adjective and adverb zeyâd is a truncated form of zeyâdat, and zeyâde is restricted to predicative phrases such as zeyâde az hadd 'exceeding the bounds'. In kolliyat/-e (A'lam, 27; Sâdeqi, 33; Perry, 28, 31-2, 39, 111) and manzelat/-e (A'lam, 29; Sâdeqi, 34; Perry, 45), the archaic abstract nouns in -at are adapted as -e in everday ezâfe or prepositional phrases following Arabic models. In motâbeqatl-e (Sâdeqi, 42; Perry, 66-7) the -at reflex is used for the quality/state noun only, while the -e reflex is exclusively verbal; in fact motâbe- qe kardan is additionally transitive and involves a subtle shift in meaning, not unlike the more obvious change in morâje'atAe (2.1). The distinction expressed between 'âreyat and 'âreye (A'lam, 27; Sâdeqi, 34; Perry, 112) is similar, with the extra complication that both reflexes may be used adjectivally, though with subtly different senses or at least in different stylistic registers: 'âreyat (seen as a predicative adjective, 'borrowed', in Classical and literary Persian) has evolved a modern all-round adjective 'âreyati 'artificial', of which 'âreye 'borrowed; artificial' is a vernacular variant. Mohâfezat (A'lam, 28; Perry, 66, 82) is both nominal and verbal in usage, while the shifted form occurs only in a specialized nominal compound mohâfeze-kâr '(political) conservative' and its derivatives; hamâse (2.1) is similar in occurring most often (though not exclusively) in the compounds hamâse-sarâ 'epic poet', hamâse-sarâ'i 'epic poetry'. 3.2 efâdat 'communication, efâde 'explanation; benefit; explanation (of a message)' arrogance', +V 'to put on airs' nezârat 'watching, supervision' nezâre ( nazzâre ) +V 'to watch' sirat 'conduct, character; honor' sire 'the Sira (Biography) of the Prophet' rehlat 'departure; decease' rehle 'the Rihla (Travels) of, e.g., Ibn Batuta' ma 'refat 'knowledge, wisdom' ( esm-e ) ma 'refe 'defined noun' kasrat '(large) quantity' jam'-e kasre 'plural of quantity' Acta Orient.

Efâde (Aiam, 25; Sâdeqi, 34, 35; Perry, 70) has acquired a vernacular sense 'arrogance, boastful behavior' (also in the plural, efâde-hâ) and reverbal- ized it. Nezâre/nazâre/nazzâre (A'lam, 29; Perry, 13, 56) are variants attested even in Classical texts, apparently owing to confusion between nezârat 'observa- tion' and nazzâre 'observers), spectators)'. The remaining pairs are the more common examples of a potentially larger class, which may however be considered marginal to the question of the feminine-ending dichotomy and its doublets, and indeed to Persian lexical mor- phology. In each case, the -e reflex of the abstract loanwords in -at obviously represents a Persianization of an original Arabic collocation where the feminine ending would be pronounced as in pausai form, i.e., without /t/ (0.2). The book titles are similarly treated in English and most other languages ('the Sira', etc.) as a citation form. The Arabic grammatical terms and the idiomatic collocation, whether involving a definite article in the original (jam'u'l-qilla[ti ]) or not {sáhibu ' illa[tin ]), are neutralized in a Persian ezâfe phrase which is merely a simplified Arabic idâfa phrase, lexically Persian but morphologically hybrid.12 4 Elegant Variation 4.1 'aqidatZ-e 'belief, opinion' esârat/-e 'indication, sign' kafârat/-e 'atonement, expiation' mošárekat/-e 'partnership' maxâfat/-e 'fear; danger' moxâletat/-e 'intercourse' rotbat/-e 'rank, status, degree' 4.1.1 In these pairs, both forms are in use without any apparent difference in meaning or fixed distinction of usage other than personal preference based upon perceptions of stylistic register or other felicity conditions. The -e reflex results from a process of historical shift; where speakers judge the -at reflex to be literary or archaic, though acceptable in some contexts, we may consider the shift to be not yet completed (e.g., 'aqidat/-e, ešárat/-e, rotbat/-e). The distinc- tion may be reinforced by selection for word class or usage: ešáre +V, i.e. esâre kardan 'to point, indicate' would be preferred to ešárat +V (and cf. maxâfat/-e, 12 These examples and others may be found in A'lam, 27, 29, and Sâdeqi, 34, 35, 36, 40; they are not treated in Perry, Form and Meaning.

Only time and usage will determine in each individual case whether the shift -at &gt; -e will be aborted, completed, or resolved as a doublet pair. 5 Towards an Analysis of Persian Doublets The total of sixty pairs discussed above may be broken down, in partly over- lapping categories, into the following three types: Current synchronic pairs (1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1) 36 Semantically/syntactically distinctive synchronic pairs (1.1, 2. 1,3.1) 29 Asymmetric (putative diachronically distinctive pairs: 1.2, 2.2, 3.2) 24 Despite the clear contrasts presented by a core of these doublets (mini- mally, the twenty-nine pairs of the second type above), acceptability judgments of the remaining pairs recorded or postulated are likely to remain subjective. A'lam counts thirty-seven pairs, without aspiring to be definitive; Sâdeqi adds eleven, to make forty-eight; in Form and Meaning, I originally included forty pairs as showing current synchronic contrast, examined thirty of these as being similarly (or differently) contrasted in Turkish, Urdu, etc. (cf. 6.1), and men- tioned a further half-dozen possible diachronic contrasts. 5.1 A'lam (p. 29) generalizes that in many cases the -at reflex is Classical or literary in register, while the -e reflex is more colloquial; and that the -at form is often closer to the original Arabic meaning, whereas the -e form bears a meta- phorical or specialized sense. This is true, and bears out the general observation that affiliation in -at or -e and selective shift of -at to -e illustrate the process of incorporation of these borrowings as mots savants and their subsequent assimila- tion into the vernacular. Sâdeqi, in an attempt to categorize pairs, adopts an analysis exploited by Minovi and (in an expanded form) the present author in the works cited, namely that of Arabic morpholexical categories. Most of the -at reflexes, he states, have the meaning or function of a masdar or esm-e masdar (an infinitive or nomen actionis), while the -e reflexes (apart from masdars of certain derived themes of the Arabic verb) are mostly substantives (esm) or, occasionally, adjectives.13 Statistically this is true, but it does not contribute to a semantic profile of the -at and -e moieties. The term masdar is peculiar to Arabic lexicology, in which the verb is the preferred derivational basis: it therefore includes abstracts which, since they are masdars of stative or qualitative verbs such as šarra 'is ill-natured, wicked' or qawiya 'is strong', would better be termed quality nouns. In terms of Arabic grammar, šarára 'wickedness' and quwwa 'strength, power' are deverbal nouns of action or instance, but from a general semantic viewpoint the feature 'wicked' or 'strong' is the basic sense, and these derivatives are de-adjectival nouns of quality or instance. Once assimilated into the Persian lexicon, furthermore, they '3 Sâdeqi, 34, 35-6. Acta Orient. Hung. XLVIII, 1995</page><page sequence="18">144 J. R. PERRY may no longer legitimately be 'derived' from a verb (sarra, qawiya , etc.) which does not exist in Persian. They must, on the other hand, be categorized under the semantic or syntactic roles they have assumed in Persian, which may or may not approximate to those of their etymon in Arabic: šarárat 'wickedness' and qovvat 'strength, might' as mass nouns of quality, qowe 'faculty, (source of) energy, (military) force' as a count noun of instance or instrument (0.2). 5.2 Though ostensibly confining his analysis within the technicalities of Arabic lexicology, Sâdeqi uses esm 'noun, substantive' in its general Persian sense, as well as in its technical Arabic meaning in contradistinction to masdar, which exposes his generalizations to impreciseness and apparent contradiction. Thus, having stated that qowe is a noun (esm) that has also retained its rôle as a masdar - true, if he means that it is an instance noun that may be re verbalized as qowe dâdan (2.1.1) - he describes qowat as a noun (esm) that is counter- intuitively affiliated in -at,i4 though as a mass noun of quality this is schemati- cally affiliated as one would expect (as is the contrasting qowe). Sâdeqi notes that some loanwords currently assimilated as -at (he lists eleven) appear in some Classical Persian texts as -e' in Form and Meaning, I also noted ten such occurrences, only one of which ( mojâhede ) is common to both lists.15 Do these counterexamples invalidate the characterization of the well-attested historical shift -at &gt; -e as a one-way loss of final /t/? I think not. There is good reason to regard them as either ghost words or fossils of evolutionary dead ends. First, in earlier manuscripts, Arabic feminine-ending loanwords in Persian are sometimes written with the tâ ' marbûta instead of final tâ this hybrid graph in turn is sometimes written without its superscript dots, appearing as a final hâ in which case it is impossible to know for sure whether it represents a true -e or an original -at. In texts where the same word is found elsewhere with ortho- graphic -at, we may assume this is the norm. Unfortunately, subsequent copyists (or editors) may have normalized an anomalous -e or tâ ' marbûta as -at or -e on their own initiative. I suspect that this cycle of orthographic laxity and hyper- correction is responsible for a good many ghost words in -e. However, there are certainly cases where an anomalous -e is obviously intended, as, e.g., in a line of verse where -at would not rhyme or scan (roxse for roxsat 'leave, furlough' in Hafez).16 A number of such words (e.g., hekâye, torbe, masâfe, mawhebe) did in fact shift to -e in the lexicons of adjacent dia- lects or languages - Persian of Central Asia, Afghanistan and India, Turkish, Urdu, etc. (6.1). Their occurrence in earlier literary Persian might be termed a case of 'arrested shift', in that they evolved in some idiolect or dialect of Persian in addition to, or instead of, the -at reflex, but were not accepted into the literary standard. 14 Ibid., respectively 34 and 36. 1 5 Ibid., 4 1 ; Perry, Form and Meaning, 1 26-8. 16 Ibid., 126, citing M.

Such 'discarded doublets' are not unusual where the surviving form is the shifted -e (see below), but quite rare when the survivor is the 'primitive' -at. A plausible candidate is mojâhedat/-e 'struggle, endeavor': this pair appears to have had two distinct connotations, the military-political mojâhedat + V 'fighting for one's liberty, religion, etc.; crusading, crusade', and the ascetic-mystical mojâhede + N 'strenuous religious devotion, self-mortifica- tion' . Such a split would neatly differentiate the two senses (communal warfare on the infidel, vs. individual struggle against one's lusts) which the Sufis attrib- ute to A. jihâd/P. jeháď, this word, of course, as the alternative Theme III masdar of the root J HD, is theoretically a synonym of mujâhada[t ], but is incapable of a similar differentiation. The split would also parallel the distinction seen in morâqebat +V 'observation, supervision' vs. morâqebe +N 'devout contemplation' (2.1): in each case, a Grundbedeutung in -at would have evolved a specialized connotation in -e for an ascetic, devotional or Sufi context. However, the evidence presently to hand does not support a consistent distinc- tion in usage: though 'Attâr uses mojâhede in the ascetic sense, Rumi has it in its military connotation, and Sa'di in its basic or neutral sense. Subsequent exam- ples show the -at reflex in all senses. More numerous are the 'discarded doublets' where the - at reflex is now obsolete or archaic, but may for a limited period have constituted a synchronic contrast with the surviving reflex in -e. The well-known edâre (+ V, + N) 'man- agement, administration; office' began its career as edârat, but only in the literal Arabic sense of 'passing round (wine cups, etc.)', as attested up to ca. 1280; the shifted form in -e as the figurative action and instance noun 'administration, etc.' appears some time thereafter, but was not extended to the locus noun 'office' until the late nineteenth century. Similarly, Arabic hášiya 'fringe, border (of a garment); followers, retinue; margin (of a text), marginal note' was incorporated into Persian with the two figurative senses, pragmatically differentiated for several centuries as hášeyat 'retinue, courtiers' (Bayhaqi and Nâser-e Xosraw, late 11th century) and hâseye (pi havâsi ) 'marginal note' (widespread, from the outset). By the thirteenth century, both meanings were represented by the -e reflex.17 5.4 Other non-doublets: Sâdeqi includes among his doublets two pairs which, like the discarded doublets above, may once have exhibited the contrasts he claims, but no longer do so. The archaic morâfe'at 'litigation', according to the dictionaries, had already shifted to -e before acquiring its additional vernacular sense 'dispute, quarrel', and both senses are now encoded in the surviving morâfe'e (but cf. da'vâ/da'vi, 6.2). In ezâfat 'increase; relation' (general or philosophical usage) vs. ezâfe 'annexation, noun phrase construct' (grammati- cal), a past synchronic contrast is unlikely, since ezâfat is also attested earlier as " Ibid., 128.

PERRY the grammatical term (and survives in this form and sense in Turkish and Urdu), while ezâfe in modern Persian has taken over not only the grammatical sense but the base meaning 'addition, increase'.18 A phenomenon which seems superficially similar to the 'discarded dou- blet' syndrome, yet is interestingly different, is what we might call the 'post- shift neologism': in this case an original -at form shifts (with the same or similar meaning) to -e' subsequently an unconnected neologism homonymous with the -e form enters the lexicon through some other process. Three distinct words are involved; the fact that the -at form and the neologism in -e contrast semantically is purely coincidental, and synchronically irrelevant - as is the fact that the earlier shift-reflex in -e clashes with the homonymous neologism. Thus mozâre- bat 'fencing, duel(ing)' is also found in a shifted form mozârebe, even before the invention of a homonymous mozârebe 'commandite, limited company' in the nineteenth century. The latter was a backformation from the participle mozâreb 'fellow-duelist, sparring partner; business partner', probably coined in the Ottoman empire and later imported into Iran together with the kind of commercial organization it referred to.19 Likewise, Classical Persian jabhat (later &gt; jabhe) 'brow, forehead', a poetical loan from Arabic, is not the source of modern jabhe 'front' (military or political). The fact that the military term em- ploys the same anthropomorphic trope in modern Arabic and Turkish - but is not recorded as a metaphor of jabha[t]/jabhe in pre-modern Arabic, Turkish or Persian - reveals it as a caique on French front 'brow, forehead; (battle)front' which was introduced (again, probably through Ottoman Turkish) in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century.20 6 Comparison with Other Categories of Doublets 6.1 Feminine-Ending Doublets in Tajik, Turkish, etc.: Even before attempts were made to analyse the -at/- e dichotomy in Persian or Turkish, it was recog- nised that the affiliation of individual loanwords did not always correspond in the two languages. Sâdeqi likewise lists fourteen examples of differently-affili- ated loans in Persian of Central Asia (Tajik) and of Afghanistan (Dari or Kabo- li).21 Does this difference reflect a continuation (even a refinement, or extension) of the functional scheme evident in Persian, is it an accident, or is it the product of a different system? In chapter seven of Form and Meaning , I examined differences in affilia- tion not only in the languages mentioned but also in several Turkic languages, Urdu and Hindi, and Malay and Indonesian. I concluded, first, that the superfi- cially similar -at/-a distinctions in the Arabic loan inventories of Malay-Indone- 18 Sâdeqi, 142; Perry, Form and Meaning, 68, 70, 144. 19 Perry, Form and Meaning, 68. 20 Ibid., 119, 122, 123. 21 Sâdeqi, 41-2.

Since these languages did not acquire the bulk of their Arabic loan vocabulary through Persian, this was to be expected. Some borrowings in -at have evidently been passed on ready-processed from Persian (more specifi- cally, Indo-Persian) sources; others have been taken directly from Arabic in a pre-juncture context where final /t/ is articulated; while the -a loans have mostly been taken directly from an Arabic pre-pausal form in /a/, though some may have come through Indo-Persian assimilated forms in -e. The moieties, however, reflect either accidents of etymology or phonotactic requirements of the host language, not the semantic or syntactic functional split seen in Persian. The only doublet split noted for Malay-Indonesian that does indeed have a lexically disambiguative value is sunnah 'Islamic tradition, orthodoxy' vs. sunnat 'ortho- dox rite; circumcision': the first is directly from Arabic (either in isolation or abstracted from the construct ahlu'l-sunna 'the orthodox community'), and the second either from the construct sunnatu'l-nabi 'the normative practice of the Prophet' or, more likely, through (Indo-)Persian sonnat, where the specialized sense 'circumcision' was already established.22 On the other hand, the Iranian, Turkic and Indie languages in the eastern continental Islamic ecumene did acquire virtually the whole of their Arabic vocabulary from the mots savants already assimilated into Persian; the identity of the respective -at/-e moieties is more than ninety percent preserved. Allowing for some imprecision in allocating pairs to the synchronic or diachronic/asym- metrical categories, Tajik and Dari each have about ten fully distinctive syn- chronic doublet pairs, or one-third the number in Persian; unknown to Persian are three of these in Tajik, and at least one in Dari. Five pairs (50%) in each language are not identical. Urdu likewise has ten such pairs, three of them un- known to Persian: these are kefâyat (+ V) 'sufficiency; suitability, competence' vs. kefâye 'enough' (as a predicative adjective and adverb; the same as Tajik), âle 'instrument, tool' vs. âlat 'penis' (the same as Dari, though with a tendency to reverse the -at/-e affiliation) and ezâfe/ezâfat (the same as Turkish, cf. below).23 Turkish has about fifteen, or half the number of doublets in Persian, though at least six of them are unknown to Persian. Examples of the latter are azimet (+ V) 'resolution, undertaking, setting out' vs. azime (+ N) 'incantation, spell; amulet, mascot' (schematically disambiguating a radical homonym which appears only as -at in Persian); muadelet (+ V) 'equivalence, equalization' vs. muadele 'an equation' (a schematic split; both are -e in Persian); hareket (+ V) 'movement, start' vs. hareke 'vowel diacritic', and the similar izafe (+V) 'annexation; extra' vs. izafet 'noun phrase construction' (pragmatic splits; note that in the last two examples the -at/-e affiliations are reversed in respect of the 22 Perry, Form and Meaning, 143-5, 157. » Ibid., 144-5.

PERRY basic meaning and the grammatical term, and cf. 5. 4). 24 Glancing at several other Turkic languages (Azerbaijani, Chuvash, Kazakh, Kirgiz, and Volga Tatar) we find eight widely-shared feminine-ending loan doublets unknown in Persian, three of which are different from the non-Persian pairs in Turkish; seven of those occurring in Uzbek are shared with Tajik.25 Two other widely-shared splits not occurring in Persian (or Urdu) are worth mentioning as clear semantic distinctions, functionally well-motivated in accordance with the 'Persian' system: 'ebâratZ-e (Tajik, Dari, Turkish, Azer- baijani, Tatar, Uzbek) and ģāyat/-e (Tajik, Dari, Turkish, Uzbek). Calqued on the Arabic idiom ' ibârat[an ] 'ân 'an expression of, i.e. 'which is to say, com- prising', 'ebârat + ablative pre- or postposition (' ebârat az, -dan 'ebârat, -se ' ebârat ) are used adverbially and predicatively to mean 'consisting of, consists of. In Persian and Urdu, 'ebârat is also used as the count noun of instance 'phrase, expression, idiom'; in Dari, Tajik and the Turkic languages, however, this slot is occupied by the shifted doublet 'ebâre. Similarly, gâyat 'limit, ex- tremity; utmost, extreme(ly)' is virtually universal, and in Persian and Urdu also represents the figurative sense 'end (in view), purpose, aim, ideal'; in Tajik, to an extent in Dari, and in the Turkic languages where this sense is represented, it takes the shifted form ģāye.26 It seems evident that literary Persian, though the originator and dissemina- tor of the -at/-e system, has not adopted or preserved all the splits that were realised at various times, in different regions of the Persian-writing (but Iranic-, Turkic-, Indic-speaking) world. In the case of Turkic, at least, it is possible to go beyond this conservative observation and argue that the system was actively extended. Evidence is furnished not only by the relatively large number of such doublets foreign to both Persian and Urdu, but also by the general propensity for doublet-formation in the Turkic languages, from both native stock and loan- words, which exceeds that of Persian and Urdu in quantity and ingenuity: exam- ples are Turkish (and Azerbaijani) ki'šlak ( gīšlag ) 'winter pasture' vs. kisla ( gīšla ) 'barracks'; Azerbaijani nägl 'transportation' vs. nagil '(fairy )tale' (both &lt; Ar. naql)' widespread pâdisâh 'emperor' vs. pâsâ 'chief, governor' (Turkish), poššo 'part of name' (Uzbek), etc. (&lt; Persian pādšāh' though pâsâ or other ver- nacular variants do not surface in literary Persian).27 A singularly elegant indication that the system was intuitively understood and exploited at least as well by Ottoman lexicographers as by their Persian counterparts is furnished by maxâfat/-e (4.1). None of the Persian dictionaries I have consulted admits a semantic distinction between the reflexes. However, in 24 Ibid.; John R.

It may be doubted whether such schematic clarity can be applied to actual usage in modern Persian (or even in Ottoman Turkish), but the entry, even if pedantic, demonstrates recognition of a case of derivational homonymy which could, ideally, be resolved by the -at/-e dichotomy. 6.2 Other forms of doublets in Persian: Apart from the -at/-e pairs, there are hardly any doublets of either native words or borrowings in Persian. Only one synchronic semantic contrast of the type illustrated under 2.1 comes to mind: da'vâ 'litigation, lawsuit; quarrel' vs. da'vi 'claim, pretension' (both &lt; Ar. da'vâ, written with alif maqsûra, 'claim, lawsuit'). Da'vi (written with yâ' and so pronounced in modern Persian: a spelling-pronunciation) is apparently the older form and meaning ('claim' as both pretension and demand), appearing abundantly in texts (especially poetry) from Daqiqi onward. Unless the final syllable is somewhere attested in rhyme position, there is no proof that it was pronounced as today, and on the contrary every reason to suppose that it was originally pronounced as da'vâ, in emulation of its etymon. Da'vâ (written in Persian with alef, a pronunciation-spelling) does not appear much before Safavid times; it would seem to have evolved as a bureaucratic-legal specialization ('claim for a debt or other right, lawsuit'), extending into the Persian and Turkish vernaculars of the time (along the same semantic lines as English argument) to mean 'quarrel, row', with verbal idioms 'to quarrel' and 'to scold'. With this last development we may compare literary morâfe'at 'litigation, lawsuit, complaint' &gt; vernacular morâfe 'e 'ditto; quarrel' (5.4), which seems not to have become a synchronic doublet pair. Three other pairs represent a registerial contrast between a literary, Arabicate standard and a vernacular, assimilated reflex. These are abu-/bu- (&lt; abû-, the Arabic kunya) as used in personal names; amir/mir 'emir' (&lt; Ar. amîr), used as substantive, appellative, and anthroponymic element; and mawlâ- /mollâ{-) 'mullah', also used in names. The members of this last pair are not distributed evenly: mawlâ- only occurs in combination, as mawlânâ (a title, with vernacular doublet mollânâ) or with a name, whereas mollā (in both written and spoken Persian) is also an independent appellative and substantive. The three vernacular doublets are rare examples of early Arabic loans where the phonotac- tic assimilation into Persian has been maintained orthographically. Examples of usage are: Abu 'Ali ebn-e Siná is Avicenna, the philosopher and physician of high Perso-Islamic culture; Bu 'Ali is his vernacular alter ego as a popular magician in a cycle of Persian folktales. 'Mulla Aly Shaw', an eighteenth-cen- tury official who is known only from European documents (i.e., in transcription Acta Orient. Hung. XLVUl, 1995</page><page sequence="24">150 J. R. PERRY from the spoken form of his name) would undoubtedly have appeared in a Persian document as Mawlâ 'Ali Šáh-, conversely we may assume that his contemporary Mawlâ Mottaleb, who appears only in Persian chronicles, would be called Mollā Mottaleb in popular speech.28 Mir was regularly used to refer to the ruler in Samanid and Ghaznavid literature (and amir could be used as a sobriquet for less exalted personages such as the poet Mu'ezzi), but thereafter the more 'cultivated' form amir was preferred for rulers, and mir was applied more often to popular saints, as Šáh Mir Hamze. Literary ostâd 'master, profes- sor' contrasts in some contexts with vernacular ostā 'master (craftsman)', but not so systematically as in Tajik or Turkish.29 An interesting 'discarded doublet' of Classical Persian, the distinction in which is maintained in Turkish, is tamyiz 'discernment, discrimination' vs. tamiz 'clean, decent': modern Persian has, unusually, established the vernacular vari- ant tamiz as the single form for both senses. On the fringe of doublethood are variants such as pârs(î)lfârs(i), pil/fih the early Classical form with p was generally superseded by an Arabicized form with /, which in turn is now liable to be replaced by p in nativist or archaizing contexts. 6.3 Analogies in other languages: Arabic, which has generously provided all the material for Persian doublets of every kind, and most of that for Turkish and Urdu, is itself devoid of true doublets by reason of the rigidity of its lexical morphology - in particular, the demands of ta'rib or assimilation of foreign vocabulary to Arabic morpholexical formulas. Languages with more elastic terms for borrowing, such as Persian, French, or English, acquire dozens of doublets - overwhelmingly of foreign origin, for 'doubling' vocabulary is a means of supplementing native morphological devices, and (as we have seen here) is intimately tied to the several historical processes of 'borrowing' words. But are these doubling processes comparable in different languages? Hušang A'lam lists a selection of French doublet pairs of the type meuble/mobile, chose/cause, noting that the first variant is the earlier vernacular descendant of Vulgar Latin vocabulary, the second is a mot savant introduced from literary Latin by scholars from the fourteenth century on; he wonders if this process has analogies in the formation of Persian doublets.30 English, too, has a similar range of doublets (and triplets) contrasting Norman French loans assimilated into Middle English with Latinate mots savcuits (and some Italian and French loans) of the Renaissance and later: frail/fragile, parson/person/per- sona, influence/influenza, etc. This historical process of supplementing early 28 Cf.

A close analogy can certainly be seen in several of the Persian feminine- ending doublets, at least in modern neologisms coined (or, more precisely, im- ported from the Ottoman realms) without direct reference to their Classical antecedents: such are jabhe 'front', mozârebe 'limited company' (5.4), and perhaps mosâhebe 'interview' (2.1). Even the vernacular ¿to 'vá, to the extent that it began as a phonetically hypercorrected, and lexically more specialized, variant of the earlier da 'vi, might be regarded as a learned suppletion. There remains the fact that in each case the earlier loan was also a mot savant in origin, and could hardly be considered more vernacular in usage than the later one. A stronger case can be made at the other end of the historical continuum. The early loans bu, mollā and mir were almost certainly incorporated orally, rather than as literary mots savants, as is evidenced by their assimilated form and social usage (as names and appellatives); thus their literary, Arabicate doublets abu, mawlâ and amir (if their first appearance was indeed in written texts, perhaps several generations after the incorporation of their doublets in spoken New Persian) are to an extent learned suppletions from a foreign source. The vast majority of (feminine-ending) doublets in Persian, however, result from the very reverse of the process seen in French or English: the earlier form is the learned term, and the later 'shifted' form is derived directly from it by a phonological and orthographic change which signals a more specialized or concrete sense, or a more idiomatic and vernacular usage. Even where the -e reflex is not derived from the -at form, but represents an independently inducted Arabic homonym (1.1, 1.2), the semantic relation often holds good: for an illiterate soldier in the Ghaznavid army, maymane 'right wing' was a more concrete, meaningful and everyday term than the pious abstraction maymanat 'felicity, good augury.' There is, however, a strong candidate for comparison on a historical, methodological and functional basis in the English stress patterns of certain disyllabic verb-noun (or adjective) pairs: convért/cónvert, convict/cónvict, recéss/récess, perféct/pérfect, affíx/áffix, contráct/cóntract, refúse/réfuse, and some 150 more.31 In each case the word with final stress is a verb, the word with initial stress is a substantive or adjective. Most are cognate and monosemous, but the last two examples illustrate homographs in which the meaning, as well as the lexical category, is distinguished by the accent ( contract 'to shrink' vs. contract 'business agreement' and refuse 'to reject' vs. refuse 'garbage' - cog- nate, but polysemous; the last additionally distinguished by a voiceless sibillant). These two pairs may be compared with the disambiguation of derivational homonyms in maymanat/-e or eqâmat/-e. How else is this system similar to the Persian one? 31 Perry, Form and Meaning, 210; Jean Aitchison, Language Change: Progress or Decay? 2nd edition, Cambridge 1991 , 82-3. Acta Orient. Hung. XLVIII. ¡995</page><page sequence="26">152 J. R. PERRY It targets borrowed (Latinate) vocabulary. It has been in action from the early period of Modern English, and is still productive; the Persian shift (of which doublet formation is a part) has been in action from the earliest period of New Persian, and is apparently still productive (4.1). The English system works by a process of lexical diffusion, schematically splitting an original homograph by means of a sound shift, the shifted stress marking the noun or adjective (the more concrete or imageable class), and the trace marking the verb (the more abstract, less imageable class). Persian shifted (i.e., nominal) forms such as esâre, eqâme, zarbe, morâje'e, havâle, 'âreye may then be reverbalized by combining with an auxiliary; English shifted forms, too, may be verbed under the same stress pattern and meaning, as to prócess (distinct from the original to procéss) and to impact (transitive; similar to the earlier impáct on, different in meaning from impácted 'crammed together'). In each case, three new lexical entries are created from a single original. The process in English would appear to be a specialized subroutine of the general tendency to 'verb' nouns without morphological change. In Persian, dis- tinguishing nominal from verbal usage in original homonyms is only one of several possible functions of the -at/-e split, and on the other hand its inventory is only one third the size of the English stress-class doublets. Elegant as it is, this contrastive marking is not strictly necessary to disambiguate usage either in English or Persian; the contextual morphology and syntax is generally sufficient (indeed, the English pairs remain undifferentiated in writing without great risk of confusion, and the shift-induced split in Persian may often be judged redundant, though less so in the case of homonyms where it is not attributable to a historical shift - at least two thirds of the fifteen items in section 1). In both systems, however, the taxonomie value of the dichotomy is intuitively satisfying. 7 Conclusions The formation of lexical doublets is evidently a sub-system of another process or processes typically at work in a particular language or culturally bound group of languages. As we see from the analogies touched on above, a historical explana- tion plausible for one group may need to be stood on its head to apply to another. Rate of change, size of inventory and type of target words may differ not only between groups but within a group. In what seems a plausible scenario for the Persian system here discussed, the superordinate process has been the assimilation of Arabic words in the feminine ending: this vocabulary (maximally, almost 2,000 items) included a disproportionately high number of desirable abstracta and culturally freighted words, and in its Arabic form was encumbered by a syntactically-determined alternation in pronunciation and orthography irrelevant to (and, indeed, inex- pressible in) Persian. The alternants were /-at / ~ /-a/, writable as -at - -a. The form -at was chosen for the majority of borrowings, which began as mots Acta Orient. Hrnu.

It so happens that, since Middle Persian postvocalic lil had become voiced by the time of the Arab invasion, terminal /-at/ was no longer in the phonotactic repertory of Persian; this aberrant ending was thus marked from the outset as proper to a class of Fremdwörter. The reflex /-a/ represented the pre-juncture pronunciation which in Arabic characterizes feminine-ending words in isolation or at the end, rather than in the middle, of a noun phrase - and was thus more frequently heard in names, glosses accompanying ostensive definition, and other paratactic utterances. It had already been chosen for a critical mass of more tangible and imageable referents borrowed into spoken New Persian, and was assimilated into the written language as -a. It so happens that in pronunciation and orthography, this substantival ending coincided exactly with the ending of a large class of native Persian substantives with similar semantic characteristics (modern nâme, bande, somare, etc.) which on the eve of the Arab conquest was about to lose a final velar, /-ag/ &gt; /-a/; this phonotactically familiar ending was thus marked from the outset as proper to vernacular words. As the more tangible or imageable -at affiliates became progressively assimilated from Fremdwort to Lehnwort status (or as they acquired more tangible or imageable figurative senses, often accom- panied by count-noun status), they tended to shift to -a as a mark of their assimilation. With this, they frequently adopted the derivational morphology of the Persian -a class, notably the fossilized velar of Middle Persian before vowel- initial suffixes ( nazzâregân 'spectators', xebregi 'expertise', etc.).32 In this way an unwieldy chunk of useful Arabic vocabulary was sorted in accordance with Persian semantic and phonotactic principles. The formation of doublets, a special case of the same process of sorting and shift, further ex- panded the existing loan vocabulary. The bulk of this growing inventory, and the rules of the system, were passed on to speakers and writers of culturally adjacent languages, who further exploited them. Since little or no Arabic vocabulary is nowadays inducted into these languages, the whole process is barely productive, even in Persian; the number of shifted forms and doublets has probably stabi- lized, or is äbout to, closing a distinctive phase of Persian lexical innovation. 32 Perry, Form and Meaning, 12-14, 189-95. Sâdeqi (43) also suggests that this class of Persian words had some influence on the shift - at &gt; -e. Acta Orient. Hung. XLVIII. 1995</page></plain_text>
