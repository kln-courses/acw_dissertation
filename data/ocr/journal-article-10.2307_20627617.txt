<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Erotic Goddess of the Syme Sanctuary, Crete ANGELIKI LEBESSI Abstract The pottery, architectural remains, and artifacts ex cavated at the interregional sanctuary at Syme on Crete document the importance and continuous use of the site from ca. 2000 B.C.E. down to the sixth/seventh century C.E. Votives of the first millennium indicate that Hermes was worshiped there together with an erotic goddess as early as the 10th century and that in the Hellenistic period, this goddess was Aphrodite. The archaeological evidence from the sanctuary is incompatible with current theories of Aphrodite's origins. Instead, it emphasizes the local factor as the motive force in the genesis of Aphrodite and the contribution made by local cults throughout Greece and Cyprus in the development of her personality.* INTRODUCTION Studies of a deity's personality rely to a significant extent on literary sources that are considered along with the material remains of the divinity's cult. This approach, which has been applied to discussions of the "Greek Aphrodite" and Hermes, draws attention to the multiplicity of meanings inherent in a deity, its relations with other gods of the Olympian pantheon, and the social factors that contributed to its forma tion.1 When, however, the chronological framework of the discussion is very early?as in the case of the Erotic Goddess, who was worshiped at the Syme sanc tuary on Crete?and there is no literary tradition, while religious beliefs and social factors are more or less unclear, there remain only two sources of infor mation that can be used to define the personality of the deity: the ritual context of her cult and her ico nography. This paper is therefore prefaced by a brief historical account of the Syme sanctuary, followed by a detailed analysis of the iconographic types of the Erotic Goddess. The interpretation of this evidence in light of the votives and inscriptions found at the sanctuary clarifies the essential nature of the divinity, leading to her assignment to a specific pantheon. A brief presentation of the features of the sanctu ary is also useful for two practical reasons. The first concerns the preliminary reports of the excavation, in which the information provided annually may appear to be dispersed and disjointed to readers who have not followed the course of the project closely. A consider able amount of the information provided by the early excavation seasons has been revised in light of later data resulting from the protracted investigation of the site, which was concluded in 2003; additional evidence has accrued from the ongoing study of the architec ture, the pottery, and the anthropomorphic terracot tas, one of which is the Erotic Goddess.2 The second reason is that the three final reports of the excavation published so far, which are devoted almost exclusively to metal votives of the first millennium, provide only a partial picture of the cult practices carried out at the sanctuary;3 the publication of other categories of ritual vessels and dedications dating from prehistoric as well as Greek times?and also of the abundant epi graphic material?is still pending. Consequently, the existing literature on the site contains some errone ous information regarding the length and relative sig nificance of the periods during which the sanctuary functioned. The same is also true of the evaluation of specific categories or individual votives gleaned from excavation reports in accordance with the interests of each scholar, as if each category or dedication were severed from its context. In terms of the modern geographical divisions of Crete, the Syme sanctuary lies on the border between the prefectures of Heraklion and Lasithi, on a southern slope of Mount Dikte, at an altitude of 1,130 mask The site is located 17 km from the small town of Viannos * I am grateful to D.

A characteristic feature of the natural setting of the sanctuary is the impressive karstic theater, which faces the Libyan Sea to the southwest and is protected on the northeast by sheer slopes. The dense, wild vegetation with the shady foliage of the trees, the age-old plane tree, and the abundant waters of the spring, which gave the site the name of Krya Vrysi, complete the present-day picture of the sanctuary (fig. 1). The location of the site on the only existing paths across the rugged mountains, the striking landscape, and the life-giving water of the spring were the primary factors that led to the establishment of the sanctuary far from all known ancient setdements. The primeval, purifying properties of the springwater (which in the first millennium was diverted into a lustral channel that flowed around the edge of the area devoted to open-air cult) and that (according to literary evidence) springs were used for purification purposes suggest that the very first open-air layout of the site, dating in Middle Minoan (MM) IA and oriented toward the spring, served cult purposes.4 In other words, the selection of the site for cult purposes was dictated by the natural environment. The desire to perpetuate the cult led to the transference of the sanctity of the site to the moun tain itself, which acquired the name Sacred Mountain (Ptol. Geog. 3.17.4). The suggestion that the place name derives from the sacred territory owned by the sanctuary seems less likely, since the name occurs only once on Crete (as also in Thrace and Asia Minor), al though other more prominent Cretan sanctuaries did own private land.5 The earliest evidence of human intervention in the sloping plateau of the site dates to ca. 2100/2000 B.C.E., according to traditional Minoan chronology. From this time on, the attendance of pilgrims at the site was uninterrupted until the Early Christian era (sixth/seventh century C.E.). The continuous use of the site is documented by the pottery as well as by the sequence of the more or less extensive roofed and open-air structures of the second and first millennia, which occupy a 3,000 m2 area, although the boundar ies of the precinct have yet to be determined (fig. 2). The site itself, the architectural remains, the artifacts, and the epigraphic evidence from various periods of its existence define the interregional character of the sanctuary,6 whose status in east and central Crete was Fig. 1. Aerial view of the Syme sanctuary and its surround ings (Syme Excavation archive). reduced to that of a cult site of local interest only in the first century C.E.7 Although the use of the site for cult purposes was uninterrupted over the course of 27 centuries, there were many changes in its architectural organization and the behavior of the pilgrims in both the second and first millennia. It is beyond the scope of this in troduction to enumerate all these changes, and thus only sharp divisions at the ritual, ideological, and so cial level are noted. From the Middle Minoan period down to the fourth century, cult activity in the open comprised sacrifices, ritual banquets, libations, and offerings made of mate rials that have endured over time.

Letters indicate building names (Syme Excavation archive). are the same in both millennia, but the votives and cultic vessels demonstrate that the significance of the ritual banquets and the nature of the rites changed from the second to the first millennium, as did the re lationship between the worshipers and the divine.8 In contrast, while the relationship between mortal and deity remained unchanged during the first mil lennium, the ritual did change: from the Hellenistic period on, the rites were transferred from the open to the interior of small house shrines. Any continuity or change at the ritual level, therefore, depended more on contemporary social factors than on the way the worshipers perceived the divine. A sharp division in the relationship between humans and the divine can be detected at the transition from the second to the first millennium and again from the Roman period to Early Christian times. In the second millennium, the deity was approached mainly through rituals, as is clear from the enormous number of ritual vases, such as the hundreds of libation tables made of stone or the even more numerous chalices and other cups, made usually of clay, sometimes of stone and, more rarely, of precious materials. The presence of the votaries is hinted at by a few male figurines or re flected in a number of dedications of valuable materials by representatives of the male sex from the Neopala tial period on.9 The scarcity and homogeneity of the figurines, which are all of the "adorant" type, makes it impossible to determine the attributes or the sex of the deity honored. It is possible that it may have been male, if we accept that the gender of the deity is re flected in the gender of the votives. From the end of Late Minoan (LM) IIIC to the first millennium and thereafter, the picture gradually changes. The vases are now few and utilitarian, while the number of ritual vessels made of clay is negligible. 8Lebessi 1991b. 9 Lebessi 2002b, 32-54, nos. 1-8, pis. 1-8.

The virtual absence of female representations among the bronze figurines, as well as the bronze cutout plaques, indicates that offering metal votives was a privilege confined to prominent males and did not extend to women, who dedicated objects of clay.10 The differentiation of the dedications according to distinct social groups helps distinguish the mortal from the divine figures represented on the votives. At the same time, it enables us to define the personality of the gods honored here, who gave the site the label Sanctuary of Hermes and Aphrodite, even though this name, which is applicable only to the Greek-Roman phase of the site, casts into the shade the Minoan past of the sanctuary, with the result that its importance during the second millennium has been underestimated by Minoan scholars. The worship of Hermes is documented by epigraph ic evidence as early as the sixth century; his epithet, Kedrites?which connects him with the cedar tree and is unique as an epithet of Hermes11?occurs on graffiti of the Hellenistic period, as does the name Aphrodite (see below, under "The Name of the Erotic Goddess"). Both deities, however, can be traced back to the 10th century on the evidence of the votive objects. There is no evidence for the name of the saint hon ored by the worshipers who built two small, successive Early Christian churches. Their orientation was dif ferent from that of the earlier buildings, which were all linked directly or indirectly with the spring. This change and, more significantly, the use of the site for the burial of a woman, signal a second religious/ide ological division at this long-lived site, occurring be tween the Roman period and the Christian era.12 The only feature of the sanctuary that remained virtually unchanged over the centuries was the natural environment. The sloping terrain imposed the same so lutions in different periods, such as the use of stepped terraces in the arrangement of open areas; it did not, however, stand in the way of the more drastic modi fication of the ground when in early MM III the new building type of the monumental Sacred Enclosure was constructed to accommodate outdoor cult activ ity.13 Thus, while the natural environment may have influenced the choice and preservation of the site, the architectural remains attest to the different ways hu man intervention impacted the natural environment in different periods.14 THE EROTIC GODDESS: TYPES AND INTERPRETATION The published assemblages of 96 bronze cutout plaques and 32 bronze anthropomorphic figurines of the first millennium provide invaluable information. Many examples of both categories demonstrate that Cretan youths celebrated the transition from adoles cence to adulthood at the sanctuary, with Hermes Kedrites as their patron god.15 By the same token, di vine protection would have been equally essential for the females who congregated in the sanctuary from the early first millennium on. Thus, we expect a cor responding goddess at the site who would attend to the female votaries and receive clay votives. There are 157 preserved and identifiable clay anthro pomorphic votives of various categories from Syme that range in date from the early Protogeometric period down to the fourth century. Of these, 46 depict?in the round or in relief?a standing female figure, either nude or clothed, in frontal stance. Two singular and rare iconographic types, represented by three votives (HM 20020, HM 20030, HM 20037), stand out among them and are presented here ahead of the publication of the whole assemblage because they shed light not only on the presence of women?which, from the early first millennium on, was just as dynamic as that of men at the Syme sanctuary?but also on the deity who was the recipient of the terracotta votives. Since all three objects were found in unstratified cultic deposits, they are dated on stylistic criteria that are not discussed here. Given the close connections in material and decoration between terracottas and pottery, the dates assigned are those used for the pot tery assemblages from the North Cemetery at Knossos, where the Sub-Minoan period is dated 1100-970, and the early phase of the Protogeometric style is 970-920. The earlier, xoanomorphic, type (HM 20020) can be dated to 970-950 at the latest. The later type (HM 20037), known to scholarship as the anasyrma type,16 can be readily assigned to the Middle Dedalic phase. The Xoanomorphic Type The female figure HM 20020 draws both individual formal features and also painted characteristics from 10Lebessi 1985b, 188-98; 2002b, 264-67. 11 On the inscription (5EG26 1046), the epithet is spelled Kedritas; see also LSJ Suppl., s.v.

Its static pose with arms held close to the body contrasts with the unstable posture of the flat-bodied parallels and their active gestures. The volume of the body of the Syme figurine is also rendered differendy: the gradual flaring out from the shoulders toward the flat surface, on which the figure is supported, gives the form of the body the value of a full-length garment.19 The tiny hole in the center of the head for an attached object does not occur in the extant figurines from Anavlochos. The dress of HM 20020 is a kind of overgarment folded on the nape and fastened at the front, as is shown by the vertical painted band that starts between the naked conical breasts and runs in an irregular path down to the hem. At the sides of the back, there are also two broad, vertical bands that emphasize the loose form of the garment, and the relief fold on the nape gives an impression of the weight associated with densely woven garments (see fig. 4). There is an incompatibility between the naked breasts and the fastened garment. This same incom patibility means that the large pubic triangle is visible despite the dress, and it is framed by the converging hands of the figure. This unrealistic treatment of the garment defines it as a ritual one, although it can not yet be identified with any of the sacred garments known from literary sources.20 The exposure of the breasts in otherwise clothed female figures is a distinctive Minoan feature and has no precise parallels in the Near East or in archaic Greece. It is worth noting that this motif did not dis appear when Minoan naturalism came to an end, for it is still found in the contracted volume of the naked breasts of schematic LM III figurines and of Myce naean figurines from Phylakopi on Melos. It survives in early first-millennium Crete in the Protogeometric figurine HM 20020 from Syme and becomes more common in Cretan figurines of the seventh century; Fig. 3. The xoanomorphic type of the Erotic Goddess (HM 20020) (Syme Excavation archive). it also occurs sporadically in some terracottas from the Samian Heraion.21 The appearance of the pubic triangle, however, is foreign to LM III iconography. The demonstrative placement of the hands of HM 20020 around the pubic triangle is found in a "unique"22 representation of a nude moldmade kourotrophos figure of the 13th cen tury from Palestine, which has been identified with the goddess Atirat/Asherah. The rarity of the eastern par allel and its considerably earlier date make it unlikely that the gesture was a loan from the Near East. It is possible that certain stimuli from the southeast Medi terranean basin influenced the gesture of HM 20020, since in the Early Iron Age, there are nude female figures from the Near East who cover their pudenda with both hands to indicate modesty.23 In the Cretan figurine, however, the motif of covering the pudenda is replaced by a gesture that draws attention to them; 17HM 20020: ht. 14 cm; fine, well-fired fabric of pinkish hue (5YR 7/4); traces of black and yellowish-brown paint; right arm and part of left restored (illustrated in Lebessi 1972,198, pi. 187a). ,8Demargne 1931,388-89, figs. 24,26, nos. 11,12; 393, fig. 29c; Woodward 1927-1928,76,82, fig. 4, nos. 20,21. 19 On the relationship of sculpture with wood-carved im ages, see Donohue 1988,206-18,231. 20 Infra n. 46. 21 Rizza and Santa Maria Scrinari 1968, pl. 13, no. 71; pl. 19, no. 106 (Cretan); French 1985, figs. 6.1-3, 6.7, 6.9 (My cenaean); Rethemiotakis 1998, figs. 28,42, 73 (Minoan).

Painted details of HM 20020 (Syme Excavation archive). also striking is the shaping of the hands that are the same as those of Postpalatial figurines.24 Insofar as I know, the motif of the exposure of the fe male pudenda over a full-length garment is not found in the Near East or in Egypt. Pudenda indicated in re lief over a female garment occur on a Mycenaeanizing terracotta figure of LH HIB from Phylakopi on Melos and also in a later (?) figure from Enkomi on Cyprus.25 The transference of this rare motif from either Melos or Cyprus is equally likely, given the frequent commu nications between these areas and Crete in LMIIIB-C and the ideological convergences that the spread of the Mycenaean koine facilitated.26 The horizontal bands encircling the head, face, neck, and lower body, and also the two bands binding the arms to the body, do not form part of the painted details of the garment, and they have their roots in the second millennium. The closest iconographic parallel is found in four figures of the Goddess with Upraised Arms from the shrine at Gazi (Heraklion) and in four others of the same type from the communal shrine at Karphi, which cover the interval from the end of LM HIB down to the Sub-Minoan period. The bands on figurines of the Goddesses with Up raised Arms have been identified as decorative at tachments on their clothing;27 but this identification cannot be valid, since the painted bands encircling the cylindrical skirt, the upper torso, and the arms are also wound around the neck, face, and head of the figures. The crossing of these bands on the nape, preserved on a figure from Gazi, clearly indicates that they must be bonds (fig. 5). HM 20020 is also bound, but in a way that is adapted to the new iconographic type and to the Protogeomet ric style of the figurine. The type and period also ac count for the two bands placed vertically on the front of the neck, which form a clumsy link between the bands around the head and the horizontal binding of the arms to the body (see fig. 4). The bands used to bind the figure's arms have a clearly different value from the (also thin) horizontal, decorative lines be tween the two vertical bands on the rear of the figure. 24E.g., Rethemiotakis 1998, pl. 32, no. 10. 25French 1985, 211, fig. 6.3, pl. 34 (SF2658); Karageorghis 1993,26-7,29-30, fig. 6, pl. 17. 26 For imported pottery on Crete, see Rehak and Younger 1998,162-64,170; Rutter 1999,143-48. 27Rethemiotakis 1998, 80-4, 87-8,115, nos. 23, 25-7, figs. 52,53,57, cat. nos. 17-20.</page><page sequence="7">2009] THE EROTIC GODDESS OF THE SYME SANCTUARY, CRETE 527 Some Hellenistic stone statues of male or female dei ties also feature arms bound to the body. That these come from the islands of the northeast Aegean and from Asia Minor suggests a Near Eastern origin for this practice.28 The bonds of the Cretan Protogeomet ric figurine, however, do not fit this pattern, for they have immediate precedents, both in time and place, in LM IIIB-Sub-Minoan figures. This indicates that the binding of the divine image reflects a belief that was rooted in Minoan cult practice. All the comparanda leave no doubt about the divine nature of the Syme figure who is swathed in bonds. Her erotic character, which is evident from the dis play of the large pudenda, is equally clear, while her small, naked breasts make it highly unlikely that she also incorporated the aspect of the nurturing mother goddess. Her innovative features suggest that her bind ing functions on a ritual level. In sanctuaries such as that at Syme, which were in continuous use from the second to the first millennium, adherence to a ritual served as a bridge between past and contemporary perceptions of the deity. This bridging of the past and present was a Panhellenic phenomenon, as the old, frequently incomprehensible, epithets attached to the names of the Olympian gods suggest.29 Thus, the binding of the Erotic Goddess, as we call her, was part of her ritual identity at Syme and did not interfere with the new perception of the divine in the first millennium. Unlike the representations of the Goddess with Upraised Arms that crowd her shrines, the Erotic Goddess is unique in her sanctu ary; this suggests a new relationship between the wor shipers and the deity. Her iconographic type finds no parallel in the iconography either of Crete or the rest of Greece. More significantly, parallels are not even present at the Syme sanctuary where HM 20020 was dedicated, despite the fact that the individual female figure is found in abundance among the terracottas there. Thus we have, for the first time, iconographic evidence for the essential difference between the LM III figures of the Goddess with Upraised Arms and a unique cult image of the first millennium, which was, as is described by Homer, housed in a temple and was cared for by a priesthood.30 The Erotic Goddess HM 20020 is, then, a distinct type, which could not have emerged out of nowhere. Surely the Cretan coroplast had a model at the site, since the figurine type is unique even for the sanctu Fig. 5. Goddess with Upraised Arms from Gazi (after Reth emiotakis 1998, fig. 53; courtesy G. Rethemiotakis). ary in which it was dedicated. The flat body of the Protogeometrie figurine, its stance and gesture, the ritual garment and the binding, are all features of xoanomorphic cult statues. It is therefore probable that the figurine was modeled on a cult xoanon that existed at the sanctuary.31 It is impossible to determine the size and material of the cult image of the Syme sanctuary. In literary tradi tion, such early cult images are referred to indiscrimi nately by the words agalma, xoanon, hedos, or bretas, although they have all come to be called xoanon in the relevant literature. Similarly, xoana do not have a standard location in all sanctuaries; sometimes they are displayed in a house shrine, and at other times they are transported to an open-air location. The only constant feature is the antiquity of the xoanon; only a few xoana were bound.32 We do know, however, that bound cult statues of late antiquity were kept perma nently in sanctuaries. An early Protogeometric date for HM 20020 would place the presumed xoanon of the Erotic Goddess at the beginning of the first millennium. At this time, evi dence from the sanctuary favors its having been kept in a roofed space, such as the small bipartite roofed Building L, which was used from late LM III/Sub Minoan down to the Geometric period (see fig. 2). In the Protogeometric period, an altar was erected ap proximately 8 m east of Building L, and a paved area was created between them (fig. 6). 28 Fleischer 1973, 336-402 (with a critique of the views re lating to the origins of binding); Icard-Gianolio 2004,468-69; Despinis 2007. 29Jost 1985,455. 30Gladigow 1990,100-4. 31 Alroth 1989,15-18.

Architectural remains of the Protogeometric period at Syme: 1, Building L; 2, platform; 3, altar; 4, bench; A, LM I building; B, Late Geometric altar; C, MM IB-MM II building (courtesy N. Zariphis). Binding and loosing the divine bonds is referred to in Greek myth as a single act, but at the cult level it as sumed the form of a ritual action repeated at specified times.33 At the Syme sanctuary, this could have been done repeatedly by the human representative of the Erotic Goddess in the area west of the altar, without moving the xoanon. The ritual binding and loosing that occurred at Syme is indicated by the presence of votives in the sanctuary depicting various ritual acts. Figures, modeled in the round or in relief and dated from the second half of the ninth century onward, are shown pouring libations, sacrificing a wild goat on a table, or opening their garments behind an altar (fig. 7) (see below, under "The Anasyrma Type").34 Dating the assumed xoanon to 970-950 also calls into question two established views: that cult images emerged along with large-scale sculpture and monu mental temples in the late eighth century, and that epic poetry, where the concept of the temple as the permanent residence of the deity is perceptible,35 re flects contemporary reality. We must remember, how ever, that the temple at Dreros is not monumental, nor do the cult figures that were housed in it represent monumental sculpture; and the date of epic poetry is disputed.36 The archaeological record, then, does not preclude the possibility that there were cult images in Crete earlier than the eighth century.37 In any event, the construction of a cult image, which reflected the religious beliefs of one or more commu nities in any area of the Greek world, did not require the institution of the polis to protect the sanctity of the image within a roofed building. The ritual gar ment and the binding of the small-scale version of the xoanon HM 20020 are iconographic indications that correspond with the measures taken to protect cult images: dressing, binding, and keeping them in a shrine.38 Nor does the early date of this figurine present a problem.

The ritual cleansing of the xoanon with seawater is alluded to by the addition of a fish under the handle of the vase. This scene can hardly be ascribed to the inventive imagination of the vase painter or to the imitation of non-Cretan prototypes;39 rather, it is pow erful evidence for the existence of xoana in Crete in the ninth century, as well as for the existence of ritual activities and for the suitability of depicting such ritual activities on pottery and in other media. Who dedicated HM 20020 at Syme? I argue that this copy of the xoanon of the Erotic Goddess was dedicated by a woman. It is probable that she was an eminent representative of the female community, perhaps even the priestess of the Erotic Goddess who may have performed the annual ritual of the binding and loosing of the bonds. The Anasyrma Type The iconographic type of the anasyrma?that is, of the standing, frontal female figure who reveals her pu denda by drawing aside her garment?occurs at Syme in two versions represented by two dedications. In ver sion A, on the Middle Dedalic plaque HM 20037, the female figure wears an imposing wreath and stands alone in the field of the plaque (fig. 8) .40 In version B, on the early Late Dedalic plaque HM 20030, the figure is doubled, the gesture is modified, and a "hill-shaped" type altar appears in the foreground, concealing the feet of the two identical figures (see fig. 7) .41 The anasyrma type, which is common on Near East ern seals throughout the second millennium, has been debated at length, as has its short-lived influence on Cretan art.42 The question of its transfer from the Near East of the second millennium to Crete of the seventh century remains open. Of the two examples noted by B?hm as the only typological parallels for the two Cre tan versions, one is of doubtful authenticity; the sec ond, the isolated figure on a 10th-century orthostate from Carchemish, is the latest example of a series of similar representations of the second millennium, and its gesture is not of the anasyrma type.43 Fig. 7. The ritual of anasyrma on plaque HM 20030 (Syme excavation archive). Consequently, the late admission of this exotic type in Cretan iconography must be acribed to local fac tors. These must have been mainly ideological, since the new type corresponded to that of the established goddess of the sanctuary, in that the gesture of reveal ing the genitals by means of the anasyrma motif on HM 20037 and displaying them on top of the garment of HM 20020 had the same meaning. The chronological factor also must have played a role, since the introduc tion of the anasyrma motif coincides in time with the dynamic activity of the Cretan workshops in the seventh century, which transformed external stimuli into their own iconographic types with an independent semiotic content.44 Therefore, the exotic anasyrma type was ad opted in order to modernize the old, bound Erotic Goddess HM 20020 in response to the dictates of the orientalizing style (see figs. 3, 7).

The covering of the shoulders leaving the arms exposed in HM 20037 recalls the well known Cretan overgarment (epiblema).46 The belted, full-length ritual garment with the sides drawn open is the same as the full-length garment depicted as fas tened on a series of Middle Dedalic plaques from a cultic deposit at Siteia (fig. 10). In the standing female figure of the Siteia plaques, the thin raised rib, running vertically from the gap between the exposed breasts, branches downward into a horizontal straight line and a shorter curved one, distinguishing the covered side of the garment from the covering one and allowing the hem of a second, inner garment to be seen. It is Fig. 9.

This garment is perhaps to be identified with the dipterygon mentioned in literary sources.47 It is obvious that the subject of the representation determined the closing or opening of the two sides of the ritual garment. The passive stance of the figure from Siteia and the binding of the Protogeometric HM 20020 made it impossible to depict the garment with open sides. The seventh-century craftsman, however, was not similarly constrained when he depicted the same ritual garment with open sides and so revealed the pudenda of HM 20037, who can thus be identi fied as an erotic goddess as well. Indeed, on the more sharply impressed figure from Axos, the open sides also frame the upper part of the nude torso, which, in the contemporary figure from Siteia, is covered by the closed ritual garment, leaving only the breasts ex posed (see figs. 9, 10). 45Rizza 1967-1968,238, fig. 12, no. 86a-h; 293. 46Davaras 1972,26-8. 47LSJ, s.v.

All that changes is the rela tionship of the hands to the garment, the open sides of which are pulled aside to reveal the pudenda of the later figure. The slighdy modified gesture, combined with the traditional ritual garment, thus creates a completely different motif from the Near Eastern god desses of the second millennium, who, with their arms raised and bent at the elbow, draw up their garment, which has been contracted into a garland.48 The divine nature of the erotic figure HM 20037 is not evident a priori simply because her gesture and garment are the same as those of the bound Erotic Goddess HM 20020. The nature of any figure earlier than the sixth century is difficult to define on icono graphic evidence alone because body language is the same in both mortal and divine figures.49 The mean ing of symbols is also ambiguous, since, according to literary sources, divine garments, the polos, and the wreath were also worn by mortals when they were par ticipating in rituals.50 A better method for defining an isolated figure on a dedication is to compare it with figures of the same type, similarly depicted on contem porary votives, rather than with typological parallels from another period or culture. This approach can be applied in the case of the anasyromene figure of plaque HM 20037, since this rare type is to be found in the almost contemporary version B on plaque HM 20030 and since both were dedicated in the same cult place. That figure HM 20037 reveals her own pudenda (see fig. 8), coupled with the iso lation of the figure on the plaque, individualizes the act of anasyrma. In contrast, the reduplication of the same type in the representation of HM 20030 (see fig. 7), in which the gesture of the two figures is modified, the arms crossing as each reveals the other's pudenda with adjacent hands, gives a feeling of reciprocity and collective participation in the same ritual. The narra tive scheme of the gesture clearly distinguishes the double figures on the Syme plaque from the type of Geometric and archaic figurines of "double" females or males, who stand upright or are seated, or move as autonomous divine beings.51 Another substantial difference between the two Syme versions of the same iconographic type is that the space of the ritual Fig. 10. Plaque of the Middle Dedalic period from Siteia (courtesy V. Zervaki). anasyrma remains undefined in the representation of the isolated figure, whereas in the second version it is signaled as an earthly, sacred location by the hill shaped altar that hides their feet, as though the ritual anasyrma were taking place behind the notional focus of the open-air cult area. The difference between the two versions of the anasyrma type is also delineated in the individual iconographic features of the figures. HM 20037 and the similar figure from Axos have full breasts and a distended pubes (see figs. 8, 9). These biological features suggest a more mature age than that of the double figures HM 20030, with their slender, youth ful bodies. The uncovered heads of the latter are also appropriate to their youth and contrast with the im posing wreath, decorated with fruit (?), that is worn by the figure on HM 20037. Even the larger size of HM 20037, in comparison with the smaller size of the two figures on HM 20030, serves to underline her tran scendental nature. 48Winter 1983, figs. 267-305. 49 Neumann 1965,1-5. 50Connorl987,45,49. 51 Lebessi 2002b, 261-62 nn. 1088-89, pls. 18,19, nos. 19, 20.</page><page sequence="12">532 ANGELIKI LEBESSI [AJA 113 All the iconographic elements of the two versions of the anasyrma type from Syme and Axos lead to the identification of the figure HM 20037 as an erotic god dess. At the same time, they suggest that the anasyrma ritual, as performed by the mortals depicted on HM 20030, involved a young female who, unlike a married woman, may not yet have been integrated into the social fabric and was not allowed to address the hon ored Erotic Goddess HM 20037 directly. We know, for example, from other sources that rituals and blood less offerings were attended by parents on behalf of the young who had not yet been fully accepted into society. The anasyrma ritual, however, needed an in tervening priestess of the Erotic Goddess, much like a sacrifice, in which the sacrificing priest played an intervening role. The figures in versions A and B of the anasyrma type, ranked by age, may provide the answer to the obvious question: why did two female votaries offer variations of the same subject, despite the fact that their encounter in the same ritual space was almost contemporary? HM 20037, with the sexually mature Erotic Goddess, was perhaps a thanksgiving offering by a female votary, after she had reached maturity and after her request had been fulfilled.52 In contrast, the narrative scene of the revealing of the pudenda and the intervention of the priestess on the small plaque HM 20030 indicate a request that was still awaiting fulfillment. If, there fore, the difference in the requests of the votaries is correctly interpreted, the slender body of the double figures symbolizes the youth of the votary, while the doubling of the priestess emphasizes symbolically the girl's request: the gift of arousing erotic desire that was possessed by the Erotic Goddess HM 20037. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE EROTIC GODDESS The analysis of the figure on HM 20020 and 20037 from the Syme sanctuary suggests that she was an erotic goddess. Did she have a specific name by which she would have been recognizable beyond the boundar ies of her cultural environment? Or was she an anon ymous deity? To answer these questions, I use the following method. First I define the social group that requested the protection of the Erotic Goddess and of Hermes, who was worshiped with her, since the ap pearance of two new deities in an age-old cult place was a social demand, and the contemporary dedica tions, in which the individual demands are reflected, help clarify the personalities of the deities worshiped.53 Then, analyzing the pictorial rendering of the Erotic Goddess, I consider whether she was invoked by a specific name or whether she should be regarded as anonymous and assigned to the category of lesser, lo cal deities. Finally, I investigate her role in relation to that of Hermes, the differences between them, and any possible correspondences between the Erotic Goddess and a named goddess of a specific pantheon. I do sug gest a name for the goddess and ask whether the Erotic Goddess of the Syme sanctuary is also to be found at other preclassical Cretan sanctuaries. The Cultic Context Other clay votives from Syme, worked in the round and in relief, attest that the rituals held in honor of the goddess concerned primarily the female sex. Repre sentations of women include the isolated female figure without symbols, nude or dressed, from the Protogeo metric period and later.54 These anonymous female fig ures (figs. 11, 12) are assigned to age groups?young women and adults?on the basis of biological criteria, by analogy with the figures on the two versions of the anasyrma type. The continuing presence of women at the sanctuary throughout the first millennium is also attested epigraphically. In Hellenistic graffiti, the ad jective kola (plural kalai) accompanies female names written on fragments of tiles that came from disused buildings of earlier periods. The use of this adjective to qualify feminine names indicates the youthful age of the dedicators; similarly, the adjective kalos had in Cretan society the meaning of a distinguished and brave youth, who stood out as an eromenos among the paides of the agele (Strabo 10.483.10). In other words, the adjective kala or kalai does not refer to courtesans, nor to sacred prostitutes; rather, it defines the youth ful beauty of a girl of marriageable age or of a newly married bride, as in the rest of Greece.55 Ranking according to age is also the characteristic feature of the men represented on bronze votives, who are depicted as eromenoi and philetores honor ing Hermes with libations, offerings, and sacrifices.56 Like the girls, the youths recorded their presence in the sanctuary during the Hellenistic period, scratch ing their names on fragments of tiles, frequently ac 52Grottanelli 1989-1990,50-4. 53Sourvinou-Inwood 1978,101-3. 54Lebessi 1975a, 327, pi. 257a; 1977,412-13, pi. 217b. 55 Kreilinger 2006, 229,232-33. 56Lebessi 1985b, 112-16,146-62 (Hermes), 188-98 (vota ries); 2002b, 255-64 (Hermes), 269-82 (votaries); 264-67, pi. 12, no. 12 (for the identification of the only bronze female figurine as a goddess and its dedication by a representative of the male sex); contra Budin 2003, 60-1.</page><page sequence="13">2009] THE EROTIC GODDESS OF THE SYME SANCTUARY, CRETE 533 Fig. 11. Plaque of the Middle Dedalic period from Syme (Syme Excavation archive). companied by a place name. Thanks to this custom of adding a toponymic, we know that those who attended the sanctuary came from various cities in eastern and central Crete. The pilgrims of earlier periods also would have been from diverse places, judging by the variety of workshop styles and the votives of different fabrics. The graffiti are very fragmentary, and there are cases of masculine names without a toponymic. It is thus unclear whether the lack of toponymies as sociated with feminine names is fortuitous or reflects a real distinction in the way men and women identi fied themselves. In addition to the names of ordinary mortals, the graffiti also have preserved the names of officials, that of Hermes Kedrites, and also of Aphrodite. The clay figurines of the Hellenistic period also attest the com bination of Hermes and Aphrodite at Syme.57 This is all strong evidence that youths and girls celebrated their maturation in the sanctuary from the early first millennium down to the first century C.E.58 Fig. 12. Plaque of the Middle Dedalic period from Syme (Syme Excavation archive). That the mountain was a site for male activity in ev eryday life or myth did not deter women from attend ing the mountain sanctuary at Syme to participate in rituals.59 Indeed, I argue that the attendance of girls at Syme points to the sanctuary as a locale for the rite of passage when a girl left her father's home to join that of her husband. Protection of this transition from one state to the next was assumed by Hermes, the preeminent god of passages, after the Erotic God dess had endowed the girl?who honored her with the votive HM 20030?with the gift of arousing erotic desire (see fig. 7) .6() The votives and inscriptions leave no doubt that the sanctuary was a center for maturation rites. The rituals, which principally celebrated the attainment of sexual maturity by representatives of both sexes, should not be described by the vague term "initiation," which in cludes all examples of the transition of an individual from a previous to a subsequent state. Rather, the ver dant environment at Syme, with the bubbling water of 57Lebessi 1976b, 7,10-12, figs. 3-5; 1981b, 2-5. 58Lebessi and Stephanakis 2004,186-87. 59 Bile 1992; Buxton 1992, 10-11; contra Marinatos 2003, 143-47. 60 For the role of Hermes in Greece, see Kahn 1979.

The site of the Syme sanctuary, then, and the rituals reflected in the votives come close to the dreamlike description of flowering meadows in lyric poetry that witnessed the sexual maturation of the girls of Lesbos and Lydia, as well as the mixis between immortals or between mor tals and deities.61 The Criteria for Assigning a Name to the Erotic Goddess The arousal of erotic desire illustrated in types HM 20020 and 20037 of the Erotic Goddess is clear and unambiguous (see figs. 3,4,8). The clarity of the mes sage contrasts sharply with the obscure multiplicity of meaning of the theoretical construct established in the 19th century for the "great fertility goddess with many aspects," who fragmented over time into distinct iconographic types.62 At Syme, however, the same message persisted for more than two centuries and reappears there in a Hellenistic terracotta of Aph rodite Louomene (fig. 13). This persistence suggests that the worshipers would have invoked her by some name from at least the Archaic period.63 Her name may be sought in the Greek pantheon, since Hermes, who was worshiped together with her, is one of the Greek gods. Indeed, having assumed the protection of the maturation of young people at the Syme sanctuary as Hermes Kedrites, he was fully identified with the Homeric Hermes in the role of the divine conductor (propompos) of mortals, heroes, or gods, and the god who presided over all difficult transitions.64 In polytheistic systems, the gods meet and happily collaborate in joint projects. This characterizes the collaboration of Hermes and the Erotic Goddess at the Syme sanctuary, who provide divine protection for the youths and girls of Cretan society in their transi tion to adulthood. The contrasting social roles of the two sexes correspond with the contrasting properties of the divine couple, which contributed to the pro motion of the social institution of marriage. It is in the context of this collaboration that the name of the Erotic Goddess HM 20020 and 20037 may be sought. I argue that she is, in fact, Aphrodite. Fig. 13. Terracotta figurine of Aphrodite Louomene from Syme (Syme Excavation archive). Hermes and the Erotic Goddess According to literary evidence, Hermes and Aphro dite collaborate to offer premarital advice during inter course between heterosexual couples.65 A similar idea can be perceived in the iconography of the fifth-century plaques from Epizephyrian Lokroi, on which the two divinities are represented together.66 Moreover, the privilege of dealing with the "charming works of mar riage," bestowed by father Zeus on daughter Aphrodite (Horn. II 5.429), places the primitive erotic omnipo tence of Aphrodite at the service of the legitimate secu lar order that is reflected in the Olympian pantheon.67 The contrasting aspects of the Erotic Goddess and Hermes are illustrated by the votives found at Syme more clearly than in the literary tradition relating to Aphrodite and Hermes. The Erotic Goddess HM 20020, immobilized by her bonds, and the static epiphany of the same goddess on HM 20037 contrast with the constantly moving Hermes, who appears in epiphany in a bronze group of the Middle Geometric 61 Calame 1992, 103-6, 112-17; Krenn 1996, 1-6.

In the last representation, the god is distinguished from his mortal counterparts by the branches of wild olive (?) that spring from his hair.69 According to myth, the Aphrodite of the epic poems is one of the bound deities of the Olympian pantheon, since reference is made to her being trapped along with Ares in a dense net woven by Hephaistos to pun ish their unlawful intercourse (Horn. Od. 8.266-312).70 Moreover, the "old xoanon made of cedar" of Aphro dite Morpho in an ancient temple at Sparta was held "by shackles about the legs" (Paus. 3.10-11,3.15) as an eternal symbol of the conjugal fidelity of girls on the threshold of marriage.71 In contrast to Aphrodite, Hermes is not one of the bound deities of the epic poems; nor did Apollo succeed in binding him, vainly tying osiers around the arms of the young god, since they were loosed as though by magic and hovered above the stolen cows of Hermes' elder brother (Hymn. Horn. Merc. 4.409-14).72 The binding of the statues of the legendary Daedalus and of those of Artemis in Erythrai and Ares in the city of Syedra in Pamphylia by Hermes were means of constraining the image of the deity to remain in the cult location or in the city for the benefit of the worshipers.73 It is perhaps for this reason that Hermes does not intervene to loose the bonds of the Protogeo metric Erotic Goddess HM 20020, since the binding guaranteed her permanent presence in the sanctuary and the protection of the annual maturation rites of the female sex.74 Aphrodite and the Erotic Goddess The ritual practice of binding extended also to fea tures of the place where the bound Erotic Goddess was worshiped. The tree trunk represented on a fragment of a Middle Dedalic cutout bronze plaque is bound with ribbons, on the analogy of the goddess (fig. 17) .75 The ribbons designate the tree as sacred; the bronze archaic votives from the sanctuary, which preserve the Fig. 14.

Hermes on a bronze cutout plaque of the sixth cen tury from Syme (Syme Excavation archive). possesses all the features of a sacred grove, matching the poetic description by Sappho of the Lesbian pre cinct to which she invited Aphrodite to come from Crete.77 The sacred bound trees with the hanging vo tives are grounds for imagining that the xoanon of the bound Erotic Goddess was made of material from the sacred grove, even as the bound statue of the Spartan Aphrodite Morpho was made of cedar wood.78 Nudity is not characteristic of Aphrodite or of the other goddesses in the Homeric epics and the Theogo ny.79 The Syme goddess is also wrapped in an open or closed ritual garment (see figs. 3, 8). Indeed, this gar ment displays literally the erotic power of the goddess, just as the invincible power of Aphrodite to arouse erotic desire in a man is displayed metaphorically in the words of epic poetry.80 Aphrodite's embroidered breastband, her wreath, her gold ornaments, and her other fine garments were aimed at the erotic arousal of gods and heroes alike.81 The garment of the Erot ic Goddess HM 20020 and 20037 is also a means of erotic arousal, for it exposes or reveals the pudenda and breasts and so distinguishes her as a deity from the vast numbers of anonymous nude female figures in both the East and the West. The pictorial difference, then, between the Cretan Erotic Goddess of the seventh century and the well known archaic representations of Aphrodite, in which the goddess is dressed according to contemporary fashion and is distinguished either by the addition of her name or her mythical associations,82 is probably due to extraneous factors: to the means of expression available in different periods and in different regions of Greece. Different local traditions resisted in various ways the gradually emerging pictorial dynamic of the first millennium?which took many decades, down to the mature Archaic period?before it successfully es tablished any widely accepted iconographic types. The epiphany of the Erotic Goddess of the sev enth century at Syme echoes the myth of Aphrodite that describes the goddess as arriving on the verdant slopes of Ida "abounding in water"; standing before Anchises, resembling an unmarried virgin in stature and aspect, she persuaded the hero that Hermes had "facilitated her passage from the meadows of the maid ens to forested Ida."83 The comparison of the goddess with a maiden and the description of the location in the poetic versions of the myth correspond with the maturation rituals and the grove at the Syme sanctu ary. Aphrodite's standing before the hero Anchises matches the behavior of the marriageable maiden, who came to the sanctuary to receive from the patron goddess the gift of erotic arousal so that her impend ing mixis with her companion?the youth, whose com ing of age was under the protection of Hermes?would be blessed. It is not therefore remarkable that the lost background of Aphrodite's role in the development of the young girls and youths of Athenian society can be traced back to the Cretan sanctuary of the Erotic Goddess depicted in HM 20020 and 20037.84 The Name of the Erotic Goddess At Syme, although epigraphic evidence attests the presence of Hermes as early as the sixth century, there is no written testimony for the presence of Aphrodite 77 For a discussion of Sappho fr. 3, see Page 1959,34-44.

Hermes' name is preserved on three fragments of three bronze votives, where it is found together with the verb anetheken and the name of the same tribe and the same kosmos magistrate who oversaw the annual maturation rites.85 The name of Aphrodite is absent in the seventh and sixth centuries probably because she was the recipient of terracotta figurines and plaques, on which, to my knowledge, di vine names are not found before the Classical period. Moreover, the epigraphic evidence from the sanctuary as a whole demonstrates that the custom of writing the names of ordinary mortals and magistrates or of the deities worshiped on fragments of tiles and on vases was not established until the Hellenistic period, while earlier epigraphic testimonia may be counted on the fingers of one hand and are found only on bronze dedi cations. The same phenomenon can be documented at Syme as in other Greek sanctuaries, where early in scriptions with divine names are rare, and when they do appear, from the late eighth/seventh century, they are written on vases used for rituals?a category that, in the first millennium, does not occur at Syme.86 Although there is no written evidence for the name of the Erotic Goddess, this does not mean that she was an anonymous deity of purely local significance.87 It is probable that she was addressed by a specific name, not only because she had a distinct personality but also because the maturation rituals in an interregional sanctuary like Syme presuppose an organization at a level beyond that of individual communities. Respon sibility for the annual repetition of the maturation rituals and care for the sanctuary must have been shouldered by a community official, who would have communicated with his peers, the leaders of the set tlements that participated in the cult, possibly on the lines of the later political grouping of allied poleis who jointly celebrated the maturation of young members of Cretan society at interregional sanctuaries.88 The indi vidualization of the ruling authority of the settlements also formed the social basis for addressing the deity by an individualized name; in the case of the Erotic Goddess of Syme, that name would be Aphrodite.89 The conventional name Proto-Aphrodite is here sug gested for the xoanomorphic HM 20020, first because the representation of the goddess corresponds to the fundamental personality of Aphrodite, and second because this term suggests the development of the Fig. 17. The sacred tree on a bronze cutout plaque of the Mid dle Dedalic period from Syme (Syme Excavation archive). Erotic Goddess to the Aphrodite HM 20037, following a phenomenon observed in all theological systems in which no deity remains static over time. The gradual enrichment of Aphrodite with different capacities is reflected in the wider range of meaning of her epi thets, of which Pandemos and Areia are latent in the remains of her worship in Crete.90 The Cult of Aphrodite in Preclassical Crete The maturation rites of both sexes celebrated at the Syme sanctuary throughout the first millennium im ply the same social role for the Protogeometric Proto Aphrodite HM 20020 as well as for the seventh-century Aphrodite HM 20037. This role corresponds fully to the most prominent aspect of the "Greek Aphrodite," who initiated the mixis of the two sexes and later de veloped a social/political role as Aphrodite Pande mos.91 This does not mean that the Greek Pandemos originated in Crete. It is, however, an example of the contribution made by local cults to the articulation of the features of Aphrodite, which are reflected in the contradictory narratives about the goddess.92 The votives of the seventh and sixth centuries at Syme and Axos have several similarities but also some essential differences that reveal that the Aphrodite of Axos was patron of social groups different from those she protected at Syme.

Conversely, at Syme there are none of the functional weapons deposited at Axos, which demonstrate that the male sex was represented by adult defenders of the polis.93 The female votaries who offered clay votives also would have been adult, since both social groups attended the same local cult place. There is some literary evidence that may well shed light on the nature of the cult activities at the sanc tuary of the Lower City of Axos. As Strabo and other writers report, on the eve of the Battle of Salamis, the city of Corinth charged the women to ask Aphrodite to inspire "love of battle" in their menfolk; on the day after the Greek victory over the Persians, the women returned to the sanctuary of the goddess on the Ac rocorinth with offerings of thanksgiving.94 The col laboration of Aphrodite and Ares is more widespread than her collaboration with Hermes in Crete from the fifth century, while the worship of Aphrodite without a consort is also very widely found.95 The association of Aphrodite with war in the sanctuary at Axos requires detailed documentation, which lies beyond the scope of this study. For the moment, we may note her war like aspect, since it indicates that the inhabitants of Crete in the seventh century recognized Aphrodite as Areia in the sanctuary at Axos and as Pandemos in the sanctuary at Syme. The role played by Aphrodite in maturation ritu als probably developed before her involvement in warfare, since the organization of the inhabitants in settlements preceded the amalgamation of these settlements into poleis. Moreover, the gathering of youths and girls to celebrate their maturation with the objective of marriage is a characteristic feature of pre Homeric societies,96 whereas the assembly of men un der arms to repel the enemy required the institutional framework of the polis. Certainly, Proto-Aphrodite/ Aphrodite served as a cohesive link at both stages of social organization. In the early stage, she linked the small-scale centers of power, inducing the effective mixis of young members of the settlements; and at the more advanced stage, she linked the inhabitants of the polis, inspiring "love of battle" in the body of armed citizens (schol. Pind. 01 13.32b). The absence of the anasyrma type from the iconog raphy of other Cretan sanctuaries does not mean that the cult of Aphrodite was only confined to two cult sites in the first half of the first millennium. Other aspects of her personality may be concealed in hard to-decipher types of early Cretan iconography, which was not subject to typological rules and did not have a standardized repertory. Purely by way of example and with every reservation, we may note two gold finger rings, dated ca. 700-675, which come from a looted tomb of a Knossian cemetery and have a bezel deco rated with two protomes placed between leaves. The combination of the human and floral element calls to mind the epithet Antheia, which is attested only of Aphrodite at Knossos.97 The epithet is consistent with the use of finger-rings as grave offerings, since Aphro dite is linked with flowers or plants used for the dead, while her connection with the underworld is known in some parts of the Greek periphery, where she is referred to as Epitymbia.98 THE GENESIS OF APHRODITE Irrespective of any hypothesis regarding the dissemi nation of the cult of Aphrodite in preclassical Crete, one thing is certain: the xoanomorphic, bound Proto Aphrodite depicted in the Protogeometric figurine HM 20020 at Syme is the earliest archaeological evi dence from a Greek sanctuary for the hazy personality of the pre-Hesiodic and pre-Homeric Aphrodite.99 Its pictorial renewal, which was attempted in the seventh century on plaque HM 20037, with the contribution of the oriental anasyrma motif, belongs within the chron ological horizon of Hesiod's Theogony and is earlier than the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, which reflects the hierarchy of deities established in the epics.100 The early date of HM 20020 raises, once again, the question of the origins of Aphrodite, which has divided scholars into three schools from the 19th century to the present: the western/Indo-European, the Near Eastern-Near Eastern/Cypriot, and the Minoan/My cenaean.101 The archaeological evidence for Proto Aphrodite from the Syme sanctuary is incompatible with the concept of her origins developed by these three theories, which are based mainly on the literary 93Levi 1930-1931, 43-70. At Syme, only votive weapons (Lebessi 1977, 410; 1985b, 266, fig. 2) and large numbers of iron hunting arrows (Lebessi 2000b, 182) have been found.

The social element that participated in the matura tion rituals of both sexes was the driving force behind the creation of the Proto-Aphrodite HM 20020. At the same time, the characteristic features of the god dess?the bonds, the naked breasts, and the motif of the exposure of the pudenda over the dress?have local antecedents in LM III and Mycenaean figurines (see above, under "The Xoanomorphic Type"). In the case of the latter motif, the frequent communica tions between the Mycenaeans and the Near East in LH HIB/C may have played some role in the discreet indication of sexuality exhibited by the Mycenaean figurines.103 Nevertheless, the isolation of the motif above the dress indicates that the western world of the late second and early first millennium was not ready to accept the overt sexuality of the eastern female figure, which beginning ca. 1200 decreases, even among the terracottas of Cyprus. Eastern imports and imported technical expertise do not seem to have influenced the ideology of the western culture of this period in such a way as to provide evidence for the view that deities were imported from the Near East.104 Any iconographic relationship, then, between the Proto-Aphrodite HM 20020 and the Near East will have been indirect in both chronological and local terms. The same is true of the iconographically renewed Aphrodite HM 20037, whose type can be attributed to increased eastern influences that appear in artifacts and poetry from the late eighth century on.105 It may be no coincidence that in the same period, the Hesiodic creation of Aphrodite exhibits some similarity with eastern theogonies, despite the fact that the essential relationship of the episode of the "foam-born" Aphro dite to Hesiod's universe retains its originality.106 The representation of the ritual anasyrma on plaque HM 20030 of the early Late Dedalic period is also an essentially independent creation (see fig. 7). The ritual anasyrma at the Syme sanctuary forms part of a cultic context completely different from that of the women who, as Herodotus relates (2.60), "stand up and pull up their dress" (&amp;vcc&lt;x6povTai &amp;vi&lt;ycdu?vai) at the festival in honor of Bastet in the city of Boubastis in Egypt or of Babo at the Thesmophoria, who, by indecently reveal ing her pudenda, made the grieving Demeter laugh.107 The mature age of the women and the orgiastic, mock ing atmosphere of the Egyptian and Greek festivals are characteristics that contrast with the youthful age of the women on the Cretan plaque and the modesty of the ritual anasyrma behind the altar. Leaving aside the unanswered question of the origins of the ritual, or the possibility that it arose independently in different places, it is clear that the ritual context, which changed from place to place, differentiates the concept of the ritual itself.108 The interpretation of the ritual anasyrma depends on its context and also on the iconographic type of the anasyromenefigure that was used in the same period both for Aphrodite Pandemos and Aphrodite Areia at the Cretan sanctuaries of Syme and Axos, re spectively (see figs. 8, 9) (see above, under "The Cult of Aphrodite in Preclassical Crete"). The unique pictorial characteristics of the Proto Aphrodite HM 20020 and her early date strongly sug gest that she was an independent creation in a period when Dorian features appear in Crete and the inhabit ants of many settlements were reorganized on a new social and ideological basis, incorporating elements of the past that survived in various regions. Cretan society of the Protogeometric period took rather more than a century to accept eastern influences in the artifacts of its most dynamic workshop, the Knossian workshop of the Protogeometric B style (840-810).109 It also re quired two centuries before it could proceed to the iconographic renewal of the Proto-Aphrodite with the eastern anasyrma motif on plaque HM 20037, during the so-called orientalizing revolution.110 Neither the first current of eastern influences, which extended only as far as Crete, nor the second, which spread throughout Greece, exercised any influence on the two basic manifestations of human life apparent in the votives and the continuing existence of sanctuar ies, such as Syme, or in the burial customs and orga nization of cemeteries, such as that of Knossos.111 In any case, it seems unlikely that the local factor in the 10th century would have singled out only the erotic aspect of complex Near Eastern goddesses, such as 102Pironti 2005b, 129 n. 1-3 (with earlier bibliography re lating to the etymology of the name). 103Supra n. 26; see also Cline 1999,121-22, appx. 1-3. 104 For the refutation of the eastern origins of other dei ties, see LIMC3(l):496-97, s.v.

The excavator of the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Amathus on Cyprus notes that "the iconography of the goddess continued to be independent even during the Helle nistic-Roman Imperial period of the sanctuary's exis tence."114 This is the opposite of what happened in the Hellenistic period in the Cretan sanctuaries at Syme and Axos, where the well-known Panhellenic types of Aphrodite (see fig. 13) succeeded the Aphrodite of the anasyrma type.115 The archaeological record at Paphos is also incon sistent with the literary tradition relating to Aphrodite Paphia. The female deity of Paphos, or her earthly representative, was given the form of the Minoan type of the Goddess with Upraised Arms, which appeared throughout Cyprus from 1200 down to the Late Geo metric period. The Near Eastern nude female figure, known as the "Astarte" type, which was prevalent ca. 1450-1200, was not reintroduced to the island until the seventh century.116 It may well be true that the Minoan/Mycenaean residents recognized Astarte/ Aphrodite in the type of the Minoan Goddess with Upraised Arms that was imported from Crete. The conclusion, however, that their descendants in the first millennium imported Aphrodite to Greece found ers on the following questions. How can we account for the transfer of her worship from Cyprus to Crete in the 10th century, when it was necessary to create a new type of erotic goddess, like that of the Proto Aphrodite HM 20020 at Syme, where worship was continuous from the second to the first millennium? And how are we to explain the absence of the type of the Goddess with Upraised Arms from this particular sanctuary and from the well-known Cretan sanctuar ies of the first millennium, despite the fact that her type survived in Crete down to the seventh century? It is clear that, from the early first millennium on, the Minoan goddess ceased to correspond to current reli gious beliefs concerning the presence of a female de ity at cult sites. This is why her gesture, acquiring the significance of an invocation/supplication, passed to the male sex, as is clearly shown by the as yet unpub lished clay figurines of votaries of the 10th, ninth, and eighth centuries from Syme.117 Even if Phoenicians from Palestine or Cyprus came to reside at Knossos, Kommos, and Eleutherna, their arrival was later than that of the Proto-Aphrodite HM 20020, as is evident from the remains that belong to the second half of the ninth century at Knossos and Kommos and in the early seventh at Eleutherna.118 The theory of the Minoan/Mycenaean origins of Aphrodite also can be refuted on the basis of the evi dence from Syme, although it was the very evidence for cultic continuity at the site that led Pugliese Carratelli to revive this theory.119 Both the entry of the female at the beginning of the 10th century into the sanctu ary, which had been male dominated throughout the second millennium, and the independent creation of the Proto-Aphrodite HM 20020 point to mechanisms that leave no margin for assigning the type to the Mi noan/Mycenaean past of the sanctuary. Nor is there proof of the direct descent of Aphrodite from the Indo-European West, since the intermediate stages of her journey to Crete are missing. In contrast to these theories of her origins, the local factor is the motivation for the genesis of the Proto-Aphrodite/Aphrodite at the Cretan sanctuary, as is clear from her unique iconography that incorpo rates elements from the past into the new conception of the divine. Other regions of Greece and Cyprus would have had an equal or lesser dynamic, in which the local cults, with the aid of the local traditions and the available inland, coastal, or overseas channels of communications, shaped the deities that developed in the poleis.120 The polis incorporated among its native 112 Lambert 2004. 113 Contra Bonnet and Pirenne-Delforge 1999. 114Hermary 2000,15-16,82,167-69. 115Rizza 1967-1968, 260, fig. 23, no. 154; Aversa and Mo naco 2006,50 n. 26. 116Karageorghis 1977, 123-28; 2007, 27-62, 236-38. For the late reintroduction of the "Astarte" type, see B?hm 1990, 107-17. 117Budin (2003, 132-54, 171-79, 181-89) argues for the origin of Aphrodite from Cyprus and the spread of her cult to Greece through Crete on the basis of the archaeological evi dence for uninterrupted habitation in the area of Paphos. But archaeological continuity within an area does not mean that the cultural identity and religious ideology of the inhabitants remained constant. 118Stampolidis 1990,103-4; Coldstream and Catling 1996, 406-9; Callaghan et al. 2000, 214, 231, 306-11.

The collaboration of Proto-Aphrodite with Hermes confirms, albeit indirectly, the leading role played by the local factor in the creation of the goddess. A clay figurine of a standing male figure from the sanctuary (fig. 18), contemporary with HM 20020, may well rep resent a god, since the partly preserved gesture can be restored as the Minoan gesture of the dual Hermes in the bronze group of the Middle Geometric period already mentioned (see fig. 14).122 The transfer of the Minoan gesture and stride to the undoubtedly Greek type of the dual Hermes is not surprising, since both customers and craftsmen were familiar with the arti facts of the Minoan past, which are frequently found in cemeteries and sanctuaries in Crete.123 This is not true, however, of the symbolism of the motifs bequeathed by the second to the first millennium, since the devel opment of symbols is subject to mechanisms that are difficult to interpret, even in the case of deities whose names are mentioned in the Linear B tablets. On tablets from Pylos, Thebes, and Knossos, the occurrence of e-ma-a2m does not mean that Hermes Kedrites already existed at Syme in the second mil lennium. The possible connection of the young god of the Olympian pantheon with the term e-ma-a2 will be investigated in a future study based on all the ter racottas and the bronze figurines from the sanctuary, which illustrate the complex mechanisms by which earlier elements are transmitted to later stages of cul tural development; such mechanisms are incompatible with the concept of origins. The silence of the literary tradition concerning the existence of a Cretan-born Aphrodite, on the analogy of Aphrodite Kythereia or Kypris, continues to be a great thorn in the side of scholarship. The irrecon cilability of the archaeological data regarding Proto Aphrodite/Aphrodite with this tradition may be due to the tendency of early poetry to mask people and events with myths that are rich in chronological and local inconsistencies. Poetry, being free to enrich the Fig. 18. Terracotta figurine of the early Protogeometric period from Syme (Syme Excavation archive). idealized image of the deity with exotic elements, may have created over time beliefs in an Aphrodite Kythereia or Kypria, which passed into historical writ ing as fact. The local cults of Aphrodite in Greece that articu lated her personality were forgotten, since they shared the fortune of the communities that gave prominence to her worship; these either went into decline or were absorbed by poleis. The poleis that assimilated the wor ship of Aphrodite promoted her mythical origins for their own reasons, abandoning to oblivion the places that saw the creation of the preeminent erotic goddess of the Greek pantheon, who was known in Greece and to Greek-speakers by the name of Aphrodite. 76 YPSILANTOU STREET 185 32 PIRAEUS GREECE (Lemos 2002, 221-23; Morgan 2003,107-42; Iacovou 2005).
