<plain_text><page sequence="1">Clytemnestra and the Alastor (Aeschylus, Agamemnon 1497ff) Matt Neuburg Just what stance is Clytemnestra trying to take in these lines, when, in her exchange with the chorus after Agamemnon's murder, she says something about an Alastor, an avenging daimon, having paid back Aga memnon? The question is eminently worthy of reconsideration; for it cuts directly to the heart of some of the most influential scholarly discus sions both of the Agamemnon in particular and of the Oresteia in gene ral. Clytemnestra is introducing a divinity in connexion with Agamem non's death; this raises the question of how we are meant to understand the characters of the Oresteia generally as seeing themselves in relation to divine power, and in turn the entire issue of divine and human causa lity and responsibility in the drama, a matter which is central to so much modern Aeschylean criticism. Our concentration upon this passage is really a pretext for taking a new look at some ofthat criticism; the recon sideration of the lines offered here is inseparable from a reconsideration of the themes and issues of the drama as a whole l. 1 A version of this paper was read at the 1984 annual meeting of the American Phi lological Association; I am grateful for close reading, encouragement, and suggestions from Professor W.G. Thalmann, and from Professors J. Henderson and N. Slater. I raise the matter of divine and human in the Oresteia without citing all of the literature, because the matter is so obviously important, and because the literature is so vast; for a good list, see the bibliography cited in A. Lesky, Die tragische Dichtung der Hellenen, G?ttingen 19723, tr. M. Dillon, Greek Tragic Poetry, New Haven 1983, 433-5, and also now that of DJ. Conacher, Aeschylus' Oresteia: A Literary Commentary, Toronto 1987. Elaborate scholarly metaphysical explanations of how we are to understand the wor kings of divine and human causality in the Oresteia are probably thickest, actually, in connexion not with these lines, but around Artemis' anger and Agamemnon's decision to sacrifice his daughter - somewhat perversely, in my opinion, and not least because this moment is not even portrayed directly in the drama; see now the very sensible discussion of Conacher, who calls the anger of Artemis an "alleged problem", than which only the</page><page sequence="2">38 M. Neuburg Most modern readings of the lines in question see Clytemnestra as proposing in the Alastor an alternative agent of Agamemnon's death. In whatever sense, and to whatever extent, and for whatever reason she means to do this, she is thus to be seen as denying that she is Agamem non's (sole) murderer; in modern terms we would say that she is trans ferring at least some of the responsibility for Agamemnon's death away from herself. This is not the only existing view of the lines, but the perva siveness of its presence in the scholarly literature is amply illustrated by its tendency to figure in discussions which seek merely to describe the scene in neutral, universally acceptable terms, and may thus be taken to reflect the communis opinio 2. The purpose of this paper is to make quite clear why this view is ultimately untenable, and to suggest what it might mean for Oresteian criticism to root it out altogether. The discussion will run as follows. First, I will argue that this rea ding makes no sense dramatically - that it cannot plausibly take account of Clytemnestra's motives and concerns, or of the larger flow and tenor of the scene. Second, I will contend that the terms in which this reading is couched make no sense philosophically - that the philosophical (or, guilt of Agamemnon "has caused more critical ink to flow" (76), and characterises the literature on the matter with the comment that "the ingenuity of classical philology lands us, indeed, in some strange dilemmas" (80). In this article I have preferred to attack these strange dilemmas from a different angle, and will concentrate only upon those scenes which seem to me absolutely necessary for an understanding of Clytemnestra's words about the Alastor and the overall conceptual framework of the Oresteia which those words reflect. My opinions on scenes not discussed here, and on the Oresteia generally, opinions which this article unfortunately must often assume without completely expoun ding or defending them, may be found in my doctoral dissertation, An Aeschylean Uni verse, Cornell Univ. 1981; only by ruthless limitation could the challenge be met, of here squeezing my argument into a brief and self-contained format, and I can only ask for sympathy if any loose ends remain. 2 See, for example, O. Taplin, The Stagecraft of Aeschylus, Oxford 1977, 327f. Taplin is concerned with entrances and exits and their dramatic effect, not (primarily) with the problems of the drama's metaphysics and thematic structure. His description of the scene is typical of the way most of us are taught by the scholarly interpretive commu nity to read it: "Clytemnestra starts by glorying in her sole responsibility. But she intro duces the ?aiuxjov Y^vvn? xfjo?e as a source of the deed (1475ff), and then claims she is somehow the manifestation of the aX?oTOQ (1497ff)" (327f). All the key concepts are here: Clytemnestra is calling herself "somehow the manifestation" of a divine force, and this assertion is explained in connexion with the matter of her "responsibility", of who is the "source of the deed" (I use the term "agent" in this article). It is the use of just these terms to describe the scene that this article opposes.</page><page sequence="3">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 39 perhaps, "metaphysical") position entailed by such a view is an illogical position, which cannot meaningfully explain the lines in question. But then, since one might contend (as some have contended) that this philo sophical position, however contrary to our logic, is in fact the logic of the drama, I will thirdly argue that it is inappropriate thematically - that it emphasises an issue which for the Oresteia is in fact not an issue at all3. In support of this last point I will sketch a structural reading of the Oresteia whose unity and power depends upon our seeing the issue here and elsewhere as something quite different from responsibility and divine causality of human affairs, thus suggesting that such matters are inap propriate terms of analysis for the drama as a whole. So much by way of introduction. The scene is this. After Agamem non's death-cry, and the chorus' helpless debate over what to do, Cly temnestra herself appears, displaying the bodies of the slain Agamem non and Cassandra. At first her remarks in iambic trimeters are punctua ted with lyric responses from the chorus; then the structure of the scene changes, and she joins the chorus in a lengthy lyric exchange, the chorus uttering short dochmiac verses, and Clytemnestra replying in anapaests. This lyric part of the scene continues for six such exchanges, until the entrance of Aegisthus; and it is about halfway through it that Clytemne stra utters the lines in question, which read, provisionally accepting Fraenkel's text4. 31 take the issues of the drama here to be those issues with which the characters of the play are themselves concerned; I regard the choruses as characters, and conversely do not believe that there is any character or entity called "Aeschylus" about whom the play can tell us anything. Thus, although the characters of the Oresteia are clearly wor ried about the nature of various deeds performed during and prior to the action of the play, that concern, I shall want to claim, is not about responsibility, and in particular they do not see the involvement of divinity in human affairs as limiting or mitigating human responsibility. 4 Fraenkel (= Aeschylus, Agamemnon, edited with a commentary by Ed. Fraenkel, Oxford 1950) actually obelises the second line, ui]?' ejuXexOfjc; the controversy over these words is addressed below, n. 31.

("You are confident this deed is mine; do not think me to be Agamem non's wife; appearing as the wife of this corpse, the ancient grim Ala stor of Atreus the harsh feaster paid this man back...") Broadly speaking, there are two main ways of seeing Clytemnestra as attributing responsibility for Agamemnon's death to the Alastor in these lines, which we may associate with the names of Daube and of Fraenkel respectively. This opposition is set up by Fraenkel himself. In his comments on the lines, he quotes Daube's now famous dissertation on the problem of Justice in the Agamemnon 5; Daube, as Fraenkel says, "believes that what Clytemnestra says here is meant to exculpate and protect her from punishment", and speaks "of the Sophistic character of the argument'". To Daube, the lines represent a deliberate attempt by Clytemnestra to shift the legal burden of responsibility for Agamem non's death away from herself. With this legalistic orientation Fraenkel himself disagrees; the lines are not argumentative, he says, but emotive-. "The deed now appears to her so frightful that, at least at this moment, she is convinced that only the spirit of vengeance, Alastor, can have done it: he has maliciously borrowed her shape". Clytemnestra is supposed here to come to a kind of horrified realisation that she is not the author of her own act. The difference between Fraenkel's view and Daube's thus rests on whether one sees the adduction of the Alastor's interven logical and lexical study of the term aAxxoxcoQ itself is not useful in determining Clytemne stra's intentions here; Fraenkel's discussion and references remain quite satisfactory. - The translation offered is meant to be provisional, traditional, and unprejudicial; com pare, for example, H. Weir Smyth's rendering (in the Loeb 1926 edn.): "Dost thou affirm this deed is mine? Nay, imagine not that I am Agamemnon's spouse. Taking the semblance of the wife of yon corpse... ". 5 Daube, Zu den Rechtsproblemen in Aischylos Agamemnon, Zurich 1939. From this work this work flow many of the notions now current in the mainstream of Oresteian criticism.</page><page sequence="5">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 41 tion as intended by Clytemnestra to be to her advantage or her disadvan tage; they agree, however, in seeing Clytemnestra as introducing another agent of Agamemnon's death. In the dramatic context this would represent a volte-face on Cly temnestra's part. From the moment of her appearance onstage at 1372 her words, if they are to be interpreted as having anything to do with responsibility and agency, have repeatedly not only admitted but insi sted that she, and she alone, is the agent responsible for the deed. From the start she is clearly proud of the willful and careful premeditation of her deed. At 1377 she stresses the deliberateness of her act, and at 1380, preparing a vivid and gruesomely detailed description of the murder, she declares, "Thus I did, and this I shall not deny". Of course one might argue that at 1497 something has happened which gives Clytemnestra reason to want to alter her stance; but then one must take account of the fact that up to that point she resists that temptation so staunchly. When the chorus evince shock at/the deed and at Clytemnestra's boldness in confessing it, and warn her that she will have to suffer for it, she shows not the slightest inclination to evade the charge; on the contrary, she reasserts her own agency - "here is Agamemnon, a corpse, the work of this right hand", she says at 1404f - and goes on to pronounce herself perfectly prepared (142 Iff) to face the punishment that such agency entails if the chorus can manage to enforce it. Thus both the onus of shame and the threat of force, two strong incentives to the denial of responsibility, have no effect upon her stance. On the contrary, though Clytemnestra may argue with the chorus' condemnation of the d,eed, and may be prepared to resist their sentence by force of arms, she makes it ipso facto quite plain that she is without qualification the right agent for them to judge and sentence. Her responsibility not only goes unquestio ned by anyone on the stage, but is insisted upon as one of the main points of Clytemnestra's understanding of her deed, her pride and self certainty in this regard being key elements of her character; she says, in fact, just the sorts of things that would rule out any later questioning or denial of her agency and responsibility: the deed was premeditated, it was performed freely by her hand, she boasts of it, she is proud of having done it and willing to defend it. Suppose, nevertheless, that later, in the region just before 1497ff, the chorus or Clytemnestra herself raises a point not touched on earlier, one so overwhelming that despite her earlier staunch defence of her deed she now disowns it. Since this point would have to be so overwhel</page><page sequence="6">42 M. Neuburg ming, it ought not to be the kind ofthing Clytemnestra can then just for get about, and so we would expect to see her stance somehow transfor med, and to see that transformation reflected in her lines after 1497ff. But while scholars, reading the play at leisure and concentrating on indi vidual lines, might be able to force such a reading, it is too incredible to suppose that a live audience would find sufficient cues in Clytemnestra's later words and actions to realise that she has changed. Surely it is clear that she is still fully confident and eager to arrogate sole responsibility for the deed at 155 Iff, when the chorus ask who shall bury and mourn for Agamemnon, and she replies: "That's no concern of yours; by our hand he fell, he died, and we shall bury him" - adding, with sarcastic haughtiness, that there shall be no weeping, except that Iphigeneia shall meet and kiss him at the gates of Hades. Here she is still proud of her deed, and her reasons for performing it (which include avenging Iphige neia's sacrifice) contribute to that pride, showing that she regards the act as deliberate and her own. To be sure, at 1567ff she fears the prospect of being herself caught up in the cycle of retributive murder which domina tes the House of Atreus (1574ff): "I am completely satisfied with a small part of wealth if I shall once have removed from these halls the madness of mutual murder (?lavia? ?XX,TiXo(j)ovou?)"; but these very words imply that she thinks of herself as a murderer, as the murderer upon whom such vengeance would rightly be wrought if the cycle cannot be brought to a halt. This she hopes to effect by propitiating the daimon of the house with oaths; she would not feel a need to do this if she saw non responsibility as exculpating her in any significant way. She doesn't want to be the victim of the cycle of murder; but she doesn't back down from her earlier stance, that she was right to kill Agamemnon, even if the dan ger of her own death is the cost6. The scene with Aegisthus follows; the chorus remain unaware of any agent for Agamemnon's death besides Clytemnestra, and in fact clearly feel that she is a far better candidate for such responsibility than the arrogant Aegisthus (1644). This remains the situation as the Agamemnon ends 7; and, if this is not enough, we will 6 That Clytemnestra, throughout the scene with the chorus, cleaves unrepentantly to her contemptuous pride in her deed is, for example, the reading of Page [= Aeschylus, Agamemnon, edd. J.D. Denniston and D. Page, Oxford 1957]; see his notes on 1551 1559 and 1567-76. But on other problems with his view and others like it, see further below. 7 The reading of Clytemnestra's last significant lines, 1654-1661, is far too corrupt for even their general tenor to be usable as evidence for anything.</page><page sequence="7">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 43 find it just the same in the Choephori. Let us look just briefly at the place where we would expect Clytemnestra to be most tempted to deny responsibility, namely her life-and-death confrontation with Orestes: we find that just as in the Agamemnon she threatens the chorus, so in the Choephori she will threaten Orestes {Ch. 912,924), and that just as in the first case she is ready to defend herself bodily so she will be in the second {Ch. 890). That she thinks of herself in the Choephori as being the mur derer of Agamemnon is, indeed, perfectly clear from the tone of Ch. 887 891, and 888 particularly, ?oXoi? oAxyujxe?' co?JteQ ?xxeivafjiev. Of course it is true that Clytemnestra, confronted with a sword-wielding Orestes, appeals to her status as mother in an attempt to win her life; but this is parallel to her desire to propitiate the daimon in the Agamemnon, and indicates no denial of responsibility, but only a desire not to die. Thus not even to save her life does she try to minimise her position as the proper object of vengeance for Agamemnon's death; on the contrary, so far from being even repentant, she is still trying to justify her deed 8. One does not present reasons why one was right to perform a deed for which one believes, or wishes to claim, that one is not responsible. Since Fraenkel's reading of 1497ff is emotive, and thus depends directly on considerations of Clytemnestra's character, the difficulty posed for his view by this evidence is particularly acute; and Fraenkel is aware of this. He hedges his view immediately with the words, "at least 8 P. Groeneboom, Aeschylus' Choephori, Groningen 1949, ad loe, does apparently think that Clytemnestra is trying to claim non-responsibility by an appeal to a sort of fata listic determinism denoted as moira, in the lines in the vicinity of Ch. 910. Now Garvie, too, in the new Oxford commentary (Aeschylus, Choephori, intr. and comm. A.F. Gar vie, Oxford 1986), perpetuates this intepretation, reading the lines as oriented towards the matter of responsibility (296): "We cannot therefore determine with certainty whe ther Clytaemestra means that Moira was alone responsible for Agamemnon's murder ...or that Mo?Qa is mere a participant cause..., the main, or some, responsibility being admittedly her own...."; "Orestes seizes effectively upon the responsibility of MoiQa". But moira is not the name of an interfering divinity, nor of any sort of agency to which responsibility can be ascribed; it is a moral quality of the universe, a conception of pro priety. Cf. N.G.L. Hammond, 'Personal Freedom and its Limitations in the Oresteia', Journ. Hell. Stud. 85,1965,42-55; Hammond shows that moira in Aeschylus refers not to a causal nexus of Destiny but to the propriety of relationships within the order of things. Clytemnestra is simply telling Orestes here that Agamemnon's death was demanded by this order, and he is replying that so is hers; thus all she is doing is trying, in the face of death, to avert that death by justifying her deed. Unfortunately for her, Orestes' deed (as he says in response) is equally justifiable. The scene is further discussed below.</page><page sequence="8">44 M. Neuburg at this moment"; but he knows that even such a momentary variation in Clytemnestra's stance demands further explanation, for in his note on 1501 he gives one: "Clytemnestra has moved far away from her deed, which does not seem to belong to her own self any longer...For the moment she feels herself to be a mere tool of something not herself which has overpowered her". This sort of supplied psychological story, outside of what the words of the text actually tell us, is precisely what is needed, since the turn of events posited, that the proud Clytemnestra is suddenly and temporarily, at her moment of triumph, smitten with a rea lisation that, to her regret or horror, she is not really Agamemnon's mur derer, is unbelievable without one; but just because such a story is (ne cessarily) unsupported by the text it seems arbitrary and unconvincing. The only recourse is to alter the evidence of the text by re-reading at least the lines after 1497ff so that Clytemnestra does appear overwhel med, permanently and not just momentarily, by whatever realisation it was that led to her supposed statement of non-responsibility. This Fraenkel demurs to do 9. 9 Not so E.R. Dodds, 'Morals and Politics in the Oresteia', in his The Ancient Con cept of Progress and Other Essays in Greek Literature and Belief, Oxford 1973,45-63 (ori ginally in Proced. Cambridge Philol. Soc. n.s. 6, 1960, 19-31), who does claim that in this scene Clytemnestra realises to her horror that she has been all along the tool of the Ala stor, and that this realisation breaks her permanently, determining her outlook on the world for the rest of the drama, until she is murdered in her turn. Dodds goes so far in his imaginative redescription of the play as to refer Agamemnon's decision to sacrifice Iphi genia to the involvement of the Alastor, though no character in the play says anything of the sort, Clytemnestra's being the first mention of the Alastor in the play; and he attempts to adduce as evidence for Clytemnestra's new view of her own agency Ch. 691 699, which he attributes to Clytemnestra, even though if this is a speech of Clytemne stra's it is a speech of deception and cannot be used as evidence for her real feelings! And Dodds can do nothing about Ch. 888 (see above), which remains absolutely decisive. Nevertheless Dodds' view is merely a logical extension of Fraenkel's. For a very different sort of explanation that understands Clytemnestra as suddenly and permanently weake ned during this part of the scene, see A. N. Michelini, 'Characters and Character Change in Aeschylus: Klytaimestra and the Furies', Ramus 8, 1979, 153-164. The Fraenkel-type view can also be manifested in various other forms, depending on the other axes a scholar is trying to grind. See, for example, Albin Lesky's Geschichte der Griechischen Literatur, Bern 1963, tr. James Willis and Cornelis de Heer, A History of Greek Literature, London 1966, 259, and especially his Greek Tragic Poetry (above, n.l) 75: "Klytaimestra is forced to the defensive by the horrified chorus,...and slowly begins to realise that her deed is only one link in the chain which binds the House of Atreus". See now also the elaboration of Fraenkel's view by Conacher (above, n. 1): even though (49) "Clytemnestra asserts in the strongest possible terms her responsibility for,</page><page sequence="9">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 45 There is also a battery of arguments against the Fraenkel-type reading connected with genre, which, though they cannot be rendered decisive, are worth glancing at. First of all, we might insist that the very sort of elaborate psychological subtext that must be supplied as part of such a reading is itself alien to the conceptions, techniques, and aims of Aeschylean dramaturgy. Bluntly put, had Aeschylus desired his audience to understand Clytemnestra as surprised by some new realisa tion about the agency of Agamemnon's death, he would, in the nature of his technique, have portrayed this by giving her lines expressing in direct terms surprise or realisation; Aeschylean characters simply do not pos sess a secret inner life, to be brought out by psychological detective work 10. A second point is that sudden crucial character development is probably the last thing we ought to expect from lyric scenes like this one, which tend to be emotionally heightened but situationally static. In all probability the evenness of tone of the recitation was enough to make such change impossible to detect unless the words of the play made it very clear, which they do not. The structure of the moment is in fact just the other way: it is Clytemnestra who is, as she is throughout the Ore steia, the paragon of rock-like stability; she simply reiterates her under standing of her position as murderer, in response to the groping, shock and satisfaction in, the murder of her husband", nevertheless she is led, by 1497ff, "from vehement insistence to vehement denial of her personal responsibility for the murder of Agamemnon" (5 If). Then by the end of the scene Conacher sees the pendulum as having swung back again. Conacher tries to justify thematically these swings in Clytemnestra's stance, but not, in my opinion, successfully. 10 For the classic statement of the linearity of Greek dramaturgy and its effect on what we call character, see R.D. Dawe, 'Inconsistency of Plot and Character in Aeschy lus', Proceed.Camhridge Philol.Soc. n.s. 9, 1963, 21-62; unfortunately Dawe fails to sup ply any substitute explanation for a Greek tragic personage's words at any given moment other than momentary dramatic suspense, a failure for which he is criticised by P.E. Easterling, 'Presentation of Character in Aeschylus', Greece a. Rome 20, 1973,3-19. For a healthy and powerful reading of Greek tragedy in general that avoids, and warns us to avoid, the all too common trap of supplying the characters with elaborate psychological biographies to explain what is in fact the effect of an alien (to us) conception of dramatic "reality", see Jones, On Aristotle and Greek Tragedy, Oxford 1962. What Jones descri bes (33) as "the now settled habit in which we see action issuing from a solitary focus of consciousness - secret, inward, interesting", is, as he demonstrates in Section Two, liable to trick us into reading into the Oresteia concerns on the part of both the dramatist and the people of the drama which are in fact both alien and irrelevant; the idea of the private self is diametrically opposed, indeed, to all that the drama is about. Oresteian scholar ship, even while praising Jones' book, has been singularly slow to accept its lessons.</page><page sequence="10">46 M. Neuburg ed accusations of the chorus, and the focus of the scene is rather upon them, as they come gradually to accept what she is simply saying over and over again. For Clytemnestra to undergo a major reorientation in her understanding of the murder which has just taken place would, moreover, be a major twist in the plot-, but the plot moment of the play, the murder of Agamemnon, is over, and now the play is concerned with intellectual and emotional reaction to that event, and it is the chorus who must be here, as they have been throughout the play, the primary reac tors, as they try to understand what the actors have done n. Daube's reading is open to some of the same objections. Even if we see Clytemnestra as deliberately arguing for non-responsibility, the que stion remains why, given her previous stance, she would suddenly want to do this. But because Daube's view does not depend upon an emotive or ethical basis, it is to some extent immune to this line of attack. For, one can argue, why shouldn't she make such an argument, if it is liable to persuade the chorus? Clytemnestra is defending herself by any and every means, and this argument is such a means. After all, both she and the chorus seem to be trying on various argumentative hats even during the lyric part of the scene: there is talk of Helen, ofadaimon connected with Tantalus, of Atreus, of Iphigeneia, with no clear guiding train of thought; might not non-responsibility be one of Clytemnestra's hats, even if she only wears it for a moment? Viewed in this light, dramatic considerations do not seem quite so telling 12. Now, this argument must 11 This is, after all, a dichotomy fundamental to the nature of tragedy itself, between the actors, who are individuals bound by and struggling with social norms and obliga tions on the level of action, and the chorus who, as representatives of the collective, will be implicated in them; this generates what the late John J. Winkler called the "vector of attention" from chorus towards actors ('The Ephebes' Song: Trag?idia andPolis', Repre sentation 11, 1985,27-62) which gives the chorus in Greek tragedy generally that evalua tive function which we, with our completely different dramatic expectations, frequently ignore or treat lightly - at our peril, if we are to read succesfully in this genre. "My account [of the nature and origin of Greek tragedy]", writes Professor Winkler, " ...ma kes the watchful scrutiny of the chorus structurally important as a still center from which the tragic turbulence is surveyed and evaluated". What I am arguing for in this scene is certainly that structural centrality of the chorus as evaluator, though in this case I would prefer to see it described as dynamic rather than as still. For a large-scale reading of tra gedy in terms that recognise that it is often plot that is static and reaction to it that is dynamic, see Brian Vickers, Towards Greek Tragedy, London 1973. 12 This is why such a "wandering" description of the scene is so frequently a part of the responsibility interpreter's stock-in-trade; cf. Conacher (above, n.9), and Taplin's description (above, n. 2): "Clytemnestra and the chorus are somehow getting at the truth</page><page sequence="11">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 47 be made in one of two forms - because either Clytemnestra believes the argument she is making here to be valid, or else she does not. In the lat ter case she is claiming that the Alastor's agency absolves her from responsibility; in the former case she believes it. But either way Clytem nestra must have some ideas about this question; she must be concerned with the matter of divine agency and its implication for human responsi bility. She is, in short, a metaphysical philosopher. Seen this way, the view can be attacked on two grounds: first, that if Clytemnestra is a metaphysical philosopher, she is a bad one; and second, that in any case she isn't one. If Clytemnestra's adduction of the Alastor is intended to refer to the matter of responsibility and agency, and if it is to do her any good as a defence against the chorus' accusations, she must intend to represent her own responsibility and agency as in some sense problematic: she must thus be enough of a metaphysician to believe it possible to disarm the chorus' accusations by questioning something so arcane and techni cal as the causality and agency of her deed. If, on the one hand, she belie ves in her own argument, then her metaphysical awareness must very strangely come and go; for if her agency is as problematic as this, she is not entitled to her earlier pride and talk of her "just right hand", nor liable to the vengeance, divine and human, which she later feels threa tens her. If, on the other hand, her claim that her agency is problematic is merely rhetorical, or is meant only to serve the needs of the moment, then the scene portrays her wasting her breath - for the chorus are not convinced by her claims. Either way, Clytemnestra as a philosopher is an inconsistent and ineffectual philosopher. The chorus, her intended audience, are no better: they fail to pick up on the inconsistency in her of the matter, and are searching for a way out of the tangle". To some extent this "wande ring" is itself dramatically suspect, of course. Try to make dramatic sense of the outline of the scene by R. P. Winnington-Ingram, Studies in Aeschylus, Cambridge 1983, Chapter 6, 'Clytemnestra and the vote of Athena' (essentially unchanged from his original article in Journ. Hell Stud. 88, 1949, 130-147): "Clytemnestra, who had exultantly claimed full responsibility (1402), now changes her ground, with the mention of the Daimon. She sees herself... not as the wife of Agamemnon, but as the embodiment of an ancestral curse (1497ff). The instrument of the curse indeed she is, but personal responsibility Aeschy lus will not allow her to disclaim... " ( 112 : my italics, and notice the key words " (personal) responsibility", "embodiment", "instrument"). And how does Winnington-Ingram explain the rest of the scene? Clytemnestra "returns" to the theme of Iphigeneia at 1555, she "reverts" to the Daimon at 1567, and in trying to strike a bargain with it she evinces "a change of mood indeed".

Thus if Cly temnestra is claiming strong non-responsibility here, and if the chorus are aware of this, everybody in the scene is momentarily adopting a r?le of philosopher which none of them has the intellectual acuity to main tain. But this is a crazy vision of the scene. Why would Aeschylus want to portray Clytemnestra as inconsistently employing a philosophical argu ment as a means of persuading a chorus who are incapable of understan ding it 13? One cannot get out of this difficulty by regarding Clytemnestra's claims of non-responsibility as weak - for example, by saying that the Alastor's alleged agency is meant to be viewed as compatible with her own. Granted, compatibilism is a tenable philosophical stance (the modern analogue is deterministic compatibilism); but a compatibilist argument would not do Clytemnestra any good, since if Aeschylus (or 13 For Clytemnestra as strongly claiming non-responsibility, cf. H. Hommel, 'Schi cksal und Verantwortung: Aischylos' Agamemnon 1562\ in his Wege zu Aischylos II, Darmstadt 1974, 232-263. Hommel views the whole scene as representing an unresol vable deadlock on the responsibility question. A similar view of the movement of the scene, I think, though one steering very clear of the Necessity and Free Will issues that Hommel stresses (and certainly free from any attempt to offer in connexion with the scene an interpretation of the entire drama), is that of Arthur W.H. Adkins, Merit and Responsibility: A Study in Greek Values, Oxford 1960, Chapter 6, 'External Interferen ce'. Professor Adkins thinks that there is in this part of the scene an argument between the Chorus and Clytemnestra as to whether Clytemnestra can disclaim responsibility for the murder on the grounds of the Alastor's intervention (so the issue of responsibility is, in his view, definitely raised); but he also feels that Aeschylus makes it clear, by the end of the scene, that she cannot. L. Versenyi, Man's Measure: A Study of the Greek Image of Man from Homer to Sophocles, Albany 1974, 162-207, in fact opines that all the main characters of the Oresteia hide at one point or another behind divinity. Cf. also Th. G. Rosenmeyer, The Art of Aeschylus, Berkeley 1982, especially 240 and 298.1 find Profes sor Rosenmeyer's view confusing and hard to pin down; perhaps it is unfair to try to cate gorise or quote him out of context, but he seems to adopt a Hommel-type view that both Clytemnestra and the chorus are bandying about various attributions of responsibility during the scene, while at the same time subscribing in the large to a Fraenkel-type reading of Clytemnestra's character. Professor Rosenmeyer is aware, more keenly than many others of the responsibility school, that this reading makes the scene wander about in a dramatically odd way (cf. above, n. 12); but he waves off the dramatic difficulties of Clytemnestra's sudden shirking of responsibility with references to the "fluidity" of Aeschylean characters' explanation of their deeds, saying that Clytemnestra's adduction of the Alastor merely answers her psychological needs of the moment. But this seems just an ad hoc way of skirting the difficulty (for it surely does not mean to imply a theory of Aeschylean characterisation as so inconsistent that characters are just saying everywhere inconsequentially whatever they like).</page><page sequence="13">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 49 Clytemnestra) is a compatibilist, then divine causality and human responsibility cannot, ex hypothesi, be at issue, and the lines in question, if Clytemnestra is in fact asserting divine agency in the deed, would say nothing (and there would be no reason to utter them). Compatibilism is not a stance that would allow Clytemnestra to talk of herself as the "em bodiment" or the "instrument" of some divine force; this is just the way a compatibilist would not talk, since the essence of compatibilism is that such embodiment or instrumentality, though true, adds nothing to the understanding of one's individual action. Thus to introduce the Alastor would not be to say anything new about Clytemnestra, there being no non-trivial distinction (as far as agency is concerned) between Clytemne stra's saying that she did the deed and her saying that the Alastor did it. It is incoherent to make Clytemnestra a compatibilist on the one hand while simultaneously seeing her as trying to mitigate her own agency on the other. Yet this is just the sort of incoherency introduced by those who on the one hand adhere to the responsibility school without on the other hand being willing to go as far as Daube and to dismiss Clytemnestra's argument as mere sophistry. Consider, for instance, the muddled state ments of Page. "Clytemnestra is not saying (what would be patently false) that it was not her hand which did the deed, but only that the Ala stor worked through her; there was only one person engaged - the Ala stor embodied in Clytemnestra" (208). Page can scarcely get through this sentence without contradicting himself. If "the Alastor embodied in Clytemnestra" is the correct characterisation of Agamemnon's murde rer, and yet does not detract from Clytemnestra's agency or the delibe rate r?le of her hand in the deed, what useful difference is left between Clytemnestra and the Alastor? How does this sort of adduction of the Alastor help Clytemnestra to show, as Page claims it does, "that her kil ling of Agamemnon is not an act of individual impulse"? Page makes nonsense of Clytemnestra's position, losing it in a wash of important and loaded philosophical terms, unphilosophically and carelessly used 14. 14 Of course, Page represents Clytemnestra as saying something philosophically interesting (if mysterious); but her argument as he adumbrates it is more on the level of Ignatz Mouse's beautifully disarmed twaddle in G. Herriman's Krazy Kat comic strip of October 9, 1927 (P. McDonnell et al, The Comic Art of George Herriman, New York 1986, 78): "- IGNATZ: T'was truly I who did it, Officer Pupp, tut it was the me in me that willed it. -OFFICER PUPP: And it's the you in you that I should arrest, is it? - IGNATZ: Sure, it's the me in me that's to blame. So it's the me in me that you should</page><page sequence="14">50 M. Neuburg Similarly, when Lesky calls the union of freedom and necessity in Aeschylus " unanalysable ", he is merely glorifying the failure of his view to make any sense when elevated to the level of a doctrine and issue in the drama 15. Nor does it help to regard this philosophical incoherency as a feature, not of Clytemnestra's argument, but of Aeschylus' thought; indeed, it makes things worse. If the philosophical weakness is in Aeschylus himself, why would he want to broach (and indeed, presuma bly, render thematically central) a philosophical issue that he isn't equip ped to handle? It does the play no service for us to regard Aeschylus as a metaphysician if the only way to do so is to see him as a confused meta physician. The philosophical positions which these scholars, and others of the responsibility school, must attribute to Clytemnestra or Aeschylus are themselves extremely shoddy examples of philosophy, and so end up not only not illuminating the drama nor making it more satisfying or comprehensible as tragedy, but actually dragging it down to the level of the inane. The responsibility interpreters would have done better to study and straighten out the philosophical issues for themselves before foisting their own confusion onto Aeschylus. This comes, I think, of trying to see as an issue in the Oresteia a mat ter of responsibility about which the play is simply not concerned. Human responsibility in the face of divine interference in events is sim ply not the sort of thing the Oresteia and its characters are worried about. It is only something that we worry about; that is, the relationship between the human and the divine in the Oresteia seems so curious and troublesome to us that we see the characters of the play as likewise curious about and troubled by it. But though the text most assuredly operates within certain assumptions about the moral and divine regula tion of the human world, assumptions which, as they are very different from our own, it is our task to isolate, explicate, and define, this does not arrest. -OFFICER PUPP: All right, I'm arresting the you in you. - IGNATZ: But you're also arresting me! - OFFICER PUPP: Well, if you can get away from the you in you, you are a free mouse". 15 For Albin Lesky's view of metaphysical necessity imposed by the gods and human freedom of the will as unanalysably united in Aeschylus, see his 'Decision and Responsibility in the Tragedy of Aeschylus', Journ. Hell Stud. 86, 1966, 78-85. Cf. also A. Rivier, 'Remarques sur le 'n?cessaire' et la 'n?cessit?' chez Aeschyle', Rev. et. gr. 81, 1968, 5-39; J. Fontenrose, 'Gods and Men in the Oresteia', Trans. Am.

Gaiser ed., Das Altertum und jedes neue Gute, Stuttgart 1970, 65-77. The list could be greatly expanded.</page><page sequence="15">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 51 mean that the play is about these matters, which to the Greeks, or more strictly to the characters of the drama, may simply be the common back ground of action and discourse 16. Under the responsibility interpreta tion, on the other hand, the posited argument between Clytemnestra and the chorus over responsibility for the murder of Agamemnon is ele vated in status until it becomes somehow the point of the drama. So vio lently strong a light is shone upon the lines in question that the dramatic and even philosophical unlikelihood of the interpretation is cast comple tely into the shade; the play is made out to be really about the strange r?le of the gods in human lives and actions - and not about the mundane and boring matters of the clashing views of familial and civic rights and obligations and r?les which all the characters appear to be talking about throughout the play 17. The responsibility interpretation is thus doomed 16 Compare, as an example of a solid piece of scholarship which detects the under lying attitudes of our Greek literary remains while remaining cognizant of the fact that these attitudes may not be conscious or mutually coherent, the very sensible orientation and approach of K.J. Dover, Greek Popular Morality in the Time of Plato and Aristotle, Berkeley 1974. 17 That such matters as the troubled articulation of social r?les were serious enough to be the subject of tragedy, and were indeed its proper subject, is fortunately now increasingly being recognised. See Winkler (above n. 11) and Jones (above, n. 10); also S.C. Humphreys, Anthropology and the Greeks, London 1978, Chapter 8, Part II, 'Kin ship in Greek society, c. 800-300 B.C. Many attempts have indeed already been made by great scholars to argue that the metaphysical school of Aeschylean interpretation puts emphasis on a question of personal responsibility and freedom which is alien to Greek concerns, or that it misapprehends the concerns and orientation of the genre of tragedy itself, or that it makes Aeschylus out to be "primitive" or illogical to the point of unbelie vable mindlessness; nevertheless the metaphysical approach continues to be influential, if not downright dominant - hence this paper. Examples of such salutary correctives are Vickers (above, n. 11); H.D.F. Kitto, Poesis: Structure and Thought, Berkeley 1966, 33 115; and K.J. Dover, 'Some Neglected Aspects of Agamemnon's Dilemma', Journ. Hell. Stud. 93, 1973, 58-69. What I am suggesting here is that the failure to understand that such issues of articulation of and conflict between social r?les are the stuff and subject of Greek tragedy has led scholars to dislike the Oresteia we actually have, and so to write a new one, a kind of Oresteia of the mind - the modern mind. For this prejudice against the "literal" Oresteia, see for example R. Kuhns, The House, the City, and the Judge, Indiana polis 1962: "In short, the Oresteia is a drama of heavenly justice and human justice ..." (10); "When the specific events of the trilogy are thus placed in the larger framework of cosmic evolution the plot of the Oresteia in its literal manifestation may appear to dimi nish in dramatic intensity, for the violent murders and invocations, the pursuit of Orestes by the Erinyes, the threats of the gods and the fearfulness of men become part of a larger design... Yet to find the significance of the 'duller' passages is precisely the way to an understanding of the trilogy as a whole. If we see the work as a drama of murder and</page><page sequence="16">52 M. Neuburg to failure philosophically in part because it is applied anachronistically. The Greeks certainly held a number of beliefs (or, to put it better, had a variety of feelings) about the r?le of the gods in human events, which might not taken as a whole stand up well to rigorous philosophical elen chus; but these must be studied as background attitudes, as part of the Greek ground of being, rather than being elevated to the status of pro blems of which Aeschylus (or Clytemnestra) is supposed to be con scious. And when we do study the matter this way we get a very different sort of result: the researches of Dover, for example, suggest that in the Greek cultural context (in which the words of our text would be under stood by its audience) an explicit claim of divine interference would likely work against the plaintiff18! Let us now return to the text itself. The fact is that the words of the text, when closely considered, simply will not support a view that Cly temnestra does say anything about the nature of her individual involve ment with the deed - that she is, for example, the "embodiment" or the "instrument" of the Alastor; and we may see this even without being entirely certain of our reading. Clearly her words are a denial of some thing; and, just as clearly, they contain an opposition - in particular, they oppose the notion of Clytemnestra as Agamemnon's wife to that of the Alastor as the murderer. But then Clytemnestra has made the wrong opposition for the responsibility interpreters! She ought to say, if her lines are to raise any divine causality worth making compatible or incom patible with her own agency, that she is Agamemnon's wife, and yet the Alastor is the murderer. In fact, however, Clytemnestra's lines deny, not that she is the murderer, but that she is Agamemnon's wife. The lines, in other words, contain something about her relationship to Agamemnon; she adduces a divinity of vengeance, not to mitigate her personal invol vement or responsibility, not to deny that she is (or was when she did the revenge it becomes melodramatic..." (15). This is really an elaborate and periphrastic way of admitting that Kuhns' interpretation first disregards and then has to explain and bring forcibly into line what ought to be the primary "given" of any interpretation, namely, the literal and obvious facts and concerns of the drama. Yet Kuhns is merely enunciating explicitly the implicit prejudices of the responsibility interpreters. 18 Greek Popular Morality (above, n. 16), especially 133-160. Dover not only shows that it is we who are caught up in intricate questions of responsibility, and gives some good explanations for why this is, but demonstrates that the Greeks, lacking a view of the individual as separate from his social existence, looked at responsibility from a ruthlessly functional standpoint, from which a claim of divine intervention would most likely be taken as adding to one's blameworthiness, not mitigating it.</page><page sequence="17">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 53 deed) the very Clytemnestra who a moment ago was so proud of the murder, but in the service of quite a different question - whether or not she is the wife of the dead man. Now, this is not a change of position on her part; she has not been claiming all along that she is Agamemnon's wife, after all, only that she is his murderer. It is this issue that we must face in grappling with the lines: why would Clytemnestra wish to claim that she is not Agamemnon's wife? and on what grounds can she make such a claim 19? To answer this question, we need to know something about how family relationships are crucial to the drama as a whole; we also need some sense of why characters in the drama do invoke divinity, if not as a way of mitigating their own responsibility. If it can be shown that the question of how to label Clytemnestra is of itself crucial to the larger context of the drama, as well as to Clytemnestra's and the chorus' pur poses here, and that divinity is adduced in the drama in the service of debates over such labelling (rather than as a means of calling responsibi lity into question), then this part of their exchange will have been sati sfactorily explained. Since we cannot hope for a complete interpretation of the Oresteia within the limits of this article, we shall do this by selec ting one character who functions as a particularly telling focus of such labelling problems, and who similarly adduces divinity at critical instants - namely Orestes - and then by insisting upon (what the drama itself insists upon) the rigorous parallelism between Orestes elsewhere and Clytemnestra here. The Oresteia centres upon three deaths, Iphigeneia's, Agamem non's, and Clytemnestra's, and the problematic nature of the linkage 19 Not that the responsibility scholars are unaware of this problem; but they find ways of behaving as if it did not exist. Fraenkel recognises it, but cannot offer a solution. "The worst difficulty", he writes (710), "is that I cannot even discover a train of thought into which the words 'Ayafxenvov?av e?va? n' ako%ov will fit and give a satisfactory sense. What we expect is 'that Agamemnon's wife has done it'" (i.e., as opposed to 'that I am Agamemnon's wife'). Yet this is the critical problem; how can Fraenkel propose a reading of the rest of the speech without facing it? Daube himself weasels out of the diffi culty by insisting that, though Clytemnestra is trying to deny her own responsibility, she is doing it badly: "Es verbinden sich hier zwei Vorstellungen, die von der Sinnest?u schung des Chores und die von der Identifizierung mit einer g?ttlichen Kraft. Indem dies bewu?t geschieht, wird der sophistische Charakter des Argumentes offenkundig" (190). This is just a way of blaming on Clytemnestra the difficulties his own argument faces when we actually look at the text. Page tries to solve the problem by emending 1498; but the offending words are not these, but 1499, which remain.</page><page sequence="18">54 M. Neuburg between them. On the one hand these three deaths are connected in series: the killer each time is the victim the next. But at the same time they are connected in a curious kind of parallel. Under the conception of ??XT] which prevails for most of the trilogy, the deaths are all justifiable, indeed required, insofar as they obey the dictates of vengeance. Aga memnon sacrifices Iphigeneia in order to effect vengeance upon Troy for violation of the rules of guest-friendship; Clytemnestra kills Aga memnon in response to his sacrifice of Iphigeneia20, and Orestes kills Clytemnestra in response to the murder of Agamemnon. Thus the paral lel: the murders are all double in nature, legitimate and necessary when seen as vengeance, but at the same time horrible and reprehensible because they involve family members killing one another. Now this doubleness of the nature of each murder has a curious consequence. Because of the way the deaths are linked in series, each can be justified as vengeance only by condemning the previous death as hei nous family murder and ignoring its aspect of legitimacy. It is, for exam ple, the view that Agamemnon was wrong to kill Iphigeneia, which makes it right for Clytemnestra to kill Agamemnon. Yet this, because the deaths are also linked in parallel, is a paradox; for if Agamemnon was wrong to kill Iphigeneia, just because this was family-murder then Cly temnestra is equally wrong to kill Agamemnon, because this family-mur der too. In justifying Clytemnestra's deed, one also by implication con demns it - a moral paradox. It is with Orestes that the problematic nature of this situation is brought to a head. From his first appearance in Choephori right through the trial in Eumenides, the fundamental difficulty confronting him is that he cannot avenge his father, a just and necessary act, without also mur dering his mother, which makes him a family-murderer, and puts him on 20 A great deal has been written, actually, on why Clytemnestra does kill Agamem non; but certainly Ag. 1412ff, 143 Iff, 1523ff make it clear enough that she regards her deed as the just response to the sacrifice of Iphigeneia. That Agamemnon's death is justi fiable also as a response to the crime of Atreus, and that it is explicitly stated by Cassan dra (?x xcov?e, 1223), Aegisthus (?x xcov?e, 1603), and by Clytemnestra herself (1500ff, the lines with which this paper deals) to be such a response, in no way negates this fact. Aeschylus is not concerned with motives and reason, but with actions and responding actions, with a conception of justice as act (not feeling) of vengeance. In any case, there fore, nothing in this paper depends upon Clytemnestra's having any specific reason for killing Agamemnon, only upon her having certain very definite types o? justification for having killed him.</page><page sequence="19">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 55 an exact par with Clytemnestra, so that in killing her he does the very thing he is killing her for doing. To help him get out of this bind, Orestes very frequently adduces divinity, in the form of Apollo; and this reminds us of Clytemnestra's adduction of the Alastor. But Apollo, we shall now show, is never adduced with a view to mitigating Orestes' responsibility, about which he is as vehement as Clytemnestra, and which is never que stioned anywhere in the drama. Let us examine Orestes' vehement assertions of his own responsibi lity for Clytemnestra's death. They include Ch. 988-989 and 1027, and Eu. 463,588, and 611 - and note that we are certainly meant to be remin ded, especially by these last three, of Clytemnestra's Ag. 1380; Aeschylus is at pains, by this echoing, to emphasise the parallelism of Orestes' and Clytemnestra's respective positions. What is especially noteworthy about these admissions is that they are all accompanied by a qualifica tion; and this qualification is that the deed for which Orestes bears responsibility is also just - and on the particular grounds that Clytemne stra was the murderer of Orestes' father, so that the deed is characterisa ble as legitimate vengeance21. Furthermore, at Ch. 1030, Eu. 465, and Eu. 594, Orestes also adduces the involvement of Apollo, and now we can see why: it is in support of his claim, about which he is otherwise uncertain, that he has acted justly. Orestes has performed a deed which, he must grant, can be condemned as mother-murder. It is not enough for him to point out every time that there is another side to the deed; the two aspects are equally valid, unless he can show some other reason for emphasising one over the other. This is what Apollo is for. Apollo, being a god, and one who knows x? \ir\ ??txeiv {Eu. 86), can be relied on to know for a fact what Orestes does not claim to know without his sup port, namely, that murdering one's mother is just, in the case where this also constitutes avenging one's father 22. Indeed, Orestes' doubt about 21 Thus Ch. 988 is accompanied by ?v?txoo?, and is followed (99 Iff) by description and condemnation of Clytemnestra's treachery against Agamemnon; Ch. 1027 has oiw aveu ??xtj?, and is immediately followed by a condemnation of Clytemnestra as jraxQoxx?vov; Eu. 463 is followed by ?vxixxovoi? jioivatoi Jiaxo?c, and an appeal at 468 to the question of whether the act was done ?ixaioo?; Eu. 588 leads to 602, where Clytemnestra is avoooxxovouoa, and to 61 If, where the ?ixai ? question is raised again. 22 Certainly it is perfectly clear that this is what the appeals to Apollo are for in the Eumenides, when the issue of whether Orestes' act can be just is precisely what Apollo is called in at the trial to argue: "Apollo", says Orestes at Eu. 609ff, as he retires before the Furies' cross-questioning, "explain for me whether I killed her with justice; I did it, it's true, I don't deny it, but whether justly or not, in your own opinion, you must decide".</page><page sequence="20">56 M. Neuburg the justice of his deed, and his reliance upon Apollo for the encourage ment to choose to see it as father-vengeance rather than mother-murder, is a leitmotif ?iou$io\it. That Apollo did so encourage him is plain from the terms in which Orestes recites Apollo's oracular exhortations at Ch. 273? ("if I fail to pursue my father's killers and kill them in return"); and Apollo confirms this construction in his first confrontation with the Furies at Eu. 202f: "Did you oracle the stranger to kill his mother}" "I oracled him to send vengeance to his father". Moreover, up to the actual moment of the deed Orestes is unusually careful to talk of avenging his father, making as little mention as possible of his mother, and never once using the word "mother"; he manages even to get through his questio ning of the chorus as to why Clytemnestra sent the libations to Agamem non's tomb, and to interpret her dream, without mentioning her name or status 23. The critical moment for Orestes is,&lt;of course, when he is finally face to face with his mother, he holding a sword and she the breast which she says suckled him; the double nature of his deed is now manifest, and he enunciates his dilemma, breaking the taboo at last: "I shame to kill my mother" {Ch. 899). It is at this critical instant, when the unresolvable doubleness of the deed threatens to involve Orestes in an inextricable aporia, that Pylades breaks silence to speak - of Apollo. This, a reminder of the word of a higher and more knowledgeable authority, is sufficient to admonish and encourage Orestes, and he is now able to select one view of his deed and stick to it, which he does resolutely throughout the ensuing stichomythia with Clytemnestra, he insisting upon seeing Cly temnestra as nothing but the necessary and legitimate object of ven geance for Agamemnon's death, even while Clytemnestra does every thing she can to get him to see her as his own mother, whom it would be wrong to kill. He dissociates her from any sort of relationship of 4&gt;iXia with himself or his father, because she, by murdering Agamemnon, has lost all claim to such categorisation (906f). When she says she nourished 23 Particularly clever is his circumlocution at Ch. 543, "If the snake left the same place as myself...", which allows him to avoid speaking of birth in respect to himself and Clytemnestra. This avoidance of the use of the word "mother" is noticed also by Lebeck (above, n. 4), 110-130; see also D.H. Roberts, Apollo and his Oracle in the Oresteia, G?t tingen 1984,5If, and now Conacher (above, n. 1), passim. As Conacher points out (e.g., p. 105), Electra and the chorus are involved in this avoidance as well, though to a lesser extent. It is important to emphasise, however, that I disagree with Conacher's (and others') assertions that the adduction of Apollo is meant to excuse Orestes' deed on the basis of some sort of divine compulsion.</page><page sequence="21">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 57 him, insisting on her motherhood, he terms her the slayer of his father (908f). In this way, too, must be understood the immediately succeeding lines about jioiqcx: Agamemnon's death, she says, should be blaimed on jxoiqcx - not "Fate", but "propriety" : given Agamemnon's acts, he had to die; Orestes replies that given hers so must she. When Clytemnestra reminds him explicitly that he will be killing his mother (922) he says that she will be killing herself - not that he will put the sword into her hands to spare himself the blood-guilt, but that she, by killing Agamem non, which calls for the response of vengeance, has already put the sword to her own throat. When she warns him of her Furies, he counters with those of his father (924f). And so on; but the claims are equal in and of themselves; only Pylades' reminder of Apollo's backing for the father vengeance point of view enables Orestes to carry through, as he subse quently says himself {Ch. 1030ff)24. 24 On U.O?QCI, see above, n. 8. - Conacher (above, n. 1) well describes the scene (123): "Almost every line...echoes this precise reciprocity... In a sense, Orestes 'wins' each of these exchanges, but the repeated element of lex talionis in his prosecution reminds us that requital in these terms calls for like requital... Orestes, however justified himself, now becomes as vulnerable as Clytemnestra was". But it must not be supposed that Apollo's oracle contained or implied any more than this. Much has been made of Ch. 1031, where.Orestes says that Apollo told him that if he did the deed he would be ?xx?? caxia? xaxfj?; it was this assurance, Orestes says, that encouraged him to kill Clytemnestra. If you already believe that the play raises issues of freedom and responsibility, you can convince yourself that this means 'not responsi ble'. But in fact the words just mean 'beyond reproach', 'not blameworthy'. Apollo told Orestes that the deed was not wrong, not that he could act outside of the normal canons of agency and responsibility; this is all that Orestes claims at Eu. 609ff, and it would be anomalous if he were to claim more here. Compare the phrase exco aixiav at Eu. 99 (and compare the usual prose sense, e.g. at Thucydides 6, 14 and 6, 46), 'censure attaches to me', not 'I am held responsible'. See also J.P. Vernant, 'Ebauches de la volont? dans la trag?die grecque', in J.P. Vernant and P. Vidal-Naquet, Mythe et trag?die en Gr?ce ancienne, Paris 1973, 43-74. There is no need to suppose, as does for example Roberts (above, n. 23), Chapter 2 passim, esp. 39 and 47, that these lines reveal for the first time a " second part" of the oracle, which Orestes has had like an ace up his sleeve all this while; the most natural reading is to see them as simply another way of saying what Orestes has attributed to Apollo all along. One must also not make the mistake of adducing as evi dence for something that Apollo told Orestes the words of Athene, Eu. 798f, aux?? 0' ? XQT|oa? aux?? f|v ?

Neuburg Orestes thus uses Apollo's involvement and divine status never to diminish his own responsibility, but to help break the moral deadlock between the opposing natures of his deed-, and observe that the problem for Orestes is one of his own status, his identity - father-avenger or mo ther-murderer? -just as Cassandra laid it out for us back at Ag. 1281 (or, as the chorus put it at the end of the Choephori, "deliverer or doom?"). The matter of his responsibility is never at issue25. Particularly telling in this regard is the way the arguments are conducted at the trial in the Eumeni des. Orestes' commission of the murder of Clytemnestra, and his liability for punishment if that murder is shown to be wrong, are never challen ged; the question facing Orestes, and argued for him by Apollo before the jury, is rather whether, in the face of the parallels between his deed and Clytemnestra's, a disjuncture can be created, a sort of wedge driven between the two. And since this cannot be done by reference solely to the nature of their respective deeds - for, as we have seen, if Orestes' deed is justified simply as vengeance, so may be Clytemnestra's, and if Clytemnestra's deed is condemned as family-murder, so may be Orestes' - it must be done by over-valuing one sort of family-relationship (the fa ther-son relationship) at the expense of another (the mother-son relation ship), so as to make Orestes out to be a father-avenger and not a mother murderer. And this, we observe, is precisely a matter of labelling in terms of family relationships26. Thus (and this what we set out to back at least to Verrall, and sometimes involves trying to interpret the phrase ?xx?? ai Tia? xaxf]? as a prediction by Apollo that Orestes would not be harmed, an impossible bending of the Greek). 25 It is true that Orestes' position is unpleasant and complex; but his having been told by Apollo to avenge Agamemnon, with a description of the consequences if he fails to do so, in no way is supposed to make us question his metaphysical freedom, or eligibi lity for agenthood, any more than the epiphany of Hamlet's father's ghost alters the metaphysical status of Hamlet. Indeed, much of the difficulty for Hamlet, as for Orestes, is that he will be the responsible agent if he ever gets around to performing the murder. The comparison with Hamlet is not one of apples with oranges; the similarity of the con cerns of both dramas, and the growth of similar dramatic patterning in the Greek and the Germanic (including English) crystallisations of the story, is quite astonishing. It is still worth reading Gilbert Murray's wonderful essay, 'Hamlet and Orestes', which is Chap ter 8 in his The Classical Tradition in Poetry, Harvard 1927. What is so striking is that this can be so despite the polar difference between Shakespeare's concern with inward irre solution and Aeschylus' with outward pulls of conflicting norms and status. 26 The need to find this wedge is already foreshadowed by the Choephori chorus before Orestes' deed, at Ch. 829; the text is hopelessly corrupt, but surely a contrast is being drawn between Clytemnestra claiming Orestes' obligations as her x?xvov and</page><page sequence="23">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 59 demonstrate) it is absolutely essential to the drama to drive home the parallelism between Clytemnestra's deed and Orestes', so that it will be just this parallelism that will give Orestes so much trouble and create the need for this wedge. For this reason, what we have learned in our analy sis of Orestes' position is evidence as to how the play wants us to under stand Clytemnestra's position; and we are now ready to re-read the scene between Clytemnestra and the chorus in the light of our under standing of the drama's dominant thematic concerns. The whole opening section of the scene between Clytemnestra and the chorus, before the lyric portion begins, is devoted to establishing the two opposing views of Clytemnestra's deed. When she appears onstage after the murder of Agamemnon, she does not deny her deed, but she is at some pains to voice her conviction that it was right. Her first speech ends with her saying that the deed was done justly (1396). In the second she calls her slaying right hand "a just workman" (1406). When the cho rus warn her that she must be exiled, she takes them to task, in her third speech, for not saying the same of Agamemnon the child-murderer - all she has done is to perform the sort of vengeance they should have perfor med (1419). In her fourth speech she swears by the Justice of her dead child, elaborating the meaning of this Justice by reterming it Ate and Erinys, retribution and vengeance, the rubrics under which her deed is just (143 Iff)27. She invites the chorus, not without some sarcasm, to Orestes' insistence that he is primarily the JtaxQ?? x?xvov (cf. Conacher [above, n. 1], p. 122). When the Furies face Apollo for the first time in the Eumenides we begin to see what form the wedge will take, as the Furies, trying to defend Clytemnestra's deed while condemning Orestes', insist that husband-murder is not really family-murder at all, because the wife is not ouxxiuo? with the husband {Eu. 212), and they stick to this line of argument during the trial {Eu. 605). By this time (658ff) Apollo is ready with an opposing argument along the same lines, that the child is related by blood only with the father, not the mother (indeed, Conacher suggests [p. 175, n. 4] that the nature of Apollo's argu ment is anticipated as early as Eu. 84). I believe that the point of the biological wedge, and of the tie vote and Athena's legally irrelevant grounds for favouring Orestes (736ff : she is a biological freak, having a father but no mother), is that in fact no legally germane difference between the two deeds can be found, so that the trial is decided arbitrarily on sexual grounds instead. This ties into the way the whole drama, culminating in the crisis of the trial, divides the universe into male and female forces. See further F.I.

Neuburg judge of the rectitude of her deed, which she has already decided in her own mind is right (1394, 1401-1403, 1412, 1420f)28. The chorus, on the other hand, the first time they are able to get two lines in, devote them to reminding her that this is her husband over whom she boasts. Clytemne stra sees herself as having acted justly under the rubric of avenger for family-murder, while the chorus see her only as someone who has slain her own husband, which is obviously reprehensible. At 1448 there is an important dividing line in the structure and mood of the scene. Clytemnestra has spoken; her position is clear. The scene now belongs to the chorus, who are in so many ways the main cha racter of the Agamemnon, as they begin to come to terms with their grief and shock, -and with what Clytemnestra is telling them about the nature of her deed. Thus the chorus' lines become now mournful and sear ching, as they try to understand (not the agency but) the nature of Aga memnon's death - if God is just, why had Agamemnon to die? - while Clytemnestra responds each time, now in anapaests, commenting on the chorus' developing song29. The chorus first try (1455-1461) to under stand Agamemnon's death in terms of Helen; it was, perhaps, as they feared in the First Stasimon, and indeed throughout the first half of the play, the error of undertaking the war at all which has resulted in this calamity. This Clytemnestra rejects (1462-1467). They then think of the daimon of the House of Atreus; it is not for some public wrong, but in connexion with the chain of vengeance within the family, that Agamem non has died (1468-1474). Clytemnestra responds encouragingly (1475 1480): the notion of recurring vengeance certainly ought to weigh hea vily in the chorus' understanding of Agamemnon's death 30. The chorus, 28 Notice especially the language of 1403f: the chorus are offered their choice aivEiv or ip?yetv. This, in connexion with the preceding announcement, kqo? ei?oxa? X?yo), turns out to be the ritual language of praise- and blame-poetry; see G. Nagy, The Best of the Achaeans, Baltimore 1979, Chapter 12, 'Poetry of Praise, Poetry of Blame', 222-272. Clytemnestra casts the chorus as judging poets; they then (starting at 1448) sing her blame, and she comments on the song as it develops, trying (not to exculpate herself, but) to correct the song so that it sings aright. 29 For a clear statement of the chorus' theological dilemma over the possible status of Agamemnon through the course of the play, see W.C. Scott, 'The Confused Chorus {Agamemnon 975-1034)', Phoenix 23, 1969, 336-346. This dilemma is not about divine and human responsibility either; it too is moral. The chorus know that the gods want the bad punished, and that they support and demand legitimate vengeance; what they are having trouble with is the divine morality behind Agamemnon's death. 30 Those who see in Clytemnestra's upcoming lines a reference to the question of her responsibility tend to see the daimon here too as some sort of genuine causal agent</page><page sequence="25">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 61 having seen this, are all the more distressed; for it means that Agamem non's death can be seen as a result of the very lex talionis morality which is upheld, on their own earlier account, by Zeus and Aixr). And so, when the chorus once more (1489-1496) groan over Clytemnestra's wifely treachery, she answers, as we can now plainly see, naturally and straightforwardly - by telling them not to think of Agamemnon's death as a wife's murder of her husband, but as an act of vengeance. And she does this by saying that she should be labelled wot as Agamemnon's wife, but as an embodiment of the concept of vengeance. This, in context and in consonance with the tone and concerns of this part of the play and of the trilogy as a whole, is the purport of 1497ff. The chorus condemn Cly temnestra's treachery. "You are confident the deed is mine", she replies, introduced by the chorus. But this reifies the daimon unnecessarily. The chorus know who killed Agamemnon; they would have no reason to introduce a new agent. What they don't understand is what his death means-, what they are probing for is a moral perspec tive on that death. Their expression of these perspectives must not be read in the light of post-Newtonian (or even post-Stoic) causality. No one, for instance, thinks that Helen in the previous stanza is mentioned by the chorus because they think she is a direct causal agent of Agamemnon's death in any sense; obviously the chorus are giving expression to a feeling, &amp; feeling about the patterns and vicissitudes of life - Agamemnon's death may make moral sense as a terrible culmination to the whole bloody affair of the Trojan war. Fraenkel (for example) is quite silent on the question of the motivation and intent of the chorus' "outburst against Helen"; presumably he feels it is natural and not metaphysi cally problematic. But then why should anything different be said of the lines about the daimon (or, for that matter, the Alastor)? All the chorus mean to do here is exclaim that there has been a great deal of repetitive murder in this House, and now here is one more wretched instance. Clytemnestra underlines that aspect of this feeling which serves her own purpose of justifying the deed as vengeance: she says, in effect, "You appeal righdy to the idea of the daimon within the family (yewnc xtjo?e), the tendency that this idea represents (?x xov eqoo?) for blood to beget blood - for all I did was to respond to family bloodshed with more family bloodshed, something for which I have ample precedent". For a similar methodological criticism, on a slightly different issue in the drama, see Leon Golden, 'Zeus, Whoever He Is...', Trans. Am. Philol Ass. 92, 1961, 156-167; Golden compares Page's and Lloyd-Jones' vision of a cruel and anthropomorphic Aeschylean Zeus with a reading of the Battle Hymn of the Republic as literally about an anthropomor phic god stomping grapes and waving a sword. For the way in which events are referred to other events in the Oresteia as source but not (in the modern sense) cause, see M. Gagarin, Aeschylean Drama, Berkeley 1976,64: "There may be more than a merely tem poral relation between one crime and the next... But to understand this language, which is metaphoric and linguistic, as indicating a logical cause and effect is to misunderstand not just the Oresteia but poetry in general".

Neuburg applauding the chorus' abandonment of their earlier attempts to under stand Agamemnon's death as emanating somehow from Helen. "Don't even take into account the fact that I am Agamemnon's wife" (a label which makes her out nothing but a vile husband-murderer)31; "it is the Alastor in woman's shape who [not murdered, but] paid him back" 32. Clytemnestra wants to be thought of not as wife but as avenger, as the spirit of vengeance itself; only so can she be seen as paying Agamemnon no more than is due the slayer of Iphigeneia, the son of Atreus who made the child-banquet. The deed needed doing; that she, who happens to be Agamemnon's wife, is the one who did it, is (she contends) neither here nor there33. 31 This reading of the lines thus permits us to keep the manuscript wording at 1498, (XT]?' ?juXexOfi?. Fraenkel expounds clearly the difficulty with these words: [XT]?? with out a preceding negative cannot mean 'but not', and so can be retained only as a non connective, 'not even', which he feels puts an inappropriate stress on the verb which fol lows; and as for the verb itself, ?mXexOfi?, the passive form is not a problem, according to Fraenkel, but the meaning is, and he proceeds to cite examples from Herodotus pro ving emXeyoum unequivocally to mean 'take into account'. It is on these grounds that Page emends. But Fraenkel's problems are now our solutions; the lines do mean, and, we now see, make important and powerful sense to mean, just what Fraenkel fears they have to mean. 32 Fraenkel and Page, and indeed LSJ, insist that one must translate the active cut? xeioev along the lines of "used him as payment", on the grounds that only the middle can mean 'pay back' in the sense of 'punish'. This may be right, and does not seem to me to hamper my larger argument. But Greek was a living language, not a set of fixed and inflexible theoretical rules; and even when there was a distinction between the mid dle and the active meaning of a verb, the active could be used in the middle sense, where the context made the meaning obvious and especially in poetry. The ambiguity of mea ning is a feature of the verb itself; the active or middle can be called upon to make clearer one possibility or the other where this is consonant with the larger flavour which choice of active or middle voice gives to verbs generally, but it is the sense required by the con text, not the voice distinction, that actually determines the sense one will hear. Nume rous examples of active where we might have expected middle are quoted from Sopho cles by A. C. Moorhouse, The Syntax of Sophocles, Leiden 1982, 177; notice especially ctji?va) used at Philoctetes 602 to mean 'requite'. I see how one can pay back money, or a debt, where the direct object denotes the medium, or the character, of the payment; but the idea of using a person as payment seems so unnatural and strange that I cannot help feeling that the Greek ear would hear these words as if the middle had been used. (It also seems to me that even on Fraenkel's showing the active would in any case mean, not 'used him as payment' but 'paid for him', i.e. for his acts. Cf. Iliad 17,34 xioei? yvcox?v eu?v, obviously to be translated as Lattimore does, "pay the penalty for my brother", as well as Ch. 435 if we accept xetoei?). 33 Again, the fact that Clytemnestra here expresses the legitimacy of this vengeance in terms not of Agamemnon's sacrifice of Iphigeneia but of Thyestes' feast is not to be</page><page sequence="27">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 63 The chorus are rattled by this compelling way of looking at the murder. Clytemnestra may not be entirely right - the deed is still heinous - but, they are forced to grant, " an ancestral Alastor might have a hand in it". This phrase is not a literal description of the mechanism of Agamem non's death, any more than was Clytemnestra's adduction of the Alastor in the first place. If the lines are so taken, as they must be on the respon sibility interpretation, they are flabby and anticlimactic: here we would have Clytemnestra claiming to be totally uninvolved, on the grounds that a divine force has suddenly metamorphosised into human form and stabbed Agamemnon to death, and now the chorus would be saying, "Well, that isn't very likely, is it? but certainly this divine force could have assisted you somehow" - following which they slide, in the next breath (1511), into an attribution of the deed not to the Alastor but to Ares! Further, if this were really an argument about the precise degree and nature of the involvement of a literal divinity, and if Clytemnestra really means to disavow responsibility, and if the chorus hear her as doing this and mean to reject her claim, why doesn't she insist upon it once more in her next line ( 152 Iff) ? The claim, after all, would be crucial - the whole issue of her guilt or innocence would turn upon it - and yet here we would have the chorus flatly denying it, and Clytemnestra paying no attention! Clearly responsibility was never at issue at all. What the chorus are granting here is that vengeance is a possible (though not the only) reading of the deed. The double nature of Clytemnestra's deed is being forced ineluctably upon them; the murder is both just and unjust, and neither aspect can defeat the other34. It is to this unresolvable doubleness that the chorus give climactic expression in their last lines of the scene, 1560-66 - really the climactic seen as a difficulty for this reading. On the contrary, Clytemnestra's position is made more powerful by this stance; though her deed was personally motivated by Iphigeneia's death, her deed is more forcefully justified in the larger framework of vengeance for Thyestes (a second family-murder for which Clytemnestra is the avenger). There is no need to appeal to a concept of "over-determination", as does Hammond (above, n. 8), which has misleading implications of causality. 34 With my view of this part of the scene compare H. Neitzel, 'OEPEI 4&gt;EPONT' - Ein Aischyleisches Orakel (Ag. 1562)', Hermes 107, 1979, 133-146; Neitzel argues very fully, using Hommel (see above, n. 13) as a straw man, for the entire scene as a clash between the two views of Agamemnon as victim (so the Chorus) and as killer merely kil led in return (so Clytemnestra). He does not, however, bring his reading of the Alastor lines into conformity with this structure (and I'm not sure that he has provided in the end a satisfactory explanation for the words cJ&gt;?Q?L &lt;|)?QOVxa either).</page><page sequence="28">64 M. Neuburg and key lines of the entire play. All through the Agamemnon the chorus have tried to justify in their own minds Agamemnon's war on Troy, despite its hideous consequences for the citizenry and the reprehensible slaughter of Iphigeneia that ushered it in, by insisting upon its aspect of legitimate vengeance. Now this argument has boomeranged: Clytemne stra has beaten them at their own game. She has slaughtered Agamem non, and has then appealed for justification to the very argument to which they resorted to bolster their hopes for Agamemnon's ultimate safety - that vengeance is the way of Zeus, the way of the universe. To the extent that they call her family-murderer, she can do the same to Aga memnon; conversely, to the extent that Agamemnon's murder of Iphi geneia is justifiable as serving the larger demands of vengeance upon Troy, so is Clytemnestra's murder of Agamemnon justifiable as serving the larger demands of vengeance upon him. The doubleness of Aga memnon's moral position, and hence the moral doubleness of Clytem nestra's murder of him, is inescapable. At the same time, the Chorus are also brought at last to the further realisation that this is a problem inhe rent the notion that Justice is Vengeance: as long as this is the rule, the chain of mutual killing can stretch on for ever (which, of course, is what very nearly happens in the succeeding parts of the trilogy). Thus when Clytemnestra at 1497ff calls herself Avenging Angel, not Wife, she is giving expression to the doubleness of her own status as slayer of Aga memnon, and not letting the chorus over-simplify by seeing her as just a husband-killer; by this insistence, and by the chorus' eventual stalemate, the stage is set for this same doubleness to devolve upon Orestes, for his acquittal by a jury whose tie vote reflects the very same quandary, and for that redefinition of justice, as community-based trial rather than clan-based vengeance, without which, as the chorus of the Agamemnon bring us to see, there can be no end to killing.</page><page sequence="29">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 65 Excursus on the AITIOS -words Many readers will probably consider the most serious piece of evi dence against the entire forgoing argument to be the chorus' use of the word ?vaixio? at 1505, in their reply to the lines of Clytemnestra with which this paper deals. As soon as she is done with her Alastor speech, the chorus deny emphatically that she is ?vaixio?. Those who have come to see in her words a denial of responsibility will see here a denial of the denial; as Page puts it ad loc, "the Chorus refuse to accept wholly the plea...that Clytemnestra is the instrument of divine justice". The argument against me runs: the chorus are denying Clytemnestra's non responsibility; therefore, if their reply is to follow logically, she must have just asserted it; therefore my view of her lines is wrong. What we have here is a clash of philological methodologies. If we assume that we know that ?vaixio? means 'non-responsible' then of course the word poses me a very serious problem indeed. But my claim is that this is precisely what we do not know. We don't understand Greek, we don't intuit Greek concepts; we have to try to grasp the "meaning" of Greek words from their literary usage, because this is all we have. Now, I have just argued that in this text the notion of "responsibility" is a modern red herring - that (if we make no assumptions about ?vaixio? at all) everything about both the immediate context and the dynamics and structure of the drama militates against its presence in this scene, that the scene is better read without it. From this I feel entitled to suggest that ?vaixio? does not mean 'non-resiponsible' here. Moreover, those who think that the meaning of ?vaixio? is known are basing that "knowledge" on this and other passages into which the notion of responsibility has been read. What my work is meant to suggest is exact ly that at least some such passages should be rethought. This article is a rethinking of this one: it has confined itself to discussion of a single locus-, it cannot be expected to pit itself against an entire philological tra dition which has gone searching for instances of the notion of "responsi bility" in classical literature, and has, naturally enough, found it - and has centred it in the adjective a?xio?. Those who regard my argument with any sympathy will see it as implying the need for a re-examination of this tradition, and will, I hope, undertake it; those who regard the tra dition as immutable will see this single word as vitiating my entire argu ment. Perhaps, however, it is incumbent on me to defend my interpreta tion a little further. The diachronic process of semantic development of</page><page sequence="30">66 M. Neuburg the term a?xio?, as with any semantic development, depends upon the extraction of a new "meaning" for the term based on contexts to which it is habitually restricted. To see what this means, take, for example, the English word "silly", Old English {ge)saelig. Before Old English times it meant 'happy'; by the 13th c, this incuded also the Christian case of being 'happy' because one was 'blessed' by God. But since God was regarded as blessing and protecting especially the weak and downtrod den, the word was used to describe also those whom we would call 'in nocent', 'helpless', 'deserving of pity', 'poor, feeble'. Now, up to this point (around the 14th c.) "silly" may still be said to "mean" 'happy, blessed'; its use in the context of describing someone pitiful or weak is simply a special case. But by this time it is also becoming restricted to these cases, as "blissful", "joyful", "happy" take over its uses to mean 'happy', 'blessed'. At this point, phrases in the language such as "silly sheep", "poor silly man", "silly stuff" become exemplary of the "mea ning" of "silly": it now "means" 'poor, feeble, feeble-minded'35. For the adjective a?xio? we are talking about similar stages of evo lution. At first the word simply means 'at fault': it characterises someone as the object of censure (on the grounds of having committed some act which society or an individual regards as wrong). Consider the well known instance Iliad 1,153, where Achilles says, "I didn't come here to fight Trojans, ejrei oi3 xi |ioi ai'xioi eioiv" - that is, "I have no fault to find with them" 36, "I'm not mad at them". Achilles is describing his social and moral feelings about the Trojans: they've done nothing to him (such as stealing his cows or ravaging Phthia), so he has nothing against them. When someone is mad at you for supposedly having done some thing, however, one way to avert his anger is to divert it to someone else. Thus if I say to you that I shouldn't be a?xio? to you because person X should be (as at Od. 2,87), I am certainly raising the issue of responsibi lity, in the sense of "who did it"; but that doesn't mean that the word a?xo? itself "means" 'responsible'; it still ?means? only 'to be censured'. It focusses on society's or an individual's attitude of fault-finding towards someone, not on one's status as agent relative to a deed 37. The question is whether by Aeschylus' time its use in such contexts had cau 35 Details from M.L. Samuels, Linguistic Evolution, Cambridge 1972, 67. 36 So e.g. G. Autenrieth, A Homeric Dictionary, tr. Robert P. Keep, rev. I. Flagg, Norman 1958, s.v. a?xio?. 37 Cf. Lattimore's translation of Od. 2,87, "you have no cause to blame the Achaian suitors, but it is your own dear mother". English translation can of course muddy rather</page><page sequence="31">Clytemnestra and the Alastor 67 sed it to be apprehended as /?^/""meaning" 'responsible' (i.e., 'the one who did it, as opposed to others who might have done it'). The use of the a?xio?-words in the Oresteia does not suggest any such thing. The language certainly seems to have reached a stage where these words can mark involvement in an act, without any overtone of censure whatever - thus Agamemnon's way of thanking the gods for his safe return to Argos, in his first words at Ag. 810ff; is to call them ejxoi jxexaix?ouc v?oxou, who have helped me to return home' - but they do this in a transitional, non-technical way, and the issue is still moral, not metaphysical38. Agamemnon here isn't concerned with the metaphysi cal question of agency; he just wants to be pious, by thanking the gods for whatever he has been able to accomplish, and to justify his actions, by reminding his hearers that he has had the backing of the gods, whence that of divine morality. Again, when Electra asks the chorus to be [xexaixiai in her ?oi^f| as to how to pray at Agamemnon's tomb {Ch. 100), she isn't asking them to share in the responsibility for what she does, as if it were a crime for which she may want to avoid punishment later. She doesn't mean, "Take some responsibility for this decision"; such a translation creates an entirely false emphasis. She is merely asking for their help and advice (as Ch. 105 makes clear). Thus the a?xio? words in and of themselves are still not markers used to pick out what we would call "the responsible agent". This means that in instances where "responsible" does look to us like an attractive translation we should beware of heedlessly loading them with such extra metaphysical baggage. There may be a temptation to toss about the notion of responsibility in translating Eu. 199f, where the chorus tell Apollo that he is not just jxexaixio? but Jtavaixio?; but we mustn't mistake the Furies' intent. They aren't talking about who is responsible for Orestes' murder of Clytemnestra. If they were insisting that Apollo held sole responsibility for that murder, it would hardly than clarify the issue, because our phrase "x is to blame" has, like a?/cio?, moved from meaning 'x is someone worthy of finding fault with' to 'x is the one to whom the deed should be attributed'. - 38 To show in detail and not with reference only to the Oresteia that the a?xio? words have to do with the morally evaluative notions of praise and blame, and not the technical concept of responsibility, would require a separate study (and one, in my opi nion, which is badly needed); but see H. R. Immerwahr, 'Aspects of Historical Causation in Herodotus', Trans. Am. Philol. Ass. 87,1956,241-280, who shows that for Herodotus, at least, despite Powell's lexicon, "amn is used only in a human (ethical) context, and nearly always where blame attaches to an action" (244).</page><page sequence="32">68 M. Neuburg make sense for them to pursue Orestes for it. xovxiov, the objective genitive with these a?xio?-words, refers (as the context makes clear) not to the murder, but to the fact that the Furies are occupying Apollo's san ctuary. Apollo has just upbraided them for this; they reply by exculpa ting themselves. What they mean is, "Well, that's your own fault; you're the one who told Orestes to kill his mother [202] and then let him in here [204], and so, since it's our job to pursue mother-murderers, here we are". The Furies aren't engaged in metaphysical argumentation; they're insisting that the behaviour for which Apollo censures them is in fact right, and if he doesn't like it he has only himself to be angry at. One final example, the only other instance of ?vaixio? in Aeschy lus. The Choephori chorus of slave-women say at 873, as the cry of the smitten Aegisthus is heard, "Let's stand aside, so to seem xcov?' ava? xiai xax v". Obviously this doesn't mean 'non-responsible' - the responsibility of a chorus of women for a bloody and violent murder commited openly by Orestes was never likely to be raised, regardless of where they stood physically. The question is one of how their propriety of behaviour during the current and upcoming violence might later be regarded. They want to avoid censure, not responsibility. All of this is meant to suggest that one cannot, without circularity, use the a?xio?-words as evidence for a concern with responsibility which the Oresteia does not otherwise manifest. After Clytemnestra justifies her deed by calling it legitimate vengeance, the horrified chorus naturally still refuse to withdraw the censure of her to which they have been giving voice since they learned of the murder (indeed, as we have seen, they will never entirely withdraw it). This they express (1505-7) by denying that she is ?vaixio? - "How could anyone possibly attest that you are not to be censured for this murder?!". That claim, inherent in her exhortation that they cease to take into account the fact that she is a wife killing a husband, they reject. But the double nature of the deed is now appallingly evident to them, and they make it evident to us, as they must if we are to understand the drama properly. They thus proceed to grant that Clytemnestra's r?le as avenger, under which rubric her deed is just, is also real; it does make sense to speak of the involvement of the family Alastor here (1507f). Neither has the issue of responsibility been raised, nor do the chorus speak to it; what they mean by their reply is, that though this be husband-murder, and therefore worthy of censure, yet (paradoxically) there is vengeance, whence justice, in it.
