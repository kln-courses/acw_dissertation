The plan included a discussion of his friendship at Rome with John Flaxman, during the years 1792-94 when their respective European tours overlapped. This extended to the inclusion of drawings from Flaxman's sketchbooks at Yale and the V&amp;A, and text from his Florentine journal at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. However, as this work progressed, it occurred to me, both as editor/author of this material, but above all in my parallel role as general Editor of the Walpole Society, that there was a danger of spoiling the pitch for any Flaxman scholar in the future, if I allowed myself, for comparative pur- poses, to quote too liberally from the Flaxman journals and sketchbooks. Accordingly I resolved to find Flaxman specialists who might be persuaded to join forces, so that together we might instead transcribe and reproduce all these documents in their entirety, together with others such as the journals in the British Library and at University College, London. I am enormously grateful to David Irwin for his initial encouragement; to David Bindman for his supportive help and above all for introducing me to Alison E. Wright, of the British Museum, and Eckart Marchand who at that time was at the University of Reading, and is now attached to the Warburg Institute Archive, both of whom very generously agreed to participate. Thus we arrived at a collaborative volume in which Flaxman now takes centre stage, with a full analysis of his most important Italian sketchbooks and journals, preceded by three essays that explore different aspects of Flaxman's reception of antique and Italian painting and sculpture. The Flaxman material is followed by a critical catalogue of all the known drawings made after Italian masters by William Young Ottley and his associates, of which the three principal repositories are the Ottley portfolio in the John Appleby collection in Jersey; the archives of Séroux d'Agincourt at the Vatican; and the collection of Humbert de Superville at the Accademia, Venice. The unity of this study of taste and artistic purpose is reflected in the compilation of a single Bibliography and Index, both of which apply to the entire volume. Each editor/ author will express personal and academic acknowledgements in the notes to the relevant section. Here, however, we would like to express a joint debt to David Bindman. In the same spirit I thank David Brown and Andrew Wilton for reviewing the entire Ottley portfolio, and for their many helpful suggestions as this project developed. The Walpole Society joins with the authors/ editors in thanking the various institutions which have gone out of their way to supply us with photographs, especially Julius Bryant and the print room staff at the Word and Image Department of the V&amp;A Museum; Duncan Robinson and Andrew Morris of the Fitzwilliam Museum; Timothy Wilson and Jon Whiteley of the Ashmolean Museum; Emma Chambers, Nina Perlman and Andrea Fredericksen, of the Strang Print Room, as well as the staff of the Special Collections Library, all at University College London; Anthony Griffiths, Kim Sloan and Hugo Chapman of the Dept of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum; Thorsten Opper, Curator Greek and Roman Sculpture, British Museum. We also acknowledge the generous cooperation of the Courtauld Institute, the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, and the Yale Center for British Art in supplying us with photos, made before its export, of the Flaxman sketchbook at Yale. Alan Stone of Hill-Stone Inc., New York, i</page><page sequence="10">PREFACE generously provided photographs of a hitherto unrecorded portfolio of over ninety Otdey draw- ings, many original inventions made by the artist in Italy, a few of which are reproduced here, that only came to light just as this volume was going to press in June 2009. The Yale Center for British Art then rose to the occasion in photographing, at the very last minute, drawings by W. Y. Otdey, bound into a Piroli/ Ottley volume of aquatints, which suddenly became relevant, following the discovery of the Hill-Stone portfolio. Without all this institutional and personal help the present volume would not have been viable. We further acknowledge extremely generous financial support from John Appleby which enabled us to commission digital photography of his Otdey portfolio, and to meet the enormous cost of buying photographs and securing reproduction rights from the Vatican. The Paul Mellon Centre, London, and The Henry Moore Foundation both provided generous publication grants towards the costs of this volume. H.B.

For here, at the top of a manuscript now preserved at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (inv. no. 832.5), he lists, presumably for further study and investigation, works by two fifteenth-century Florentine painters whose names scarcely register in the published travel literature of that time: Botticelli's Madonna del Magnificat, only acquired by the Uffizi two years earlier, which he attributed to Taddeo Gaddi, and an Adoration of the Magi, probably to be identified as the Domenico Ghirlandaio altarpiece at the Ospedale degli Innocenti. Of course, Flaxman's remarkably focused working journal recording his impressions of classical, medieval and Renaissance works of art at Florence, together with the preceding journal covering his travel from Brighton to Bologna (BL Add. MS 39786), and a further journal recording his journey from Rome to Naples (UCL), was never intended as a conventional Grand Tour narrative to be exchanged among friends and relatives. For this we must turn to his wife Nancy's journal (BL Add. MS 39787) that covers, with essential domestic details, the entire journey from their departure from London in the autumn of 1787, across France and north Italy to Florence, where they stopped for a month from 1 to 28 November 1787; Rome where they stayed from 1 December until 9 January 1788; and Naples where they stayed for two further months before finally settling down again at Rome on 2 April 1788. Studied together, these overlapping accounts enable us to chart with some accuracy the artistic interests and touristic diversions of the Flaxmans in Italy. It imme- diately becomes clear that Flaxman was extremely well prepared to study both antique and Italian art, had read the travel literature from Jonathan Richardson onwards, and probably had in his luggage Martyn, Northall and maybe Cochin, as well as the second edition of Lalande to which specifically he refers. Moreover, it is readily apparent that he was equally familiar with the scholarly literature, Vasari, Pliny, Caylus and Winckelmann, to cite only the most obvious, and certainly set out with some strong artistic principles around which to define his taste. Nancy Flaxman tells us much about the conditions of travel across Europe, with detailed accounts of the inns, their landlords and servants, the food and drink, the clothes and general appearance of the local population, with occasional asides on the status and role of women. Although conscientiously she describes the sights at Rouen, Paris, Versailles, Sèvres and St. Denis, she leaves us in no doubt that the aim was to reach Italy as quickly as possible, wryly observing at Lyon: 'It contains but few things interesting to an Artist especially who is on his way to the Mistress of the World'.1 She goes on to give a vivid and amusing account of crossing the Alps at Mont Cenis, so tighdy wedged with a travelling companion into a sedan chair that 'I verily believe if they had toss'd us over the mountain they would have found us in the same seat'.2 She describes being carried through the villages on the Italian side, 'receiving the bows of the inhabitants as though we had been Eastern Princesses convey'd in litters on the backs of elephants'.3 3</page><page sequence="12">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE Turning now to Flaxman's first journal (BL), he does find time to discuss the thirteenth- century cathedral at Lyon and here gives early notice of his interest in tracing Greek/Byzantine influence in Gothic art and architecture: French architecture 'of the time of our Saxon Gothic 'tho excessively barbarous has retained something more of the Greek ornament in the Churches of this part of France as may be seen in the Cathedral of S:1 John [,] the church of the Jacobins &amp;c'.4 In Italy he starts brusquely and on a very negative note dismissing the baroque exuberance of the magnificent churches at Turin which 'are of that bad taste of Architecture which succeeded the age of M:'Angelo, some having the plans of their fronts curved inwards with crowds of pillasters [,] broken pediments &amp;c'.5 At Milan, on the other hand, he responded well to the Gothic splendour of the Duomo: 'the effect is exquisitely light and beautiful'.6 At the Ambrosiana, he saw Raphael's cartoon for The School of Athens ; and at S. Maria delle Grazie, Leonardo da Vinci's fresco of The Last Supper which he praised for 'the noble and affecting manner in which the subject is treated'.7 At Parma he found merit in Correggio's celebrated picture H Giorno: 'there is som[e] grace, some affection and very fine Colouring with an originality of thought in the Composition'.8 And at Bologna he noted the 'simple &amp; poetical composition' of Raphael's St. Cecilia, an altarpiece in S. Giovanni al Monte, already familiar from Robert Strange's reproductive engraving.9 With the canonical status of the leading Italian Renaissance painters thus dutifully endorsed, Flaxman moves decisively under his own impetus to the bas-reliefs on the Porta Magna of S. Petronio, Bologna, executed by the Sienese artist, Jacopo della Quercia, and observed: 'the force &amp; beauty &amp; intelligence of their compositions and executions is very litde inferior to the greatness of M^Angelo or the delicasy [sic] of Raffaele'.10 This perceptive appreciation of the intensity and spirit of early fifteenth-century relief sculpture is followed by interesting comments on a room at the Academy, generally overlooked in travel books such as Martyn 1787, devoted to 'the works of the oldest Bolognese painters, who gradually reformed the Gothic manner, some of the earliest are much like those of Perugino, some others resemble the simple natural Characters &amp; expression of Massaccio [sic], Andrea del Sarto &amp; are very different from the twisted heads full bodies fluttering draperies small wrists and ancles &amp; bombastic attitudes introduced afterwards by some painters of this school . . .'-11 It is far from clear which Masaccio Flaxman had in mind at this juncture; perhaps he had studied the celebrated reproductive prints of the Brancacci chapel, Florence, published by Thomas Patch in 1770. Whatever, Flaxman was well prepared to confront the masterpieces of early Italian art that now awaited him at Florence. Here Nancy Flaxman writes in her own journal of the pleasurable prospect of spending an entire month in one place, after weeks on the road. Hitherto 'it had been all hurry &amp; bustle for some time before I quitted England and during the whole of this journey I had been much harass'd hav8 to manage for the whole party . . .'. Now instead her time 'was chiefly employ'd in putting to right some of the wrecks occasion'd by our journey &amp; visiting those Places where the fine things were'.12 However, for a full description of the works of art she defers to her husband. From the evidence of his own records, we find him at S. Croce studying the frescoes by Giovanni da Milano and Matteo Pacino in the Rinuccini chapel and Sacristy; at S. Maria del Carmine where he notes but does not copy or analyse the frescoes by Masolino and Masaccio; at S. Annunziata where he praises Andrea del Sarto's fresco cycle with Scenes from the life of Filippo Benizzi and The Birth of the Virgin 'in which nature is admirably imitated without any manner or affectation much like works of Massaccio [sic]', 13 here echoing his earlier enigmatic reference to Masaccio at the Academy in Bologna. 4</page><page sequence="13">flaxman: refocusing the grand tour Towards the end of the Florentine journal, Flaxman reverts to the subject of early Italian art, but now writes in a more art historical spirit, with a biographical focus, perhaps as a result of more detached reflection and possibly further study of Vasari. Indeed, there are good reasons for suppos- ing that this section of the journal was written retrospectively, after he had reached Rome; for instance, there are passing references to works of art to be found at Rome, not Florence. Flaxman now writes about Duccio's already celebrated Rucellai Madonna in S. Maria Novella, but follows the traditional attribution to Cimabue. Here he reveals his preoccupation with the potentially expressive language of draperies. The artist, he suggests, 'gave the Virgin a beautiful simple face[,] an easy turn of the head' and 'paid considerable attention to the folds and their joints in the drapery', softening the 'hard outlines the Greeks used to express the features &amp; rounded them &amp; the folds of the draperies with tender shadows'.14 Turning next to Giotto, he writes at length about the artist's façade mosaic (La Navicella), representing Christ in the storm, at St. Peter's, Rome, noting with approval 'natural good heads, attitudes well expressed, draperies understood &amp; a fine expres- sion &amp; just sentiment'.15 This leads him back to recollection of the now dispersed panels from an Armadio in the Sacristy of S. Croce, Florence, with scenes from the life of Christ, attributed then to Giotto but nowadays to Taddeo Gaddi: 'the compositions are distinct &amp; strikingf,] the perfection of the characters . . . the force of action and expression is astonishing &amp; a litde more Anatomy light Shadow &amp; perspective would have set them amongst the finest productions of human talents'.16 Although these panels, the majority now at the Accademia, Florence, had been noted by Martyn in 1767 and a few other guidebooks, Flaxman's close critical attention is noteworthy. A few years later, perhaps with his direct encouragement, the young English artist, William Young Ottley, and his Dutch friend, Humbert de Superville, would make a series of careful copies.17 Flaxman's interest in the fifteenth-century fresco (now destroyed) by Lorenzo di Credi of The Assumption of the Virgin on the outside wall of the convent adjacent to S. Croce is even more re- markable. It is not mentioned by Martyn, Lalande or Northall. Here Flaxman's critical response follows what is already becoming a recognizable formula: 'this composition is simple &amp; grand, the character innocent &amp; beautiful &amp; the folds of the draperies marked with intelligence'.18 Finally, after evaluating Nardo di Cione's The Last Judgement in the Strozzi chapel of S. Maria Novella - 'the Ideas seem to have been taken from Dante'19 - he concludes this long coda to the Florentine journal with Fra Angelico's Tabernacolo dei Linaioli, now at S. Marco but then (1787) still at the Uffizi: thus did the practise of Painting &amp; Sculpture go on for upwards of 100 years from Giotto to Massaccio [sic] with little or no improvement, the Professors were Ignorant of light shadow perspective &amp; Anatomy, but now was the time for the fine arts to be enriched with knowledge &amp; almost perfected by Brunelesco, Donatello, Ghiberti &amp; Massaccio.20 Flaxman's response to the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century sculptors was perhaps less academic and historical in spirit, and he brings a professional sculptor's awareness of practicalities and tech- nique that adds a note of spontaneity to his notes. Moreover, he was now more inclined to record his response not in words but by making drawings in a sketchbook now at Yale, which appears to have been used in tandem with the Fitzwilliam Journal. Indeed, one suspects that sometimes he put aside his guidebooks when addressing these sculptures; this might also explain one extraordinary lapse of connoisseurship to which we will return! The earliest work to catch his eye was Andrea Pisano's relief panels on the Baptistery door which Jonathan Richardson had undermined due to their 'Gothic style'. He goes on to suggest that Andrea Pisano's marble relief of The Creation of Eve 5</page><page sequence="14">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE (1337-40) on the Campanile, might have served as a possible prototype for Michelangelo's fresco of the subject in the Sistine chapel, Rome. In admiring Lorenzo Ghiberti's reliefs at the Baptistery Flaxman was following a more established Grand Tour tradition; but it was not the Gates of Paradise, already engraved by Thomas Patch and Ferdinando Gregori and published in 1774, but rather the New Testament scenes on the northern façade, that Flaxman elected to explore most thoroughly. He made a sequence of drawings in the Yale Sketchbook which focus on the low relief narrative but tend to ignore the physical context of each scene and to exclude naturalistic details in the immediate background.21 As he later wrote in his Lecture 'On Composition': 'it must be remembered, the work is sculpture, which allows no picturesque additions or effect of back- ground; the story must be told, and the field occupied by the figure and acts of man'.22 This view might also explain his relative lack of enthusiasm for the later Gates of Paradise where the scenes have complex and, for Flaxman, distracting architectural settings. Moving on to the Loggia dei Lanzi and Cellini's Perseus and Medusa, of which he made several copy drawings,23 Flaxman admires the head of Perseus for its beauty and grandeur and continues: 'the Contour is grand the attitude is Natural &amp; Noble, the parts are made out with great Intelligence . . .', before concluding, somewhat equivocally: Benvenuto might well be vain of this group, for except M:'Angelo &amp; John of Bologna, he certainly had not his equal in that or the preceding age amongst the restorers of Art &amp; it is wonderful so fine a group of that size should be the work of Man whose whole employment was chasing litde figures on plates and Ewers.24 In both the BL and Fitzwilliam Journals, Flaxman often speaks of Michelangelo, at least in theory, as representing the apex of modern artistic achievement towards which earlier artists had progressed. Yet confronted by the physical reality of Michelangelo's sculpture, which arguably challenges the bounds of naturalism and harmony, he often appears uncertain in his response. He misattributes Michelangelo's famous statue of David to Bandinelli, an extraordinary mistake perhaps made on a day when he mislaid his guidebooks!25 He ignores The Lamentation in the Duomo, but on a subsequent visit in 1791 or 1794 rectifies the omission when he makes a rather tame copy, emphasizing its surface rather than its more emphatic angular form.26 He notes, but without com- ment, the Medici tombs and the allegorical figures of Day and Night in S. Lorenzo, but records their external appearance, without engaging with their structure, in a series of full frontal drawings in the Yale Sketchbook.27 Later, in his Lecture on Modern Art, he would express admiration for the 'pensive sitting figure of Lorenzo dei Medicis' and acknowledge the 'grand and mysterious' allegorical figures, while regretting the absence of 'the chaste simplicity of Grecian art'. In fact, he seems to have felt more at ease with Michelangelo's work as a painter and the 'sublime' achievement of the Sistine Chapel.28 Giambologna's mannerist and virtuoso style also unsetded Flaxman. In his journal he refers to the 'very extravagant bad taste' of the Tritons and Satyrs of the Neptune fountain, beside the Palazzo Vecchio.29 However, The Rape of the Sabines, which he copied in the Yale Sketchbook in 1787, and to which he returned in 1794, on his way home to England, in V&amp;A Sketchbook (E 442-1937), is judged 'a very fine group',30 perhaps because of its debt to classical prototypes such as The Wrestlers in the Uffizi. Within the context of his response to Giambologna and Michelan- gelo, one is left with the impression that Flaxman was more interested in the spirit, vision and progressive scientific efforts of earlier sculptors and painters to progress towards the classical harmony and technical skill of the Renaissance, than he was in the efforts of those who had brought 6</page><page sequence="15">flaxman: refocusing the grand tour this process to a conclusion and had arrived on Parnassus, to retain their stylistic balance and avoid relapsing into bombast, extravagance and exaggeration. Paradoxically, it is in Flaxman's response to the antique sculpture at the Uffizi, iconic images that had been an integral part of the prescriptive Grand Tour itinerary throughout the eighteenth century, that one finds the clearest expression of his art historical method and the underlying focus of his engagement as a practising artist with the art of the past. Confronted by the best antique sculpture, much of which was already semi-familiar through casts and engravings studied in England, he was preoccupied by its physical properties, and questions of authenticity and restora- tion. We find him reflecting on attribution and chronology, based on his reading of Pliny's Natural History, and linked to a desire to understand the progressive evolution of antique art and for modern sculptors to apply its principles. In the same spirit he looks at Etruscan bronzes and puzzles over their origin. In his responses to individual sculptures he employs language that is more analytical and explicit than that associated with writers such as Richardson and Cochin whose observations incline towards the rhetorical and whose connoisseurship was governed by the con- cept of formal and physical beauty. Flaxman primarily is interested in clarity of purpose, firmness of line, expression of the passions, and lightness of proportion. He writes in his journal of the 'sublimest Character &amp; Expression' of the Niobe group;31 of the 'grand outline' of the Young Mars ;32 of the 'originality of conception' reflected in Cupid with an apple.33 As for the Venus de Mediä : 'the Marble is of so tender a tint &amp; transparent, the appearance of the flesh so soft with a gende polish on it, the attitude is so graceful &amp; seems so much in motion together with a charming lightness of proportions that the whole effect is exquisite'.34 Towards the end of the journal, as with the adjacent notes on early Italian artists, he made notes from Pliny on the ancient artists; these too may have been added after he had reached Rome.35 And here, explicidy, he also records his own purpose: 'the foundations of Art being in Science it is absolutely necessary for genius to be assisted by rules, &amp; which they are &amp; how far they may be applied to the Arts of design is the object of the present enquiry'. He then continues: as we have unfortunately lost the writings of the Ancient Artists these rules should be sought in the finest of their remaining works, for as the same cause produces the same effect, so these being found and demonstrated works of equal excellence may be produced again.36 Thus, in his historical analysis of ancient Greek classical sculpture and the subsequent decline of this tradition under the Roman Empire, we find an almost exact parallel to what Flaxman was simul- taneously looking for in his intense study of the progress and development of early Italian art and artists. Ironically, the British traveller whose detailed visual analysis of individual works of art in the Uffizi collections ran along critical lines closely parallel to Flaxman's at this time was Edward Gibbon, author of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published between 1766 and 1788. But whereas Flaxman's aim was to track artistic progress, Gibbon's fundamental historical position was focused on describing a spiral of dechne. If we compare Gibbon's travel journal of 1764, which Flaxman never saw, since it was not published until 1961, 37 with Flaxman's Italian notes made at the Uffizi, we find that they looked at the same material, both antique and medieval, in much the same way (cf. quotations from Gibbon on antique sculpture in the footnotes of the transcribed Fitzwilliam Journal), but with a different historical perspective, and thus often reached diametri- cally opposite conclusions! For instance, while Flaxman admires a set of marble busts of Emperors 7</page><page sequence="16">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE and their families from Julius Caesar to Carinus as 'very useful as well for the likenesses as for to shew the Style of Sculpture in the different ages',38 Gibbon writes pessimistically: 'c'est un plaisir bien vif que de suivre les progrès et la decadence des arts et de parcourir cette suite des portraits originaux des maitres du monde'.39 Equally when Gibbon describes, what many ignored, 'une suite de tableaux des plus anciens maitres depuis la renaissance de la peinture' where 'on peut suivre tous les pas qu'a fait cet art jusqu'à sa perfection . . he then feels obliged to conclude on another negative note, observing, 'Les premiers peintres etoient des artisans: obligés de passer par une Mechanique longue et penible, ils osoient à peine se livrer aux essors d'un talent qu'un siècle ignorant aurait meconnû [sic]'.40 Flaxman, in contrast, was forever looking out for the green shoots of renewal. As Francis Haskell has demonstrated, Gibbon provided the inspiration for the French antiquar- ian scholar Séroux d'Agincourt's illustrated survey, Histoire de l'Art par les Monumens depuis sa décadence au 4tne Siècle jusqu'à son renouvellement au i6me Siècle, in effect a comprehensive account of the decline of art from the time of Constantine the Great until the sixteenth-century Renaissance, published at Paris from 1810-23, but already well advanced by 1789 when political disruption undermined its smooth path to publication.41 The French work was essentially an illustrated elaboration of Vasari, mapping the decline of art from Roman times until its slow resurrection from the thirteenth century onwards through Cimabue and Giotto. Yet, paradoxically, as part of that process it drew attention to much early art that had interested Flaxman in Italy (but not, apparendy, Séroux d'Agincourt) for its own sake and on its own terms, through its expressive power and spirit. In Rome Flaxman completed the Fitzwilliam Journal with notes and thumbnail sketches on the antique sculpture at the Villa Ludovisi and at the Vatican museum. His wife meanwhile tells us of their apparently somewhat casual visit to the Via Appia, with its mausoleums, churches, and catacombs.42 However, after only a month, unhappy with their lodgings and with the prospect of a free lift to Naples, they resumed their Italian tour. At Naples Flaxman started a new journal/ sketchbook, now at UCL, transcribed and catalogued here by Alison E. Wright, which is focused almost exclusively on archaeological material, and reflects the obsessive interest of a well-informed antiquarian. He describes the antique sculpture at Portici, especially the two Balbi family eques- trian portraits; he describes ancient paintings taken from Herculaneum and Pompeii, but was more impressed by their design - 'simple grand and beautiful' - than their execution, suggestive of derivation from grander prototypes. He displays an antiquarian delight in recording domestic objects recovered from excavation, and armour decorated with bas-reliefs. He records tombs from Pompeii and the Doric temples at Paestum. Curiously, he leaves his wife to record visits to see the frescoes by Roberto d'Oderisi in S. Maria Incoronata, arguably the finest remaining examples of Neapolitan fourteenth-century wall painting.43 More predictably, it is again Nancy who describes their ascent of Vesuvius and their peregrinations through the antique sites north of Naples, such as the Grotto of Pausillipo, Virgil's tomb, Solfaterra, the Grotto del Cane, the Temple of Jupiter Seraphis, Pozzuoli, Piscina Mirabile, Cento Celle, Miseno, Lake Avemus, the Grotto of the Cumaean Sibyl, and Cuma.44 Such sites, regularly described since Franciscus Schottus, translated by Edmund Warcupp in 1660, were an established part of the Grand Tour, especially for those with a good classical education, like Addison, who is said to have 'travelled through the poets , and not through Italy'. For Flaxman, however, it was the memory of the ancient art and decorative objects he had seen and copied at Portici and elsewhere that fuelled his imagination as he began to prepare his own illustrations to the Iliad and Odyssey. 8</page><page sequence="17">flaxman: refocusing the grand tour Back in Rome Flaxman began serious work as a sculptor, and started two new sketchbooks, both now in the V&amp;A, both transcribed and catalogued here by Eckart Marchand. One of vertical format (E 442-1937) was primarily devoted to life drawing, funerary monuments, and studies of classical and Renaissance sculpture in the round, including works by Cellini and Giambologna in Florence that Flaxman had recorded in 1787 and revisited, probably during a month's stay in June 1794 on his way home to England. In other words, it is the sketchbook of a working artist, not a traveller's record. The second sketchbook, of oblong format (2790), was evidendy chosen specifically to record antique bas-reliefs, some early Italian relief sculpture, and occasionally a fresco detail seen at Siena, Lucca, Pisa, or Florence in February 1791, or at Orvieto in September 1792; and finally a few monuments, recorded at the end of the album, while passing through Siena, Florence, Verona and Innsbruck in the summer of 1794 on the way back to England. The style of the drawings in this important sketchbook is quite different from the far more routinely drawn copies in the Yale Sketchbook of 1787. Although from 1788 onwards Flaxman still copies works as a record of his travel, he now also engages far more imaginatively and creatively with what he copies, often con- centrating on a detail, without context, and reducing the forms to sketchy linear two-dimensional images. And he no longer maintains a written journal. At this juncture, Flaxman also exhibits remarkable critical independence in his decision to copy a mosaic of The Nativity in the apse of S. Maria Maggiore which mistakenly he believed to date from the fifth century (although Martyn 1787 had dated it 1289);45 and Cavallini's mosaics of The Birth of the Virgin and The Death of the Virgin in S. Maria in Trastevere.46 In 1791 he went north to Carrara to buy marble and stopped en route at Siena where he had paused only briefly on the way to Rome four years earlier.47 He now took time to copy two relief panels from the cathedral font: Ghiberti's St. John before Herod and Donatello's Presentation of John the Baptist's head to Herod.48 Three further copies from N. Pisano's pulpit may also date from this time, although their position in the sketchbook might indicate a slighdy later date after the artist had turned round to return to Rome.49 Finally three years later, on the way back to England in 1794, Flaxman again returned to Siena to copy two panels, The Agony in the Garden and Christ returning to the Apostles, from Duccio's long-neglected and dismembered Maestà, originally placed on the high altar of the cathedral.50 He also copied the wall tomb of Cardinal Petroni by Tino di Camaino (1318),51 and returned to the pulpit to copy a detail of five of the damned from Nicola Pisano's The Last Judgement.52 Medieval painting and sculpture at Siena Cathedral was rarely noticed by the relatively few tourists who seriously visited the city; its popularity followed after influential publications in the nineteenth century by C. von Rumohr in 1827, Alexis Rio in 1836 and Lord Lindsay in 1847.53 The principal exception in the eighteenth century is Thomas Keysler, whose journal, published in 1756, was based on Italian travel in 1729-30. He describes Nicola Pisano's panels on the pulpit, and the bassi-relievi on the font, but without attribution or reference to Ghiberti or Donatello.54 It might well have been Keysler's book that alerted Flaxman to Nicola Pisano's litde-noticed Deposition lunette above the left portal of Lucca Cathedral which he copied on the 1791 tour.55 We then find Flaxman at Pisa, at the Campo Santo, a well-known nostalgic haunt for Grand Tour travellers, although few made much sense of the early frescoes. Flaxman selected two vivid and expressive details: a group of angels from Buffalmacco's The Last Judgement,56 and five lepers from The Triumph of Death,57 both of which he attributed to Orcagna . He also made two drawings 9</page><page sequence="18">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE based on Bonanno da Pisa's relief panels on the portal of S. Ranieri at the cathedral, although, as Marchand has shown, they are only loosely related to the originals.58 He returned to these bronze reließ on the way to England in 1794 and made further copies.59 Back in Florence on the 1791 tour, he returned to Ghiberti's panels on the north door of the Baptistery, copying Christ among the Doctors;60 and he also made a copy of the relief by Brunelleschi of The Sacrifice of Abraham (Old Sacristy, San Lorenzo) which had been submitted as a competition piece for the same door.61 At S. Lorenzo he addressed the two Donatello pulpits, overlooked in 1787, and copied details of The Entombment and The Descent into Umbo. He would return in 1794 to copy The Three Maries at the Tomb.62 The Flaxmans were back at Rome by mid-March 1791. The arrival in 1792 of William Young Otdey, the charismatic young English artist and collector, with an obsessive interest in Michelan- gelo, must have added gready to the Flaxmans' intellectual and social life, and his name recurs frequendy in Mrs Flaxman's social diary (BL Add. MS 39792(A)), from May 1792 until March 1794, a few months before the Flaxmans finally left Rome on 2 June to return to England. Indeed, Nancy appears to have become quite obsessed by him, noting his comings and goings in and out of Rome, his evening visits to their quarters and even his quarrelsome mood at a Christmas dinner in 1793 !63 For Otdey, on the other hand, we have no surviving diary or notebooks, merely the large portfolio of drawings made after works of art seen in Italy (intended for engravings to illustrate his own book on Florentine painting, published in 1826), which are presented in the second part of this volume. In Italy we first find a record of him in Florence in February 1792 copying Michelangelo's Medici tombs at S. Lorenzo, Florence (Figs 3 &amp; 4), and The Lamentation, then in the Duomo64 (Fig. 6), with far more conviction and awareness of depth and angular forms than in Flaxman's copies (Figs 1, 2 &amp; 5). By April he is at St. Peter's Rome copying Michelangelo's Pietà (Fig. 8); again, the contrast with Flaxman's more decorous copy in the V&amp;A Sketchbook (E 442-1937) is striking (Fig. 7).65 All these Otdey drawings after Michelangelo, which are signed and dated, are now in the Séroux d'Agincourt archive at the Vatican Library. It would appear that Otdey had lost little time before becoming employed by the French scholar on his monumental project Histoire de l'Art par les Monumens which, as noted above, was already well advanced. Otdey, however, like Flaxman, was inclined to find much to admire about the early Italian art before Michelangelo which Séroux d'Agincourt, echoing Gibbon, saw largely as a symptom of the decline of the Roman empire and which he reproduced in his volumes merely to prove that point. From the circumstantial evidence, it would appear that Otdey, after successfully completing the Michelangelo copies (maybe as a trial) was commissioned, by Séroux d'Agincourt, in the period 1 793-98, to make further, far more ambitious, copying expeditions to Assisi, Horence, Perugia and Pisa. First, however, in September 1792, he persuaded the Flaxmans to accompany him to the Duomo at Orvieto not only to see Maitani's celebrated façade, but also to admire the Signorelli frescoes of The Last Judgement in the Cappella di S. Brizio, which were widely believed to have inspired Michelangelo. The impetus for this expedition may well have been the publication in 1791 of Guglielmo Della Valle's elaborately illustrated Storia of Orvieto Cathedral, with a substantial series of engravings, Stampe, after drawings by the local artist, Carlo Cencione, who had also been employed there by Séroux d'Agincourt. At Orvieto Flaxman made an uncharacteristically careful and detailed black chalk drawing of Maitani's relief of The Last Judgement, on the centre of the façade, even recording its measurements; this is now at the BM and does not form part of an existing sketchbook (Fig. 9).66 It succeeds in 10</page><page sequence="19">flaxman: refocusing the grand tour Fig. i Flaxman after Michelangelo, Tomb of Giuliano de' Medici , Yale Sketchbook, f. 23 r.

IX (Fig. 10). In the oblong sketchbook (V&amp;A 2790) he made a free linear sketch of one of the Signorelli grisailles in the Cappella di S. Brizio, representing Nudes in Combat, which conveys the rhythm but not the detail of the original.67 Otdey meanwhile appears to have done little, perhaps preparing the groundwork for a far more extended visit the following year with the Dutch artist Humbert de Superville, with whom he appears to have collaborated closely for the remainder of the 1790S, but whose name appears to be entirely absent from Mrs Flaxman's social diary. Evidently there was a fruitful exchange of ideas between the three artists during the period 1792/93. Ottley's intimate drawing of Flaxman modelling by candlelight in his studio (Frontis- piece) may well date from this moment.68 Ottley copied two of Flaxman's drawings in the Yale Sketchbook of Ghiberti's relief panels on the Baptistery Florence; these remain in his portfolio collection presented in this volume69 (cf. Figs. 11 &amp; 12, with 13 &amp; 14). For some reason he then made an independent copy of a third panel of The Nativity which Flaxman had also copied (cf. Figs. 15 &amp; 16). In return, Ottley added to Flaxman's sketchbook two pen drawings with details from the Orvieto façade, one of which, Adam and Eve hiding (Fig. 17), is close to Cencione's drawing engraved by Leonetti in Della Valle 1791, pl. XIII (Fig. 18), while the other, Noli me tangere, appears to match a copy made by Humbert de Superville, which is now at Venice.70 There is also a copy of an Angel from The Crucifixion at the Campo Santo, Pisa, which Otdey probably made in 1792/93, although no visit to Pisa then is documented.71 Conversely, the two striking details from 13</page><page sequence="22">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE Fig. 9 Flaxman after Maitani, The Last Judgement, British Museum inv. 1888, 0209.17.

Lorenzo pulpits in Florence, described above, which precede the elaborate copies, obviously made for reproduction, drawn by Humbert de Superville for Ottley in 1798. 73 During this period Flaxman met Séroux ď Agincourt himself, and became closely associated with d'Agincourt's principal engraver, the remarkable Tommaso Piroli, who also engraved Flaxman's drawings after Dante's Divine Comedy (commissioned 1792 and published 1807), the Homeric epics The Iliad (1793) and The Odyssey (1795); Ottley's drawings of Twelve Stories of the Life of Christ (1796); and many of the reproductive prints used by Ottley in his own book on Florentine art (1826), with a dedication to John Flaxman. Tommaso Piroli remains an elusive personality. His earliest recorded activity appears to be a rare oblong folio printed drawing book, in the possession of the present writer, entitled Principi del disegno ricavati dalle più corrette opere degli antichi e di Raffaelle , ordinati ed incisi da Tommasom Piroli Vanno MDCCLXXXVIII , published and sold at Rome by Bouchard &amp; Gravier, by Romero and 'presso l'autore'. Here we find twenty-one prints, some after tracings from Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican Stanze, as well as others engraved after anatomical drawings, and further images related to the various branches of the art of drawing. The volume (no other copy has been located) is inscribed in ink: Mrs Hare Naylor No. 8. It is not clear if the inscription was made by the artist, the English owner or an intermediary, but it strongly suggests that Mrs Georgina Hare-Naylor (d. 1806), who later, c. 1793, commissioned Piroli's outline prints of Flaxman's drawings illustrating The Iliad and The Odyssey , had already become an admirer of the Italian printmaker by c. 1788. And the Hare-Naylors then feature regularly in Mrs Flaxman's social diary at Rome from 1791-94 and in her correspondence. Together all these art lovers surely must have debated the relative claims of Cimabue and Giotto to be regarded as the originator of the reforms that drew a line under the dark ages. Doubtless they argued about the curiously neglected contribution of Guido da Siena and the Sienese school, championed by Guglielmo della Valle in an open letter to Séroux d'Agincourt, published in 1782, as well as in his edition of Vasari, published in 1791; but refuted by M. Lastri in Etruria Pittrice , also published in 1791, who insisted on the priority of Cimabue and the Florentines over Pisa and Siena, a view with which Ottley would have concurred. Maybe it was at this juncture that Flaxman too arrived at his most original insight into the origins of early Christian art which he later expounded in his Lectures, first delivered in London in 18 10 and published in 1829. Flaxman came to believe that within the Byzantine tradition of Christian art, despised in the respective writings of Vasari, Gibbon and Séroux d'Agincourt and ignored by Winckelmann, lay an essential but fragile link with the classical world, and that the origins and iconography of fourteenth», fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Italian art, painting and sculpture, were to be traced back to the Byzantine/Greek style and the compositions of the early Christian mosaics, paintings, illuminated manuscripts and ivory carvings, as well as early Christian Roman sculpture in the catacombs. Flaxman, after describing the general decadence of Roman sculpture, would later write in his Lecture on Composition : From this abasement of sculpture in Italy we shall willingly turn again to the compositions of the Greeks, and observe that this people, who had embodied the false divinities of Olympus, and widely spread their fame by the perfection of their representations, the same people were the first to declare the sacred oracles of truth, under the Christian dispensation, by the mute eloquence of painting and sculpture . . . Some mosaics, ivory carvings, and illuminations, which have escaped the destruction of Moslem fanaticism, abundantly indicate the beauty of those more considerable works we have lost.74 16</page><page sequence="25">flaxman: refocusing the grand tour Fig. 15 Flaxman after Lorenzo Ghiberti, The Nativity, Yale Sketchbook, f. jr.

After identifying a series of compositions adopted by Italian artists from the Byzantines (Adam and Eve, The Nativity, Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Last Judgement), he continues: Grecian composition may be traced in the biblical basso-relievos of Orvieto by Nicolas and John Pisani; in the noble bronzes of the life of Christ on the pulpits of St. Lorenzo in Florence, by Donatello; on the bronze gates of St. John's Baptistery, in the same city, by Lorenzo Ghiberti, and in the paintings of Raphael and Michael Angelo. 20</page><page sequence="29">flaxman: refocusing the grand tour He reverts to the same idea in his Lecture on Modem Sculpture : It will be found on a careful inquiry, that the elements, as well as the perfection of the arts, have always been received, either immediately or intermediately, from the Greeks, by Western Europe, although this has been denied by Vasari; and as fer as concerns the Greek Christian paintings, does not seem to have been even suspected by Winckelmann. And thus he concludes: The germ, or first beginning of modern art, is not to be so absolutely reckoned from the commencement of the eleventh century ... as from the reign of Constantine, seven centuries earlier, when Christianity became the established religion of the empire; then it was that painting and sculpture ceased to be employed on the pagan gods, and their powers were engaged to adorn the churches built by Christian emperors with the persons and events of sacred history.75 We have to wait until the mid-nineteenth century before we find British scholars, notably Lord Lindsay, taking this idea much further. Lindsay, after extensive travel to Ravenna and Venice, and an exhaustive analysis of Byzantine architecture, as well as of iconography in mosaics and frescoes dating from after the council at Constantinople in 692, concluded in his turn that there was a series of images where Italian painters had adopted traditional compositions derived from the Byzantines and established formal conventions that would endure until the sixteenth century. He appears to have been surprised, then, to discover that Flaxman had anticipated him and in a generous footnote was probably the first to acknowledge Flaxman's insight.76 The question remains as to how Flaxman reached this position, after his own relatively limited exposure to Byzantine images in Italy; surprisingly, he never visited Assisi, did not apparendy Unger at Venice on the way home, and certainly never went to Ravenna or Ancona. Turning instead to books, predictably he cites Paolo Arringhi's Roma Subterranea Novissima In Qua Antiqua Christianorum . . . (1671), an extension and perhaps more readily accessible version of Antonio Bosio's Roma Sotterranea (1632, or 1651 edn), surveying Christian art in the Roman catacombs. More significandy, he directs us to The History of Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, by Pierre Monier (1699), the French classical artist (1641-1703) who became one of the first students at the Academie de France, at Rome, and who 'gives large quotations from the Christian Fathers concerning the excellent paintings of sacred subjects in the Eastern churches, from the fourth to the eighth century and the powerful effects produced by them on the beholders'.77 Maybe he also read the Dissertazione on Italian painters and sculptors in Italy active from 1000 to 1300, highlighting artistic activity in Italy before Cimabue, written in 1757 by the antiquarian scholar Giovanni Lami (1697-1770; otherwise best known for his lectures at the Accademia del la Crusca on the Etruscan origins of Florence), which had only just been published in 1792.78 Even supposing Flaxman had also immersed himself in such illus- trated books as Lastri's Etruria Pittrice, published in 1791, which reproduces 'Greek' frescoes at S. Miniato al Monte, Florence, and paintings by Guido da Siena, Buffalmacco and Giunta Pisano,79 and had also seen the drawings made at Assisi by Otdey and Cencione in 1792 and 1793 (for which see under Otdey Collection Catalogue below), and even speculating on the possibility that he had been shown proofs of some of the plates of Byzantine art from Séroux d'Agincourt's corpus which only began to appear in 18 10, Flaxman's independent intellectual position remains remarkable. Yet before we become too intoxicated by his insights, we should remember that Flaxman was not, like Lindsay, a scholarly writer and art historian: indeed, his well-intentioned chronology of Greek sculpture was flawed (although Della Valle consulted him over passages in Pliny before publishing 21</page><page sequence="30">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE his own Vite dei pittori antichi greti e latini in 1795);80 his perceptions about Byzantine art were perhaps as intuitive as they were unfashionable; and ultimately he was simply an extremely consci- entious practising artist, with a high moral purpose, striving for clarity so as to perfect his own style, both in drawing and in religious monumental tomb sculpture. Flaxman's severely classical outline engravings made in Italy reflect not only his own developing classical style of drawing, Une without shadow, in which form is reduced to linear rhythms, but also the added precision imposed. by his engraver, Tommaso Piroli. He displays a semiotic intention, to which he alludes in his Lecture on Beauty: 'Every passion, sentiment, virtue, or vice, have their corresponding signs in the face, body and limbs which are understood by the skilful physician and physiognomist . . .'.81 As Deanna Petherbridge has written: 'the Flaxman who excites interest today as a precursor of modernity is Flaxman the drawer: an artist devoted to reducing form to pure line, narrative complexity to syntactical clarity, and bodies to an alphabet of signs'.82 If this reductive style owed much to the study of Greek vases in Italy and in the plates in D'Hancarville's catalogue of Sir William Hamilton's collection,83 it may also have been inspired both by the schematic but expressive forms of Byzantine art and the simplified rendering of draped figures, animated by extreme emotion, as found in such painters as Giotto. Yet essentially Flaxman's expressive and retardataire neoclassical style, which ignores Renaissance perspective, but which in its emotional language also goes far beyond the seicento Italian concept of the affetti, depends upon 'an emerging psychological language of pure unmediated response to forms in and of themselves'. Charles Dempsey, in an essay on The Greek Style and the Prehistory of Neoclassidsm, with particular reference to Testa and Poussin, who like Flaxman had been deeply immersed in antiquarian knowledge a century and a half earlier, directs our attention to the concept called expression by the French, that was intensely moral, 'simultaneously identifying the perfected forms of antiquity not only with expression at its most intense but also with a beauty that in its ineffable and irresistible perfection embodies the very idea of truth itself. We find this perhaps in Poussin's Richelieu Bacchanals from the mid-ió30s, in his second series of Sacraments, and maybe above all in his designs of c. 1642 for the Grande Galerie of the Louvre, which Dempsey specifically selects as possessing 'a purity of style that might raise the envy of a John Flaxman or Bertel Thorwaldsen'. And he concludes: With this fundamental change in emphasis a truly classical criticism in its actual modern meaning, a criticism based not in reason alone but also in the paired concepts of an ideal beauty derived from Greek models and an instinctive moral response to the forms in which such beauty is embodied, begins its slow road to ascendancy over an earlier criticism of natural perfection based in a concept of the rational work- ings of universal laws of nature deduced from the art of antiquity in general as well as from the masters of the High Renaissance.84 Flaxman's engagement during his travels in Italy with the natural but idealized beauty and propor- tion of Greek sculpture, the expressive symbolism of Byzantine images, and the narrative energy and simple story-telling of early Italian painting and sculpture, provided a historical context within which he might define and strengthen his own classical style. It also played a greater part than he might have realized in refocusing the objectives of the Grand Tour for future nineteenth-century visitors, as well as our own responses to Italy's complex artistic heritage. To appreciate this we need to take account not only of his considerable artistic output and his published Lectures, but also the evidence of what he read, the company he kept, and above all his day-by-day encounters with individual works of art, as recorded so vividly and with such immediacy in the sequence of Italian Journals and Sketchbooks which we present here. 22</page><page sequence="31">flaxman: refocusing the grand tour Acknowledgements The points of departure for any discussion of Flaxman's travel abroad are David Irwin's Flaxman monograph 1979 and David Bindman's RA exhibition catalogue 1979, both listed in the Bibliography.

Although Monier 1699 draws attention to the artistic legacy of the Byzantines, and to artis- tic activity in Italy before Cimabue, he by no means endorses such early art on grounds of quality; on the contrary, at p. 73, he distinguishes between 'the Antient Way* and 'the Antient Greek Way', and writes critically of the style introduced 'by certain Greeks to the Year 1200, for in all their Works both of Painting and Sculpture there is nothing to be seen of Curi- ous, but on the contrary of a monstrous Design, such as are the Works in the Churches on this side the Mountains, which are called Gothick : Thus the Old Greek Way, and not the Antient Way, and the Gothick are the same, the one being as ill as the other*. 78 Lami 1792, pp. liii-botii. He also writes of artistic activity in Italy before Cimabue (p. btii) as follows: 'E giacché della maniera Greca torna qui in acconcio il parlare, mi si conceda il riflettere che il Vasari, più per opportunità di causa che secondo la verità, pretese avanzare che tutte le pitture e scul- ture anteriori a Cimabue fossero sfatte e cattive, dileggiandole con dire: erano esse di maniera Greca: Il gusto era Greco; dalle quali frasi probabilmente nacque allora il proverbio che dice è fatta alla Greca per dinotare una cosa malfatta e deforme'. He continues (pp. bcxi-lxxii): 'Ed ecco confermato con gli esempi istorici la mia fissata proposizione, cioè che dal mille fino ai tempi in cui fiorì Cimabue vi furono in Italia sempre Pittori e Scultori Italiani che non lasciarono mai perire arti sì belle, e se molti rozzamente e goffamente l'esercitarono, ve ne furono però alcuni che molto laudabilmente vi lavorarono, e forse con maniere le quali quelle di Cimabue non invidiano'.

Florence was the first destination on this journey where they could visit a substantial collection of works from classical antiquity. Following the pattern set by earlier Tourists, the couple spent a considerable time in this city before continuing to Rome.1 The Grand Duke's Collection in the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti included a small number of extremely well-known antique sculptures, such as the Venus de' Medici and the Wrestlers, familiar to Flaxman through reproductions in print and/or plaster, as well as a few other outstanding, if less well-known, works that impressed the sculptor.2 Yet, he paid equal, if not greater attention to the large number of works from later periods, including also paintings, in the city. Once his journey had brought him to Rome, he abandoned this broad oudook and concentrated almost entirely on sculpture from classical antiquity. Works from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance came back into his focus only when he travelled north to towns such as Orvieto, Siena, Lucca, Pisa and, again, Florence, in 1791 and 1794.3 Following the chronology of Flaxman's encounter with the originals, the present article will first study Flaxman's reception of Italian post-antique sculpture and then turn to his encounter with works from classical antiquity. The journals and sketchbooks published in the present volume are crucial for our understanding of Flaxman's reception of ancient, medieval and Renaissance art. Dating from different stages of the seven years that Flaxman spent in Italy, they served different purposes. These will be discussed below, but some general points need to be introduced at this stage. The British Library Journal (henceforth: BL Journal), half-journal, half-sketchbook, in its journal section generally emulates the patterns set by other Grand Tourists. Flaxman's remarks on sculpture, painting and architecture form part of a wider travel account that also includes comments on landscape, engineering projects, town planning, and the regional character of the population. Following the common trajectory of the Grand Tour, Flaxman was confronted with a fixed canon of works recommended and commented upon in published travel accounts that functioned as guidebooks.4 The text in his own journal differs from these in that he applied his own, independent aesthetic judgement when looking at the recommended works of art.5 The sketchbook part of the BL Journal shows Flaxman deviating from the canon and launching into terra incognita : on the look out for works in a classical style, he studies reliefs and an eighteenth-century Temple of Love both in the grounds of the Duke of Bouillon's castle in northern France,6 sixteenth- and eighteenth-century tomb monuments in Paris,7 and a plaster cast in Parma after the ancient bronze sculpture of the Praying Boy, the original being then in Potsdam, now in Berlin.8 In Milan he draws two of the reliefs by Giovanni Pietro Lasagna (1629-40) that form part of the seventeenth-century western portals of Milan Cathedral, rarely mentioned in any literature. Following precedent, he calls these 'Grecian', which in the context of the Gothic building may be read as 'classical'.9 25</page><page sequence="34">ECKART MARCHAND The Yale Sketchbook and Fitzwilliam Journal both start in Florence. Here Flaxman is still following the patterns of the Grand Tourist; the journal provides a description of the monuments and buildings of Florence paired up with comments on the Grand Duke's government. Flaxman continues this journal in Rome, but after a substantial description of the Ludovisi Collection he abandons it, either overwhelmed by the size of the task of describing this city's collections, or simply from lack of time. The sketchbook maintains its Grand Tour character throughout: it contains studies after a wide range of monuments and motifs compiled in Florence and Rome that would have been visited by the typical British visitors or that would at least have appealed to their taste. The only two or three post-antique works that feature in the Roman section of this sketchbook Flaxman encountered in the Grotte Vaticane. They include the tomb of Hadrian IV, the only ever English pope (1154-59); and even this depicts a reused classical sarcophagus.10 The notes Flaxman wrote into the last pages of this sketchbook date from 1788 to 1791,11 but given the consistent character of the volume it is attractive to assume that the drawings were completed at an early stage of Haxman's time in Rome. The University College London Journal, again half-journal, half-sketchbook, covers the journey to Naples, Pompeii and Paestum in . 1788 and follows in many ways patterns of the Grand Tour. The two V&amp;A Sketchbooks are very different in scope. The oblong V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, begun between 1788 and 1791, is particularly suitable for the depiction of frieze compositions of the kind found on sarcophagus reliefs and was in fact largely used for this purpose.12 V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, on the other hand, was apparendy acquired for the purposes of life drawing.13 Both volumes contain sketches after antique and post-antique works, and Flaxman took them with him on his journeys into Tuscany. In Florence Flaxman started his new journal not, as one might have expected, with a discussion of the classical collection in the Uffìzi, but with a description of mosdy sixteenth-century public sculptures in the Piazza della Signoria.14 Earlier comments on Renaissance and baroque sculptures can be found in the BL Journal, though they are limited. In Turin, Flaxman dismissed everything baroque;15 in Piacenza he scarcely mentioned Mochi's equestrian monuments of the Farnese Dukes (1612-20 and 1621-25 respectively) attributing them to 'a Scholar of John of Bologna' who, according to Flaxman, had 'followed the style of his Master whom Winckelman [51c] judiciously calls the destroyer of art',16 and in a more detailed mention of Giambologna's Neptune (1567) in Bologna he notes that the main figure was 'extravagant bombastic &amp; affected in its action &amp; knobby in the manner of making out the anatomy'. He also rejects the motif of the 'mermaids on ^ Pedestal, sitting &amp; squeezing water from their breasts' as 'whimsical &amp; indelicate'.17 Large-scale secular sculptures, especially groups representing classical themes in the tradition of the Niobides and Laocoön, were at the top of an eighteenth-century sculptor's ambitions, and Flaxman himself would engage in three such works while staying in Rome.18 The choice of six- teenth-century sculpture for the opening pages of the Fitzwilliam Journal is therefore highly sig- nificant; yet Flaxman's attitude towards sixteenth-century public sculpture is complex and selective. Thus, the negative criticism of Giambologna, initially stated in such generalizing terms, is only upheld in relation to specific monuments, namely the abovementioned Fountain of Neptune in Bologna and to the basin figures ('in a very extravagant bad taste') of Ammanati's homonymous Fountain in Florence (1563- 1 75). 19 His criticism of these works focuses on issues of decorum ('whimsical', 'extravagant'), and an overtly muscular rendering of the male anatomy ('bombastical', 'knobby in the manner of making out the anatomy'). His equally dismissive comment on Bandinelli's Hercules and Cacus (1534) is by no means original, but consistent with these criteria.20 26</page><page sequence="35">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS But when it comes to Giambologna's Rape of the Sabine Woman (1581-82), displayed in the Loggia dei Lanzi, and Hercules and the Centaur (1595-1600) (Fig. 5), then in Via de' Rondinelli, Flaxman's judgement about the artist's work is much more positive. Fully familiar with the formal qualities of the Rape of the Sabines through small-scale plaster casts and a full-scale cast formerly in the Duke of Richmond's Gallery, he does not draw it, but comments upon it as 'a very fine figure'.21 He also mentions the full-scale clay model of it in the Florentine Academy, although this might also relate to his interest in sculptors' practice.22 On one of his later visits to Florence, either in 1791 or 1794, he was to make two small pen and ink sketches after this sculpture.23 This time, though, he completes two studies of the Hercules and the Centaur that are discussed below (Fig. 6). 24 He also relates both groups to the antique, commenting in front of the Wrestlers in the Uffizi that 'John of Bologna seems to have studied this Group particularly by the composition of his Hercules &amp; Centaur &amp; the Rape of the Sabines'.25 Of all the sixteenth-century sculpture he studied, it is Cellini's Perseus (1554) (Fig. 1) that provoked the strongest and most unreservedly positive response in Flaxman. During the first visit to Florence, Flaxman explored the bronze sculpture and its complex pedestal through a set of three drawings, including a highly analytical study of the prone figure of Medusa, as if seen from above.26 Later on, he would return to the work, adding a view from the back (Fig. 2) and a number of additional profile studies of the main figure to the earlier frontal view.27 Equally breathtaking as some of these drawings is his description of the group in the Fitzwilliam Journal. Here Flaxman displays his profound knowledge of classical mythology, his skill in describing the group and pedestal verbally and some familiarity with Cellini's autobiography.28 He describes the head as 'beautiful &amp; grand', comments on the 'Contour' as being 'grand' and describes the 'Attitude' as 'Natural &amp; Noble'.29 This might give us an indication of Flaxman's own ideal of the Heroic. The discussion of the group ends with a general evaluation of Cellini's position in the canon of art; Benvenuto might well be vain of this group, for except M1: Angelo &amp; John of Bologna, he certainly had not his equal in that or the preceding age amongst the restorers of Art &amp; it is wonderful so fine a group of that size should be the work of [a] Man whose whole employment was chasing little figures on plates and Ewers.30 Flaxman, the designer of Wedgwood tableware and small-scale wax médaillons , may well have been thinking of his own aspirations to venture into large-scale secular sculpture when he wrote these lines. Michelangelo, whom Flaxman mentioned in the above statement, was certainly the unchal- lenged giant of the sixteenth century, celebrated by Vasari, and almost ever since, as the apex of the canon of art. In the BL Journal, the Florentine sculptor is nothing less than an institution, lending his name to an entire period. Flaxman describes works being made 'about the time of Michael Angelo'.31 If, in one case, this is replaced by 'about the time of Peter Torrigiano',32 then this should serve as a useful reminder that Flaxman, who had studied the funerary monuments in Westminster Abbey as a young man, would have known Torrigiano's work through originals, Michelangelo's only through casts and/or prints.33 In fact, the modern reader is left bemused by Flaxman's ignorance in front of Michelangelo's David (1501-04), a sculpture that he ascribes to Bandinelli without any knowledge of its iconography.34 Michelangelo's undoubtedly most famous sculptures, the tomb monuments in the 27</page><page sequence="36">ECKART MARCHAND Fig. i Benvenuto Cellini, Perseus , 1554, Florence, Loggia dei Lanzi. (Conway Library, The Courtauld Institute of Art) Fig. 2 Study of Cellini's Perseus from the back, I794(?), V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 123. New Sacristy of San Lorenzo (1524-34), are simply mentioned in the journal, but Flaxman completed four drawings inside the chapel; three of the tomb of Giuliano (a full view and two details of the allegorical sculptures Day and Night) and one of the central niche and portrait figure of the tomb of Lorenzo de' Medici.35 Towards the end of his stay in Italy, he would also study Michelangelo's Pietà (1497-1500) in St. Peter's in Rome, the Florentine Lamentation (1550-54), then still in the cathedral, and, again, the tomb of Giuliano de' Medici.36 These drawings, arguably, form part of a series of studies of wall-mounted tomb sculpture, undertaken in the context of the preparations for the Mansfield tomb commission.37 Many of them render diagonal views, very uncommon for Flaxman but responding to the specifics of his own task, and they even include a study after the tomb of Alexander VII by Bernini (1672-78), the baroque sculptor who was anathema to all neo-classical artists.38 Thus, as discussed below, these are drawings that Flaxman did in preparation for his own work, not as an immediate response to the style and qualities of the work. In conclusion, Flaxman's view of Michelangelo's work may not have developed beyond a conventional acceptance of his extraordinarily high canonical status and his value as a tomb 28</page><page sequence="37">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS designer.39 Flaxman's above-mentioned rejection of the overtly muscular male figure in the works of Giambologna and Bandinelli might also indicate that his admiration for Michelangelo would have had its limits. The term 'Renaissance' was not coined yet, but when in the passage about Cellini's Perseus he singled out Cellini, Michelangelo and Giambologna as not having their equal 'in that or the preceding age amongst the restorers of Art', Flaxman showed himself familiar with Vasari's periodization of what the author of the Lives called 'modern art'.40 As to the 'preceding age', for Flaxman this term may have included, if not denoted, the fifteenth century. During his first stay in Florence, Flaxman's reception of Quattrocento sculpture focused almost entirely on Ghiberti's northern Baptistery doors (1403-24), of which he drew seven panels.41 Ghiberti was not an unknown quantity for the typical Grand Tourist, but it was his second set of Baptistery doors, the Gates of Paradise (1425-52) that was mainly associated with his name.42 Their fame was not alien to Flaxman either, who commented on the Florentine Academy's set of casts after them, stating that these plaster copies were 'the only doors in the world worthy to be the entrance to a fine School of Art'. At some stage during his seven years in Italy Flaxman acquired a cast of one of its panels.43 If Flaxman's enthusiasm for Ghiberti is highly unusual for his period, his response to Donatello in the Yale Sketchbook and Fitzwilliam Journal is more typical; there are no drawings after this artist's work and the comments on Donatello's Judith and Holofernes (1457-64) are extremely critical: 'the composition is poor the attitude of Judith tame, that of Holofernes unnatural[,] the drapery ill conceived, the naked parts excessively Poor'.44 While for a modern Renaissance scholar these comments appear entirely unjustified by the visual evidence, what they may be based on is a perceived lack of classicism, instant legibility and clarity of outline, as well as issues of decorum. In fact, in an age that venerated the Apollo Belvedere, fifteenth-century Italian sculpture in the round had little to offer. There are no studies after any of the large-scale statues by fifteenth-century Florentine sculptors in Flaxman's sketchbooks. The Yale Sketchbook holds one drawing after a Florentine work from the thirteenth century; Andrea Pisano's relief of the Creation of Eve ( c . 1337-40). This formed part of the decoration of the Campanile of Florence Cathedral which was known to be based on a design by Giotto, and, when sketching it, Flaxman expressed his belief that this relief, too, was designed by the early fourteenth- century artist. In the Fitzwilliam Journal, Flaxman also mentioned this particular relief, speculating that Michelangelo might have looked at it (presumably in relation to his own Creation of Eve in the Sistine Chapel). However, at some later stage, Flaxman revised the attribution to Giotto in favour of the correct one.45 Giotto was of course a much better known quantity than Andrea Pisano and the perceived connection to Michelangelo may also account for Flaxman's engagement with the work; still, the drawing and separate comments demonstrate a recognition of the formal qualities of the early fourteenth-century relief with its bold outlines and bulky figures. Later on in Rome, Flaxman was to meet William Young Ottley who was making drawings after works of this period; but at this stage Flaxman's response was apparently independent and unsolicited. On his later journeys to Pisa, Orvieto, Siena, Lucca and, finally, Verona, Flaxman would study reliefs, and sculptural monuments from the fourteenth, thirteenth and even twelfth centuries, including panels from Bonanno da Pisa's Portal of St. Ranieri (twelfth century), Nicola Pisano's Siena Pulpit (1265-68) and Deposition from Lucca Cathedral (1258), Tino di Camaino's funerary monuments in Siena (Petroni, 1318) and Florence (Gastone della Torre, 13 19), the reliefs from the façade 29</page><page sequence="38">ECKART MARCHAND of Orvieto Cathedral (early fourteenth century) and finally, in a slight sketch, the extraordinary Scaligeri tombs at Verona (fourteenth century).46 While still highly unusual for the time, his interest in Italian late medieval art was by then shared with Ottley.47 In Rome, Flaxman made a few drawings after thirteenth-century mosaics in S. Maria Maggiore and S. Maria in Trastevere. These decorations of the early Christian basilicas were not only regularly seen by Catholic pilgrims, but featured also in the travel accounts of Grand Tourists, such as Lalande, who like Flaxman believed them to be early Christian. Flaxman may have valued them as early expressions of the Christian faith,48 and it might mirror eighteenth-century ideals that he chose three intimate domestic scenes: the Nativity from S. Maria Maggiore and the Birth and the Death of the Virgin from S. Maria in Trastevere. Later in his lectures Flaxman would express the theory that, like ancient classical art, Christian art, too, originated in Greece (i.e. Byzantium), arguing that scenes such as the Nativity and the Transfiguration were developed by Greek artists and adopted in Italy.49 THE DRAWINGS Flaxman's drawings after post-antique art can be subdivided into studies after reliefs, after painting or mosaic, and after free-standing sculpture. Not surprisingly, drawings after reliefs dominate. Among these the largest group after a single work are the eight drawings after Ghiberti's first set of Baptistery doors, seven of them being executed during the first stay in Florence in 1787. Assuming that Flaxman completed the Yale Sketchbook in chronological order, it appears that he drew first a selection of three panels, consisting of the Nativity (f. 7r), the Agony in the Garden (f. 8r) and the Crucifixion (f. çr), the second time he studied the Raising of Lazarus (f. i7r) and the Transfiguration (f. i8r), and when he returned for the third time he drew the Expulsion of the Money Changers (f. 2ir) and Christ in the Storm (f. 22r). The first three drawings are intimate and contemplative scenes, all of which include crouching and reclining figures. Seen together as a group they demonstrate an economical approach to copying that is typical for Flaxman.50 The Nativity is rendered in some detail and the shapes of the panel and its frame are clearly outlined. Having stored this information once, Flaxman does not repeat himself, and in the other two drawings the framing devices are only faindy indicated. Yet, the reductive technique of the Crudfixion drawing also enables Flaxman to bring out the elegant design of the panel with its symmetrical display of curved outlines that frame the cross. Returning to the gates for a second time, Flaxman engaged with the Raising of Lazarus, recording again the outlines of the figure composition without much reference to the picture field. He rendered the isolation of the figure of Lazarus with the unnerving void under the hood formed by the shroud, and realized the beauty of the figure of Mary Magdalene prostrate before Christ, but ultimately he seems to have been unable to translate the complex interaction between Christ on the right, the women in the foreground, the aposdes behind them and Lazarus on the left into his own much less complex style. A happier result was achieved in his study of the hierarchically structured Transfiguration. Flaxman develops this drawing to a relatively high degree of finish which he did not attempt in the Raising of Lazarus. The final two drawings after the panels of the door are both very delicately drawn and wash is used for detailed tonal modelling. In fact, while working on the Raising of Lazarus Flaxman may have realized that Ghiberti's densely packed figure compositions are based on the carefully 30</page><page sequence="39">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS differentiated modelling of each individual figure in light and could therefore not be translated into simple outline drawings. In The Expulsion of the Money Changers (Fig. 4) Flaxman simplifies the architectural background and eases the turmoil of the group on the right by simply omitting the quattrefoil frame, crucial to Ghiberti's composition, and emphasizing an overall movement from left to right. A comparison between the drawing and a photograph of the panel (Fig. 3) demonstrates how Flaxman recorded this panel clearly from below, but rendered the bottom strip as if seen at eye level. This gives the impression of relief figures that are seen front on, but results in a distortion of the proportions. This may be interpreted as an attempt to represent an ideal image rather than the site-specific appearance of the work, a point that will be discussed in greater detail below. Flaxman's choice of these seven panels may to some extent reflect an interest in specific motifs, such as bulky seated or kneeling figures, shown in contemplation, exhaustion, mourning or prayer, as well as intimate and contemplative scenes. In the Raising of Lazarus and the last two studies he engages particularly with Ghiberti's clustering of figures, where these are welded together into groups, but individually characterized through their expressions and movements. Nearly all other drawings after medieval or Renaissance reliefs and paintings can be found in the oblong V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, while most free-standing sculpture is drawn in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937 with its portrait format.51 This suggests that in most cases Flaxman had both sketch- books available. As mentioned above, the format of V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790 was particularly suited for frieze compositions, typical for sarcophagus reliefs. Using the book for the study of Renaissance reliefs, Flaxman would now in most cases focus entirely on the figurai part of the compositions.

(Conway Library, The Courtauld Institute of Art) Fig. 4 Study of Ghiberti's Expulsion of the Money Changers, Yale Sketchbook, f. 2ir. 31</page><page sequence="40">ECKART MARCHAND Thus, in his last drawing after a panel from the northern Baptistery doors, Christ among the Doctors , possibly achieved in 1792 or 1794, he only reproduced two-thirds of the overall picture field.52 Starting with the seated figures on the left, he chose a figure size that hardly allowed him to fit in the standing figures on the right, let alone the architecture. In the case of Brunelleschi's competi- tion panel for the north door (1401-02), it is the two-tiered composition of that panel that allowed Flaxman to split the composition horizontally and record it in two separate drawings,53 but in his studies of the reliefs of the baptismal font in Siena by Ghiberti and Donatello (between 141 7 and 1427)54 and the reliefs by the latter for the San Lorenzo pulpits (commissioned in 1460), 55 Flaxman extracted the figure composition, ignoring most of the architectural staging of the figures, as well as the complex shapes of the picture fields. The concentration on the frieze-like depiction of the significant human action may be seen as a deliberate abandoning of any distracting staging or accidental shape of the picture field and as such, a manifestation of Flaxman's neo-classical aesthetic.56 On the other hand they also come together with the introduction of more rapid drawing techniques around the time of Flaxman's arrival in Rome.57 Like these, they may relate to the different nature of the V&amp;A Sketchbooks that, in contrast to the Yale Sketchbook, do not serve a Grand Tourist who carefully records works of art in their own right, but rather the professional sculptor who is studying motifs for the purposes of his own work. Flaxman's drawings after larger fresco or relief compositions from the Middle Ages were subject to the same selective and time-saving approach. Here he picks out individual figures or small vignette-like clusters of figures, rather than recording the complete composition.58 Only in two drawings did Flaxman fully cross the border between drawings after originals and the free translation of a composition into his own idiom.59 In both cases, Flaxman drew first the outlines of the original figure composition, but then rethought the composition to clarify the design. In Ghiberti's St. John before Herod (V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 2ór) he remodels the right-hand side of the composition in a faint sketch next to that of the original composition, while in the case of Bonanno da Pisa's bronze relief of the Raising of Lazarus (V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 37r) he apparently started from a faint drawing of the original scene, but rather than retracing this under- drawing, he developed a new composition on top of the original one, turning the packed square scene into a long, frieze-like design with large, simplified forms and one single directional impulse from left to right. DRAWINGS AFTER SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND Flaxman's drawings after post-antique sculpture in the round are highly analytical, showing an interest in the poses and outlines of individual figures, rather than recording them from dominant viewing angles. Thus, for example, in the case of the two drawings after Giambologna's Rape of the Sabine Woman he does not depict any of the dramatic views that are offered to someone standing in the Piazza della Signoria. Instead he draws the group from inside the Loggia dei Lanzi, choosing two views that enable him to reveal the logic of the poses of all three figures as well as the relation- ship between the carved sculpture and the shape of the original marble block. Similarly, seen together, the two drawings of Giambologna's Hercules and the Centaur (see, for example, Fig. 6) enabled him to understand the structure of the poses of the two figures and how they are entwined. What the drawings do not convey is a sense of the dramatic impact of these figures as volumes in 32</page><page sequence="41">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS Fig- 5 Giambologna, Hercules and the Centaur , 1595-1600, Florence, Loggia dei Lanzi.

Instead they are used in a more abstract way to signify different levels of relief. STUDIES OF FUNERARY MONUMENTS The other group of drawings after post-antique sculpture is that of funerary monuments; it was first recognized and discussed by David Irwin who suggested that a number of studies of tomb monuments in St. Peter's, Rome, related to the commission to Flaxman of the Monument for Lord Mansfield in Westminster Abbey.60 All of them are in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937 and a few other drawings in the sketchbook also form part of the group, including an additional study of Michelangelo's tomb of Giuliano de' Medici, the Lamentation of Christ then in Florence Cathedral by the same artist and a few life drawings.61 The group includes frontal views, sketched ground plans and, a rare feature among Flaxman's studies, oblique views.62 The drawings provide informa- tion about the spatial organization of the monuments, but they are mainly concerned with the site-specific appearance of these monuments as experienced by viewers who approach them from different directions. Contrary to Flaxman's usual practice, light and shade are used for tonal modelling and record the actual fall of light. Thus, these are task specific studies. In fact, Flaxman approaches this task with such an open mind that he even studies the tomb of Alexander VII by Bernini, and makes notes about the different types of coloured marble used by the baroque sculptor that are so important for the appearance of the work, and must have sent a shiver down 33</page><page sequence="42">ECKART MARCHAND Flaxman's spine.63 These observations recall his discussion of the natural occurrence of coloured marbles in the Savoy Alps that he related to their extensive employment by baroque artists in Turin whose work he despised.64 Both instances demonstrate Flaxman's ability to observe and engage with works that he would have otherwise rejected. In the case of the study of Bernini's monument, this is particular surprising, given the strong rejection of this sculptor by neo-classical artists.65 It demonstrates an open-mindedness and ability to approach analytically works of art, despite contemporary attitudes opposed to them. It may well have been this ability that enabled John Flaxman already during his first sojourn in Florence to recognize the formal and sentimental values of medieval and early Renaissance works. FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS AFTER ANCIENT SCULPTURE Having looked out for classical forms throughout his journey, it was only in Florence that Flaxman encountered a substantial collection of works from classical antiquity. Some of these he knew through reproductions in print or plaster.66 In the Fitzwilliam Journal he gives an exhaustive descrip- tion of the Uffizi, the highlight of which is his beautifully composed description of the Venus de' Medici.67 Here we witness Flaxman's first encounter with a famous original that he knew through copies. The sculpture does not feature in his sketchbook, nor does he describe the pose. Instead, his description focuses on the facture of the original: he records breaks, losses and modern additions, describes the marble, records traces of antique paint in the hair and notes that originally a metal ring must have adorned the right arm. Finally, he comments on the ancient sculptor's technique, 'this figure was finished intirely with the tool without a rasp', and how this contributes to the overall 'effect' of the sculpture.68 Only eleven of the first twenty-seven folios of the Yale Sketchbook's Florentine section are after ancient classical works, depicting altogether only six works, although, one of these is the multi-figure group of Niobe and her Children . Together with the Venus de' Medici, this group was one of the most famous antique works in the collection and the entire western world.69 Again, Flaxman does not include the well-known central sculpture of Niobe and her Youngest Daughter . Three drawings of that sculpture can be found in the later, Roman, part of the sketchbook and are with all probability based on a plaster cast.70 Flaxman studied two other classical groups in Florence, the then famous Hercules and Antaeus in the courtyard of the Palazzo Pitti,71 originally from the Vatican Belvedere, and Bacchus standing leaning on a Faun,72 a sculptural group considered important enough at the time to be reproduced in plaster next to the Venus de' Medici in the Florentine Academy where Flaxman mentions it again.73 The remaining six drawings are of a Cupid throwing an Apple at Jupiter ,74 Cupid shooting an Arrow,75 and the Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpent.76 The Florentine collection of antiques, though outstanding and acclaimed, was still relatively small at this time and the most famous sculptures well published. An explanation ex negativo , though, cannot account for Flaxman's repeated study of these sculptures of young, chubby male bodies. Flaxman emphasizes their softness, delicacy and roundedness, as well as the playful and joyous sweetness of the two Cupids' poses. They may have appealed to him as classical models for figures of youthful innocence; similar figures of young children reappear in his later tomb monuments.77 When it comes to the Roman section of the Yale Sketchbook, the broad outlook of the Grand Tourist manifests itself in the variety of objects, motifs and themes that Flaxman records, without 34</page><page sequence="43">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS the clear focus of the practising sculptor that can be sensed in the later V&amp;A sketchbooks. Thus he studies free-standing classical sculpture, sarcophagus reliefs, imperial monuments,78 architectural decorations and even classical furniture.79 Mrs Flaxman's diary from the initial stay in Rome gives a glimpse into the couple's extensive schedule of daily visits to collections, churches and ancient monuments during the time between their arrival in Rome and departure for Naples.80 It has already been mentioned that the two V&amp;A Sketchbooks reflected rather the sculptor's professional interest than the broad outlook of the Grand Tourist. V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790 was apparently bought for oblong sarcophagus reliefs and contains a large number of these. The only drawings after classical reliefs to appear in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937 depict the more compact compositions of gem engravings, for which the upright format of this sketchbook was better suited.81 Apart from these studies and the life drawings for which it was apparently bought, V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937 contains studies of classical sculpture in the round, including two distinct groups of drawings after sculptures Flaxman studied in Florence. They consist of studies after large- scale statues in the Uffizi,82 and after Etruscan small-scale bronzes in the same collection.83 They are distinct not only in terms of their subject matter, but also with regard to the drawing techniques employed. FLAXMAN'S DRAWING TECHNIQUES The studies after sculpture are amongst Flaxman's most beautiful works on paper. Most of them are characterized by extremely fine, tentative graphite underdrawing, re-enforced in pen and ink and wash, or thicker, more decisive graphite lines. Until his arrival in Rome, Flaxman used, with some variation, one standard technique involving graphite, pen and ink and wash. Initially, he would establish the outlines of his image with very faint, short and thin graphite lines. In some cases these lines could be extremely short, some inter- connected, some parallel to one another, occasionally building up an 'area of contour' rather than an actual outline.84 In a second step he would re-enforce with pen and ink the outline or insert an inked outline into the mentioned area of contour. These outlines were rather thin; varying thick- ness was used to emphasize the contour and indicate depth. While these pen and ink lines are made to join up, they, too, are hesitant in character, vary in tone (through a change of pressure) and give the impression of fragility and delicacy. In a final step, Flaxman would apply grey wash, not so much to record actual light effects or to achieve tonal modelling, but to indicate, in a rather abstract way, different levels of depth. Thus, in his drawing of Bachus standing leaning on a Faun (Fig. 7), Flaxman applies wash to Bacchus' hip where the left hand is moved before it, to clarify the spatial relationship.85 Pentimenti occur regularly in the underdrawings, but are also not unfrequent in the pen and ink outlines; the most dramatic ones relate to problems with the initial scaling and positioning of figures in relation to the dimensions of the relevant page. Thus, when drawing sculpture groups, Flaxman occasionally started with one figure, only to find that he had positioned it too high on the page to accommodate another, taller figure of the same composition.86 Other instances where Flaxman typically struggled include the positioning of limbs that are moved away from the body.87 The doubling of outlines, sometimes a pentimento , is occasionally used to indicate volume. One can only speculate how much of any one drawing Flaxman actually produced in front of the original. The existence of a number of unfinished drawings only executed in faint graphite 35</page><page sequence="44">ECKART MARCHAND could be taken as evidence that the fixing of the outlines in pen and ink and application of wash may have happened at a later stage in the comfort of his home. Flaxman's use of wash as an indicator of depth in areas of overlap does not require any direct observation of the model, and, as both ink lines and wash require periods of drying, executing them at home would have saved Flaxman valuable time in front of the originals. After his arrival in Rome, Flaxman began to introduce different drawing techniques.88 The lines of his underdrawings, though still very faint, grew more confident, indicating that he drew faster and less hesitantly, frequently employing a broader pencil.89 Rather than retracing these lines with pen and ink, Flaxman now started to fix the design with broad and bolder graphite lines and indicated difference in volume and depth through slight changes in the tone and width of the outlines.90 Graphite hatching is used instead of wash for internal modelling and the indication of varying degrees of relief. Over time, Flaxman developed this technique to such perfection that some of his broader graphite marks may be mistaken for the much softer black chalk, while others, thinly applied with maximum pressure, appear like pen and ink marks.91 During the last years of his stay, Flaxman would use both techniques with some variation. All life drawings in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937 are produced solely in graphite, as are most of the classical reliefs in V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790. The above-mentioned groups of drawings after gems and Fig. 7 Study of Bacchus standing leaning of a Faun , 1787, Yale Sketchbook, f. i6r. Fig. 8 Study after (cast of?) ancient gem, Mercury Psychopotnpos , V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 69. 36</page><page sequence="45">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS Etruscan small-scale sculptures respectively, as well as those after large-scale sculpture in the Uffizi, are executed in pen and ink. In the case of the drawings after gems, Flaxman uses this technique also for shading, imitating the linear technique of the stone cutter (Fig. 8), while in the case of the Etruscan statuettes he achieves delicate effects of internal modelling through the additional application of wash (Fig. 9). Again, this is a reaction to the specific character of these small metal sculptures that, like the individual figures on Ghiberti's Baptistery doors, discussed above, gain large part of their aesthetic appeal through delicate surface modelling. The formal values that Flaxman emphasizes in these drawings form a strong contrast to his more common emphasis of the outline.92 But these variations in technique may not only be responses to the works under examination;93 the sketchbooks also suggest a more general development back to pen and ink drawings towards the final period of Flaxman's time in Italy. The two groups of drawings after sculptures in the Uffizi, drawn most probably during the five-week stay in Florence in summer 1794, are also rendered in this technique, as are the last drawings of classical reliefs in V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790.94 One possible explanation would be that pen and ink drawings, especially where hatching is used instead of wash, provide clearer models for an engraver. While there is no indication that Flaxman intended to reproduce any of these drawings, he had at this point worked on his Homer, Aeschylus and Dante illustrations,95 and may have appropriated this technique and style more generally. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DRAWINGS AND THE STUDIED WORK The discussion of Flaxman's drawings of sixteenth-century sculpture groups has highlighted their analytical character and suggests that they tend not to convey the dramatic appearance of these Fig. 9 Two studies after Etruscan bronze statuettes, V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, P. 113. 37</page><page sequence="46">ECKART MARCHAND works in the light. This discussion can now be expanded, taking into account studies of both classical and post-classical works. Flaxman's default view is the frontal. Where a second view is provided, this is usually a profile, as, for example, in the case of the so-called Sabine Woman in the Loggia dei Lanzi that Flaxman copied twice on the same page of V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937.96 When copying large-scale works he prefers a distant viewpoint that neutralizes the dramatic impact of the towering size of the work and restores legibility and clarity to the design. The two studies of the tomb of Comte Caylus in Paris provide an instructive example. Here Flaxman abandoned an initial drawing in which he had rendered the tomb from nearby, as the resulting foreshortening of the various parts of the monument had led to a distortion of the proportions and meant that some parts of the design were obscured by others. A second drawing, from a greater distance, was worked up to the usual degree of finish.97 The Horse Tamers on the Quirinal are among the largest sculptures Flaxman studied. The sketchbooks provide us with six drawings of the left-hand (the supposedly Phidian) one and one of the right-hand (Praxitelean) sculpture. Flaxman studied the complex poses of these figures from the front, the side and the back, choosing the most distant viewpoints possible in all but one case. For the side views of the left-hand (Phidian) Horse Tamer , the maximum distance of less than 10 metres was dictated by the façade of the Palazzo della Consulta, the views from the back were taken from roughly 1 8 metres away, while the frontal view is drawn from the corner of the Palazzo del Quirinale, c. 35 metres away from the object.98 Flaxman attempted one drawing from nearer by, exploring the dramatic foreshortening. Tellingly, this study was never worked up and, while Flaxman did preserve it, he used the rest of this page for studies of Etruscan statuettes.99 By drawing sculpture from far away, Flaxman not only provides a clearly legible design, he also abstracts further from object-specific appearance in terms of scale and surface qualities. In fact, without knowledge of the specific object or the genre it belongs to, it is difficult to judge from Flaxman's drawings the actual dimensions of the originals.100 When it comes to the reproduction of classical, especially sarcophagus, reliefs, a frontal view might appear an obvious choice; yet, one should bear in mind that many of them were integrated into façades and courtyards well above eye level. Given the relatively small scale of the individual motifs in this genre, it would have been undesirable to increase the viewing distance even further. Still, Flaxman's studies of reliefs such as the Discovery of Achilles (Figs. 10- 11) from the façade of the Villa Borghese, and the Bacchic relief from the garden façade of the Villa Medici (Figs. 12-13) do not acknowledge the low viewpoint. Instead, Flaxman silently corrected the perspectivai distortions and depicts the works as seen at eye level. The only indication of the difficult viewing conditions in the Discovery of Achilles is that Flaxman mistook the head of one of the daughters of Lykomedes for that of a horse.101 The description of the Venus de' Medici in the Fitzwilliam Journal demonstrates an antiquarian, if not archaeological, concern for the actual object.102 The necessity for the antiquarian to distinguish between original passages and modern reconstructions had been emphasized by Winck- elmann and others, long before Flaxman's time. In fact, at the time of Flaxman's journey this discourse was already reflected in the travel literature.103 It was also practically enforced in late eighteenth-century Rome when, for example, in the Farnese collection the Renaissance restora- tions of the Hercules and Flora Farnese were revised in 1787 and 1800 respectively.104 Flaxman frequently voices an awareness of modern restorations105 and in a few drawings he omits modern 38</page><page sequence="47">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS Fig. io The Discovery of Achilles in Arcadia j neo- Attic sarcophagus relief, second century ad, Paris Musée du Louvre, formerly Villa Borghese, façade.

This practice can be found already in the Yale Sketchbook, indicat- ing, like the description of the Venus de' Medici, that Flaxman had developed this antiquarian concern well before he embarked on his journey. Amongst the most obvious examples are the drawings after some of the reliefs from the façade of the Villa Medici106 and after the Attic relief from the Palazzo Barberini.107 The modern extensions to the picture fields of the original works may be rather obvious, but in the drawing of the Barberini relief Flaxman shows a particularly antiquarian concern by indicating the borders of the original fragment. Henry Tresham's roughly contemporary drawing of this work offers an instructive comparison both in its stylistic distance to the original and through the inclusion of the modern additions that double the relief in height.108 Further evidence for Flaxman's antiquarian concern is presented by a drawing after a relief from the Mattei collection depicting figures from the Rape of Proserpina}09 From the start, Flaxman only allocated enough space for the central abduction scene and the immediately flanking figures, both of which are modern. While he includes these modern figures in his drawing, only the original figure of Pluto is worked up.110 Similar cases can be found amongst Flaxman's studies of free-standing sculpture. Thus he omits the restorations of the Nymph and Panther in the Uffizi111 and depicts a Minerva from the Borghese collection in Rome without its limbs.112 This does not mean that Flaxman did not study works that were pastiches and/or largely restorations, or that he always understood the subject matter of the works he looked at. But it is certain that he had considerable philological and antiquarian interests and ambitions.113 The closeness of Flaxman's drawings to the works he studied, whether ancient, medieval or later, relates partly to these antiquarian concerns. Even a single figure executed in faintest underdrawing from an abortive study of a multi-figure composition can convey enough informa- tion about style and outline of the original detail to enable the informed viewer to make initial assumptions about the type of object Flaxman had copied, rule out close alternatives and, if lucky, achieve positive identifications.114 His studies of gems not only reproduce the motifs faithfully, the linear medium (pen and ink) and Flaxman's handling of it emulate the stylistic qualities of the originals, both in relation to the technique of stone cutting, and the period of production.115 No eighteenth-century prints after gems achieve such a faithful rendering, and it is obvious that Flaxman must have worked from original gems or, more likely, casts after them.116 Typically for the period, this concern for the faithful recording of the underlying model does not extend to accidental appearances, such as surface damages or a work's adaptation to specific viewing conditions. Ghiberti's panels for the north door of the Florentine Baptistery were modelled in response to the low viewpoint of the beholder. Thus, for example, the ground strip of these reliefs is frequently tilted and figures look downwards as to render their faces legible to the beholder. As Ghiberti was working in three dimensions, he also responded to the possible range of different angles of vision and allowed for changing and/or alternative interrelations between figures according to the viewer's position in front of the work. Flaxman's studies after these reliefs invariably represent an ideal image that is seen at eye level with all figures fully legible and the iconographically and/or formally most significant relationships permanently established.117 In his drawings after works from antiquity the already discussed 'neutral' views - from the front and/or side and far away - demonstrate a similar focus on the underlying idea rather than the accidental appearance of the work. All this relates to Flaxman's approach to damaged works. 40</page><page sequence="49">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS The textual evidence regarding the Venus de' Medici and other works demonstrates Flaxman's awareness of surface conditions. In his drawings, though, he makes no attempt to render any dam- age, as the comparison of the Bacchic relief from the Villa Medici (Fig. 12) with Flaxman's drawing after it (Fig. 13) demonstrates.118 Flaxman's approach to damaged works differed from that of other, earlier periods. In the Renaissance it was the fragmentary state of the work that signalled its authenticity as an ancient work, and draughtsmen of that period would regularly record the dam- ages to and fragmentation of the works they copied.119 It was part of the rationale of neo-classical antiquarianism to present the original idea, the complete sculpture, rather than the damaged object with its accidental appearance. In the second half of the nineteenth century German classical archaeologists would still give preference to drawings over photographs, as the latter were believed simply to record the appearance of the works, while the skilled artist was able to visualize the original idea.120 It is consistent with Flaxman's neo-classical concerns that, occasionally, he includes the restored heads of figures, as for example in the case of the above-mentioned Barberini relief and the Ludovisi Satyr and Nymph. While not part of the original design, these additions allow the viewer to understand the composition.121 THE FUNCTIONS OF FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS The copying of classical sculpture, often facilitated through the medium of plaster casts, was part of any academic training and as a formative experience an end in its own right. Flaxman had made drawings after plaster casts and original monuments in London as part of his early training and ever since.122 At the outset of his journey he was 32 years old, had a profound knowledge and under- standing of ancient art, literature and mythology and was a fully formed artist. Nevertheless, drawings like his studies of Ghiberti's reliefs and ancient and Renaissance sculpture groups were invariably products of a process of appropriation. While producing them, Flaxman attempted to understand and grasp the works under scrutiny, to realize the principles of their design and to translate them into his own pictorial language with its preoccupations about outline and clarity of design. Thus, the drawings and the process that led to their completion were, to some extent, purposes in their own right. Other functions have already been mentioned in this article. Most prominently there is the group of drawings Flaxman made in preparation of the Mansfield tomb monument. This function had a clear impact on technique and choice of viewpoint. Other drawings may have been made with the production of drawings for sale in mind. A clue can be found among the above-mentioned accounting notes in the final pages of the Yale Sketchbook. Here Flaxman lists several drawings after classical reliefs that had been produced for Mr Edward Knight of Portland Square in London.123 They include drawings of a Discovery of Achilles (Fig. 11) and Triumph of Neptune, both subjects that are represented in V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, 124 but also a Contention of Eros &amp; Anteros, possibly to be identified with the classical relief Flaxman had studied during his stay in Evreux.125 One wonders indeed whether the three carefully worked up studies of the above-mentioned Temple of Love and its relief had already been made with such a commercial purpose and possibly the owner, the Duke of Bouillon, in mind, or whether the artist just recognized the classical relief as an appropriate subject to include when he discussed the commission of the drawings with his patron, Edward Knight.126 Other drawings that would have lent themselves particularly well for such purposes are the studies after the cathedra of St. Gregory the Great and the sarcophagus of the 41</page><page sequence="50">ECKART MARCHAND only ever English pope, Hadrian IV. These and a number of other drawings depict works that would have been of particular interest for the Grand Tourist, and the attractive layout of the pages is similar to that of contemporary publications of classical Roman objects.127 When drawings of this type were sold, they would have left his possession. The sketchbooks, on the contrary would have stayed with Flaxman. Not entirely dissimilar to the plaster casts from the various stages of his work that Flaxman kept in his workshop, these drawings formed visual records that he could use for a variety of artistic, antiquarian, and teaching purposes. They could be revisited by him or shown to friends;128 later he may have made copy drawings of them for use during his Royal Academy lectures.129 In fact, the illustrations of the posthumously published text of these lectures go back to drawings from the sketchbooks.130 Finally, it has frequently been argued that they served as a large stock of classical motifs that he would later have been able to draw upon when developing his own designs, be they outline drawings or sculptures. David Irwin identified a number of classical and Renaissance models for Flaxman's works,131 and Symmons discusses this type of eclectic approach as part of a neo-classical aesthetic that valued the direct copying of clas- sical sources.132 While there is no doubt that the drawings fulfilled such a function, I would argue that in most cases 'copying' is not the right term to be used, especially when seen in comparison with the close relationship between these drawings and the antique or post-antique originals they were based on. During his stay in Rome, Flaxman worked on three large-scale secular sculptures, Aurora visiting Cephalus on Mount Ida (1789-90), The Fury of Athamas (1790-94) and Hercules and Hebe (1792). While the latter is an attempted reconstruction of the Torso Belvedere and has therefore obviously a very close relationship to that monument, Irwin has also righdy shown that in the Fury of Athamas Flaxman quoted direcdy from the Hellenistic groups of Laocoön and Niobe and her Youngest Daughter. These references are particularly significant as Flaxman likened his own work with the Laocoön.133 Similarly, in Aurora visiting Cephalus on Mount Ida, Flaxman strongly drew on the Apollo Belvedere134 and a figure of Nike of which he owned a plaster cast and had made two drawings.135 All of these works were well known in Rome and beyond (with the possible exception of the Nike), and the motifs are complex enough to be recognized as quotes, even though Flaxman modified individual details. In other cases where studies in Flaxman's sketchbook have been suggested as models for his illustrations or later tomb monuments, one finds similarities to rather than copies of poses and motifs. These similarities may represent a direct recourse to the individual drawing in Flaxman's work, but could equally be a more general result of Flaxman's appropriation of a classical pictorial language.136 In fact, direct quotes are extremely rare; even the rendering of classical furniture or objects, such as helmets, does not reappear in his own designs without modifications. What is obvious, though, is that knowledge of them informed his work.137 None of Flaxman's drawings after existing works answers any one particular purpose exclu- sively. What is striking, though, is how close they are to the originals in terms of their outlines. Flaxman might increasingly pick out the figurai part of the compositions that he studies, but it is ultimately the formal values of these original figure compositions that determined his choice of medium and technique. Thus the antiquarian interest in a truthful representation of the underlying models appears as the most constant feature of Flaxman's drawings after antique and post-antique sculpture. 42</page><page sequence="51">JOHN FLAXMAN'S DRAWINGS Acknowledgements I would like to thank the Yale Center for British Art for their support through a one-month Visiting Fellowship in July 2007 to work on Flaxman's journey to Italy and the Yale Sketchbook in particular.

A visit to Florence and Siena is documented for February 1791 (Mrs Flaxman 1791-94). In summer 1794, having left Rome for good, the Flaxmans stayed in Florence for another five weeks before transferring themselves for six weeks to Carrara and then embarking on their return journey to Britain, where they arrived in November 1794; Irwin 1979, p. 53. For the stay in Carrara, see the MS letters by Flaxman to Mr J. Clark, dated Carrara, 22 July 1794, that implies an arrival at Carrara in the middle of July (Yale University, Beinecke Library, Osborn Files, Folder 5274), and to Charles Macintosh, Glasgow, dated 7 January 1813, where he refers to his six-week stay in 1794 (Osborne Files, Folder 5282).

See, for example, his dismissive remarks on Marco d'Agrate's St. Bartholomew.

E. Wright Half in his Rome parents a year from about into the his his beginning recent grand activities, tour, of that on having year: 2 April initially 1788, Flaxman told them wrote that he somewhat would be wearily working to his parents about his recent activities, having initially told them that he would be working in Rome from the beginning of that year: . . . the people where I lodged cheated me abominably, and the person with whom I was treating for the study wanted one to take it for 3 years certain, without giving me permission to make one of the windows large enough to see my work by ... &amp; as a gentleman was going to Naples who offered to take us in his carriage, I thought I should do better to see all I had to see before I settled to my studies . . -1 The passage touches on much of the ground this essay will cover: the happenstance nature of tourism, and its occasional disappointments; the obligation to and pre-existing knowledge of a list of works one 'had to see'; and the sense of a distinction between Flaxman' s 'studies' (his working life) in Rome and the more general concerns of the Grand Tourist elsewhere. David Irwin has characterized the journals that Flaxman made during the early, itinerant part of his tour from Brighton to Italy (BL, FitzwiUiam and UCL Journals) as containing largely 'historical studies', which were soon abandoned in favour of his sketchbooks made at Rome and elsewhere (Y ale Sketchbook, V&amp;A Sketchbooks 2790 and E 442- 193 7). 2 He furthermore finds Flaxman's drawings after the antique 'fairly predictable, including many examples that one would expect to find', and indeed Flaxman's interest in the antique has typically excited less comment than his unusual enthu- siasm for early Italian art. Yet in Rome in July 1788, Flaxman enthusiastically wrote to William Hayley that he had on his travels 'sought out the works of ancient artists everywhere',3 and his devotion to the classical model throughout his career makes it worthwhile to examine these en- counters with actual works of ancient art. In this regard, the early journals offer an immediate and intriguing insight into his taste for a range of objects, separate to the more practical, analytical and focused studies in the working sketchbooks, to which he returned throughout his time in Italy.4 This essay will largely focus on Flaxman's visits to Florence (FitzwiUiam Journal), where he saw one of the most renowned collections of classical marbles in the world at the Uffizi,5 and, particularly, to Naples (UCL Journal), where the miscellany of ancient objects recovered from the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii included bronze and marble sculptures, wall-paintings, examples of the decorative arts, everyday household objects and diverse architectural remains.6 Flaxman's journals testify to a widespread interest in all aspects of his journey, his summary tone and general content even resembling a traveller's guidebook in places, especially as he often lists museum objects by room. His dutiful list of foodstuffs, material fragments and other archaeo- logical ephemera at the Portici palace at Naples, for instance, could be from any visitor's account of the displays, and one feels sure that he did not intend to pursue further study of such objects (UCL Journal, f. i8r).7 Some of the comments highlight a broad antiquarian interest in classical culture, such as his references at Portici to the ongoing efforts to decipher the Herculaneum papyri, or to the discovery of ancient window glass (UCL Journal, ff. 14V- i5r, i7r). He also seems to have been happy to omit detailed descriptions of many of the more portable antiquities such as 47</page><page sequence="55">A. E. WRIGHT vases, gems and coins, other examples of which he would have readily been able to access in the collections of art colleges, friends and patrons such as Edward Knight, to whose coin and medal collection Flaxman refers at UCL Journal, ff. 27r. His entire entry on the Chamber of Gems at the Uffizi, for instance, records that these are 'numerous &amp; valuable, amongst others a head of Ti- berius in Turquoise Stone 3 Inches long' (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 9r). Flaxman's brevity is partially explained by foreknowledge, the journals containing several references to casts in London, and to a variety of publications on which he evidendy relied for the details he did not include himself, including an unspecified guide to Paris; Lalande's Voyage en Italie; Perrier's popular guides to Roman statues and bas-reliefs; the prestigious Antichità di Ercolano esposte series; and a series of prints of decorative antique objects etched by Saint-Non after Hubert Robert (e.g. BL Journal, ff. 9v, 15V; Fitzwilliam Journal, ff. 8r, 8v, 9v; UCL Journal, ff. i5r, i8r, 25r).8 He demonstrates a consistendy learned (if also practical) approach to the construction and original appearance of ancient objects, especially sculpture, often referring to repairs and copies: a notable example is his detailed description of one of the most renowned antique marbles, the Venus de' Medid (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 5r).9 Several comments show a historical interest in the develop- ment of sculptural style, such as his early interest at the Uffizi in Etruscan bronze statuettes (later the subject of significant sketches and of his Lectures, see V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 93), and his note of a set of marble imperial busts 'very useful as well for the likeness as for to shew the Style of Sculpture in the different ages' (Fitzwilliam Journal, ff. 7v-8r). In the same gallery, 'a fine Statue of an Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpent nearly the same as I have seen on a Greek coin' shows Flaxman as ever searching for Greek influence (ibid., f. 8v). Despite Flaxman's desire to apply and display his learning, he thought it just as important, if not more, to record his personal aesthetic reactions, although often in a rather summary fashion.10 He orders objects under aesthetic categories such as 'beautiful', 'fine', 'natural', 'sublime', 'noble', 'delicate', 'hard', 'grand' and 'simple', ranging from the idealized 'beautiful Nature' of the Niobe group to the 'bea[u]tiful, grand &amp; simple' bronze Peplophores (or IVater- Carriers) at Portici, which represented a severe, archaic and stylized type (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 6r; UCL Journal, ff. 141"- I5r).n Of all the categories, it is striking how often Flaxman describes antique works in relation to 'nature', and that he particularly responds to vitalistic aspects of the most famous sculptures, as opposed to the stillness of marble 'marked by no vein, moved by no nerve' that was sought by Winckelmann and Canova.12 Flaxman's attention to the 'very tendinous Muscles characteristic of Celerity' of the bronze Drunken Faun at Portici (UCL Journal, f. I9r) marks the opposite of Winckelmann's ideal. He furthermore characterizes this Faun as representing 'nature' without 'affectation of Style' in almost exacdy the same phrasing as his description of the Niobe group, an unusual connection that seems to derive from his opinion that the Niobe women represented 'Nature . . . copied with so much spirit judgement &amp; truth of anatomy . . . the naked parts seem capable of Motion' (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 6r-v; UCL Journal, f. I9r). Some of Flaxman's most personal passages, on the renowned Tribuna sculptures of the Venus de' Medid and the Boxers, focus on marble 'of so tender a tint &amp; transparent, the appearance of the flesh so soft . . . seems so much the in motion', and which 'has greatly the appearance of flesh' (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 5r-v). It would be misleading, however, to think that truth to nature was sufficient, as Flaxman's praise of the Drunken Faun, one of the most celebrated sculptures at Portici at this time, bears a hint of disparagement: 'a perfect copy of the nature it is intended to represent ' (UCL Journal, f. I9r; my emphasis). Fauns, of course, do not belong to the highest order of beauty, and their animalistic 48</page><page sequence="56">flaxman's taste for the antique characteristics perhaps admit praise in much the same way as Flaxman admired the accuracy of the animal statues at the Vatican, and the 'beautiful' and 'natural' horse of the younger Equestrian Balbus at Portici (ibid., f. 22r).13 A reference to a pair of wresders or runners 'copied from common nature', which were found at the same Herculanean villa as the Drunken Faun, bears a similar insinuation, despite the boyish vitality which, Barré points out, testifies to ancient admiration of a specifically adolescent beauty (ibid., f. 2or).14 Lalande, whom Flaxman had read, thought the runners very beautiful,15 but it is clear that Flaxman's appreciation of the naturalistic bronzes could not compete with his pre-existing belief in the superiority of idealized beauty. Unlike in Florence and Rome, however, when Flaxman visited Naples in 1788 there were few large marbles other than the Equestrian Balbi in the Portici collections.16 The journal made in Naples (UCL Journal) is particularly interesting for the present survey because it covers a wide range of ancient objects other than celebrated fine art pieces, and, unlike Flaxman's other Italian journals and sketchbooks, it only includes classical material, apart from a series of classicizing drapery stud- ies (Cat. nos. 2-12, 16). 17 Flaxman's visit to Naples also bears particular witness to his circumscribed experiences as a tourist: visitors to the Portici palace were not allowed to make notes or sketch in the galleries,18 with the result that he only seems to have drawn one museum object (a helmet, Cat. nos. 14, 15), and the exclusive focus on classical material seems to have been accidental. Flaxman's brief note of the Capodimonte gallery's 'fine' collection of modern paintings is explained by his wife's journal entry that 'Many of these things were very fine and deserv'd a second visit - but - fever prevented it'.19 In an essay on the famous Herculanean papyri, discovered in the 1750s and afterwards housed at Portici (ff. I4v-i5r, i7r), James Porter describes contemporary reluctance to accommodate their perceived deficiencies within an entrenched, idealized model of classical antiquity.20 The difficulty in reconciling idealized 'classical' values with the actual physical remains of antique culture is a useful point when considering Flaxman's responses to the miscellany of antique works he records in the UCL Journal. The ancient wall-paintings taken from Herculaneum and Pompeii and displayed at Portici were famously controversial in this regard,21 great curiosities for their rarity, but rather a disappointment compared to the sculptures of the same period of antiquity; it was largely accepted that the works were probably provincial copies of more famous models, much as Flaxman writes at f. 24r.22 Flaxman's section headed 'Paintings' (ff. 23r-2ór) owes a clear debt to previous commentators such as Cochin, Winckelmann and the authors of the Antichità di Ercolano esposte series, echoing many of the familiar criticisms.23 Yet Irwin's suggestion that Flaxman abruptly spurned 'paintings that were to influence Ingres, and later probably Picasso' is unfair.24 Flaxman gives a comparatively long account of the paintings, and even attempts to classify them in '5 orders . . . with respect to merit' (f. 23r), acknowledging that some of the smaller and supposedly more insignificant pieces were more appealing and technically accomplished than the large-scale 'historical' subjects such as the Hercules and Telephus.25 He clearly engages with some of the works, and in fact some of his more positive criticism is expressed in comparable terms to his section on early Italian 'primitive' paintings at Florence, even though he was more moved by the latter. His praise of the 'purity of composition' in ancient linear paintings on marble, and the 'excellence' of the 'simple, grand &amp; beautiful' compositions of the megalographic pieces, echoes descriptions of Gaddi's 'simple &amp; grand' or 'simple strikingly beautiful &amp; affecting' compositions (f. 24r; Fitzwilliam Journal, f. i8r- v). He also responds positively to the emotional, almost sublime aspects of the religious subjects in two ancient wall-paintings of the worship of Isis (ff. 24r- 25r), noting the 49</page><page sequence="57">A. E. WRIGHT 'exceedingly grand' effect of unscientific perspective in 'the long ranges of figures' and demon- strating an instinctive feeling, very early in his Tour, for the expressive appeal of works pre-dating the artistic developments of the Renaissance. He genuinely delights in the much-admired series of small, decorative flying and dancing figures, according them some of his highest categories of praise for any form of art, as 'most beautiful &amp; delicate . . . exactly representative of the momentary beau- tiful accidents of nature' (f. 25r). The passage is comparable to that on Vasari's portraits at the Uffizi, in which Flaxman argues for the superior abilities of historical painters, because 'the man who can go no farther [than] the likeness is unable well to show represent any of the contours or accidents of the human figure' (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. çv) - clearly showing the degree to which hè had accepted such small and decorative pieces as significant works of ancient art. He was also particu- larly impressed by the wall-paintings from the so-called Tomb of the Warrior at Nola, which he saw at Capodimonte, writing that they displayed 'so much of the spirit of nature both in the outline &amp; action that they really seem as if they had been traced from living figures' (ff. 2ór-27r). Crucially, he recognizes the works as 'Ancient Etruscan Paintings' and therefore made by the same Greek communities as were held to be responsible for red-figure vase paintings. He was, perhaps, aware of Sir William Hamilton's similar conclusion on their excavation in 1778. 26 The painting Flaxman most liked was an 'extremely natural' Marsyas and Olympus, which he refers to as 'a man sitting &amp; teaching a lad to play on 2 pipes', noting that it had been published (ff. 25r-2ór); presumably, this was in the Antichità di Ercolano esposte (Fig. i).27 It is interesting that he was so attracted to a relatively obscure and small piece, which was unremarked by other commentators. Significantly, the piece is very damaged, and what remains of the faun is entirely human, even lacking the animalistic ears present in other versions; perhaps this heightened Flaxman's sense of 'natural' simplicity, and the 'truth' of the design.28 It is also much smaller than the other 'historical' subjects, and more delicate. Despite the damaged area, the Antichità engraving emphasizes the decorative and linear qualities of the design, bringing it closer to Flaxman's own drawing style. The derivation of ancient wall-paintings from statue and bas-relief compositions was well known, and had been used to criticize the coldness and stiffness of some of the groupings.29 For Flaxman, the more refined and attenuated qualities of the Marsyas and Olympus were a stylistic advantage, sympathetic to his own classically-influenced pictorial style, something which is also evident in his drawings of wall-paintings in the UCL journal (Cat. nos. 34-36, 38). A domestic scene from 'a wall in Pompeia' (Cat. no. 38) has a typically classical composition, but includes a winsome child more characteristic of eighteenth-century than ancient sentiment; overall, the drawing exemplifies the decorous sweetness of Flaxman's contemporary family groups. The modern inflection is clear when compared with the study that precedes it, a faithfully rendered gem with a bas-relief of a bacchante, satyr and child that might also be considered as approaching a 'family' group (Cat. no. 37). More subtly, the three drawings of small flying female figures taken from wall-paintings of whirling bacchantes (Cat. nos. 34-36) convey instead a chaste sombreness, their gestures frozen and solemn (rather as in Winckelmann's influential analysis of the Niobe group),30 in a seeming prototype of the Christian flying female figures later employed on Flaxman's tomb sculptures.31 Aside from its sculptures and wall-paintings, Portici was famous for its unparalleled array of archaeological finds, including numerous highly ornamented examples of the decorative arts remarkable for their beauty and skill of workmanship. Flaxman later displayed something of an antipathy to such objects in his lecture on Drapery, writing that the latter 'will not bear neglect, 50</page><page sequence="58">flaxman's taste for the antique Fig. I C.

(Copyright of the Trustees of the British Museum) or slight, like articles of furniture or back-ground, which, as they are utterly separated from the pathos of sublime composition, can scarcely deserve any share of [the student's] attention'.32 It is also evident that although archaeologically accurate candelabra, tripods, chairs and other items of ancient furniture contribute much to the elegantly domestic tone of his Odyssey illustrations, on which he was to embark only a few years after this first visit to Naples, he keeps their occurrence in his compositions to a minimum.33 Yet, faced with the actual objects, Flaxman reveals an open- minded fascination with the skill and workmanship of all sorts of decorative items, and particu- larly with modelling and other three-dimensional techniques. He mentions many objects renowned for their fine and elegant craftsmanship, such as the Tazza Farnese at Capodimonte, one of the larg- est cameos in existence, and a bronze statuette of Alexander and Bucephalus that had been highly praised by Winckelmann (ff. 2ór, 2or). In a somewhat rushed account, he repeatedly notes diverse details of finishing, ornamentation and manufacture, such as the 'chasing and inlaying' of designs into a lectisternum, candelabra, and bucklers; armour and fibulae decorated with incised patterns 51</page><page sequence="59">A. E. WRIGHT and bas-reliefs; two silver calathi (which he oddly calls 'altars') decorated with 'very fine' figures in relief; a pictorial mosaic 'so finely cut no delicasy [sic] of effect was lost'; a bust 'extraordinary for having the locks of hair made in thin narrow plates of metal twisted &amp; soldered to the head'; and two terracotta 'rough models' of actors, 'about 5 feet high each in one piece' (ff. I5r, i8r, 20r, 2ir, 2ór). The silver calathi are a reminder of Flaxman's own career in the decorative arts, as they are very similar types to the models he would use for his Theocritus Cup (1812), a design for silverware based on a description from ancient Greek literature.34 The number of different objects decorated with bas-relief demonstrates Flaxman's wide-ranging interest in the technical possibilities of this medium, which was to occupy so much of his working life. More than this, decorative bas-reliefs were potential sources of compositions, in much the same way that Flaxman was inspired by the bas-relief groups on sarcophagi and gems - though his short stay in Naples and the inability to sketch in the museum necessarily limited the influence of these pieces. It is significant that the only Portici object he manages to sketch in the journal is a gladiatorial helmet decorated with relief figures of the destruction of Troy (Cat. nos. 14, 15), an important composition for its connection with Homer. The note of a 'fine Silver bas-releif [sic] of the death of Cleopatra . . . engraved in Roberts's Antique Ornament' (f. i8r) - actually a mirror back depicting the death of Phaedra - is also intriguing, as it suggests he may have owned or had access to the Saint-Non print after Hubert Robert which depicts the object (Fig. 2); it bears a slight resemblance to Flaxman's design of Andromache fainting from the Iliad illustrations, and could perhaps be a source for the composition.35 The affecting deathbed scene would have been of obvious appeal to Flaxman, while the less decorous items in the Saint-Non plate are a useful reminder of his selective vision at Portici! The domestic and other decorative obj ects at Portici provided examples of high-quality figura- tive modelling of all sorts. Flaxman's attention to two particular bronze 'military vases' is entirely concerned with 'the handles formed of Soldiers laying their Shields on each other' (ff. 2or, 2ir), and there are drawings of equivalent warrior figures from bronze handles and statuettes at the Uffizi (V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, pp. 109, 113, 115) - although one should remember the slighdy disparaging tone in the comment on Cellini's bronze Perseus , only a few months before his journey to Naples: 'it is wonderful so fine a group of that size should be the work of a Man whose whole employment was chasing little figures on plates and Ewers' (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 3r).36 Winckel- mann had argued, of 'ancient tools, and particularly vases', that '[a]n imitation of their taste could . . . lead us away from ornate to natural decorations',37 a sentiment in which Flaxman probably shared, as when he notes 'Candelabrae of the most exquisite finishing . . . many of them represent- ing canes &amp; vegetables rising joint out of joint' (f. 2ir). He may have been thinking of contempo- rary theories about the primeval origin of architecture and decoration in natural forms such as trees.38 There is even a suggestion in the UCL Journal that Flaxman may have been partly interested in the armour because of its naturalistic (in this context, anatomical) ornamentation, as when he comments on greaves with designs 'wrought into the muscles &amp;c of the legs' (f. I7r). It may be significant that he refers in this section to a piece of armour in the British Museum, an andromorphic cuirass once in Sir William Hamilton's collection.39 This 'thorax' clearly had a strong hold on his imagination, as it appears in manuscript notes towards his Lectures, and in a small, undated sketchbook of miscellaneous classical studies (now also held in the British Museum); perhaps he saw this piece not only as evidence of naturalistic, simple armour styles, but also literally as archaeological evidence of ancient bodies, which had been idealized in arguments by 52</page><page sequence="60">flaxman's taste for the antique Fig. 2 J.

(Copyright of the Trustees of the British Museum) 53</page><page sequence="61">A. E. WRIGHT Winckelmann.40 There was one strange object at Portici that certainly appealed to him in this regard, a piece of hardened ash that had formed round the body of a young Pompeian woman who died after the eruption of Vesuvius, and of which he gives a detailed description (f. 2ir): . . . the mould is about the colour &amp; consistence of rotten stone, the impression is exact the drapery remains in folds it is a fine open linnen [sic] Sc the folds in fineness exactly resemble that on the antique statues . . . Flaxman's reaction to this mould was not unusual (see UCL Journal, note 57), but one notes the significance of his interest in its 'drapery', a subject that was always of the utmost importance to him. Having been transmuted into 'rotten stone', the mould of the woman's body not only testified to the accurate representation of the body and its drapery in classical sculpture, it was itself like an 'antique statue', and could be used analogously, to demonstrate to modern artists how most beau- tifully to represent and reveal the body. In his lecture on Drapery , originally given at the Royal Academy in the early 1810s, Flaxman writes: . . .concerning the finer and more transparent draperies used by the ancients, their texture, and consequently their folds, strongly resemble our calico muslin, and are peculiar to the more elegant and delicate female characters of Grecian sculpture . . . The more transparent of these draperies leave the forms and oudine of the person . . . perfectly intelligible . . . the existence of the veil is only understood by groups of small folds collected in the hollows between the body and limbs . . .41 The similarity of the passage to that from the UCL Journal may indicate that he had remembered the example of the Pompeian victim. While on the subject of moulds, a passing reference to two ephemeral and generally unnoticed parts of the collection shows a more personal side to Flaxman's interest in ancient manufacture. The note of 'Antique moulds of Plaister [sic] Sc clay for producing various ornaments of Terra Cotta' and 'various faces of plaister [sic] the size of Nature to form masks upon for the Theatre' (f. I5r) indicates craftsmen's matrices and models. These will have appealed to a professional sculp- tor and modeller, and no doubt also recalled his father's work as a plaster cast and model maker. Furthermore, the matrices he describes were typical of Greek production, which may have been an additional source of interest.42 The UCL Journal also contains several architectural drawings made at the archaeological sites of Pompeii, Pozzuoli and, apparently, Paestum (Cat. nos. 1, 17-22, 24-31), which by this time were almost obligatory parts of the southern Grand Tour.43 At first glance the drawings might suggest a rather unoriginal project; Flaxman referred to the Pompeian sketches as studies 'from some of the principal buildings at Pompeia',44 and there is a distinct resemblance in some sheets to contem- porary architectural publications, such as the Abbé de Saint-Non's Voyage Pittoresque ou description des royaumes de Naples et de Sicile (Paris, 1781-86). Several are diagrammatic, not only the sparse (and rather crude) plan of the Large Theatre area (Cat. no. 26), but also the two studies each of the tomb of the Istacidii and the Temple of Isis (Cat. nos. 22, 24, 29-30), which present various aspects of the structures in an analytical manner, including elevations, reconstructions, details, alternative views, a numbered view with a key, and, in the case of the tomb of the Istacidii, a plan which he may have taken from Saint-Non.45 It is hard to see Flaxman considering these views as useful sources for later compositions, giving the impression that he may have chosen to record them from a sense of duty or historical study, and from a didactic impetus to represent the curiosities of the 54</page><page sequence="62">flaxman's taste for the antique destroyed city to friends and family.46 There are, however, many other aspects of the drawings that reward further study. A striking aspect of the drawings is that in many of them the buildings are reconstructed. The most remarkable is a wash drawing that appears to be of the Garland Tomb (Figs. 3 &amp; 4). A simple sloping roof has been added, and the restoration of the exterior of the tomb has altered its propor- tions and decoration, transposing the garland motif from the sides to the façade, and even smoothed over its rough, brick-and-plaster surface, perhaps representing the stucco which was used on some of the tombs. The actual appearance of the tomb, if indeed it is the Garland Tomb, has been almost completely obscured. Flaxman, typically, was attracted to the idea of the original classical design, avoiding the corresponding contemporary tendency towards the emotional and picturesque qualities of ruins, as seen in Piranesi's views.47 He even sketches an almost entire reconstruction (admittedly in a partially ruined state) of the rotunda in the so-called Temple of Jupiter Serapis at Pozzuoli, probably with the aid of a print Nancy Flaxman mentions in her diary, rather than recording the actual base-level remains (Cat. no. 31). Later, in an intriguing manuscript essay on Homer dated 11 June 1799, 48 Flaxman extended his archaeological and idealistic interpretation of the Pompeian remains to co-opt a Roman, republican-era villa, the so-called Villa of Diomedes on the Street of Tombs,49 as 'some illustration of Homer's description' of 'the Plans of Priam's &amp; Fig. 3 The Garland Tomb, Pompeii. (Copyright of the author) Fig. 4 Reconstruction of a tomb at Pompeii. UCL Journal, f. 29r. 55</page><page sequence="63">A. E. WRIGHT Alcinous's Palaces or Houses'. Attaching a carefully copied plan of the villa (without referring to it by name) and a detail of a Doric portico 'formed of wooden columns with the Caps rudely Cut', he argues that its arrangement, its plain, undecorated walls and the early Doric style prove the accuracy of Homer's descriptions, and demonstrate his importance as a source for understanding the 'Arts of Design' in early Greece.50 In the same essay and in similarly reconstructive mode, he also suggests that the marble Jennings Dog,51 familiar to him before Italy, and which he knew to have existed in several copies from two further versions at the Uffizi (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. çv), might therefore have functioned in a similar way to the multiple statues of dogs made by Vulcan to guard Alcinous' house, in the seventh book of the Odyssey . In letters describing his travels in southern Italy, Flaxman responded most eagerly in architectural terms to the famed fifth- and sixth-century bc Doric temples at Paestum, writing that 'my mind was filled with the sublime of architecture', and, 'the simple greatness of their effect . . . elevated &amp; delighted my mind more than all the other architecture I have seen in Italy, which have been raised under the auspices of Roman taste &amp; perfected in the elegance of Imperial corruption'.52 This has rightly been seen as a significant 'confirmation of his love of elemental forms'53 in line with his enthusiasm for Homer and fifth-century Greek vases. However, as Anna Ottani Cavina has pointed out regarding artists' responses to the temples in the late eighteenth century, 'rather than a revelation, this merely confirmed what artists already knew, since the remote magnificence of the Doric style had determined their choice long before a personal contact'.54 The temples would have been familiar to Flaxman as exemplars of primitive and pure architecture from previous publications, such as Thomas Major's The Ruins of Paestum, otherwise Posidonia, in Magna Graecia (London, 1768). As Cavina continues, by the time Flaxman visited Italy, 'he had already developed in the direction of synthesis and abstraction'. She argues that the radical, abstracting influence of Paestum's 'primeval geometry' can be seen most clearly in Flaxman's drapery studies, in some of which the folded material 'suggests the fluted shaft of a Doric column, without the slightest hint of artificiality'. Indeed, the drapery studies in the UCL Journal include several such examples, in which models are draped in the plain, classicizing cloak later characterized in the Lectures as '[o]f all garments . . . the simplest ... It belongs to the most grave and dignified characters';55 see particularly Cat. nos. 2, 5 and 10. On what stands for the title-page of the journal (Cat. no. 1), there is even a Vitruvian slant to the combination of faint sketches of a classicized figure and Doric architecture, possibly a Paestan temple. While there is not much to connect the dignified UCL Journal drapery studies securely to the Neapolitan visit of 1788, if they do represent southern Italians it is the more suggestive of Flaxman's interpretative and classicizing vision: sharing in common ethnographic stereotypes which held the Neapolitans to be short, rough and lazy, the Flaxmans were 'by no means delighted either with the City or People'.56 Flaxman's actual drawings of Paestum, however, hardly convey his protestations of the sublime: a tiny sketch in a letter to Romney shows a distant temple nestled in the landscape,57 and a possible further outline in the UCL Journal (Cat. no. 1) is indistinct. Of greater significance is a sketch of two refined and sober Doric capitals (Cat. no. 25), with its focus on the ornamentation of the temples: 'the small members done with so much feeling and delicacy'.58 In the UCL Journal, Flaxman's also sketches details of Corinthian and Ionic capitals (Cat. nos. 17, 25, 27, 28), a marble pulvinus (Cat. no. 24), terracotta antefixes, a sima and architectural masks (Cat. nos. 24, 27, 29), as well as noticing decorative elements such as the stucco figures on the purgatorium in the Temple of Isis (Cat. no. 30); see also BL Journal, Cat. no. 11, of the Porte d'Arroux at Autun. Many of the 56</page><page sequence="64">flaxman's taste for the antique features drawn by Flaxman are presented in a fanciful arrangement on the first plate to Mazois' Les Ruines de Pompei (Paris, 1824), 59 testifying to their continuing status as curiosities and symbols of Pompeii (Fig. 5). Ironically, Flaxman's drawings seem to contradict his own dismissal of the 'elegance of Imperial corruption'. He was clearly genuinely interested in architectural ornament and the decorative elegance of ancient culture, revealing an unexpected alignment of taste with contemporary architectural figures such as his friend Sir John Soane, and Thomas Hope and Charles Percier, with both of whom he had dealings in Italy.60 Partly this was due to historical enquiry in his own profession of sculpture and modelling - compare V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 42r, and UCL Journal, Cat. no. 27 - but he is likely also to have been concerned with the improvement of taste through imitation of antique models, as with the decorative objects he saw at Portici. In Florence, he includes the following revealing passage on Arnolfo di Cambio (here called Arnolfo di Lapo), the architect of the Duomo: he has introduced ornaments taken from fragments of Greek, Etruscan &amp; Roman remains ... he has also carved the Mouldings with Egg &amp; tongue &amp; leaves with different numbers of points like those on the best Sarcophagi &amp;c of Antiquity with Arabesque friezes in a fine taste, these decorations shew the opportunities &amp; judgment this Artist possessed were very superior to his cotempories Northward . . . the pure Antique Greek ornaments on the Mouldings, &amp; the Roman ornaments on the Friezes give it a most beautiful effect in the parts. (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. i6r-v)61 This seems to explain his interest in the Ionic capitals from the Large Theatre at Pompeii, which, alongside similar models noted for their good 'Greek' taste, were admired by other visitors (Cat. nos. 27, 28). In fact, Flaxman not only draws sympathetic sketches of ornamented architecture, such as the Corinthian decorations to the Temple of Isis at Pompeii (Cat. nos. 17, 29-30), or the Temple of the Sibyl at Tivoli (Y ale Sketchbook, f. 78r), but his treatment of the buildings and monuments at Pompeii itself ornamentalizes the ruins. Many visitors noted the smallness of Pompeian buildings and the occasional coarseness of the architectural decoration, which often consisted of painted stucco over brick, and travellers' ambivalent feelings towards the remains also encompassed the removal of contextual furnishings to Portici, and the perceived immorality of pagan life.62 Flaxman's response to the non-ideal architectural remains is not merely a record, but transforms what he saw into elegant, isolated instances of classical design. The grand and impressive schola (bench tomb) of Aulus Veius (Cat. no. 21), in addition to the starkly elegant shape that clearly appealed to Flaxman, has been transformed into smooth and continuous stone and contrasts vividly with the tufa blocks of the road from which it is in fact also made; he also pays particular attention to the ornamental carved bench-ends. Flaxman's simple sketch of the tomb of Marcus Cerrinius Restitutus (Cat. no. 18) removes its surface decoration (the paintings on the inside walls) and the surrounding context of the Street of Tombs, focusing attention on the pared-down symmetry of the structure, and the single statue inside (his own invention, this had been removed): the quiet, reflective tone strengthens the appearance of a 'chappie', as he thought this private tomb. The sketches in the UCL Journal, then, are not quite the simple records they seem, though no doubt some of the discrepancies were caused by working up the graphite drawings away from the site, adding pen, ink and wash.63 The example of the tomb of Restitutus shows how Flaxman's drawings not only present a visually orderly and delicate Pompeii, but also a more spiritually respectable city, appropriate to his own moral sensibilities; compare the vertiginous and sinister 57</page><page sequence="65">A.

Some of the stranger ephemera at Portici show him in an oddly personal light, such as the plaster matrices that related to his own profession, and the mould of a dead body, which reveals the extent of the gende sculptor's somewhat callous obsession with drapery. Also in the UCL Journal, Flaxman's inter- pretative sketches from Pompeii hint at the process of accommodating and adapting pagan archi- tecture and decorative wall-paintings that fell outside his notions of ideal art, demonstrating a quite different tourist experience from the anticipated delights of the Tribuna, or the discovery of 'magnificent' narrative compositions in sarcophagi.66 Taken as a coherent object in its own right, the UCL Journal, rather than a source of compositions and models like the sketchbooks, is a telling and early instance of the selection and transformation of classical art which came to characterize Flaxman's own art, allowing him to use beautiful but pagan antique objects for Christian, moral and sentimental purposes.

JOURNAL AND SKETCHBOOK USED BY JOHN FLAXMAN ON HIS JOURNEY TO ITALY COVERING THE FIRST PART OF THE ITINERARY FROM BRIGHTON TO BOLOGNA, DATED 1787 (BRITISH LIBRARY) Transcribed, edited and catalogued by Eckart Marchand Editor's Note The journal consists of forty original folios in addition to the modern cover and two modern pages at front and at back. It measures approximately 15.3 x 18.9 cm including the modern cover; the pages have never been cut down and measure approximately 14.3 x 18 cm. The original cover does not survive. In 1919, prior to the rebinding, the original folios were numbered. This is recorded by a note, presumably written into the original back cover and later cut out and glued into the modern back cover: 40 ff May îçiç SH/ Examined by AJ.W. The modern cover is inscribed: Flaxman Papers. Vol. VII. J. Flaxman's Journal 1787 .; the spine: BRIT.MUS. ADDITIONAL MS 39,786. The original book has been completed in pen, pencil and grey wash. The journal includes notes and sketches from Flaxman's journey through France and northern Italy,, ending in Bologna. Starting from the front [f. 2r] the volume served as a travel diary, with small sketches inserted into the text. Here Flaxman used both the rectos and the versos. Simultaneously, and starting from the back, the volume functioned also as a sketchbook. In this section Flaxman used mosdy, but not exclusively, the versos. Eventually, Flaxman's diary account would run out of space at the bottom of f. 2óv. Flaxman passed over f. 2jr and f. 27V as this folio was already used for the last of the full-page drawings, and added the final lines of the diary on f. 28r and f. 28v, writing partly over an uncompleted graphite sketch on f. 28v. Flaxman introduced his own page numbering which is not fully systematic and runs both from the front to the back, and from the back to the front, relating to the dual function of the book. There are tables of contents [f. 39V and f. 4or] that relate to Flaxman's page numbers, and other notes at the beginning and end of the book. Editorial Conventions Flaxman's spelling, capitalization and punctuation have been transcribed as seen, with editorial insertions marked by square brackets, e.g. [.]. [sic] indicates an originally misspelled word, repeated word, etc. Triangular brackets have been used to indicate either an illegible passage, or a word that can only be guessed, e.g. &lt;...&gt;. Bold letters have been used where Flaxman used large letters as headings. Raised script has been used where Flaxman adds a raised word or passage. Single or double strikethroughs have been used as they appear in the journal; however, when Flaxman uses more than two strikethroughs a single one is used, followed by the actual number in square brackets. Occasionally Flaxman writes keywords as headings in larger script into the margine of the text where they function as headings; these are indicated with bold script. A page break is indicated as //[f. ir], with Flaxman's own numbering, where it exists, indicated by a bold number, e.g. I. The folio num- bering follows the one introduced in 1919 and counts only the original pages of the volume. Some drawings in the journal are not annotated and are therefore only indicated in the transcript by plate number and descrip- tive title. It has been possible to include in the transcript some small figures which Flaxman drew within his main text. The full-page drawings of the sketchbook part are discussed in the catalogue that follows the tran- script. In the transcript they are indicated with a descriptive title in bold capitals, a catalogue number and a plate number, e.g. AFTER GIOVANNI PIETRO LASAGNA, GLORY OF THE ANGELS (Cat. no. 14, 61</page><page sequence="69">flaxman: british library journal Fig. 14). The catalogue is organized in chronological order, proceeding, like the sketchbook part, from the back of the volume towards the front.

As mentioned in the editor's note, the drawings in the sketchbook part of this volume were completed from back to front. The present drawing is an exception to this rule. It appears upside-down on the last page of the volume, but it is unlikely to date from the very beginning of the journey. Having left the page originally empty, Flaxman may have returned to it at a later stage when he was looking for a suitable space for this image. The portrait of Louis XVI is most likely based on a coin or medal of the French king. Flaxman had seen the king while he was visiting Versailles, and this may well have been a motive for him to copy his portrait. Later, in Italy, he may also have seen one of the posthumous medals of the monarch (Maumené and d'Harcourt 1928-32, il (1932), pp. 453-94 (for portraits of the monarch); for posthumous medals see, for example, Sotheby's Florence, 8 April 1974, lot 7 (dated 1793)). The journal of the travel through France would have been an obvious place for such a sketch. Apart from personal reasons, Flaxman may also have drawn it with future portrait commissions in mind. In Rome, Flaxman modelled for Wedgwood a portrait of Victor Amadeus III, King of Sardinia and Duke of Savoy based on a miniature in a snuffbox (Y ale Sketchbook, f. 8or; Irwin 1979, p. 28).

(f. 38v) (Fig. 3) after ancient relief fragment Relief fragment with A Bearded Man Seated in Profile to Right in an outdoor setting Graphite, pen and ink, and wash A relief fragment is positioned, standing upright, in a green setting with grass and plants growing around it. It is apparently inserted into the ground and broken on either side. A male nude is shown seated on the ground in profile to the right, the chin is resting in the right hand, the left hand grasping what might be the pommel of a sword. Behind the man's back appears a foreshortened shield, before him what may be a branch of reed. Neither the relief nor its subject matter have been identified. The work may have belonged to the decora- tions of the Duke of Bouillon's gardens at Evreux, where the Flaxmans stayed on their way through northern France. The collection has since been dispersed (see Cat. no. 4). See f. 39r. Chateau Navarre near Evreux, Temple of Love 4- (f- 37v) (Fig. 4) after ancient relief Love and Apathy striving for the palm Graphite, pen and ink, and wash (image turned 90o clockwise) Inscribed in graphite below: Love and Apathy striving for the palm On their route from Rouen to Paris the Flaxmans stayed for a week at the Duke of Bouillon's castle, Navarre, near Evreux (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 5r; Irwin 1979, pp. 30-31). The name of the castle went back to the marriage of Duke Philippe d'Evreux to Jeanne de Navarre, the gardens were designed by Lenôtre. After the French revolution the castle served as the residence for Napoleon's divorced wife, Josephine. It was later demolished, as were the buildings in the garden (Réau 1959, 11, p. 98). One of these was the circular Temple of Love, of which Flaxman made a number of drawings. The present study depicts a relief that was inserted above the entrance into the fabric of this temple. The relief predates the temple and was first recorded in 171 9 in another Bouillon residence, Saint Martin at Fig. 3 Folio 38V. Fig. 4 Folio 37V. 77</page><page sequence="85">flaxman: british library journal Pontoise. It survives in the Musée d'Evreux (Tervarent 1965, pp. 206-07). Tervarent (pp. 207-08) suggests that it might be an Italian Renaissance work based on an ancient Roman relief and mentions in this context such a relief in the Museo Nazionale at Naples. The theme of Eros and Anteros as a representation of love and mutual love is discussed in classical sources, including Pausanias's Description of Greece (vi, 23, 5), a text to which Flaxman would later refer in the V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-173 (p. 170). The images show two winged putti fighting for a palm branch that is decorated with a ribbon. In the relief the wings of Eros on the left are straight while those of Anteros on the right form volutes at the ends (Tervarent 1965, p. 206). Flaxman does not reproduce this minor, though significant, detail and his reading of the subject as Love and Apathy striving for the Palm seems to miss the point of the classical theme, namely, that love thrives on mutual love (Tervarent 1965, p. 206). In 1 79 1, Flaxman may have returned to this drawing when working on a commission for drawings after reliefs for Mr Edward Knight in London. The dispatch of the drawings to Mr Knight is noted in the Yale Sketchbook (f. 8or) where Flaxman lists a Contention of Eros &amp; Anteros among other subjects. 5. (f. 3óv) 3 (Fig- 5) after eighteenth-century architecture Front and rear elevation of the Temple of Love Graphite, pen and ink, and wash (image turned 90o anti-clockwise) Inscribed in ink on portico: EPOTI TI AN AAMATQPI Inscribed in graphite below: Temple dedicated to Love. Built in the manner of an ancient Ruin The eighteenth-century Temple of Love was one of the architectural embellishments of the gardens at Navarre. It was roughly modelled on the Pantheon as it consisted of a circular building with a temple front attached to it, here with columns in antis. Flaxman's front elevation appears to be a truthful rendering of the building, recording also the position of the relief of Eros and Anteros (Cat. no. 4). The rear elevation is more complex. It goes beyond the conventional limits of this genre and demonstrates Flaxman's interest in architecture. First Flaxman records the building's ruinous appearance with irregular, hesitant lines, including the niche and sculp- ture at the back of the building. Rather than showing only what is visible from the chosen viewpoint, Flaxman also renders the remaining parts of the curved walls near to the front of the building that would not be visible from behind. In the drawing these walls appear as if pulled outwards into the view of the beholder and, repre- sented like that, they could easily be misread as lateral extensions to the circular building. Finally, Flaxman indicates with bold lines what the completed building would look like. See Cat. no. 6 for the ground plan of the temple. 6.

The urn is surrounded and revealed by a partly draped curtain, possibly cast out of bronze. Above it appears a medallion with the profile portrait of the deceased. The monument has not been identified. Flaxman has recorded this funerary monument from the front and indicated the fall of light from the left. Paris, Church of Saint Germain L'Auxerrois 8. (f. 34V) 5 (Fig. 8) after unknown eighteenth-century sculptor The tomb of Comte Caylus Graphite This is an initial sketch of the tomb of the emminent antiquarian Anne-Claude-Philippe, Comte de Caylus (1692-1765). Flaxman may have abandoned the drawing, as the chosen close viewpoint obscured the inscrip- tion, proportions and overall composition of the monument. A second drawing (Cat. no. 10) was executed from a greater distance to avoid these problems. See this journal, if. iv and 33 V; Cat. no. 10. Near Paris, Abbey of St. Denis 9.

There are Caryatydes and on the pedestal are emblematical basreliefs these basreliefs are of the grandest gusto like M:1 Angelo, they border a little on the extravagant[.' The tomb for Francis I was commissioned in 1548 by Henry II from Philibert de l'Orme, and executed by Pierre Bontemps and Francois Marchand (Panofsky 1964, pl. 354; Erlande-Brandenburg 1976, 11, pls. 65-66 (and captions); Rouillard in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, xxvn, p. 547. It is a free-standing tomb with the sar- cophagus standing on top of a pedestal. Four pillars carry a baldachin, on top of which the deceased is kneeling in prayer with his family. The tomb for Henry II, mentioned by Flaxman in the inscription, was designed by Primaticcio, and executed in 1570-73 by Germain Pilon and Jacquio Ponce. It was situated in the Chapel of the Valois and transferred to its present place in 1719 (Panofsky 1964, pl. 353; Erlande-Brandenburg 1976, n, pis 68-69 (and captions); Rouillard in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxvn, p. 547. Pentimenti on the left of the right-hand side drawing betray a more ambitious approach in the underdrawing, not followed when fixing the design in pen and ink. Flaxman had apparently planned an oblique viewpoint from the side and the front. Only in the second, pen and ink, stage, Flaxman reduced the image to a strict side view. The elevation of one of the short sides of the sarcophagus on the left-hand side adds information that the general view cannot convey. Paris, Church of Saint Germain L9Auxerrois 10.

The underdrawing in graphite is particularly loose and Flaxman deviates from it, for example in the rendering of the vase on top of the sarcophagus. See this journal, f. iv with note i. Autun 11. (f. 32v) 6 (Fig- 11) after ancient Roman architecture The Porte d'Arroux at Autun Graphite, pen and ink and wash Inscribed in ink above: the architecture of pure proportions / the moulding all ornamental / Aniens [sic] / in the way to Lions [sic] from Paris / about 60 or 70 feet high Inscribed in ink below: Roman Fortifications in this place The two Roman city gates of Autun, the Porte ďArroux and the Porte de Saint- André, were both built under Augustus (27 bc- 14 ad; Lugli 1949, pp. 157 and 159; Blagg in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, 11, p. 840). One of their most striking features is the superposition of arcades of different size. Flaxman's drawing is a view of the Porte d'Arroux from the outside, but it deviates substantially from the appearance of the building. Most sig- nificantly, there are only two arches in the lower order of the gate that rise to the full height, while Flaxman depicts three, and the upper arches are narrower than in Flaxman's drawing. Thus the actual relationship of the lower and the upper arcade is one to three rather than one to two, as in the drawing. The drawing is therefore most likely drawn from memory. Flaxman's inscription reveals the strong impression that this early encounter with ancient Roman architecture made on him. Location of source unknown 12. (f. 3IV) 7 (Fig- 12) after unknown model Multifigured relief composition Graphite (image turned 900 anti-clockwise) This faint, hardly legible graphite sketch has to be considered abandoned. It records in the roughest outlines what is likely to be a relief composition. Three figures are discernible on the left-hand side in the foreground, and an additional group appears behind them. On the right-hand side there may be a single figure in the foreground, while a more distant action seems to be portrait in the top right-hand corner. Judging by the chronology of the drawings in this journal, the present sketch may have originated anywhere between Autun and Milan. Milan, cathedral, façade, second portal from left 13. (f. 30V) 8 (Fig. 13) after Giovanni Pietro Lasagna Jael and Sisera Graphite, pen and ink, and wash (image turned 900 anti-clockwise) Flaxman entered Milan Cathedral through the second portal from the left in the liturgical north. It shows the story of Jael who killed Sisera, a general who had fought against the Israelites, by driving a nail into his head while he was asleep (Judges, 4). This relief by Lasagna appears in the typanum above the gate. It was commis- sioned in 1629 and completed in 1640 (Hodges 1884, p. 13; Thieme and Becker 1907-50, xxn (1928), p. 402; Sannazzaro in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, xxi, pp. 532-33). The composition is based on a cartoon by Giovanni Battista Crespi which, together with Lasagna's wax model, survives in the Museo del Duomo (Bossaglia 1973, pp. 65-176, esp. 118, figs 142-44). It is hardly surprising that at this early stage of his journey Flaxman, when confronted with Milan Cathedral, drew elements of its seventeenth-century classical decoration rather than of the abundant Gothic sculpture. On f. 21V of this journal he also comments specifically on the gates and labels them 'Grecian'. See also Cat. 14. 81</page><page sequence="89">flaxman: british library journal 14.

In his sculpture Flaxman frequently uses angels as messengers and/or agents of the divine. He may therefore have been attracted by what he would have considered the graceful movements of the floating angels in this composition. See also Cat. 13. Location of the source unknown 15.

The iconography of the Dead Christ in the Tomb Sup- ported by Angels was particularly popular in northern Italy during the fifteenth century, but the present relief remains unidentified. The position of the drawing in the sketchbook suggests that Flaxman saw it somewhere in Milan, Parma or on the way between these two centres. Parma, Academy of Arts 16.

Fig. 16 Folio 27V. 83</page><page sequence="91">flaxman: british library journal The Praying Boy , a hellenistic Bronze sculpture, was in 1746 acquired by the King of Prussia, Frederick II, and is today in Berlin (Zimmer and Hackländer 1997). What Flaxman saw was a plaster cast in the cast collection of the Academy and it must have been the white colour and general appearance of the copy that made him assume that the original was made of marble. The graceful, almost ethereal stance and attitude of the figure obviously attracted Flaxman. He assumed a frontal viewpoint for this drawing and, while concentrating large- ly on the oudine, he also used wash for subtle effects of tonal modelling. NOTES 1 The Church of St. Germain l'Auxerre in the Place du Louvre is the burial place of Anne-Claude-Philippe Comte de Caylus (1692-1765). Flaxman made a study of the tomb on f. 33V of this MS; see catalogue of drawings. Comte de Caylus was an important antiquarian, his major work the Recueil d'antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grecques et romaines , 7 vols., Paris, 1752-67. The church was also resting place of a large number of architects, sculptors, painters and engravers. 2 Flaxman seems to refer to the sculpture of Henry IV on the Pont Neuf (cf. below f. ior and note 39). La Monnaie, the royal mint, completed in 1775, Jacques Denis Antoine, architect (R. Carter in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, il, p. 172). 4 Most likely the Ste Chapelle on the île de la Cité, con- secrated in 1248 to house major Christian relics, including the Crown of Thorns (A.M. Brodie in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, XXVII, pp. 550-51). The Palais de Justice was built in its present form from 1783-86 by Desmaison and Antoine. The building's predecessor (burned down in 1776) was nicknamed 'Palais des Marchands* because of the merchant stalls in the galleries and Great Hall (Stein 1927, pp. 58-63). It is possible that Flaxman copied this French sentence together with some of the other notes on this page from a French guidebook which may or may not be the Description de Paris of which he notes the price of 2 shillings 6 pence on f. 39V. Another reference to a Paris guidebook can be found on f. 9V. A number of eighteenth-century guides are entided (or typically referred to as) Description de Paris , but it has been impossible to trace the specific sentence or establish which text Flaxman used. The church of Saint-Eustache (Rue du Jour in the first arrondissement) was built from 1532 to 1640. The façade, destroyed in 1688, was rebuilt from 1754 to 1788 according to plans by Jean Hardouin-Mansart de Jouy (M. Eschapasse in Dictionnaire des Églises 1966-71, pp. IV c. 68-69). The church, in 1787 still a building site, may have attracted Flaxman's attention as it combined Gothic architecture with classical forms. It was started during the reign of Henri II (1547-59) but there is no mention in the literature of Philibert de Torme (c. 1510-70) as its architect. 7 The Tuileries, built by Philibert de l'Orme under Cath- erine de* Medici after the death of her husband, Henri II, from 1564 to 72 (V. Hofïmann in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xix, p. 693). The monument for Francis I in St. Denis, commissioned in 1548 from Philibert de l'Orme (P. Rouillard in Grove Dictonary of Art 1996, xxvn, p. 547). Flaxman makes a draw- ing of it on f. 34r. He believed it to be like the monument to Henry II and Catherine de Medici by Germain Pilon (c. 1536-90) after the design of Francesco Primaticcio (1504/05-70). 9 Dagobert I was generally believed to have founded the first church of St. Denis about 630, though Flaxman seems to give the year 605; modern research has established the earlier date of 475 (Crosby 1942, p. 67). Flaxman refers here to the tomb of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany in Saint-Denis (1516-31), and a sculptor 'Ponte' whom he names again in the context of the same monument on fF. i or- iov. Three artists with Italian names are related to the tomb, Antoine Giusti and Jean I Giusti who executed the sculptural decoration apart from the recumbent figures (these are attributed to Guillaume Regnault), and Guido Mazzoni, to whom the design of the tomb is occasionally attributed (alternatively attributed to Jean Perréal; P. Rouillard in Grove Dictonary of Art 199 6, xxvn, pp. 546-47). 11 The monument for Henry II and Catherine de' Medici, 1561-70, in Saint Denis was designed and commissioned by Primaticcio as Surintendant des Bâtiments du Roi on behalf of the King's widow, Catherine de' Medici, from Germain Pilon (c. 1525-90; J. Thirion in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxiv, pp. 812-13). Flaxman made a sketch of the related earlier monument for Francis I on f. 34r. 12 Giuseppe Franchi, Professor of Sculpture at the Accademia di Brera in Milan (C. Brook, 'Franchi, Giuseppe', Dizionario biografico degli italiani , l, Roma, 1998, pp. 96-98). He guided the Flaxmans through its collection, cf. f. 2 ir below. 13 The old name for Brighton. Flaxman also uses the modern name; cf. below f. 4V. 14 Up to the early twentieth century ivory carving was important in Dieppe (Guide Bleu 1921, p. 168; Millet 1904, pp. 147-86). 15 The oldest part of the castle goes back to the thirteenth century, most of it was built in the mid-fifteenth century. 6 Building of the church of Saint-Jacques began in 1250. Most of the chapels are additions from the fifteenth century (A. Fouré in Dictionnaire des Églises 1966-71, pp. IV B 56-57). 17 The group was destroyed during the French revolution (A. Fouré in Dictionnaire des Églises 1966-71, p. IV B 57). 18 The Adoration of the Shepherds by Philippe de Cham- paigne, 1643 (A. Fouré in Dictionnaire des Églises 1966-71, p. IV B 141). 19 Constructed between 1522 and 1640, this is a Gothic building with renaissance elements (A. Fouré in Dictionnaire des Églises 1966-71, p. IV B 57). The sculpture (1753-55) by Paul Ambroise Slodtz on the Place du Vieux Marché does not survive (Thieme and Becker 1907-50, xxxi (1937), p. 150; F. Souchal, 'Slodtz', in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxvin, p. 845). 84</page><page sequence="92">flaxman: british library journal 21 Rouen cathedral was built between 1201 and 1542, the façade dates from the end of fourteenth/beginning of fifteenth century (A. Fouré in Dictionnaire des Églises 1966-71, pp. IV B, 135-37). 22 The tomb is now in the ambulatory of the church (A. Fouré, in Didionnaire des Eglises 1966-71, p. IV B 142). 23 This is most likely the tomb of Louis de Brézé, Grand Senechal and Governeur of Normandy, erected by his widow, Diane de Poitiers, between 1535-44, attributed to Jean Goujon (A. Fouré in Dictionnaire des Églises 1966-71, p. IV B 142). Flaxman only recalls the figures of the bottom tier of the elaborate monument. 24 The Duke of Bedford (d. 1435) was regent of France on behalf of his brother. An inscription behind the bishop's throne marks his burial place (A. Fouré in Dictionnaire des Églises 1966-71, p. IV B 142). 25 This is not a direct Bible quote, cf. Exodus 25-31. 26 Though there is a reference to a Paris guidebook on £ 39V, and what may be extracts from such a text on f. iv, it is impossible to determine which guidebook Flaxman refers to; cf. nos. 5 and 105. 27 The now badly damaged high relief is positioned in the west façade above and to the right of the south portal. 28 The monument (1777) was executed by Guillaume Coustou; it was later moved to a chapel in the ambulatory (Y. Christ in Didionnaire des Églises 1966-71, p. II A 146). 29 Antoine Le Pautre, 1621-79, provided plans for the palace at Versailles in 1669, but these were not adopted. Le Pautre published some of his work in his Desseins de Plusieurs Palais (1652-53) which may have been known to Flaxman (R. W. Berger in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xix, pp. 210, 212). 30 Charles Le Brun (1619-90) was in charge of the decora- tion of the palace and gardens at Versailles (C. Constans in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xix, pp. 23-24). 31 Pierre Mignard I (1612-95) painted in 1685 the ceiling of the Petite Galerie at Versailles (destr.; L. Nikolenko in Grove Didionary of Art 1996, xxi, p. 498). 32 The Bassin du Char d'Apollon (1668-70) by François de Francine, with the group Apollo in his Chariot by Jean Tuby (N. Miller in Grove Didionary of Art 1996, xi, p. 344). 33 Milo of Croton Attacked by a Lion (1671-82) by Pierre Puget, now in the Louvre (K. Herding in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxv, p. 706; Irwin 1979, p. 31). 34 Perseus Freeing Andromeda (1675-84) by Pierre Puget, now in the Louvre (K. Herding in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxv, p. 706); the ancient group of Paetus and Arria is now also in the Louvre (Irwin 1979, p. 31); Flaxman also refers to another copy of this group in the Villa Ludovisi (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 25V.); Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 282-84, cat. no. 68. 35 See above, note 8. 36 J. Thirion (in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxiv, p. 814) mentions and reproduces a bronze relief of the Deposition now in the Louvre, which is believed to derive from the monument of Chancellor René de Birague (1506-83) in the church of Sainte Catherine-du-Val-des-Ecoliers in Paris where it would have been juxtaposed with a (documented) terracotta relief of the Resurrection. The church was demol- ished shortly before Flaxman's visit, the monuments trans- ferred to the Jesuit church in Rue Saint-Antoine (Beaulieu 1990, p. 258). At Ste. Geneviève Pilon had executed a tomb for one of its abbots, Joseph Foulon (destroyed during the Revolution). The contract of 1587 does not mention any reliefs (Babelon 1927, p. 53). Flaxman's statement, if correct, could indicate that the Louvre Deposition derives from this monument. 37 See note 10. 38 Michel Anguier, 1612-86, French sculptor who stayed in Rome from 1641-51, working in the workshops of Bernini and Algardi (Th.

This was destroyed H11792. One of the many surviving bronze statuettes is in the Wallace Collection (L. Seelig in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, vm, p. 808). The erection of the pedestal was overseen in 1701 by Robert de Cotte who designed the buildings that border on the square in 171 1. He was consulted again in 1732 about the fountains (Blomfìeld 192 1, 11, pp. 42, 44). The nineteenth- century replacement of the equestrian monument is by Francois-Frédéric Lemot (1820-25) (Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xix, p. 140). 48 See Irwin 1979, p. 31. 49 Pont Bonvoisin. 50 The Guiers runs through Les Echelles and at St-Genix- sur-Guiers into the Rhône.

Flaxman must have travelled with this second edition, as the first edition makes no mention of the Mausoleum. 53 Montmélian; the monument is mentioned and partly transcribed in Lalande (1786, 1, p. 5) 'natura occlusam, Romanis intentam, ceteris desperatam, etc.' [hidden by nature, unattempted by the Romans and despaired by others]. Lalande also gives the date 1670. For other references to the monument see Mrs Flaxman's travel diary (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. i8r) and later Gray (i794» P- 216). In contrast to these travellers, Flaxman records the form of the monument and not the text. 85</page><page sequence="93">flaxman: british library journal 54 Montmélian. 55 Lanslebourg. 56 Lac du Mont-Cenis. 5 Dr Benjamin Bates and his daughter Lydia were the Flaxmans's travel companions on most parts of the journey (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. ir; Ingamells 1997, p. 59). 58 Novalese. 59 The Abbey of S.

Gabrielli in Thieme and Becker 1907- 50, xxviii (1934), p. 394). The inscription is transcribed by Lalande 1769, 1, p. 88. 63 It is now attributed to a follower of Rubens; for a reproduction, see Rosenberg 1905, p. 457. 64 Anthony van Dyck, The Three Children of Charles I (163 5) (Bernardi 1968, p. 212); it is also mentioned by Lalande 1769, i, p. 92. 65 Cf. Lalande 1769, 1, p. 93. This is most likely The portrait of a Rabbi in the Galleria Sabauda, attributed by Bernardi to Salomon Köninck (Bernardi 1968, p. 222). 66 This work remains unidentified. 67 This is one of two Pastoral Landscapes now in the Galleria Sabauda, now attributed to an imitator of Claude (Röthlis- berger 1961, 1, p. 534, cat. nos. 277-78; 11, pp. 368-69). 68 Orazio Gentileschi, Annunciation (Gabrielli 1971, pp. 132-33, cat. no. 469; see also Irwin 1979, p. 31 with % 37).

The label 'Grecian' referring to their classical forms in the context of the cathedral can also be found in printed travel literature (e.g., Martyn 1787, pp. 72-73). 73 Marco d'Agrate, c. 1562 (Price Amerson 1969, pp. 189- 206; Bossaglia 1973, pp. 65-176, esp. p. 106 with fig. 120). 74 On the sixteenth-century choir stalls, see G. B. Sannazzaro in Majo 1986, pp. 185-87. 75 This is the mausoleum to Giovanni Giacomo and Gabriele de* Medici (1560-64). Vasari's claim that it was based on a design by Michelangelo has since been rejected (Spiriti 1995, P. 11). 76 The cathedral holds two cycles of twenty-eight paintings of Carlo Borromeo's life and miracles respectively, each by various late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century artists (see Arslan i960, pp. 47-60, 61-70). On the tapestries held by the cathedral, see G. B. Sannazzaro in Majo 1986, pp. 37-38. 77 Bernardino Luini, Holy Family with Sts Anne and John the Baptist (inv. no. 92) (Rossi and Rovetta 1997, p. 52). 78 The two paintings, Leonardo's Musician and Giovanni Ambrogio De Prédis' Portrait of a Lady (inv. nos. 99 and 100), were in the eighteenth century hung side by side and attrib- uted to Leonardo. According to Rossi and Rovetta (1997, pp. 60, 71) they were not identified as Francesco Sforza, but as Lodovico il Moro and his wife. 79 This copy by Vespino (Andrea Bianchi), inv. no. 1002, was commissioned by Federico Borromeo, 1611-16 (Rossi and Rovetta 1997, pp. 38-39). 80 Inv. no. 126, Raphael's cartoon for the School of Athens in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura (Rossi and Rovetta 1997» PP- 110-11). The first mentioned is the Codex Atlantico (Marinoni 1 97 5-80). Up to the Napoleonic occupation the Ambrosiana possessed further eleven or twelve codices by Leonardo which are now at the Institut de France (Galbiati 1951, p. 62); it is impossible to determine which one Flaxman saw. 82 Guercino painted the dome (eight Prophets) in 1626 and in 1627, on the walls below, eight Sibyls , The Annunciation to the Shepherds , Adoration of the Shepherds , Presentation in the Temple and Flight into Egypt (Salerno 1988, pp. 195-206). 83 These are Francesco Mochi's equestrian monuments to Ranuccio (1612-20) and Alessandro Farnese (1621-25) in the Piazza dei Cavalli (De Luca Savelíi 1981, pp. 51-57, 60-64). Lalande 1769, 1, p. 426, attributes them to Giambologna but also quotes an attribution to 'Mocha, son éleve'. Mochi was influenced by sixteenth-century Florentine sculptors (espe- cially Francavilla), but the literature does not discuss any direct relationship to Giambologna (R. Wittkower in Thieme and Becker 1907-50, xxiv (1930), pp. 601-02). The supposed Winckelmann quote cannot be found in the author's com- plete writings and stands in contrast to his non-judgemental statements about Giambologna. See also Irwin 1979, p. 33. 84 Corrreggio's Assumption of the Virgin in the cathedral, painted 1522-38 (Ekserdjian 1997, pp. 241-63). 85 Correggio's Vision of Saint John in the Church of S. Giovanni Evangelista, early 1520s (Ekserdjian 1997, pp. 95-98). 6 The term quoin is incorrectly used to describe the pendentifs. 87 Flaxman seems to refer to the illusionistic space of the pendentifs. In the Madonna della Steccata, Parmigianino only painted the vault (the frescoes in the dome are by Bernardo Gatti; Ekserdjian 2006, pp. 11-13, 177-82, 260-62). This seems to be the church of San Sepolcro (see below, note 90). 90 Correggio's Madonna della Scodella , now Galleria Nazionale, Parma, for the Church of San Sepolcro (Ekserdjian 1997, pp. 218-33). 91 Correggio's Virgin and Saint Jerome (H Giorno ), now in the Galleria Nazionale, Parma (Ekserdjian 1997, pp. 193- 204). Reproductive prints are about in abundance. Flaxman might refer to one by Sir Robert Strange (1771), based on drawing no. 88 of this engraver's A descriptive Catalogue of a Collection of Pictures, selected from the Roman, Florentine, Lom- bard, Venetian, Neapolitan, Flemish and Spanish schools , Lon- don, 1769. The painting was extremely famous in the eight- eenth century; see, for example, Lalande 1769, 1, pp. 454-55.

San Lorenzo was built in the fifth or sixth centuries and remodelled in the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. In the 1930s it has been stripped of most of its interior decoration to reveal the original fabric (D. Kinney in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, XXI, pp. 536-37). The sculptural decoration of the façade of S. Petronio dates from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. The decora- tion of the central portal is by Jacopo della Quercia, that of the two lateral doors form part of a façade design by Domenico Aimo, executed by Alfonso Lombardi, who in 1527 sculpted the Resurrection above the left portal, Amico Aspertini, Niccolò Tribolo, Girolamo da Treviso, Zaccaria Zacchi da Volterra and Properzia de' Rossi (R. J. Tuttle in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, iv, p. 280). 97 Raphael's S. Cecilia altarpiece is now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna (inv. no. 577, c. 1513-16; Bernardini 1987, cat. no. 129; see also Irwin 1979, p. 33). 98 Sir Robert Strange, 1721-92; the print (1771) is based on the drawing no. 108 in Strange 1769. 99 The picture is signed, 'Petrus Peruxinus Pinxiť. It is now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna (inv. no. 579; Bernardini 1987, cat. no. 104). Giambologna's Neptune's Fountain (1567; Avery 1987, pp. 205-09); Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 24-25 amplifies the high fame of the sculpture but also mentions contemporary criticism. 101 This was the residence of the Bolognese Senator, Carlo Caprara Montecuccoli, 1755-1816 (C. Capra in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani 1960-2006, xix (1976), pp. 177-80). Flaxman, in his Florentine diary f. 7r, compares the portrait in Bologna with that in the collection of artists' portraits in the Uffizi. 102 As mentioned in the introduction, Flaxman used the second half of the BL manuscript for full-page sketches, working from back to front. The last of these he drew on f. 27V with the labelling inscription on f. 271. It is a study of a plaster cast in the Parma Academy after the Berlin Praying Boy ; see cat. no. 16. 103 The Academy is also described by Martyn (1787, pp. 104-06) who also mentions the collection of anatomical preparations in wax and provides his readers with more detailed information about the institution and its members; see also Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 31-35. The collection of waxworks in the Istituto Anatomico of the Accademia delle Scienze still survives. It was founded by Ercole Lelli in 1739 and continued by Giovanni and Anna Manzolini, whom Flaxman refers to (Armaroli 1981, p. 9 (on the history), PP* 33_35 (on the busts of Giovanni and Anna Manzolini)). Apart from the initial line which may refer to the tide and price of a French book Flaxman may have bought or seen during his journey, the text on f. 39V consists of a table of contents of the present volume, the page numbers referring to Flaxman's original pagination. 105 Read: 2shilling 6 pence. Flaxman seems to have noted the price of a Paris guide that he may or may not have bought. For possible extracts and other references to a Paris guidebook, see ff. iv, 9v and note 5. 106 The first five lines on this page form another (aborted) attempt to compile a table of contents for the present volume. 107 James Durno (c. 1745-50, London, to 1795), painter and etcher, resident at Rome from 1774 until his death; Ingamells 1997, pp. 323-24.

Cimabue born 1240 'tho he found the Art of painting as practised by the Greek painters (under whom he studied the rudiments) in the very lowest state, their figures in general were in perpendicular upright Attitudes whether sitting or standing, the heads standing erect on the necks or leaning to one side in an unmeaning //[f. 17t] manner, the limbs without drawing &amp;c like sticks, the hands &amp; feet without perspective if in a front figures appeared to stand on the points of their toes &amp; the attitudes of the other extremities limbs few, awkward &amp; without meaning, the draperies marked chiefly in straight lines or &lt;&amp;&gt; were [sic] they were bent, one following another. In the picture he Cimabue painted for Santa Maria Novella of the Virgin Mary as large as life as life sitting with the Infant Jesus on her knee with 3 Angels on each side, about 2 feet long flying in Attitudes of devotion, in this he has improved the Art for 'tho he retained in it general appearance of his predecessors works he gave the Virgin a beautiful simple face[,] an easy turn to the head, he paid considerable attention to the folds &amp; their junctions joints in the drapery, he left out the hard outlines the Greeks used to express the features &amp; rounded them &amp; the folds of drapery with tender shadows, this is I believe one of the greatest things of Cimabue's remaining. It is much in the style of the whole length of Richard the 2d. in Westminster Abbey.107 Andrea Tafi followed his Master Cimabue's style in the Mosaic of S.'

I am indebted to Eckart Marchand for making this connection, and for his generous collaboration over other problems arising from this mss. 2 See further Flaxman's Yale Sketchbook, 1787, f. ir, where he lists, again without context, Ghirlandaio Offering of wise men / angels &lt;sarranading&gt;. The additional information there concerning the musical angels might point to the well- known Domenico Ghirlandaio Adoration of the Magi in the Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence (for which see Cadogan 2000, p. 259). See further E. Marchand in Yale Sketchbook, note 5. 3 Willey Reveley (1760-99), an English architect, who is recorded in Italy from 1784-88. He was at Rome by 10 September 1786 and apparently remained there until the summer of 1788. See Ingamells 1997, pp. 807-08. I have not identified Casa de San Roco [sic] or the other addresses noted above. At Easter 1787 Reveley was living above the Gioco Liscio on the Piazza Mignanelli, Rome. 4 The pencil inscription Luc della Robia [sir] does not appear to relate to the drawing above, in pen and grey ink, of a seated man, which was probably observed from life. 5 Giambologna, Equestrian Monument of Cosimo I de} Mediä (1594).

See Pope- Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 374-76, pl. 74, fig. 98; Avery 1987, pp. 73-74. Long-standing confusion about the correct attribution for the various elements, as discussed by Pope- Hennessy, is reflected in Northall 1766, pp. 42-43, as follows: 'At one angle of the palace is a noble large fountain, made from the design of Ammanati and Baldicini. In the center is a Neptune standing upright in his car, ten brachia in height, or nineteen feet, with four sea horses, by Bandinella The tritons, nereids, and other figures round the fountain, are of bronze by John de Bologna, and are esteemed very fine'. Cf. Martyn 1787, pp. 331-32, as follows: 'In the Piazza del Gran Duca, a fountain with Neptune, eighteen feet high, in a conch drawn by four sea-horses, and the tritons accom- panying him; in marble, by Ammanati: and twelve figures in bronze of nymphs and tritons, surrounding the edge of the basin, by Giovanni Bologna'.

Raymond, An Itinerary containing a Voyage of Italy, 1648, p. 31, as follows: '... Palazzo Vecchio , at the entrance stands two Colosses, the one of David , the other of Hercules trampling on Cacus , the first of Michael Angelo , which in my judgement comes short of the other, though he the more famous statuary'. 7 Donatello, Judith and Holofernes (1453-55).

By the time of Flaxman's visit to Florence, Ghiberti's 106</page><page sequence="113">FLAXMAN: FITZWILLIAM JOURNAL Porta del Paradiso (Pope-Hennessy IGS 1972, p. 207, pls. 73- 81) had already been engraved, in a sequence of thirty-four prints of the individual panels of the door, the architraves and cornices, to form a half-life-size reproduction of the entire gate, executed by Ferdinando Gregori and Thomas Patch, in a celebrated but rare limited edition publication, Porte del Battistero di Firenze , 1774. Flaxman ignored the Gates of Paradise, but in 1787 made his own copies of the north door panels in the Yale Sketchbook, ff. 7r, 8r, 9r, I7r, i8r, 2ir and 22r. These are after The Nativity , Christ driving the Traders from the Temple , Christ in the Storm , The Transfiguration , The Raising of Lazarus, The Agony in the Garden , and The Crucifixion. Some years later, probably in the summer of 1794, he made a further study of Christ among the Doctors in the V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 32r. 15 Andrea Pisano's Baptistery Door (1330). See Pope- Hennessy IGS 1972, pp. 190-91, pls. 46-48; Kreytenberg 1984, pp. 19-34. The entire sequence of three doors for the Baptistery was well described by Richardson 1722, pp. 43-44, as follows: 'Here are the famous Gates of Lorenzo Ghiberti , which Michael Angelo said deserv'd to be the Gates of Paradise. The Church has three Entrances, the Gates of the Principal of these were made by Andrea Pisano ; Lorenzo was afterwards employ' d to make those for another; and lastly, those of Andrea were remov'd to make room for others, by Lorenzo: they are very large, all of Brass, of a very high Relief: some of the Principal Figures being almost round: the Brass is almost turn'd blackish, excepting where it has been accidentally rubb'd, as below, where Peoples Clothes are continually brushing against it. The Gates of Andrea are in the Gothic Style of his time; but the other are of a much better Taste than one would expect to find in a Work 100 years before Raffaele. There is a little Gothicism in the Draperies, but the Naked has a Beauty and Excellency like the Antique, not much Inferior to Mich.Angelo in Any thing, and of a Purer and more Pleasing Style: ...These Gates were made in Imitation of those ancient ones of the Dome of Pisa of Bonanno Pisano , though the Work of those is extremely rude and Gothic; . . .' See further Lalande 1769, 11, p. 191; and Martyn 1787, p. 321. Flaxman made copies in the V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 32r. 16 Lorenzo Ghiberti, Tomb of St Zenobius. See Krautheimer 1956, il, pp. 77-80. Noted by Palgrave (. Murray's Guide) 1843, p. 500. Not apparently recorded by Northall, Lalande or Martyn. 17 Andrea Feruzzi, Monument of Marsilius Fidnus.

Both situated near the entrance to the nave of the Duomo. See F. Quinterio, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, v, p. 128, illus. Noted by Northall 1766, pp. 86-87 as follows: 'At the entrance of the church, on the right hand, are the busts of Brunaleschi [sic] and Giotto. The epitaph on the former is in Latin prose, and implies that he built the wonderful cupola of this church; upon which account his grateful country ordered his body to be deposited in this sacred ground, in 1446'. See further Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 182 and 186; Nugent 1769, il, pp. 294-95. Martyn 1787, p. 320-21, as follows: 'The tomb of Giotto is by one of the side doors: the epitaph by Politian. Next to it is the tomb of Brunellesco the architect: the epitaph by Aretino'. Also noted by Palgrave (Murray's Guide) 1843, pp. 498-99. 19 Uccello, Portrait of John Hawkwood (1436). See Pope- Hennessy 1969, pp. 7-9, 140, pls. 12-15; noted by Northall 1766, p. 87; Palgrave (. Murray's Guide) 1843, pp. 498-99. It had been engraved by Thomas Patch in 177 1; see F. Watson, 'The Life of Thomas Patch', in Walpole Society , xxvn, 1940, p. 47, no. 64. Orcagna attributed, Portrait of Dante. On the north wall of the Duomo, near the entrance door. Noted by Richardson 1722, p. 43, as follows: 'I was particularly pleased with Dante's Picture done by Andr. Orcagna ; he is reading, and walking in the Fields by his own House, a View of Florence at a distance; extremely well preserv'd, and of a lively Colouring. I believe this is the most Authentic Portrait of that Poet, and has entirely the same Face as the Drawing my Father has'. See also Lalande 1769, 11, p. 182; Martyn 1787, p. 321. 21 The reference to Michelangelo is mistaken. Northall 1766, p. 86, writes: 'The floor of the church is finely paved with marble*. Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 181-82, writes: 'En entrant dans l'Eglise, on remarque d'abord le pavé de marbre, dessiné avec beaucoup d'art; la partie qui est autour du Choeur, fut faite sur les desseins de Michèl-Ange'. Martyn 1787, p. 320, states: 'The marble pavement of the nave is by Francesco da San Gallo; that of the choir after designs of Michelangelo's; and the rest by Giuliano di Baccio d'Agnolo'. 22 Cf. Northall 1766, p. 88, as follows: 'Giotto's tower. Near the cathedral is one of the most beautiful towers, or steeples, in the world, built by Giotto, and not defaced by time. It is square, and the outside is all incrusted with black, red, and white marble. This structure is admired for its symmetry and strength'. And of the Baptistery Northall continues: 'This is the only remains of antiquity in Florence, and was anciently a temple dedicated to Mars ... It is an octagon of eight columns, most of which are granate, and the rest of coarse marble'.

Noted by Richardson 1722, pp. 55-56, as follows: ' Venus of Medias, of clear White Marble turn'd a little Yellowish; a Beautiful Colour; the Effect of Time: When the Sun shines on it ... 'tis almost transparent: the Hair seems to have been Gilded, and is now very dark: the Head is something too little for the Body, espe- cially for the Hips and Thighs; the Fingers excessively long, and taper, and no Mark for the Knuckles, except for the little Finger of the Right-hand ... I confess, before I saw this Statue, I had some Prejudice against it, from what I had observ'd in the Casts; and it has some Faults; but it has too such a Fleshy Softness, one would think it would yield to the T ouch.

For a very detailed (but in Flaxman's day still unpub- lished) eighteenth-century account of the Uffizi, including most of what Flaxman briefly recorded, see Gibbon 1961 (1764), pp. 129-86. This includes (pp. 179-80) an exception- ally vivid account of the Venus. After discussing the con- dition, and misquoting Cochin (loc. cit.) he continues: /Dès mon berceau j'avois toujours entendû parler de la Venus de Medicis; les livres, les conversations, les estampes, les modeles me l'avoient mille fois mis devant les yeux et cependant je n'en avois aucune idée. Pour la connoitre il faut la voir . . . C'est la sensation la plus voluptueuse que mon ail ait jamais éprouvé. Les contours les plus moelleux, les plus elegans, une rondeur douce et pleine, la molesse de la chair communiquée au marbre, et la fermeté qu'on desire encore dans cette chair exprimée sans dureté. Ce qui m' [a] attiré le plus c'est la maniere nette et gracieuse dont la tète est placée sur des épaulés dont la chute est d'un contour très coulant, la rondeur et la fermeté de la gorge qu'elle a petit mais belle, et la justesse des proportions aussi bien que la maniere naturelle dont le sculpteur a exprimé le ventre et le dos. La tète est un peu petite mais ce défaut quand il n'est pas trop fort est assez gracieux On sait que les Cheveux ont etè dorés à la maniere des anciens. Ils ne sont point finis et les petites parties n'y sont pas distinguées. Cette circonstance jointe à leur couleur qui est à present brune répand un peu d'ombre sur le visage. Le front est petit, le nés n'est point aquilin et les yeux sont un peu trop rapprochés des sourcils. Quoique ce petit visage soit joli il manque d'expression; si l'on croit que Venus est représentée dans le momment qu'elle dispute la pomme, le melange de crainte, de pudeur et de plaisir pourraient former ensemble une expression foible à force d'etre equivoque [sic]' . For a more general account of the Uffizi, with criticism of its display, see Miller 1776, 11, p. 101, as follows: 'along the sides of these galleries are ranged with as much symmetry as possible, statues and bustos; this attention to symmetry, intended to please the eye upon entering the gallery, is rather teasing to those who mean to acquire knowledge in antiques or to judge of the process and declination of sculpture in different ages, as they are not classed agreeable to their order of time, nor the countries from whence they came: here Greek remains and Etruscan are confounded together; and amongst this great number of marbles are many which do not merit a place in so fine a collection, either by their antiquity or the merit of their workmanship'. 24 The Wrestlers.

Northall 1766, p. 59; Lalande 1769, 11, p. 237: 'LES LUTTEURS, sont un beau groupe bien composé, &amp; d'une grande prcision de dessein; quoque cet ouvrage soit d'une très-difficile exécution, il n'a point de parties plus foibles les unes que les autres'; Martyn 1787, p. 336. See further Miller, 1776, 11, p. 115, as follows: 'The Wrestlers are a group I could never sufficiently admire; I walked round and round them until I was quite weary. Their attitudes are amazing, so regular an entanglement is marvellous; the countenance of the vanquished expresses the feelings of his soul; his humiliating situation, disappointment, rage, and shame sit on his brow: in the other's face, triumph, courage, a contempt of fatigue'. The Wrestlers were first thought to be part of The Niobe group , but this idea had already lost favour by 1638 (cf. Perrier 1638, pls. 35-36). At Florence the sculpture was not exhibited with the Niobe group when that group was transferred to a special dedicated room at the Uffizi in 1781. Yet Flaxman, perhaps following Winckelmann, appears still to have believed in this link. 25 The Niobe group. Antique marble group. Copies, some after Scopas or Praxiteles. Uffizi. Excavated at Rome and acquired by Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici in 1583. Trans- ferred to Florence in 1769/70 and exhibited at Uffizi in a dedicated room from 1781.

Noted at Florence by Lady Miller 1776, 11, p. 375; Forsyth 1816, p. 42. Flaxman 1829, Lecture III, pp. 96-97, writes as follows: 'The group of Niobe and her youngest daughter, by Scopas, is an example of heroic beauty in maturer age. The sentiment is maternal affection. She exposes her own life to shield her child from the threatened destruction. The separate statues of the children all partake of the same heroic beauty, mixed with the passions of apprehension and dismay'. The Florentine statues are catalogued by Mansuelli, followed by Haskell and Penny, as antique copies, some of which are believed to be derived from originals by Scopas or Praxiteles or their contemporaries, and to be related to those known to Pliny. Flaxman, who does not raise the question of these marbles being copies, supposed The Wrestlers (Haskell and Penny 1981, cat no. 94), now Tribuna of Uffizi, for which see note 24 above, to belong to this group: 'To this series belongs that fine example of anatomical study in difficult but harmonious composition, the group of wrestlers' (ibid., p. 97).

On a remarqué que la tète quoique très bonne etoit sans noblesse; si elle devoit représenter un Esclave ce n'est qu'une beauté de plus [sic]9, Lalande 1769, 11, p. 237: 'figure bien pensée, d'un mou- vement simple et naturel; pleine d'expression. &amp; don't le des- sein a un caractere de vérité qui répond à l'état de l'ouvrier qu'on a réprésenté'; Martyn 1787, p. 337. See further Northall 1766, p. 59, as follows: 'The slave whetting his knife and listening, is finely executed. The head and the hair of this piece are particularly admired; but the virtuosi in Florence are divided about it, as to what it was intended to represent'; and Miller 1776, il, p. 115, as follows: 'The Arrotino, or as it is here called the Rotatore , is evidently listening and struck with horror and dismay at what he overhears; this slave's character is finely expressed, and his face, though very ugly, seems as if worn by a cruel servitude, into the hard lines that mark his features; his attitude is perfectly natural, and this statue well deserves the great character all connoisseurs have given it'. 28 Apollino.

Martyn 1787, p. 337; Gibbon 1961 (1764), pp. 181-82: 'Le Corps est très beau et l'estomac est exprimé avec une vérité et une justesse extaordinaire ... La tète est restaurée mais elle est belle ... Le marbre est d'une couleur un peu bise. On a remarqué qu'elle exprime fort bien la peau tannée d'un jeune Sauvage qui court les forets à moitié nud, mais cette beauté me paroit un peu chimérique [sic] . .'. Northall 1766, p. 59, as follows: 'a dancing Faunus, whose agility is finely expressed, with the crotata in his hands, and a scabillum under one foot. Michael Angelo is said to have added the head and arms to it, but the piece is originally ascribed to no less a person than Praxiteles . . .'. Also noted by Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 236-37, as follows: 'Une autre statue de la plus grande beauté est LE FAUNE, jouant des crotales ou cimbales, &amp; ayant un pied sur la scabila ou crupezia, espéce [51c] d'instrument en forme de soufflet, qui rendoit des sons à-peu- près comme les soufflets qui sont dessous ces petits oiseaux de bois, dont s'amusent les petits enfans; le mouvement du Faune est très-beau, &amp; les members en sont sçavamment contrastés. Cet antique n'est pas cependant du dernier fini; on remarque aussi que la tête &amp; les mains en ont été restaurées par Michel- Ange, mais c'est avec tant de gôut qu'ils sont dignes du reste de la figure'.

This Group is of very excellent Goût , but differs from the other as Masculine does from Feminine, for This is Mich. Angelo and That has all the Delicacy of the famous Venus, as a Bacchus ought to have'. Wright 1730, p. 397; Cochin 1758, il, p. 40 : 'Une statue de Bacchus , par Michel-Ange , d'un bel ensemble, d'une maniere grande, de grande contours &amp; de grandes formes, mais avec peu de vérité, chargée, tortillée &amp; maniérée: la téte n'est pas forte belle, &amp; a des sécheresses'; Gibbon 1961 (1764), p. 173: 'On reproche à cette statue d'etre tortillée, mais elle est assurément pleine de la plus belle expression'.

Les caresses de l'amour et de Psyché n'etoient pas tout à fait si enfantines [sic]'. Northall 1766, p. 47; Lalande 1769, 11, p. 220; Flaxman 1829, m, p. 97, observes that 'the beautiful and interesting group of Cupid and Psyche is not mentioned by Pliny'. See further Flaxman 1829, Lecture IX, 'Ancient Art', p. 285, where he returns to this group: 'The group of Cupid and Psyche, interesting from the beauty of youthful male and female forms and harmony of lines, is an allegory of the Pythagorean philosophy, representing the union of desire and the soul'. 61 The Orator. Bronze. Roman. Museo Archaeologico, Florence. See Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 241, under cat. no. 50, The Idol (Florence, Museo Archeologico): 'The Idol was displayed in the Uffìzi together with the bronze Minerva, the bronze Chimaera, and the bronze portrait statue known as the Arringatore or Orator (but called by Gori an Etruscan Haruspex, and earlier identified as a Consul or as Scipio Africanus), all of which were considered as Etruscan'. For the origins and fortuna critica of these statues, see further Cristofani 1979, pp. 4-15. For the changing name of the Orator , see Evelyn 1955, 11, p. 189, note 2, as Scipio; Raymond 1648, p. 33, as Scipio Africanus; Lasseis 1670, 1, p.161, ' Scipio Africanus in Brass, shewing the ancient habit and dress of the old Romans, farr different from our mode'; Richardson 1722, p. 48: ' Tuscan Orator, a great Taste, and fine Expression of Energy.

Elle a pareillement sa legende Etrusque. Cette Chimère m'interesse beaucoup. Elle m'apprend que dans ces siecles qui sont à peine historiques, quand la sculpture etoit dans son enfance et l'Etrurie dans un etat florissant, il y avoit entre las Toscans et les Grècs une correspondance fort etroite qui avoit fait adopter à ceux la les arts et même les fables d'une nation ingenieuse destinée dans tous les tems à eclairer l'occident.

Bronze. Roman. Now Museo Archaeologico, Florence. Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 240, cat. no. 50, fig. 123, notes suggestions that it is a Greek original of the school of Polykleitos, but concludes with Martin Robertson, A History of Greek Art , Cambridge, 1975, 1, p. 332, that it is a Roman work in the Polyclitan manner. Earlier the bronze had been known as a Bacchus, and as Haskell and Penny point out 'this is reflected in the decorations of the modern pedestal, much praised by eighteenth-century travellers who persistendy ascribed it to Ghiberti'. Noted by Richardson 1722, pp. 46-47: ' Bacchus , a most Noble Figure in Hammer'd Brass, (without the Feet) it has a magnificent Pedestal, made by Lorenzo Ghiberti , with Bas-reliefs upon it as fine as the Statue itself. These Bas-reliefs are not of so great a Relief as those of the Gates of St John , but of a better Taste, and equal to any Antique. On one side is the Triumph of Ariadne, and on the other, a Sacrifice to Bacchus'. See further Cochin 1758, II, p. 45: 'Une figure d'homme, de bronze, d'un ensemble &amp; d'un contour fort léger, élégant &amp; beau: elle est sur un piédestal de bronze décoré de fort bons bas-reliefs, &amp; d'ornemens bien travaillés &amp; du meilleur gôut'; Gibbon 1961 (1764), p. 177: ' Un Jeune homme statue de bronze. Elle a de la noblesse, de l'elegance et de la justesse; mais il n'y a aucun attribut qui puisse designer le personage. On en fait commu- nément un Apollon ou un Bacchus'. Northall 1766, p. 47. 64 For the pedestal wrongly attributed to Ghiberti, see note 63 above. 65 Eckart Marchand suggests this is The Doriphoros. Antique marble. After Polykleitos.

However, since Flaxman here describes his Athleta under Etruscan bronzes, a cautionary note concerning the present otherwise convincing identification is required. Cf. Gibbon 1961 (1764), p. 171: ' Un Athlète. On voit de la science du nud et de la force dans le corps. Il tient un vase dans les mains. On peut l'interpreter différemment; comme le prix de sa victoire et seulement comme un vase qui contenoit l'huile dont les Athlètes se servoient pour se frotter le corps. Cependant à le voir seul, sans etre accompagné de palmes, de couronnes ou d'autres symboles de la victoire je pencherois vers le dernier sens [sic]'. 66 Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpent.

Here is a judicious Clair Obsc. and fine Colouring throughout; particularly the Arm of the Christ in the Light has a great Variety of Tincts, and very delicate; the Hand of the Virgin that is uppermost, and the foremost Foot of the Christ Disagreeably, if not Wrong Drawn. Highly finish'd, and hatch'd in the Shadows in many places; the hair of the Christ comes over his Forehead in single Hairs, or a few sticking together as if he sweated*. Noted by Northall 1766, pp. 70- 71: 'One by Raphael. Here is also another by him, the most beautiful of his hand, which is called the Madonna del Siggiole, from the chair in the picture that the virgin is sitting in, with the child in her lap. Her countenance is inexpressibly sweet, seeming full of affection for the babe, and in her manner of holding it, gently pressing it to her bosom, with her head reclined, looking full at you.

Boboli Gardens. Eckart Marchand suggests this is a partly restored copy of the Aristogiton , one of the bronze Tyrannicides by Kritios and Besiotes (477 bc, Athens). The copy is a pendant to an old warrior who stands opposite in the violone that leads down to Giambologna's fountain, as described by Flaxman here. See F. Guerrieri and J.

Lalande 1769, 11, p. 346, also draws attention to the early painters who worked there, albeit in fairly general terms as follows: 'Il y a encore dans cette Eglise plusieurs peintures de Cimabué &amp; de Giotto; on aime à voir les premiers essais de ces illustres Restaurateurs de la Peinture: on admire sur-tout les Crucifix peints par Cimabué, qui sont près de la porte d'entrée'.

The tombs, executed by Michelangelo, 1524-34, were often noted by Grand Tourists, notably Richardson 1722, p. 76; Northall 1766, pp. 92-93; Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 315-16: 'Ces quatre figures sont plus grandes que nature, dans des attitudes couchés, traitées d'une manière fiere &amp; grande; les formes en sont belles &amp; sçavantes, quoiqu'un peu outrées. On y admire un feu de composition &amp; un caractère de dessein inimitable. Elles ont des parties qui ne sont pas entièrement terminées, mais qui ne font pas moins de plaisir aux artistes &amp; aux vrais connoisseurs, en leur décou- vrant avec quelle hardiesse il faisoit déjà sentir, par le seul secours de la pointe &amp; de la gradine, de la fierté dans ses ébauches'. Flaxman in his turn made several records from a position in front of the Medici tombs in the Yale Sketch- book, in 1787; see ff. 23r, 24r, 25r, for Tomb of Giuliano de ' Mediä with details of the allegorical figures of Day and Night ; f. 26r for Tomb of Lorenzo de ' Mediä. He later returned to the tomb of Giuliano, probably in 1794, and made two sketches in the V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, pp. 126-27, which as Whinney (1956, pp. 277-79) and Marchand (in the catalogues below) have suggested may reflect his own creative preoccupation with the Mansfield monument. 100 For Filippo Brunelleschi Christ on the Cross , see Pope- Hennessy 1RS 1971, p. 245, no. iii. Reputedly inspired by rivalry with the wooden Crucifix by Donatello in S. Croce. Lalande 1769, 11, p. 311: 'ce qu'on remarque de préférence est un ancien tableau de Cimabué, le meilleur qui soit sorti des mains de ce célebre restaurateur de la peinture, il est dans la Chapelle des Ruccellai; on y remarque aussi un beau Crucifix en bois, de Brunellesco, qui excelloit dans la sculpture &amp; dans la peinture, aussi bien que dans l'architecture, quoique celle- ci soit demeurée son principal titre de gloire dans la postérité'. For works of art in S. Maria Novella, see further Martyn 1787, pp. 324-25, and 1791, p. 342. Pasquino , also known as Menelaus carrying the body of Patroclus. Antique marble.

Attributed to Polykleitos, from 15 10, after its transfer to the Vatican by Pope Julius II; but more probably a later Roman derivation from a Hellenistic prototype.

Flaxman 1829, hi, p. 95, suggests that 'The group of Hercules and Anteus, in the palace Pitti at Florence, may be a marble copy from the bronze, on which the copyist inscribed the name of the original artist'. For a drawing by Flaxman after the Hercules , see the Yale Sketchbook, 1787, f. 271. 103 Farnese Hercules. Antique marble copy. Palazzo Pitti courtyard. This version is inscribed in Greek with the name of Lysippus; it is said to have been dug up on the Palatine and sold to Cosimo I de' Medici. For this copy and the original, now in Naples, see Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 226-32, cat. no. 46, fig. 118, and p. 230. See further Mansuelli 1958-61, i (1958), pp. 58-59, cat. no. 35. According to Haskell and Penny, writing of the prototype, there is now some consensus 'that the Hercules is an enlarged version, made by Glycon for the Baths of Caracalla in the early third century A.D., of a statue of the same hero produced by Lysippus or his school'. 104 Andrea del Sarto, Scenes from the life of Filippo Benizzi and the Birth of the Virgin. See Berenson 1963, 1, pp. 8-9 and il, pls. 1375-76 and 1387. Masaccio and Masolino painted a fresco cycle that was then completed by Filippino Lippi in the Brancacci chapel of S. Maria del Carmine, including Scenes from the life of St. Peter and St. Paul , the Temptation of Adam and Eve and the Expulsion from Paradise. See H. Wohl, in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, XX, pp. 534-35. The frescoes which were badly affected by fire in 1771 had been described by Vasari (1568), Milanesi 1878-85, il, pp. 305-25, but ignored by most travel writers including Northall 1766, but cf. Lalande 1769, 11, p. 291. However, twenty-four details were engraved by Thomas Patch in 1770, in a rare and seminal volume, published in Florence and dedicated to Sir Horace Mann. The frescoes were restored in 1782; some scenes were later published by Tommaso Piroli as a suite of six aquatints (see Borea 1993, pp. 51-53, pl. 14); and at about the same time he also engraved two scenes for William Young Ottley, dated 1798 (see Ottley 1826, pls. XLIII and XLIV). See Ottley 1808-23, p. 14, for his view of the frescoes in S. Maria del Carmine (where, however, he did not satisfactorily distinguish the respective contributions of Masaccio and Filippino Lippi): 'In all the executive parts of the art Masaccio eminently excelled; but I cannot join in the opinion of those who con- sider him as having been equally a master of invention and composition. His aim was to make the best possible transcript of the model before him. Hence his frescoes, in the celebra- ted chapel of the Carmine, at Florence, present many admi- rable portraits of his friends and contemporaries. But these figures, though they almost seem alive, too often fail to express by their actions or gestures those feelings which the event whereof they are represented as spectators should natu- rally have awakened. In the miracle of the Boy restored to life by St. Peter, and in the martyrdom of the same Saint, the surrounding figures appear no more affected than so many indifferent persons, met together in the market-place, to talk over the ordinary news of the day. This work of Masaccio, however, greatly contributed to hasten the happy era of painting which followed; by exhibiting a far more perfect model in all that respects the executive parts of the art, than had heretofore been offered to the contemplation of the student. In the correctness of his outline and the vivacity of his heads Masaccio was imitated by his contemporaries and immediate successors; and henceforth the Florentine painters accustomed themselves to prepare careful drawings from nature, of the figures they proposed to introduce into their pictures: but the dignified simplicity of his draperies, the IH</page><page sequence="121">FLAXMAN: FITZWILLIAM JOURNAL breadth of his chiaroscuro, and the mellowness of his colour- ing, were qualities which artists of that time could not appreciate'. Flaxman made no copies of these frescoes. Humbert de Superville, perhaps in the company of Ottley in 1798, copied the Masaccio Expulsion from Paradise; see Torrini 1991, appendix, p. 179, pl. 33 (Leiden University PK. 1449). For Arnolfo di Cambio (d. 1302) who was the first Master of the new Cathedral, see Joachim Poeschke, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, pp. 480-85. 107 This is the Duccio Rucellai Madonna.

It was still attributed to Cimabue in 1843, cf. Palgrave ( Murray's Guide) 1843, p. 518. This celebrated picture was not copied by Flaxman, Ottley or de Superville but was reproduced, appar- ently for the first time, by Séroux ďAgincourt 1810-23, v, pl. CVIII. See further III, p. 128, where he writes of it thus: 'elle est de Cimabué, dont le nom est célèbre pour avoir con- tribué à la renaissance de l'Art en essayant le premier d'éloigner de la routine grossière suivie jusqu'alors par les maîtres grecs dont il avait été disciple'. The English panel (controversially linked to Bohemian painting) of Richard II in Westminster Abbey, London, dates from 1394-95; see P. Binski, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, ix, p. 607, fig. 32. 108 For the Baptistery mosaics, attributed by Vasari to Andrea Tafi, see C.

These frescoes were situated on the outside walls of the convent, adjacent to the façade of the church, on both sides of the former entrance to the cloister. They were destroyed in the nineteenth century when this corner of the piazza and the entrance to the cloister were redesigned. An earlier engraving of the piazza, based on a design by Michael Ciocchi, was published by Richa 1754, 1, between pp. 34-35. Richa 1754, 1, p. 39, describes the frescoes noted by Flaxman and attributes them to Lorenzo di Credi. He suggests the Assumption of the Virgin , described by Flaxman as the Virgin sitting in glory, was generally recognised as the best work of Lorenzo di Credi.The frescoes are not mentioned by Northall 1766, pp. 95ff; nor by Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 340-48; nor Martyn 1787, pp. 326-27. 115 See note 114 above. 116 See note 1 above.

Gibbon 1961 (1764), pp. 137-38, gives a long description of early Italian pictures in this room, but selects for special attention two further pictures by Fra Angelico: 'On voit ici une suite de tableaux des plus anciens maitres depuis la renaissance de la peinture, et l'on peut suivre tous les pas qu'a fait cet art jusqu'à sa perfection. J'ai vû deux tableaux de Fra Giovanni Angelico, le marriage et l'enterrement de la vierge. Ils sont extrême- ment finis dans les details quoique sans connoisance de la perspective et d'un dessein fort incorrect. Le coloris est riche et brillant, mais tranchant et sans harmonie. Il y a quelque expression dans le dépit des Rivaux infortunés de Joseph . . . Il y a encore quelques morceaux de Mantegna qui sont d'un fini excessif [sic] . .'. 119 This is a reference to Leonardo da Vinci's celebrated Last Supper in the refectory of the convent of S. Maria delle Grazie. See also BL Journal, f. 23r. 120 Inscribed 9 uHnlasses [51c] . Possibly recording the erection of an obelisk. Pius VI had erected three obelisks in the Piazza Montecitorio, Piazza del Quirinale, and in front of Trinità dei Monti (1786) but this was shortly before Flaxman arrived in Rome. His drawing might therefore be a copy, based on someone else's record. For instance the architect, Mr Reveley (see note 3 above), had observed at first hand and described in his Dictionary the erection of the obelisk in Piazza del Quirinale; see Ingamells 1997, p. 807. Alterna- tively this drawing may be Flaxman's own first-hand record of the erection of some other monument, column or statue, ancient or modern. Martin Kemp has observed that the draw- ing lacks any true understanding of the hydraulics involved in any such operation. It may be a mistake to take this drawing too seriously. The drawing immediately below, showing the hoisting of a column, appears to relate to the same hydraulic exercise. 121 For the origins of the Ludovisi collection, see Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 27-29.

Souchal, in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, xn, p. 725, fig. 1. However Flaxman almost certainly saw the Bernini, Pluto and Proserpina (1622), (now Galleria Borghese, Rome), which had been presented by Cardinal Scipione Borghese to Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi and taken to the Villa Ludovisi in 1623. The Bernini was seen there, correctly attributed to Bernini and described under the Roman name of Proserpine, by Northall 1766, p. 348; and by Lalande 1769, ra, pp. 517-18. See H. Hibbard, Bernini.

However, Flaxman 1829, Lecture III, 'Grecian Sculpture', p. 97, recognized that the Greek tradi- tion ran on strongly well beyond this date: 'it will appear that sculpture did not arrive at maturity until the age of Phidias, 490 years before the Christian era; and Pliny's chronological catalogue of the most celebrated Greek artists continues 160 years later, or to 330 before Christ: after which time, however, the Laocoon, and several of the finest groups and statues, seem to have been executed'.

SKETCHBOOK USED BY JOHN FLAXMAN DURING HIS STAY IN ITALY (1787-94) CONTAINING SKETCHES FROM FLORENCE AND ROME, DATED 4 NOVEMBER 1787 (Yale Center for British Art, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. Printroom inv. no. B 1975. 3. 468 (a- aaaa)) Catalogued by Eckart Marchand Editor's Note The sketchbook consists of 80 folios, measuring each approx. 22 x 15.3 cm. It is made of Italian paper with stationery binding. The cover is made of parchment which bears some lettering that is illegible and mosdy erased. This erasion may date before Flaxman's acquisition of the book. The book can be closed with a flap attached to what would have been intended to be the back cover, and tightened with two straps (now lost) that were attached to this flap and the intended front cover of the book. Flaxman used the book the other way round, turning the back cover into the front cover, and the modern folio numbering follows his use. If opened this way, the flap is attached to the front cover and could be used to hold back previous pages while working on the right-hand side page of the opened book (Fig. 1). What is now f. 8ov would originally have been intended as f. ir and is covered in a yellow wash, apparendy to mark the opening page. Technical evidence suggests in fact that this wash was applied by the person who made the book and before Flaxman acquired it.1 The top of f. i has been cut off and stuck on again with the help of a backing, glued to the entire verso. On this the modern ex libris has been attached. The book has been completed in pen, graphite and grey wash. There is no original page numbering, a modern numbering, introduced after the acquisition of the MS by the Yale Center for British Art, is written in graphite on the versos. It is not reproduced in the present set of illustrations which was taken at the Sotheby's sale in 1972 and that therefore predates the pagination. Flaxman drew mostly on the rectos, and made annotations next to the drawings or on the versos. In addition to drawings after ancient, late medieval and Renaissance works, there is also a drawing of a horse from life. In the cover inside and on f. 1 there are notes and a scheme of Ghiberti's set of reliefs for the North Doors of the Florence Baptistery. The sketchbook contains sketches from Flaxman's first stay in Florence in 1787 and later ones from Rome. Folios 79r, 8or and 8ov Flaxman used from back to front as an account book. The entries concern Mr Wedgwood, Mr Knight and Mr J. Devaere and date from 1788 to 1791. The book belonged to the collection of Sir John Leslie, Bt., Glaslough House, Eire, and was acquired at Sotheby's on 14 December 1972 (lot 39) by Baskett and Day for Paul Mellon. It now belongs to the Yale Center for British Art, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. Editorial Conventions In the sketchbook part of the book, the individual folios have been catalogued as separate drawings with the following standard categories: descriptive tide, technique, transcription of text, identification of the model (where applicable) and related secondary literature; references in Flaxman's Lectures to the depicted works, previous mention of the drawing in the secondary literature, and a brief discussion. Flaxman's annotations are fully transcribed; spelling, capitalization and punctuation are given as seen, with editorial insertions marked by square brackets, e.g. [.], and [sic] added as indication of an originally misspelt word, repeated word, etc. Triangular brackets have been used to indicate either an illegible passage, or a word that can only be guessed, e.g. &lt;...&gt;. As the catalogue follows the sequence of the sketchbook it seemed to be sensible to give folio numbers rather than introduce catalogue numbers. The folio numbering by the present 119</page><page sequence="125">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK owners is rather complicated; it is noted in pencil on the verso of each sheet. For easier referencing, a new folio numbering has been introduced and used throughout this publication. The official numbering, essential for ordering photographs from the present owner, is stated at the beginning of each entry direcdy after the new folio number: e.g.: //f. 2r [B1975. 3. 468(a)]. //Inside cover &lt;...&gt;' &lt;...&gt; John Flaxman Sculptor began at Florence November the 4th / 1787 15 Nov. //f. ir (Fig. 2) Inscriptions: John Flaxman Sculptor began at Florence November the 4th 1787 3 ador Magi2 [4] question D* in Temp [7] driving mony changers [8] Peter on the Sea [11] entering Jems on ass [12] last Supper [16] Pilate &lt;shouHng to . . . &gt;washing his hands [13] Scourging [ig] rising from the d.d [20] descent of H* Ghost 3 &lt;4&gt; Apostles &lt;4&gt; Eldest Dct."4 1 Annunciation 2 Nativity 3 baptized by John 6 temptation by / Devil 9 transfiguration 10 raising Lazarus 13 Apostles sleeping &amp; Ld's Prayer 14 Betrayal of Judas 17 bearing the cross 18 crucifixion &lt;. . .&gt; Petraj servitore agli &lt;. . .&gt; &lt;Confarsi Donatore = San Paolo&gt; &lt;. . .

During the eighteenth century it was on display in the Uffizi. It is now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Florence (marble, height 73 cm, inv. no. 13813; Fusco and Corti 2006, p. 56, figs. 37 and 38). In this frontal view of the sculpture, Flaxman records the breakage of the left arm, though he positions it too low, and, characteristically, he focuses on the human figure, only indicating the position and shape of the quiver that functions as a support for the sculpture. Fittingly for the opening of the new sketchbook after the arrival in Florence, the drawing is worked up to a much higher degree of finish than any of the later ones. Dark wash is used to contrast the sculpture against its background. In later drawings Flaxman concentrated almost entirely on the copied works. //f. 2v [unused] Florence, Loggia dei Lanzi //f. 3r [B1975. 3.468(b)] (Fig. 4) after Benvenuto Cellini Perseus Graphite, pen and ink, and grey wash; some splashes of grey wash above the separate study of the arm Inscribed in grey ink on verso: Perseus by Benvenuto Cellini Benvenuto Cellini's Perseus stands on a marble pedestal on top of the low wall that encloses the Loggia dei Lanzi (1554, bronze, height 320 cm incl. pedestal; Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 45-47, 371, pis- 7°, 71; Pope-Hennessy 1985, pp. 163-21$, pls. 85, 86, 97-108). In the eighteenth century, the sculpture was famous through the account of its making in Cellini's autobiography, reflected for example in Gray (1794, p. 317). A less enthusiastic comment can be found in Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 206-07. Flaxman describes and praises the work in the Fitzwilliam Journal (ff. 2v, 3r, n. 8). The positive and analytical tone of Flaxman's text is echoed by the relatively large group of surviving studies that explore the sculpture from a number of different, including vir- tual, viewpoints. The two drawings in the present sketchbook date from November 1787. Four further studies in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937 are complementary and date presumably from the Flaxmans's final five-week stay in Florence in June and July 1794. They demonstrate an ongoing engagement with this sculpture. Typical of Flaxman's approach to copying, this frontal study was undertaken from a great distance, reducing the effects of perspectivai distortion and revealing as much of the body of Medusa as possible. The chosen viewpoint also reduces the psychological impact of the sculpture, as it avoids any dramatic foreshortening of the human figure and makes the drawn sword virtually invisible. The drawing is extremely delicate. Having established the outline of the figure in graphite, Flaxman fixed it carefully in pen and ink, and used wash only sparingly to indicate lower levels of relief, such as the hero's right arm. In focusing on the figure of Perseus Flaxman ran out of space at the bottom of the page and had to complete Medusa's right arm in the separate study on the right. See f. $r; V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1973, pp. 121, 122, 123, 129; Fitzwilliam Journal, ff. 2v, 3V. //f. 3v [unused] //f. 4 r [1*1975.3.468(0)] (Fig. 5) after ancient marble sculpture Cupid shooting an Arrow Graphite and pen and ink Inscribed in grey ink on verso: Another view of the 1st figure Cupid discharging an arrow This is a second study of this sculpture in the Grand Duke's collection. After the frontal view (f. 2r) Flaxman now studies the figure in profile to the right. The low viewpoint emphasizes the upward thrust of the pose. Flaxman's technique is much more economical than in the preceding drawing; only the most important outlines are fixed in pen and ink over the initial graphite sketch, there is hardly any internal modelling. The double line that describes the lower right arm is not to be read as a pentimento. Instead it is deliberately used to give volume to the arm. Pentimenti are common in Flaxman's initial graphite drawings, but rarer at the pen and ink stage.

Study 2 completes the frontal view of the sculpture through the depiction of the elaborate pedestal and the narrative relief below that accentuates the sculpture's position on the low wall of the Loggia. Relief and pedestal are both carefully described in the Fitzwilliam Journal (f. 2v). Study 1 is more abstract and conceptu- ally challenging. Here Flaxman renders the position of Medusa's headless body beneath the feet of Perseus. The drawing illustrates what he records in the Fitzwilliam Journal: 'the figure [. . .] is finely composed 'tho the limbs are so turned as to be accommodated to the Shape of the plinth' (f. 2v). Flaxman did not draw from an actual viewpoint, looking out, as it were, from a window of the Palazzo Vecchio. In fact, the orientation of the sketch with the front line of the pedestal at the top of the composition implies a viewpoint high up in the inside of the loggia. It is safe to state that this would not have been available for Flaxman, who therefore must have composed his design while standing on ground level and looking up to the sculpture. This is confirmed by the extremely tentative and disparate graphite strokes that form the initial sketch on which Flaxman bases his more confident pen and ink drawing.

Seven of these can be found in the present sketchbook and date with all likelihood from the first visit in autumn 1787. These are The Nativity , The Expulsion of the Money Changers (f. 2ir), Christ in the Storm (f. 22r), The Transfiguration (f. i8r), The Raising of Lazarus (f. I7r), The Agony in the Garden (f. 8r) and The Crudfixion (f. 9r). On f. ir Flaxman also records the sequence of the narrative panels. On his return to Florence, Flaxman made one more drawing after Christ among the Doctors (V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 32r). On that occa- sion he also studied the upper and lower part of Brunelleschi's related Competition Panel (V &amp;A Sketchbook 2790, ff. 34r and 35r). At the time of his first visit to Florence, Flaxman's interest in the North Doors appears to have been unprompted by anybody else and largely unshared (see Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 4r, n. 15). The fame of the second set, the Gates of Paradise on the other hand, was fully established in the eighteenth century. Winckelmann 1767 (1821), I, p. 100) referred to them as 'celebre', Hobhouse (1796, p. 129) mentioned Michelangelo's positive dictum about them, and plaster casts of them existed even in the Florentine Academy (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. iov). The Nativity is thé second panel from the left in the third tier above the ground (Krautheimer 1970, 11, pls. 18, 27). Like all the others it is above eye level, but it is easily visible. Flaxman indicates the quatrefoil shape of the panel and, at the top, also its frame. As in all other studies after panels from these doors, Flaxman translates the composition of a three-dimensional relief, that was designed to be seen from below, into a composition that is seen from straight on. Thus the groundstrip - tilted downwards in the relief - appears horizontal and is seen from above, while the heads of the Virgin and St. Joseph are depicted as if they were looking straight ahead rather than downward towards the beholder who stands before the doors. In the drawing, this allows the viewer to see as much of the figures as one would when glancing at the relief from below. Another common trait in all of Flaxman's studies of these compositions is the reduction of the landscape elements, carefully described by Ghiberti. Flaxman does this to enhance the legibility of the scenes and, in this particular panel, to tighten the circular design of the figurai composition. The figure of Mary Magdalen is echoed in Flaxman's own illustration Supplicants pray to the Gods (Flaxman Aeschylus 1870, pl. 12; reproduced in Irwin 1979, p. 90, fig. 114).

As in all drawings of this group, Flaxman renders the composition as if seen from straight on, thus reducing values of relief. In the interest of legibility, Flaxman suppresses the landscape elements and, while drawing, he also changes position in front of the panel to render each individual figure at its best. Thus, Christ is seen from the right, the beardless St. John in the foreground from a position further to the left. Having reduced the visual impact of the trees that fill the upper part of Ghiberti's compositon, Flaxman dispenses with any references to the quatrefoil in this part, turning the image almost into a vignette. Unchar- acteristically, Flaxman, who is usually a very close observer of details, changes the positions of the crossed arms of the angel. Rather than being an act of artistic licence, this alteration reminds one of the difficulty in reading the reliefs, as the doors are facing north and may have been relatively dirty when examined by Flaxman. 123</page><page sequence="129">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK See this sketchbook, ff. ir, 7r, 9r, ijr9 i8r, 2ir, 22r; V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 32r; Fitzwilliam Journal, £ 4r; Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 25-27, esp.

In this unfinished drawing Flaxman struggles to render the composition as though it was seen straight on; the head of Christ, that in the original relief leans dramatically forward, sits in the drawing awkwardly on the shoulders. Pentimenti above the head reflect a struggle to render the motif. Flaxman did not give the same finish to this figure as to the others which might indicate that, ultimately, he did not consider it successful and abandoned it. Of the two mourners in the foreground, the Virgin is studied from a position straight below, while St. John is recorded from further to the right, as not to obscure his face by his hand. The change of viewpoint also means that John appears in profile as if turning to the figure of Christ. The flat relief ground is only indicated where Flaxman wants to give volume to the figure of the Evangelist, and there are only minimal references to the shape of the panel.

After restoration, it was displayed in the gardens of the Villa Medici until it was removed to Florence in 1769/70 (Geominy 1984, pp. 28-39). The display in the garden of the Villa Medici as well as individual figures from the group were reproduced by Perrier (1638, pls. 99 (general view), 57 (Niobe and her youngest daughter) , and 58 (one of the daughters of Niobe)). Since 1781, the group has been on display in the Uffizi in a specially designed room (Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 274). It is in this arrangement that Flaxman would have studied the group. Although subject of critical debate, the group was generally considered to consist of original Greek sculptures in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. From the seventeenth century, if not earlier, the group was ascribed to either Praxiteles or Scopas, following a passage in Pliny (Nat. Hist. XXXVI, 28; cf. Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 274). The attribution of the originals to Scopas was reiterated by Winckelmann, who also recognized the varying quality of the sculptures in the group and implicidy acknowledged that they were copies (Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 308-09). The suggestion that they were copies was also propagated by Lalande (1786, 11, pp. 197-99). In the Fitzwilliam Journal (f. 6r) Flaxman follows the attribution to Scopas, but does not enter the discussion as to whether the statues are copies or the originals. The same position is revisited in his Lectures (Flaxman 1829, pp. 96, 284-85). That Flaxman would have studied the group is predictable. What is surprising is that the three studies in the early (and solely Florentine) part of the diary do not include the central sculpture of Niobe and her youngest 124</page><page sequence="130">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK daughter. Flaxman may have been aware that reproductions of this group were available in Britain (for example, Spence 1747, dial. VIII, p. 1 1 1). Three studies after this group in a later section of the present sketch- book (ff. 69 r, 72r, 73 r) were with all likelihood made after a cast in Rome, as they are found together with studies of other works in that city. The Rome drawings also differ from those executed in Florence, exhibiting a faster and bolder technique, and also suggest that Flaxman profited from the higher contrasts provided by plaster casts (see f. 69 r). Until the end of the eighteenth century, the present sculpture in the group, now identified as Psyche , was consistendy seen as representing a daughter of Niobe (marble, 125 cm, Uffizi, inv. no. 30$; Mansuelli 1958-61, i (1958), pp. 122-23, cat. no. 84). The realization that another copy of this type, in the Museo Capitolino, was equipped with butterfly wings led to the discovery of a patch on the back of the present figure, suggesting that this too had been a figure of Psyche and mistakenly associated with the other figures of the group (Mansuelli 1958-61, i (1958), pp. 122-23, cat. no. 84; Geominy 1984, pp. 171-72). The identification of the figure solely as Psyche has been refuted by Geominy (1984, pp. 171-88), who argues convincingly that the present figure was at some point exchanged for another copy, now in the Museo Bardini in Florence, that originally belonged to the group and did not have wings. This suggests that in antiquity the same type was used without wings for a daughter of Niobe and with wings for the representation of Psyche. Flaxman studies the figure from below and behind so that the head is seen in profile. This flattens the figure and emphasizes the outline. The position of the right hand seems to have caused problems, as Flaxman had to revise it three times.

Flaxman made three drawings of this figure, one from the front and two from the sides. All are worked up to the same level and show extensive use of dark wash. Flaxman uses delicate tonal modelling to render the volume of this figure of a rather podgy young boy. Each view of the figure with its twisted pose presents the draughtsman with serious challenges.

The group was first described around 1550 in Rome in the house of Pietro de Radicibus. It was acquired by Ferdinand I after he had become Grand Duke and is first mentioned in the Uffizi in 1704 (Mansuelli as above, p. 159). It is represented in Gori (1737-43, m&gt; pi- 48). Flaxman (1829, p. 90) discusses it as a work by Praxiteles. In this drawing, the sculptor concentrated entirely on the group and omitted the base. Wash is used very sparingly and almost solely to contrast different levels of relief in areas of overlap, for example where Bacchus's left hand is drawn in front of his hip.

Flaxman first sketched out the composition in graphite. Then he retraced the outlines with pen and ink and indicated some of the areas of deep shade with dark wash. There is no further modelling of the figures through light wash. Thus, compared with the drawing after The Transfiguration (f. i8r), this sketch shows a much lower degree of finish and may in fact be considered unfinished. Flaxman reduced the dramatic gap that appears in the relief between Lazarus on the left and the group on the right, possibly to unify the composition. He retained, though, some of the gruesome, dark void that surrounds Lazarus. A similar void also appears where we look for the protagonist's face. The figures in the group on the right have been studied from different points of view to make each of them fully legible; Flaxman also realized the importance of the beautiful figure of Mary Magdalene in the foreground. Yet, he may have recognized his problems in translating Ghiberti's composition that was built on contrasting character delineation and dramatic tensions, into his own pictorial language characterized by simplicity of design and coherence of sentiment.

Flaxman's study records how Ghiberti's figurai composition makes full use of the quatrefoil format. The initial graphite sketch also includes the framework, but Flaxman chose later only to indicate the quatrefoil ground behind the standing figures of Moses, Christ and Elijah through the application of a light wash.

Maria Maggiore (Avery 1987, pp. 114-18 (esp. 117 on the original location), pls. 103, no, 115). In eighteenth-century guidebooks the work is repeatedly commented upon as a remarkable sculpture (Northall 1766, p. 100; Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 192-93; Martyn 1787, p. 331). It is now in the Loggia dei Lanzi. Flaxman made two drawings after the sculpture, both from the left-hand side. The present one was made from an oblique angle, slighdy from behind and at a distance of c. 6 m, the drawing on f. 2or obliquely from the front. The chosen viewpoint of the present drawing produces a relatively calm image. Three of the four arms are contained within the overall outline of the group, and both Hercules and the equestrian body of the centaur appear less distorted and fragmented than from most other viewpoints. The drawing capitalizes on the exciting interplay of the combatants' arms, legs, and weapons, from the centaur's front leg up to Hercules's club. Flaxman's technique stands in a strange contrast to the heroic and dramatic sculpture as his lines are particu- larly tentative, both in the preparatory sketch and the later fixing of the outlines in pen and ink. The ink lines frequendy deviate from the earlier graphite, indicating Flaxman's struggle with this sculpture.

The two drawings also have a higher degree of finish 128</page><page sequence="134">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK than the earlier ones; Flaxman may have considered them to be particularly successful. The present design records the third scene from the left in the doors' central tier (Krautheimer 1970, 11, pls. 18, 34). Flaxman depicts the straight groundstrip and the consoles that support it, but he does not indicate the quatrefoil shape of the picture field and its heavy frame. In the relief this frame has an important function as it impedes the vivid movement of the figures towards the right. The female figure on the very right is literally pressed against the frame, which forces her to turn around and change direction. Similarly, her neighbours seem about to move outward, towards the beholder. In Flaxman's drawing this sense of turmoil and change of direction is resolved, and the general flow to the right is only stopped by what appears as the figures' own reluctance to move on. Flaxman realizes the beauty of the figure of a semi-clad young man seated on the ground, that forms an elegant counterpoint to the figures above. Flaxman uses black wash to indicate the high relief of some of the figures and of the particularly complex architecture. He simplifies the latter to make it subservient to the figures before and below it.

Like the preceding study, this shows a high degree of finish and characterization of the individual figures. Only at the top, where in Ghiberti's relief the ship's rigging is artfully intertwined with the framework, does Flaxman record the quatrefoil shape of the latter. On the sides he extends the composition to a full square picture field and he takes liberties in the seemingly careful description of the rigging, to the point that he even omits any reference to the mast.

The study of the tomb of Giuliano in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 127, on the other hand, reflects Flaxman's specific interest in wall-mounted tombs at a time when he was thinking about the Mansfield monument (Whinney 1956, pp. 277-79). The second sketch in that volume is no more than an abbreviated reminder of the spatial relationship of the figure of Giuliano de' Medici and Day. 129</page><page sequence="135">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK This carefully finished general sketch records the overall composition of the tomb; the architecture is simplified.

In the eighteenth century it was the subject of great admiration and first identified by Maffei as an original by Polykleitos. During the course of the century this identification was increasingly questioned (marble, height 290 cm; Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 232-34, cat. no. 47 (esp. p. 233 for the reference to Maffei); Saladino 2003, pp. 53-55). Winckelmann (1764 (2006), p. 73) judged the group as ťan inferior work, over half of which has been restored'. The inscription in the present sketchbook apparendy repeats the traditional attribution and references to Pliny, but in his Lectures Flaxman (1829, pp. 95-96) voices a more critical opinion, suggesting that the group was a copy after a bronze original of Polykleitos. Flaxman chooses a frontal view and omits the plinth, referring only with a few hesitant strokes in graphite to the substantial support that rises behind the group up to Hercules's thighs. There are extensive pentimenti , documenting an initial struggle to position the image on the sheet (see, for example, the area to the left and below of Antaeus' s right arm). Problems persisted and there are many passages where the underdrawing has been changed and/or where the re-enforcing lines in graphite or pen and ink do not follow the underdrawing.

As the present drawing and the Fitzwilliam Journal confirm, it had returned to the Uffizi by 1787 (marble, height 75 cm, Florence, inv. no. 322; Mansuelli 1958-61, 1 (1958), pp. 96-97, cat. no. 63, pl. 60). Together with the drawings after two figures of Cupid in the same collection (ff. 2r and 4r as well as ff. I3r, I4r and I5r) this frontal study reflects a surprising interest by Flaxman in representations of the young and chubby male body.

Massima In December 1787 the Flaxmans continued their journey to Rome. The two sketches on this folio are the first ones in this sketchbook that depict Roman motifs. 1) (above) A Relief of six axes in fasces Inscribed in ink, below: a basreleif [sic] in the Wall The relief of six axes in fasces is still today displayed in the Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne inserted in the walls on the first landing of the main staircase (Matz and Duhn 1881-82, m (1882), p. 171, no. 3870; photograph Conway Library, London, neg.: Courtauld C35-1). It was first recorded in the Codex Pighianus (1547- 55; Jahn 1868, p. 186, no. 54). In the eighteenth century it was included in Tatham 1799, where the author reproduces what seems to be an abbreviated version with only three fasces, rather than a different object.

Cipriani, Nuovo metodo per apprendere insieme le teorie e le pratiche 131</page><page sequence="137">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK della scelta architettura civile sopra una nuova raccolta dei' più cospicui exempláři di Roma, Rome 1794 (cited after Wurm 1965) represents the relief in situ (reproduced in Wurm (1965, pl. i6a)). Flaxman does not record any of the damages to the relief that can be seen in modern photographic reproductions. In ancient Rome, the axes in the fasces were used for capital punishment and carried by the lictors behind the consuls as signs of the power of the state (Drummond in Oxford Classical Dictionary 199 6, pp. 587-88). As such, the display of this relief on the landing of the stairs to the piano nobile of an important Roman family's palace is similar to that of the relief representing spoils of war on the landing of the much grander staircase in the Altieri Palace, copied by Flaxman on f. 3or, study 2. These reliefs would have been of interest for Flaxman both from an antiquarian point of view and in regard to potential British patrons. As members of the leading elites, these patrons represented a power that aspired to be the successor of the Roman empire. 2) (below) A Roman throne for a god with wreath and dove This is a Roman marble throne, now in Munich in the Glypothek (marble, height 60 cm; Brunn 1887, p. 268, no. 277; Richter 1966, p. 99, fig. 483). It is similar to the one from the Mattei collection, studied by Flaxman in f. 3 or, study 1. Like that object, it had originally a back rest that apparendy was already broken off when Flaxman copied the seat. The wreath and dove on top of the seat are missing in modern photographs and it is unclear whether Flaxman recorded what was still there or reconstructed what was missing. Brunn (1887, p. 268, cat. no. 277) recognizes traces of a bird's feet, a round object, and of a bow that he tentatively relates to Apollo or Diana. Winckelmann in his notes (2003, p. 35, 11. 12-13, P- 231) describes the throne as positioned in the loggia of the palazzo. //f. 29V [unused] Rome, Palazzo Mattei and Palazzo Altieri //f. 30r [B1975. 3.468(00)] (Fig. 31) after ancient sculpture Two studies Graphite, pen and ink, and wash 1) (above) A Roman throne for a god with sword and wreath Inscribed in ink on verso, u. r.: Pallazzo [sic] Mattei This seat is mentioned and reproduced in Venuti and Emaduzzi (1779, 11, p. 94, pl. 73, fig. 2). It is now in the Antikensammlung in Munich (marble, height 59 cm; Brunn 1887, pp. 262-63, cat. no. 262; Richter 1966, p. 99, fig. 483). Like the similar object depicted in f. 29r, study 2, this one had originally a back rest which in this case was worked separately (Brunn 1887, pp. 262-63, cat. no. 262). It was apparendy already missing when Flaxman drew the object. The modern literature describes the throne without the sword and wreath. It cannot be determined whether Flaxman saw these elements or reconstructed them in his drawing. Brunn (1887, p. 262, cat. no. 262) tried to establish the missing decoration and suggested that the missing sword may indicate a connection to the cult of Mars. Winckelmanii in his personal notes (2003, p. 24, 11. 19-20, p. 214) describes the throne as standing on a landing in the palace. 2) (below) A relief of spoils of war Inscribed in ink on verso, 1. r.: P: Altieri The monumental relief of Roman trophies or spoils of war is still in situ in the Palazzo Altieri, where it is inserted on the first landing of the monumental staircase (Borsi et al. 1991, p. 72). This display is similar to that of the relief from the Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne copied by Flaxman in f. 29r, study 1. Both reliefs would have had a similar appeal to their Roman sixteenth-century and British eighteenth-century audiences (see the discussion of f. 29r above). Flaxman only records the classical relief and omits the modern frame and crest above it. 132</page><page sequence="138">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK //f. 30V [inscribed as mentioned above] (Fig- 1) Location of source unknown //f. 3ir [Bi975 3.468(dd)] (Fig. 1) after ancient relief sculpture? Figure in a long cloak Graphite The subject matter, let alone source, of this study is very difficult to identify. A figure in a long mantle is standing in profile to left, the arms are hanging down with the hands joined before the lower abdomen. While hardly visible, the drawing is instructive for Flaxman's technique, it represents the very first stage of his sketching process. Only the most basic contour of the figure has been established with a series of very fine and tentative, mostly short graphite marks. This hesitant process does not produce an outline, but rather what one might call an 'area of outline' into which Flaxman would later insert the final outline using pen and ink. //f. 31V [unused] Rome, Vatican Museum (Gabinetto delle Maschere) //f. 32r [Bi975.3.468(ee)] (Fig. 32) after ancient sculpture Crouching Venus Graphite Lit.: Irwin 1979, p. 43 This and the following drawing are studies of the Vatican version of the Crouching Venus , not of the Florentine one, as previously assumed (see f. 33r). In this faint graphite study the sculpture is seen from the left-hand side. Flaxman has only completed the initial light and tentative graphite drawing, establishing the main contour and features of the figure. Yet, it is possible to discern one distinct detail of the Vatican copy, namely the position of the right lower arm, which can just be made out beneath the figure's chin. In the Florentine version the lower arm is not raised as high as this, and would consequently not be visible from the chosen viewpoint. For a more detailed discussion, and literature on the different versions of the Crouching Venus , see this sketchbook, f. 33r- //f. 32V [unused] //{. 33r [Bi975.3.468(fi)l (Fig. 33) after ancient sculpture Crouching Venus Graphite Lit.: Irwin 1979, p. 43 Previously misidentified, the model for this and the preceding drawing is not the famous Florentine version of the Crouching Venus but the one in the Vatican that reached the collection in the mid-eighteenth century (marble, height 82 cm; Amelung and Lippold 1903-56, 11 (1908), pp. 680-84, cat. no. 427; Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 323, cat. no. 86). Distinctive features of this version that are reflected in the drawing are the higher position of the right lower arm and hand, with its more rhetorical hand gesture, the absence of an armband on the right upper arm, the splayed out fingers of the left hand and, finally, the more classical profile as opposed to the softer features and fleshy mouth of the Florentine copy (on the various copies, see Lullies 1954; Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 321-323, cat. no. 86; Kansteiner, Kuhn-Forte and Krause in Winckelmann 2003, p. 353). Northall (1766, p. 344) and Winckelmann (2003, p. 82) mention the Medici copy when it was still in the gallery of the Villa Medici at Rome, Winckelmann also offers a devastating judgement on the mouth of that copy (see above): das Maul machet eine grimace. According to documentary evidence the Medici copy was inspected in 1787 for transferrai to Florence during that year, but this may have happened late in the year or in 1788 (Mansuelli 1958-61, 1 (1958), p. 83, cat. no. 54; Documenti inediti 1878-80, iv, 1880, p. 80, cf. f. 54r). 133</page><page sequence="139">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK For the first time in this sketchbook, Flaxman employs a quicker drawing technique. As in the preceding sketch he uses a thicker and softer graphite, fixing the outlines more swiftly with longer and broader, yet faint marks. Instead of pen and ink and wash he now uses graphite to fix the contour and achieves tonal modelling through parallel hatching in the same medium. //f. 33V [unused] Rome, Villa Medici (Gardens) //£. 34 r [Bi975.3.468(gg)] (Fig. 34) after ancient sculpture Roma Graphite, pen and ink, and wash Inscribed in ink on verso, u. r.: Gardens of Villa Medicis as it sits about 12 f:( high This is a frontal study of the colossal statue of the goddess Roma in the gardens of the Villa Medici (marble, height 350 cm; Matz and Duhn 1881-82, 1 (1881), p. 174, cat. no. 661; Cagiano de Azevedo 1951, p. 89, cat. no. 142; pl. 40). The figure is strongly restored; the head, right arm with orb, left hand and left foot are modern. Matz and Duhn argue that this may have been the monumental sculpture of the Goddess Roma that was found on the Monte Cavallo and bought by Cardinal d'Este for his gardens on the Quirinal. It was given by Gregory XIII to Cardinal de' Medici. Flaxman' s rendering of the helmet differs from the twentieth- century appearance of the sculpture (Chastel 1989-91, 1 (1989), fig. 274), but it is in agreement with other eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century drawings of the sculpture (for example, the view by Jean-Jacques Pradier, c . 1814-18; Chastel 1989-91, 1 (1989), fig. 52). Untypically, Flaxman in this drawing uses wash to describe the fall of light rather than solely to indicate depth of relief. A faint additional sketch in the top left-hand corner depicts what appears to be the same figure. //f. 34V [inscribed as mentioned above] //f. 35r [Bi975.3.468(hh)] (Fig. 35) after ancient relief [?] sculpture Dancing Maenade with Thyrsus and Small Amphora Graphite, pen and ink Inscribed in graphite, 1. r.: Vil[la] Medici A Maenade is dancing in profile to the left with a thyrsus in her right and a small amphora in her left hand. The figure derives possibly from a Bacchic sarcophagus relief or an ancient vase. Despite Flaxman's identification of the location, the source for Flaxman's drawing remains unidentified. //f. 35V [unused] Outside Rome, Villa Doria Pamphilij //f. 3ór [Bi975.3.468(ii)] (Fig- 36) after ancient roman sarcophagus relief The Judgment of Paris Graphite, pen and ink, and wash (image turned 900 clockwise) Inscribed in ink, 1. 1.: Fit [lia] Doria 2 miles out of Rome This badly damaged sarcophagus front was recorded in the fifteenth century in the church of S. Maria in Monterone and transferred in the sixteenth century into the house of Girolamo Frangipani behind S. Maria in Via (60 X 210 cm, second century ad; Robert in ASR, 11 (1890), pp. 11-13, cat. no. 10, pl.

In 1664 it was inserted into the north façade of the Casino Belrespiro of the Villa Doria Pamphilij, where it remains still in situ. Bober and Rubinstein list thirteen representations, including prints, from the Renaissance alone, and Flaxman may well have known the composition before his encounter with the original. 134</page><page sequence="140">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK Paris is seated at the centre of the composition; before him stands Mercury whose caduceus is partly lost in the badly damaged relief and entirely omitted by Flaxman. Venus and Cupid appear next to him, she holds the sceptre. Her right hand, lost in the original, may have held the apple, but Flaxman reconstructs it as reaching down towards Cupid/an eros. Torso and feet of another eros to the right of Venus are recorded in a drawing by Giovannantonio Dosio (late sixteenth to early seventeenth century; Hülsen 1933, p. 6, f. 8, no. 20, pl. 10). In the relief a restorer has since filled this gap with an amphora (Bonanno in Calza et al. 1977, p. 164). Flaxman, who records the relief as if it was undamaged, leaves this space empty, which could suggest that his drawing predates the restoration. On the right-hand side are Hera and Athena and behind them Tellus with a cornucopia . Above him, barely legible in the original sarcophagus and only roughly indicated by Flaxman, appears a group of three figures on a mountain. A group of nymphs on the left complete the composition. Flaxman' s own representation of the Judgment of Paris repeats some of the iconographie elements, but no actual motifs of this relief (Flaxman 1870, Mad , pl. 37). //f. 36V [unused] Location unknown //£. 37r [Bi975.3.468(jj)] (Fig. 37) after ancient relief Centaur with Lyre and Cupid Graphite (image turned 90o clockwise) This Bacchic motif, variations of which can also be found on sarcophagus reliefs and elsewhere, is inscribed into an oval composition that suggests that the unidentified model may have been a gem; see, for example, the similar design of a collapsing centaur on a gem in New York (Zierlein-Diehl 2007, p. 392, pl. 80, fig. 343). Flaxman seems to have experimented on this sheet with an (originally colourless?) fixant, possibly shellac (it is fluorescent under ultraviolet light), which has since turned yellow. Applied while the page was held up, the substance has run into the spine and also stained the following folio. (I should like to thank Theresa Fairbanks, paper Chief Conservator at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven Connecticut for technical analysis and advice.) //f. 37V [unused] Rome, Palazzo Mattei //f. 38r [Bi975.3.468(kk)] (Fig. 38) after ancient sarcophagus relief Mars Rhea Sarcophagus: det., Jupiter, Victory and a River-God Graphite This quick sketch records the bottom left-hand corner of a well-known sarcophagus that is inserted high up in the walls of the courtyard of the Palazzo Mattei (marble, 93 x 240 cm; Robert in ASR, in, 2, pp. 233-35, no. 190; Guerrini 1982, pp. 212-13, no. 60, pl. 63). The highly restored relief was published in a number of eighteenth-century sources (for example, Venuti and Emaduzzi 1779, m, pl. 33; and Spence 1747, dial. VI, pl. 9). It was again reproduced and discussed by Winckelmann (1767 (1821), 11, pp. 145-51, no. no), who identified it as Peleas and Thetis and criticized the inaccuracy of the engraving in Spence's publication. Eighteenth-century guidebooks, including Lalande (1786, v, p. 284), expressed reservations about the Mattei collection as many of its objects were considered largely modern restorations. The present sarcophagus is indeed badly damaged and its lower part largely modern. At the centre of the relief Mars appears to the sleep- ing nymph Rhea Silvia. The Roman gods are gathering above and to either side of the scene (Robert in ASR, in, 2 (1904), pp. 228-32). The group that Flaxman picks out consists of three original figures at the left-hand side. According to modern archaeological literature these are Jupiter on his throne, behind him Victory and to his feet a river-god. The restorers had turned Jupiter's large sceptre into an oar, thus making him a marine deity. This interpretation is in fact propagated by Winckelmann (1767 (1821), 11, p. 146). Flaxman includes the detail and will have read the group in a similar way. 135</page><page sequence="141">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK Flaxman loosely based a group on the left-hand side of his Minerva Repressing the Fury of Achilles on the present composition (Flaxman, Iliad , 1870, pl. 2; reproduced in Irwin 1979, p. 69, fig. 83). //f. 38V [unused] Rome, Palazzo Mattei Paganica //f. 39r [B1975. 3.468(H)] (Fig. 39) after fragment of ancient sarcophagus relief The Rape of Proserpina, det.: Pluto carrying Proserpina Graphite (image turned 900 clockwise) Flaxman copies the group of Pluto raping Proserpina from a small ancient fragment of a Proserpina relief that had been restored to form a 'scene of batde and murder' (Robert as below) and is held in the small Palazzo Mattei, also known as the Palazzo Paganica (50 x 43 cm, middle of the second century ad; Robert in ASR, in, 3 (1919), p. 490, cat. no. 411, pl. 129, fig. 411). The drawing focuses on the figure of Pluto, but it includes the entire ancient fragment and a figure on the right as well as the body of Minerva on the left that are both modern additions. Flaxman would later copy an intact Proserpina relief (V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. I9r). As this was in the nearby Palazzo Mattei, where he had worked before (this sketchbook, f. 38r), it seems probable that he may have recognized the original context and subject of the present detail. In his Lectures, Flaxman would categorize 4 the bas relief [. . .] of the rape ofProserpine' as a 'Grecian' composition (Flaxman 1829, p. 185). This suggests that Flaxman saw the different reliefs as copies after a Greek original. //f. 39V [unused] Rome, Palazzo Naro //f. 40r [Bl975.3.468(mm)] (Fig. 40) after ancient sarcophagus relief Bacchic Scene Graphite, pen and ink, and wash (image turned 900 clockwise) Inscribed in ink, u. r.: Palace of Marquis Nari Rome Inscribed in graphite, 1. r.: Nare The Nari family (also known as Naro or de Naro), Marquesses of Monpeo, Paganica, Castel Giuliano and Sasso, lived in the seventeenth-century Palazzo Naro in Piazza Campomarzio (Callari 1944, pp. 472-73). The identification of the object of this study presents difficulties. A young man sits on a rocky ground, with a nude woman behind him. A small-scale figure, presumably a satyr, reaches up from below towards the hand of the seated man, and in the bottom right-hand corner appears an animal facing left. A very similar (identical?) relief entered the Museo Nazionale Romano as part of the former Ludovisi collection (white marble, 49 x 78cm; Giuliano i979~95&gt; !» 6 (1986), pp. 273-76, cat. no. VIII, 25). A modern restoration expanded the composition with two standing figures on the left-hand side, but the right-hand side, though also intensively restored, corresponds to Flaxman's scene, though with some crucial differences. Rather than depicting a man and a woman, the relief represents an old and a young man, Silenus and Dionysus, seated on rocky ground, and the panther in the bottom right-hand corner faces to the right rather than the left. Signs of breakage in the relief indicate that the heads and arms may be modern additions. A drawing in the Codex Coburgensis represents yet another relief, the current whereabouts of which are not known. Here the same all-male group is inserted into a wider Bacchic landscape, with limbs and heads broken off the main figures, but the purpose of the satyr's gesture - unclear from the Flaxman study - is apparent in the Codex, as the satyr passes Silenus a bunch of grapes. The drawing dates before 1555 (Matz 1871, p. 468, no. 39 (138); see also Giuliano 1979-95, 1» 6 (1986), pp. 275-76, no. VIII, 25). What Flaxman was looking at was most likely the result of the restoration of a relief that was similar to that in the Ludovisi collection and equally damaged. The restorer of the work in the Nari collection seems to have reworked the youthful, soft body of Dionysos, turning it into that of a woman and giving the other body the 136</page><page sequence="142">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK head of a young man and a club. When drawing the figures Flaxman may have added his part by shaping the male and female bodies according to his expectations. We can only speculate what he believed the scene to represent. Most likely, Flaxman would have understood this as a Bacchic scene with the god of wine at its centre, but the club together with the scale of the male body (compared with that of the satyr) may also have evoked a reading as Hercules and Omphale. Rome, Church of SS.

Apostoli in Rome (second century ad; Bober and Rubinstein 1986, pp. 219-20, cat. no. 186). As in similar cases (ff. 29r and 3 or), Flaxman omits any modern additions to the ancient relief, in this case the inscription that commemorates the actions of the Renaissance Pope. The relief was frequendy copied in the Renaissance (Bober and Rubinstein 1986, no. 186, pp. 219-20). It is also reproduced in Tatham 1799. //f. 41V [inscribed as mentioned above] Rome, Palazzo Lancellotti //f. 42r [01975.3.468(00)] (Fig. 42) after ancient sculpture A seated woman Graphite, pen and ink, and wash The sculpture that Flaxman studied in this drawing was at that time in the Palazzo Lancellotti in Rome. It is now in the Museo Civico at Vicenza (Greek marble; 17$ cm height; copy of a Hellenistic original; Galliazzo 1976, pp. 68-73, cat. no. 17; Liverani 2000, pp. 346-48). An early eighteenth-century source mentions two sculptures of seated women, described as having similar dress but different heads, displayed at the top of the staircase in the Palazzo Lancellotti (Eton College, Topham Catalogue, f. 51; Liverani 2000, p. 347 n. 25). In 1779, eight years before Flaxman's arrival in Rome, one of these had been acquired by the Museo Pio Clementino to join the group of Apollo and the Muses that had been excavated in 1774 in the Villa di Cassio. This is the so-called Euterpe still on display in the Sala delle Muse in the Vatican (Lippold in Amelung and Lippold 1903-56, in, i (1936), pp. 75-78; cat. no. 520, pls. 9-10). In exchange, the Palazzo Lancellotti received another similar sculpture of lesser quality that had formed part of the group excavated at the Villa di Cassio (Liverani 2000, p. 347; Piva 2007, pp. 104-06). Subsequently, in 1807, this and the second sculpture from the Lancellotti collection were bought by the Vatican after the Vatican's own Muses had been sent to Paris by Napoleon. When these returned from France, the two replacements were removed from the Sala delle Muse. In 1827 the present sculpture was given to Girolamo Egidio, Count of Velo who later donated it to the city of Vicenza; the other remained in the Vatican and is now on display in the Casino of Pius IV in the Vatican Gardens (Amelung and Lippold 1903-56, m, 1 (1936), pp. 34~36, cat. no. 505, pl. 4; Liverani 2000, pp. 347-48). The sculpture in Vicenza is extremely close to the Vatican Euterpe and it is therefore likely that these were the two sculptures originally paired up on top of the staircase of the Palazzo Lancellotti. A drawing from the collection of Cassiano dal Pozzo provides the earliest record of one of these two sculptures (before 1657; Windsor IX, f. 18, no. 8801; Vermeide 1966, p. 56). It appears to depict the Vatican Euterpe . Flaxman in his Lectures also mentions the Muses in the Vatican and casts after them in the council room of the Royal Academy (Flaxman 1829, pp. 281-82). 137</page><page sequence="143">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK //f. 42V [unused] Location unknown //f. 43r [Bi975*3.468(pp)] (Fig- 43) after unidentified ancient sculpture Female figure striding forward holding a wreath (Victory?) Graphite, pen and ink There are many ancient sculptures in Roman collections that closely resemble the statue studied by Flaxman in this drawing and f. 44r, study i, but the precise model is difficult to establish. Flaxman may have interpreted the figure as Victory, as she is striding forward and bearing a wreath in her outstretched arm. Arm and wreath are likely to be modern additions and the figure's original identity cannot be clearly defined. Flaxman was obviously attracted by the elegant and upright pose of the figure and its agitated drapery. The two drawings would have enabled him to understand the figure in its three dimensions. //f. 43v [unused] //f. 44r [Bl975-3-468(qq)] (Fig. 44) Two studies after ancient Roman sculpture 1) Female figure striding forward holding a wreath (Victory?) 2) Female figure striding forward Graphite (image turned 900 clockwise) Both studies are only rough graphite sketches. Study 1 is another view of the same figure as f. 43 r. Its purpose as an additional sketch was to record the pose and drapery of the figure as seen from the front and this might explain why Flaxman did not work it up. Study 2, on the right-hand side, holds even less information. It shows a female figure in a similar stance, the hands drawn towards the body, holding the folds of the chiton over the hips. The type is common, but the exact model is difficult to establish. For a similar sculpture, though with a different stance, see the Hour in the Uffizi (inv. no. 137; Mansuelli 1958-61, 1 (1958), pp. 153-54, cat. no. 124, pl. 120). //f. 44V [unused] Rome, Piazza Montecitorio //f. 45r [81975.3.468(1?)] (Fig. 45) after ancient Roman relief sculpture The Apotheosis of Antoninus Pius and Faustina Graphite, pen and ink, and wash (image turned 900 clockwise) This and the following drawing are studies after reliefs from the pedestal of the column of Antoninus Pius (after 161 ad; marble, 247 x 338 cm; Amelung in Amelung and Lippold 1903-56, 1 (1903), pp. 883-93, cat. no. 223, pls. 216-18; Vogel 1973). Erected in the Campus Martius, the column remained in situ and visible throughout the Middle Ages. Still, the name of the emperor whom it commemorated was only revealed when the pedestal was excavated in 1703. In 1705 column and pedestal were separated. The column was eventually damaged and reused for other purposes, but the pedestal was restored and stood in the Piazza Montecitorio from the early 1740s until its removal to the Vatican's Giardino della Pigna in autumn 1789 (Vogel 1973, pp. 5-6). Given the chronology of the present sketchbook, it is most likely that Flaxman studied the reliefs in Piazza Montecitorio. Since its excavation the monument has repeatedly been published. The earliest publications are Bianchini 1703, Vignoli 1705 and Piranesi 1762; the illustrations have been reproduced by Vogel (1973, pls. 25-26 (Bianchini), 27-31 (Vignoli), 32-37 (Piranesi)). See also the description of the monument in Lalande 1769, in, pp. 630-33.

It depicts the submission of Barbarians under a Roman general. The general is seated in profile to the right, behind him stands a group of Roman soldiers, from the right he is approached by the Barbarians; two men in Phrygian caps and a woman with open hair and loose garment push a boy towards the general. The scene is overlooked from the left by a soldier; behind him stand another captive and two more soldiers. The relief was published in the eighteenth century by Venuti and Emaduzzi (1779, in, tav.

Inscribed in ink (1. 1.): Villa Borghese This fragment from a Hippolytus sarcophagus was inserted into the northern façade of the Villa Borghese presumably at the time of its construction in 1615. In 1807 it came to the Louvre and is now in the museum store (marble, 82 x 32 cm, c. 225-50 ad, inv. no.: Ma 592; Robert in ASR, in, 2 (1890), p. 181, cat. no. 153; Rogge in ASR, ix, 1, 1 (1995), p. 153, cat. no. 61, pl. 100, 2). The fragment depicts two young women with a string instrument who in their original context would have attended Hippolytus's stepmother, Phaedra, with her wetnurse in her room. In Flaxman's days the fragment formed part of a very heterogeneous pastiche, that juxtaposed them with an disproportionately tall putto who offered them fruit.

Flaxman isolates the figures from this context, indicating that he recognized the heterogeneous character of the modern ensemble. 2) (r.) Seated Hero, called Mars Graphite This sculpture of a warrior resting on the ground belonged to the Ludovisi collection and entered the Museo Nazionale Romano (Palazzo Altemps) in 1901 (Greek marble, height 93 cm, Hellenistic, inv. no. 8603; Schreiber 1880, p. 139-40, cat. no. 118; Palma in Giuliano 1979-95, h 5 (1983), pp. 167-70, cat. no. 71). It is briefly described by Winckelmann (2003, p. 112) in his personal notes. Flaxman mentions and sketches the sculpture in the Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 25r, and referred to it by the present tide. The drawing on this folio only records the outlines of the figure. There are a few pentimenti around the crown of the head.

Other versions of the group exist, e.g., in the Museo dei Conservatori (Palma in Giuliano 1979-95, 1, 5 (1983), p. 79). The sculpture was copied for Pichard Topham (before 1730; Tophamianus Eton, vol. Bmi2, f. 119 (Batoni)). Winckelmann mentions the group in his personal notes (2003, p. 112, 11. 25-29); his observations on the modern restorations agree with Flaxman's. On this folio Flaxman makes two careful studies of the work, one from the front, the other from the left- hand side. The second sketch contains drastic pentimenti: the initial graphite underdrawing positioned the satyr about i cm higher up on the sheet. Apparendy, Flaxman had started the figure before he realized that he would not have enough space for the head of the nymph. The interest in the group, documented by Flaxman's set of two relatively highly worked up drawings, is significant in relation to his later group of Hercules and Hebe (Irwin 1979, p. 59, fig- 74).

Maria in Aracoeli (marble, 66 X 220 cm, first half third century ad; Rumpf in ASR, v, 1 (1939) pp. 45-46, cat. no. 1 16, pl. 40). There it was drawn by an anonymous fifteenth-century artist (London, BM, 1946-7-13-2*^). It was regularly copied during the Renaissance (Codex Wolfegg, f. 29v/3or (c. 1500); Schweikhart 1986, fig. 13, also reproduced in Rumpf as above fig. 68); Codex Coburgensis (before 1555; Matz 1871, p. 488, no. 176, f. 69); drawing from Cassiano dal Pozzo's collection (before 1657; Windsor, vi, f. 49, no. 8602; Vermeide 1966, p. 41)). By the eighteenth century it had entered the Palazzo Lancellotti. Between 1834 and 1842 it was moved to the Vatican (Bober and Rubinstein 1986, p. 131, cat. no. 99; Krautheimer 1970, Appendix A no. 25). The relief is badly damaged, very litde original surface remains intact, almost all heads are illegible. The most striking aspect of the composition is the centrally positioned group of Neptune and his quadriga who are shown fřontally. Between the waves created by this group appear dolphins and amoretti; two tritons appear to the sides. They are bearing nereides and amoretti on their tails. One of the nereides on the right-hand side is shown fřontally. As Neptune looks in her direction she may be identified as Amphitrite (Rumpf as above). There is a more highly finished drawing after this relief in the V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 5ir. In his own work Flaxman has used the central composition with the four horses fanning out to the sides for his Neptune Rising from the Sea , where the figure of the God is fully armed and seated (Flaxman, Mad , 1870, pl. 22). See V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 5ir. //f. 5IV [unused] Rome, Palazzo Barberini //f. 52r [Bi975.3.468(yy)] (Fig. 52) after ancient Roman sculpture Ceres Graphite, pen and Ink, and wash This over life-size statue of a woman stands in the second niche on the right in the monumental courtyard of the Palazzo Barberini. The identification as Ceres is based on the restored right and lower left arms (Matz and Duhn 1881-82, il (1881), pp. 403-03, cat. no. 1394; Magnanimi 1983, p. 136). Although the rendering of the drapery in Flaxman's design does not follow the original in every detail, the major emphasis of the drawing lies on the reproduction of pose and drapery of the figure. //£. 52V [unused] //£. 53r [Bl975-3.468(zz)] (Fig. 53) after ancient Greek funerary relief A woman in profile to right standing before a seated woman Graphite and chalk (image turned 900 clockwise) Located in the Palazzo Barberini at the bottom of the left-hand side staircase, the Greek funerary relief welcomes the visitor who enters the Palazzo via this entrance (Matz and Duhn 1881-82, m (1882), p. 132, cat. no. 3729; the authors praise the quality of this work). The baroque restorer Giuseppe Giorgetti added the lost head of the standing figure on the left-hand side and a large tree to the right of the seated figure (Magnanimi 1983, p. 130). Flaxman reproduces the ancient relief and, of the modern restorations, he includes only the above-mentioned head of the standing woman. He indicates in graphite the margins of the original 141</page><page sequence="147">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK fragment. Pentimenti above the head of the seated woman indicate that initially he had positioned her consi- derably higher on the page, which would not have allowed him to fit in the standing figure. The Irish painter Henry Tresham drew the relief with its modern additions (1775 to 1789; Robert 1897, p. 48, no. 222; a photographic reproduction exists in the Fototeca of the Kunsthistorisches Institut, Florence). //f. 53V [unused] Rome, Villa Medici //£. 54T [Bi975.3.468(aaa)] (Fig. 54) after ancient sculpture Apollo with the lyre Graphite The drawing depicts a sculpture of Apollo with his hand resting on a lyre. The statue is documented in the Florentine Palazzo Vecchio since the nineteenth century (Diitschke 1874-82, 11 (187$), p. 238, cat. no. 512; Amelung 1897, p. 2, cat. no. 2; Francini 2006, p. 284, fig. 1). It has been convincingly identified by Heikamp (1980, p. 217) as the 'Apollo with the lyre [. . .]' that, according to Roman documents, was examined in 1787 for transfer to Florence (Documenti inediti 1878-80, iv (1880), p. 79, no. 62). The position of the present drawing in Flaxman's sketchbook suggests strongly that Flaxman copied the statue in Rome. It seems therefore that the sculptures mentioned in the document from 1787 were either transferred very late in the year or, more likely, after the winter season in 1788. Mansuelli provides a similarly cautious interpretation of the relevant document in relation to the Crouching Venus that formed part of the same transfer of sculptures (Mansuelli 1958-61, i (1958), p. 83 n. 54). Flaxman refers to a transferrai of sculptures from the Villa to Florence in a letter of 25 May 1788 to John Romney (Constable 1927, p. 33). //f. 54V [unused] Rome, Palazzo Lancelotti //f. 55r [Bi975.3.468(bbb)] (Fig- 55) after ancient Roman sarcophagus relief Story of Medea Graphite (image turned 900 clockwise) This is a very quick sketch recording the basic composition of the right-hand side of a Medea relief, focusing on the climax of the cruel tale. Medea reliefs were already known and copied in Renaissance Rome (Bober and Rubinstein 1986, pp. 141-42, n. no; Wright 2005, p. 446, n. 22). The present relief derives from a sarcophagus lid and is now in the Vatican (31 x 193 cm; Robert in ASR, 11 (1890), cat. no. 194, pp. 206-09; Kaschnitz- Weinberg 1937, p. 214, cat. no. 473). The composition was first documented through a lost drawing of its left-hand side, possibly from Cassiano dal Pozzo's collection, that was later in the Albani collection (Robert in ASR, 11 (1890), p. 206). In the seventeenth century the relief was inserted into the walls of the courtyard of the Palazzo Lancellotti. Winckelmann 1767 (1821) published the above-mentioned drawing as no. 90 and commissioned an additional drawing of the right-hand side which he published as no. 91. In the nineteenth century the relief was transferred to the Vatican (Robert in ASR, 11 (1890), p. 206). By 1937 it was in the Vatican stores (Kaschnitz Weinberg 1937, p. 214). This sketch from Flaxman's early sojourn in Rome is only a brief record of the basic outlines of the right-hand side of the composition. Flaxman depicts the events from the Death of Creusa on the left to Medea's departure on a dragon drawn chariot on the right. The central scene shows Medea in a palaestra with her sword drawn, about to kill her two sons. Later, Flaxman was to make a more detailed drawing of the same relief (V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 2ir), and a similarly worked-up study of another Medea relief in the Palazzo Caucci (V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, ff. 22v and 23r). 142</page><page sequence="148">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK //f. 55V [unused] Rome, Palazzo Giustiniani //f. 5ór [Bi975.3.468(ccc)] (Fig. 56) after ancient sculpture Minerva Graphite The head with a helmet that turns this figure into a Minerva may not be original (Amelung and Lippold 1903-56, i (1903), pp. 10-11; Rizzo 1905, pp. 67-69, cat. no. 9, fig. 15). The figure was published mirror reversed in Sandrart 163 1- ?, 1, pl. 123. The present whereabouts are unknown to the compiler.

On the left-hand side appears Atalanta in profile to the right as she aims at the boar with her bow. In the centre of the composi- tion the animal, next to a tree, breaks out of its cave and is attacked by two hunters; a third man is lying on the ground. Flaxman's depiction of the scene differs from the fragment as it extends the image beyond the surviving evidence at the top right and bottom left-hand corner. Rather than having added these parts to form a rectangular composition, Flaxman may have copied the fragment in a modern relief context, concentrating only on what he believed to be an ancient fragment. For a precedent for such a discerning approach, see this sketchbook, f. 48r, study 1, or f. 39r. //f. 57V [unused] Rome, Villa Medici (garden façade) //f. 58r [Bl975.3.468(eee)] (Fig. 58) after ancient Roman sarcophagus relief Hercules fighting the Lion 9 det. Graphite (image turned 900 clockwise) This relief is inserted high up in the garden façade of the Villa Medici. It consists of an ancient relief fragment completed with stucco to form a rectangular field (Chastel 1989, 1, p. 304, fig. 474). A careful drawing of the fragment without its modern additions was made when the work still belonged to the della Valle collection and can be found in the Codex Pighianus (1547- 55; Jahn 1868, p. 187, no. 56, f. 33). Together with other works from the della Valle collection, the relief was acquired by the Medici in 1584 and soon afterwards built into the façade. Flaxman only draws the original fragment with the figure of Hercules, concentrating particularly on the musculature of the athletic back. //f. 58V [unused] Location unknown //f. 59r [Bi975.3.468(ffi)] (Fig. 59) Two studies after ancient sculpture Graphite and chalk (image turned 90°clockwise) 143</page><page sequence="149">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK Study i A Roman tragic mask Many Roman masks of this type survive in various Roman collections. Flaxman's studies after ancient or modern works are generally very close to their models in their outlines, so that even faint initial sketches of figures and relief compositions can be identified beyond doubt. Yet, his accuracy does not extend to details, such as hair or drapery. A firm identification of the model for this drawing is therefore impossible, but if an identification should be attempted, the large tragic mask from the garden façade of the Villa Medici would be a very plausible candidate (Cagiano de Azevedo 1951, p. 55» no- 43; Chastel 1989-91, 1 (1989)» pi- 476).

Study 2 A male head This head seems to be a work of the second century ad and it could be a portrait of Antinous whose main portrait type it resembles (Meyer 1991, pp. 20-23 and passim). Similarities are the roundness of the face, the slightly opened, fleshy mouth and the generally bold features. The hair does not correspond to the usual arrangement of the locks of this type.

However, under Pope Sixtus V, between 1589 and 1591, they had been restored and put on pedestals, and under Pius VI in 1783, only a few years before Flaxman's visit, they had been moved again into their present position. They had been extensively copied, studied and discussed by artists and antiquarians since the late Middle Ages, partly because of their inscriptions that attribute the left-hand one to Phidias and the right-hand one to Praxiteles (Thielemann 1993; Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 136-41, cat. no. 3). Around the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century the human figures of the group received great attention (Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 139). The interest in the figures, as opposed to the horses, and the preference for the supposedly Phidian, left-hand, Horse Tamer is reiterated by Martyn (1787, p. 218) and shared by Flaxman. In the present sketchbook he made one drawing of each of the two figures, but the six later studies in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937 are exclusively of the Phidian figure. In his later Lectures Flaxman (1829, pp. 93, 278-79) would also accept the attributions and favour the left-hand group just because of its attribution to Phidias. The motif of the alert male nude occurs frequently in Flaxman's illustrations and, while direct copies of the Horse Tamers are rare, many poses are clearly related. The present study only consists of outlines. Internal modelling and the indication of surface or volume are minimal. Drawing the sculpture from the left, Flaxman shows the torso frontally with the head turned into profile to the right. The horse (on the right), spoils of war (on the left) and cloth (behind the proper left leg) are only roughly indicated in the faint initial drawing. Flaxman gives an overall record of the sculpture, but the main purpose of the drawing is to provide a model for figures that are striding forward in an attack.

He has drawn the figure from c. 1 8 m distance, as far away as necessary to get a substantial view of the figure's back. Like the previous drawing, this is a pure outline drawing, but it is a very brief and incomplete sketch. Flaxman reinforces the outlines with graphite, thus fixing the rather minimalist drawing; the horse and supporting garment and spoliae are hardly marked.

Ó2r [B 1 975 . 3 .468 (iii)] (Fig. 62) after ancient sculpture Aspasia / Priestess Graphite Inscribed in graphite on verso: Palace Guistiniani [sic] Flaxman's model for this drawing can be identified beyond doubt through an engraving in Clarac and the description in the 1905 catalogue of the Giustiniani collection (Clarac 1826-53, iii (1850), p. 286, cat. no. 1092C, pl. 506A; Matz and Duhn 1881-82, 1 (1881), p. 417, cat. no. 1448; Rizzo 1905, pp. 77-78, cat. no. 13; two other copies of the type, also from the Giustiniani collection, are now in the Museo Capitolino, Stuart Jones 1912, p. 30, no. 12 and p. 32, no. 22). A drawing by Dosio labels the figure Mnemosyne (late sixteenth to early seventeenth century; Hülsen 1933, p. 31, no. 155, b, f. 66v). Winckelmann ((1767), 1821, 1, pp. LXVI-LXVII) discusses the sculpture as an example of the style before Phidias and rejects what he describes as its common identification as a Vestal Virgin. In the nineteenth century Clarac identifies the figure as Polyhymnia and later suggestions include Europa , Aspasia , Sosandra or simply Amelung's Goddess after the German archaeologist who identified the type in 1894 (Delivorrias with Berger-Doer and Kossatz Deissmann in LIMC 1981-99, 11, 1 (1984), pp. 23-24, no. 148). The appeal of this figure to Flaxman is obvious, both for its iconography, the mourning woman, and the simplicity of its design which is defined by a few bold lines of the drapery. In the draft of a lecture (V &amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 168) he refers to statues of 'preistesses' to exemplify what is now referred to as the 'severe' style. It is probable that he was thinking of the present type. In the posthumous edition of his Lectures the sculpture is illustrated through an engraving by W. Fairland that is based on the present drawing. There, the figure is labelled Juno Lucina and used to illustrate a type of drapery (Flaxman 1829, p. 245, pl. 47).

Cosma e Damiano on the Forum Romanům. This could be the ancient porphyry urn below the altar of the first chapel on the right, listed by Buchoviecki 1967-97, 1 (1967), p. 599. The inscription for study 2 suggests that this is an object in the church of SS. Martina e Luca, in Flaxman' s time the church of the Accademia di San Luca. The connection of the building to a former Mars temple, though historically incorrect, was a substantial myth since the Middle Ages. The original church (demolished in the seventeenth century) was the Secretarium Senatus , the Archive of the Roman senate (Buchoviecki 1967-97, m (1974), p. 330). The church is presendy inaccessible. The tomb that Flaxman draws in study 3 shows on top of a pedestal a rectangular chest decorated with a relief and crowned by a stepped pyramid. The relief apparendy represents figures in the central nave of a classical basilica before an altar with an eagle hovering above it. While the drawing may record the appearance of a lost monument of unknown dimensions, there is also the possibility that it is a fanciful reconstruction of a damaged monument. Among the monuments along the Via Appia near Albano, the pyramidal tomb on the Via Appia is the most likely candidate (height 16 m; Campbell 2004, 1, p. 210, comp. fig. 62). Albano on the Via Appia was often visited by Grand Tourists (see, for example, Northall 1766, p. 379; Beckford 1786, p. 49; Hobhouse 1796, pp. 160-61).

Two figures, most likely statues, flank the altar, above it appears an altarpiece in the recess. Another large figure, presumably a statue of a bishop, stands on the left-hand side against the wall, and on the wall opposite the beholder there is a tomb chest with a gisante on top.

The mosaic is heavily restored (Berchem and Clouzot 1924, pp. 209-10, pl. 268). The drawing is the first of a number of studies after objects in the Vatican Grottoes in this sketchbook, as well as the first draw- ing after what Flaxman may have considered early Christian images, of which more are represented in V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790. Study 2: Below and to the left of the figure of St. Peter is a very light bust-length sketch of the group Pan and Apollo (or Pan and Daphnis ), first published in 1556 when it belonged to the Cesi collection. In 1622 it was given to the Ludovisi collection where Flaxman must have studied it. It is now in the Museo Nazionale 146</page><page sequence="152">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK Romano, Palazzo Altemps (inv. no. 8571, marble, height 132 cm; Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 286-88, cat. no. 70; Giuliano 1979-95, h 5 (1983), pp. 90-94, cat. no. 38). The group was known in several versions, of which the Ludovisi one was the most publicized (for example, Perrier 1638, pl. 44; mirror reversed). Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 286 note that it was not much reproduced during the eighteenth century and suggest that this may have been because of the homosexual connotations of the work. It is indeed apparent that eighteenth-century literature and reproductions avoid outright references to the sex of the figures represented. Winckelmann (2003, pp. 103, 332) in his notes describes the works as a 'faun who teaches a young human being [einen jungen Menschen ]' and Spence reproduces the head of Pan only (Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 286). Flaxman is no exception as he only represents the busts of the figures, under which circumstances Apollo/ Daphnis could be taken for a woman. Flaxman draws the figures from a position in front and to the right of the group. As a result, both heads appear slighdy out of profile but turned to one another. This creates an expression of mutual engagement that is not supported by the frontal view in which Apollo/Daphnis appears rather disengaged. In fact, Flaxman seems to have exaggerated this aspect of emotional reciprocity by turning the head of Apollo/Daphnis more into profile than it would actually appear from the chosen position. //f. 64V [unused] Location of sources unknown //£. 65t [Bi975.3.468(111)] (Fig. 66) after ancient (stucco) relief A flying figure of Victory, and architectural ornament Graphite (image turned 900 clockwise) A winged figure, possibly representing Victory, flies from right to left, holding what looks like a small baton in her left hand and a large branch in her right. Next to her on the right-hand side Flaxman sketches an upright support partly decorated with a classical architectural ornament. The drawing is uncharacteristically freely executed and omits Flaxman's usual first stage in which the composition is established with faint and rather hesitandy drawn lines. If the unusual choice of technique has anything to do with the appearance of the original, this could reflect a less defined design as it can be found, for example, in ancient stucco decorations. The juxtaposition of flying figures of victory and architectural ornaments are common in that type of decoration.

T4; for an image that precedes Piranesi's print, see Bartoli, Sepolcri , 1697, pl. 47).

The object represented by the larger graphite study on the left is very similar to the masks in f. 59r which explains why Flaxman did not complete it in pen and ink. The two other masks at the upper centre and upper right are of different types. See this sketchbook, f. 59r; V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 27; UCL Journal, f.

In his Lectures Flaxman (1829, p. 96) would later discuss it in terms of 'the heroic', 'passion' and 'maternal affection'. The group is shown fřontally, Niobe's head facing the beholder. The position of the study in the chronological sequence of the sketchbook, where it is surrounded by Roman studies, suggests that he may have studied a Roman plaster cast rather than the Florentine marble. The strong tonal contrasts of the drawing support this thesis as they are typical traits of a drawing after a strongly lit plaster. A group of old casts of the group, made before the originals left for Florence in 1775, still survives today in the Villa Medici. As argued by Geominy 1984, pp. 34-36, these must have been used to replace the originals in the gardens of the villa. The surviving casts are badly damaged and do not include the present sculpture of Niobe and her youngest daughter, but it can safely be assumed that a cast of this central sculpture would have existed. More easily accessible would have been another, securely documented cast in the French Academy in Palazzo Mancini (see Macsotay forthcoming 2010).

The four designs that Flaxman made on this and the following folio represent the ancient object in a highly systematic fashion and demonstrate Flaxman's antiquarian interests and abilities. He may have made these precise designs with a publication or sale of drawings in mind. A similar set of draw- ings after the same object, though much less accomplished, was published in Tatham 1799. Flaxman appears on p. 10 among the subscribers. A gilded Council chair (c. 1813) in the possession of the Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, at Carlton House, London may be based on Tatham' s design (Age of Neo- Classicism 1972, p. 768, cat. no. 1640). It illustrates potential uses of Flaxman's studies after ancient works. Given his earlier work for Josiah Wedgwood, Flaxman would have been aware of such practical applications.

Flaxman recalls in this drawing the lunette composition of the tomb for Ann Russell (died 1780) and her son Henry (died 1781) in the church of All Saints in Lydd, Kent, one of the few tomb monuments Flaxman executed before his journey (Irwin 1976, p. 12, fig. 12). Reproducing a design of his own, Flaxman executes the drawing swifdy and without any pentimenti. While in the original design the figures overlap the frame and inscription with remains of baroque theatricality, in the drawing the design is clarified and more static, as all figures are fitted into the lunette. The drawing is executed in very fine lines and hardly legible.

In this unfinished half-length study Flaxman depicts the group from the right-hand side facing Niobe's body fřontally, her head in profile to the left. Technically, the drawing differs from any of the earlier ones in that it is made with thick and boldly applied strokes of graphite. In a second stage Flaxman fixed the lines with graphite, exerting stronger pressure. This stage is largely limited to the rendering of the mother's chiton. 149</page><page sequence="155">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK See this sketchbook, ff.ior (for a discussion of the Niobe Group), nr, I2r, 6gr (for the likely model of this drawing), 73r; Fitzwilliam Journal, ff. 6r and 6v; Flaxman 1829, pp. 96, 284-85. //f. 72V [unused] //f. 73r [Bi975.3.468(ttt)] (Fig- 75) after ancient sculpture Niobe and her youngest daughter Graphite This is another drawing after the sculpture of Niobe and her youngest daughter. This drawing shows the group obliquely from behind. Niobe's head appears nearly in profile to the right. Flaxman has established the outlines of the intertwined figures with bold lines of graphite. Some of the facial features, the back and parts of the hip and right leg of her daughter have been accentuated through darker tones, produced through increased pressure on the medium. While the sketch appears unfinished, Flaxman may never have intended to develop it further. In conjunction with the earlier two drawings after the sculpture it would have provided important additional information about the spatial relationship of the two figures. A similarly economical approach to multiple drawings of identical motifs can also be found among Flaxman's drawings after life (for example, V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, P- 35)- See this sketchbook, ff. ior (for a discussion of the Niobe Group), nr, I2r, Ó9r (for a discussion of the likely model of this drawing), 72r; Fitzwilliam Journal, ff. 6r and 6v; Flaxman 1829, pp. 96, 284-85. //£. 73V [unused] Rome, Church of S.

Maria sopra Minerva (marble, 85 x 210 cm; Robert in ASR, m, 1 (1897), pp. 120-22, cat. no. 98). Arberini died in 1476, but Robert established that the relief did not form part of the original tomb design. In 1556 it was still mentioned in the house of M. Metello Varro Porcarij in the vicinity of the church, where it was also recorded by the artists of the Codex Coburgensis (before 1555, Matz 1871, p. 490, cat. no. 19). In the second half of the sixteenth century it must have been inserted into the tomb. Flaxman's drawing is a rough sketch. The figure of Hercules is given a slightly higher degree of finish, while the lion is deprived of its mane and only indicated in the most rudimentary and insecure manner. Flaxman would later make a more developed drawing after the relief in the V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 52r.

In front of the column stands a building that has at its centre a large colonnade, the side recesses are perforated by arcades. This could be read as a free reconstruction of the Basilica Ulpia at Trajan's Forum. The area surrounding Trajan's column was still densely built up towards the end of the eighteenth century; systematic excavations did not start before 1812 (Bertoldi 1962, p. 7). Flaxman may have made this sketch in the context of a conversation with architect friends, such as the Frenchman Charles Percier, and it may have been based on ancient literary accounts as well as the scarce visual evidence.

For the English visitor the tomb of the only British Pope, Hadrian IV (1154-59) must have been of some importance (Toth 1955, pp. 110-11, no. 41). Flaxman's study of his sarcophagus in the Vatican Grottoes might reflect personal patriotic sentiments and/or the anticipation of potential commissions for drawings of this monument. Indeed, Flaxman produces a systematic and complete set of studies after the monument on this and the following folio. The present frontal view is a carefully worked up drawing that records the decoration of the sarcophagus. Tatham 1799 contains a not dissimilar plate with front and side elevations of the tomb; Flaxman is listed on p. 10 among the subscribers of the volume.

It was a major attraction for the Grand Tourist outside Rome and is mentioned, for example, by Wright who also includes a print of it (Wright 1730, p. 367; see also Lalande 1769, v, pp. 364-68). The temple's Corinthian capitals were of particular fame. The architect Sir John Soane had studied the temple and its capitals as a student during his Grand Tour in 1778-79. Soane had slight contacts with Flaxman before Flaxman's tour to Italy (Dorey 2003, p. 25). Later he would copy the columns of the temple in his design of the Bank of England (1818-23) (Dorey and Abramson in Richardson and Stevens 1999, p. 102, cat. nos. 19 and 20, pp. 245-48, cat. nos. 159-62). See UCL Journal, Cat. no. 17 for another study of a Corinthian capital. //f. 78V (Fig- 82) after life A horse in profile to right Graphite and chalk (image turned 1800) A stallion stands in profile to the right on all four hoofs, the long tail is hanging straight down, the ears are pricked. The stance of the animal is untypical of representations of horses in ancient Roman art (cf., for example, f. 67r above) and it seems most likely that this is a drawing after life. Flaxman's drawings of horses in his own compositions are very close to this (for example, Ulysses Following the Car of Nausicaa , Flaxman, Odyssey 1870, pl. 11). Rome, Vatican (Vatican Grottoes) //f. 79r [B 1 975 . 3 . 468 (aaaa)] (Fig. 83) after ancient architectural decoration Pilaster with rinceaux and figurative ornament Graphite and pen and ink A detail of one of the four Roman pilasters from the third century ad that are inserted into the walls of the Vatican Grottoes (90 x 54 cm; Gusman 1912, 2, p. 15, pl. 94; Krautheimer 1970, 1, p. 280, n. 11). Within the rinceaux decoration appear figures from classical mythology. In the upper part Apollo is shown as he is flaying Marsyas who is accompanied by a satyr. Two reclining figures above contemplate the scene. Personifications of tragedy and comedy appear in bust length below. Flaxman retraces the quick sketch with pen and ink but does not go beyond an outlining of the figures and rough noting of the ornament.

The table lists the scenes of Ghiberďs North Doors for the Florentine Baptistery. The numbering, partly illegible, is of the narratives, starting from the third row up, left to right and bottom to top. The left-hand column lists the panels of the right-hand door, the right-hand column those of the left-hand door. While the narrative on the doors develops consistently from left to right, Flaxman occasionally listed the scenes preceding from right to left within the individual door. This suggests that he made the list on the spot and added the numbers later to indicate the correct sequence. Flaxman's identification of this scene is mistaken, it is the Appearance of Christ to the Disciples. 4 The bottom row of reliefs shows the four Latin Fathers of the church (doctors of the church); the second row, contrary to Flaxman's identification, the four Evangelists, only two of whom are apostles. 156</page><page sequence="162">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK 5 Without any specific context, it is difficult to identify the painting Flaxman is referring to. Ghirlandaio painted a small number of Adorations of the Magi , and Flaxman may have attributed works to him that are now no longer associated with the artist. Among the works attributed to Ghirlandaio today, the Adoration of the Magi in the Ospedale degli Innocenti fits the description best because of its musician angels (Cadogan 2000, pp. 259-61, figs. 173, 193). A refer- ence to 'wise men offering by Ghirlandaio 1450' can also be found in the inside of the cover of the Fitzwilliam Journal; it is impossible to state whether he refers in both cases to the same painting. 6 On the provenance of the volume, see editor's note. 7 The Flaxmans lived from 1788 to 1790 near the Piazza di Spagna and the Church of S. Trinità del Monte in the Stalla Mignanelli. Their flat had been inhabited before by Banks and Tresham. This was the house of the engraver Domenico Cunego who worked in Berlin from 1785-89 (Ingamells 1996, p. 362; Irwin 1979, p. 48; Symmons 1984, p. 68). Whether the present statement relates to this address is unclear, the identity of Mr Nulti is unknown. 8 The calculations below resemble very closely those in f. 78r. Like these, they may relate to the commission by Lord Bristol of The Fury of Athamas. 9 John Devaere and his wife travelled with the Flaxmans down to Italy, but rather than crossing the Alps, like the Flaxmans, they went via Marseilles and arrived in Rome by 6 October 1787 (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, ff. ir, 17V; Ingamells 1996, 294). In Rome the Devaeres lived initially with the Flaxmans and then near them. Devaere was commissioned by Josiah Wedgwood to work as a modeller with Flaxman (Ingamells 1996, pp. 294-95). The present note in Flaxman's sketchbook suggests that Flaxman provided him with sources for his work. Ingamells (1996, p. 294) states that in December 1788 Devaere was making a bas relief of the Rape of Proserpina after a relief in the Barberini Palace for Wedgwood, working from a cast that he wanted to send together with other casts to Wedgwood. This suggests that Flaxman provided Devaere with the listed reproductions after ancient works in 1788. That these were drawings and not casts can be safely assumed as the last work in the list is a reproduction of the monumen- tal relief from the pedestal of the column of Antoninus Pius (see n. 13). 10 There are many Bacchic sarcophagus reliefs in the Vatican collections that Flaxman could have copied (Matz in ASR, iv, 4 (ï975)» P- 527)- A drawing by Flaxman in the Metropolitan Museum at New York (Acc. no. 61. 129. 2) depicts a Bacchic sarcophagus, but the relief on which this drawing is based has not been identified. 11 The arrangement of the list suggests that this is a work in the Vatican. Flaxman copied a gem of the same subject in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 69. 12 There are two sarcophagus reliefs representing the Rape of Proserpina in the Villa Borghese; Robert in ASR, in, 3 (19 19), pp. 465-66, no. 373, pp. 491-92, no. 413. It is likely that Flaxman copied no. 413, if he had any. say in the choice, as this relief grants a full view of Pluto's muscular back, a motif that Flaxman studied in f. 39r of the present sketchbook and f. I9r of the V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790. In contrast, no. 373 shows Pluto frontally but largely concealed by the body of Proserpina whom he holds across his body. Ingamells (1996, p. 294) reports that in December 1788 Devaere was making for Wedgwood a bas relief of the Rape of Proserpina after a relief in the Barberini Palace (see n. 9). 13 This is possibly a detail from a sarcophagus relief inserted into the garden façade of the Villa that represents on the left-hand side a religious ceremony, involving among other figures two boys standing either side of a tree. Flaxman may have read the scene as harvest-related (Cagiano de Azevedo 195 1, p. 76, no. 65, pl. 30, no. 48). 14 Here Flaxman refers to two scenes from the relief of the Borghese Vase (Louvre inv. no. MA86, height 17 1.5 cm, Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 314-15, no. 81; Grassinger 1991, pp. 181-83, no- 23, figs. 83-90). Devaere would model for Flaxman a terracotta relief after the frieze of the vase, see n. 31. 15 The work has not been identified. 16 This is possibly the sarcophagus fragment depicting Bacchus with a satyr standing in a chariot that is drawn by two centaurs (Matz and Duhn 1881-82, 11 (1881), p. 70, no. 2306; Salerno 1964, p. 238, no. 56, fig. 140). 17 The sarcophagus relief of Orestes and Iphigenia , formerly in the Palazzo Accoramboni is now in Munich (Robert in ASR, li (1890), pp. 177-79, no* 167). It was first documented towards the end of the sixteenth century and is discussed by Winckelmann (1767 (1821), 11, no. 149, pp. 200-02). See further p. 546 below. 18 This might be a drawing after a vase that was found in 1754 in Herculaenum, Villa dei Papiri and is now in Naples, Museo Nazionale (inv. no. 6779; Grassinger 1991, pp. 178- 80, no. 21, figs. 74-82). Flaxman may have seen it during his visit to Naples. 19 This must be a drawing based on the sketch in the present sketchbook f. 45r of the relief of this subject from the pedestal of the column of Antoninus Pius. 20 As recognized by Irwin (1979, p. 45 with n. 30), this list of drawings of bas reliefs for Mr Knight is an overspill from the last entry on f. 8or, dated 19 May 1791, and expands on the entry 'Ten drawings of bas-reliefs'; see n. 32. The relief remains unidentified. 22 This is possibly a drawing based on the sketch in V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 56r, after the relief in the façade of the Villa Borghese. 23 It is likely that these are drawings based on Flaxman's sketches in V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, ff. jrt 8 v and 9r, and iov and nr after the reliefs from the so-called Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus in the Palazzo S. Croce, now at Munich. 24 As argued by Irwin (1979, p. 45), this is a drawing of the pastiche of ancient fragments in the Palazzo Giustiniani that Flaxman identified as the Death of Orpheus, V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 2r. A drawing in the Whitworth Art Gallery at Manchester may represent an intermediate stage between the sketch in Flaxman's sketchbook and the dispatched work as it is more worked up but not fully completed. This could be the right-hand side of a sarcophagus relief in the walls of the Villa Medici at Rome. Flaxman copied the left-hand side and the centre of the relief (but not the scene of Bacchus finding Ariadne) in the V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, ff. 4r and 5r. The fragment of two female figures could refer to a draw- ing based on either a sketch in this sketchbook, f. 48r/i above (from the Villa Borghese), or V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 42r /3 (from the Palazzo Giustiniani). 157</page><page sequence="163">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK 27 Thamyris was a Thracian singer who defied the Muses and therefore was blinded by them (Nercessian in LIMC 1981-99, vu, i (1994), pp. 902-04). Flaxman's source has not been identified. 28 This is possibly based on the drawing in BL Journal, Cat. no. 4 f. 37V, of the relief from the portico of the Temple of Love in the gardens of the Duke of Bouillon's casde Navarre near Evreux. There is also a sketch of a similar subject after an unidentified source in f. 5or in the present sketchbook. This is less likely to be the model for the drawing for Mr Knight as the sketch is very loose and the picture field irregular. 29 In Italy Flaxman worked still for Wedgwood, receiving money from him through the English banker Thomas Jenkins who acted as go-between (Constable 1927, p. 27). This entry consists of an invoice to Josiah Wedgwood and notes the receipt of payment ten days later. The commissioned work was a three-dimensional portrait of Victor Amadeus III, King of Sardinia and Duke of Savoy, based on a miniature in a snuff box (Irwin 1979, p. 28). 30 The entry on the lower left of this folio relates to a work by John Devaere on a marble sculpture, most likely the Bust of Homer that Flaxman sold in 1791 to Mr Knight. The entry includes the price for the marble, the sawing of the marble by one Bernardino and the transport of the marble to a work- shop in Strada Felice where John Devaere would carve it. Because of a flaw in the marble Flaxman had to provide him with a new piece of marble. He would later charge Mr Knight a small amount for the work on the abandoned version (see n. 32). The present entry, dated September 1788, records the sending to Mr Edward Knight of a terracotta relief after the Borghese Vase , modelled by John Devaere for John Flaxman. Mr Knight from Portland Square, London, was one of Flaxman's earliest English clients (Irwin 1979, p. 45). Flaxman refers to this commission in a letter to John Romney dated 25 May 1788, Rome, reproduced in Constable 1927, p. 31. He mentions that the figures were of a height of 1 foot. Flaxman sketches the entire relief with measurements in this journal on f. 79V. Drawings after scenes from the Borghese Vase were given by Flaxman to Devaere earlier in 1788; see n. 14. Flaxman reported in November 1788, two months af- ter dispatching the relief, that Devaere had worked successfully on the relief of the Borghese Vase (Ingamells 1996, p. 295). On the Borghese Vase , see above n. 14. 32 This is Flaxman's entry for the dispatch on 19 May 1791 to Mr Knight of the marble Bust of Homer carved by John Devaere after Flaxman's design (see n. 30) and of the ten drawings listed separately on f. 8ov (see nn. 20-28). Knight's commission is now fully completed and Flaxman makes the final sums. The difference between the ¿102 7 s. and the £100 originally paid by Knight in June 1789 (see f. 79V with n. 33) derives from the expense on the initial bust of Homer that had to be abandoned because of a flaw in the marble (see n. 30). 33 After receipt of the first part of his commission, dispatched by Flaxman in September 1788, Mr Knight paid on 27 June 1789 what must have been the agreed amount of £100 for the commission. 34 This is the first of two major payments by Flaxman to Devaere for the Bust of Homer commissioned from Flaxman by Mr Edward Knight, London. Flaxman had paid smaller amounts for the work in Mav and Tune 1789. 35 The date for this second major payment by Flaxman to John Devaere for the Bust of Homer is not complete. Given that Flaxman dated the dispatch of the bust 17 May 1791, it seems likely that the date of this payment is 18 May 1791. 36 These calculations seem to relate to Lord Bristol's commission of the Fury of Athamas. Flaxman worked on the marble group of the dimensions of the Laocoon from 1790 to 1794. He received 600 guineas for it to cover all costs, including those of the marble, and was left seriously out of pocket (Irwin 1979, pp. 55-68). The first line seems to give the price of the block of marble (cf. Symmonds 1984, P- 74). 158</page><page sequence="164">FLAXMAN: YALE SKETCHBOOK Fig. i Folios 30V and 3 ir. Fig. 2 Folio ir.

JOURNAL AND SKETCHBOOK USED BY JOHN FLAXMAN DURING A VISIT TO NAPLES AND ITS ENVIRONS, DATED 20 JANUARY 1788 (University College London) Transcribed , edited and catalogued by A. E. Wright Editor's Note The journal consists of 47 pages in addition to the cover, the pages measuring approximately 21.5 x 15.4 cm, and has been completed in pen, graphite and grey wash. Flaxman drew and wrote mostly on the rectos, and numbered in pencil the manuscript folios, omitting those used primarily for drawings. The journal contains notes and sketches from Flaxman's visits to the palaces at Portici and Capodimonte and to the ruins at Pompeii, Pozzuoli and, it seems, Paestum, with several drapery and figure studies, a gem possibly copied from the Worsley collection in Rome (Cat. no. 37), and one of Flaxman's own compositional sketches (Cat. no. 23). A list of accounts inside the cover includes several items relating specifically to his stay in Naples. A manuscript note is pasted into the volume: 'This book is intended to be given and I do now give it to the University College to belong to and to form part of the Flaxman Gallery / Henry Vaughan / 4 April 1855 The original book has been disbanded and the pages inlaid into a larger bound volume, the journal cover pasted down so that its outside cannot be seen. Most of the pages have also been pasted down so that only one side is visible, and the foliation here follows the order of the binding. It should be noted that f. 16 is pasted so that the visible side with its drawing of a gladiatorial helmet faces f. I7r, and is therefore given here as f. i6v. Editorial Conventions Flaxman's spelling, capitalization and punctuation have been transcribed as seen, with editorial insertions marked by square brackets, e.g. [,]. [sic] indicates an originally misspelled word, repeated word, etc. Superscript has been used where Flaxman adds a raised word or passage. Triangular brackets indicate either an illegible passage, or a word that can only be guessed, e.g. &lt;. . .&gt;. Single or double strikethroughs have been used as they appear in the journal; however, when Flaxman uses more than two strikethroughs a single one is used, followed by the actual number in square brackets. Some of Flaxman's introductory phrases are written in slightly larger script and appear to be intended as headings; these are indicated with bold script. A page break is marked as //[f. ir], with Flaxman's own numbering indicated in bold, e.g. 1. A separate numbering system is also used in the journal, as may be seen from some of the figures; this has not been transcribed, firstly as it is supposed it may postdate Flaxman, and secondly as it is a little inconsistent. There are also a few barely legible pencilled instructions to the binder of the volume regarding inlaying etc., which have not been transcribed. Four small sketches which appear within the main text have been reproduced within this transcript, but all the larger drawings are illustrated as figures at the end of this section. They are indicated in the transcript with a descriptive title in bold capitals, a catalogue number and a figure number, e.g. //[f. 34r] TWO DORIC CAPITALS (Cat. no. 25, Fig. 25), and are discussed in a catalogue which follows the transcript, rather than in endnotes. The Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli is abbreviated to MNN throughout, except in bibliogra- phical references. Its inventory numbers are preceded by 'MNN inv. no.'. 187</page><page sequence="192">flaxman: ucl journal //[Inside cover] &lt; &gt; -5 &lt;..&gt; -3- &lt;Glass&gt; - 9 - Paid Scud&lt;i&gt; &lt;. . .&gt; Hostels - &lt;8&gt; Play1 &amp; book - i - 2 permission to see Portici2 - - 2 bread, butter &amp; sug - 3 - 5 Flannel - 9 at Portici to the Custodi - i - to the Porter - - 2 - &lt;Porcelana3&gt; - - 6 butter sugar - -3-4 Play - - 6 - Maps &lt;Ducats&gt; &lt;i5&gt; - 2 - Maps - - 9 - &lt;books&gt; - 10 - Capo di Monte - 1 - 2 - &lt;Hostels/Hostess&gt; - 12 - 2 - going to Pompeia [sic] - - 7 - Guide - 7 - Shoes for N4- - 9 - Nancy - 3 - D° - i - 5 - Ribbon &amp; play5 - - 9 - &lt;M. . .&gt; - --6- Nancy - 2 - - &lt;Sundries&gt; - -1-5 letters - -3 - 3 39 -&lt;...&gt; //[€. ir] 'TITLE-PAGE' WITH FAINT SKETCHES OF A FIGURE IN PROFILE AND DORIC ARCHITECTURE (Cat. no. 1, Fig. 1) &lt;i/&gt; Naples Jany 20th: 1788 //[f.

This is possibly one of the ancient Doric temples at Paestum (see Cat. no. 25); see Piranesi 1778, pls. 1 and 3. The figure in profile precedes twelve pages with drapery studies of full-length figures, mostly male, for which see Cat. no. 2. 2. (f. 2r) Drapery study (Fig. 2) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; 211 x 138 A young man walking in profile to left, his cloak thrown over his left shoulder. One of a series of drapery stu- dies of full-length male figures; see also Cat. nos. 3-10, 16. Together with three studies of female figures and heads (Cat. nos. 11-13), these are drawn in outline with very little circumstantial information, the majority having a plain, dark wash background. Flaxman used this type of figure repeatedly in his later works and made many drapery studies throughout his life, though the careful addition of the wash background to purely linear (and seemingly quick) sketches is unusual, and probably indicates the influence of fifth-century red-figure Greek vases. His 1789 drawing of Alcestis and Admetus (an early, unpublished illustration to Euripides) is clearly imitative of such vases, portraying classical figures with a very similar method to that used here (Tate collection, inv. no. T08234; see Lyles and Hamlyn 1997, pp. 160-61, cat. no. 62; Irwin 1979, pp. 67-68). The drawings have the appearance of studio poses (compare V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 15) and employ classical motifs such as the arm wound up in the wearer's cloak (see, for example, Cat. no. 33 in the present journal, and V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. i4r). However, they may also have been drawn from direct observation, or inspired by Italians seen during Flaxman's travels (see Bindman 1979, pp. 70-77). The figures recall Flaxman's description of the people of Lombardy at BL Journal, ťf. 20v and 2ir: they are large handsome &amp; well made[.] the men have large strong distinct features with great black peirc- ing [sic] eyes[,] their faces strongly resembling many fine Characters of the roman busts, their hair is luxuriant &amp; as many wear neither shoes or stockings they show wonderful fine legs &amp; feet which with the general grandeur of their shape //Sc the great Cloaks in which they are dressed make them prodigious grand figures. Note also Lady Anna Miller's description of the men of Fondi, which lies on the road from Rome to Naples: 'The men wear a great loose cloak, in which they wrap themselves up to the chin; round their legs and feet are wound stripes of very coarse linen, but no shoes' (Miller 1776, 11, pp. 217-18). 3.

Several of the figures have cloaks covering their mouths, a device probably inspired by red-figure Greek vases and which Flaxman often used in later work, such as in his portrayal of Virgil throughout the illustrations to Dante. 195</page><page sequence="200">flaxman: ucl journal 4.

One of numerous simple figure drawings of women made by Flaxman throughout his career, this may be a drapery study like the preceding sketches (the emphasis being on the full skirts of the sitter), or simply the capturing of picturesque local detail. A privately owned Flaxman sketchbook, also made in Italy, contains many drawings of Italian women both in scenes of everyday life and as costume studies, including several detailed profile heads; see Irwin 1979, pp. 47-50. 12.

(f. i6v) Gladiatorial helmet decorated with bas-reliefs of the destruction of Troy (Fig- 14) Pen and brown ink over graphite; 216 x 148 Gladiatorial helmet in the collection of the MNN, height 45 cm (MNN inv. no. 5673), part of a large collection of armour found in the colonnade to the Large Theatre at Pompeii; an account both of the discovery and of this particular helmet is given in Gell 1817-19, p. 245. Flaxman describes the Portici collection of armour on ff. I7r and i8r (see notes 27-29), although he does not specifically mention this piece; it is, however, the only clearly identifiable object from Portici that he draws in the present journal. Flaxman has drawn the helmet in profile to show the bas-reliefs on the calotte of the rape of Cassandra by Ajax, and Neoptolemus (Pyrrhus) killing Priam, with priests offering cists to Julus (Ascanius) on the crest. He has omitted the figure of Venus who appears to Aeneas at the far right side of the calotte (the latter figure would be invisible from this angle), and further reliefs on the cheekplates and flap. On the other, unseen, side, the crest is decorated with vestals, and the calotte shows Aeneas escaping with Anchises, and Julus between Aeneas and Creusa (Pesce 1932, p. 24). Flaxman's Italian sketchbooks contain several secondary representations of helmets and armour taken from bas-reliefs and statuettes of warriors, in likely preparation for the illustrations to Homer (commissioned after his 1788 visit to Naples), which would require numerous battle scenes (see V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 109; Yale Sketchbook, f. 3or, and back cover). Flaxman was evidently fascinated by the conjunction in this helmet of a rare, surviving piece of armour with an example of ancient Homeric bas-relief narrative, though he was clearly at this time more interested in the latter, as an authentic model for his own 'compositions'; these, from contemporary letters, were occupying much of his time; see Irwin 1979, pp. 67-68; letter to his parents, 2 April 1788 (Flaxman Letterbook, f. 4iv); letter to Romney, 25 May 1788 (quoted in Constable 1927, p. 31). He particularly wishes to record the detail of Neoptolemus killing Priam (see also Cat. no. 15), though it is inac- curate in several points; visitors to Portici were notoriously banned from taking notes or making sketches in the museum, which perhaps accounts for the incompleteness of the drawing (Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 75). Lady Anna Miller also particularly noted the 'historical representations' in bas-relief on the armour, describing scenes very similar to these, but ascribing them to a shield (Miller 177 6, 11, p. 265). For images of the helmet, see Maiuri 1971, pp. 137-38, showing this side but from a different angle; Ruesch 191 1, 1, pp. 414-15 (which particularly praises the groups of Neoptolemus and Priam, and Cassandra and Ajax); and Pesce 1932, p. 68; for the other side, see Ceci, pl. 6, fig. 39 and Donaldson 1827, 1, pl. 76. 15. (f. 24V) Bas-relief decorations on a gladiatorial helmet; sketch of a cuirass (Fig. 15) Graphite with some pen and grey ink; graphite (image turned 1800); 214 x 157 An enlarged and partially amended detail of Cat. no. 14, showing primarily the scene of Neoptolemus killing Priam. The two figures are more detailed and interact more properly than before, though Priam's arms have been altered and are less accurate. The figure of Venus has been added, Aeneas' sword seen held out in front of her, but Flaxman's lesser interest in the corresponding scene of the rape of Cassandra is evident. The pencil sketch of an andromorphic cuirass with straps may be intended to elaborate Neoptolemus' costume (see the comments on body armour on f. i8r), though see also an Oscan-Samnite chest-piece illustrated in Ruesch 191 1, I, p. 416, fig. 95. 197</page><page sequence="202">flaxman: ucl journal 1 6.

The capital bears some resemblance to those of the portico and the cella of the temple, and the divergence between the actual appearance of the capitals and the drawing may result from their partly ruined state. Pompeii abounds in fantastic Corinthian capitals made of stucco, character- ized by Mau as part of a reactionary movement against traditional Greek marble architecture (Mau 1907, pp. 442-44). It is tempting to imagine, from his juxtaposition here of the barest outline of an ancient temple with a piece of superficial decoration, that Flaxman would have agreed with Mau's critical tone: 'in the orna- mentation of this temple . . . simple and chaste forms . . . were replaced by gaudy stucco ornaments more in harmony with the prevailing taste (ibid., pp. 171-72) - especially in view of Flaxman's stated preference for the Doric architecture at Paestum (see Cat. no. 25). Note, however, his sympathetic sketches of the Temple of Isis at Cat. nos. 29-30, and see also further capitals at Cat. nos. 25, 27-28, and one of the Corinthian capitals from the Temple of the Sibyl at Tivoli, at Yale Sketchbook, f. 78r. 18. (f. 28r) Tomb of Marcus Cerrinius Restitutus on the Street of Tombs, Pompeii (Fig. 18) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; 149 x 190 Inscribed: An open Chappie [sic] in the street before you arrive at the gate of Pompeia [sic] One of several monuments drawn by Flaxman on the prestigious Street of Tombs leading to the Herculaneum Gate at Pompeii; see also Cat. nos. 19-22, 24. The niche-form tomb (ad 52-62, excavated 1763) has low stone seats and a niche for a stele and herm on the back wall. On its discovery it also contained a cubical stone which served as an altar (now destroyed), as well as a sacrificial tripod and a herm-form statue of the deceased in the character of Mercury, with wings and petasos, accompanied by a tortoise and ram. Flaxman must have known that such a statue once existed in the niche, and reconstructs his own sketchy version here as a full-length figure rather than a portrait herm, in line with his conception of the tomb as a 'chappie'. Near-contemporaries also thought the tomb a place of public worship, sacred to the deities of the ways ( dii viales) or possibly to Apollo (Gell 1817-19, pp. 93-95; Mazois 1824, 1, pp. 27-28, pl. 7; Donaldson 1827, 11, p. 22). The statue is now believed to be 'a rare instance of private apotheosis at Pompeii', or possibly an 'embellishment of daily roles', the dead man perhaps having been a trader (S. Cormack, in Dobbins and Foss 2007, p. 597). Flaxman omits the paintings on the inner walls that were then visible, along with any indication of the brickwork. He indicates at right the faint outline of the left end of the bench tomb of Aulus Veius (see Cat. no. 20) which adjoins this tomb, though the two are actually much further apart; the Herculaneum Gate would be immediately to the left. See Mazois 1824, 1, pl. 11; Mau 1907, pp. 408-09; Kockel 1983, pp. 47-51. 19.

Flaxman has slightly lengthened the remaining structure of the Garland Tomb, which actually consists of a square with four pillars of equal width each with the remainder of a Corinthian capital, rather than the two given here. He has added a triangular roof and rearranged or added decorative elements to the façade, seemingly transposing (though inaccurately) the garland motif from the sides of the tomb. In parts, the result strongly resembles the reconstruction by Mazois of the tomb of Arrius 198</page><page sequence="203">flaxman: ucl journal Diomedes (Mazois 1824, 1, pl. 4; Kockel 1983, pp. 180-82), but this tomb is too high above the paving stones of the street, and lacks the base and adjoining wall. The gleaming whiteness and flatness of the tomb compared to its surroundings could perhaps be an attempt to acknowledge the reconstruction (see Cat. nos. 22, 29), or could indicate the stucco which originally covered many tombs, including that of Diomedes. 20. (f. 30r) Semicircular bench tombs ( scholae ), Pompeii (Fig- 20) Pen and grey ink over graphite; graphite; 150 x 216 Inscribed on bench: CALPHVRNIVS SACERDOS ; below image; Two stone Public seats A s'ree' as you approach the gate of Pompeia [sic] View of the right-hand side of the Street of Tombs as one approaches the Herculaneum Gate, with the schola tomb to the duumvir Aulus Veius at left, the base of the supposed tomb of Marcus Porcius at centre, and the schola to the priestess Mamia at right; Flaxman omits the tomb of the Istacidii, which is located behind the schola of Mamia, and which he draws at Cat. nos. 22, 24. The winged lion's paw bench-end sketched at bottom left is probably from the tomb of Veius, as Flaxman also draws it at Cat. nos. 18,21 and 27. Mau considers these bench-ends as coarse and vigorous, in the character of the art brought to Pompeii by the Roman colonists, whereas those on Mamia' s schola are 'more delicate' and suggestive of a later date, late Augustan or Tiberian (Mau 1907, pp. 409-10, 156). The scholae are unique to Pompeii, and seem to have been highly prestigious. Their exact use as burial places is not clear, though they appear similar to honorific benches in the Hellenistic East, and Mau believes they characterise 'that friendly relation with the living, the desire for which so often finds expression in Roman epitaphs' (Mau 1907, pp. 409-10; S. Cormack, in Dobbins and Foss 2007, pp. 586-90). Their public function as resting-places for passers by was much remarked by visitors, and it is difficult to be sure how much Flaxman thought of them in funerary terms. Starke (1800, 11, p. 105) describes 'a semi-circular seat in which the Romans used to assemble and converse', Forsyth (18 16, p. 306) more expansively remarking, 'the inscription on one of these denotes a place of sepulture; but for whatever they were raised, they stood here for public resort, and may be considered as hemicyclions , where the ancients held their conversazioni . A note in Nancy Flaxman's diary from the Pompeian visit mentions that Flaxman drew one of 'two large semicircular seats for the Inhabitants to sit [?] &amp; Gossop [sic] . . . they have a Noble appearance - ' (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 68v). Contrary to this drawing, the inscription on the schola to Mamia reaches all the way round the bench and actually reads 'MAMIA P. F. SACERDOTI PVBLICAE . LOCVS SEPVLTVR DATVS DECVRIONVM DECRETO' (Mau 1907, p. 410). Flaxman may have been remembering the inscription 'L. Calfurnius L.F. templům Augusto cum ornamentis DD' at the cathedral church of Pozzuoli, once a temple to Augustus (Lalande 1769, vu, p. 35; for Pozzuoli, see Cat. no. 31), or the supposed owner of the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum, L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (J. I. Porter, in Coates and Seydl 2007, p. 98). Flaxman's drawing is a rather schematic record of this famous view. The scholae were some of the earliest known monuments of Pompeii after their excavation in the 1760s, and were recorded in a variety of ways by artists. See the long view in Mazois of this side of the street, which also includes the tombs of Cerrinius Restitutus (Cat. no. 18) and the Istacidii (Cat. nos. 22, 24) (Mazois 1824, 1, pl. 7); also the reconstruction of the area outside the Herculaneum Gate in Gell (Gell 1817-19, pl. 19 opposite p. 137); the dramatic renderings by Piranesi, where the benches suddenly tower above the tourists (Piranesi 1804-07 (1837), 1, pls. 4, 5); and Tischbein's 1789 portrait of Goethe's patron Anna Amalia, Duchess of Saxony- Weimar, seated on the schola to Mamia (Kockel 1983, pl. 13b). 21.

This rendition of the tomb of Aulus Veius is pure neo-classical elegance, recording the simple curve of the bench and hinting at, but not delineating, the knotted muscles of the lion's paw bench-ends. The differentiated blocks of tufa that make up the bench are omitted: the bench gleams in comparison with slabs of the same tufa paving the road, and the bricks of the wall behind. 199</page><page sequence="204">flaxman: ucl journal The wall, pedestal and its statue of the deceased are now missing from the schola ; see the photograph with the wall and the pedestal in Mau 1907, p. 409, fig. 236. 22.

Cross-section of the lower chamber of the tomb of the Istacidii, showing the niches for funerary urns and the central pillar (Mau 1907, p. 412). The sketchier and unelaborated roof marks the parts reconstructed by Flaxman, perhaps deliberately as seems to have been the case in Cat. no. 29. Flaxman's inscrip- tion probably follows Thomas Martyn's description of the tomb as 'that of the Terentian family', or both may derive from another source such as a local guide (Martyn 1787, pp. 290-91). The misattribution may derive from the nearby tomb of Titus Terentius Felix (see the plan of the Street of Tombs in Kockel 1983, following p. 212). Nancy Flaxman refers to 'a large tomb of the Aruntian family' in her diary, and directs the reader to 'F's book' for these sketches (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 68v). 23. (f. 32v) Compositional sketch of a row of figures (Fig. 23) Graphite; 155 x 212 A frieze of faint figures with the suggestion of a skirmish at left, and a clearer group of mourning women leaning together at right, four figures from this latter section repeated above. The style is typical of Flaxman's working out of his own compositions, on which he seems to have been working a great deal in 1788, even before the commission for the illustrations to Homer (see Cat. no. 14). Both aspects of this composition do, however, bear some resemblance to a separate sheet of sketches towards the Iliad held by the British Museum (inv. no. 1888,0503.15), in which one can see the developing scenes of Andromache fainting ('Around a train of weeping sisters stands, / To raise her sinking with assistant hands', Flaxman, Iliad 1870, pl. 30), and also the Fight for the Body of Patroclus (pl. 22). In particular, the woman bent over as if in supplication in the present sketch is very like one of the women supporting Andromache in the British Museum sheet. The basic structure of a group of sorrowful women holding each other up, one looking backwards, is certainly suggestive of the final group of Andromache fainting, though the figures here are much stiffer and quite different in detail to the final composition. Indeed, the woman who looks back sorrowfully over her shoulder is very close to one of the daughters of Pandarus from Flaxman's Odyssey, pl. 29, and the right-hand side of the present drawing may be an early source for either or both scenes. There is no obvious source for the composition either in the catalogues of Neapolitan or Pompeian antiquities, or in Reinach (1909-12). 24. (f. 33r) Plan and elevation of the tomb of the Istacidii, Pompeii (Fig. 24) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; 151 x 214 Inscribed: Pompeia , [sic] the Teruntian Tomb N° : 1 See also Cat. no. 22. The tomb lies behind the schola of Mamia (Cat. no. 20); it was built along the lines of a temple, and is now thought to have been surmounted by a second roofed circular structure supported by col- umns (Kockel 1983, pp. 60-67, pls. 11-13). Flaxman would have seen only the lower chamber, and terminates his reconstruction with a low sloping roof; compare the similar reconstruction in Mazois with Corinthian capitals and sloping roof; Gell's fiat-topped roof with antefixes; and Piranesi's two-storey Elévation et Coupe du Tombeau de Mamia avec ses restaurations. . . (Mazois 1824, 1, pl. 9; Gell 1817-19, pl. 19; Piranesi 1804-07 (1837), i, pl. 35). Flaxman's reconstruction also places pulvini, long cylindrical stone rolls, to either side of the sloping roof: they are usually found in a similar position on the flat tops of altars, examples of which exist on altar-tombs further north on the Street of Tombs (Kockel 1983, pls. 16, 27). This element derives from the broken marble pieces scattered around this area, which Kockel ascribes instead to the tomb of Porcius (Cat. no. 20); Flaxman includes a detail of one at the bottom right of this sheet, over a secondary pencil sketch of the tomb (Kockel 1983, pl. 8c, p. 53, see also pl. 35b). A view down the Street of Tombs from the Herculaneum Gate by Piranesi shows one of these pulvini fragments in situ (Piranesi 1804-07 (1837), 1, pl. 5). 200</page><page sequence="205">flaxman: ucl journal Flaxman depicts a cut-away view of the tomb showing its location on a terrace, with steps leading down to a walled courtyard ornamented with large tragic terracotta masks, two of which he draws as details; see also his sketches of architectural masks at Yale Sketchbook, ff. and 68r, and V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 27, also the note on plaster masks at f. I5r of this journal. The plan shows Flaxman's corrections to the number of niches for funerary urns on the inner walls of the tomb; see the identical plan in Saint-Non 1781-86, 11 (1782), pl. 76, opposite p. 120. Martyn, who visited shortly before Flaxman, gives this description of the tomb: 'it consists of a square court, on the walls of which are placed the skulls of animals sacrificed in funeral ceremonies, and large masks with weeping countenances and hollow eyes: the pile on which the bodies were consumed, stands in the center of the court, near a tower, where the urns were placed in niches'; Martyn 1787, pp. 290-91. Starke called the masks 'large frightful earthen masks with weeping faces'; Starke 1800, 11, p. 106. See also the very similar views of the tomb and its courtyard published in Saint-Non's Voyage Pittoresque (Saint-Non 1781-86, il (1782), pl. 81 opposite p. 133) and by Francesco Piranesi as Veduta del Sepolcro di Mamia negl'avanzi delV antica Città di Pompei (1789), both after drawings by the French artist Louis Jean Desprez, who was in Italy from 1776 to 1784. 25. (f. 34r) Two Doric capitals (Fig. 25) Graphite; pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; 213 x 159 Two similar but non-identical designs for Doric capitals, presumably from the three temple buildings at Paestum which were discovered almost whole in 1746; see also Cat. no. 1. The lower drawing seems to be a capital either from the first temple to Hera or the temple to Athena, known respectively in the eighteenth century as the Basilica and the temple to Ceres (see Piranesi 1778, pls. 5, 20), whereas the upper, unfinished sketch resembles the capitals to the second temple to Hera, then the temple of Neptune (Piranesi 1778, pls. 10,15). The Doric temples at Paestum were rare, famed and influential examples of ancient Greek architecture, made by a Greek colony founded around 600 bc (Black 2003, pp. 55-57). Flaxman was greatly taken with their simplicity compared to Roman remains, writing to William Hayley, 'the Temples are of the earliest Doric order the Columns thick fluted &amp; without bases the simple greatness of their affect . . . elevated &amp; delighted my mind more than all the other architecture I have seen in Italy, which have been raised under the auspices of Roman taste &amp; perfected in the elegance of Imperial corruption' (letter dated 17 July 1788, Flaxman Letterbook, f. 44r). To Romney he wrote, 'they are in better presentation than any ancient temple in Rome, except the Pantheon. The idea of each of these buildings is so simple, the larger parts so truly great, the small members done with so much feeling and delicacy that my mind was filled with the sublime of architecture' (letter dated 25 May 1788, quoted in Constable 1927, pp. 31-32). Alternatively, these may be worked-up sketches of capitals from the sixth-century bc 'Greek' or 'Doric' temple ruins in the Forum Triangulare at Pompeii, though these are in a much greater stage of decay and the detail might still in this case have derived from the temples at Paestum; see Donaldson 1827, 1, pl. 10. See the other sketches of capitals in this journal at Cat. nos. 17, 27-28. 26. (f. 35r) Plan of the Large Theatre and its colonnade, Pompeii (Fig- 26) Pen and grey ink over graphite; 134 x 216 Inscribed on diagram: The Theatre; below image: the quarter of the Soldiers The Large Theatre was built on Greek lines, according to Vitruvian principles which demanded a colonnade to shelter spectators during rain, and for theatrical preparations (Mau 1907, pp. 150, 157). The original colon- nade was later transformed into a gladiatorial barracks with training ground, and was used as such at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius (Mau 1907, pp. 160- 64; C. Parslow, in Dobbins and Foss 2007, p. 218). Flaxman has taken care to demarcate the separate rooms or cells added behind the colonnade, in some of which had been discovered a large number of weapons and armour (see f. I7r, note 27 and Cat. no. 14). At the time of his visit the inner area between the theatre and the colonnade was still largely covered by unexcavated and hilly ground, represented here by the dashed line; for a plan and view of the partially excavated area, see Saint- Non 1781-86, li (1782), pls. 84-85 (opposite pp. 138, 141). Nevertheless, Flaxman does not seem to have 201</page><page sequence="206">flaxman: ucl journal intended to copy exactly the number of columns, which are too many and unevenly matched, nor has he accurately recorded the dimensions of the space between the colonnade and the theatre. The four columns at the bottom mark the entrance to the colonnade from Stabian Street; one of the capitals to these columns (actually three in number) is at Cat. no. 28. 27. (f. 36r) Sketches including a sima (moulded cornice) with lion's head and palm decora- tions (Fig. 27) Pen and grey ink over graphite; graphite; 109 x 216 Flaxman's sketch of the lion's head and palmette sima is not readily identifiable, but it was probably one of many architectural terracotta fragments found in the Forum Triangulare at Pompeii, and thought to have formed part of the archaic Samnite decoration of the so-called Doric or Greek Temple which was there situated. In terms of surviving pieces, the composition of Flaxman's illustration resembles a polychrome sima with alternating lion's heads and rosette tondos, and the character of the heads approaches a grotesque lion's head waterspout, while numerous palm fragments derive from anthemions; see De Waele 2001, pp. 176-77, 186-87 (cat- nos- 287-89), pp. 301-02; also pp. 194-96, 249-50, 263-71. However, Flaxman's version is borne out by a similar design with alternating lion's heads and palmettes illustrated in publications by two near-contemporaries: Saint- Non, who gives it as a fragment of the sima to the Doric Temple, and Mazois, where it is suggested it was part of the decoration of the purgatorium to the Temple of Isis (Saint-Non 1781-86, 11 (1782), pp. 133-35, pl. 82e; Mazois 1824, IV, p. 33, pl. ioe). The latter suggestion has been rejected by recent researchers, who attribute the confusion to the similarly shaped gorgon's head antefixes from the roof of the purgatorium, as seen in Cat. no. 29 (Alla ricerca di Iside , 1992, pp. 8-10). Note also the description of a sima fragment with alternate lion's head and palmette decorations in the collections of the MNN, from the Temple of Apollo Lycio in Metaponto (Ruesch 191 1, i, p. 142). Interestingly, Flaxman drew a classicizing thirteenth-century cornice with a rather similar lion's head and acanthus ornament at S. Giovanni in Laterano, Rome; see the sketch at V&amp;A Sketch- book 2790, f. 42r. For an example of his own use of such decorative elements, see his monument to Elizabeth Ellis the elder at St George's, Esher, Surrey, erected in 1822 (Penny 1977, p. 25). The unrealized sketches are of the Ionic capital at Cat. no. 28 and the schola of Aulus Veius at Cat. no. 21. 28. (f. 37r) Ionic capital from the entrance to the Large Theatre's colonnade, Pompeii; a row of amphorae (Fig. 28) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; graphite; 127 x 208 Inscribed: Capital of a column in the Soldiers [sic] quarter / Pompeia [sic] A carefully rendered detail of an elegantly modelled Roman Ionic four-faced capital, from one of three columns at the entrance to the colonnade from Stabian Street; see also Cat. no. 26. These capitals greatly resemble those of the portico or propylaeum at the entrance of the Forum Triangulare, though the latter are set upon their columns in a much more pleasing fashion. Mazois praised the Forum portico highly, arguing that it had such taste, simplicity and grace that it must come from a time before Roman influence had extended to the art of Magna Grecia, and that the quality, elegance and sobriety of the capitals and other ornaments gave the ensemble a remarkable and noble character (Mazois 1824, in, pp. 17-22, pl. 9); see also Saint-Non 1781-86, 11 (1782), p. 139. An unrealized sketch of the capital is at Cat. no. 27; see also other capitals at Cat. nos. 17, 25. A faint sketch above shows a row of amphorae apparently propped against a wall, as they were frequently found and displayed in Pompeii. Often mentioned in this period were those in the cellar of the so-called Villa of Diomedes; see, for example, Martyn 1787, p. 292; Starke 1800, 11, p. 106. It is tempting to think that Flaxman may be playing on the formal correspondence between the row of amphorae and the egg-and-tongue modelling of the capital, but this may be stretching a point. 29.

Flaxman has removed the pillars at the front of the picture to give a clearer view, and restored the roof and the entablature of the colonnade, indicating his additions through the lack of shading or detail. It can, however, be noted that his reconstruction of the broken pillars at the sides of the portico obscures the actual remains of the large roofed side niches. The temple was rebuilt after the earthquake of ad 62 on the foundations of a previous model built in the early first century bc, and bears 'a marked deviation from ordinary types, as if the builders, erecting an edifice for the worship of foreign gods, strove with set purpose to produce a bizarre effect' (Mau 1907, pp. 169-71). Compared to most Graeco-Roman temples, it is also unusually small, secretive (it is enclosed by high walls) and theatrical, many visitors noting disapprovingly the hidden staircase for priests to enter and leave the cella, in order to create supernatural effects during ceremonies (A. M. Small, in Dobbins and Foss 2007, pp. 185-89; Starke 1800, 11, p. 101). The temple was much discussed as one of the earliest discoveries at Pompeii, Lalande remarking in an early account that it was a singular and curious experience to stand in a Roman temple with all its constituent parts (Lalande 1769, vu, p. 209). Despite the removal of many artefacts to Portici, the temple still appeared quite decorative and picturesque, as attested in this and the following drawing; Nancy Flaxman refers to it in her diary as a 'a Pretty Temple' and refers to this sketch (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 69r). The details of the palm and the two rather genteel female heads, actually gorgon masks, are terracotta antefixes from the roof gutter of the purgatorium, which is shown in more detail at Cat. no. 30 (Alla ricerca di Iside 1992, pp. 8-10, 71-72, fig. 4.3; Saint-Non 1781-86, il (1782), pl. 77, fig. f (opposite p. 124)). For other artists' views of the temple, see Saint-Non, which gives both the ruins and a reconstruction (Saint-Non 1781-86, 11 (1782), pls. 74, 75, 75 bis (opposite pp. 115, 117, 118)); Francesco Piranesi's Veduta del Tempio d'Iside . . . dell'antica Città di Pompei after Louis Jean Desprez, dated 1788; Gell 1817-19, pl. 68 (opposite p. 255), which also removes some of the pillars of the colonnade for a clearer view; and the ruins in Donaldson 1827, I, pl. 14. 30. (f. 39r) Two views of the purgatorium in the Temple of Isis, Pompeii (Fig- 30) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; pen and grey ink; 205 x 153 Inscribed: the front of the bath of purification with the great altar in the court of the Temple of Isis, Pompeia [sic] / Side of the bath of purification See Cat. no. 29. The purgatorium is an unroofed structure in the south-east corner of the enclosure of the Temple of Isis, with the great altar set before it; it housed steps leading to an underground chamber with a water tank and a pedestal supporting a bowl, probably containing holy Nile water (A. M. Small, in Dobbins and Foss 2007, p. 188; Mau 1907, pp. 178-79). At the time of Flaxman's visit it had antefixes on top of the side walls, but not on the gables at the ends; he has also increased the number of antefixes from Cat. no. 29, and extended the painted stucco frieze of priests and priestesses from the front to the side wall - the sides are actu- ally decorated with cupids and dolphins. Flaxman's attractive drawing gives quite a different impression of the temple to Martyn's opinion that the walls were covered in stucco ornaments 'executed in a coarse manner' (Martyn 1787, p. 289). Despite his inaccuracies, Flaxman is evidently interested in the stucco reliefs, which include the frieze, the figure of Isis before her altar in the upper design, and, in the lower design, the light relief of the flying couple and the cupids on the side of the building. Disregarding the reversal of the male and female figures, this is probably the west panel showing Mars and Venus, as opposed to the east wall with Perseus rescu- ing Andromeda (see Alla ricerca di Iside 1992, pp. 83-84, fig. 7.5). Flaxman later made specific reference to these decorative reliefs in his contribution to Rees' Cyclopaedia of the entry on 'Basso-relievo', viewing them in terms of the historical development of the art: 'Modelling in stucca, called plasticen by Pliny, was practised under the first emperors, with extraordinary beauty, freedom, and flight of execution; as may be seen in the ornaments of the bath of purification at the temple of Isis at Pompeia . . .' (Rees 1819, m). 31. (f. 40r) Reconstruction of 'the Temple of Jupiter Serapis', Pozzuoli (Fig- 31) Graphite; 153 x 209 A reconstructed view of the rotunda in the macellum (food market) at Pozzuoli, a pavilion which consisted of sixteen marble columns surrounding a platform 18.23 metres in diameter and supporting a conical roof or 203</page><page sequence="208">flaxman: ucl journal cupola, at the centre of a square court paved in marble. The discovery of a statue of Serapis led to the belief that the whole complex was a temple built to that divinity; it was in fact a remarkably large macellum conse- crated to Serapis as a result of the maritime city's trade links with Egypt (Maiuri 1947, pp. 17-28). On Flaxman's visit the rotunda would have consisted of the pedestals for the statues, the marble puteáis between the pedestals, and the sets of four steps leading up to the platform, as the columns and statues had been removed shortly after their discovery in 1750. For a plan and description, see Nixon, who suggests the low stands between the pedestals would have supported vases or lavers (Nixon 1757, pp. 168, 171). For a view of the ruins, see Saint- Non 1781-86, il (1782), pl. 5, opposite p. 167. The base was excavated further between 1809 and 18 16, giving a different appearance today from that shown here. The key to Flaxman's extremely detailed reconstruction may be Nancy Flaxman's instruction in her diary to 'see the Print' of the Temple for reference (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 65V). This may be Saint-Non's Elévation d1 un Temple antique que Von croit estre celui de Jupiter Serapis à Pouz zotes pres de Naples (1762; after Hubert Robert), a plate to Saint-Non's Griffonis series, to which Flaxman may well have had access (see note 33); Cayeux 1963, p. 329, cat. no. 34. (The plate was also reproduced in Saint-Non 1781-86, 11 (1782), pl. 6 (opposite p. 172).) Though from a different angle, the Saint-Non print gives a very similar view of the rotunda and shows statues on pedestals around the court, especially to the left and at the back, of which there are also faint suggestions in the present drawing. The ruins were one of the most visited sites of the Campi Phlegraei, many visitors presumably agreeing that, 'the ruins of the Temple of Serapis is the finest and most perfect antiquity at Puzzoli; yet it is a loss, greatly to be regretted by all lovers of antiquity, that the inner temple, discovered in the year 1750, and quite entire, highly decorated with several beautiful statues in marble and bronze, is not now to be seen, being filled up with the same earth which they took out of it' (Miller 1776, il, p. 311). 32. (f. 4ir) An amphora with twisted handles and a shallow dish (Fig- 32) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; graphite; 147 x 212 These are both likely to be Roman, though the shape of the amphora may be Greek. 33. (f. 42r) Draped statue (Fig. 33) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; 212 x 143 The statue is difficult to identify and does not appear in Reinach (1920-30; though see vol. 11, p. 665 for simi- lar figures). It is similar, if in reverse direction, both to a statue of a togatus found at the Street of Tombs, Pompeii (Kockel 1983, p. 173, pl. 63c), and to a herm (possibly a vestal) found in the Temple of Venus (excavated 1817; see Mazois 1824, iv, pls. 18-20), suggesting a particularly pious or memorial function. The drapery also recalls the spirit of several well-known marble statues then at Portici, such as the women of the Balbi family, particularly the Vidria Archade , mother of Balbus (see f. I4r), and the priestess Eumachia (MNN inv. no. 6210). See Flaxman's drawings of similar statues at Yale Sketchbook, f. 62r, and V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, pp. 133, 135. 34. (f. 43r) Flying female figure (Fig. 34) Pen and grey ink with wash over some graphite; 217 x 140 A flying female figure with folded arms and billowing drapery. This and the following two drawings represent a type of small flying or dancing female figure much used in Campanian wall-paintings, often characterized as bacchantes or maenads; see Flaxman's comments on a famous series in the museum at Portici at f. 25r. Note particularly from this series Bayardi 1757-92, m (1762), pls. 27 and 29, either of which could be the source for this figure. It is just as likely, however, to have been taken from one of the buildings at Pompeii, Nancy Flaxman noting among the wall paintings, 'some little flyg: figures very graceful' (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 69r). For figures remaining in situ on the walls, see Carratelli and Baldassare, in which, though this precise figure does 204</page><page sequence="209">flaxman: ucl journal not appear, there are some very similar designs (Carratelli and Baldassare 1990-96, 11 (1990), pp. 337, 474); note also Barré 1870-72, iv (1870), pl. 44. Flaxman naturally seized the opportunity to study these ancient examples of voluminous and fluid drapery, and they must have informed his own numerous uses of the flying female figure; see, for example, the Iliad, pl. 28. Note also his study of a similar figure of Victory from a gem, at V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 67. 35. (f. 44r) Flying female figure (Fig. 35) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite, an extra strip of paper glued on at right, 218 X 170 (with extra strip), or 156 (without) See Cat. no. 34. Flying female figure with billowing drapery, left arm outstretched. The figure may be based on Bayardi 1757-92, in (1762), pl. 28, one of the wall-paintings then already in the collections at Portici, al- though the specific folds and billows of the drapery are composed quite differently, and an extra strip of paper has been added at right for a flourish which certainly does not appear in this source. This would be slightly odd given the appreciative reception of these figures, expressed in one guidebook in the opinion 'that were an Art- ist to study for years he could not change one fold in the drapery to any advantage'; Starke 1800, 11, p. 118; see note 71 for further discussion. Barré (1870-72, iv (1870), pl. 33) suggests the MNN painting depicts a pecu- liarly noble and melancholy type of bacchante, though he adds that the convulsive and nervous movement of the drapery implies more abandoned and agitated movements; Flaxman's drawing by contrast seems much calmer. There are several faint pentimenti , but it is difficult to see what may originally have been intended. 36. (f. 45r) Flying female figure carrying fruit in a swathe of cloth (Fig. 36) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; 212 x 148 Inscribed on verso: painted on a Chamber wall in Pompeia [sic] / figure about a foot high See also Cat. nos. 34, 35. A version of a figure, perhaps Autumn, found in villas in regions I and VI of Pompeii, though neither of these were excavated until a later date; see Carratelli and Baldassare 1990-96, iv (i993)&gt; p. 294, il, p. 474; also Zahn 1828-59, n&gt; pls. 8, 47. The figure seems to have influenced Flaxman's study of a contemporary Roman woman dressed in billowing garments with the manuscript title A Roman Girl going to Church , from a sketchbook also made in Italy and now in private ownership (see Irwin 1979, pp. 48-50). 37. (f. 4ór) Cameo fragment with bacchic subject (Fig. 37) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; 156 x 210 The drawing shows a bas-relief of a reclining bacchante with a sharply turned back who proffers a bowl of wine towards the left, with a reclining satyr leaning against her thigh, and a child playing a double pipe to right, the three figures in a woodland setting beneath a canopy. The onyx cameo fragment is part of the Worsley collec- tion at Brocklesby House, Lincolnshire, and is illustrated in the Museum Worsleyanum in a plate entitled 'Ancient Greek Gems', where the same uneven, broken outline is evident; Worsleyanum 1824, 1, p. 144 and plate opposite; see also Hamilton Smith 1897, p. 39, no. 16. It is noted as coming from the 'Mantua Collection', i.e. the Gonzaga family, though it is likely it came to the Gonzagas from the Grimani family of collectors; see Venturelli 2005, pp. 60-61, 66-67. A letter from Flaxman to Romney dated 25 May 1788 mentions that Sir Richard Worsley was then residing in Rome, 'with several valuable bas reliefs he got in Greece', and Flaxman perhaps saw this cameo during a visit around that time, unless he copied the design from a separate cast; Constable 1927, p. 34. The satyr leaning back with one arm raised, snapping his fingers, recalls the pose of the Drunken Faun Flaxman admires at f. i9r. Flaxman draws a very similarly posed female figure, a nereid from a Sea Thiasos , at V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, ff. iov and 1 ir; see also his study of a similar bacchic scene at V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 5r. For other drawings after gems, see V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, pp. 59, 67, 69, 71. 38. (f. 47r) Domestic group with four women and a child (Fig. 38) Pen and grey ink with wash over graphite; 138 x 194 Inscribed on verso: on the wall of a house in Pompeia [sic] 205</page><page sequence="210">flaxman: ucl journal This composition cannot be identified from Carratelli and Baldassare, though the figures are characteristic of Pompeian painting; see, for example, Carratelli and Baldassare 1990-96, in (1991), p. 1018 (Mars and Venus), Bayardi 1757-92, 11 (1760), pl. 11 (a painting of three women conversing) and in (1762), pl. 7 (the well-known Seller of Cupids). Compare, too, the reversed version of the latter in Saint-Non's Griffonis , pl. 20 (dated 1773), which creates a similar effect with aquatint to the wash background here (Cayeux 1963, p. 362, cat. no. 258; see also note 33). Flaxman drew domestic groups of women and children throughout his life and would have been naturally drawn to such a scene, which perhaps led him to imbue the two figures to the left with more sentimentality than is usual in ancient painting, while the child seems entirely typical of his own work (see Bindman 1979, pp. 74, 125). The composition and the figures are very close to an undated Flaxman drawing of Christiana's reception in the interpreter's house, from the Pilgrim's Progress , though the figures of the latter seem far more modern and immediate both in grouping and dress (University College London, inv. no. G.653; see also a comparable sketch of five young women and a baby, G.762). Interestingly, Irwin (1979, p. 108) notes that Flaxman started work on the Pilgrim's Progress whilst on his Italian tour, and points to the close resemblance of some of its domestic scenes to the genre studies he made in Rome and elsewhere. A similar group appears to the far left of Flaxman's drawing of a sarcophagus relief at V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, ff. 22V and 23r. NOTES 1 Naples was famed for its theatrical opera (including comic opera); for the theatres, see Miller 1776, 11, pp. 364-68; Martyn 1787, pp. 260-61; and Starke 1800, 11, pp. 90-91. Nancy Flaxman's diary entries from Naples mention attend- ing the Teatro di San Carlo, the largest and most important of the theatres (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, ff. 64r and 64V). Editor's note: of the two versions of Mrs Mariana Starke's popular guidebook which have been consulted for the present study, the Letters from Italy (1800) is used in preference to the later Travels on the Continent (1820), but the latter is occasion- ally referenced for its revised and extended list of the Portici antiquities. 2 Prospective visitors to the museum at Portici (see note 6) were required to gain the permission of the King through the ambassador. An extra charge was expected by the Custodi on the separate floors, as can be seen further down in Flaxman's account list, though the permission entitled the visitor to admittance for a whole year. See Martyn 1787, pp. 281-82; Starke 1800, 11, pp. 117-18. 3 This could perhaps refer to products of the Capodimonte porcelain factory established in 1734, which included souvenirs representing the antiquities discovered nearby; T. Najbjerg, in Coates and Seydl 2007, pp. 63-65. 4 Nancy (Anne) Flaxman ( c . 1760-1820), Flaxman's wife. 5 Starke recommended ribbon to tourists in Naples as among the 'commodities best worth purchasing'; Starke 1800, il, pp. 337-39- 6 One of the royal palaces of the King of Naples, com- menced in 1738 at Portici, a coastline town between Naples and Resina, by Charles III of Spain (1716-88), then King of the Two Sicilies. The palace housed the museum of the recently discovered Herculaneum and Pompeian antiquities which, with several other collections, were gradually trans- ferred between 1787 and 1822 to the current MNN building in the Palazzo dei Vecchi Studi in Naples; Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 74-77- 7 The two marble statues known as the Equestrian Balbi (in the singular, Equestrian Balbus or Marcus Nonius Balbus ); see Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 158-61, cat. no. 12. Flaxman comments again and in greater detail on these statues on ff. 21-22; see note 59 for further discussion. It should be noted that Flaxman saw the statues before the head of the younger Balbus had to be replaced, in 1799. The younger figure, height 256 cm (MNN inv. no. 6105), and the elder, height 252 cm (MNN inv. no. 6211), were excavated from 1746 to 1747, and were traditionally described as father and son. Contrary to Flaxman's text, the Balbi sculptures were actually found in a Herculanean building sometimes called the Forum, though were for a long time thought to have been found in the so-called Basilica. The Theatre at Herculaneum, the site of the first Vesuvian discoveries, was the most accessible and famous of the early excavation sites: Flaxman visited it himself, commenting that it was the only visible structure remaining in Herculaneum after the rest of the underground area had been filled in (Flaxman Letterbook, f. 44r); for the early excavations see Parslow !995&gt; PP- 29, 42, 233. Flaxman's identification of the elder figure as the politician Appius Claudius is peculiar as no other commentator seems to have described it as such, not even his wife (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 67V), and also because he clearly read the inscription beneath the statue (see below, f. 22r). He may have remembered the name from other mon- umental inscriptions (see Venuti 1750, pp. 49-50, 58-60), or the Herculaneum painting at Portici now thought to be of Alcestus and Admetus , which had been thought The Judgement of Appius Claudius (MNN inv. no. 9027; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pl. 9, pp. 66-68; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 150-51, cat. no. 197). Appius Claudius featured in several accounts by earlier travellers to the region due to his building of the Via Appia, the great road connecting Rome to the south via Capua; see for example Venuti (as above), Northall 1766, pp. 269-79. Flaxman himself mentions him in relation to road and canal building in a letter to his father from Rome, dated 2 April 1788 (Flaxman Letterbook, f. 4ir). Bronze horse recomposed from several figures of a dam- aged quadrigae, Claudian age, height 216 cm, found near the 206</page><page sequence="211">flaxman: ucl journal Theatre at Herculaneum in May 1739 (MNN inv. no. 4904). This restored sculpture was praised by Mrs Starke as a 'beau- tiful horse in Corinthian brass' and counted by Winckelmann as a 'fine specimen. . . of a lighter breed' in an argument for the skill and beauty of ancient depictions of horses, for which see also f. 22r and note 59 (Starke 1820, p. 416; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 215). It features prominently in Desprez's imaginary procession of the Transport des Antiquités d 'Herculaneum, du Musoeum de Portici, au Palais des Etudes à Naples , marking it as one of the most notable and recognisable objects belonging to the museum at Portici, probably a result of the fame of its early discovery (Saint-Non 1781-86, 11 (1782), pl. 95 (opposite p. 54)). The head is particularly fine, others from the same quadrigae also surviving; see Flaxman's next comment. See Bayardi 1757-92, vi, (1771), pl. 66; Barré 1870-72, vi (1870), pl. 107; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. iio-ii, cat. no. 79. 9 See note 8. Bronze horse heads and other parts from the same quadrigae were discovered at several points in excavations between 1739 and 1872; see Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, il, pp. iio-ii, cat. no. 80 (MNN inv. no. 1 1 5391). The very thin and fine head, with the neck, was cast separately from the body of the horse; the surface was pre- pared with a layer of mercury and entirely covered with a thin layer of gold leaf, which was then burnished; Ward- Perkins 1978, II, pp. 208-09, cat. no. 300 (MNN inv. no. n 5390). See also Venuti 1750, p. 116; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, ili (1827), pl. 10; vignette to Bayardi 1757- 92, v (1767), pl. 67 (p. 227). 10 Marble statue of Vidria Archade , or Mother of Balbus (the proconsul), height 217 cm, Augustan age (MNN inv. no. 6168). One of four Julio-Claudian marble statues of women from the Balbi family in the Praxitelian 'grande ercolanese' sculpture style, found at Herculaneum in 1739. Lalande describes the statue of Vicina as veiled and draped in the grand manner, and says of the marble statues in general that the 'heads are ordinarily mediocre, but the draperies are worked with delicacy and with taste'; Lalande 1769, vu, p. 112. Starke awarded two exclamation marks each to two of the other female Balbi statues, omitting this statue from particular praise, but Martyn singles out the Mother of Balbus and adds that there are 'some others of inferior note'; Starke 1820, p. 412; Martyn 1787, p. 282. See Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, il, pp. 118-19, cat. no. no ( Viària Archade), cat. nos. 108-13 (Balbi family, with two male figures included); Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, 11 (1825), pls. 40-43; Barré 1870- 72, vi (1870), pls. 67-70, 78. This is likely to be the collection of monumental stone inscriptions found at Pompeii, Herculaneum and in excavations of the surrounding area, but may also include painted notices from the walls of the cities buried by Vesu- vius, both of which make up part of the extensive epigraphic collections of the MNN. Their historical importance in the identification of such sites as Pompeii, and prominence in eighteenth-century antiquarian debate, is attested by Venuti's comment that they were 'the most valuable Pieces of Antiquity'; Venuti 1750, p. 138; Mau 1907, pp. 27, 407-08, 485-90. 12 The MNN holds numerous altars, bases, sarcophagi and other stone and marble fragments; for a number of examples, see Ruesch 191 1, 1, pp. 9-26; Martyn 1787, p. 282. 13 A large number of extremely fragile carbonised papyri rolls were found in the excavation of the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum between 1752 and 1754, and were painstak- ingly unrolled at Portici and the manuscript copied by artists (see Flaxman's further comments on f. I5r and f. I7r, and note 24). The copies were engraved and published under the title Herculanesium voluminum quae supersunt collectio, in two editions between 1793 and 1876. Epicurean philosophical works by Philodemus of Gadara (died c. 35 bc) were unco- vered to the disappointment of antiquarians anticipating a lost library of classical authors, and generally accounted 'tedious, polemical, and unstylish in the extreme'; J. I. Porter, in Coates and Seydl 2007, pp. 95-114; see also Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 128-33; Gray 1794, pp. 414-15- 14 Bayardi 1757-92, vi (1771), the second volume of bronz- es from the prestigious, if much criticized official folio series of the Royal Herculaneum Academy (Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 74), illustrates female sculptures at pls. 67-83. Flaxman bought several parts from the series while in Italy; Irwin 1979, pp. 29, 222 (n. 7). Not all the figures have glass paste eyes, and it can be supposed from the comment 'grand &amp; simple' that Flaxman is particularly thinking of the five celebrated female figures variously thought to be Peplophores, Water Carriers or Dancers found at the Villa dei Papiri, Herculaneum (see note 40). These are severe, simply-draped archaicizing adaptations from the Greek, probably made around 50 bc after originals of the fifth century bc, height around 150 cm (MNN inv. nos. 5604, 5605, 5619-5621). See Bayardi 1757-92, vi (1771), pls. 70-74; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, il (1825), pls. 4-7; Barré 1870-72, vi (1870), pls. 93-95; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 130-31, cat. nos. 166-70. 15 See, for example, the variety of bronze vases illustrated in Ceci, pls. I, 2, 4, 5. Many visitors greatly admired the beauti- fully formed and skilfully decorated vases, lamps, candelabra and tripods found at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Although in the class of applied rather than high art, these objects of everyday use were seen as symptoms of an advanced, all- pervading aesthetic culture which neo-classicists sought to emulate, and were used by craftsmen literally as 'models for the very modern production of ornaments and tools' in the Grecian taste (Leopoldo Cicognara, 1818, quoted by F. Bologna, in Rediscovering Pompeii, 1990, p. 79). Winckelmann had anticipated this, arguing that 'as concerns ancient tools, and particularly vases, more attention should be paid to their ornamentation . . . An imitation of their taste could introduce a completely new style, and lead us away from ornate to natural decorations' (quoted by F. Bologna, in Rediscovering Pompeii, 1990, pp. 89-91). In his early account of the discoveries at Herculaneum, Bellicard illustrated several vases as objects of immediate interest to his readers, adding that such 'curiosities' could by their quality be assumed to have 'an affinity with the arts' (Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 47-56, pls. 20-22, 24, 25). Gray offers a slightly different viewpoint: 'The altars and the sacrificial vessels exhibit the parade of Paganism'; Gray 1794, p. 413. See also notes 19, 53, 56. 16 The MNN holds two bronze lectisterniae (couches of the gods) of similar design, first century ad, from Herculaneum. The decorations include silver inlays, mouldings in the shape of horses' heads, and bas-relief cartouches of Silenus, and 207</page><page sequence="212">flaxman: ucl journal were praised by Marty n and Starke; Martyn 1787, p. 283; Starke 1800, 11, p. 120.

At the time of Flaxman's visit these famously included those found in the House of the Surgeon at Pompeii, excavated in 1771, but also many from other sites in Pompeii, Herculaneum and the surrounding areas; see the catalogue and list of sites in Bliquez (1994, especially pp. xi- xii, 17-24, 80). Lalande commented that the instruments were ornamented in very good taste, and Bellicard that 'every one . . . had a brass handle, adorned with very curious workmanship'; Lalande 1769, vu, p. 124; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, p. 50. 18 For the collection of glassware, which includes vases, drinking glasses, dishes, lamps, small amphorae, lacrimatoires and necklace beads, some of which are coloured, see Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 218-29; Pesce 1932, pp. 5-7, 30-31. However, many grand tourists were more interested by pieces of first-century bc architectural plate glass discov- ered at Herculaneum and Pompeii, remarking on it in accounts both of the Portici collections and the excavated sites; see Venuti 1750, p. 141; Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 108-09; Miller 1776, II, p. 270; Martyn 1787, pp. 284, 290; Mau 1907, pp. 279, 357. The discovery of these panes fed the archaeo- logical debate on whether Romans had used glass in their windows, which had previously been denied by most anti- quarians; see Nixon 1758, especially pp. 604-05. It should be noted that the most celebrated glass object in the Museum, the blue glass vase from the villa of the same name in Pompeii, was not discovered until 1837; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 226-27, cat. no. 49. 19 See note 15. For the tremendous number and variety of terracotta and bronze lamps, see Bayardi 1757-92, vm (1792), the whole of which volume of this prestigious series is de- voted to lamps and candelabra, the lamps being illustrated in pls. 1-60; see also Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 1, pp. 198-99, cat. nos. 172-84; Barré 1870-72, vu (1870), pls. 1-62 (third series of bronzes, lamps and candelabra). 20 A large number of small terracotta cultic and domestic figures have been excavated in Southern Italy; they were popular and cheap decorative objects throughout the areas populated and traded in by the ancient Greeks, because the use of plaster and terracotta matrices by Greek craftsmen enabled mass production. By the third century bc, 'the mold was so pervasive a technique that it can be said to characterize ancient Greek terracotta production in general' (Uhlenbrock 1990, pp. 15-17). For examples of such matrices and the fig- ures produced using them, see Magna Grecia 1996, pp. 31-32, 82-83, 95~!07&gt; 255-58. Flaxman is very unusual among visi- tors to the MNN in mentioning these objects, reflecting both his own professional life as a sculptor and that of his father, who made plaster casts and models; Irwin 1979, p. 5. For the MNN's collection of architectural and decorative terracottas, see Ruesch 191 1, 1, pp. 141-49. 21 This probably refers to a group of fifteen almost life-size plaster theatrical masks found in Pompeii in 1749, which could have been used as models for actual masks. Roman theatrical masks were modelled to show great variety of physiognomy, character and emotion, but were made from highly degradable materials such as papier maché and rags, and are only known in the present day through reproduc- tions; see for example the decorative architectural masks Flaxman draws at Cat. no. 24. The English translators of the Antichità di Ercolano esposte (Bayardi 1757-92), in a list of objects to feature in future (unrealized) publications, give numbers 250 through to 270 to 'masks, in plaster'; Venuti mentions finds of 'Two Masks, the one of Marble, the other of baked Earth' and 'a pretty Mask of baked Earth' (Martyn and Lettice 1773, bcxi; Venuti 1750, p. 119). Six masks are illustrated in Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, vu (1831), pl. 44; an 1837 guidebook suggests that they could be architec- tural ornaments; Michel 1837, pp. 111-12; see also Monaco 1906, p. 33. I am indebted to Soprintendente Guzzo of the MNN for his description of this collection. 22 Bronze scales with weights modelled in shapes such as a pig, a goat, a cheese, heads and knucklebones, a variety of which are illustrated in Ceci, pl. 2; see also Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, i (1824), pl. 55; vm (1832), pl. 16; Barré 1870-72, vu (1870), pl. 96 of the third series of bronzes; Mu- seo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 192-93, cat. nos. 131-34. The weights were noted as 'beautifully ornamented with heads, &amp;c.' and for their 'delicacy of workmanship' (Starke 1800, II, p. 121; Miller 1776, il, p. 259). 23 Presumably measures of capacity, but possibly foodstuffs preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius (cf. f. i8r): see Giustiniani and Licteriis (1822, p. 63), 'a bottle with oil which is now dried up, and another with wine'; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, p. 102. 24 See also Flaxman's additional note on f. 14V, and note 13. Previous attempts having resulted in the destruction of the carbonized and almost unrecognizable papyri, Padre Antonio Piaggio (d. 1796) was brought from Rome in 1753 to unroll and decipher them, on recommendation from the Vatican (Parslow 1995, pp. 103, 344 (n. 79)). For his invention, which allowed the papyri to be unrolled at a rate of about a millime- tre an hour, see J. I. Porter, in Coates and Seydl 2007, pp. 104-05. Exhaustive descriptions are given in the near- contemporary accounts of Coxe 1815, pp. 318-19, and Engelbach 1815, pp. 158-61 (with annotated woodcut illus- tration). Flaxman demonstrates a common antiquarian impulse to record the ravaged appearance of the papyri rolls, as also seen in two hand-coloured plates in Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, XVI (1857), pls. 24-25. 25 The MNN holds many different items of writing equip- ment including papyri, ink pots, styli and wooden tablets in two or three sections (diptychs and triptychs); Franciscis 1968, p. 109. The well-known wax tablet receipts of L. Caecilius Jucundus were not unearthed until 1875; Mau 1907, p. 499. 26 Forsyth thought that the papyri were 'written incorrectly in squat capitals, with an admixture of CO and £, which nearly limits their date to the empire', though a later guide argued that the beauty and regularity of the characters of the papyri suggests they were written by copyists rather than original authors; Forsyth 1816, p. 288; Michel 18^7, P. IQS. 27 The MNN holds comprehensive collections of both military and gladiatorial armour, including, certainly in the present day, cuirasses. The plainer military armour, some from the Southern Italian tombs of Magna Grecia, includes bronze andromorphic greaves for the lower legs, as well as belts, harnesses and fibulae from shoulder straps. The specific 208</page><page sequence="213">flaxman: ucl journal 'Collection . . . found at Pompeia' is likely to be the com- plexly ornamented gladiatorial armour found within the colonnade of the Large Theatre (see Cat. no. 26), which is thought from this circumstance to have been used as gladiatorial barracks; Gell 1817-19, pp. 244-45; Mau 1907, pp. 162-63. The gladiatorial armour was highly decorated with figures in relief and linear patterns, as in Flaxman's reference to ocreae (greaves) with designs 'wrought into the muscles'. The particularly celebrated gladiatorial helmets belong to the oldest type of 'Samnite' gladiatorial armour, with visors and holes guarded by network for the eyes, and were worn in parades; Flaxman draws one ornamented with scenes of the destruction of Troy at Cat. nos. 14 and 15. He displayed a consistent interest in the different forms of ancient armour, as seen in his later contribution to Abraham Rees' Cyclopaedia of the entry on 'Armor or Armour', which mentions the Pompeian discoveries (Rees 1819, 11); further on in his tour, this is likely to have been spurred by the need to depict battle scenes in his illustrations to Homer.

For the Column of Trajan, c. ad 112- 13, with its continu- ous spiral decoration of military scenes in relief, see Kleiner 1992, pp. 212-20. For the Arch of Constantine, composed ad 312-15 but using material from much earlier sculptures, notably from the Great Trajanic Frieze, see Kleiner 1992, pp. 444-55. In his ninth lecture (Ancient Art) as Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy, Flaxman commended these works to students as supplying the 'true principles of compo- sition', though Irwin points out that he had also previously argued in the sixth lecture ( Composition ) that they and other Roman compositions were 'mere paragraphs of military gazettes! vulgar in conception, ferocious in sentiment', and lacked the 'epic' Greek spirit; Irwin 1979, p. 214; Flaxman 1829, pp. 288, 167. 29 In England, faceguards perforated with sights became common only after 1200, and movable vizors appeared from the mid-fourteenth century. The development of powerful guns in the late sixteenth century led to the eventual aban- donment of untenably heavy armour, and though cuirassier armour and morions were still worn into the 1620s and during the Civil War, by this point most soldiers had dispensed with complicated helmets in favour of a simple skull-cap. If Flaxman means here to make a particular comparison with the helmet illustrated in Cat. nos. 14 and 15, it may be noted that embossed relief figures in the classical style (via the Italian High Renaissance) were not common before the 1520s, and that the English early Tudor burgonet, a helmet with some similarity to the gladiatorial helmet of Cat. nos. 14 and 15, was purposely built on 'pseudo-antique lines'. See Kelly and Schwabe 193 1, 1, pp. 51-59; n, pp. 67-75; Blair 1958, pp. 143-44, 176. See also Sir William Hamilton, quoted in Saint- Non 1781-86, II (1782), p. 138, and Donaldson 1827, 1, p. 41, who both make similar comments to those expressed here by Flaxman. 30 Andromorphic bronze cuirass, British Museum, Depart- ment of Greek and Roman Antiquities (inv. no. 1 772,0303 . 1 40. a,b). Part of the defining collection of antiquities purchased by the British Museum in 1772 from Sir William Hamilton, British envoy to the Kingdom of Naples and the Two Sicilies in 1764-98; see Jenkins and Sloan 1996, p. 7. 31 The MNN's extensive collection of coins and medals was at the time of Flaxman's visit in two locations. The coins from Pompeii, Herculaneum and other local excavations (in 1787 numbering 4,317 coins, not counting duplicates and superfluous pieces) were kept at Portici, while the Farnese collection was at Capodimonte, to which Flaxman refers on f. 27r; see note 86 for further comments (Fiorelli 1870-72, I, foreword). Visitors to the Portici collection seem to have particularly admired a gold medal of Augustus, struck in Sicily in the fifteenth year of his reign, and a triumph of Vespasian struck upon the taking of Jerusalem ('Judaea capta'); Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 126-27; Miller 1776, 11, p. 269; Martyn 1787, p. 282. Flaxman's specific interest in imperial Roman coinage, with its inevitable emphasis on portraiture, reflects a common historical and antiquarian approach, as well as the strength of the MNN's collections in this area; see Moussinot 1748, pp. 43-47; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, p. 67. 32 Silver mirror with bas-relief on the obverse of a seated, dying woman attended by a putto and a serving woman, 18 cm in diameter, first century bc to the first century ad, found at Pompeii, March 1758 (MNN inv. no. 25490). The scene is now generally believed to be the Death of Phaedra , but has often been described as that of Cleopatra; see Bayardi 1757-92, v (1767), pp. 257-67, pl. 1; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, XVI (1857), pl. 12; Barré 1870-72, vu (1870), pl. 100; Pesce 1932, pp. 32-33; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 212-13, cat- no- 45- 33 The mirror back is shown in reverse on a sheet numbered 16 and lettered du Musoeum de Portici, from a series of eighteen known plates etched by Saint-Non illustrating antiquities from various museums (see p. 53 of the present volume). The series forms part of Saint-Non's Recueil de Griffonis, de Vues Paysages, fragments antiques et Sujets historiques gravés . . ., the title-page of which gives the publication date as 1 763 . A second and rare title-page, which can be assumed to belong to the series in question, gives a plausible approximation of Flaxman's abbreviated title: Suite de dix-neufs feuilles d'après l'antique, consistant en figures, médallions, bas-reliefs, autels, trépieds, vases et quantité d'instruments à l'usage des anciens dont plusiers sont de l'invention de Robert. A Paris, chez la Voye .... Even if this is not the correct title-page, it is likely that Hubert Robert, a French artist in Italy 1754-65 who was to work repeatedly with Saint-Non, drew all the designs for the series, as he is named on several of the plates. See Cayeux 1963, especially pp. 330-35 (the mirror is cat. no. 57e), 322-24, 327. 34 The 'altar' with 'Jupiter' and the eagle is a silver calathus in the shape of a mortar, decorated with a relief of the Apotheosis of Homer, 12.5 x 14.7 cm, Augustan-Tiberian age, found at Pompeii (MNN inv. no. 25301). The poet is borne by an eagle and flanked on the left by a seated warrior repre- senting the Iliad, on the right by a seated sailor representing the Odyssey. Winckelmann believed it to be the apotheosis of Homer, though there were other interpretations including an apotheosis of a Caesar; it is interesting that Flaxman did not recognize the supposed subject of his most famous work for Wedgwood, which he had designed a decade earlier; 209</page><page sequence="214">flaxman: ucl journal Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 355 n. 116; Caylus 1752-67, 11 (1756), pp. 120-21 and pl. 41; Bindman 1979, pp. 56-57, cat. no. 32. An MNN guide considers the Homer among 'the most beautiful examples' of ancient silver in the museum, and that 'the execution is the best conceivable in ancient decorative art'; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, pp. 107-08. See also Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 210-11, cat. no. 35. The other 'altar' could perhaps be a silver calathus with a relief of an amazonomachy, showing a running Amazon and Theseus seizing a girl by her hair; Augustan, 11x13.3 cm, from Pompeii (MNN inv. no. 111149); Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 210-11, cat. no. 36. 35 Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, vu (1831), pl. 48, illus- trates several silver fibulae with both incised and bas-relief designs, including one with a quadriga resembling Flaxman's sketch; see also Barré 1870-72, vii (1870), pl. 95. 36 Material fragments found at Pompeii include cord-soled shoes made from esparto grass, cloth, linen, silk, cord pieces, threads, fishing nets, lamp wicks, tortoiseshell and cork pieces; see Monaco 1906, p. 70; Franciscis 1968, p. hi. Several com- mentators mention 'gold lace', commonly understood as an ornamental braid or trimming for coats made of thin wires of gold, sometimes as an outer layer around a silk braid ('gold lace without silk, found in Herculaneum, which no other museum can boast of, Giustiniani and Licteriis 1822, p. 63; see also Lalande 1769, vu, p. 123; Martyn 1787, p. 284). This suggests gold necklaces such as can be seen in Museo Nazion- ale Napoli 1989, il, pp. 81, 214-15, cat. no. 64 (MNN inv. no. 25260), and Magna Grecia 1996, p. 239. Many of the fine pieces of jewellery in the MNN were found in Italiote tombs, often characterized in Flaxman's time as 'Etruscan' - see the note on the silver inlaying of armour on f. i8r; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, p. 75. 37 The MNN holds a variety of perfume vases, strigils, combs, hairpins, thimbles, toothpicks and other such articles, made of bone, bronze and ivory; Monaco 1906, pp. 73, 94. The rouge pot of rock-crystal (MNN inv. no. 77570) is illustrated, with various other items, in Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, IX (1833), pls. 14-15; see also Barré 1870-72, vu (1870), pls. 87, 91, 93. Lalande comments that the rouge pot is just like those used by modern French women; Lalande 1769, vu, p. 123. 38 The quantity and variety of carbonized food found at Pompeii highlighted the seemingly instantaneous and complete preservation of this ancient city. The curious round loaf of bread stamped with the words 'Segilo e granii' and 'E. Cicere' was noted by many of the visitors, and enjoyed an early celebrity as one of the few illustrations in Bellicard's account of the recent finds displayed at Portici; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 49-50, pl. 20C. Nancy Flaxman noted it in her diary, and Lalande wondered why the ancients had not invented printing, if they had known how to stamp letters into bread; Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 68r; Lalande 1769, vu, p. 118. See also Moussinot 1748, p. 50; Starke 1800, 11, p. 120; Monaco 1906, p. 70; Franciscis 1968, p. no. 39 Artist's pigments in pots from a colourman's shop at Pompeii; see Monaco 1906, p. 68; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 200-01, cat. nos. 197-98; Rediscovering Pompeii 1990, pp. 154-55- 40 The Drunken Faun, bronze statue with paste eyes, Roman copy of a late Hellenistic original, c. second century bc, height 137 cm, found in the grand peristyle of the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum, July 1754 (MNN inv. no. 5628). See Bayardi I757-92? vi (1771), pls. 42-43; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824- 57, il (1825), pl. 21; Barré 1870-72, vin (1872), pls. 32-33; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, p. 55; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, il, pp. 126-27, cat. no. 155. Contrary to Flaxman's opinion of its youth, this older satyr was probably intended as a contrast to the young Sleeping Faun (described by Flaxman below), with which it was paired in the Villa dei Papiri, across the water bath. This villa and the Dionysiac sculpture arrangement in its garden contributed many of the most significant bronzes seen by Flaxman on his visit to Portici, including the five Peplophores (f. I5r), the wrestlers or runners, two small deer and the statuette of a faun (f. 2or), and the busts of philosophers and other famous men (f. 26r), as well as a Seated Mercury and the infamous erotic sculpture of Pan with a goat, neither of which are mentioned here ( Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 126-27, cat. nos. 156, 154), and of course the carbonized papyri rolls (f. 14V etc.); Capelli !999&gt; PP- 85-88. The modelling of the faun's body is extremely naturalistic and the anatomy of the muscles, veins and tendons detailed (though the face is somewhat mask-like), which led to it being one of the most admired objects at Portici before the arrival of the Farnese sculptures. Winckelmann believed that it and the Sleeping Faun were among the best bronzes he had ever seen, though he thought the 'most superb' at Portici to be the Seated Mercury (Haskell and Penny, 1981, pp. 267-69, cat. no. 62), which is oddly neglected here; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 249-50. The sculpture was given an exclamation mark by Starke, and praised by Martyn alongside the Sleeping Faun , the Wrestlers and the Seated Mercury ; Starke 1820, p. 417; Martyn 1787, p. 282. Flaxman was similarly struck by the sculpture's quali- ties on viewing a plaster cast at Milan, as can be seen from BL Journal, f. 2ir: 'particularly the Faun snapping his fingers &amp; the sitting Mercury are so exquisitely beautiful &amp; natural they feek seem to have been cast from Nature'. 41 Bronze statue of the Sleeping Faun , one of several replicas of a Hellenistic original, made in the second quarter of the third century bc, height 142 cm, found in March 1756 in the grand peristyle of the Villa dei Papiri, Herculaneum (see note 40) (MNN inv. no. 5624). The marble Barberini Faun is the best-known version (Haskell and Penny, 1981, pp. 202-05, cat. no. 33), from which this differs in the small horn-like growths on its neck. See Bayardi 1757-92, vi (1771), pl. 40; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, x (1834), pi- 61; Barré 1870-72, vi (1870), pl. 62; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 126-27, cat. no. 153. Although Venuti also thought nearly all the marble bas-reliefs were 'so trifling that they are not worth speaking of, he and several other commentators did admire a particu- lar piece ('the only one of any Value') of a sacrifice with three figures, one a seated man with a cloak wrapped around his legs and covering his entire head; Venuti 1750, p. 78; see Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, v (!829), pl. 23. Though this does not entirely accord with Flaxman's description, the figure's drapery and intense attitude seem likely to have appealed to him, from his use of similar figures in some of his later funerary monuments (Whinney and Gunnis 1967, cat. nos. 75, 96, 113). Lalande too thought the piece of great beauty, saying the relief was handled very well; Lalande 1769, 210</page><page sequence="215">flaxman: ucl journal vu, p. 84. It was the only bas-relief sketched by Bellicard in his Italian notebook, featuring later in his early account of the museum at Portici, and was also praised by Moussinot; Gordon 1990, fig. 22 and p. 74; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pl. 14e and p. 74; Moussinot 1748, pp. 42-43. It is also possible that Flaxman refers to one of a number of funerary steles with bas-reliefs of an old man wrapped in a cloak: see Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 152-53, cat. nos. 274-75 (MNN inv. nos. 151258, 15 1257), both with Greek writing; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, xiii (1843), pl. 21. These are less well handled, but the ancient funerary monuments would have been of obvious interest (see his drawing of a similar relief of two women at Y ale Sketchbook, f. 53r), and they are slightly suggestive in pose of some of his later funerary bas-reliefs, particularly the monument to the poet William Collins (Whinney and Gunnis 1967, cat. no. 41). For the marble bas-reliefs in general, see Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, il, pp. 98-99, 148-53; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, IV (1827), pls. 9, 24, 53. Statue of Artemis , sometimes called the Etruscan Diana , pentellic marble with traces of colour, archaicizing Augustan Roman copy of a Greek model, height 108 cm, found in the garden of a Pompeian house in region VIII, 1760 (MNN inv. no. 6008). The traces of colour on the face, hair, clothing and plinth include a fine pink and yellow border to the drapery; Ward-Perkins 1978, 11, p. 147, cat. no. 82. The statue is an instance of the trend favouring archaic forms and was made in the first century bc; Capelli 1999, pp. 24-25. Lady Anna Miller praises the statue as 'elegant . . . draped after the purple gown worn by the Roman ladies of antiquity; the garment is edged with a lace exactly resembling point', and Starke awards it an exclamation mark for interest; Miller 1776, 11, p. 255; Starke 1820, p. 412. The awkward archaicism of the sculpture is not entirely felicitous, however, and its curiosity lies in the colouring; Winckelmann used it repeatedly in his discussions both of ancient clothing and the early painting of marbles; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 116, 164-66, 224, 226. See Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, 11 (1825), pl. 8; Barré 1870- 72, vi (1870), pls. 76-77; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 146-47, cat. no. 257. Mosaic of Phryxus and Helle, iv style, 89 x 150 cm, found at Stabiae in the Villa di San Marco (MNN inv. no. 10005); Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, I, pp. 122-23, cat. no- 48. The floors of the museum at Portici were paved with ancient mosaics discovered at Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabiae, which Martyn and Starke thought very beautiful, but did not impress Lalande, who wrote that they were not worth detail- ing, or Venuti, who called them 'very ordinary'; Starke 1820, p. 422; Martyn 1787, pp. 284-85; Lalande 1769, vu, p. 149; Venuti 1750, p. 109. Moussinot thought the 'considerable' number of mosaics were without taste, design, variety or nuance of colour, and were very crudely executed; Moussinot 1748, p. 39. It should be noted that the particu- larly famous and beautiful mosaics from the House of the Faun at Pompeii, including the sea creatures, animals of the Nile and the battle between Alexander and Darius, were not uncovered until the years leading up to 1832 (Mau 1907, p. 27). 45 Mosaic of street musicians, a theatrical scene from the Theophoroumene (The possessed girl) of Menander. Emblema in vermiculatum, laid in a marble tray; one of two small mosaics in the MNN signed on the stone by Dioskourides de Samo, made c. 100 bc and influenced by Hellenic art of the third century bc, 43 x 41 cm, found at the so-called Villa of Cicero, Pompeii, April 1762 (MNN inv. no. 9985). The 'sieve' is actually an instrument similar to a tambourine, and the 'little girl' a small male servant figure, a boy or perhaps a dwarf. An emblema is a self-contained panel that can be set into the centre of a mosaic, and the use of marble for the tray suggests it was made in Greece and then transported to Pom- peii, rather than at a local Hellenistic centre of production. It is very fine technically, composed of tesserae 0.1-0.25 cm2, with the visible mortar tinted to maintain a consistent colour. The complex colouring appears to shimmer, particularly in the drapery: a 'painting in stone', it also conforms to some of the principles of ancient bas-relief in that the figures are all on the same plane, distinct from a minimally indicated back- ground; Dunbabin 1999, pp. 38-47. Winckelmann thought it valuable for the rare appearance of the artist's name, and 'inimitable' in the fineness of the work, commenting, 'the tiny little stones forming the ground of this picture are of the size of the point of a quill, and they decrease in size in the figures until they are no longer visible to the naked eye; even the hairy eyebrows of the masks are delineated'; Winckel- mann 1764 (2006), pp. 339-40. See also Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, IV (ï827), pl. 34, which notes that it is highly lauded; Monaco 1906, p. 12: 'one of the finest pieces in the collection, being full of action and life'; Barré 1870-72, in (1870), pl. 124; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 1, pp. 29, 116-17, cat. no. 1; Capelli 1999, pp. 38-39.

See Flaxman's drawing of a rather reminiscent faun playing a double pipe at V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 113, in a section of the sketchbook detailing several Etruscan bronze statuettes. 47 This is probably a bronze statuette of Jupiter found at Her- culaneum, illustrated in Bayardi 1757-92, vi (1771), pl. 1, though see also four further examples in pl. 2.

The original, from the armour, can be dated to the last decade of the fourth century bc.

Winckelmann described this piece in detail in an argument on the ancients' skill in depictions of horses, and said that it 'should be counted among [Portici's] rarest pieces', writing further that this and the accompanying horse were both 'worked in the most beautiful form and in the finest way'; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 215.

Two bronze deer recomposed from several fragments, Roman copies of Greek originals, late Hellenistic, from the third quarter of the second century bc, heights 96 and 98 cm (MNN inv. nos. 4886, 4888).

One of many examples of vases with detailed figures on the handles; see Barré 1870-72, vii (1870), pl. 75, where the handles are described as novel and bizarre; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, vu (1831), pl. 15; Ceci, pl. 6, fig. 37; see also note 15.

These were displayed as examples of Roman technical and engineering capacity: Lalande, among other visitors, was taken by their 'rather ingenious form'; Lalande 1769, vu, p. 119. 55 A pair of statues of a masked actor in the character of a tragic youth and a masked actress as a tragic courtesan, terracotta with traces of bright paint, heights 115 and 1 1 1 cm, perhaps Augustan, discovered at Pompeii around 1762 (MNN inv. nos. 22248, 22249).

See Bayardi 1757-92, vm (1792), the whole of which volume of the prestigious series is devoted to lamps and candelabra; the celebrated candelabra are illustrated from pl. 60 onwards, pls. 60-62 and 71 in particular giving exam- ples of the cane or tree shape. See also the lamps and cande- labra in Barré 1870-72, vii (1870), pls. 1-62 (third series of bronzes), pls. 1, 2 and 10 having organic and/or plant-like forms; pl. 26 is formed as a cane. Mercier-Dupaty particu- larly admired the taste and imagination of the candelabra, and also singled out an example drawn from nature: 'at the extremity of a table of bronze, rises the trunk of an old tree; it has already lost its leaves, and its branches are on the point of falling . . .'; Mercier-Dupaty 1788, p. 316; see also Ceci, pl. 3, which illustrates this last at fig. 2. Some of the victims of Vesuvius were covered with ash that formed a solid shell around the body, retaining the form of the body after it had decomposed. The technique of making plaster casts of the bodies (some of which can still be seen today) was invented by Giuseppe Fiorelli in 1863; Flaxman instead saw pieces cut from the hardened ashes which had been discovered around skeletons. This woman was one of the twenty or more victims found in the cellar of the so-called Villa of Diomedes at Pompeii during its 1771- 74 excavation, 'of whose flesh there remained nothing but an impression in the earth ... Of their clothing there was noth- ing but ashes to be found, but these preserved the texture of the material which had surrounded their forms, permitting one to distinguish very clearly the fineness of the weave and the weight of the fabric' (G. Fiorelli in his Pompeianarum antiquitatum historia (Naples, i860), trans, by E. Dwyer, in Coates and Seydl 2007, p. 175). The director of this excava- tion sent sixteen pieces to Portici, where the evidence of the clothing contributed to a growing sentimentality about the pagan victims of the disaster, whose perceived immorality had previously allowed their deaths to go largely unlamented; for a full account, see E. Dwyer, in Coates and Seydl 2007, pp. 171-80. Mercier-Dupaty was struck by this, 'one of the greatest curiosities' in the museum, on his visit in 1785: '. . . a compleat mould ... in the pieces here preserved we see a perfect impression of the different parts to which it adhered. One represents half of her bosom, which is of exquisite beauty; another a shoulder, a third a portion of her shape, and all concur in revealing to us that this woman was young, and that she was tall and well made, and even that she had escaped in her shift: for some pieces of linen are still adhering to the ashes'; Mercier-Dupaty 1788, p. 320. 58 Nancy Flaxman in her diary praises the beauty and smallness of horses the couple saw in Naples: 'I never saw 212</page><page sequence="217">flaxman: ucl journal Prettier little creatures in my life'; Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 6ir. Northall wrote that 'Neapolitan horses are highly esteemed throughout all Europe'; Northall 1766, p. 180. See Flaxman's sketch of a horse, thought to be from life, at Yale Sketchbook, f. 78V. 59 See earlier reference on f. I5r, and note 7. The Flaxmans were evidently extremely taken with the horse. Nancy Flaxman writes in her diary that of all the works in Portici, she 'principally' remembers the 'very simple and natural' Equestrian Balbi (Mrs Flaxman 1787-88, f. 67V), and she also records two further visits to Portici at the outset of trips, strongly suggesting the couple were stopping by to see the Balbi in particular: on the way to Paestum and Pompeii on the 12 February, 'we stopp'd at Portici a few minutes to see our old friends in the court yds of the Royal Castle [;] delighted anew with the horses mouth which seem'd alive' (f. 68 v); on the way to Vesuvius, 22 January, a 'friendly look' in on the statues in the '2 courtyds' at Portici (f. 70v). Their interest was doubtless heightened by the rarity of marble equestrian fig- ures, a point remarked by Lalande; he himself commented that 'the horse's head is full of fire . . . above all reigns a great character of truth, so that one could say the marble breathes'; Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 77-81. Venuti suggested it was 'made (no doubt) by a Grecian Artificer . . . you may plainly discern the Veins, and Muscles, the Posture, &amp; mettle of the Steed'; Venuti 1750, pp. 135-36. Conversely, Bellicard thought the horse lacked proportion and was inferior to its rider, and Lady Anna Miller thought it 'does not seem sufficiently in move- ment'; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 92-93; Miller 1776, il, p. 254. Winckelmann was critical in his Reflections of antique statues which did not depict 'the handsomer varieties' of animals, or the proper diametrical movement of horses' legs, but he later argued, as here, against those who did not think the ancient artists 'had just as much insight as Horace and Virgil did in showing us the virtues and beauties of a horse', and praised as examples the bronze horses mentioned in this journal at ff. I4r and 2or. See Winckelmann 1765 (1972), pp. 55-56; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 214-16. Flaxman repeated in very similar terms his argument that the ancients were excellent sculptors of animals, both in a letter to Romney from Rome, dated 25 May 1788, in which he praised the Vatican animal sculptures as 'every thing but alive', and in his lecture on Science, where the Vatican animals are again mentioned, in the company of the horses from the Parthenon frieze; Constable 1927, p. 33; Flaxman 1829, pp. 103^04. 60 The uniquely vast collection of ancient paintings taken from the walls of Pompeian and Herculanean buildings were nonetheless a source of frustration to eager Classicists who thought them technically deficient, and 'works of a period in which truly good taste did not prevail' (Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 260-61). Particularly criticized were the architec- tural paintings (e.g. Bayardi 1757-92, 1 (1757), pls. 39~44; Barré 1870-72, 1 (1870), pls. 1- 41; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 126-31, 142-43), for their supposed 'bizarre' and 'wretched' mixture of Gothic, Arabic and Chinese styles; see for example Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 82-87; Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 147-48; Miller 1776, II, p. 280. The 'theatrical' paintings could either be masks in ornamental or architec- tural settings (see Bayardi 1757-92, iv (1765), pls. 33~42)&gt; or theatrical scenes such as Bayardi 1757-92, 1 (1757), pl. 4. In terms of the 'marine views', many agreed with Starke's assess- ment of 'a naval combat, ill done, but curious, because it shows the ancient galleys, and the mode of fighting them'; Starke 1800, 11, p. 122; see for example Bayardi 1757-92, 1 (1757)» pls. 45, 46. Flaxman's comments are very close to the following passage from the English translation of Bayardi: 'the painters, or rather ornamenters, intended, perhaps, no more . . . than to cover the wall with something that was pleasing . . . without giving themselves the trouble to sketch out plans of real buildings . . . and to put them into true per- spective'; yet, 'there is in these pieces, a liveliness of imagina- tion, accuracy in the execution, freedom of pencil, and so much spirit in the touches ... as renders them, at least, very pleasing'; Martyn and Lettice 1773, pl. 39. Pears notes that the status of house-painters in Britain declined in the post-baroque era due to the simplification of interior decorative schemes, so that by the mid-eighteenth century the majority of the trade were thought of as work- men who, after skilled 'artists' had contributed a few pieces, carried out 'the remainder of the work . . . working of neces- sity on the site, with much less need or opportunity for performing tasks which required artistic accomplishment'; Pears 1988, pp. 1 15-17. 61 See Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, I, pp. 164-65. Despite the relatively low standing of still life and animal painting in eighteenth-century aesthetic discourse, the beauty and naturalism of the MNN's ancient works in these genres was often remarked, and several were illustrated in full plates in the prestigious Antichità di Ercolano esposte series: see Bayardi 1757-92, i (1757), pl. 45; il (1760), pls. 56-58; hi (1762), pl. 54; vu (1779), pl. 62, etc.; Ward-Perkins 1978, 1, pp. 74, 76. Blondeau described some pieces as 'exquisitely done', and Mercier-Dupaty thought 'the fruits and flowers appear as if just gathered'; Blondeau 1749-50, p. 20; Mercier-Dupaty 1788, p. 328. Both Cochin and Thomas Martyn thought the technical accomplishment of these small pieces preferable to the large historical narratives. Martyn found the composition, design and colouring of the latter 'in general very indifferent', and Cochin argued that the still lives and animal paintings 'are the best of any yet found, being executed with taste and ease; yet they are for the most part unfinished, and have not always the necessary rounding and exactness . . . pretty true in colour and effect, though want strength in either'; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 78-79; Martyn 1787, pp. 285-86. 6 Megalographic painting known as Theseus and the Minotaur or Theseus the liberator, the figure of Theseus very large in proportion to the Athenian youths he has saved, iv style, 194 X 155 cm (MNN inv. no. 9049). This piece and the four mentioned directly afterwards were all taken from the building in Herculaneum now thought to be a porticus (previously called the Basilica) which was excavated in 1738, and are discussed in T. Najbjerg, in Coates and Seydl 2007. She suggests the Porticus was a school for iuvenes redeco- rated in the reign of Vespasian, c. ad 69-79, and draws attention to shared themes in the decorative scheme which would surely have appealed to Flaxman's moral sensibilities: the strength of Hercules, the trials and triumphs of virtuous young heroes, and the care and education of children; T. Najbjerg, in Coates and Seydl 2007, pp. 67-68, see also Little 1964, pp. 393-95- 213</page><page sequence="218">flaxman: ucl journal The Theseus was one of the most noted of the Hercula- neum paintings, though it attracted many of the criticisms aimed at the whole of the oeuvre. Cochin and Bellicard's account included an early sketch and praise for the 'very good character in the head' of Theseus; the composition, however, was 'very cold', having been taken from a statue, and included two children 'in attitudes which are very common in the basso relievo of the ancients', though the foreshortened Minotaur appeared more original; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pl. 6 and pp. 60-62; see similar comments in Lalande 1769, vu, p. 139, and Engelbach 1815, pp. 169-70.

See note 67 for further comments on the Porticus paintings. 63 Hercules and Telephus; painting of Telephus suckled by a hind, watched by Hercules who looks over his shoulder, both before a seated female figure thought to represent Flora; iv style, 218 x 182 cm, from the Porticus at Herculaneum (see note 62) (MNN inv. no. 9008). A copy after the painting by Apelles of Hercules turning round, which was mentioned by Pliny; Capelli 1999, p. 77. Criticism included Winckelmann's objection that the figure of Hercules 'looks like no Greek Alkeides, and the remaining heads are common', and Cochin's typically exacting approach: 'the picture is poorly designed and shows very little knowledge in drawing and expression. The heads are middling, the hand ill executed, and the feet altogether as incorrect'; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 253; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pl. 7 and pp. 62-64. Lady Anna Miller gave faint praise: 'Flora is well draped, the child, how- ever, is particularly incorrect in the drawing, and the lion and eagle but ill done'; Miller 1776, 11, p. 277.

The compositions of the Chiron and Achilles and the Marsyas and Olympus mentioned immediately after (see note 65) were taken from statues that would have been well known to the ancients from the Saepta Julia at Rome; Little 1964, pp. 393-95. This painting was generally thought the best of the Herculaneum 'history' paintings, Winckelmann among many others particularly admiring it for the figure of the boy: 'Achilles stands quiet and calm, yet his face gives one a lot to think about'; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 253-54. Some admired the painting despite finding fault with the centaur: Cochin criticized the anatomy of the latter, while praising the figure of Achilles as having 'a good deal of truth and nature'; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pl. 8 and pp. 65-66; see also Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 140-41. Starke awarded it an exclamation mark, and Engelbach was effusive: 'this masterly performance: the delicate harmony in the contour of the youth, the manly aspect of the Centaur, his attitude, the fanciful and imperceptible junction of the horse to the man, charm at first sight'; Starke 1800, 11, p. 119; Engelbach 1815, p. 178. See Bayardi 1757-92, 1 (1757), pl. 8; Martyn and Lettice 1773, pl. 8; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, 1 (1824), pl. 7; Barré 1870-72, 11 (1870), pl. 3; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 148-49, cat. no. 177; see also Moussinot 1748, p. 36; Miller 1776, il, p. 277; Northall 1766, p. 262. 65 Marsyas and Olympus; painting of the faun Marsyas teach- ing the young Olympus to play the pipes, iv style, 126 x 112 cm, from the Porticus at Herculaneum (see note 62) (MNN inv. no. 91 51). A pair to the more celebrated Chiron and Achilles (see note 64), it was praised by Bayardi as sharing many of its qualities: Marsyas and Chiron are both 'of a middling age, and of a proper figure', each with an 'excellent' head, and 'the attitudes in both . . . beautiful and studied', while Achilles and Olympus are portrayed in the same admirable taste as each other (Bayardi 1757-92, 1 (1757), pl. 9; English translation from Martyn and Lettice 1773, pl. 9). Bayardi also discusses the alternative title of Pan and Olympus, which derives from Pliny's identification of the source statue as such: Marsyas was the tutor of Olympus, to whom Pan held no connection, the confusion perhaps arising from the similarity between repre- sentations of Marsyas, Silenus and Pan. See also Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, p. 69; Barré 1870-72, 11 (1870), pl. 4; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 1, pp. 148-49, cat. no. 178. 66 Painting of the infant Hercules strangling the serpents sent by Juno to kill him, iv style, 123 x 129 cm, from the Porticus at Herculaneum (see note 62) (MNN inv. no. 9012). The figure of Alcmena thought by Flaxman to have 'considerable character &amp; spirit' is much damaged and rather faint, but somewhat recalls the grieving women in the Niobe group (Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 274-79, cat. no. 66). Though Blondeau emphasized the 'vigour' and 'fierceness' of the child, Cochin thought the child Hercules 'execrably design- ed', and the painting appears to have been made by a far inferior hand to that of the other famous pieces from the Porticus; Blondeau and Stack 1749-50, p. 18; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 69-70; Richardson 2000, pp. 89-90. See Bayardi 1757-92, 1 (1757), pl. 7; Martyn and Lettice 1773, pl. 7; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, IX (1833), pl. 54; Barré 1870-72, il (1870), pl. 9; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 1, pp. 148-49, cat. no. 183. 67 Flaxman's critical analysis of the paintings' style is strongly echoed in several near-contemporary accounts, even in the official Antichità di Ercolano series: 'though the authors of these paintings were not all the most perfect masters of their profession, they had always before their eyes, the most excellent originals' (from the English translation, Martyn and Lettice 1773, pl. 5). Starke also wrote that '. . .judging from the beauty of the composition, and the unskillfulness of the execution, it is probable that many of them are copies done by common House-Painters from the most renowned pictures of antiquity' (see also Flaxman's remark on house- painters on f. 23r, and note 60); Starke 1800, 11, p. 118. Winckelmann thought 'most ancient paintings were sketched rapidly and like the first ideas of a drawing . . . [and, in the case of the flying female figures] this rapidity had become as sure as fate through technical knowledge and facility'; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 262. Cochin, who was in gen- eral more critical than Flaxman, stated that 'the manner in these pictures is generally grand and the pencil easy. Other- wise this performance [ Theseus and the Minotaur] is unfinished, and cannot be considered in any other light than that of a forward sketch . . . The manner of painting is generally by hatchings, and sometimes melted: almost all the pieces are unfinished, and painted pretty much like our decorations of 214</page><page sequence="219">flaxman: ucl journal the theatre. The manner is grand enough and the touches easy, but on the whole denote more boldness than skill'; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 60-62, 72; see also Winckel- mann 1764 (2006), pp. 262-63. It was very generally thought that the compositions were taken from other, better paintings or statue groups; for Lalande, this gave the isolated figures strength, but resulted in unsuccessful grouping of the figures, and a coldness which made them compare unfavourably both to ancient sculpture and modern painting; Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 149-52; see also Eustace 1815, p. 36. Forsyth, however, despite considering the works 'pannels painted by provincial artists', thought the motive for the sparse compositions 'was that love of simplicity which distinguishes all their works from ours, and the result was the first merit of all composi- tion, unity of subject and unity of interest'; Forsyth 18 16, pp. 288-90. Some commentators either compared the draughtsmanship to Raphael's work, or thought that he would have been pleased to learn from such models; Blon- deau and Stack 1749-50, p. 17; Venuti 1750, pp. 96-107; Martyn and Lettice 1773, Appendix p. 215. A modern scholar of the paintings, Lawrence Richardson, gives the first four paintings Flaxman mentions to the 'Telephus painter', 'one of the more gifted and consistently painstaking' of the painters, whose style includes unusual, complex compositions and fairly well drawn children. The 'Admetus painter' of the infant Hercules strangling the serpents, however, renders both anatomy and drapery very badly, and of the latter Richardson writes 'the surface tends to be unusually streaky with long folds and hanging V-folds that do not interlock'; Richardson 2000, pp. 89-90, 171-75. See also notes 62-66 for comments on the individual paintings. 68 Two monochrome paintings on marble, the first showing five women playing astragal with knuckle-bones, from the story of Niobe (made in the beginning of the first century ad, 42 X 89 cm, found at Herculaneum in May 1746; MNN inv. no. 9562); the second, Theseus rescuing Hippodamia from the centaur Eurito (as above, 35 x50 cm; MNN inv. no. 9560). Before the discovery of these rare pieces it had not been known that the ancients practised painting on marble, and they formed the first two plates of the prestigious Antichità di Ercolano series (though in part because painting in one colour 'belongs to the rude beginnings of the Art'); Bayardi 1757-92, 1 (1757), pls. 1-2; Martyn and Lettice 1773, pls. 1-2; see also H. Valladares, in Coates and Seydl 2007, p. 77. Lalande compared the subtle outline paintings to draw- ings, and opinion was largely favourable, Bayardi considering that the painting of Theseus and Eurito demonstrated 'by the life which there is in [Theseus'] gesture a superior warmth of fancy in the artist'; Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 83-84; Bayardi (as above); Martyn and Lettice (as above). Cochin thought both the death of the centaur and a theatrical scene not described by Flaxman, 'of a good antique taste, with regard to the dress and the flowing of the drapery: but they are very incorrect', while Winckelmann wished that the monochromes were by a great master, adding 'the heads are common, and the hands are not drawn well'; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 254; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 89-90. See also Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, v (1829), pl. 4; xv (1856), pl. 48; Barré 1870-72, 11 (1870), pls. 17-18; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 172-73, cat. nos. 356-57. 69 Two paintings of the worship of Isis presumably taken from a temple to that deity in Herculaneum, though this building is unrecorded; iv style, 74 x 52 and 80 X 85 cm (MNN inv. nos. 8924, 8919). Flaxman's appreciation of the emotional expression in the paintings is unusual; Blondeau also thought the 'attitudes very just and natural, finely done, great Solemnity or Horror', but added that, 'When looked at near, seems mere daubing and unfinished'; Blondeau and Stack 1749-50, p. 19. Cochin, along with many others, found the subject matter interesting, but the physical objects 'no more than very rude sketches . . . These two pieces are miser- ably executed; the perspective is false when viewed from above and without diminution, nearly in the same taste with that which we call military perspective'; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 75-77, pls. 11a, 12c.

Small, in Dobbins and Foss 2007, p. 189. 70 A series of paintings of forum life from the middle of the first century ad, mostly around 61 cm high, found in the Villa of Julia Felix in Pompeii (11-4,3) (MNN inv. nos. 9020, 9062, 9065, 9066, 9068, 9069). The 'horsed' boy is being bent over the back of another child to be beaten (MNN inv. no. 9066). The scene at the shoemaker's (MNN inv. no. 9069) is one of several depicting different trades, which Cochin thought historically interesting for their 'figures cloathed in the fashion of those times', and for the utensils used; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, p. 82. There are several views of public walks, the most remarked depicting a colonnade with eques- trian statues (MNN inv. no. 9068). See Bayardi 1757-92, in (1762), pls. 41-44; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 168-71, cat. nos. 330-35; Capelli 1999, p. 75. 71 Two famous series of painted flying female figures, thought to be bacchantes or dancers, iii style, approximately 25 cm high, found in January 1749 and taken from the walls of the so-called Villa of Cicero, Pompeii (MNN inv. nos. 9295, 9297). The small decorative figures, each with swirling drapery, are shown stepping lightly in the air against a dark background, some holding jugs, dishes, etc. They were thought exceptionally graceful, tasteful and beautiful, and each was given a separate plate in the Antichità di Ercolano series, where they are reproduced at their actual size; Bayardi 1757-92, i (1757), pls. 17-24; in (1762), pls. 27-30; Martyn and Lettice 1773, pls. 17-24; see also H. Valladares, in Coates and Seydl 2007, p. 78. The drapery in these paintings formed the subject of much debate, and they may have been promi- nent in Flaxman's mind when he later directed artists study- ing ancient clothing to 'the notes on the Herculaneum museum' (i.e. Bayardi); Flaxman 1829, p. 250. His comments here also have much in common with those of other visitors, suggesting careful attention to previous scholarly discussions. Winckelmann, though he thought the lack of narrative meaning limited the paintings, described the small figures as the most beautiful of the ancient paintings, 'fleeting as thought and as beautiful as if drawn by the hand of the Graces'; also, 'one wishes to find more elaborate pieces, as these were done with great facility, as if with a single brush- stroke'; quotation in H. Valladares, in Coates and Seydl 2007, p. 73; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 220-21, 254. Starke informed readers that 'the composition of the Bacchantes, Muses, and other small figures, is said to be so exquisite, that 215</page><page sequence="220">flaxman: ucl journal were an Artist to study for years he could not change one fold in the drapery to any advantage; and the execution is said to be so bad, that more than an hour could not have been employed upon each figure'; Starke 1800, 11, p. 118. Lalande and Lady Anna Miller, though finding the draperies some- times rather confused, both thought the movement of the figures very good, Miller referring to 'dancing girls in very graceful attitudes, and all have beautiful faces'; Lalande 1769, vu, pp. 143-46, Miller 1776, II, p. 278. This particular series is thought to be by the same artist who painted the satyrs dancing on ropes mentioned by Flaxman below, see note 72 for further discussion. See also Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824- 57, vu (1831), pls. 33-40; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 1, pp. 140-41, cat. nos. 126-27. Such small female figures were common to Campanian wall decoration; see the three figures drawn by Flaxman on ff. 43-45 (Cat. nos. 34-36). 72 Paintings of satyrs or fauns dancing and balancing on ropes, iii style, height 24-40 cm, from the so-called Villa of Cicero (MNN inv. nos. 91 19, 9121, 9163). See Bayardi 1757- 92, in (1762), pls. 31, 32; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, vu (1831), pls. 50-52; Barré 1870-72, v (1870), pls. 12-15; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 56, 140-41, cat. nos. 123-25. Lawrence Richardson believes the satyrs to be by the same artist as the Villa of Cicero flying women described above (see note 71), together with a series of centaurs which were highly praised by Winckelmann (see Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 140-41, cat. no. 128 (MNN inv. no. 9133); Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 220-21). Flaxman does not record the centaur groups here, though he copies a reminis- cent group from an ancient relief at Yale Sketchbook, f. 37r. Richardson comments that the satyr paintings have always been thought 'exceptionally evocative and charming', and successfully express variety in movement and spirit with free- dom and an unusual 'fluidity': 'the hands and feet rather roughly blocked out but expressive in their gestures . . . clearly the work of an assured and skilful painter of unusual competence; his figures are not drawn from a stock repertory and do not appear elsewhere, and his command of his medium and such technical matters as foreshortening is impressive'; Richardson 2000, pp. 83-85. Starke gives an exclamation mark to the 'small pictures of Rope-dancers, Bacchantes, &amp;c.', and Cochin thought the very small figures 'certainly the best' of the Herculanean wall-paintings, 'touched with great spirit and taste, and sometimes extremely well coloured . . . they are altogether in the taste of the antique bas reliefs, and the colouring is exceedingly good'; Starke 1800, 11, p. 119; Bellicard (and Cochin) 1756, pp. 107-08. Flaxman later referred in his lecture on Science to the accu- racy of 'the numerous figures springing, jumping, dancing, and falling, in the Herculaneum paintings', strongly recalling this passage (Flaxman 1829, pp. 125-26). A badly damaged painting thought to represent Marsyas and Olympus , largely neglected in the MNN literature; 33 X 37 cm, found in Herculaneum in February 1761 (MNN inv. no. 9 1 41). From what is visible, the painting seems very much in the line of the Marsyas and Olympus and the Chiron and Achilles from the Herculaneum Porticus, though smaller (see notes 64, 65). Barré points out that the figure of the faun is painted not as an animalistic satyr but appears 'entirely human', in the tradition of the sculptor Heliodore; Barré 1870-72, in (1870), pl. 135. See Bayardi 1757-92, iv (1765), pl. 29; Helbig 1868, p. 63, cat. no. 229; Ruesch 191 1, 1, p. 332, cat. no. 1395; Richardson 2000, pp. 34-6. Bronze bust now thought to represent Dionysus, previ- ously also called Plato and Dionysoplaton (an idealization of the figure of Plato). A copy, c. 50 bc, of a late Hellenistic Greek original, height 50 cm, found in April 1759 at the Villa dei Papiri, Herculaneum (see note 40) (MNN inv. no. 5618). Winckelmann wrote that it 'can be viewed as a masterpiece of art, and no conception of it can be conveyed to someone who has not studied it attentively'; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 249. Lady Anna Miller was struck by the beauty and skill of the craftsmanship: 'the immortal Plato is one of the most striking [of the busts] : the ingenuity of the sculptor, in the various curls and natural wreathings of his hair and beard, is wonderful' (Miller 1776, 11, p. 257), while a guidebook claims 'this magnificent sculpture is reputed the finest bronze extant . . . every detail has been most elaborately worked out' (Monaco 1906, p. 50). See Bayardi 1757-92, v (1767), pls. 27-28; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, 1 (1824), pl. 46; Barré 1870-72, vu (1870), pl. 9; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, p. 64; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 136-37, cat. no. 202. 75 Probably the bronze bust of Seleucus I Nicator, a Roman copy around 50 bc of a Lysippean Greek work, height 56 cm, found in the atrium of the Villa dei Papiri (see note 40) (MNN inv. no. 5590). It is identified in Bayardi 1757-92, v (1767), pls. 65-66, as Ptolomy VI Philometor. See also Barré 1870-72, vu (1870), pl. 19; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 130-31, cat. no. 176. 76 Flaxman's 'Berenice' is a bronze bust with soldered copper locks of hair, of an androgynous and Egyptian charac- ter, now thought to be the flautist Thespis of the court of Ptolomy I Soter; it has been identified as many different figures, most frequently in Flaxman's time as Ptolomy Apion or Berenice I. Roman replica of a late Hellenistic original, height 40.5 cm, found in November 1759 (MNN inv. no. 5598). See Bayardi 1757-92, v (1767), pls. 59-60; Giustiniani and Licteriis 1822, p. 45; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, xii (1839), pl. 11; Barré 1870-72, vu (1870), pl. 18; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 136-37, cat. no. 201. Winckel- mann, discussing the use of soldering in ancient sculpture, describes this bust in very similar terms to Flaxman and called it the 'rarest piece of this sort', though he was more impressed by another bust from the Portici collection, a kouros with shorter soldered curls which he thought 'one of the oldest heads in all antiquity'; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 249; see Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 128-29, cat. no. 160 (MNN inv. no. 5608). A later guide to the MNN, after res- toration work on the soldered locks, comments, 'they are in fact, without the ancient patina, badly jointed and of copper'; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, pp. 64-66. In one of his lec- tures, Flaxman spoke of eighth-century bc statues in which 'elaborate finishing . . . [was] carried to excess: undulating locks, and spiral knots of hair like shells . . . wrought with the most elaborate care and exactness'; it is hard to tell if such a pejorative tone is intended here; Flaxman 1829, pp. 75-76. The bust most frequently described as Berenice has a plait wound around the head and scraped back hair, and is a Roman copy of a Greek original from the late fourth century 216</page><page sequence="221">flaxman: ucl journal bc (MNN inv. no. 5592); see Bayardi 1757-92, v (1767), pls. 63-64; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, vu (1831), pl. 12; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 128-29, cat- no- ï6i. It has been thought that its 'lovely head seems not to be a por- trait so much as an ideal figure of Praxitelian type' (Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, p. 63), and is currently believed to be a Sappho. By the 'delicate head' of 'Ptolomy the younger', Flaxman probably means either an Augustan copy of a fourth- century bc bust of Herakles, thought in Flaxman's time to be Ptolomy II Philadelphos, son of Ptolomy I Soter and Berenice I (MNN inv. no. 5594); or, alternatively, a bust of the Hellenistic dynasty often given as Ptolomy II Philadelphos, a Roman copy of a Greek original of the third century bc (MNN inv. no. 5600). All the busts described were found in the atrium or grand peristyle of the Villa dei Papiri, Herculaneum (see note 40). See Bayardi 1757-92, v (1767), pls. 61-62, 67-68; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 128- 31, cat. nos. 163, 174. 77 One of the palaces of the King of Naples, built in 1738 by Charles III of Spain. At the time of Flaxman's visit it housed part of the Bourbon and Farnese collections, which have since been largely transferred to the current MNN building. 78 The Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte holds a strong collection of paintings, particularly of the Neapolitan school and the eighteenth century. For contemporary visitors' lists of the paintings, see Cochin 1758, pp. 129-38; Northall 1766, pp. 221-24; Lalande 1769, vi, pp. 167-79; Miller 1776, il, pp. 356-62; Martyn 1787, pp. 257-58; Starke 1800, 11, p. 76. Titian's Danae was often particularly praised. See also Giustiniani and Licteriis 1822, pp. 161-83. 79 The Tazza Farnese, a sardonyx cameo carved on both sides, one of the largest in existence at 20 cm in diameter, made c. 150 bc and acquired by Lorenzo de' Medici in September 1741 (MNN inv. no. 27611). The scene on the inside of the cup has not been definitively identified, but is often interpreted as an allegory of floods bringing fertility to Egypt; see Northall 1766, p. 224; Monaco 1906, p. 96; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 222-23, cat- no. 1. The cup is celebrated for its size and the technical skill needed to achieve the high relief through several layers of different colours. Lalande thought it the most admirable object at Capodimonte, but more for the difficulty of the work than the superiority of the result. An MNN guide commented further that, 'the graver employ'd in this sculpture, could not arrive at giving an idea of perfection, having been obliged to follow the stone's colours in carving it', though found the Medusa to be 'a masterpiece of sculpture'; Lalande 1769, vi, pp. 179-80; Giustiniani and Licteriis 1822, pp. 59-61. Cochin, conversely, thought the head of Medusa in very bad taste; Cochin 1758, p. 139. See Starke 1800, 11, pp. 75-76; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, xii (1839), pl. 47; Pesce 1932, pp. 19-20. 80 Marble bas-relief of Paris about to abduct Helen, with figures of Aphrodite, Peithó, the goddess of persuasion, and a long-winged Eros. A neo-attic work of the first century bc, after an original of around 430 bc, 67 x 66 cm, from the Carafa di Noja collection (MNN inv. no. 6682). Starke awarded this piece an exclamation mark, evidently finding it more remarkable than the Orpheus and Eurydice mentioned next by Flaxman (see note 81); Starke 1820, p. 414. See Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, 111 (1827), pl. 40; Monaco 1906, pp. 18-19; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, p. 32; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, 11, pp. 148-49, cat. no. 261. 81 Marble bas-relief of Orpheus taking leave of Eurydice, Augustan replica of an original by Alkamenes, a pupil of Phidias, of the fifth century bc, 118x100 cm, from the Carafa di Noja collection (MNN inv. no. 6727). Flaxman draws the Villa Albani version of the relief at V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 4ir. The Naples version, the only one with original inscriptions, is part of a series of three or more pieces probably from a monument to a victory; see Ruesch 191 1, i, pp. 45-48; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, pp. 18-21. Starke noted that it was 'supposed to be very old Greek sculpture', and it is a significant example of the copying of Greek art in Italy; Starke 1820, p. 414; Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 105. See also Museo Nazionale Napoli 1824-57, x (1834), pl. 62; Franciscis 1968, p. 16; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, il, pp. 148-49, cat. no. 260. 82 Wall paintings from the so-called Tomb of the Warrior at Nola (until recently thought to be Paestum), Hellenistic, fourth century bc, height 11 2-1 5 cm, from the Carafa di Noja collection (MNN inv. nos. 9351, 9362-64). Sir William Hamilton was present at their excavation in 1778, and wrote in a letter to the Society of Antiquaries that, 'the style of these paintings corresponds so precisely with that of the figures on the vases, commonly called Etruscan, that it cannot be doubted that they were executed by the same people as fabricated those vases', i.e. Greek artists; see I. Jenkins in Magna Grecia 1996, pp. 249-54. See also Museo Nazionale Napoli 1930, p. 86, which calls the paintings 'excellent'; Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, I, pp. 124-25, cat. nos. 6-8. For a discussion of the reception of Indian art in Britain see Mitter (1977), including comments on Flaxman's appre- ciation of Indian art and its naturalism at pp. 133, 171-72, 311 (n. 220). By the mid-eighteenth century, progressivist ideas held that Indian art had stagnated at its ancient level instead of developing along western lines, although its antiquity was considered excellent and some thought India could have been the birthplace of civilisation and the arts; Mitter 1977, pp. 172-202, 105-15. Compare Flaxman's comments above with the following: James Mill in The History of British India (1817), on paintings: 'The Hindus copy with great exactness, even from nature. By consequence they draw portraits . . . with a minute likeness; but peculiarly devoid of grace and expression . . . They are entirely without a knowledge of perspective, and by consequence of all those finer and nobler parts of the art of painting'; Sonnerat, A voyage to the East Indies . . . (1788): 'Painting is, and ever will be, in its infancy with the Indians . . . They do not understand the chiaro obscuro, the objects in the pictures have no relief, and they are ignorant of perspective'; quoted in Mitter 1977, pp. 177, 116. 83 This could be MNN inv. no. 100 17 (from Formia, 75 x71.5 cm) or MNN inv. no. 10018 (from Chieta, 42.5 x 42.5 cm), ii style, both taken from the same Hellenistic painting. Dunbabin, using Theseus and the Minotaur as an example, points out that the discovery of such similar mosaics suggests the existence of local Hellenistic mosaic workshops; Dunbabin 1999, p. 39. See Museo Nazionale Napoli 1989, i, pp. 118-19, cat- nos. 29-30. 217</page><page sequence="222">flaxman: ucl journal 84 Ancient vases of Greek origin were commonly called 'Etruscan' in the eighteenth century; for an early catalogue of the collection at Capodimonte, see Giustiniani and Licteriis, 1822, pp. 83-155; see also Monaco 1906, pp. 118-27; Ruesch 191 1, i, pp. 461-87; Franciscis 1968, pp. 116-17. Flaxman had worked extensively with such vases from 1775 onwards through his commissions for Wedgwood and Bent- ley, notably in his Apotheosis of Homer (designed 1778). He had access to many designs from the first part of Sir William Hamilton's famous collection, which had been sold in 1772 to the British Museum, and from its publication in d'Hancarville's Collection of Etruscan, Greek and Roman Antiq- uities from the Cabinet of the Honourable William Hamilton (com- pleted 1767-76). Irwin (1979, pp. 22-26, 44) notes that this may account for the relatively low incidence of vases in his Italian sketchbooks and journals, though see the probable reference in the Yale Sketchbook, f. 8ov, to a marble vase decorated with bacchic scenes belonging to the 'King of Naples'. Hamilton, the British envoy at Naples 1764-98, continued to collect from the same local sites which supplied the vases held by the MNN, and often entertained tourists • (including Flaxman) by showing them around his collection; Jenkins and Sloan 1996, p. 31; Irwin 1979, p. 51. Gray, writing between accounts of visits to Portici and to Hamilton, was convinced that 'among the relics of antiquity which we saw at Naples, none are more beautiful than the Etruscan vases'; Gray 1794, pp. 415-16. 85 The vase with Jason is a red figure volute krater, Southern Italian (probably Paestan), from Paestum, early Apulianising, c. 330-10 BC, height 71 cm (MNN inv. no. 82126). Jason is shown with a beard and sword, taking down the golden fleece from a tree around which is twined a large snake that Medea, standing to left, distracts with a cake; warriors to either side strike martial poses. This is an unusual subject, and the snake wound around the tree and the disposition of the figures make the scene strikingly reminiscent of Eve and Adam taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge.

The fine collection at Capodimonte, containing many rare and unique objects, was praised by many visitors, Winckelmann pointing out as objects of particular admiration an Athenian gold quinarius, and two silver coins with a head of Proserpina which 'sur- passes all imagination'; Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 204, 304-05; Cochin 1758, p. 139; Lalande 1769, vi, p. 180. The Farnese coins were not separately catalogued before they were combined with the other collections of the MNN and provenance is not always clear, but happily casts of the entire Farnese collection of coins (around 5,000 objects) were made by the Scottish jeweller William Dugood in 1732-33, and are kept at Burton Constable Hall, Yorkshire; I am indebted to David Connell of Burton Constable for this information.

A SKETCHBOOK USED BY JOHN FLAXMAN DURING HIS STAY IN ITALY (Victoria &amp; Albert Museum) Catalogued by Eckart Marchand Editor's Note The sketchbook consists of 85 folios. It measures approximately 26.7X21.2 cm, including the cover. The pages have never been cut down and measure approximately 26 x 20.7 cm. The sheets are made of Italian paper, the watermark consists of the letters F/AF/C arranged in three lines above one another. The book is known by its inventory number (E 442-1937) and its shelf number (91 D7). In this publication it is solely referred to as V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937. Flaxman used six pages at the end of the volume (pp. 164, 166, 168, 170) to draft a lecture Character, Outline, Proportions and Anatomy of the Human Figure of the Greeks. This is written from back to front and Flaxman numbered these pages in that order as 1-4. For the rest, inscriptions are limited to indications of location and authorship, and occasionally the name of an object. There is no original pagination beyond what is mentioned above. The modern pagination may have been introduced when the book entered the Victoria and Albert Museum. The images have been executed in graphite, pen and ink, and wash. They consist of life drawings, preparatory sketches for the Mansfield tomb and studies after ancient, medieval, Renaissance and baroque sculpture in Rome and Florence. The period covered by the sketchbook cannot be precisely determined. A number of drawings relate to the early design stages of the Mansfield mon- ument, the correspondence for which began in c. May 1793. A possible date for the last use of this volume is provided by the studies after Florentine works that are likely to date from Flaxman's visit to that city in summer 1794. Still, we do not know enough about Flaxman's travels to exclude an earlier date for these drawings. The sketchbook was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum on 21 May 1937 from Mr L. Leslie for the sum Editorial Conventions The sequence of the catalogue follows that of the sketchbook. To avoid confusion, no new catalogue numbers have been introduced. Instead, the existing modern page numbers are used. They are consistent and legible even in most of the reproductions. The lecture text at the back of the volume is written from back to front. It has therefore been transcribed separately in a section directly following the catalogue. In this section a page break is indicated as //[f. ir]. Throughout the catalogue and transcription Flaxman's spelling, capitalization and punctuation have been transcribed as seen, with editorial insertions marked by square brackets, e.g. [.]. [sic] indicates an originally misspelled word, repeated word, etc. Triangular brackets have been used to indicate either an illegible passage, or a word that can only be guessed, e.g. &lt;...&gt;. Single or double strikethroughs have been used as they appear in the journal. Inscriptions that postdate Flaxman's own are rare and do not hold any relevant information; they have not been transcribed.

Both arms are raised up into the air, the model is possibly holding on to rings to maintain the position. The right leg is stretched out, the left leg turned outward and resting on a support. //p. 2 [unused] //p. 3 (Fig- 2) after life Two studies after a male model Graphite These are two studies of a seated model, the top drawing shows the figure in profile to the left in a position of repose. The back is slightly bent, elbows are resting on the thighs and the wrists are crossed. The second image (below) shows the figure again seated to the left, but the pose is altogether more active. Here the body is twisted as the model turns away from the beholder and has raised the arms to hold a scroll. Flaxman renders the first figure evenly, focusing mainly on the outline with some subtle internal modelling. In the drawing below, he concentrates on the rendering of the tense musculature of the back and upper extremities, only briefly indicating the position of the legs. //p. 4 [unused] //p. 5 (Fig. 3) after life Four studies after a male model Graphite (images turned 900 clockwise) The full-length figure on the left shows a male model in contrapposto, with the left arm akimbo in profile to the left; the emphasis is on outline, with minimal internal modelling. In the upper centre and left Flaxman made two half-length drapery studies, depicting from behind the fall of a shirt that is tugged into tight trousers and only briefly indicating the position of the head, hip and upper legs. An apparent scribble on the lower right is likely to have had some representational value for Flaxman, too. Here he may have revisited a detail in the fall of the drapery near the elbow and hip. //p. 6 [unused] / /p. 7 (Fig. 4) after life Three studies after a male nude model Graphite (images turned 90o clockwise) The main study on the left-hand side is an academy drawing of a male model preparing to strike to the left. The head is shown in profile to the left, the torso facing the beholder, the right leg moved forward, the weight of the body rests on the left leg. Only parts of the study are worked up, especially the right leg, torso and upper extremities, while the head and left leg are only roughly indicated. Below and to the right of this drawing, one can discern what appears to be an earlier sketch of the same motif on a larger scale. Apparently, Flaxman ran out of space at the bottom of the rotated page and abandoned the drawing. Flaxman later used the page in its original orientation (portrait format) to study a left arm stretched out horizontally to the left. Here, he focused particularly on the modelling of the arm, hardly rendering the back of the shoulder and hand. As in the other drawings on this sheet, Flaxman achieves shading through hatching. 232</page><page sequence="237">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 //p. 8 [unused] //p. 9 (Fig. 5) after life Study of a hand and seated female model Graphite It is impossible to determine whether these two studies depict the same model. On the top of the page Flaxman studies a hand loosely resting on a surface with its fingers slightly splayed out. Below, he sketches of a dressed female model seated in profile to the left, the arms resting on the thighs. //p. 10 [unused] //p. II (Fig- 6) afterlife Two studies after male model Graphite (images turned 900 clockwise) These two drawings of a male model are very different from each other in motif and technique. The standing figure on the left with both arms raised is a heroic motif, showing the male body in action. Flaxman executes it evenly, fixing the outlines with emphatic strokes of graphite and using light hatching for the careful internal modelling of the body. The drawing on the right-hand side depicts the same model seated to the left and wearing a shirt. The execution is more uneven and generally it is more loosely sketched. Here the focus seems to lie on the model's gentle face and the folds of the drapery. //p. 12 [unused] //p. 13 (Fig. 7) after life Two female nudes and three studies of hands and arms Graphite The female nude features rarely among Flaxman's life drawings. The study at the top of the page depicts the model lying on its right-hand side; the ground is indicated through brief hatching near the model's abdomen and elbow. On the left-hand side below, the same model is shown seated with the left elbow raised, possibly resting on a support. Three studies of hands in the lower part of the page are not related. On the centre right-hand side of the page Flaxman studies the motif of a left arm akimbo, rendering only the left hand as it rests on the hip and the lower arm and elbow up to the opening of a short-sleeved garment. Below this, Flaxman studies on the left-hand side a gesture of blessing and on the right-hand side a hand that loosely holds a small, unidentified object. //p. 14 [unused] //p. 15 (Fig. 8) after life Four studies after a seated and draped male model and two studies of hands Graphite The four drawings after the seated model in a heavy cloak represent variations of the same motif. The first three are very similar in terms of point of view and the model's classical pose. They are all frontal studies, the left arm, invisible to the beholder, is drawn across the body; the right arm, wrapped in the cloak, is moved before the chest with the hand emerging from the folds. The knees are drawn apart, the left foot is set forward. Variations can be found in the model's back posture, varying from upright (u. 1.) to slumped (1. 1.), and the arrangement of the drapery. The cloak opens up and reveals the legs up to the knees in the drawing on the upper left and runs across the knees from left to right in the other two drawings (u.r. and 1. 1.). In contrast, 233</page><page sequence="238">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 the fourth sketch (I.e.) shows the model obliquely from the right, the lower right arm emerges fully from the cloak and rests on the right knee. The right leg is moved forward. The two studies of a raised right hand, the index finger slightly lifted, do not relate. The page precedes the first of a series of drawings after wall monuments that have convincingly been related to Flaxman's work on the Mansfield monument (Irwin 1979, pp. 63-66; Coltman 2006). The life drawings on the present page may have played a role in this project. For life studies for the monument, see this sketchbook, pp. 140, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, esp. 150; for studies after monuments in the context of the Mansfield commission, see this sketchbook, pp. 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 and 127; for further preparatory drawings for the tomb, see Wright in Bindman 2003, pp. 45-46, cat. nos. 3a- d. //p. 16 [unused] Rome, Church of St. Peter's (interior) //p. 17 (Fig. 9) as after Rusconi [Carlo Maratti and Pierre Etienne Monnot] Three studies after the tomb of Innocent XI Graphite 1) (u. 1.) side view from right 2) (u. r.) frontal view Inscribed in graphite below the frontal view: Innocent XI by Rusconi St Peters 3) (1. r.) ground plan Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281, pl. 56c; Irwin 1979, pp. 64-65 The monument to Innocent XI, by Carlo Maratti and Pierre Etienne Monnot (and not by Camillo Rusconi, as claimed by Flaxman) is positioned in the left aisle of New St. Peter's on the right-hand side in a niche into the third monumental pier (1701; Virgilio 2000, pp. 213-22). The correct attribution was known in the eighteenth century, see, e.g., Lalande 1769, in, p. 114. The frontal view (2) is complemented by a side view (1) that records the appearance of the monument when approached through the aisle from the liturgical west. The relationship of the figures of the Pope and Religion is particularly strong from this point of view, while Justice appears as if guarding the Pope. The groundplan (3) records the shape of the niche and the projection of the monument into the space before the niche. It is the lateral view that indicates clearly that this set of studies is not made in the spirit of a Grand Tourist, but by a sculptor with a specific task in mind. Cf. the views of the monuments in the Florentine Medici Chapel (Yale Sketchbook, ff. 23r-26r). Irwin 1976, p. 64, convincingly suggested that Flaxman made this and other drawings after tomb monuments in St. Peter's in the context of his work on the Mansfield monument for Westminster Abbey that occupied him since May 1793. For studies after other monuments in the context of the Mansfield commission, see this sketchbook, pp. 19, 21, 23, 25 and 127; for studies after life for the monument, pp. 15, 140, 150 (for the Mansfield Monument), 152, 154, 156, 160; for further preparatory drawings for the tomb, see Wright in Bindman 2003, pp. 45-46, cat. nos. 3a- d. //p. 18 [unused] //p. 19 (Fig. 10) after Gian Lorenzo Bernini Two studies of the Tomb of Alexander VII 1) frontal view 2) groundplan of the left half of the monument Graphite Inscribed in graphite on pedestal: ALEXANDER VII Inscribed in graphite, c.r.: Pedestal Verde &lt;antico&gt; / Curtains Jasper / Bernini, Sculptor Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281; Bindman 1979, p. 82, cat. no. 86; Irwin 1979, pp. 64-65 234</page><page sequence="239">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 Bernini's tomb of Alexander VII is positioned in what is liturgically speaking the east end of St. Peter's, to the left of the presbytery (1672-78; Virgilio 2000, pp. 35-44; Pope-Hennessy IHFJ3S 1970, pp. 116, 431, pl. 147; Avery 1997, fig. 179). Bernini was anathema to Winckelmann and all neo-classical artists (for example, Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 240, 319, 193), an attitude that Flaxman shared (for example, Flaxman 1829, p. 321). It is therefore surprising to find Flaxman engaging closely with the baroque sculptor's work as he approaches the task of his first major funerary monument. This particular function of the frontal drawing (1) is reflected in the severe simplification of the architecture that appears reduced to a neo-classical setting. Thus Flaxman is not interested in the work for its own sake, but as a particular approach to a specific task. He does, though, record the polychromy of the marbles so crucial to the monument's appearance. The faint sketch below on the left (2) is characteristically economical. It represents just one half of the symmetrical groundplan. For studies after other monuments in the context of the Mansfield commission, see this sketchbook, pp. 17, 21, 23, 25 and 127; for studies after life for the monument, pp. 15, 140, 150 (for the Mansfield Monument), 152, 154, 156, 160; for further preparatory drawings for the tomb, Wright in Bindman 2003, pp. 45-46, cat. nos. 3a-d. //p. 20 [unused] //p. 21 (Fig. II) after Michelangelo Buonarroti Pietà Graphite Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281; Rosenberg 2000, p. 222, cat. no. NZ 181 By the time of Flaxman's visit, Michelangelo's Pietà for St. Peter's had been transferred into New St. Peter's. In 1749 it had been installed by Pope Benedict XIV in the first chapel on the right of the entrance, high above the altar with the right side raised by 9 cm (1497-1500; marble, 174 cm; Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 8-9, 303-05, pl. 6). It had originally been commissioned for the funerary chapel of Jean de Bilhères- Lagraulas in the church of S. Petronilla near Old St. Peter, but in the new setting this funerary context no longer existed. Therefore, Flaxman may have made the study more out of a general interest than with the specific problems of his own commission in mind. As Hugh Brigstocke notes (entry to Ottley collection, Cat. no. 32), Flaxman's drawing seems to be drawn from a high viewpoint. Flaxman may have achieved this by drawing it from far away in an attempt to produce an image as if the sculpture was seen at eye level. Cf. Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 32.

Based on a design by Bernini, the work was executed in 1635 by Andrea Bolgi, who carved the statue, and Stefano Speranza who was in charge of the 235</page><page sequence="240">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 relief (Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 2, 115-16, 425, fig. 164; Avery 1997, p. 78, fig. 85). It is positioned in the right aisle, that is, in the liturgical south, on the left-hand side in a niche that is cut into the second pier. 2) (r.) Tomb of Alexander VIII Inscribed in graphite on the sarcophagus: ALEXANDER VIII Positioned to the left of the choir in the liturgical east end of St. Peter's, the tomb of Alexander VIII is based on a design by Carlo Arrigo Comte di San Martino (1725; Virgilio 2000, pp. 45-54). Flaxman's frontal view records the general composition of the monument. For studies after other monuments in the context of the Mansfield commission, see this sketchbook, pp. 17, 19, 21, 25 and 127; for studies after life for the monument, pp. 15, 140, 150 (for the Mansfield Monument), 152, 154, 156, 160; for further preparatory drawings for the tomb, see Wright in Bindman 2003, pp. 45-46, cat. nos. 3a-d. //p. 24 [unused] //p. 25 (Fig. 13) after Antonio Canova Tomb of Clement XIII Graphite with some minute retracings in pen and ink Inscribed in graphite below the image: Canova Inscribed in graphite on the monument: Clement XIII Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281; Bindman 1979, p. 82, cat. no. 86; Irwin 1979, pp. 64-65, figs 79-80 As noted by Whinney, Canova's tomb of Clement XIII provides the terminus post quern for the present set of drawings after monuments in St. Peter's, and puts them neatly into the context of the planning of the Mansfield Monument (1783-92; marble, 820 x 630 x 254 cm; Licht 1983, pp. 60-65, esp. fig. 16; Virgilio 2000, pp. 1 1 1-20). Similar to most of the previous drawings, the summary sketch records the general composition and icono- graphy of the tomb, without much attention to details such as the inscription (it is abbreviated and rearranged, simply to identify the monument) or reliefs. The composition of the monument with two allegorical figures and the figure of the Pope at the apex of the triangle is closely followed in the Mansfield monument.

Already in ancient Rome masks of this type functioned as architectural decorations. The faint drawing on the right-hand side consists solely of a brief sketch of the figure's nose. See Yale Sketchbook, ff. 59r and 68r; UCL Journal, f. I5r and Cat. no. 24 (for other studies after masks) . 236</page><page sequence="241">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 //p. 28 [unused] Life drawings //p. 29 (Fig- 15) after life Two male nudes Graphite The main study on this page is a frontal view of the male figure in a relaxed contrapposto stance with the arms drawn behind the back. By the standards of Flaxman's studies, this drawing is carefully finished, with subtle internal modelling and soft outlines. A view of the same model in the same pose can be found on p. 31. The small study below differs in size, technique and motif as here the model is only briefly sketched in a much more animated contrapposto pose with both arms raised and the head tilted back- and sidewards. //p. 30 [unused] //p. 31 (Fig- 16) after life Two male nudes Graphite The large drawing on this page is a view from the right-hand side of the same model in the same pose as depicted in the main drawing on p. 29. There is very little internal modelling and a number of pentimenti are apparent, especially where Flaxman established the outline of the legs. As on p. 29, the smaller sketch is of a model in a more animated pose; in this case the figure appears to prepare to throw a heavy weight. //p. 32 [unused] //p. 33 (Fig- r7) after life Three male nudes and two studies of arms Graphite, pen and ink Inscribed in ink, u. r.: lifting a weight The figures on this page can be divided into two groups. The first, consisting of two studies of arms and a figure on the lower left, relate to Flaxman's interests in anatomy, proportion and movement, all of which were addressed in his later lecture 'On Science' and parts of which are also mentioned in his draft of a lecture at the end of the present sketchbook (see the transcriptions at the end of the catalogue) . The fully completed figure on the lower left has the right hand raised, ready to stab an opponent, producing a beautiful, dynamic diagonal from the left foot up to the right hand far above the head. The right leg carries the weight of the figure. The left arm is drawn across the chest to protect the body against an attack. Similar figures appear in Flaxman 1829, p. 127 ('Striking'), pl. 30, to illustrate concepts of motion, gravity and balance. The two studies of a right arm (u.l. and u. r.) are concerned with the bones and muscles of the arm when lifting a weight. The inscription relates to the categories of motion that Flaxman 1829, p. 127, lays out in his lecture 'On Science' ('Striking', 'Bearing a weight'). Less active poses can be found in the remaining two drawings after the living model. A rather introverted pose is that of the model in the upper centre. The model is seated, the right hand resting on the left shoulder, the left arm raised to the crown of the tilted head. In this drawing Flaxman focuses on the torso and upper extremities solely. Finally, the figure in the centre right is a mirror-reversed version of the figure in the lower left, but here the right arm is raised to the head and the head is tilted, giving the model a contemplative air of repose rather than action. Again, Flaxman only renders parts of the legs and the left arm. Cf. this sketchbook, p. 162; Flaxman 1829, pp. 126-29, pl. 30. 237</page><page sequence="242">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 //p. 34 [unused] //p- 35 (Fig- ï8) after life Three studies of seated male model Graphite All three drawings depict the same model in the same complex pose. The man is seated. The left leg is stretched out down to the ground, the right leg is pulled up resting like the right hand on the seat. The left hand holds on to a staff and supports the model's tilted head. The central drawing, larger and more highly worked up than the others, shows this pose from its most complex frontal view, recalling studies and poses from the Carracci academy. The faint drawing of a lower left arm above the model's left shoulder relate to an abandoned earlier drawing. The other two sketches depict the same pose from the right (u. r.) and left (1. 1.). They are supplementary in that they are smaller and less finished. //p. 36 [unused] //p- 37 (Fig. 19) after life Male nude Graphite Lit.: Irwin 1979, p. 47, fig. 56 This academy shows the mail nude in a contrapposto pose from behind, the weight is resting on the left leg, the right arm akimbo. //p. 38 [unused] //p. 39 (Fig. 20) after life Four male nudes Graphite Three different poses of a male model are sketched on this page, one lying and two standing; in addition, Flaxman briefly repeats the right elbow of the bottom left-hand figure. While the top figure could be used to represent a dead person, the two below show the heroic nude in action. //p. 40 [unused] / /p. 41 (Fig. 21) after life Male seated nude and two studies of arms and shoulders Graphite The main study in this page is carefully executed. It is a frontal view of a male nude seated with both hands resting on the thighs. The challenge of this unassuming pose lies mainly in the convincing foreshortening of the thighs and lower arms. The two studies above of arms and shoulders in profile to the left may derive from the same drawing session. They are largely concerned with the outline of the arm and its articulation with the shoulder. //p. 42 [unused] //p. 43 (Fig. 22) afterlife Male nude Graphite 238</page><page sequence="243">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 The heroic pose in this drawing allows Flaxman to study the modelling of the back of the torso and the tense musculature of arms and legs. A number of pentimenti can be discerned, for example, in the positioning of the near leg and the outline of the far upper arm. //p. 44 [unused] //p. 45 (Fig. 23) after life Three studies after male nude Graphite The first drawing on this page was the view on the top right of a male nude seen from behind, the legs wide apart and both arms raised to shoulder height. Flaxman then drew below a partial study of the same pose in which he studies the musculature of the back and the articulation of the shoulder. Finally, he drew on the top left-hand side a frontal view of the model in a similar pose, partially covering the first sketch. //p. 46 [unused] //p. 47 (Fig. 24) after life Male nude Graphite In this and the following drawing (p. 49) Flaxman puts particular emphasis on the rendering of the heavier, less athletic body of the older model with its comparatively harsh and expressive facial features. Both studies focus entirely on the upper body and omit the legs. Here the model is shown seated in profile to the left, the left arm is raised to shoulder level and stretched out forward. There are a number of pentimenti , indicating Flaxman's initial problem in positioning the left hand at the right distance from the body. //p. 48 [unused] //p. 49 (Fig. 25) after life Male nude Graphite The older model is shown from the front, grasping a staff with the left hand, the right is resting on the thigh; cf. p. 47 for a general comment on this and the previous drawing after the same model. //p. 50 [unused] //p. 51 (Fig. 26) after life Four studies after male nude Graphite All four sketches depict the male nude lying down slightly below eye level. The two top drawings show the model from the side lying on his back, the arms raised above the head. The main focus of these studies is the rendering of the stretched-out body and flattened abdomen. The two drawings below show the model lying on his front. They differ from each other in motif, viewpoint and degree of finish. The third drawing from the top shows the model burying his head in his arms from an oblique viewpoint. The relaxed back and arms are all described with careful internal modelling. In contrast, the fourth, hardly legible drawing on the lower left, renders the model only through outlines. Here the figure attempts to raise the upper body by pressing the arms against the ground. All four poses would be useful for images of resting, injured or deceased figures. 239</page><page sequence="244">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 //p. 52 [unused] //p. 53 (Fig. 27) after life Three studies after male nude Graphite The three studies on this page render the seated model in three similar poses from three complementary viewpoints. Flaxman executes them in increasingly reduced scale and degree of finish. The drawing at the top dominates the page through its size and attracts the gaze through the strong tonal contrasts and relatively high finish of the lower arm. Here, the model is seen seated in profile. The second drawing, on the bottom left, shows the seated figure frontally, the legs are crossed, the left hand rests on the left thigh, the right hand is raised before the body. Flaxman entirely omits the head in this drawing. Finally, the third sketch, barely legible, gives an oblique view of the model from the right with the right arm stretched out downward. //p. 54 [unused] //p. 55 (Fig. 28) after life Three studies after male nude Graphite Again, Flaxman draws three studies of related poses of the male nude model. The top left sketch shows the male figure in profile with the right leg raised, bending down to the foot as if tying the laces of a shoe. The smaller drawing on the right is of a figure in profile to the left, who is leaning forward, the bent left knee resting on a step as he touches the ground with the outstretched left arm. Finally, the third drawing below is a frontal study of a right hand, arm and shoulder pressing downward as they support the weight of the upper body. //p. 56 [unused] //p. 57 (Fig. 29) after life Male Nude Graphite As in the previous pages, Flaxman may have intended to complete a number of related drawings on this page, without actually achieving more than the initial one at the top. Here the model is lying on his back, arms and gaze directed upward. An unusual number of pentimenti reveals the sculptor's struggle to render the exact position of the model's legs. Location of source unknown //p. 58 [unused] //p- 59 (Fig- 3°) after an Etruscan gem Tydeus / An athlete cleaning his legs with a strigil Graphite and pen and ink Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 276, pl. 54, fig. a; Bindman 1979, p. 82, cat. no. 86 The linear style of the drawing and the archaic rendering of the human body reflect the technique and style of the underlying model. The Tydeus carneol was acquired in 1754 by Baron Philipp von Stosch (1691-1757), at this time resident in Florence. After his death, the collection was bought by Frederick the Great of Prussia and has been ever since in Berlin (Zazof and Zazof 1983, p. 63, pl. 21, 1, 2; Furtwängler 1900, 11, p. 80, pl. 16, no. 59; Zwierlein-Diehl 2007, pp. 387-88, pl. 76, fig. 317; Richter 1968-71, 1 (1968), p. 183, no. 724). Winckelmann (1767 (1821), 11, pp. 141, no. 106) reproduces the stone and mentions it as the best of all Etruscan gem cutting; he identifies the hero as Tydeus, the father of Diomedes and one of the seven heroes who fought against Thebes. 240</page><page sequence="245">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 The stone from the Stosch collection was already out of the country when Flaxman came to Italy. His drawing may be based on a classical or modern copy of the stone. It is unlikely that Flaxman followed an engraving, as his drawing is stylistically particularly close to ancient stones. See this sketchbook, pp. 67, 69, 71 and UCL Journal, Cat. no. 37, for other drawings after gems. //p. 60 [unused] Life drawings //p. 61 (Fig. 31) after life Two studies of legs Graphite In the centre of this page Flaxman studies the hip and leg of a model in a classical contrapposto pose. He focuses on the weight-bearing right leg and only outlines the left leg with faint strokes. Further to the right he draws an independent study of a leg with the knee bent. It is slightly larger in scale. The drawings on this page and on pp. 63 and 65 may derive from the same drawing session. See this sketchbook, pp. 63, 65 and 83 for other studies of legs. //p. 62 [unused] //p. 63 (Fig- 32) after life Two studies of legs Graphite The studies on this page are likely to derive from the same life-drawing session as those on pp. 61 and 65. The drawing on the upper half of the page renders a similar, if not the same left leg in the same seated pose as in the right-hand drawing on p. 61; in the study below the pose of the right leg is similar to that of the left leg (depicted frontally) at the top of p. 65. See this sketchbook, pp. 61, 65 and 83 for other studies of legs. //p. 64 [unused] //p. 65 (Fig. 33) after life Two studies of a leg and an arm Graphite The study of a left leg on the top of this page probably derives from the same life-drawing session as those on pp. 61 and 63. The study of a stretched-out left arm with a clenched fist below may or may not date from the same time. See this sketchbook, pp. 61, 63 and 83 for other studies of legs. //p. 66 [unused] Location of source unknown //p. 67 (Fig. 34) after unidentified Greco-Roman gem Victory steering a quadriga Graphite and pen and ink Lit.: Irwin 1979, p. 54, fig. 68 Pliny (35, 108) describes a large painting on the Roman Capitol depicting Victory steering a quadriga. A number of Augustan gems of the same subject matter are believed to reflect this composition; Zwierlein-Diehl (1973-91, 1 (1973), no. 214, pp. 89-90) lists eleven ancient copies. 241</page><page sequence="246">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 Flaxman's design is stylistically very close to the originals which suggests that he followed an gem or a cast, rather than a print. This impression is confirmed by the pentimenti in the drawing. Yet, it is difficult to determine whether he followed one of the copies now known, or whether his drawing is based on a lost work. The closest comparison is a cameo in St. Petersburg ( c . 50-40 bc, Furtwängler 1900, 11, p. 260, pl. LVII, no. 6; Zwierlein-Diehl 2007, p. 409, pl. 96, fig. 437). Here the usual palm branch in Victory's left hand is broken off, which would account for its total absence in Flaxman's drawing. But there are also differences: in the cameo the rear legs of the front horses are visible, while in Flaxman's image they are not, and in the stone Victory's left wing obstructs the head of the second horse from the right. Flaxman may have used this drawing as a starting point for Juno and Minerva going to assist the Greeks (Flaxman, Iliad, 1870, pl. 16) and The Hours taking thee horses from Juno's car (Flaxman, Iliad , 1870, pl. 17). See this sketchbook, pp. 59, 69 and 71 for other drawings after gems. //p. 68 [unused] //p. 69 (Fig. 35) after Roman gem Mercury Psychopompos Graphite and pen and ink This image of Mercury as carrier of the souls derives from a famous fifth-century Greek gem that had been part of the Florentine Stosch collection and is now in Berlin, Staatliche Museen (Zwierlein-Diehl 2007, pp. 388-89, pl. 77, fig. 323; Richter 1968-71, 1 (1968), p. 194, cat. no. 784). Winckelmann (1759 (1825), pp. 376-77, 2nd class, 8th section, cat. no. 413, and idem. 1767 (1821), p. 45, no. 39) interprets the small figure as Proserpina carried back by Mercury to Ceres but suggests a more general reference to Mercury's function as Psychopompos. Flaxman's drawing is closer in style and subject matter to the original than the engraving in Winckelmann 1767 (1821), no. 39, since the carried figure is male and looks towards the right. See this sketchbook, pp. 59, 67 and 71 for other drawings after gems. //p. 70 [unused] //p. 71 (Fig. 36) after ancient gem Theseus and Phaia (?) Graphite For unknown reasons Flaxman abandoned this drawing after an ancient gem. Only the basic outlines of the composition are drawn with very regular, yet almost invisible graphite strokes. A male figure, kneeling obliquely to the front and left, the torso shown frontally and the head turned in profile to right, supports a female figure. She is lying across his left arm, her head flung back, her hair hanging down. He has raised his arm over his head as he looks down at her. In the foreground lies a club. Thin curved lines either side of the hero indicate the flying drapery of his cloak. The stone is discussed in Winckelmann 1759 (1825), pp. 540-41, 3rd class, ist section, no. 86, and Winckelmann 1767 (1821), pp. 131-32, no. 97). The German antiquarian identifies the subject matter as Theseus and Phaia and states that the stone, formerly in the Farnese collection, had been stolen. Furtwängler 1900, 11, pp. 179, pl. XXXVII, no. 34, illustrates an ancient gem with the same image, now in Berlin (inv. no. 4286). He questions Winckelmann's identification of the subject matter. It is likely that Flaxman had an ancient gem or a cast before him when he made his drawing, as it is considerably closer in style to the ancient stone in Berlin than the engraving published by Winckelmann.

In contrast, he indicates the fall of the drapery only through bold lines. The model holds a staff in the right hand. The second study on this page depicts a variation in the pose of the right hand. Here it is placed on the armrest. //p. 74 [unused] //p. 75 (Fig. 38) after life Two studies of a hand and nude male Graphite The two studies on this page are apparently unrelated. The top drawing reveals again Flaxman's concern for the depiction of the human body in this classical motif of a hand emerging from a tunic and holding its hem. The pose of the male model in the drawing below, lying on his front and propping his chest up with his arms, is not dissimilar to that of the fourth sketch on p. 51. In this design Flaxman concentrates on the model's musculature and the dramatic foreshortening of the torso. //p. 76 [unused] //p. 77 (Fig- 39) after life Two male nudes Graphite The pose of the lying figure on the top recalls that of an ancient river-god, but could also be used for a fallen warrior. Below, Flaxman draws from below and behind the standing model with the arms stretched out. The emphasis in this drawing lies on the rendering of the heroic male in action. //p. 78 [unused] //p. 79 (Fig. 40) after life Sketch of seated nude and three studies of arms Graphite The three studies of arms on this page show variations on a militant pose, the arm stretched out, fist clenched as if holding a dagger. A related fourth drawing can be found on p. 81. An outline sketch on the top left of the present page is unrelated. Here the seated model is depicted from behind with the left arm raised; the pose echoes that of some of Michelangelo's ignudi in the Sistine Chapel. //p. 80 [unused] Florence, Loggia dei Lanzi and Life drawing //p. 81 (Fig. 41) after life and after Giambologna A Study of an arm and two studies after The Rape of the Sabine Woman Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281; Irwin 1979, p. 58&gt; fig- 72 1) (u. r.)

The Rape of the Sabine Woman seen obliquely from behind and the right Graphite, pen and ink Lit.: Irwin 1979, p. 58, fig. 72 Having used this page for the study of an arm, which he completed presumably in Rome, Flaxman would come back to it when in Florence, most likely in summer 1794, to make two small outline sketches after Giambolo- gna's Rape of the Sabine Woman (1581-82; height 410 cm; Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 52-54, 383-84, pl. 85; Avery 1987, pp. 109-14, pl. 104-07). The sculpture was regularly mentioned by Grand Tourists (Aynscough 1778, p. 122; Hobhouse 1796, p. 130). During his first visit to Florence, Flaxman had noted the sculpture in positive terms without making any drawing after it, as small-scale reproductions were easily accessible in England (Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 3r). The present drawings are highly analytical studies that reveal two of Flaxman's specific interests. Firstly, they provide insight into the design of the individual figures, of the female figure in study 2 and of the male in study 3 . Secondly, they illuminate the relationship of the sculpture and the original block of marble; see, for example, the resulting straight lines on the left-hand side of study 2 and on the right-hand side of study 3 . Though small in scale, the two drawings are carefully drawn with a light underdrawing, slowly retraced and fixed in pen and ink. See Fitzwilliam Journal, ff. 3r, 3 V, 5V. //p. 82 [unused] Life drawings / /p. 83 (Fig- 42) after life Two studies of legs Graphite Flaxman first drew the legs of a model standing with legs closely together, the weight notionally resting on the model's left leg. A second, more decisive drawing of a third leg seems to have been made at a later stage over the initial drawing; it derives from a bolder stance, with both legs wide apart. Drawn with stronger tonal contrasts and more evenly executed, this second drawing is similarly concerned with the anatomy of the leg, and particularly the knee. //p. 84 [unused] //p. 85 (Fig. 43) after life Male Nude Graphite The model's pose in this drawing is very similar to that of Michelangelo's Ignudo next to The Separation of the Waters in the Sistine Chapel Ceiling (Chapman 2006, fig. 47). The model is wearing his hair in a sack in order not to obstruct the anatomy of the back. //p. 86 [unused] Rome, Monte Cavallo / Piazza del Quirinale //p. 87 (Fig. 44) as after Phidias The left-hand Horse Tamer Graphite 244</page><page sequence="249">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 This is a view of the back of the left-hand Horse Tamer from behind. As in his other drawings of the group, Flaxman concentrates on the outline with very little internal modelling or detail. See Yale Sketchbook, f. 6or, for a discussion of the Horse Tamers and their reception; this sketchbook, pp. 89, 91, 107, 109, hi, and Yale Sketchbook, f. 6or (for the left-hand Horse Tamer), Yale Sketchbook, f. 6ir (for a drawing of the right-hand Horse Tamer); Flaxman 1829, pp. 93, 278-79. //p. 88 [unused] //p. 89 (Fig. 45) as after Phidias The left-hand Horse Tamer Graphite This study is drawn from exactly the same position as f. 6or in the Yale Sketchbook. The comparison of the two drawings is instructive. Even more than in the earlier sketch Flaxman restricts himself to an outline drawing, only occasionally indicating volume and surface through very light smudging. Volume is rather indicated through changes in tone in the outlines that also bring the design to life, but the tonal range of the present drawing is much more limited and there are fewer pentimenti. See Yale Sketchbook, f. 6or, for a discussion of the Horse Tamers and their reception; this sketchbook, pp. 87, 91, 107, 109, hi, and Yale Sketchbook, f. 6or (for the left-hand Horse Tamer), Yale Sketchbook, f. 6ir (for a drawing of the right-hand Horse Tamer); Flaxman 1829, pp. 93, 278-79. //p. 90 [unused] //p. 91 as after Phidias The left-hand Horse Tamer Graphite Flaxman assumed a position obliquely behind and to the left of the figure for this faint and irreproducible graphite sketch. The head is seen from behind and the torso in profile. Ultimately, Flaxman seems to have found this viewpoint unsatisfactory and abandoned the drawing at an early stage. See Yale Sketchbook, f. 6or, for a discussion of the Horse Tamers and their reception; this sketchbook, pp. 87, 89, 107, 109, hi, and Yale Sketchbook f. 6or (for the left-hand Horse Tamer), Yale Sketchbook, f. 6ir (for a drawing of the right-hand Horse Tamer); Flaxman 1829, pp. 93, 278-79. Location of sources unknown //p. 92 (Fig. 46) after unidentified ancient relief (?) Graphite (image turned 900 anti-clockwise) Male figure kneeling to the right as it succumbs to an attack A male nude, shown frontally with his head turned in profile to the right, has collapsed onto his left knee. The left arm is raised and drawn over his head, holding a cloth that flutters in the wind. The right leg is stretched out backwards, as is the right arm. The pose suggests a relief composition, while the strong chiaroscuro under the figure's right armpit indicates a high level of relief studied from nearby. The careful and soft internal modelling and the rendering of surface qualities suggest that the source was a larger stone relief, rather than a small-scale object. The actual source has not been identified. See this sketchbook, p. 163. Florence, Uffizi //p. 93 (Fig. 47) after Etruscan statuette Alexander and Bucephalus Graphite, pen and ink, grey wash (image turned 900 clockwise) 245</page><page sequence="250">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 During his first visit to Florence, Flaxman mentioned the Etruscan bronzes in the Grand Duke's collections only briefly (Fitzwilliam Journal, fF. 8r, 8v). A few months later, on his visit to Naples, he engaged more extensively with the objects in the Royal Collections there. The present drawing, after an Etruscan bronze statuette, and those that follow in this sketchbook (pp. 109, 113, 115), document a close engagement with these works, if a selective one, as he copies exclusively statuettes from the classical period. The chosen viewpoint for this drawing after the bronze statuette of Alexander and Bucephalus enables Flaxman to depict the male figure frontally and unobstructed by the horse (Hus 1975, p. 118, pl. 50.2). The group was already published by Gori (1737-43, pl. LXXIIII), is kept at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, and a sculpture of the same subject matter at Portici is mentioned in the UCL Journal, f. 20r. An additional drawing to the right-hand side of the group apparently includes two human figures on a smaller scale, but is ultimately illegible. See Flaxman 1829, pp. 99 (on Etruscan sculpture in general), 109 (on ancient bronze statuettes). //p. 94 [unused] Life drawing //p- 95 (Fig- 48) after life Three studies of arms and a knee Graphite The two studies at the top of the page depict a right arm with bent elbow, the hand resting on the end of a staff above shoulder level. Flaxman draws the motif first from the side (u. 1.), focusing almost entirely on the lower arm and hand; in the second drawing (u. r.) he studies it obliquely from behind and renders the articulation of shoulder and upper arm. The study (below) of a seated model's right knee is drawn at eye level. //p. 96 [unused] Rome, Palazzo Altemps //p. 97 (Fig. 49) after ancient sculpture Hercules with the Apples of the Hesperides Graphite Inscribed in graphite, 1. 1.: Altemps The sculpture of Hercules with the Apples of the Hesperides was in the Palazzo Altemps when seen by Flaxman and it remains there (Matz and Duhn 1881-82, 1 (1881), p. 123; Palagia in LIMC iv, 1 (1988), no. Herakles 921, pp. 772-73; iv. 2, no. Herakles 921, p. 507; d'Ossat 2002, pp. 38-39). Flaxman draws the sculpture from the front and the back (p. 99). It is attractive to assume that he studied it in preparation of his own work on the group of Hercules and Hebe , a reconstruction of the Torso Belvedere, that also involved a seated Hercules (Irwin !979» pp- 58-59» fig- 74 )• The present frontal study reveals Flaxman's particular attention to the torso and the anatomy of the legs. //p. 98 [unused] //p. 99 (Fig. 50) after ancient sculpture Hercules with the Apples of the Hesperides Graphite In this study Flaxman focuses on the description of the musculature of the back.

A Head of Selene The goddess Selene is recognizable through her attribute, the moon sickle, but the identification of this head is difficult; on the representations of Selene, see Gury in LIMC vu, 1 (1994), pp. 706-15. //p. 102 [unused] //p. 103 (Fig- 52) after unidentified ancient sculpture Standing Goddess / Minerva Graphite (image turned 900 clockwise) This is a frontal view of a female figure who might represent the goddess Minerva.

Minerva 156 and Minerva 161. Flaxman positioned the figure in the left-hand corner of the page, which suggests that he intended to add one or two complementary views, most likely from the side, as he did in numerous other cases (for example, pp. 134-35 below). //p. 104 [unused] //p. 105 (Fig. 53) after ancient statuette Two studies of a winged figure of Victory Graphite and pen and ink Lit.: Irwin 1979, pp. 54, 224, fig. 68 1) frontal view 2) side view The model for these two drawings is an ancient bronze statuette, now in Kassel (height 67 cm, inv. no. Br 121; Eissenhauer 2004, p. 27; Bieber 1915, pp. 60-62, no. 153). It left Rome 1777 as part of an acquisition of works by Frederick II of Hesse-Kassel, but there is strong evidence that Flaxman knew it through a plaster cast. Irwin (1979, p. 54, fig. 65) recognized that the figure of Aurora in Flaxman's Aurora visiting Cephalus on Mount Ida (1789-90) derived from this statuette and pointed to a plaster cast of the statuette in the Sir John Soane's Museum, previously owned by Flaxman. According to Flaxman's sister in-law and adopted daughter, Maria Denman, this was an 'original Italian plaister Cast of an Antique Victory - brought from Rome by John Flaxman' (quoted after Dorey 2003, p. 32). 247</page><page sequence="252">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 In fact, the statuette seems to have been popular in late eighteenth-century Rome with a number of copies around. A few modern restorations of ancient statues of male figures equiped these with this or similar statuettes of Victory held in their hands (for example: Clarac 1826-53, v (1851), p. 262, no. 2494, pl. 970 (male figure); Clarac 1826-53, v (1851), no. 2461, p. 249, pl. 958 (Statue of Lucius Verus); Clarac 1826-53, v (ï 85 1), no. 2219, p. 137, pl. 861 and Clarac 1826-53, iv (1850), p. 135, no. 1438A, pl. 633 (statue of Mars)). A very similar bronze copy of the sculpture is also held by Antonio Canova's Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker (1806, now in Wellington Museum, Apsley House), but a comparison of the measurements indicates that the two sculptures do not derive from the same mould. Still, it is obvious that both go back to the original in Kassel and/or another, extremely close Roman copy. (I am indebted to Helen Dorey, Deputy Director and Jane Bush, Conservator, of the Sir John Soane's Museum, and to Susan Jenkins, Curator of Sculpture, Wellington Museum, for discussing these works with me and letting me examine them from nearby.) Later on, Flaxman had two opportunities to see the original sculpture. On his journey home, in autumn 1794, he travelled through Kassel, and he may again have seen it in 1802 when, during the Peace of Amiens, he travelled to Paris to admire the works that Napoleon had amassed in the French capital (Irwin 1979, 53). Rome, Monte Cavallo / Piazza del Quirinale //p. 106 [unused] //p. 107 (Fig. 54) as after Phidias The left-hand Horse Tamer Graphite and pen and ink For this study Flaxman positioned himself at maximum distance, c. 30 m away from the large group at the corner of the Palazzo del Quirinale. The distance reduces any effects of distortion and flattens the sculpture, but the chosen angle of vision creates a complex and lively image as head and body appear in contrasting three-quarter views. The drawing is very carefully worked up with fine and evenly applied graphite strokes and there are hardly any pentimenti. Although this is largely an outline drawing, it shows a high degree of internal design, when compared with Flaxman's other drawings of this sculpture. Flaxman uses an unusually fine graphite and parallel hatching to indicate shading.

The sculpture appears strongly foreshortened and towers over the beholder. Flaxman decided not to continue this dramatic image; yet, when reusing the page in Florence, he avoided drawing over it. See Yale Sketchbook, f. 6or, for a discussion of the Horse Tamers and their reception; this sketchbook, pp. 87, 89, 91, 107, hi, and Yale Sketchbook, f. 6or (for the left-hand Horse Tamer); Yale Sketchbook, f. 6ir (for a drawing of the right-hand Horse Tamer); Flaxman 1829, pp. 93, 278-79. 248</page><page sequence="253">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 2) - 8) Etruscan warrior statuettes 2) (u. r.) Head with helmet of an Etruscan statuette now in Florence, Museo Archeologico, inv. no. 82. 3) and 4) (c. r.) The largest study in pen and ink on this page represents the most spectacular classical Etruscan warrior statuette of the collection (5.3 cm.; middle of fifth century bc; Florence, Museo Archeologico Nazionale, inv. no. 586; Richardson 1983, pp. 180-81, fig. 413; Hus 1975, p. 107, pl. 45). Flaxman renders this figure roughly three times the size of the original. It may in fact have been the first drawing that he added to that of the Horse Tamer , before deciding to copy others above and below. The figure is shown in frontal view, a simple outline drawing to the right of its head records the helmet in profile. Helmets, both on their own and worn, feature frequently in Flaxman's compositions after Homer; and while direct copies of any of those copied here are difficult to find, some are very close (for example, Homer invoking the Muse (Flaxman, Iliad, 1870, pl. 1); Diomed casting his sword after Mars (Flaxman, Iliad , 1870, pl. 12)). See also UCL Journal. 5), 6) and 7) (1. 1.) These are three other classical Etruscan warrior figures, all now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale (from left to right study 5: inv. no. 121; Richardson 1983, p. 181, fig. 414-15; study 6: inv. no. 91378, and study 7: inv. no. 338). While according to the inventory the figure in study 6 is nowadays without lower legs, photographic reproductions in the Florentine Gabinetto Fotografico show all of them with legs. If Flaxman omits the arms and parts of the legs of some of these figures then that indicates that he was interested rather in the armour than the poses of the figures. I am indebted to Annegret Höhler, Florence, for her exten- sive help with the identification of the Etruscan statuettes from the collections of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale. 8) (1. r.) The last statuette is that of a rider who may have been separated from his horse. Alternatively, Flaxman may have chosen to omit this as well as the arms and legs of the figure. It has not been identified. //p. 110 [unused] Rome, Monte Cavallo / Piazza del Quirinale //p. hi (Fig. 56) as after Phidias The left-hand Horse Tamer Graphite and pen and ink Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 276, pl. 55, fig. d This is the third drawing of the supposedly Phidian Horse Tamer seen from the left-hand side (see Yale Sketchbook, f. 6or, and the present sketchbook, p. 89). In contrast to the other drawings, this one is taken from a viewpoint c. 8 m further south. The resulting view is more complex, as the figure's face appears in lost profile, the stance is less firm and the gesture of the right arm has lost its visual impact as it is seen from straight on. The drawing is more finished than any of the other studies after the group, the horse is recorded in its outline and the drapery with its play of shade and light is used as a back foil for the sculpture with its subtle internal design.

Two winged figures holding a deceased warrior This group served as the handle of a bronze lid; two winged figures are carrying a deceased warrior into the land of the dead. The object is now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Florence (inv. no. 682; Haynes 249</page><page sequence="254">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 1985, no. 120). It was published by Gori (1737-43, 1, pl. 90). Flaxman renders the group frontally at eye level which gives the best view of the warrior's body. The drawing is carefully worked up, with thin and precise outlines and subtle but extensive tonal modelling in grey wash. The soft lines that denote the feathers of the wings are rendered with wash, showing Flaxman's tight control of any medium he uses. See also UCL Journal, ff. 2or/2ir (for a similar figurative bronze lid handle Flaxman saw in Portici). 2) (r.) Satyr playing double pipe A similarly delicate drawing is this study of a satyr playing a double flute (bronze statuette, formerly Uffizi, now Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Florence (Reinach 1920-30, 11, i, p. 140, no. 6)). The study reflects Flaxman's interest in Bacchic subjects (see, for example, V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, ff. 4r, 5r, 38r, 39r, 4or, 4ir). See also UCL Journal, f. 2or (for a reference to a similar statuette in Portici). //p. 114 [unused] //p. 115 (Fig. 58) after Etruscan sculpture Three studies after Etruscan bronze statuettes Graphite, pen and ink, and wash (images turned 900 clockwise) 1) (1. 1.) Two warriors (one largely lost) carrying a fallen soldier This is another group that originally served as a handle of the lid on a bronze vessel. As in the case of the other Etruscan figures, Flaxman chose an object in the classical style (fourth century bc; Florence, Museo Nazionale Archeologico; Razeto 1985, p. 30). The attending figure may have been of interest to him in the context of the Homeric epic where the recovery of fallen heroes features in a number of scenes. 2) (u. r.) Head of statuette of Mercury in profile to left 3) (1. r.) Head of statuette of Mercury from front Flaxman copies solely the head of a classical Etruscan statuette of Mercury that survived intact and is now in the Museo Nazionale Archeologico (inv. no. 1718). As so often, Flaxman draws the figure from the front and the side in order to reconstruct the three-dimensional object. He completes both drawings to the same high degree of finish. This may have been in response to the elaborate hairstyle and detailing of the wings, if not the intrinsic beauty of the small object. I am indebted to Annegret Höhler, Florence, for her extensive help with the identification of the Etruscan statuettes from the collections of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale. //p. 116 [unused] Rome, Palazzo Ruspoli //p. 117 (Fig. 59) after ancient sculpture The Marble Faun Graphite and pen and ink Inscribed in ink, 1. r.: Palace Ruspoli Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 276, pl. 55, fig. e The specific sculpture of the Marble Faun that Flaxman copied in this drawing was one of two copies that belonged to the collection of the Palazzo Ruspoli. Like its companion, the present figure was sold in 1812 to the Glyptothek in Munich, where, sadly, it has since been stripped of all modern restorations, including its ancient, but not original, head (marble, height before removal of head 181 cm, after removal 155 cm, head on its own 29 cm; inv. nos. Gl 229 and Gl 229A (the head); Brunn 1887, p. 141, no. 106; Vierneisel-Schlörb 1979, n. 32, pp. 353-63, figs. 172-79). The satyr is leaning on a tree trunk, he has a panther skin draped around his right shoulder; fixed to the tree are a pan flute and a strigil. 250</page><page sequence="255">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 Winckelmann mentions both copies in the palazzo as amongst the most beautiful of their type (Winckel- mann 1767 (1821), 11, p. 73 and Winckelmann 1764 (2006), p. 205). The type itself has been identified since Winckelmann as the Satyr of Praxiteles and came in the nineteenth century to great fame through Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel The Marble Faun , published in i860. Hawthorne refers to a copy in the Capitoline Museum (Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 210). Another famous copy belonged to the Giustiniani Collection (Sandrart 163 1-?, I, p. 129; Perrier 1638, pl. 45; for a list of copies, see Klein 1898, pp. 204-05). Flaxman may have been interested in the type as a representation of a soft and less athletic male body in contrast to the heroic types that were represented, for example, by the Phidian Horse Tamer. See Flaxman 1829, pp. 90, 280 (on the Satyr by Praxiteles). //p. 118 [unused] Florence, Loggia dei Lanzi //p. 119 (Fig- 60) after ancient sculpture Two views of a Sabine Woman Graphite and pen and ink (images turned 900 clockwise) 1) (1.) frontal view 2) (r.) from the right This sculpture was first documented in the sixteenth century as part of a group of six Sabine Women in the della Valle courtyard (marble, height 249 cm, first century ad after fourth century original; Diitschke 1874-82, m (1878), p. 256, cat. no. 560; Capecchi 1975, p. 172; Bober and Rubinstein 1986, pp. 198-99, no. 166). In 1584 it was bought for the Villa Medici together with the other statues of the group. In 1787 or later the group was transported to Florence, where in 1789 it was installed in the Loggia dei Lanzi (Capecchi 1975, p. 170; Bober and Rubinstein, 1986, p. 199). The group has been reproduced frequently since the Renaissance (Capecchi 1975, p. 170, for an extensive list). Among a number of seventeenth-century engravings are those by Perrier (1638, pls. 76 (the present figure), 78 and 79). Since the nineteenth century the figure is known as 'Thusnelda' (Bober and Rubinstein 1986, no. 166, pp. 198-99). Flaxman probably made this drawing in summer 1794 in the Loggia dei Lanzi. The two complementary views would have enabled him to understand the pose of this sculpture in all three dimensions. As a depiction of a mourning woman, the figure would have provided a useful motif for illustrations and tomb sculpture alike. //p. 120 [unused] //p. 121 (Fig. 61) after Benvenuto Cellini Perseus , full-length in profile to right Graphite Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 282 This is the first of a set of three drawings after Cellini's Perseus (pp. 121-23, 129). This group of drawings documents Flaxman's renewed excitement about this sculpture, presumably during the summer of 1794. In 1787 Flaxman had made three careful analytical sketches that recorded the sculpture (Yale Sketchbook, ff. 3r and 5r). In addition to the frontal view of the earlier set, the present sketch provides a profile view that describes the stance and emphasizes the slender forms of the figure.

It shows the sculpture from a viewpoint slightly further to the front and considerably further away. For the second drawing Flaxman has come closer to the sculpture that appears now strictly in profile. The steep angle of vision adds the visual drama to the image that Cellini intended and Flaxman sought to reduce in his earlier drawings in the Yale Sketchbook. Flaxman omits any internal modelling and the drawing conveys the beauty of the original while lacking its severity. See this sketchbook, pp. 121, 123, 129; Yale Sketchbook, ff. 3r (also for a discussion of the sculpture) and f. 5r; Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 2v. //p. 123 (Fig. 62) after Benvenuto Cellini Perseus from the back Graphite and pen and ink Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 282 Here Flaxman draws from a high viewpoint for which he may have had to step onto the bench that runs along the back wall of the Loggia dei Lanzi. The drawing is particularly instructive for the understanding of the figure of Medusa, but it also provides a clear rendering of the narrative as Medusa's body appears shattered on the ground with Perseus striding triumphantly forward. The fine tonal modelling is almost entirely achieved through smudged graphite, while pen and ink are used to fix outlines and to indicate passages that are behind others, such as the head of Medusa that appears behind Perseus' arm and hand.

Flaxman's drawings are made from below and from slightly oblique viewpoints. The first one, very close to a frontal view, provides a more intact view of the body of Christ which in the intended frontal view is twisted backwards to the beholder's left. The view from the side in study 2 provides further information about the positions and poses of the individual figures and especially that of the Virgin Mary. Both drawings are carefully worked up using wash for internal modelling as well as to indicate areas of recession. Flaxman describes the form of the work, but gives no information about the unfinished surface of large parts of the sculpture. Cf.

NZ 184 Margaret Whinney was the first to recognize that this lateral view of the tomb of Giuliano de' Medici relates to Flaxman's work on the Mansfield monument, commissioned from him in 1792 (Irwin 1979, pp. 63-66). On Michelangelo's tomb for Giuliano de' Medici, see Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 14-25, 327-38, esp. 333-34, figs. 17, 24, 31). The drawing is most likely to date from Flaxman's last visit to Florence in summer 1794. During his first stay in Florence in 1787, Flaxman had completed a group of drawings of the monuments in the New Sacristy that privileged a frontal view and showed a preference for the tomb of Giuliano. See this sketchbook, p. 126 above; Yale Sketchbook, ff. 23r (for Flaxman's reception of Michelangelo's tombs in the New Sacristy), 24r, 25r, 26r; Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 14V; Flaxman 1829, pp. 319-20.

Flaxman shows the figure without the head and the entire right arm, as well as large parts of the left lower arm that reaches down towards the head of the animal. All of these omitted parts are listed by Mansuelli as modern additions. Gori's image confirms that Flaxman saw the work already in its modern complete form, which suggests that he was making an antiquarian point and most likely disagreeing with the restoration. The study is carefully worked up to a high degree of finish and puts particular emphasis on the rendering of the drapery as it reveals and veils the Nymph's body. The sculpture is one of many Bacchic motifs that Flaxman studied in Italy. The intrinsically sexual dimension of this work is by no means suppressed by Flaxman who could easily have omitted the animal that with its gaze directs the beholder's eyes towards the nymph's veiled pubic area. //p. 132 [unused] //p. 133 (Fig. 69) after ancient sculpture A Woman holding a small plate, frontal view Graphite, pen and ink, and wash This statue of a woman covered in a himation and holding a small plate is of unknown provenance and does not feature in any accounts of the Uffizi prior to 1782 (marble, height 180 cm, inv. no. 30; Mansuelli 1958-61, i (1958), pp. 138-39, no. 104). Flaxman made three studies of the statue, one from the front and two, on p. 135, from the sides. The classical motif of the worthy woman, fully clad in her drapery, would have been of great use for his own illustrations and tomb sculpture. The three views record the stance, pose and drapery of the entire figure. //p. 134 [unused] //p. 135 (Fig. 70) after ancient sculpture Three studies from sculpture (images turned 900 clockwise) 1) (1.)

In the eighteenth century, the passages in classical literature about the Doriphoros were well known, as was this sculpture of a young athlete and other copies of the type in Rome and Naples. However, it was not until 1862/63 that the type was identified (Schneider 1990, p. 480). In fact, Flaxman mentions in his Lectures that '[h]is Doryphorus, or spear-bearer, from which sculptors copied the rules of art, is known to us only from Pliny's description' (Flaxman 1829, p. 281). In this drawing with its subtle modelling, Flaxman renders the Florentine Doriphoros from a relatively close viewpoint. He lowers the forehead and broadens shoulder and neck slightly. See the possible reference to this work in the Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 8v with n. 65: [Etruscan Bronzes] An athleta (cast in R.A.London) very fine ; Flaxman 1829, pp. 90, 281. //p. 138 [unused] //p. 139 (Fig- 72) after Greek bronze sculpture A male torso Graphite and light grey wash The lines of breakage of this torso enable us to identify the source for this drawing beyond doubt as the famous bronze torso that is now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Florence (inv. no. 1638, height 94 cm, Greek, fifth century bc; Richter 1970, p. 150, cat. no. 195, figs. 585-88; Esposito and Guidotti 1999, p. 55). Flaxman draws this figure entirely with graphite, rendering carefully the internal modelling, but also reflecting the dark colour of the bronze. A first attempt (turned 90o clockwise) in graphite is discernible at the bottom left. Flaxman abandoned it and covered it with the final drawing.

Three studies after a male model and two compositional studies [?] Graphite (images turned by 1800) The two drawings in the upper part of this page depict the model wearing a shirt. In the upper left the model is kneeling in profile to the right the right arm stretched forward (similar to a kneeling magus in representations of The Adoration of the Magi). A single outline of the same figure to the right and above the drawing suggests that Flaxman had first started it further to the right and then run out of space. The second figure, in the centre right, is shown seated with one arm raised in rhetorical gesticulation. The third drawing on the lower left is of a male nude, seated frontally, two fingers touching the ground and looking up at the beholder. Next to this figure on the bottom right, Flaxman draws two compositional sketches, on the left, three figures seem to lean over a table, on the right a single figure, seated on a plinth, is approached by one or two figures from below. //p. 143 [unused] //p. 144 (Fig. 76) after life Five studies of a male nude Graphite (images turned by 1 8o°) All five drawings are studies of the reclining model in varying poses, lying on the side or back, and studied from different angels, including the front, back, and top of the head.

Four preparatory studies for the figure of Justice for the Mansfield Monument Graphite (images turned by 1800) 256</page><page sequence="261">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 Like the following four pages, this one is dedicated to sketches relating to the Mansfield tomb (Irwin 1979, pp. 63-66; Coltman 2007). Here Flaxman is studying the pose and fall of drapery of a standing figure in positions that are similar to that of the figure of Justice in the completed monument. In the two drawings at the top Flaxman investigates the fall of drapery; in the central drawing he thinks through the underlying pose by drawing a nude figure from memory. In terms of its stance this is closest to the final figure. The drawing at the bottom right is another drapery study, but differs from the others as here more of the stance is revealed. For further life studies for the Mansfield monument, see this sketchbook, pp. 15, 140, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160; for studies after other monuments in the context of the Mansfield commission, see this sketchbook, pp. 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 and 127; for further preparatory drawings for the tomb, see Wright in Bindman 2003, pp. 45-46, cat. nos. 3a-d. //p. 151 [unused] //p. 152 (Fig. 80) after life and from memory Three preparatory drawings for the Mansfield Monument Graphite (images turned by 1800) The large central study on this page depicts a model dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and mantle seated in a chair with armrests. This is a preparatory study for the seated figure at the centre of the Mansfield monument, though neither cloak nor gesture are similar to the final monument or even appropriate for the subject. The small sketch of a crouching figure next to it may represent a first idea for the Genius of death that appears at the back of the tomb, while the study of a standing dressed female figure may or may not relate to the project. For further life studies for the Mansfield monument, see this sketchbook, pp. 15, 140, 150, 154, 156, 158, 160, esp. 150; for studies after other monuments in the context of the Mansfield commission, pp. 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 and 127; for further preparatory drawings for the tomb, see Wright in Bindman 2003, pp. 45-46, cat. nos. 3a- d. //p. 153 [unused] //p. 154 (Fig. 81) From memory (and after life?) Five preparatory drawings for the Mansfield Monument Graphite (images turned by 1800) The central study, though with mirror-reversed hand gestures, is very close to the final seated portrait figure of Lord Mansfield. The figure is wearing the heavy cloak, collar, chain and wig of the judge. Above this study are three almost illegibly faint sketches for the figure from front and both sides. A small study on the right shows a figure in a similar pose from the side. The purpose of this drawing is to study the fall of the drapery and especially the heavy cloak as seen from the side. In the final monument the mantle is contained within the armrests of the chair.

In the lower left-hand corner Flaxman sketched very roughly a seated man from the front, the arms crossed, face covered by the left hand. It may not relate to the project. For further life studies for the Mansfield monument, see this sketchbook, pp. 15, 140, 150, 152, 154, 158, 160, esp. 150; for studies after other monuments in the context of the Mansfield commission, pp. 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 and 127; for further preparatory drawings for the tomb, see Wright in Bindman 2003, pp. 45-46, cat. nos. 3a-d. //p. 157 [unused] //p. 158 (Fig. 83) after life Three drapery studies for the Mansfield Monument Graphite (images turned by 1800) In this set of drawings Flaxman studies the possible fall of the drapery of the seated figure on top of the monument. The main drawing renders the frontal view. The upper body of the figure is roughly sketched, but the heavy folds of the drapery on and around the legs are carefully described. The two smaller drawings omit the upper body entirely; they are very basic outline sketches of the drapery as seen in profile to the left (c. r.) and in profile to the right (1. r.).

Again, the gestures and posture of the upper body are only roughly indicated. Two smaller studies below record the fall of drapery around the legs as seen from either side. For further life studies for the monument, see this sketchbook, pp. 15, 140, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, esp. 150; for studies after other monuments in the context of the Mansfield commission, pp. 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 and 127; for further preparatory drawings for the tomb, see Wright in Bindman 2003, pp. 45-46, cat. nos. 3a-d. //p. 161 [unused] //p. 162 (Fig. 85) conceptual drawing A study of the Extent of Motion in the Skeleton Graphite and pen and ink (image turned by 1 8o°) An engraving after this drawing was published in Flaxman 1829, pl. 27, under the title Extent of Motion in the Skeleton to illustrate the limits of potential motion of all parts of a standing human figure. It relates to his lecture 'On science' (Flaxman 1829, pp. 100-33, esp. p. 127). Flaxman has indicated the 'lines of motion' in graphite, while the human figure is retraced with pen and ink. In the present context the drawing relates to the drafted treatise 'Character outline Proportions and Anatomy of the Human Figure of the Greeks' that he wrote on the following pages. 258</page><page sequence="263">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook e 442-1937 Location of source unknown //p. 163 (Fig. 86) after unidentified ancient relief (?)

The name of the spring is Hermes' stream and the fish in it are not caught, being considered sacred to the god. Quite close to the image stand square stones, about thirty in number. These the people of Pharai adore, calling each by the name of some god. At a more remote period all the Greeks alike worshipped uncarved stones instead of images of the gods.' Pausanias, Description of Greece , 7. 22.4. Cf. Flaxman 1829, p. 55. 3 Flaxman refers here to the square bases of ancient herms; the connection between the square stones and the shape of the herm is already made by Pausanias. 4 Cf. Flaxman 1829, pp. 108-09. 5 See Lalande 1769, in, pp. 249-50; see also Flaxman 1829, pp. 39, 49, where the author refers to Egyptian statues in the Capitoline Museum. Possibly the Aspasia' type or Amelung's Goddess. Flaxman drew one of these in the Giustiniani collection in the Yale Sketchbook. Two others, originally also in the Giustiniani collection, are in the Museo Capitolino where Flaxman would have seen them, explaining why he refers to them in plural. See Yale Sketchbook, f. Ó2r. 7 Flaxman 1829, pp. 76-77 refers in a similar context to a figure of Bacchus in the Villa Albani and states that it was discussed by Winckelmann. It is possible that both passages refer to the fragmented, but originally over life-size, statue of Bacchus in this collection, mentioned by Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 201-02. 8 There are a number of statues of Minerva in the 'severe' style in the Albani collection. It seems most likely that Flaxman had nos. 62 or 183 in Visconti 1885, pp. 38-39, 128-29 in mind; cf. Flaxman 1829, p. 76. 9 This bronze sculpture is mentioned by Winckelmann 1764 (2006), pp. 164, 168, 171 and described as four palmi high and holding a cornucopia (horn of plenty). It has not been traced in the modern literature. 10 Plato, Meno 97d; Plato Euthyphro nd; the myth is mentioned by other ancient writers, cf. Morris 1992, pp. 216-37; cf. Flaxman 1829, p. 55. 11 This is an Etruscan mirror, dating about 500-475 bc, that represents Hercules abducting Mlacuch (their names are inscribed in the scene). It entered the British Museum in 1772 as part of the collection of William Hamilton.

OBLONG SKETCHBOOK USED BY JOHN FLAXMAN DURING HIS STAY IN ITALY AND ON HIS RETURN JOURNEY UP TO INNSBRUCK (Victoria &amp; Albert Museum) Edited and catalogued by Eckart Marchand Editor's Note The sketchbook consists of 71 folios. It measures approximately 16.5 X38.6 cm, including the cover. The pages have never been cut down and measure approximately 15.5 x 37.3 cm. The book cover is made of vellum; two strings, now ripped, could originally be used to tie the book. The sheets are made of Italian paper, the paper has a watermark with a Florentine lily in a circle and, underneath it, the letter 'M' In the literature the book is referred to by two inventory numbers (B2C and 2790) and its shelf number (100A7). In this pub- lication it is regularly referred to as V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790. The book has been completed in graphite, pen and ink, and grey wash. Inscriptions are limited to indications of location and authorship, and occasionally the name of an object. In addition, Flaxman wrote a few notes into the front and back covers. There is no original pagination, but a posthumously introduced folio numbering. The main part of the book consists of drawings after reliefs, mosaics and paintings in Rome, Florence, Siena, Pisa, Orvieto, Verona and Innsbruck, as well as a tracing of a book illumination, completed on tracing paper and glued into the volume. Three drawings of motifs at Pisa and Orvieto are by William Young Ottley. They are likely to be copies of drawings by Ottley that in Rome he inserted into Flaxman's sketchbook. All other works are by John Flaxman. The period of use and chronology of the drawings in the volume cannot be tightly established. It is possible that drawings on ff. 2r to 22r were executed one after the other at Rome (with the only exception of the tracing on f. 2or which may or may not derive from the final part of the journey). An exact post quem date for these earliest drawings cannot be established, but as the first drawing apparently relates to a commission of drawings by Edward Knight from the years 1788-91 (see Yale Sketchbook, ff. 79V, 8or and 8ov) it is likely that it was executed relatively early on in this period. The final sketches on f. Ó9r are latest in date. They depict monuments in Verona and Innsbruck that Flaxman saw during his journey home in autumn 1794. It cannot be ruled out that the order of the remaining drawings reflects that of their completion, but the sequence of the locations (Siena, Lucca, Pisa, Florence, Siena, Pisa, Rome, Orvieto, Rome, Florence, Rome, Buonconvento, Siena, Florence, Pisa) rather suggests that Flaxman drew them into the book at random. After the death of Flaxman's sister-in-law and adopted daughter, Maria Denman, the sketchbook was sold on 10 April 1862 at Christie and Manson's, London as lot 445. It was bought by the South Kensington Museum for £14 75. 1 Editorial Conventions The sequence of the catalogue follows strictly that of the sketchbook. The modern folio numbering has been adopted as it is consistent and legible even in the reproductions. To avoid confusion, no additional catalogue numbers have been introduced. Where Flaxman identified drawings on the back of a sheet, the inscription is transcribed in the entry for the recto and cross-referenced in the entry of the verso (or vice versa), through [inscribed as mentioned above]. Empty pages are marked '[unused]'. With regard to inscriptions, Flaxman's spelling, capitalization and punctuation have been transcribed as seen, with editorial insertions reduced to a minimum and marked by square brackets, for example, [.]. [sic] indicates an originally misspelled word, repeated word, etc. Triangular brackets have been used to indicate either an illegible passage, or a word that can only be guessed, e.g. &lt;. . .&gt;. Single or double strikethroughs have been used as they appear in the journal. 287</page><page sequence="291">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 Inscriptions that postdate Flaxman's own have been transcribed where they appear in the front cover and back cover. No references have been made to Museum stamps and the inventory numbers that are written in black ink onto all versos. //FRONT BOOK COVER, INSIDE (Fig. 1) A street map and the front elevation of a temple Graphite (images turned by 1800) Study 1) Map of a square Study 2) Portico of a hexastyle temple with a decorated pediment (image turned by 1 8o°) Inscribed in graphite: 3 The map shows a rectangular square with five road entries and a temple on its upper left-hand corner that apparently blocks two of the roads. Near the centre of the square is a monument or fountain. At the lower right-hand side of the map Flaxman draws the elevation of a hexastyle temple. The pediment is decorated with sculpture. An identification of the square and/or the building is difficult, as there is no indication whether the two drawings relate, whether either of the elements were located in the city of Rome, and whether the temple design is a reconstruction or description of an existing building.

Inscribed in graphite (c.r.): B2C //f. ir (Fig. 2) after life and after ancient monuments Three slight sketches Graphite As is the case with his other sketchbooks and journals, Flaxman seems to have returned to a page he had initially left blank, in a rather haphazard way, to add unrelated sketches. The three drawings here do not relate to one another. 1) (1.) A study of a knee after life This frontal study of a standing model's right knee relates to a series of similar studies in V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937; see, for example, p. 61. 2) (c.) The plan of the basement of the Mausoleum of Maxentius on the via Appia outside Rome (?) This plan of a round building in a square courtyard may represent the basement of the Mausoleum of Maxentius near the via Appia, about 1 mile outside of Rome (begun c. ad 306). The drawing perpetuates mistakes/ omissions of earlier sixteenth-century drawings as it does not include the frontal podium (Campbell 2004, il, pp. 495-96, no. 174). Flaxman positions the building correctly in an arcaded rectangular courtyard that he mistakenly reconstructs as a square (Campbell 2004, 1, pp. 386-87, no. 130). I am grateful to Ian Campbell, Edinburgh College of Art, for discussing this identification with me. 288</page><page sequence="292">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 In Rome, Flaxman had contacts with architect friends, including the Frenchman Charles Percier (Irwin i979î P- 49)- The present drawing may have been produced in conversation with such friends. A similar drawing in the Yale Sketchbook (f. 74V) might represent a reconstruction of Trajan's Forum. 3) (r.) An ancient sarcophagus in front of a niche with a herm This drawing is impossible to decipher in reproduction. Flaxman represents a rectangular recess or niche appropriate for a courtyard or garden. It is framed with pilasters bearing a complete entablature. Inside the niche stands a herm that is decorated with a garland. Before the niche stands a tub-shaped sarcophagus with a figurative relief.

It was copied in the Codex Pighianus (1547-55; Jahn 1868, p. 212, n. 155, f. 305, reproduced in Matz in ASR, iv, 3 (1969), Beilage 106). An engraving of it was published in Sandrart (163 1-?, 11, pl. 104; mirror reversed) and Flaxman's contemporary Henry Tresham copied it between 1775 and 1789 (Robert 1897, pp. 65, 342). As discussed by Matz, the relief is a pastiche made up of three different sarcophagi; the seated figure on the left and the centaur on the right (copied by Flaxman on f. 3r) do not belong to the central composition. The relief is generally in bad condition and heavily restored. The central scene is now identified as Pentheus Killed by Maenads. In 1793, the sculptor Vincenzo Pacetti mentioned the relief in his brief description of the sculptures in the Palazzo as 'un Bacchanale con un Centauro che suona la lira' ( Documenti inediti 1878-80, iv (1880), pp. 421 and IV). Early on in the nineteenth century, it was identified by Visconti as The Death of Pentheus (Visconti 1818-22, m (1819), pp. 187-88). The relief was presumably restored to represent The Death of Orpheus and it is this reading that Flaxman fol- lowed. He recorded the sale of a drawing of this subject matter in 179 1 to Edward Knight and a separate draw- ing, more highly finished than those in Flaxman's sketchbooks, is kept at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Univer- sity of Manchester. The separate drawing clearly follows the present design (including the scene on f. 3r) but seems to be unfinished on the right-hand side. Irwin therefore rules out the possibility that it is the final draw- ing that was sold to Knight. Flaxman's own inscription on the Manchester drawing, cropped in Irwin's repro- duction, might suggest otherwise (Irwin 1979, p. 45, fig. 53; see Bindman 1979, p. 78, cat. no. 82a for a reproduction that includes the inscription; Yale Sketchbook, f. 8or and v for Flaxman's notes relating to the commission by Mr Knight) . The inscription provides us with Flaxman's reading of the relief and is worth quoting: 289</page><page sequence="293">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 Eurydice killed by the serpent, Orpheus in despair for her death, afterwards torn in pieces by the circonian women, part of the front of a marble sarcophagus in the wall of the cortile of the palace Giustiniani, Rome. The figures about 22 inches high, of very ordinary workmanship though of a noble composition, some [of] the heads are broken off as well as the most projecting arms and the original workmanship is imperfect where the drawing appears so. Flaxman may have bought the oblong sketchbook specifically to copy sarcophagus reliefs. Yet, it was only after the first few drawings that he had worked out how to use it. On this first page he drew the figures to the full height of the folio and as a result ran out of space at the right-hand side. He then started to draw the final section in the left-hand part of f. 3r, but abandoned this, only to redraw this part of the composition on the very right-hand side. The final arrangement would allow the reader to push f. 2r gently to the left until its right-hand border and the left-hand border of the image on f. 3r lined up and formed a continuous frieze. Later Flaxman would use verso and recto of two consecutive folios to reproduce such long sarcophagus compositions. //f. 2v [unused] //f. 3r (Fig. 4) after ancient sarcophagus relief The Death of Orpheus [Pentheus Killed by Maenads] , det.: right-hand section Graphite The abandoned sketch on the left and the drawing on the right-hand side are both of the same part of the composition of this sarcophagus; see f. 2r for a discussion of the sarcophagus and Flaxman's drawing procedure. The present scene shows a centaur with a lyre and two youths standing behind him. //f. 3v [unused] Rome, Villa Medici (garden façade) //f. 4r (Fig. 5) after ancient sarcophagus relief Bacchic scenes, det: The Consecration of a Woman for the Bacchic Cult Graphite Inscribed in black ink on verso: Villa Medicis This is the left-hand half of a Bacchic sarcophagus (marble, second century ad; Cagiano de Azevedo 195 1, pp. 71-73, cat. no. 58; Matz in ASR, iv, 3 (1969), pp- 378-80, no. 210, pl. 221; Chastel 1989-91, 1, p. 325, no. 434). The sarcophagus front is decorated from left to right with the scenes of the consecration of a woman for the Bacchic cult (copied on the present folio), Pan playing a flute (copied on f. 5r) and The Finding of Ariadne (not studied by Flaxman in this sketchbook). It was bought from the della Valle collection in 1584 and later inserted into the garden façade of the Villa Medici (Cagiano de Azevedo 195 1, p. 71, no. 58). It was copied frequently in the Renaissance (see Matz in ASR, iv, 3 (1969), p. 378). The present drawing represents the consecration of a woman in the Bacchic cult. The scene is situated in a Bacchic sanctuary and overlooked by a god who appears seated on a mount on the left-hand side. The initiated woman is standing frontally at the centre, a building in the back on the left and a herm of Bacchus identify the site. Flaxman may not have seen the front of a temple that in the relief appears in low relief behind the initiated woman, but the fact that he crops the lower part of the composition, including the feet of the seated priestess and the lower part of the crater behind her, does not relate to the low view point. Photographs that show the lower part of the relief exposed (e.g. Matz in ASR, iv, 3 (1969), pl. 221) were apparently made during a restoration campaign in 1938 before and after which this part of the relief seems to have been covered with plaster to provide a straight bottom line. Thus a drawing from Cassiano dal Pozzo 's collection as well as modern photographs (e.g. Fig. 12, p. 39 of this volume) also show the bottom strip covered up, while earlier drawings that recorded the work in the della Valle collection represent the complete relief (Matz in ASR, iv, 3 (1969), p. 378). Finally it should be noted that Flaxman's drawing does not record any of the damages to the relief, such as the nearly complete loss of the initiated woman's face (see Marchand in this volume, pp. 40-41). 290</page><page sequence="294">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 //f. 4v [inscribed as mentioned above] //{. 5r (Fig. 6) after ancient sarcophagus relief Bacchic scenes, det.: Pan Playing a Flute Graphite Flaxman may have intended to copy the entire right-hand side of this sarcophagus from the garden façade of the Villa Medici (see above, f. 4r), as he left enough space for it on this folio. In the end he only drew the small scene of Pan Playing a Flute , omitting The Finding of Ariadne which shows Bacchus accompanied by three fauns and a panther as he discovers the sleeping Ariadne. //f. 5v [unused] //f. 6r (Fig- 7) after ancient sarcophagus relief Hippolytus Sarcophagus, det: central composition Graphite Inscribed in black ink on verso: Villa Medicis This relief derives like the preceding one (ff. 4r and 5r) from the della Valle collection and was inserted around 1584 into the garden façade of the Villa Medici (marble, no x 235 cm, third century ad; Rogge in ASR, iv, 3 (1969), pp. 154-55, cat- no- 63, pls. 98.1 and 99). At this stage the picture field of the badly damaged and fragmented relief was enlarged and tall trees added above the figures. In fact, the three male figures on the left do not belong to the original composition either (Rogge as above, p. 154). Flaxman only copies the figurai composition, omitting any obvious additions. The degree of finish varies within this drawing. The young men at the centre, including Hyppolytus, are most carefully described, while on the right-hand side the female group has not been developed beyond the initial outline. Here we recognize the seated figure of Phaedra. The care with which Flaxman worked at least on certain passages of this drawing might indicate that he had a commis- sion in mind and/or that he recognized the high quality of the work, particularly in the rendering of the male anatomy. //f. 6v [Inscribed as mentioned above] Palazzo Santa Croce //f. 7r (Fig. 8) after ancient Roman relief Sea Thiasos or The Wedding of Neptune and Amphitrite, det: Triton and Nereids [The Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus ] Graphite Inscribed in black ink: Palace Santa Croce The so-called Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus was most likely a rectangular base, decorated with four marble reliefs. In the late nineteenth century the monument, of which only the reliefs survive, was imagined to have been an altar, but it is now identified as a base for a sculpture and dated near the beginning of the first century bc (Kleiner 1992, pp. 49-51; Kahler 1966, esp. pp. 35-36 (for date)). One side of the monument was decorated with a Census scene, a historical Roman event, the other three sides represent a Sea Thiasos. First mentioned in 1681, the reliefs were later inserted into the walls of the inner courtyard of the Palazzo S. Croce. In 181 1 they were sold to Cardinal Fesch, an uncle of Napoleon I, who sold them again in 18 16. At this point the Sea Thiasos was acquired by Ludwig Klenze for the Glyptothek in Munich. Eight years later the Census relief entered the Louvre (Kähler 1966, pp. 7-8). The Census and Sea Thiasos are described by Johann Bernoulli in his Zusätze zu den neuesten Reisebeschreibungen von Italien , 1, Leipzig, 1777, p. 437 (cited after Kähler 1966, p. 37, no. 37). They are also discussed by Winckelmann (1767 (1821), 11, p. 361) who (mistakenly) rejected the Census relief as a modern work made of stucco. There are five drawings of the Sea Thiasos by Flaxman's contemporary Henry Tresham 291</page><page sequence="295">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 (1775 and 1789, Kahler 1966, p. 7, n. 11; Robert 1897, p. 52, nos. 254-58). Like Tresham, Flaxman only studied this set of reliefs. He may have drawn the reliefs (fF. 7r, 8 v and 9r, and iov and nr) in preparation for a group of three drawings that he sold to Mr Edward Knight (Y ale Sketchbook, f. 8ov with note 23 on page 157 of this volume). One of these has survived and is now kept at the British Museum; it is a copy of the present drawing (Bindman 1979, p. 79, no. 82b). The relief depicted in this study must have decorated the right-hand side of the monument. It represents two nerides and a triton riding on a seamonster. The scene is worked up to a higher finish than the two following, larger drawings, possibly to indicate the standard of the final drawings that were to be dispatched to Mr Knight. The tail end of a sea bull from the next relief appears before the pilaster on the right and indicates the continuation of the frieze. //f. jv [unused] //f. 8r [unused] //fF. 8v and 9r (Fig- 9) after ancient Roman relief Sea Thiasos ( The Wedding of Neptune and Amphitrite), det: central part of composition [The Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus ] Graphite Inscribed in graphite under foot of seated figure on the right: too near Inscribed in black ink, 1. r.: Palace Santa Croce This drawing is part of a group of three (ff. yr, 8 v and 9r, and iov and nr; for the group and the monument, see f. 7r). For the first time in this volume Flaxman uses the full width of the opened sketchbook. The drawing reproduces two-thirds of the relief from one of the long sides, most likely the back, of the monument. The last section from the right-hand side of this relief can be found on ff. iov and 1 ir, where it appears in continuation with the relief from the second short side. On the very right-hand side of the present drawing appear Neptune and Amphitrite as they are seated in a chariot that is drawn by two tritons. Behind and to their sides appears a curtain, possibly a reference to the wedding chamber. From the left-hand side a seabull and sea horse approach the couple carrying nereids with tributes and presents (Kleiner 1992, p. 49). //f. 9v [unused] //f. ior after ancient Roman relief Preparatory page layout for an abandoned relief composition Flaxman prepared this page with two horizontal lines to establish the picture field required for the image now on ff. iov and nr in a smaller scale, using only one sheet. He then abandoned the page as he decided to draw the remaining reliefs of the Sea Thiasos at the same scale as the previous drawings, using the following double page (ff. iov and nr). //ff. iov and iir (Fig- 10) after ancient Roman relief Sea Thiasos , det.: right-hand side with nereides, winged putti, tritons and seamonsters [The Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus ] Graphite Inscribed in black ink, 1. r.: Palace Santa Croce This is the third drawing of this group (ff. 7r, 8 v and 9r, and iov and nr; for a wider discussion of drawings and monument see f. 7r). 292</page><page sequence="296">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 The left-hand side of the present drawing represents the last section of the relief panel studied by Flaxman in the previous drawing (ff. 8v and 9r). Another sea creature, half-horse half-fish is directed by a winged putto as it carries a nereid towards the couple. A pilaster indicates the division between this end of the long panel and the adjacent relief from the second short side of the monument. This third and final relief represents a triton and two nereids riding on a seamonster. Flaxman has drawn this part of the design with greater economy, the face of the central triton, for example, only exists in its outlines. //f. i IV [unused] Rome, Palazzo Giustiniani //f. I2r (Fig. il) after ancient Roman relief Two couples reclining Graphite Inscribed in black ink 1. r.: Palace Gustiniani [sic] Two couples, the men reclining, the women seated, are shown in high relief against a plain relief ground. The relief, presumably from a funerary context, is illustrated in Sandrart 1631-?, 11, pl. 92, but its whereabouts are unknown and the object has not been traced in the modern literature. There are signs of modern restorations as the male head on the left seems to be that of a god, possibly Jupiter, the one on the right instead a portrait. Flaxman has rendered the left-hand couple in greater detail and only outlined the one on the right. //f. I2V [unused] Rome, S. Marìa Maggiore (Apse) //f. I3r (Fig. 12) as after fifth-century mosaic [Jacopo Torriti] The Nativity Graphite Inscribed in graphite on the right: a Mosaic of the 3th Century / in S:a Maria Maggiore Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280; Bindman 1979, p. 80, cat. no. 85. The few drawings after non-classical works that Flaxman made were mostly after what he considered to be early Christian images. The mosaics in the nave of S. Maria Maggiore date from the fifth century and, like other eighteenth-century authors, Flaxman took the thirteenth-century decoration of the apse to be of the same date (see, e.g., Lalande 1769, in, p. 419). The Nativity is the second narrative from the left directly below the vault (completed 1296; Tomei 1990, p. 102, pl. 25). Flaxman indicates with faint graphite lines the pointed window arches that form the irregular margins of the picture field. Concentrating on the central figures, he reduces the composition almost to a rectangular field. His design is more classical than that of the model: the difference in scale between the enormous figure of the Virgin and all other figures has been reduced, and the stable is turned into a classical building depicted now consistently from a low viewpoint. The introduction of an angel below and to the right of the star of Bethlehem is a clear misreading of a hill in the landscape. The mistake suggests that other changes may also result from imaginative looking rather than a deliberate correction of the composition. On the right-hand margin, directly next to the window, two shepherds and a tree have been reduced to one single male figure. In his Lectures, Flaxman refers to the subject of The Nativity as a composition by 'Greek Christian' painters, that had been emulated by Italian painters. In the published Lectures an engraving by W. Sherlock, based on the present drawing, is used to illustrate the point (Flaxman 1829, p. 168, pl. 35). See Flaxman 1829, pp. 168, 300-01, pl. 35. //f. 13 v [unused] Rome, S.

At an unknown date it was inserted into the walls of the twelfth-century cloisters of the Lateran (63 x 185 cm, Kleiner 1977, pp. 40, 242, no. 82; Frenz 1985, p. 38, n. 241, p. 40, n. 259. The inscription identifies the figures as freedmen; a married couple, their freeborn son, and the husband's brother. The inscriptions above their heads tell us that at the time of the carving of the relief parents and child were still alive, and that the two men were brothers and fellow carpenters (Kleiner 1977, p. 40). It may have been the display of family relations, the profession of the two men, and/or the representa- tion of the living and the dead in a single monument that made Flaxman copy this particular specimen of what is not an uncommon type of sarcophagus relief. //f. 14V [unused] Rome, S.

Maria in Trastevere to be early Christian (1290s; Hetherington 1979, pp. 130-32, pl. 2). Seventeenth-century watercolours of the entire decoration survive in the Cod. Barb. Lat. 4404, f. I7r (Hetherington 1979, pl. 3) and the decoration is discussed in Lalande 1769, iv, pp. 525-31. Characteristically, Flaxman focuses largely on the figurai composition which in his drawing he endows with a fluidity that is unknown to the original mosaic, where the two women in the foreground form a separate group. Flaxman removes any background features that separate these women from the others, and by focusing on the outlines he collapses the pictorial space and integrates all figures into the gentle curve of his composition. //f. 15 v [unused] //f. i6r (Fig. 15) as after ancient mosaic [Pietro Cavallini, c. 1290s] The Death of the Virgin Graphite Inscribed in brown ink, 1. r.: death of the / Virgin Mary / ancient Mosaic / Sl Mary Trastevere Lit.: Whinney 1956, pp. 277 and 280, pl. 55, fig. b Like the previous drawing this is a study of a mosaic in the apse of S.

Flaxman omits the minute architectural elements behind the two groups of apostles on the right and the left and renders the figures in scale to one another, while in the mosaic Christ, the Virgin, Sts. Peter and Paul are emphasized through their size. 294</page><page sequence="298">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 //f. i6v [unused] Rome, S. Marìa Trastevere (Portico) //f.

Maria in Trastevere (Gerke 1940, pp. 49-51, 339, pl. 2.2). On the left it shows The Three Men in the Kiln , on the right Jonah in the Pumpkin Pergola. The original sarcophagus had a two-tiered front of which the lower part is largely lost. This would have represented Jonah being Thrown into the Sea. Both the bow of the ship and the tail ends of the whale can still be spotted below the kiln and the first of the three men from the left (Gerke 1940, p. 49). Flaxman has incorporated them into the rather crudely drawn whale which is his own reconstruction of the scene. //f. 17V [unused] Rome, Villa Medici (garden façade) //f. i8r (Fig. 17) after ancient sarcophagus relief The Judgment of Paris , det.: two female nudes on the left Graphite This is one of two abandoned attempts by Flaxman to copy the badly damaged relief of The Judgment of Paris that was inserted into the garden façade of the Villa Medici where it is still in situ (marble, 90 x 230 cm, third century ad, Robert in ASR, 11 (1890), no. 11, pp. 13-18, pl. 5; Cagiano de Azevedo 1951, no. 54, pp. 68-69; Chastel 1989, 1, ill., 43 7B). The relief was frequently copied in the Renaissance (Codex Coburgensis, before 1555; Matz 1871, p. 491, no. 199, f. 58; reproduced in Robert as above, pl. 5, fig. 11; Codex Pighianus (1547-55); Jahn 1868, no. 203, f. 259; collection of Cassiano dal Pozzo (before 1657), Windsor, vol. viu, f. 22, old no. 401, new no. 8723; Vermeule 1966, p. 50). It was used selectively as a model by Raphael in a design for an engraving of the same subject by Marcantonio Raimondi (Jones and Penny 1983, p. 179, fig. 186). In the eighteenth century the relief was discussed and reproduced by Spence (1747, p. 246, pl. 34). The relief differs from others copied by Flaxman in terms of its complex two-tiered composition and the very bad state of conservation. In fact, it is obvious that Flaxman wanted to record the composition as if fully intact, as in both sketches he omits references to damage. It is also questionable whether he would have wanted to render the entire two-tiered composition or whether he intended solely to copy the figures on the ground strip. In the present drawing Flaxman started on the left-hand side of the composition with the figures of two nymphs which he rendered in faint outlines. In his second drawing (f. 53r) he would only sketch the central two figures of Venus and a fully armed hero, identified by Robert (p. 17) as Paris after the Judgment. See this sketchbook, f. 53r (for the second drawing), Yale Sketchbook, f. 36r (for a drawing after the Judgement of Paris in the Villa Doria Pamphilij). //f. i8v [unused] Rome, Palazzo Mattei //f. I9r (Fig. 18) after ancient sarcophagus relief The Rape of Proserpina Graphite The relief is inserted into the south wall of the second courtyard of the Palazzo Mattei, above one of the ground-floor windows (marble, front of a child's sarcophagus, 36 x 124 cm according to Bonnano; Robert 295</page><page sequence="299">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 in ASR, in, 3, p. 491, cat. no. 412, pl. 129, fig. 412; Bonnano in Guerrini 1982, pp. 219-20, n. 65). First documented in 161 6, it was published in the eighteenth century in Venuti and Emaduzzi 1779, in, p. 13, pl. 6; Robert as above. This is a very quick sketch of the overall figurai composition executed with thin graphite lines. The group of Pluto carrying Proserpina is notionally more developed than the central encounter of Pluto and Proserpina, while the left-hand scene of Ceres searching Proserpina is extremely loosely sketched and only legible with knowledge of the original composition. The composition of the various reliefs after this subject matter that Flaxman saw in Rome made a strong impact on him as in his Lectures he mentions 'the bas relief [. . .] of the rape of Proserpine' as a Greek compo- sition that gives testimony to the application of arithmetic and geometry (Flaxman 1828, p. 185). Interestingly, he refers to the lost Greek prototype rather than a specific Roman example. Cf. Yale Sketchbook, if. 39r (after another Proserpina relief in the nearby Palazzo Mattei Paganica), 8ov (reference to a drawing after a Rape of Proserpina in the Barberini collection) . Location of source unknown //f. 19V [unused] / /f. 20r (Fig. 19) after the Vienna Genesis (f. 15) Joseph's Dream and Joseph Recounting His Dream Graphite on tracing paper glued into the volume Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280 Whinney identifies this drawing as a tracing after a scene from the Vienna Genesis and suggests that Flaxman might have traced it from the engraving in Lambeck 1670 (1766-70), in, p. 20 (inserted between cols. 20 and 21) or from the original illuminated manuscript in Vienna. A comparison of the measurements of the three images is inconclusive, but a close visual comparison shows that the tracing is closer to the original than the engraving (see, for example, the rendering of the bed posts and drapery on the bed; Gerstinger 193 1, 11, pl. 29). Flaxman may have traced another drawing after the original, but as he returned via Austria a visit to the Imperial Library at Vienna cannot be excluded either. In fact, Whinney reminds us that he mentioned early-medieval paintings from the Vienna collection in his Lectures (Whinney 1956, p. 280; the author refers to Flaxman 1838, p. 243). The Greek origin of the illustrations, testified by the Greek text in the original manuscript, must have attracted Flaxman. The scene of Joseph Recounting His Dream on the right-hand side could have supported his later point that many scenes in early Italian paintings were indebted to Greek compositions (cf. Flaxman 1829, pp. 169, 309). //f. 20V [unused] Rome, Palazzo Lancellotti //f. 2ir (Fig. 20) after ancient sarcophagus relief Scenes from the Life of Medea Graphite Inscribed in black ink, 1. r.: Palace Lancellotti This is Flaxman's second drawing of the right-hand side of the Medea relief in the Palazzo Lancellotti (see Yale Sketchbook, f. 55r, for a discussion of the relief). The present drawing focuses again on the tragic end of the story with The Death of Creuza on the left-hand side, followed by Medea Killing Her Sons and Medea Departing on a Dragon Drawn Chariot. In contrast to the earlier drawing in the Yale Sketchbook this one is more developed, recording details such as drapery patterns and facial expressions. Parallel hatching is used to indicate depth of relief where it is juxtaposed with high relief. But the drawing only represents half the original composition and within this selection Flaxman focuses mainly on what is iconographically important. Thus, 296</page><page sequence="300">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 the figure of a spearbearer on the very right is only noted in its outlines.

In 1872 it was transferred to the Palatine and is now in the Museo delle Terme (60 x 220 cm, second century ad, inv. no. 222; Robert in ASR, il (1890), pp. 215-16, cat. no. 201, pl. 66; Vermeule 1966, p. 68, f. 97, cat. no. 8090). Early drawings of it (before 1657) formerly belonged to the collection of Cassiano dal Pozzo (Windsor, x, f. 97, old no. 47, new no. 8090; Vermeule 1966, p. 68; and British Museum, Franks, I; Vermeule i960, p. 12, f. 43, no. 52, reproduced in Robert as above, fig. 201). The relief is mentioned by Winckelmann 1767 (1821), 11, p. 121 ('nel cortile del palazzo Caucci presso la Chiesa Nuova') but the author concentrates on the relief in the palazzo Lancellotti (see this sketchbook, f. 2ir, and Yale Sketchbook, f. 55r). In comparison to the long and narrow composition of the Palazzo Lancellotti relief, that derives from a sarcophagus lid (f. 2ir), the present relief was a sarcophagus front and consequently accommodated taller, but fewer figures. Flaxman reproduces the entire composition. It starts on the right-hand side with The Presentation of the Wedding Gifts to Creusa. The three scenes on the right, in terms of their content already familiar from f. 2ir, are more compressed. The present drawing shows again Flaxman's lack of interest in figures that are secondary to the narrative (for example, the spear holder and an additional attendant next to Jason in The Death of Creusa). The direct sequence of two relatively similar reliefs of the same subject matter also indicate Flaxman's antiquarian interests. See this sketchbook, f. 2ir, and Yale Sketchbook, f. 55r (for a complete discussion of the Lancellotti relief). //f. 23V [unused] Countryside in Central Italy //f. 24r (Fig- 22) after life Women washing at a washing pool beneath an unidentified hill town Graphite Lit.: Bindman 1979, pp. 80-81, cat. no. 85 Although Flaxman professed in a letter to William Hayley of 28 May 1794 (Pierpont Morgan Library, New York) that he was a sculptor and not a landscape painter, a small number of topographical views by him survive, including this one of a washing pool outside an unidentified village or town. Flaxman drew first the architecture and landscape with clear emphasis on the first. He then sketched a number of women into the foreground who are engaging in appropriate activities. //f. 24V [unused] Siena, Baptistery (font) //f. 25r (Fig. 23) as after Lorenzo Ghiberti [Donatello] 297</page><page sequence="301">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 The Presentation of St. John the Baptist's Head to Herod Graphite Inscribed in graphite: Lorenz Ghiberti S' John's Bapt Sienna Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280 Like Pisa, Lucca, and Orvieto, Siena was a stopping place on the way to Rome, but not to be visited in its own right. As discussed by Löseries (1998, pp. 129-36), eighteenth-century Grand Tourists would generally mention Beccafumi's and Bernini's works, and the Three Graces in the cathedral as well as the Fonte Gaia in the Campo, but otherwise ignore or criticize the medieval monuments. An early exception was Wright (1730, p. 371) who discussed the architecture of the cathedral in positive terms. Closer to Flaxman was Jean Baptiste Louis Georges Séroux ďAgincourt, who visited the town in 1777 and studied its medieval heritage (Löseries 1998, p. 141). Next to him, Flaxman was one of the very first to look more closely at the medieval and early renaissance works of sculpture and painting in and around the cathedral (Löseries 1998, p. 136). The reliefs for the Baptistery font below the east end of the cathedral were made between 141 7 and 1431. Ghiberti was apparently in charge of the overall design of the font, but the individual panels were from the beginning commissioned from different artists including Jacopo della Quercia, Ghiberti and Donatello. The commission of the present panel, originally given to della Quercia, was in 1423 transferred to Donatello (bronze, 60x61 cm, 1423 to 1427, Pope-Hennessy 1RS 1971, pp. 17-18, 257-58, pl. 17; Krautheimer 1970, il, fig. 59). His relief differs from Ghiberti's St. John before Herod on the same monument (see f. 26r) in its use of rilievo schiacciato which may have inspired later reliefs by Flaxman such as the recently rediscovered Adoration of the Magi (Bindman 2005; Trusted 2008, p. 25, n. 9; Tritz and Kessler 2009, esp. pp. 64-75). In comparison, Ghiberti's figures are modelled as individual entities against a neutral relief ground. Flaxman reproduces only the figures of the foreground strip, omitting the upper part of the relief with its secondary background characters, and any references to the architecture. He chooses a viewpoint from the left which prioritizes the act of the presentation of the head to the terrified Herod. To draw the figures of Salome and the apprehensive courtiers he assumed a different viewpoint slightly to the right, and the change of position might explain his struggle with the figure of Herodias, seated behind the table, who links the two groups. //f. 25V [unused] / /f. 26t (Fig. 24) after Lorenzo Ghiberti at Siena Cathedral Baptistery St. John before Herod Graphite / chalk? Inscribed in graphite: Lorenz Ghiberti / Sienna Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280 The second relief panel from the Siena font that Flaxman drew is the only one that was designed and executed by Ghiberti (bronze, 62 x 60 cm, 1417-27; Pope-Hennessy IGS 1972, pp. 209, 211, pl. 84; Krautheimer 1970, I, pp. 143-44 and passim , 11, pl. 72). The Baptist is shown preaching before Herod who, incited by his wife Herodias, sends him to prison. Again, Flaxman omits the architecture and focuses solely on the figures. He shows himself fully aware of the stylistic differences between this and the preceding work. High levels of relief are indicated through emphatic shading (possibly using chalk). The entire sketch is relatively swiftly drawn; on the left Flaxman starts off in his rather hesitant manner, but as he proceeds towards the right his strokes get bolder and more confident. A separate sketch on the right-hand side shows Flaxman revisiting the last few figures on the right, consisting of the Baptist and two soldiers who arrest him. Ghiberti's composition requires the beholder to imagine complex movements that will follow what is actually shown. The Baptist, who is shown addressing Herod, will be forced to turn around and to leave towards the right. Flaxman's alternative design simplifies the narrative and heightens the drama as the two soldiers appear to be dragging the Baptist out of the room as he is still addressing Herod. 298</page><page sequence="302">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 Lucca, Cathedral / Duomo //f. 2óv after thirteenth-century architecture (not reproduced) Sketch of the left portal in the west façade Graphite The small and extremely rudimentary sketch on this verso relates to f. 27r.

The Deposition by Nicola Pisano in the lunette above the left-hand entrance of the Cathedral of S. Martino at Lucca is one of the few documented works by this artist (1258; Fasola 1 941, pl. 130). Flaxman renders the figure composition evenly throughout. The figures are only rendered through outlines and shading is only used to describe the even background. Flaxman achieves it in graphite through bold parallel hatching.

Flaxman went twice to Carrara to acquire marble, in 1791, for the block of The Fury of Athamas , and the second time in summer 1794, for the Mansfield monument. In both cases he is likely to have visited Pisa. The present drawing dates most likely from the 1791 visit. In addition to the studies in the Campo Santo (ff. 28r, 29r), Flaxman made sketches after the cathedral's oldest set of bronze doors (ff. 37r and 68r). Whether the four drawings date all from the same visit cannot be established, their great distance from one another in this sketchbook could suggest otherwise. In his Lectures Flaxman would later praise Pisa in the highest terms (Flaxman 1829, pp. 300, 304-05). Confronted with the vast, complex and non-classical composition of The Last Judgement in the Campo Santo, Flaxman solely picked out the group of angels that appear in a zone of divine calm between the blessed and the damned, floating on a cloud below the appearance of Christ and the Virgin in Glory and above the archangel Michael (Meiss 1983, fig. 39, as Traini; Thomas in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, xxiv, 24, p. 860; Baracchini and Castelnuovo 1996, pl. 60, as Buonamico Buffalmacco). The symmetrical design of the group 299</page><page sequence="303">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 must have attracted Flaxman's attention and he may also have been fascinated by it as a significant Christian motif: a standing angel, his arms raised, is flanked by two trumpeting angels who direct their instruments down- wards towards the right and the left. Seated before them appears a fourth angel in profile to right, who gazes contemplatively at the beholder as he rests his chin in his hand. In a second drawing on the right, Flaxman concentrates solely on him. This drawing is developed to a higher degree of finish than the outline sketch of the overall group. //f. 28v [unused] //f. 29r (Fig. 27) as after Orcagna [Buffalmacco? / Francesco Traini? / The Master of the Triumph of Death?] The Triumph of Death, det.: five lepers Graphite Inscribed in graphite: Campo Santo Pisa Orgagna [sic] Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280 For a discussion of the reception of Pisa, see f. 28r. above. From the large fresco of The Triumph of Death, Flaxman only draws a small group of five figures (Meiss 1983, fig. 37; Thomas in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, xxiv, p. 860). Depicted largely in profile these figures with their outraged faces would lend themselves particularly well as models for outline drawings where they could be used in scenes of despair or outrage. //f. 29V [unused] Florence, Church of San Lorenzo (north pulpit) //f. 30r (Fig. 28) after Donatello The Entombment Graphite Inscribed in black ink, 1. r.: Florence Inscribed in graphite, 1. r.: Donatello S. Lorenz[ o]. Lit.: Whinney 1956, pp. 277, 280, pl. 56, fig. a Donatello 's pulpits in San Lorenzo (c. 1460-66) were left unfinished at the time of the sculptor's death and apparently not permanently erected in the church of San Lorenzo before 1558 and 1565 respectively. Their present appearance and location goes back to the early seventeenth century (1619-37; Pope-Hennessy 1RS 1971, pp. 20-22, 266-88, fig. 35; Janson 1963, pp. 209-18, pls. 102-10, esp. 109). They were well known to the Grand Tourists and discussed, for example, by Lalande 1769, 11, p. 314, and Martyn 1787, p. 322. The scenes of the north pulpit depict the Passion of Christ, the south pulpit starts with The Maries at the Sepulchre and terminates with The Ascension. Flaxman made four drawings after individual reliefs of both pulpits and a small sketch of one of them. Later in his Royal Academy Lectures he would refer to them as important achievements of their period and see the influence of Byzantine ('Greek Christian') art expressed in the scenes (Flaxman 1829, pp. 169, 309). The Entombment decorates the short side of the north pulpit that is facing the altar. It is a crowded low relief. Flaxman's study is a drastic reduction of the design. He only records the figure composition in the roughest outlines with hesitantly drawn, long and largely continuous lines. See this sketchbook, ff. 3ir, 62r, 65r; Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 39-42; Flaxman 1829, pp. 169, 309. //f. 30V [unused] Florence, Church of San Lorenzo (south pulpit) //€. 3ir (Fig. 29) after Donatello The Descent Into Limbo 300</page><page sequence="304">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 Graphite Inscribed in black ink, 1. r.: Florence Inscribed in graphite, 1. r.: Donatello S.

Flaxman does not produce as neat an outline drawing as that of The Entombment (f. 3 or); the individual lines are shorter and more tentatively placed. Multiple and/ or slightly blurred outlines may indicate a greater struggle in front of the more complex original, but they may also be read as deliberate techniques, used to suggest varying levels of relief. //f. 3IV [unused] Florence, Baptistery (North Doors) //f. 32r (Fig- 30) after Lorenzo Ghiberti Christ among the Doctors Graphite Inscribed in graphite, 1. r.: Ghiberti baptistery Inscribed in black ink, 1. r.: Sienna Florence Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280; Irwin 1979, p. 137, fig. 186 This scene is the fourth from the left in the third tier from the bottom of Ghiberti's North Doors which Flaxman studied extensively during his first stay in Florence in November 1787 (Krautheimer 1970, 11, pls. 30 and 31). The drawing differs from the earlier set of studies in that there is no indication of the shape of the picture field. As elsewhere in this sketchbook, Flaxman largely omits the architectural setting. The comparison with the earlier drawings also reveals the change in technique from the early, carefully built-up drawings in thin graphite, pen and ink and wash to the bolder and much more economic graphite drawing. Elements of the composition are echoed in Flaxman's monument to Abraham Balme, 1809-12, Bradford Cathedral (Irwin 1979, p. 137, fig. 185). See Yale Sketchbook, ff. ir, jr (for a discussion of the North Doors and Flaxman's reception of them), 8r, 9r, I7r, i8r, 2ir, 22r; Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 4r.; Ottley Album, Cat. nos. 25-27. //f. 32V [unused] //f. 33r [unused] //f. 33V [unused] Florence, San Lorenzo (Old Sacristy) //{. 34r (Fig. 31) after Brunelleschi The Sacrifice of Abraham, det.: upper half of composition Graphite Inscribed in graphite, 1. r.: Bruneleschi [sic] S.t Lorenzo Florence Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280 This is Brunelleschi's unsuccessful competition relief for the commission of the North Doors of the Florentine Baptistery (Krautheimer 1970, pp. 31-49, fig. 1; Pope-Hennessy 1RS 1971, pp. 1-2, 246-47, fig. 2). In the eighteenth century it was kept in the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo that, like the church itself, was also designed by Brunelleschi. It is now in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello. Flaxman splits Brunelleschi's image horizon- tally into two separate drawings of which the second is located on f. 35r. In doing this, Flaxman partly bows to circumstances, namely the oblong format of the sketchbook, but the decision is also a response to the weakness of Brunelleschi's composition, that lacks overall coherence. Flaxman does, though, indicate with thin and faint 301</page><page sequence="305">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 lines either side of the images the quatrefoil shape of the panel. The present study shows the upper half with the main scene of the sacrifice. //f. 34V [unused] //f. 35r (Fig. 32) after Brunelleschi The Sacrifice of Abraham, det.: lower half of composition Graphite Inscribed in graphite, 1. 1.: Bruneleschi [sic] S.t Lorenzo ; Inscribed in black ink, 1. 1.: Florence Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280 After the sketch of the upper and main part ofBrunelleschi's competition relief for the commission of the North Doors of Florence Baptistery (f. 33r), Flaxman made this study of the lower part, depicting the two waiting servants with the donkey. Beyond the aim of recording the full composition, when copying this section Flaxman will have been interested in the complex anatomical poses of the figures and their references to classical models such as the Spinario (cf. Penny and Haskell 1981, pp. 308-10). //f. 35V [unused] Siena, Cathedral / Duomo //f. 3ór (Fig- 33) after Nicola Pisano Three designs after the pulpit Graphite Inscribed in graphite, u. 1.: Pulpit of Cathedral, Sienna Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 280 1) (1.)

Flaxman made an additional study after a detail of one of the reliefs (f. 6ir), though its position in the sketchbook suggests that it dates from a later visit to Siena. See this sketchbook, f. 6ir; Flaxman 1829, p. 307. //f. 36V [unused] Pisa, Cathedral / Duomo (Portal of S.

A scene based on The Raising of Lazarus Graphite and pen and ink Inscribed in black ink, below prostration scene: Pisa 2) (r.) The Transfiguration Graphite Whinney identified three scenes on this folio, on the left-hand side Adam and Eve before God after an unidentified source, in the centre an unidentified scene and on the right-hand side a faint sketch of Bonanno's Transfiguration from the Portal of St. Ranieri. The Transfiguration from that portal appears a second time on 302</page><page sequence="306">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 f. 68r together with The Raising of Lazarus from the same set of doors (see f. 68r for information on the doors). Both drawings on that folio are typical of Flaxman in terms of the closeness to original models. The present drawing of The Transfiguration on the other hand is much more loosely related to the original; Christ is no longer in the elevated position, indeed one might wonder whether Moses and Elijah are not supposed to be floating next to him, and the three apostles who accompanied Christ onto Mount Tabor are also closer to one another than in the relief. Once one accepts that the drawings on the present folio may not be close copies, it becomes apparent that there are also compositional similarities between Bonanno's The Raising of Lazarus and the central scene in the present drawing. In both designs Christ is standing on raised ground gesticulating towards a kneeling couple below and in front of him; both involve a tomb. Pentimenti in the present drawing confirm its dependence on the bronze panel. At some stage the kneeling figures had been sketched as they appear in the relief and there is a faint outline of the head of Christ above them, now overlapped by the second tomb support from the right. Thus the drawings on this sheet seem to take the original compositions as their starting point, rather than recording them. The Transfiguration Flaxman did not take any further, but he developed The Raising of Lazarus into a modern rendering of this subject matter in a style that reminds one of his own work, for example, the relief of The Adoration of the Magi (Bindman 2005; Tritz and Kessler 2009, esp. pp. 64-75). The two figures on the right are part of this new composition; they are mourners of Lazarus (see p. 32). //f. 37V [unused] Rome, Villa Albani (now Museo Torlonia) //{. 38r (Fig. 35) after ancient relief frieze ( Torlonia Vase) A Bacchic symposium, det.

It was first studied by Amico Aspertini in the early sixteenth century in either S. Cecilia or S. Francesco in Trastevere (Codex Wolfegg, ff. 43v~44r; Schweikhart 1986, pp. 101-03, fig- 27' als° Leoncini 1991, pp. 100-01) and was then transferred from 1530 until the early eighteenth century into the Cesi Gardens. Sold to the Albani family in the early eighteenth century, it entered the Villa Albani in c. 1760 and is now in the Museo Torlonia (Bober and Rubinstein 1986, p. 124). From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century the vase was hugely famous and frequently copied (see the catalogue of drawings, engravings and adaptations of the vase in Leoncini 1991, pp. 108-16; the list includes four eighteenth-century prints by Piranesi, Gounod and Piroli but not the present drawings (Leoncini 1991, p. 115). For a complete description of the vase, see Leoncini 1991, pp. 107-08. Like many other draughtsmen before him, Flaxman only copies sections of the figure frieze. The present drawing represents Hercules (on the right) reclining next to a satyr who has his head buried in a crater with wine and is held by a reclining maenad on the left who is holding a thyrsus: next to her is another reclining male figure. //f. 38V [unused] //{. 39r (Fig. 36) after ancient relief frieze ( Torlonia Vase) A Bacchic symposium, det.

The Borghese relief bears the inscriptions ZETHVS , ANTIOPE and AMPHION and Winckelmann follows this interpretation of the represented scene. He does, though, also mention the Greek inscriptions on a third copy in Naples that identify the figures as Eurydice, Orpheus and Hermes. Winckelmann's conclusion from this evidence was that in antiquity the same image could be identified in different ways by different people. It was only in the nineteenth century that the inscriptions in the Borghese relief were identified as modern additions (Bol 1989-2003, as above, p. 452). Flaxman mentions the Neapolitan relief in the UCL Journal (f. 2ór). We have no evidence which of the two readings Flaxman adhered to, but there can be no doubt that the general sentiment of this quiet and intimate scene appealed to him. //f. 41 v [unused] Rome, S.

Given that the church was a Constan- tinian foundation, Flaxman may have assumed such an early date for the cloisters too; indeed, the decoration is extremely classicizing. With his typical economy, Flaxman copies a single lion head and one palmette. The curved line to the left of the lion mask, easily misread as the end of the frieze, represents the profile of 304</page><page sequence="308">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 this concave cornice. This technical detail suggests that Flaxman may have noted the motif also with future sculpture commissions in mind. See UCL Journal, Cat. no. 27 (for a study after a similar architectural detail of ancient origin). 2) (1. 1.) Female figure crouching The twisted pose of this figure is difficult to read, the knees seem to be facing the beholder while the upper body appears in profile, if not turned away from the beholder.

Flaxman's drawing is evenly worked up to a relatively high degree of finish and it is possibly that he made it in preparation for a drawing of 'two female figures' to be sold to Edward Knight (Yale Sketchbook, f. 8ov). //f. 42V [unused] Pisa, Campo Santo and Orvieto, Cathedral / Duomo /f. 43r (Fig. 39) William Young Ottley as after Orcagna [Francesco Traini ?] and after Nicola Pisano [style of Maitani] Two studies after painting and sculpture Pen and [brown] ink Inscribed in brown ink, in Flaxman's hand, 1. r.: M:r Ottley Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281 As part of an artistic exchange in Rome, Flaxman let William Young Ottley copy two of his drawings after Ghiberti from the Yale Sketchbook (ff. 8r and i8r; Ottley collection, Cat. nos 26 and 27). In return, Ottley copied three drawings of his own into the present sketchbook, using this folio and f. 45r. This scenario appears more straightforward than the traditional assumption that Ottley's drawings in this sketchbook were made in front of the originals in Pisa and Orvieto (see, for example; Irwin 1979, p. 42). In 1792, Flaxman and Ottley travelled together to Orvieto, but, as Hugh Brigstocke points out (p. 10), we do not have any evidence that they ever coincided in Pisa. It also appears somewhat elaborate to assume that on two different occasions Flaxman lent a sketchbook he was using himself, to a travel companion, only for this artist to make an additional copy for his own use. See p. 10 for Ottley and Flaxman; this sketchbook, ff. 28r, 29r, 37r, 69r for Flaxman's drawings in Pisa; f. 48, for his study of a motif inside the cathedral in Orvieto; Bindman 1979, p. 79, cat. no. 83 for a separate study by Flaxman of a motif from the façade. 1) (1.) Angel from the Crucifixion Inscribed in brown ink, not in Flaxman's hand, 1. 1.: in the crucifixion. Campo Santo Pisa In the Campo Santo at Pisa, Ottley, like Flaxman on ff. 28r and 29r, picked out only a single motif from one of the vast frescoes in the south corridor. The highly symmetrically composed mourning angel appeared on the right-hand side between Christ and the bad sinner (1330s; Caleca in Baracchini and Castelnuovo 1996, pp. 21-22, fig. 43). Ottley draws exclusively in pen and ink and uses extensive parallel and cross-hatching for shading and tonal modelling - a design technique that could be easily followed by an engraver. Ottley 305</page><page sequence="309">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 collection, Cat. no. 79 consists of five angels from The Crucifixion. The present drawing is a close copy of it. It is close in terms of the representation of the original fresco but there is no attempt to record, e.g. the exact pattern of hatching in the Ottley drawing. 2) (r.) Noli me tangere Inscribed in brown ink, not in Flaxman's hand, 1. r.: on the front of the Duomo, Orvieto. Ottley copied the Noli me Tangere from high up among the scenes from the life of Christ. This cycle is depicted in the relief between the central and the south portal of the façade of Orvieto Cathedral (marble, between 1310-30, Pope-Hennessy IGS 1972, pp. 19-21, 188-89, figs- 3°&gt; 35; Middeldorf-Kosegarten 1996, pp. 29-36, 49, fig. 27). Scrolling branches subdivide the relief and one such branch forms the margin of the present scene. The figure of Mary Magdalene is copied very closely, while the slender and elegant figure of Christ has been turned into a positively Herculean body. See this sketchbook, f. 4$r; Irwin 1966, pp. 72, 89; Bindman 1979, p. 79, cat. no. 83 (for a separate drawing by Flaxman after Maitani's Last Judgement from Orvieto façade at the British Museum); Flaxman 1829, pp. 169, 246, 307.

Minerva CLXXXIH; Venturi 1893, pp. 41-42; Staccioli and Moreno 1981, pp. 87, 101). The goddess wears the aegis diagonally across her upper body, her shield with the Gorgoneion stands to her side with snakes winding around it. Flaxman omits the modern restorations of the arms and head, all easily distinguishable. These omissions certainly reflect his concern with antiquarian issues, but they may have been primarily motivated by his interest in the figure's drapery and attribute. Flaxman follows this design closely in his relief figure of Britannia for the monument of Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford, Wroxton, Oxon; Whinney and Gunnis 1967, p. 23, no. 28. 4) Unidentified sculpture of a female figure striding forward, without head and arms; in profile to right 5) The same sculpture, frontal view This unidentified sculpture shows a female figure in a chiton striding forward, her body registered through the thin drapery; it is possibly a Venus or Victory. Flaxman may have looked at a fragmentary sculpture or omitted modern restorations as in the other sketches on this folio. //f. 44V [unused] Orvieto, Cathedral / Duomo //f. 45r (Fig. 41) William Young Ottley after Maitani Adam and Eve hiding from God pen and [brown] ink 306</page><page sequence="310">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 Inscribed in brown ink, 1. r., not in Flaxman's hand: on the outside of the Duomo, Orvieto Inscribed in brown ink, 1. r., in Flaxman's hand: Mr. Ottley Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281; Irwin 1979, p. 42, fig. 50 This third drawing by Ottley depicts another scene from the reliefs that adorn the façade of Orvieto Cathedral, this time from the scenes from the book of Genesis , to the left of the north portal (marble, between 1310-30, Pope-Hennessy IGS 1972, pp. 19-21, 188-89, figs. 30, 33; Middeldorf-Kosegarten 1996, pp. 29-36, 61-64, fig. 42; for other drawings by Ottley, see this sketchbook, f. 43 r). In contrast to most of Flaxman's designs after other artists, Ottley's drawing has strong tonal contrasts and is evenly finished. Here, the artist appears also less sensitive to the figure style of the original and not as close to the original in the rendering of drapery and the general proportions of the image. See this sketchbook, f. 48r for Flaxman's drawing of motif inside Orvieto Cathedral; Irwin 1966, pp. 72, 89, and Bindman 1979, p. 79, cat. no. 83, for a separate drawing now at the British Museum, by Flaxman after Maitani's Last Judgement from the façade of the cathedral; Flaxman 1829, pp. 169, 307 (on the reliefs of the façade in Orvieto).

Rome, Villa Mattei //{£. 45V and 46r (Fig. 42) after ancient sarcophagus relief Diana and Ceres fighting giants Graphite Inscribed in black ink on f. 46V: Villa Mattei Lit.: Irwin 1979, p. 80, fig. 101 The relief shows Artemis on the left and Minerva at the centre fighting three giants, one of whom is half-man half-snake. Since 1613 it decorated the Fontana delle Colonne in the Villa Mattei. It was bought by Pius VII on 4 January 1802 and is now in the Cortile Ottagono in the Vatican (Andreae 1995-98, 11 (1998), no. 38, pls. 214-15, p. 19*). In the eighteenth century it was reproduced in Venuti and Amaduzzi 1779, m, pl. 19,1. Flaxman draws the complete relief, including also additions by modern restorers that have since been removed. These are Artemis's right arm and the left arm of the giant next to her. He develops the human figures in the composition to an even, relatively high level of finish and only indicates the trees that appear in low relief behind and in between the figures. The composition is echoed in Flaxman's own design The Fight for the Body ofPatroclus (Flaxman, Iliad , 1870, pl. 26; also reproduced in Irwin 1979, p. 80, fig. 100). //f. 46V [inscribed as mentioned above] Rome, Palazzo Lancellotti //f. 47* (Fig. 43) after ancient sarcophagus relief The Birth of Venus, det., Nereid and Seamonster Graphite Inscribed in black ink, 1. c.: Palace Lancellotti On this folio Flaxman set out to draw the larger part of a relief of The Birth of Venus (47 x 184 cm, Rumpf in ASR, v (1939), p. 36, no. 91, pl. 36). Documented through drawings since the mid-sixteenth century, the sarcophagus was inserted into the walls of the courtyard of the Palazzo Lancellotti (built around 1600) from where it was sold to the Pope in 1807 or 1808. It is now in the Lateran (Cavazzini 1998, p. 30). The relief was regularly copied during the sixteenth century. It appears in the Codex Coburgensis (before 1555, Matz 1871, p. 488, no. 174), Codex Pighianus (1547-55; Jahn 1868, 186, f. 364), and the collection of Cassiano dal Pozzo (before 1657; Windsor, vi, f. 41, no. 8601; Vermeule 1966, p. 41; also reproduced in Cavazzini 1998, p. 31). Flaxman laid out his drawing with very faint, now nearly illegible, lines apparently planning to include the entire left-hand side of the composition, including nereids and sea creatures and the central shell with Venus at her toilet. Given the nearly symmetrical composition of the relief this would have given him an almost 307</page><page sequence="311">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 complete record of the work. He then worked up the first group on the very left; a nereid who embraces a sea monster that is half-bull half-fish. A winged putto with a lyre and another small sea creature appear next to them. The sketch includes a number of modern additions, such as the nereid's left foot and the entire left-hand margin, including the front leg of the sea bull and the nereiďs hand. These additions can also be found in the earlier drawings but have since been removed from the relief. //f. 47V [unused] Orvieto, Cathedral (Cappella di S. Brizio) //f. 48r (Fig- 44) after Signorelli and architectural plan Two studies from the Cappella di S. Brizio Graphite Inscribed in black ink, u. r.: Cathedral Orvietto [sic] Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281; Irwin 1979, p. 41, fig. 48 In 1792 Flaxman and William Young Ottley went together for two weeks to Orvieto (p. 10). It may have been during this visit that Flaxman made the present drawings. 1) (1.) Nudes in Combat In this drawing Flaxman copies a scene from the socle zone of Signorelli's decoration of the Cappella di S. Brizio or Cappella Nuova, directly underneath the Resurrection of the Flesh (fresco, 1499-1504; Henry in Henry and Kanter 2001, pp. 199-205, esp. 201 and pl. 58/11). The subject matter has not been identified and it is unlikely that Flaxman was able to identify the scene. The round grisaille composition with a group of men in combat provided Flaxman with a small, self-contained example of Signorelli's work that also suited his own style. The figures stand on a horizontal ground strip and their poses and actions are fitted neatly into the curved upper margin of the picture field. Thus, Flaxman found a composition that formed a gentle curve with the impulse of movement developing from the bottom left via the top centre back down to the right. For a similar composition, see Flaxman's vignette-like study after a detail from the Last Judgement of Nicola Pisano's Siena pulpit, f. 6ir. Flaxman executed the drawing with broad outlines and used tonal modelling to suggest the volume that characterizes Signorelli's heroic nudes. 2) (r.) Groundplan of the Cappella di S. Brizio On the bottom right-hand side Flaxman drew with faint strokes of graphite a simple groundplan of the chapel, indicating the entrance on the right, the altar on the left and the benches that line the walls. See Flaxman 1829, p. 189. //f. 48V [unused] Rome, Villa Borghese //f. 4í&gt;r (Fig. 45) after ancient Roman altar Four studies of an astrological altar/base of a marble candelabrum Graphite Inscribed in black ink, 1. r.: Villa Burghese [sic] 1) (1.)

Groundplan of the pedestal This base of a Roman candelabrum with astrological images was previously taken for an altar. It is decorated with reliefs of Ceres in the Sign of Virgo, Jupiter in the Sign of Sagitaire and Mars in the Sign of Scorpio . As noted by 308</page><page sequence="312">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 Flaxman, during the eighteenth century it was in the Villa Borghese, but now it is in the Louvre where it is kept in storage (marble, height 101 cm, height of figures 60 cm, Augustan, inv. no. MA 610; Clara c 1826-53, li, i (1841), pp. 186-91, nos. 20-22, pis 130, 151, 201; Cain 1985, pp. 170-71, cat. no. 62). Winckelmann (1767 (1821), pp. 11-13, n. 11) interpreted the object as an altar. He, too, focused on the relief of Jupiter but records the loss of the centaur's face, which Flaxman restores in his drawing. Winckelmann interprets the scene as a representation of Jupiter as Hunter. Flaxman draws first the relief of Jupiter in the Sign of Sagitaire indicating the full trapezoidal picture field. This is omitted in his study of Ceres in the Sign of Virgo which also appears in the elevation of the base in drawing 3). Finally the drawing of the pedestal on which the entire base is resting provides the information that this object is triangular in plan. //f. 49V [unused] //f. sor (Fig. 46) after an ancient base of a tripod (Altar of the Twelve Gods) Relief with Mars, Venus, Mercury and Vesta, det.: Mercury and Venus Graphite Flaxman sketches the outlines of Mercury and the figures next to him from one of the reliefs of the triangular base in the Borghese Collection, known as the Altar of the Twelve Gods. Since the early nineteenth century it has been in the Louvre (marble, height 180 cm; Fröhner 1869, no. 1, pp. 3-9; Clara c 1826-53, 11, 1 (1841), pp. 170-82, esp. 173-76, pls. 172-74; esp. 174, 14 (for this relief). The altar is first documented through a drawing in the Codex Coburgensis (before 1555; Matz 1871, p. 472, no. 69). Other drawings include Codex Pighianus (1547-55; Jahn 1868, pp. 198-200, no. 93, pl. 5); and Dosio (late sixteenth to early seventeenth century; Hülsen 1933, pp. 19-20, f. 32V, pl. 46, fig. 88). It was discussed by Winckelmann (1764 (2006), pp. 162-63, 168-69, !73 and idem , 1767 (1821), p. 14, n. 15) who referred to it as an Etruscan altar. There is enough space on this folio to suggest that Flaxman intended to make a set of drawings similar to those for the base on f. 49r. In the end he only started a drawing of one of the side reliefs and of this he only rendered the figures of Mercury, Venus (on the left) and Vesta (on the right) and Venus, omitting even that of Mars to the left of Venus. //f. 50V [unused] Rome, Palazzo Lancellotti //f. 5ir (Fig. 47) after ancient sarcophagus relief The Marriage of Neptune and Amphitrite Graphite and pen and ink Inscribed in black ink on verso: Palace Lancellotti An earlier sketch after this relief can be found in the Yale Sketchbook (f. 5ir, also for the relief and Flaxman's reception of it). The present drawing is unusual in terms of its medium and technique as Flaxman uses only graphite and pen and ink. The relief ground is indicated through shading which is achieved exclusively through parallel hatching in pen and ink. This purely linear technique can also be found in the following drawing. //f. 5IV [unused] Rome, Church of S.

Maria sopra Minerva. In the second half of the sixteenth century this sarcophagus relief was transferred to the church. There it was 309</page><page sequence="313">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 inserted into the late fifteenth-century tomb of Giovanni Arberini that is positioned in the second chapel to the left of the choir. Flaxman studied the relief in a first drawing during his initial stay in Rome (Y ale Sketchbook, f. 74r). In contrast to the earlier drawing, the present one is brought to a higher degree of finish. Flaxman omits the left end of the sarcophagus, which is decorated with a bull's head identical to the one on the right. See Yale Sketchbook, f. 74r (for the relief and its history). //f. 52V [unused] Rome, Villa Medici (garden façade) //f. 53* (Fig- 49) after ancient sarcophagus relief The Judgement of Paris Graphite This is Flaxman's second attempt to draw the complex composition of the badly damaged Judgement of Paris from the garden façade of the Villa Medici; for the earlier drawing, see this sketchbook, f. i8r. The present sketch indicates the margins of the picture field and the outlines of the two central figures of Venus and an armed hero whom Robert (in ASR, 11 (1990), p. 17) identifies as Paris after the judgement. Flaxman's drawing does not record any of the ample damages to the relief, representing, for example both figures with their heads intact. Still, it is testimony to his characteristic accuracy that even at this rudimentary stage the source of his drawing remains identifiable. See this sketchbook, f. i8r, and Yale Sketchbook, f. 36r, for a drawing after another sarcophagus of the same subject matter. //f. 53v [unused] Florence, Church of S.

Abraham and the Three Angels 2) (r.) The Dream of Abraham The frescos are now badly damaged and photographic reproductions are unobtainable. Based on Vasari's account, these scenes are generally ascribed to Dello Delli who would have painted them before he left for Spain in 1433 (Pope-Hennessy 1969, p. 163; Paoletti in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, vm, pp. 683-84). Flaxman isolates the two scenes from the rest of the frescos and works them up to a high and even standard. //f. 54V [unused] Rome, Villa Borghese (west façade) //f. 55r (Fig. 51) after ancient sarcophagus relief The Fall of Phaeton Graphite and pen and ink This relief was from 1615 to 1808 inserted into the west façade of the Villa Borghese, directly above the portico. Since 1808 it has been in the Louvre (112 x 242 cm, third century ad; Robert in ASR, hi, 3 (1919), pp. 418-20, cat. no. 337). During the Renaissance, the relief was copied in the Codex Coburgensis (before 310</page><page sequence="314">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 1555; Matz 1871, p. 487, no. 159, f. 209) and a drawing from the collection of Cassiano dal Pozzo (before 1657; British Museum, f. 67, no. 74; Vermeule i960, p. 14). Another drawing of it was in Richard Topham's collec- tion (before 1730; Tophamianus Eton BM I, f. 20 (Ciferri)). It is several times mentioned in the eighteenth century. Winckelmann (1767 (1821), 11, pp. 51-54, n. 43) comments on the work as 'mediocre' but provides a detailed analysis of its iconography. The central scene of the Fall of Phaeton shows Phaeton tumbling down towards the river-god Eridanus while two riders, possibly the Dioscuri, come to rescue the quadriga. On the upper left-hand side is the earlier scene of Phaeton's Request ; he is shown standing before his father Phoebus. The scene on the right shows Phoebus, his arms raised in despair as the horses are out of control and, further towards the right appear Phaeton's sisters, the Heliades, as they are transformed into poplars. Flaxman may have been particularly interested in the motif of the falling body, which would have resonated with Christian images and themes of divine punishment such as The Fall of the Rebel Angels and The Last Judgment , studies for and/or after which can also be found in the present sketchbook. See Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 9V (reference to a relief of the same subject in Florence). //f. 55V [unused] //f. 56r (Fig. 52) after ancient sarcophagus relief The Discovery of Achilles in Arcadia Graphite, pen and ink, and wash Inscribed in black ink on verso: Villa Burghese [sic] This is another sarcophagus front that was built into the west façade of the Villa Borghese in 1615 and moved to the Louvre in 1808 (120 x 288 cm, second century ad, Neo-Attic, inv. no. Ma 2120; Rogge in ASR, ix, 1, i (1995), p. 134, no. 21, pl. 48). Winckelmann (1767 (1821), 11, p. 167, no. 124) identified the work as a representation of Achilles' outrage against Agamemnon for taking away his lover Briseis. In the record of a commission from Mr Knight in the Yale Sketchbook (f. 8ov), Flaxman mentions a drawing after The Discovery of Achilles which may have been based on the present drawing. This may be taken as evidence that he recognized the subject matter of the work. Achilles is shown surrounded by the daughters of Lykomedes amongst whom he had hidden. He has already taken up his arms in excitement and dropped his female disguise. On the right-hand side sits Agamemnon; opposite him on the left sits Lykomedes, whose head is close to that of Ulysses. Flaxman's drawing is lacking in detail, but is carefully executed and captures the fluidity of the composition of this relief as well as the elegance and crispness of the individual figures. Studying the relief from steeply below, Flaxman misreads the head of one of the daughters of Hippolytus to the right of Achilles' shield as the head of a horse and he misses the rapport between the head of Ulysses and the seated figure of Lykomedes. In Flaxman's drawing Ulysses and the heads of the horses are confined to the background, reflecting Flaxman's concern about the legibility of the frieze. //f. 56V [unused] Buonconvento, Inn //f. 571 (Fig. 53) as after Spinello Aretino [fifteenth-century Sienese?] The Madonna della Misericordia flanked by the Angel (left) and Virgin (right) of the Annunciation Graphite Inscribed in black ink, u. r.: At the Inn Buon Convento / [in graphite:] Spinello Aretino Lit.: Constable 1927, p. 29; Whinney 1956, p. 281 Buonconvento, between Florence and Siena, was an important changing point for horses and carriages and features in numerous travel guides in this capacity (e.g. Lalande 1769, 11, p. 623). Flaxman's inscription on this 311</page><page sequence="315">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 and the subsequent folio (f. 581:) suggest that he was copying from paintings, given his attribution of the work to Spinello Aretino, a painter. Furthermore, if taken literally, the inscription would indicate that the works were associated rather with the inn than a church or chapel. This suggests that he was studying a tabernacle or a mural, and it may be assumed that the works that Flaxman studied are lost. The old inn in Buonconvento has been replaced by a neo-classical building and all houses have been stripped of their original external plaster (I am indebted to Matthias Quast, Spoleto, for this information). In this drawing, Flaxman represents the Madonna della Misericordia standing upright and holding her mantle open to shelter two groups of kneeling believers. Either side of this group appear the Angel of the Annnciation and the Virgin Annunciate. Constable's (1927, 29; Museo Statale 1987, p. 59, no. 21) identification of the image as Parri Spinelli's Madonna della Misericordia (1437) in Arezzo can be dismissed on grounds of the visual evidence and known provenance of that work. //f. 57V [unused] //f. 58r (Fig. 54) after unidentified late fifteenth-/ early sixteenth-century artist Three studies after a lost painting (?)

Study 1 depicts the head of a contemporary young nobleman, apparently a saint, and next to it Flaxman drew two studies of a hand holding an orb that is surmounted by a cross. The upper drawing was apparently aborted, as the second is partly drawn over it. If head and hand belong together, this would make the figure a holy king. Flaxman seems to have been struck by the grace of the image which he renders to a high degree of finish, creating volume through tonal modelling with washes.

Flaxman's sketchbook was rather inadequate for a study of such a vertical monument and in fact his general view omits the top and bottom ties of the tomb, including the figures of virtues who carry the sarcophagus. The latter is decorated with three relief scenes: the Noli me tangere , Resurrection and Doubting Thomas. Between these stand statues of saints. Flaxman copies the central Resurrection in a larger scale on the left-hand side but does not develop it to the same high degree of 312</page><page sequence="316">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 finish as the general view. On top of the sarcophagus is the death chamber. Deacons hold back curtains to reveal the deceased as he lies in state. Flaxman has simplified the front of the bier, removed almost all references to heraldry and changed the proportions of this section, making it taller and more prominent. Above the chamber the Virgin with Child is flanked by two saints. See the studies after The Resurrection and Noli me tangere from the della Torre tomb in S.

Flaxman drew the left-hand side and centre of the Agony in the Garden that forms the central scene of the bottom tier (13 11, White 1979, fig. 32). Flaxman shows Christ returning to the Apostles and works up only a few of the figures of his disciples, while the figure of Christ is only sketched in with faint graphite strokes. Groups of bulky seated figures shown in profile regularly caught Flaxman's attention and he included them in his own designs (for example, The Adoration of the Magi; Bindman 2005; Tritz and Kessler 2009, esp. pp. 64-75). //f. 60V [unused] //{. 6ir (Fig. 57) after Nicola Pisano The Last Judgment , det. with an angel, damned and devils Graphite, pen and ink, and wash Inscribed in black ink, 1. 1.: Nicola Pisano [change of ink and pen] Duomo Sienna Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281 Following the beautifully composed set of plans and drawings of the Siena pulpit on f. 3ór, this is a detail of the Damned from The Last Judgement (Pope-Hennessy IGS, pp. 4-5, 172, fig. 8; Moskowitz 2005, pp. 93-114, pl. 80, fig. 98; for the pulpit, see also this sketchbook, f. 3ór). Flaxman has extracted the group of figures, including a supervising angel, three devils and five of the damned from the right-hand corner of the relief panel. He omits a figure on the top right-hand side, creating thus a vignette that develops in an elegant sweep from the top left to the bottom right. The same elegance and subtlety can also be found in the execution; thin graphite lines are reinforced with pen and ink. Wash is applied to indicate areas of deeper relief as well as provide some slight tonal modelling in the graceful face of the angel.

Elevation of the pulpit Graphite Compared with the two outline sketches on ff. 3 or and 3ir, the present drawing of The Ascension and that of The Three Maries at the Tomb (f. Ó5r) are strikingly different in technique and level of finish (for the relief of the Ascension : Pope-Hennessy 1RS 1972, pp. 20-22, fig. 34, 266-68; Janson 1963, pp. 209-18, pls. 11 1-20, esp. 117, cf. also pl. 102; for a discussion of the pulpit in general, see f. 30r). Flaxman has carefully sketched out the composition in thin graphite and worked it up in pen and ink, using parallel hatching to indicate and distinguish different levels of relief. Individual figures are carefully characterized and emotional relationships between them developed through their gazes. In part, Flaxman reacts here to the different subjects and moods of the compositions. Donatello does not use dramatic gestures as in the Entombment (f. 3 or), nor does he develop a single sense of direction as in Christ in Limbo (f. 3ir). In the Ascension Christ rises gently while those who remain express their amazement through gestures of prayer. On the right-hand side Flaxman adds the elevation of one of the pulpits as an aide-memoire. See Flaxman 1829, pp. 169, 309; this sketchbook, pp. 3or, 3ir and 6sr. Florence, Church of S.

With its dramatic use of linear perspective and frequent instances of foreshortened cadavers, the fresco served the stereotypical view that this artist had singlemindedly 'brought perspective to perfection' (cited from Flaxman 1829, p. 323; fresco, c. 1440s; Pope-Hennessy 1969, pp. 145-48, pl. 31). But the lunette's complex iconography, comprising The Flood and The Recession of the Flood in one picture field, is unlikely to have appealed to Flaxman. However, as he omits several of the dramatic orthogonals in the picture, he rather reduces its legibility. See Flaxman 1829, p. 323; Brigstocke in this volume, p. 398. //f, 63V [unused] Location of source unknown //f. Ó4r (Fig. 60) after unknown sixteenth-century source / preparatory study (?)

An early seventeenth-century, probably a northern European, image of this subject or of a Last fudgement seems a likely source for the present drawings, that show contorted nude figures falling downward. Whinney 1956 suggested an unidentified mid sixteenth-century [Italian?] model. But the possibility should not be ruled out that these are studies by Flaxman for his own work and not copied from another work. //f. 64V [unused] Florence, Church of San Lorenzo (south pulpit) //f. 6$r (Fig. 61) after Donatello The Three Maries at the Tomb 314</page><page sequence="318">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 Graphite, pen and ink, and wash Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281 The fourth and last of Flaxman's drawings after the bronze pulpits in San Lorenzo renders the spatially complex scene of The Three Maries at the Tomb. Like the Entombment on the north pulpit, this relief on the south pulpit decorates the end facing the altar (Pope-Hennessy 1RS 1972, pp. 20-22, figs. 34, 266- 68; Janson 1963, pp. 209-18, pls. 1 1 1-20, esp. 117, cf. also pl. 102). Flaxman largely omits the external architecture of the scene, apart from the colonnade through which the event is viewed, and simplifies the shape of the apertures.

Flaxman made drawings of the central Resurrection and the Noli me tangere on the right, omitting the Doubting of Thomas. The drawings are brought to an even level of finish, using hatching for shading. //f. 66v [unused] Florence, Cathedral/Duomo //f. 67t (Fig. 63) after Baccio Bandinelli Six Old Testament Prophets Graphite, pen and [brown] ink, and [black] wash Lit.: Whinney 1956, p. 281 In this drawing Flaxman juxtaposes six of the Old Testament prophets each of which appear on an individual panel on Bandinelli's high altar screen in Florence Cathedral (marble, 1547-72, Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 68, 365-66, pl. 66, fig. 87; Vossilla 1997, pp. 69-109). Flaxman separates at least some of the figures from their neighbours with very faint graphite lines, indicating that they do not form a continuous frieze. All figures are evenly worked up, but Flaxman uses wash for the second figure on the right. //f. 67V [unused] Pisa, Cathedral/Duomo (Portal of S.

The door shows scenes from the life of Christ (Goetz 1971, cat. nos. 10 and 40; Melczer 1988, pp. 183-213, figs. 133 and 147; for excellent illustrations, see Peroni 1995, figs. 405 ( The Transfiguration) and 406 ( The Raising of Lazarus). The two scenes that Flaxman copies are next to one another at the centre of the doors. Flaxman records the compositions closely but simplifies and classicizes the figures. Both drawings are executed with thin, relatively faint lines that represent only the first stage of Flaxman's usual design process. In f. 37, Flaxman has taken the same two scenes as a starting point for his own compositions. The present drawing was also used as the model for the illustration of a Transfiguration in the posthumous publication of Flaxman's lectures (Flaxman 1829, pl. 36). The engraver, W. Walton, mistook Flaxman's rendering of Christ's twelfth-century hairstyle in this relief for a hood. In the lecture, Flaxman does not refer to the work specifically, but makes the point that the iconography of the Transfiguration in Italian paintings was formed by 'Greek' artists. //f. 68v [unused] Verona, Churchyard of S.

The left-hand side of the folio consists of one sketch of five Scaligeri tombs as they appear next to one another outside the church of S. Maria Antica in Verona (De Maffei 1966, pp.18- 37, pls. 1-2; David in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxxn, pp. 345-46). These are, on the left, the tomb of Mastino II (d. 135 1) and, on the right, that of Cansignorio (d. 1375). Tentative modern identifications of the three sarcophagi in between are as follows (left to right): Bartolomeo I (d. 1304), Cangrande II (d. 1359), Alboino (d. 13 11) or Bartolomeo II (d. 1381). Next to this view Flaxman drew separately a wall tomb in a niche. It depicts in simplified forms the tomb of Cangrande I (1 221-1329) above the side entrance of the church not far from the tomb of Mastino II (De Maffei 1954, pp. 21-22, pls. 1,7). Two barely visible sketches on the lower left might be abandoned studies of the tomb chests of Mastino II and Cansignorio. At Innsbruck, the tomb of Emperor Maximilian I, executed according to the Emperor's own design of 1502, consists of the central porphyry sarcophagus with the praying figure of the Emperor on top, and twenty-eight bronze statues, designed and cast by various workshops between 1509-50. The additional figures represent ancestors and contemporaries in the guise of mourners who stand guard in the aisles to either side of the nave (Hye in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xv, p. 866; Egg 1974). Before Flaxman, Wright (1730, p. 497) briefly described the tomb on the journey back to Britain. Flaxman only sketches a lateral view of a group of male figures and the figures of Duke Ernst der Eiserne (l.r.) and King Theoderic of the Goths (u.r.). He records no more than the pose of the latter figure which in the sculpture is heavily armed and wearing a helmet, most of which is ignored by Flaxman (Egg 1974, figs. 25 and 37 (similar side views of groups of sculptures), 38 (Duke Ernst), 50 (Theoderic)). 316</page><page sequence="320">flaxman: v&amp;a sketchbook 2790 //f. 69V [unused] //f. 70r [unused] //f. 70V [unused] Notes //f. 7ir inscribed in graphite: ^ 10/S8 [?] P&lt;. . .&gt; E.h Drawings &lt;. . .&gt; &lt;. . &gt;s Location of source unknown //f. 71 v after unidentified ancient monument Graphite, image turned by 1800 A Temple Pediment In the centre of a pediment one or two figures are shown standing in a chariot that is drawn to the left by a quadriga.

He also published a magnificent volume, The Italian School of Design , 1808-23, with facsimile reproductions of eighty-four of his most treasured drawings, engraved directly from the originals. The volume is also notable for its critical insight, especially its analysis of the early Italian masters from Cimabue onwards. While travelling in Italy from 1791 to 1799, Ottley, as a young amateur artist of independent means based on his family's West Indian plantations, intent on practising his art, developing his connoisseurship, and forming a collection of old master paintings and drawings, had systematically copied some of the masterpieces of early Italian painting and sculpture that he had studied at Assisi, Florence, Orvieto, Perugia, Pisa and Rome. A full catalogue of these drawings is presented here. His ultimate purpose was to publish a volume of reproductive engravings; this eventually appeared in 1826 as A Series of Plates. This ambition, the focal point of this study, had brought him into contact with the great French antiquarian scholar, Séroux d'Agincourt, who was himself preparing a similar undertaking, Histoire de L'Art par les Monumens , published in 1810-23, and who employed Ottley as one of his copy artists. Ottley also collaborated in Italy with the Dutch artist, Humbert de Superville (1770-1849), who supplied many of the drawings Ottley eventually reproduced in 1826; Carlo Cencione, who was employed both by Séroux d'Agincourt and the Italian historian Guglielmo Della Valle as a draftsman at Orvieto, and also accompanied Ottley to Assisi and Perugia and supplied drawings for his 1826 volume. Ottley was also in close contact with the renowned Italian printmaker, Tommaso Piroli, principal engraver for Séroux d'Agincourt, who not only, prior to 1799, made twenty-six of the crisply focused prints for Ottley 's A Series of Plates , but also in 1796 published at Rome a brilliant series of twelve aquatints after Ottley's own inventions, perhaps here influenced by Flaxman, entitled Twelve Stories of the life of Christ , and then followed this up in 1797 with the exceptionally rare series of twelve aquatints with Twelve Stories of the Old Testament , again published at Rome but perhaps little distributed in those very troubled times. As we have already noted in the essay on Flaxman's Grand Tour, Piroli also worked for Flaxman and his patron, Mrs Hare- Naylor, engraving his drawings from The Iliad (1793) and The Odyssey (1795); and at about the same time, 1794, engraved, again in pure outline, for the German artist, Frederick Rehberg, Lady Hamilton's famous Attitudes, under the title Drawings Faithfully copied from Nature at Naples. Above all, Ottley made friends at Rome with John Flaxman who certainly played a part, c. 1792-94, in focusing the younger man's taste and his pioneering appreciation of early Italian art. We have seen how John Flaxman's artistic taste was deeply rooted in admiration for the clear contours of ancient Greek sculpture and the pure linear designs of Greek vase decoration. He found similar qualities in Byzantine mosaics and early Italian painting and sculpture. In his own sculpture, drawing and line engraving, too, he sought to achieve a purity of style that embodied moral truth and an ideal beauty rooted in the primitive forms of classical Greek and Byzantine art. In marked contrast, in his own art, still too little studied, William Young Ottley reveals a far more romantic 341</page><page sequence="344">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE temperament, increasingly inspired by John Henry Fuseli, and not unsympathetic to Gothic fantasy, but with a linear technique sometimes reminiscent of sixteenth-century mannerist artists such as Bandinelli, Cambiaso and Parmigianino. In a similar spirit, Ottley appears to have appro- ached the study of early Italian art, from Buffalmacco to Signorelli, Nicola Pisano to Donatello, from the opposite direction to Flaxman, through admiration of the classical designs of Raphael and above all a passion for the expressive forms and the visionary terribilità of Michelangelo, whose frescoes and sculptures he copied and whose drawings he later collected. He then looked back- wards, reasoning that the artists who prepared the ground for these outstanding High Renaissance personalities must, on that account alone, themselves be worthy of appreciation and understanding. As he wrote in 1826: 'it appears fair to infer, that there must have been something in the system of study and processes of the early Florentine masters, and in the principles by which they were governed, which was of a nature to lead to genuine excellence, and rendered them safe teachers of their art.9 Thus, in their shared interests in the evolution of early Italian art, Flaxman and Ottley became attracted to each other's company. Ottley made copies (Catalogue Part I, nos. 26 and 27) from Flaxman's drawings in the Yale Sketchbook (ff. 8r and i8r), after Ghiberti's relief sculpture at the Baptistery, Florence; and in his turn left copies of his own, from the façade of Orvieto Cathedral and the Campo Santo at Pisa, in Flaxman's V&amp;A Sketchbook (2790, ff. 43r and 45r). Ottley also copied drawings by Flaxman after the antique, which he preserved in an Album of Prints and Drawings after the Antique that only recently came to light at a London auction, where it was spotted by Kim Sloan and the present writer, and by mutual consent was acquired by the British Museum Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities; for a selective Catalogue of drawings from this unpublished source, see below, pp. 577-86. Among these are copies of a marble relief from the Temple of Hadrian, f. 36, signed and dated WY.O ijg2' and a Sarcophagus seen at the Palazzo Accoramboni, Rome (now Munich Glyptothek), ff. 42, 43, 44, inscribed but not dated by Ottley. The original Flaxman drawings recopied by Ottley have not been traced. It seems likely that occasionally Flaxman and Ottley also looked at antique art together and made independent copies. For instance, Ottley's copy of a Bacchic Sarcophagus (second century ad) in the garden façade of the Villa Medici, Rome, f. 78, which is signed and dated as made from the original in 1792, may be compared with Flaxman's copies of parts of the same sarcophagus in the V&amp;A Sketchbook (2790, ff. 4r and 5r). Ottley, who originated from Thatcham, Berkshire, and was educated at Winchester, was the nephew of Sir William Young (1749-1815) who had made his own Grand Tour in 1772, and had ventured as far as Sicily and Malta, accompanied by the well-known antiquarian and collector, Charles Townley, and the Scottish-based artist, John Brown (1752-87). Young's journal, illus- trated with his own drawings, now preserved at the British Library (MSS Stowe 791), was published privately in 1774. It may well have been through this family link that Ottley came to receive from Brown in 1786 drawing lessons that appear to have been profoundly influential. Brown had been in Italy for ten years from 1771-81, and there had fallen under the influence of Fuseli, who in his turn, during his own extended Roman sojourn (1770-78), had become 'an ardent devotee' of Michelangelo. Thus, through Brown, two hundred of whose drawings he bought following the artist's death in 1787, Ottley formed his taste and developed his own bold personal style, but still touched with the spirit of Fuseli; and he remained in close contact with Fuseli as late as 1803, as documented in an intriguing letter to Fuseli, from an art dealer, over which Ottley, perhaps in the company of Fuseli, has made chalk drawings (Fig. 1) of figures reminiscent of those in Michelan- gelo's Last Judgement.1 342</page><page sequence="345">WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY It was against this background, and after further training at the RA schools from 1788-91, that Ottley set off for Italy. If he kept ajournai, it remains undiscovered. He does not appear to have travelled in the spirit of a Grand Tourist, or to have echoed Flaxman's predictable route from Turin to Milan to Bologna and Florence, Rome and Naples, although his library, sold after his death (Leigh Sotheby, 21 July 1837), contained such guidebooks as those by F. Scotto, Itinerario d'Italia (Italian edition of Schottus 1600), Vicenza, 1615, an annotated copy of Richardson (1722) 1754 edition, and Lalande 1786. Rather he appears to have established a base at Rome from the outset, worked his way into the antiquarian circle around Séroux d'Agincourt, and explored his interest in the progression and development of Italian painting by selecting centres of excellence, through study of Vasari (he owned the Florence 1530, Bologna 1792 and the Milan 1807 editions and was certainly familiar with the Siena edition of 1791, with notes by Guglielmo Della Valle), Della Valle, Lettere Senesi 1782 to which he made MS additions, Alessandro da Morrona Pisa Illustrata 1787, Della Valle, Stampe del Duomo di Orvieto 1791, and L. Lanzi, Storia Pittorica , Bassano 1796. Thus he went on to make concentrated and focused expeditions, of extended duration, to the sites that most interested him, notably at Assisi, Florence, Perugia, Pisa and Orvieto, and with- out the necessity of digesting works of art in the random sequence associated with following a tourist route. Indeed, the professional methodology of his approach, with an emphasis on docu- mentary material, anticipating in some respects the great nineteenth-century German art historian Carl von Rumohr who also looked for primary sources, is nicely demonstrated in a letter Ottley, on the eve of completing his book, 2 October 1826, wrote to the bibliophile Dawson Turner who had lent him two recently published books on Assisi (probably Fea 1820 and Papini 1825). When I was at Assisi, a great part of the years 1 792-1 793, I extracted from a Ms then kept in the Convent - tho of no great age - and also from a scarce printed volume entitled "Hist Collis Paradisi" whatever I could find respecting the pictures - and among the rest lists of the Frescoes of the Old and New Testament by Cimabue and of the Life of St. Francis by Giotto which I think of some value, as even then some of those pictures were either entirely destroyed or so mutilated as to render the subjects unintelligible. At that time also I used endeavours, tho unsuccessfully, to get permission to examine the records of the convent in the hope of obtaining certain documents respecting the different artists employed &amp; the dates of their respective performances. I now find from your books that verv few documents of this kind exist in the archives of the Convent.2 Reverting to this secondary literature, he concludes: 'I find likewise that the two writers disagree upon many occasions as to the authors of the Pictures See. &amp; in short I find that I must settle some of these knotty points with the help of Vasari and my own observations in the best way I am able.' Ottley seems to have had a dual purpose: to provide copies (now preserved at the Vatican; see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection Catalogue, Part II, below) for Séroux d'Agincourt who may well have met some of the considerable costs involved; and at the same time, surreptitiously perhaps, to make and retain copies, both by himself and his associates, for his own collection (see Ottley Collection Catalogue, below) and subsequent publication, backed up by his own research and connoisseurship. He must quickly have realized that Séroux d'Agincourt's style of reproduction, involving rudimentary small-scale engravings of an enormous volume of material, to illustrate the decline of art during the Middle Ages, left the door open for a more empathetic approach involving full-page illustrations carefully and sympathetically copied and engraved by sensitive draughtsmen, capable of capturing the precision and detail that lies at the heart of the evolving style 343</page><page sequence="346">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE of the early Italian masters from the thirteenth century onwards. As Ottley explained in the opening section of his 1826 volume, with a conviction that Séroux d'Agincourt would not have understood: A certain dryness of manner is, proverbially, a characteristic of the early painters. A common observer of their works sees and condemns this defect, and looks no further. A better instructed person will the less insist upon it, because he will find upon examination, that it was chiefly, if not solely, occasioned by the earnest desire of the restorers of Painting to attain the greatest possible degree of intelligence and correctness of imitation, in the objects represented by them in their pictures; not only in the contours and general forms of the figures, but also in the most minute details of their component parts. And it is worthy of remark, that this system was even more rigidly enforced by the principal masters of the close of the fifteenth century, who immediately preceded the glorious era of art already mentioned, than it had been by those of any former period. The fault of these old artists was, that, labouring to render their picture perfect in all its parts, they lost the effect of the whole; by giving to the minute subdivisions of the folds of the draperies, and to the other details of their work, a greater degree of distinctness, and consequently of importance, than they were entitled to. But whatever may be the defects of their works, they are more than compensated by positive beauties, and those of a very high kind. In respect of the three great requisites of invention, composition , and expression , and for the foldings of the draperies , the best productions of these periods may even now be studied with profit; and those of Giotto , especially . . . abound in examples in which, by the employment and ingenious distribution of the figures, the intended subject is developed with a degree of perspicuity seldom equalled, and perhaps never surpassed, by painters of later times. The principal purpose of the Catalogues that follow here is to present a comprehensive record of all the reproductive drawings that Ottley made himself or commissioned from his friends in Italy, both on behalf of Séroux d'Agincourt, and for his own purposes; to relate these to both authors' published work; and to define Ottley's distinctive contribution, both as a draughtsman and a writer, towards the critical process of rehabilitating the art and artists who preceded Michelangelo. We can trace the progress of his mission and his frequent movements in and out of Rome, which he had reached by April 1792, both from Mrs Flaxman's diary at the BL (Add. MSS 39792(A)), and above all from the detailed inscriptions on many of his drawings after Italian art and the reproductive engravings that he subsequently published, as recorded in these Catalogues. A note by Fuseli, recording that Ottley was at Bologna in 1792, at S. Michele in Bosco, looking at Ludovico Carracci paintings in the cloister, appears to be the earliest witness we have of his journey into Italy.3 Ottley's first known dated copies from Italy are after Michelangelo's Medici tombs at S. Lorenzo, Florence, dated February 1792, his Lamentation over the Dead Christ in the Duomo, dated 14 February 1792, and the Pietà in St. Peter's Rome dated April 1792, all of which were supplied to Séroux d'Agincourt. In June 1792 he was with the Flaxmans at Castello. And in September 1792 he spent two weeks at Orvieto, again with the Flaxmans. However, his most important assignment that year, and again in the following year, was at Assisi, where he and Cencione worked intensively together copying several of the scenes of the life of St. Francis in the upper church by the Master of the Legend of St. Francis, and where he alone copied The Creation of Man by Jacopo Torriti on the upper north wall of the nave, The Nativity by a Cimabue follower on the upper south wall of the nave, and The Archangel Michael and the Dragon by the Cimabue workshop on the west wall of the south transept. It would appear from what survives that Ottley retained these copies but passed on simplified, more schematic copies to Séroux d'Agincourt. Ottley also worked in the lower church, copying Pietro Lorenzetti's The Crucifixion , with a detail of the Three Maries, and The Burial of Christ ; The Lamentation over the dead Christ by the Master of 344</page><page sequence="347">WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY St. Francis; two scenes from the life of St Nicholas by the Master of the S. Nicola chapel, and two scenes from the life of St. Catharine by Andrea de Bartoli. Ottley was also accompanied to Assisi by Humbert de Superville but did not acquire, either for his own collection or for Séroux d'Agincourt, any of Humbert's drawings, most of which were details from the same frescoes, in both the upper and lower church, that Ottley himself had copied. On the other hand, Humbert's Collection, now at the Accademia, Venice, includes two or three Ottley drawings from Assisi, presumably received as gifts or exchanges among friends: a version of the Three Maries in The Crucifixion by Pietro Lorenzetti, virtually identical to the detail by Ottley in his own collection; a simplified version (line without the added grey wash) of the fresco of St. Nicholas throws gold bars to three poor children by the Master of the S. Nicola chapel; and The Vision of St. Martin by Simone Martini, signed and dated by Ottley, 1792 (see Humbert De Superville Collection Catalogue, below pp. 498-502). Although Ottley was absent from Rome from 26 March to 30 September 1793, as recorded by Mrs Flaxman, he found time to return to the Sistine Chapel, where he made a highly finished drawing of the right hand section of The Last Judgement , notable for its firm black chalk outlines, meticulous pen drawing and subtle deployment of brown and grey wash highlights (Fig. 3). 4 The drawing, signed and dated Will™ Y Ottley. delt. ab Orig. 1793, *s at the National Gallery of Scotland and seems distinct in character from the drawings in the Ottley Collection catalogued here. On the other hand it is comparable with another highly finished black chalk drawing from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, a copy of one of the ignudi (Fig. 4), which recently came to light among a portfolio of fifty-two sheets of Ottley's own creative drawings, that surfaced at Bloomsbury Auctions, London, in May 2009. The collection was acquired by Hill-Stone, New York, who then exhibited the individual drawings at the Fine Art Society Galleries, London, during Drawings Week July 2009. 5 The Ignudo has an almost sculptural three-dimensional presence and is too fully modelled to have been destined for the engraver. Like the Edinburgh drawing, it may well date from c. 1793. It is perhaps worth adding, as further evidence of Ottley's obsession with Michelan- gelo, that in the very same year he also cut up a large reproductive engraving by Volpato (1780) of the Sistine ceiling, with a separate segment assigned to each of the Sibyls, which he then shaded lightly in graphite. These images were then bound into a small vellum volume, inscribed Ottley on the spine and William Young Ottley Rome 1793 on the first folio. The book was recorded as at Marlborough Rare Books, London, in March 1992, incorrectly catalogued (cat. 145 no. 118) as an album of 49 ink and wash drawings; its present whereabouts are unknown. During the spring and summer of 1793, Ottley, as well as working at Assisi, was also involved in a major copying campaign, once again with Cencione and Humbert, at Orvieto and Perugia. At Orvieto he made unusually elaborate drawings after Signorelli in the Cappella di S. Brizio, and more schematic copies of the Ugolino di Prete Ilario frescoes in the Tribune. Humbert meanwhile made a long series of copies of the relief sculptures on the cathedral façade, by Maitani and his school (now in the Venice Accademia), and Ottley then copied many of Humbert's drawings, recording them as such. These he retained, but further copies (of copies) were supplied to Séroux d'Agincourt and remain in his collection at the Vatican. Cencione, who much earlier had made drawings of the Orvieto façade for Séroux d'Agincourt, a group also now in the Vatican archive (which allegedly somehow had been misappropriated by Della Valle for his volume of plates of the cathedral published in 1791),6 now made a number of further copies of the façade for Ottley's collection. At Perugia, Ottley and Cencione made simple outline copies after Perugino which were supplied to Séroux, together with a drawing by Ottley, signed and dated 1793, after the central 345</page><page sequence="348">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE section of Fra Angelico's Guidalotti altarpiece at S. Domenico. Ottley also supplied three drawings recording details of Nicola and Giovanni Pisano's Fontana Maggiore , in the centre of the city, retaining the primary set for himself, and allowing Humbert to make up an interesting composite drawing, incorporating details which are juxtaposed with further images from the great window in the Tribune of the Cathedral at Orvieto. Most interesting of all is Ottley's copy, which he retained but which is now at the BM, of a double-sided polyptych by the Master of St. Francis, dating from the mid-thirteenth century and with interesting Byzantine features in its iconography, which he saw at S. Francesco al Prato, Perugia, and which is now in the Galleria Nazionale, Perugia. In November to December 1796 Ottley made a trip to Naples with George Augustus Wallis, the landscape painter, but apparently made no copies of Italian art. There is little evidence of his activities in 1797, apart from sketching expeditions in the Roman campagna at Ariccia, to be discussed below. To this may be added a strikingly colourful anecdote by the history painter William Artaud (1763-1823), whose Roman visit from 1795-98 coincided with the French invasion, and who describes Ottley, in June 1797, riding 'a light grey decorated with splendid trappings - prancing up the Strada Felicia to turn with a grace that astonished all the little children and old thread spinners in the neighbourhood. A superb sabre with a gilded hilt graced his manly thigh, and the martial expression of his physiognomy revealed that of the Woeful Countenance'.7 We have to wait until 1798 for the next series of dated copies, made at Florence, by a group that included Ottley, Humbert and, for the first time, Tommaso Piroli. Although some material found its way back to Séroux d'Agincourt, notably drawings by Ottley after Andrea Pisano's relief sculptures on the door of the Baptistery, Florence, one has the impression that the 1798 campaign may have been orchestrated by Ottley, with his eye now more firmly focused on his own publishing project, rather than on that of the French impresario and author. Both Ottley and Humbert copied relief panels from Andrea Pisano's doors of the Baptistery. Humbert made a particularly highly finished study, ready for the engraver (himself in this instance), of two scenes: Transporting the body of St. John the Baptist; The Burial of St. John the Baptist , now in the Ottley collection, but he retained for himself many of the preliminary studies, now at Venice. Both artists also worked together at S. Croce. They each copied panels from the now dismembered Armadio in the Sacristy, now attributed to Taddeo Gaddi but then attributed to Giotto; some of Humbert's work here was acquired by Ottley; other related drawings, retained by the artist, are at Venice. While Ottley copied part of the fresco by Agnolo Gaddi of The Legend of the True Cross in the Choir, and Giotto's Baroncelli altarpiece; Humbert, for Ottley's collection, made a careful drawing of part of a fresco cycle by Giovanni da Milano in the Rinuccini chapel, showing Joachim driven from the Temple by the High Priest. Piroli was also brought in, presumably on Ottley's initiative, to copy Matteo di Pacino's The Birth of the Virgin from the same fresco cycle; and he subsequently engraved both his own drawing and Humbert's for Ottley's volume. Both Humbert and Piroli also made careful drawings for Ottley in S. Maria Novella, Humbert copying Andrea da Firenze in the Spanish chapel, Piroli recording Filippino Lippi in the Strozzi chapel. If Ottley himself made any copies there, they have not survived. Lastly, Humbert made extremely elaborate copies of Donatello's relief sculptures of The Deposition and The Entombment from the north pulpit in S. Lorenzo, works which Flaxman had also admired and copied, and may have drawn to Ottley's attention. At the Campo Santo, Pisa, Ottley and Humbert again returned to two scenes that Flaxman had already selected for copying (V&amp;A 2790, ff. 28r and 29r): Buffalmacco's Christ passing sentence on the wicked. The Last Judgement, of which Humbert made a carefully executed graphite drawing 346</page><page sequence="349">WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY which Ottley retained, although he sent a more schematic pen and ink drawing of the same scene, apparently made by himself independently, to Séroux ď Agincourt; and the group of lepers from the Buffalmacco The Triumph of Death, which Ottley copied, again in pen and ink, but in this case with more precision. Ottley also went on to make pen and ink drawings of further selected details from these frescoes: a group of agitated courtly supplicants from The Last Judgement , as well as numerous images of flying angels, taken from this and other scenes including The Crucifixion. He retained some, while others were sent to Séroux d'Agincourt. Finally the two artists turned their attention to Benozzo Gozzoli's frescoes, from which Humbert made an unusually complex and elaborate copy of the left-hand section of the scene depicting Abraham's victory over the Assyrian Kings. Ottley's campaign came to an end at Rome in 1799, with copies made by Piroli, and subsequently engraved by him also, of Fra Angelico's frescoes in the private chapel of Pope Nicholas V at the Vatican. These drawings were retained by Ottley, and reproduced by him in 1826. A full survey of all the copies made under Ottley's direction during the period 1792-99 reveals a remarkable variety in the nature and quality of the drawings thus obtained. Whereas Humbert de Superville and Piroli appear invariably to have produced work of a precision suitable for translation into the medium of reproductive engraving in which they were well versed, Ottley himself, on the other hand, appears to have worked in an astonishing variety of styles, responding both to the nature of the material he was addressing, and also, without doubt, the ultimate destination and intended function of each particular drawing. As Henri Loyrette has observed, Ottley's earliest recorded drawings, the studies in the Vatican archive after Michelangelo, have a distinct mannerist quality: Ce qui fait l'intérêt principal de ces dessins, c'est l'interprétation maniériste de l'oeuvre de Michel-Ange; par la frénésie des hachures dans les dessins à la plume, l'angle de vue qui place constamment l'oeuvre étudiée en hauteur et en souligne l'effet écrasant, l'accentuation très nette des tendances 'cubistes', les violents effets de chiaroscuro dans les copies au lavis, les dessins s'apparentent au courant néo-maniériste de la fin du xviii siècle.8 Ottley employed a similar technique in his drawings after Andrea Pisano's reliefs at the Baptistery, Florence, and even in his details of angels and other figures in the frescoes at the Campo Santo, Pisa, which assume an almost sculptural quality. Yet elsewhere, Ottley employs a flatter, broader, less nervous style, seen for instance in his copy in graphite of Jacopo Torriti's The Creation of Man, in the upper church at Assisi, or his copy in pen and black ink with grey wash, of The Nativity , by a Cimabue follower, also in the upper church. Occasionally he completes a more elaborate composition, such as The Dream of Pope Innocent III by the Master of the Legend of St. Francis, executed with pen and black ink, graphite and grey washes, capturing the tonal values of the picture as well as the overall design and the details of drapery folds. However, when the time comes to supply Séroux d'Agincourt with copies for his corpus, Ottley reverts to a more schematic shorthand, as if recognizing that for the French historian these drawings are little more than reference material. Thus the Vatican version of The Creation of Man is executed in pen and ink, and even the one scene from the life of St. Francis by the Master of the Legend of St. Francis that is still preserved at the Vatican, Lérida who had received a Mortal Wound Healed in a Vision of St. Francis , is reduced virtually to an outline drawing in pen and ink, with traces of graphite. The same applies to the drawings at the Vatican of the Orvieto Cathedral façade where Ottley supplies his own copies from Humbert de Superville's original 347</page><page sequence="350">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE copies; or the drawings by Ottley after Fra Angelico and Perugino at Perugia where again Ottley confines himself to a simple linear technique in pen and ink. On the other hand, when Ottley is copying to please himself he occasionally rises to extraordi- nary heights of virtuosity. His drawing of The Archangel Michael and the Dragon after Cimabue, in the upper church at Assisi, with its frenzied use of the pen, bold outlines and uninhibited cross-hatching to represent damaged sections of the fresco, might have challenged any reproductive engraver, yet it captures the drama and conflict of the scene with energy and conviction. His drawing, in the lower church, of the Three Maries, a detail from Pietro Lorenzetti's The Crucifixion , executed in black ink over grey wash over graphite; his drawing after the damaged The Lamentation over the dead Christ by the Master of St. Francis (Ottley Collection Cat. no. 12), made with pen and ink and heavy grey wash; and his copy of Andrea da Bartoli's fresco of The Martyrdom of St. Catharine , made in pen and ink and grey wash, with magical but economical brushwork in the depiction of the landscape background, all serve to remind us that for Ottley the pleasurable dis- covery of these early artists at Assisi was far more than an art-historical exercise or a publishing venture. A similar passion evidently inspired his copies in 1793 of Signorelli at Orvieto. The copies of The Fall of Antichrist and The Wicked destroyed at the end of the world by fire from heaven are arguably his greatest achievements and bring us closest to his own taste, to be reflected, as we shall see, in his own creative activity as an artist in Italy, where linear precision gives way to vigorous brush- work and where compositions are conceived and executed largely through light and shade. (It may be instructive here to compare Ottley's variant techniques with the Genoese artist, Giovanni David, who in 1776 engraved for Giacomo Durazzo copies of Mantegna's frescoes at the Eremitani, Padua, first in pure outline etching and then, as a separate series, reworked to emphasize the chiar- oscuro; or his satirical series of Venetian characters, Divers Portraits, 1775, issued as pure outline etching and then reworked with aquatint.9) A surprisingly large number of the best copies from Italy in Ottley's Collection are by his associate Humbert de Superville. Humbert's style is far more controlled than Ottley's, with an almost abstract precision and analytical focus. His technique is also firmer and more precise than that of Flaxman in comparable copies; and, although as a creative artist Humbert may have lacked the coherence and focus of the English sculptor, as a copyist he is supreme. Presumably Ottley quickly recognized this and commissioned from him many of the images destined for publication in 1826. Most of the drawings by Humbert de Superville in Ottley's Collection are the finished product, ready for the engraver. However, Humbert's meticulous preparatory work on many of these plates, especially the scenes of Transporting the Body of St. John the Baptist and The Burial of St. John the Baptist, from Andrea Pisano's gates at the Baptistery, Florence, reproduced by Ottley 1826, plate XI, as well as the hast Supper from the Armadio by Taddeo Gaddi in the Sacristy at S. Croce, Florence, reproduced by Ottley 1826, plate XX (alongside Ottley's own matching copy of The Transfiguration), are all preserved in his own collection at Venice. Humbert, after supporting the French revolutionary cause and joining the French army in 1799, was imprisoned in the papal fortress at Civitavecchia from September/November 1799 to February 1800 and was then expelled from Italy. He went on to publish a philosophical volume, steeped in structuralist theory, entitled Essai sur les signes inconditionnels dans Vart, Leiden, 1827/32, but none of this ever impinged on his professional activities for and with Ottley, who certainly had no interest either in semiotic analysis, or revolutionary politics and whose approach to art was rooted in the appreciation of the richness of its material forms.10 348</page><page sequence="351">WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY Tommaso Piroli's copies are also meticulously executed with a noticeably delicate use of outline, for instance in The Birth of the Virgin by Matteo di Pacino at S. Croce, the Fra Angélicos at the Vatican, and Filippino Lippi's Two Muses in S. Maria Novella. Sadly, his drawing after Masaccio's St. Paul visiting St. Peter in S. Maria del Carmine is lost, recorded now only in Sartain's more prosaic engraving, published by Ottley, pl. XLIII. Ottley's own creative work as an artist in Italy has received surprisingly little detailed critical attention, although Nancy Pressly and Kim Sloan have each addressed the issue. Sloan has looked at his landscape drawings, made on sketching expeditions in the Roman campagna in the summer of 1797. There are two such studies in the BM. She also draws attention to two close-up studies of ferns and foliage, executed in pen and ink over graphite, last recorded at Berlin in a private collec- tion around ten years ago. One is inscribed: L'Arriccia 1797. However, Ottley was not primarily a landscape artist and, as Sloan observes, he sometimes approaches trees 'as if they were figures and invests them with an almost anthropomorphic quality'.11 Pressly evaluates his links with the Fuseli circle, as well as the Signorelli influence, and draws attention to a series of drawings related to Shakespeare's The Tempest , at Yale and the BM, one of which is dated 1804. 12 Pressly also reproduces a drawing of The Transfiguration , at Yale (Fig. 10), made in preparation for one of the aquatints produced by Piroli after Ottley's designs for the volume Twelve Stories of the Life of Christ , published at Rome in 1796. 13 In fact, five of Ottley's drawings connected with this New Testament series are bound in with the prints in the Yale volume, apparently a presenta- tion copy individually bound for the artist, and are reproduced here beside seven further drawings bound into the same volume but not connected directly with the project although the museum's own captions to the photographs might suggest otherwise. The drawings demonstrate clearly Ottley's debt to Flaxman and the wider influence of the Italian art they were both copying 1792-94. The scene of The Nativity (Fig. 5) is remarkably close both to Ottley's and Flaxman's independent copies of Ghiberti's relief of this subject on the north door of the Florence Baptistery. Ottley's somewhat understated schematic drawings of the Mary Magdalene at the feet of Jesus in the Pharisee's House (Fig. 9), The Transfiguration (Fig. 10), and The Resurrection (Fig. 16) all recall Flaxman's economic style at this time. On the other hand, the sketch of The Dead Christ with the Maries (Fig. 14) has a more emphatic chiaroscuro which is clarified by Piroli in his print. Indeed, Piroli undoubtedly deserves to share with Ottley the credit for rationalizing and giving internal consistency to this impressive series. Some of the unconnected drawings in the Yale volume are less interesting, or appear so now for lack of context: The Christ child learning to read (Fig. 6) is a subject to which Ottley often returned, for instance in an album of cut-out small sketches and fragments, hitherto ignored, at the V&amp;A,14 yet it was never developed in a print or large-scale drawing. There are further drawings of The Crowning of the Infant King (Fig. 11), a group of five Kings kneeling and removing their crowns in adoration (Fig. 7), and a crouching figure tending others on the ground (Fig. 8). In dramatic con- trast, a powerful drawing of St. Michael fighting as commander of the celestial armies (Fig. 12), another drawing of an angel fighting (Fig. 13), and two studies of fighting or fallen men (Fig. 15), may all perhaps relate to Ottley's preparations for the one picture he ever exhibited at the RA, The Fall of the Angels. Although the picture, apparently inspired by Milton's Paradise Lost , executed in black and white, was not shown until 1833 (no. 233), there is clear evidence that it was initially conceived by Ottley in Italy, as his response to Cimabue in the upper church at Assisi, Signorelli at Orvieto and Michelangelo's Last Judgement , and that it became a persistent obsession. 349</page><page sequence="352">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE The evidence is to be found in the hitherto unrecorded Hill-Stone portfolio of Ottley drawings, to which reference has already been made. Here we find several drawings (Figs. 18 and 19) of A Battle in the sky , with fighting angels and opposing air-borne warriors, one dated Roma 1798. We find, too, a striking two-sided study of the very same figure of St. Michael fighting as commander of the celestial armies (Fig. 17) that apparently precedes the St. Michael in the Yale volume (Fig. 12) where the alternative poses in the two-sided drawing are resolved and consolidated. However, the Hill-Stone album is of even greater interest in its relationship with Ottley's Twelve Stories of the Old Testament , for which Piroli again produced aquatints, published at Rome in 1797. No complete copy of this book is to be found in any of the principal London libraries. Nor is it at Yale, the British School Rome or even at the Vatican. Maybe it was never issued in a bound format. In any event, ten of the individual prints can be found at the Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, USA; and all the copper plates, including plates 4 and 11, which represent Cain (But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth. Genesis, 4, v. 5) and Abraham and Isaac ( Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering. Genesis 22, v. 7), from both of which there are no known prints, are at the Huntington library, although alas they almost defy conventional photography. Together this is sufficient to establish that the entire series is concerned with The Creation and all but the last scene are taken from Genesis, although here too some of the scenes are equally to be found also in Paradise Lost. Thus we can recognize that the Hill-Stone portfolio includes fully resolved drawings for plate 2, The Creation of Eve (And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man , made he a woman. Genesis, 2, v. 22.); plate 5, The Flood (And all flesh died. Genesis 7, v. 21), with Noah's ark shown at the top; as well as a drawing for the fighting figures in the left background of plate 12, Moses supported by Aaron and Hur (And Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands , the one on the one side , and the other on the other side ; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. Exodus, 17, v. 12). To these may be added a further drawing at the BM, already well known, for plate 8, A Warrior on Horseback (And he divided himself against them , he and his servants by night , and smote them and pursued them. Genesis, 14, v. 15). These drawings are reproduced here as Figs. 20-23. The Hill-Stone album also includes a dramatic Scene of Destruction (reproduced here as Fig. 24) that might have been made when Ottley was preparing plate 9 from the Old Testament series, where the two Angels who were in the house of Lot and his daughters 'smote them that were at the door of the house with blindness' (Genesis, 19, v. 11), and where one finds very similar figures languishing in the foreground. Clearly in the present drawing the men are not blind but they could be victims from the next biblical scene, where God rains fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis, 19, v. 24), that followed the scene of the blinded men. Other drawings in the portfolio, a study of Gigantic men fallen in retreat (Fig. 25) and A Warrior fighting off an attack from above (Fig. 26), might also be brought into this context. Another drawing, described as a Scene of Expulsion (Fig. 24b), closely related to the Scene of Destruction, executed in vigorous pen and grey and brown wash, recently came to light through Anthony Mould and is now in a private collection.15 It has almost identical figures in the foreground but the figures clinging to trees in the upper section are quite different. Reproduced as an advert in the British Art Journal , it was said to be inscribed on the reverse W.Y. O.Oct. 1791, a surprisingly precise date, and moreover much earlier than the 1797 implied by my suggested connection of the Scene of Destruction (Sodom and Gomorrah ?) (Fig. 24a) to the Old Testament Piroli aquatint series. The pencil inscription on the Mould drawing is not dissimilar to the pencil inscriptions on the early nineteenth-century watermarked mounts (181 1 in some cases) supporting most of the Hill-Stone Portfolio drawings. Although these inscriptions 350</page><page sequence="353">WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY might well be autograph, they would appear to have been added very much later, perhaps when Ottley, towards the end of his life, was arranging his affairs. The reading of the date on the ex-Mould drawing as 1791 is not in doubt; the final digit is definitely 1 not 7. However, in my opinion the word previously read as Oct actually reads abt., thus suggesting the date is approximate and based on distant memory, not specific and contemporary with the drawing.16 Nevertheless, this intriguing dilemma serves as a reminder of how little hard evidence we have of the chronol- ogy of Ottley's creative work - in marked contrast to his copies after Italian art, 1792-99, which invariably are meticulously signed and dated, usually in ink - especially at the outset of his career, before he went to Italy. With the possible exception of The Creation of Eve which recalls the façade at Orvieto, all these drawings, those for the 1797 Piroli Old Testament Series, those for the Battle of the Angels , and those associated with the Scene of Destruction, neo-mannerist in their distortions and exaggerated forms, seem to take us rapidly away from the aesthetic values Ottley hitherto had shared with Flaxman, into a visionary extravagant world. Beyond the terribilità of Signorelli and Michelangelo, or even, for instance, the intoxicating inventions of the classical seventeenth-century Lucchese artist, Pietro Testa, whose prints Ottley certainly would have known, we are involved in a romantic experience matched only by Fuseli, who was also obsessed with Milton, and by Blake. Perhaps the German critic, Gustav Waagen, best evaluates this style, albeit from a European perspective, after he has seen Ottley's black and white painting Fall of the Angels in his London home in 1835: In his study there hang the Fall of the bad Angels, after Milton, which he had executed in black and white, in the taste of Michael Angelo, but not without originality, and with considerable skill; whence I perceived that he was well versed in the practical part of the art. This picture is a proof of the twofold predilection which has long been general among English artists for Milton and Michael Angelo. This arises from the innate feeling of the English for the sublime efforts of imagination, but has produced practically, in painting, very little good. With respect to Milton, he is least of all suited to afford subjects for painting precisely where he is greatest - the representation of the characters and manners of his fallen angels. Forms and images are with him so colossal, that they must lose when they are repre- sented to the senses. The best traits of mind are too subtiley [sic] dialectic for the painter to transfer them with success to his art. To create works of art in the spirit of Michael Angelo, the English artists are deficient in powers of invention, and in depth of scientific knowledge . . . Henry Fiissli, or as the English call him, Fuseli, a Swiss, was the only man in England of considerable talents who cherished the illusion, that without profound study, and by means of a fertile but distorted imagination, he could soar to the spheres where such exalted spirits as Michael Angelo and Shakspeare, unapproachable by far mightier minds than his, pursue their eternal course. Even in the most successful of his shadowy pictures with the long figures, he can be called at the most the insane, emaciated ghost of Milton. He was an ardent critic; and in this view he was very eminent. He has still in Mr. Ottley and others very warm admirers in England.17 It was probably on his way home to England via Germany early in 1799 (or possibly in 1791 on his arrival in Italy) that Ottley stopped at Leghorn and made a series of four exceptionally well- executed pen and ink copies, on two sheets (Figs. 27a and b, 28a and b) of the Statue of Ferdinando dey Medici J, in the Piazza della Darsena, by Giovanni dell'Opera, and Pietro Tacca who was responsible for the four striking slaves below the statue.17 The style of these drawings, which also originate from the Hill-Stone portfolio, and which are signed but not dated, is familiar from Ottley's earlier copies of sculpture already described, especially the Michelangelo Lamentation in Florence (see p. 344 and pp. 473-74 Cat. no. 7) except that here the modelling is far sharper and 351</page><page sequence="354">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE the angular, almost cubist, forms of the slaves have a remarkably expressive intensity. This late sixteenth-century sculpture is too advanced in date to have qualified for reproduction in Ottley's book, and doubtless this explains why the drawings did not find their way into Ottley's Collection of copies catalogued here, but were preserved instead in the recently rediscovered portfolio of his creative drawings. This still begs the question of why Ottley took the time to make these outstand- ingly striking studies. If executed early, they might have been intended as a form of visiting card to impress potential clients. If late, a final flourish, or perhaps he was simply filling time while dealing with shipping arrangements for the substantial collections of old master paintings and drawings he had made in Italy. Ottley had been able to take advantage of the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the subsequent suppression of the religious orders, and the general economic vulnerability of the Italian nobility, to acquire outstanding old master paintings and drawings, doubtless on favourable terms, but nevertheless beyond the means of most young visiting artists from Britain. Unfortunately no account books, receipts or other paperwork relating to these transactions have ever come to light; and the market was at best irregular. On the one hand he appears to have consciously speculated in conventional old masters of the High Renaissance and the seventeenth century, acquired from the Aldobrandini, Borghese, Colonna, and Corsini Palaces in Rome, the Royal Collection at Naples and other prestigious sources, of the kind that professional dealers such as William Buchanan would import from Genoa, Rome and Florence a few years later. Most of Ottley's pictures were then marketed aggressively in London in a sequence of exhibitions, at 3 1 Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, in 1799; and then at 118 Pall Mall in 1801; before finding their way to Christie's for an auction sale on 16 May 1801.19 Among the Renaissance pictures on offer may be counted Raphael's Sleeping Warrior (N.G. 213 as An Allegory ); St Jerome (Raleigh, North Carolina 1965.21.1); and a cartoon of a Horse's head for the Vatican Heliodorus at the Ashmolean, Oxford (556); Titian's Herodias (Norton Simon Museum) and Holy Family and a Shepherd (N.G. 4); Michelangelo's (attributed) The Samaritan Woman (Liverpool Walker A.G.). These are followed by two works of Parmigianino, the Self Portrait (N.G. 6441) and The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (N.G. 6427); an Agostino Carracci Susanna (Sarasota); and Annibale Carracci Christ mocked (Bologna Pinacoteca Naz.). There were fine landscapes by Rosa (Detroit 47.91 and N.G. 84); Gaspard Dughet (N.G. 161); Claude's Ascanius killing a Stag (Ashmolean 376) and Dido and Aeneas (Hamburg 783). Nevertheless the profits were only slowly realized, and many of the works were bought in, and reoffered in the following years, most notably at Christie's on 25 May 181 1. At the same time, but in a different spirit, Ottley also collected early Italian pictures to consolidate his researches and copying activity in Italy.20 Indeed, with strong examples of Byzantine and Sienese art, his collection extends well beyond the Florentine axis of his 1826 volume of reproductive engravings. This collection was retained until after his death and only offered for sale by his heirs at Foster's on 30 June 1847 and 24 June 1850. By then it had been admired by Gustav Waagen who published a long and informed description in 1838: Some genuine Byzantine pictures of great age and skilful execution are at the head. But the paintings of the old school of Sienna are peculiarly important. To my great joy I found here the larger portion of the panels of the picture by Ugolino da Siena which, according to Vasari, he painted for the high altar in the church of St. Croce at Florence. Having noted the various sections of the fragmented altarpiece (now N.G. 1 188), he comments on two distinct stylistic influences: 352</page><page sequence="355">WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY In the male saints, the antique Byzantine style prevails; the heads are of an oblong shape, the eyes well formed and well opened, the noses long and curved at the tip, the mouth of a delicate and decided shape, the bodies are stretched, the arms thin, the fingers long and bony, the folds of the admirably cast draperies very sharp. In the angels as well as in the figures in the predella, on the contrary, the forms are fuller, the movements freer and more dramatic, and nearer to the manner and style of Simone Martini. Nor are they painted with the clammy dark cement of the Byzantines, but in the fluid, clearer distemper of Giotto, with yolk of egg and parchment glue, and a previous layer of verditter . . .21 Many of the other pictures that Waagen singled out were not auctioned but disposed of privately. These included Gentile da Fabriano's Madonna and Child , which Waagen compared to The Adora- tion of the Magi (Uffizi), and which was offered by Ottley's heirs to the Royal Collection; Pesellino's altarpiece of The Trinity (N.G. 727), recorded by Vasari at Pistoia; and Botticelli's Nativity (N.G. 1034), the first correctly attributed picture by the artist ever to reach Britain, apparently acquired from the Aldobrandini collection, Rome. And he then concludes, correctly but a trifle smugly: Mr Ottley is one of the few persons who recognised the noble and rich intellectual treasures in these ancient works of art at a time when they were, in general, despised or forgotten. Unfortunately this is still the case in England. By the time of Waagen's visit Ottley had already, in 1823, sold most of his old master drawings to Sir Thomas Lawrence for .£8,000, but the German visitor was shown a collection of cut-out illuminated MSS that were later auctioned by Leigh Sotheby on 11 and 12 May 1838, with a remarkably uninformative catalogue. It is yet further evidence of Ottley's extraordinary range of interests. Some of this material was collected after Ottley's return to England; he remained in touch with the market and was responsible for cataloguing the important sale of miniatures imported from Italy by the Abate Celotti, at Christie's on 26 May 1825, where indeed he then bought fifteen lots for himself.22 Ottley's acquisition of old master drawings in Italy was on an even more spectacular scale than his collections of paintings.23 He was able to buy sheets by Raphael and Michelangelo, Correggio and Parmigianino, as well as Signorelli and earlier Italian artists from the time of Giotto. Some came from well-known collections, Martelli and Gori at Florence, Cavaceppi at Rome, Zanetti at Venice. Others came from other opportunist collectors of the day, including the Scotsman, Pryse Gordon, and the French painter and government official, J. B. Wicar.24 Perhaps the most inter- esting way to evaluate the collection is not from the sale catalogues that preceded the Lawrence deal, in particular the auction by T. Philipe, 6-8 June 1814, where many but not all lots were bought in, but from Ottley's own publication The Italian School of Design. This ambitious project, which comprised superb facsimile engravings made directly from eighty-four of the originals, was issued in parts from 1808 to 1823. As John Gere observed, in the best available study of Ottley's drawing collecting: 'the eighty-odd plates, some of which Ottley engraved himself . . . are tours de force of facsimile engraving; never, even with the most elaborate mechanical processes, have drawings been more faithfully reproduced.'25 The team of artists, which also included G. and F. C. Lewis, T. Vivares and W. Long, employed a vast variety of specialist intaglio techniques ranging from aquatint to stipple engraving, soft ground etching, black chalk manner, red chalk manner, and crayon manner. Perhaps under the pressure of disposing of his speculative acquisitions, Ottley appears to have allowed this project to take priority over the volume of engravings after the Florentine masters that had preoccupied him in Italy, to the extent that it is in The Italian School of Design , 1808-23, that we first read his views on early Italian artists, including Cimabue, Giotto (aquatint by George Robert Lewis; reproduced p. 354), Masaccio; Nicola Pisano, and onwards to 353</page><page sequence="356">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE George Robert Lewis as after Giotto [Florentine, c. 1400] Six standing women.

Where appropriate, quotations from this critical material are cited in the Catalogue of Ottley's Collection of copies presented here. Of course the book, for all its precocious insights, also exposes occasional shortcomings in connoisseurship. Thus a copy of Piero della Francesca's still little visited fresco at Arezzo, The Dream of Constantine, is classified by Ottley as a drawing by Giorgione (soft ground etching by Frederick Christian Lewis; reproduced p. 355). And a Bandinelli drawing of The Deposition (aquatint by J. Vivares) is incorrectly associated with Donatello's pulpit relief at S. Lorenzo, Florence; confusion between the drawings of these two artists was common at the time. 354</page><page sequence="357">355 WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY (above left) Thomas Vivares after Signorelli, Warrior on Horseback.

These efforts resulted in another seminal publication An Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of Engraving on Copper and Wood, London, i8i6.Whereas many collectors were led from their study and collecting of prints to an appreciation of early Italian art,26 Ottley leaves us in no doubt that in his case the process started the other way round with his study, copying and collecting of painting in Italy. As he explains, in the Introduction, in the course of this pursuit of Finiguerra: I became so far a connoisseur in the very early pictures commonly known under the generic and opprobrious term, Gothic, that I sometimes found myself in a situation to pronounce as to the probable authenticity of a picture attributed to Cimabue, Giotto, Giovanni da Fiesole, or Luca Signorelli, with the same confidence that others feel in deciding as to the originality of a work of RafFaelle, Titian, or Domenichino.27 And thus he felt emboldened to enter into the much-debated Finiguerra problem and in the process wrote a detailed book on the history of printmaking, which, as Antony Griffiths has pointed out, was 'far in advance of anything published up to that time in any language, and even if over the heads of almost every English critic of the time, must have had a considerable impact'.28 In 1823 the Italian School of Design serial project was wound up, having commendably included Poussin, but without quite meeting its initially advertised objective to record not only the rise of Italian art from Cimabue to Michelangelo, but also its decline. Instead Ottley now reverted to the Series of Plates of the Florentine school. He hired the little-known young American, John Sartain (1803-97), to complete the task of engraving the selected drawings from his portfolio and reworking some of the plates engraved by Piroli in Italy. For some considerable time these precious copper plates had been left neglected and unclaimed after their shipment from Italy in 1799. As Ottley explained to Dawson Turner, in a letter of 18 January 1827, when attempting to explain away some other embarrassing act of procrastination: when in the year 1799 I returned via Hamburg from Italy, I absolutely put up with the loss of about six and thirty engraved copper plates, done at Rome from my own drawings whether by myself or Piroli, merely because I was too lazy to find the direction of and write to a captain in the navy, who had been so good as to take charge of them in order to save me trouble at the Custom House.29 Sartain, in his Reminiscences , has left an intimate account of working in a corner of Ottley's picture gallery, and bringing this project to fruition. Many of his rather prosaic tracings, often in red ink, remain in the Ottley Collection and have been catalogued here alongside the drawings from which he worked. I began work on the plates in 1823, and continued at it twenty months. During that time, I engraved throughout eighteen of the plates, and worked up to finish fourteen others left incomplete by Piroli. Several of Piroli's plates I had to alter considerably, scooping out parts and punching up from the back of an anvil before proceeding to finish, so that I became quite expert. A Nativity by Sandro Botticelli, I engraved from the original picture, owned by Mr. Ottley, and worked it up to its full effect. The others were from Humbert's drawings. Three of the plates I engraved throughout before I was fifteen, two being after Benozzo Gozzoli; Abraham entertaining the angels, and a group from a wall in the Campo Santo at Pisa. The third was after Giotto. The last three I did were from Luca Signorelli, after his frescoes in the Duomo at Orvieto: The Wicked destroyed at the End of the World, a group of demons from his Inferno , and a group of angels from 356</page><page sequence="359">WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY his picture of heaven. I also engraved from the façade of the same cathedral a sculptured group by Niccola Pisano, and I have since seen the originals at Orvieto. Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Donatello and others were among the artists I copied.30 He goes on to describe his surroundings. This delightful work was performed amidst charming surroundings, of themselves an education. My engraving table stood in the corner of a picture gallery, the walls covered with admirable paintings by great masters. He then describes a second gallery also lighted from above, the walls of which were covered from floor to ceiling with pictures by the old pre-Raphaelite artists, which Mr. Ottley had collected in Italy . . . most of them were taken from churches during the occupation by the French soldiery, and but for Mr. Ottley's intervention might have been destroyed.31 By the time the Series of Plates was published, it had been overtaken by such luxurious and seminal works as Carlo Lasinio's Pitture a Fresco del Campo Santo di Pisa , published at Florence in 1812, where the purity and clarity of outline of the reproductive engravings is often said to have inspired the Pre-Raphaelites.32 Ottley's book, however, served a different purpose.33 Apart from providing a reliable record in an era without photographs, readily acknowledged by scholarly writers of the next generation such as Lord Lindsay, it also concentrated attention on the stylistic characteristics of major fresco cycles and sculptural friezes, by often selecting details or separate components, rather than an entire cycle. In this way it assisted and encouraged the still developing art of connoisseurship in the evaluation of early Italian art, and a visual rather than an antiquarian approach, stimulating discerning collecting, already evident in Germany, rather than the accumulation of historical curiosities. If Ottley was an amateur , it was in the very best and traditional sense of that word. His independent means and lack of accountability undoubtedly enabled him to explore Italy at leisure and study and publish works of art that were far from fashionable, and in some cases already seriously dilapidated, and thus cried out for serious study and sensitive reproduction. This was an expensive and time-consuming undertaking that depended on his friendships with an impressive team of talented artists, the self-effacing Tommaso Piroli in particular, and knowledgeable Italian antiquarians. It also required unflagging perseverance. Although Flaxman was never directly involved in Ottley's publications, one senses that he in particular provided both stimulus and encouragement to his young friend, and indeed it was to him that Ottley dedicated the Series of Plates. Ottley's financial strength and educated eye had enabled him to make opportunistic acquisi- tions in Italy that underpinned his research, his connoisseurship, and his art-historical interests, but also provided material dividends that cannot have passed unnoticed by less well-placed or quick-thinking members of the professional art trade. As for Ottley's own art, it may be no coin- cidence that it was only after Flaxman had left Italy that he veered off into a romanticism strongly coloured by Fuseli and far removed from the minimalism and restraint of the English sculptor's graphic inventions. Yet, even at his most ebullient, Ottley was far too well informed to lose sight of Italy's artistic traditions and classical heritage; and it was within this context that he aspired to place his own inventions. In both his creative and his intellectual response he did far more both to record, preserve and reanimate those traditions than most of his more institutionalized contemporaries. 357</page><page sequence="360">HUGH BRIGSTOCKE Indeed Ottley's particular strength lay in his self-sufficient privacy as an independent scholar, free to pursue his visionary course without distraction, fear or favour. We know nothing about his religious or political affiliations; his art appreciation is never clouded by philosophical speculation or Hegelian dialectics. His approach was strictly object orientated, with a concern for art as a means of expression and as a manifestation of a long historical tradition. At home, as described by Waagen and Sartain, he lived surrounded by his books, prints and pictures, addressing them as the tools of his scholarly trade, for the preparation of his seminal publications and his ongoing activity as a collector. And here he quietly received artists, bibliophiles, collectors, and friends. His belated appointment as Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the BM, in 1833, came too late for him to make much impact there, but also saved him from bowing to the administrative demands and institutional thinking associated with a public position.34 And in any case, by then he had already done far more to educate taste and enrich the nation's stock of great paintings and drawings than anyone else active in the generation before Charles Eastlake.

NOTES 1 Letter addressed to H. Fuseli, Esq., R.A. St. Swithins Lane July 7 1803 Sir, If you are inclined to see a few of the finest Pictures of the Italian School that ever came into the kingdom and which are likely to be soon taken abroad, I will be very happy to shew them to you (&amp; a friend) any day you may previously appoint.

One might speculate that Ottley accompanied Fuseli to see the collection and then drew on top of the invitation. A further rather similar drawing (Fig. 2), probably of around the same date, has annotations which suggest Ottley was also in touch with Henry Tresham, and various collectors including Lord Kinnaird, at around this time; and we already know, from The Diary of Joseph Farington, that Ottley and Tresham were involved in a joint publishing venture in late March 1807. See The Diary of Joseph Farington, ed. by K. Cave, Yale &amp; London, 1982, viu, p. 2999, under 31 March 1807. The joint publication, The British Gallery of Pictures, was eventually published in 18 18, four years after Tresham's death. Papers of Dawson Turner, Trinity College Library, Cambridge, réf.

He also allowed me, and also Kim Sloan of the BM, to preview the collection immediately before the London exhi- bition. The collection was gathered in a portfolio, inscribed on the outside cover: DRAWINGS BY W™ YOUNG OTTLEY 1790-98. The drawings have all been laid down on 358</page><page sequence="361">WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY IN ITALY mounts that appear to date from the first decade of the nine- teenth century. Stone initially suggested the majority of the drawings, excluding the obvious Italian copies, such as the Michelangelo, might also date from after Ottley's return home from Italy, not least because few of them are on Italian paper. However from the evidence of selected drawings to be presented here (Figs. 17-22 and 24-26), it is clear that several were made in Italy c. 1795-98 and are connected with Ottley's published work from that time. On the other hand, a large part of the portfolio consists of drawings loosely inspired by Italian mannerists from Michelangelo to Parmi- gianino, many showing elegant figures sketching or with musical instruments, and which have not been associated with any documented design by Ottley. And some if not all of this group (for which see further note 16 below) appear to date from shortly before Ottley's Italian journey. Recent conservation work, initiated by Anthony Mould, has revealed the date 1790, inscribed in ink by the artist, on the reverse of several of the drawings. 6 Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 11, Sculpture, p. 66. 7 Ingamells 1997, pp. 728 and 973.

It turned up on the London art market in the early 1970s and was acquired by John Appleby. One of the first scholars to study the Ottley Portfolio was Christopher Lloyd, who in 1975 was instrumental in extracting for acquisition by the Ashmolean Museum two impor- tant drawings, catalogued here under nos. 10 and 76. I thank Christopher for his generosity in encouraging me to follow up this material. From time to time after 1975, other drawings were extracted from the portfolio and sold, most notably at Sotheby's London, 19 October 1989. Fortunately these were photographed by the Paul Mellon Centre, London, and I have also been able to trace many of them to the collections of well-known art historians. All ninety-five drawings that can be identified and associated with the Appleby portfolio are catalogued here in Part I. I would like to thank Mr Appleby for his generosity in giving me access to his collection, over an extended period of time; also all the private collectors whose infectious enthusiasm for Ottley and for this project enabled me to extend this enquiry. During my time in Italy as Paul Mellon Fellow (2001) at the British School, Rome, I was also able to study Ottley drawings in the Vatican Library and at the Accademia, Venice. The drawings by or after Ottley at the Vatican throw light on his relationship with Séroux d'Agincourt; some had been noted by Henri Loyrette in his footnotes to a seminal article on the French writer in Revue de LyArt in 1980, and they are now fully catalogued here in Part II under Séroux d'Agincourt Collection. Drawings by Ottley that found their way to the collection of his friend, the Dutch artist, Humbert de Superville (1770-1849), with whom he collaborated closely, and which are now at the Accademia, Venice, are catalogued here in Part III under Humbert de Superville Collection. However, the extensive corpus of drawings at Venice, which are attributed to Humbert de Superville himself and which were first addressed by Giovanni Previtali (1964) and Anna Maria Petrioli (1964), have been fully catalogued and illustrated by Annalisa Perissa Torrini (1991) to whose work I constantly refer. Unfortunately I have failed to find any written journals compiled by Ottley during his travels. I succeeded in tracing his descendants who assure me they have nothing. Thus it is largely from Ottley's graphic work that we may track the course of his artistic interests in Italy. 371</page><page sequence="374">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE PART I: OTTLEY COLLECTION A CATALOGUE OF DRAWINGS ASSEMBLED BY WILLIAM YOUNG OTTLEY FOR HIS A SERIES OF PLATES ENGRAVED AFTER THE PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURES OF THE MOST EMINENT MASTERS OF THE EARLY FLORENTINE SCHOOL ; INTENDED TO ILLUSTRATE THE HISTORY OF THE RESTORATION OF THE ARTS OF DESIGN IN ITALY; AND DEDICATED TO JOHN FLAXMAN, ESQ. R.A. PROFESSOR OF SCULPTURE TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY , (IN TOKEN OF HIGH RESPECT FOR HIS GENIUS), LONDON, 1826 ASSISI Assisi and its art lay well outside the Grand Tourist itinerary, both for the French and British traveller. Richardson 1722, Cochin 1758, Northall 1766, Lalande 1769, Martyn 1787, all virtually ignored it. It was only in the early nineteenth century that writers such as Carl von Rumohr, Alexis Rio and Lord Lindsay went there specially to admire the frescoes in the Basilica of S. Francesco and to study their iconography. Séroux d'Agincourt deserves credit for his seminal role in commissioning copies at Assisi from a team of artists that included Ottley and the Italian artist, Carlo Cencione. Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli played a leading part in assembling the varied mate- rial for publication in a number of composite plates (cf. Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, v, pl. CX; vi, pl. CXVI) and making engraver's outline copies. Tommaso Piroli is credited as the principal engraver. As Séroux d'Agincourt acknowledged (1, p. ii): Les planches de la Sculpture et de la Peinture l'ont été par Thomas Piroli, l'un des meilleurs graveurs romains, et par Giacomo Macchiavelli qui, de plus, en a fait seul tous les dessins avec une patience et une intelligence auxquelles j'ai deja rendu plusieurs fois, et je me plais encore à render ici la plus entière justice. Humbert de Superville was also at Assisi with Ottley in 1792-93, and making copies; but there is no clear evidence that he was directly employed by Séroux d'Agincourt. The Ottley Collection contains numerous drawings that he retained, by or attributed to Ottley after Cimabue and Cimabue followers in the upper church, and after Cavallini, Pietro Lorenzetti, the Master of St. Francis, the Master of the S. Nicola chapel, Simone Martini and Andrea de' Bartoli, all in the lower church. Moreover he and Cencione appear to have copied all the scenes of the St. Francis Legend in the upper church, although only one drawing, The Dream of Innocent III , has been traced. There is surprisingly little by Ottley from Assisi in the Séroux d'Agincourt archive at the Vatican, and some of the drawings that can be located there appear to be repetitions of material that Ottley retained (see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, below, Cat. nos. 1-4). It would appear that from the outset Ottley had an undeclared ambition to reuse the material he gathered for Séroux d'Agincourt in his own volume, later published in 1826. Ottley's book includes six scenes from the Legend of St Francis engraved by Piroli from Ottley or Cencione drawings dating from 1792-93 (pls. XII-XVII); The Nativity by a Cimabue follower / the Master of the Capture of Christ, engraved by Piroli after an Ottley drawing (pl. VIII); The Burial of Christ by Pietro Lorenzetti, engraved by Piroli again after Ottley (pl. XXIV); The Lamentation over the dead Christ , by the Master of St. Francis, which Ottley copied and engraved himself (pl. IV); St. Nicholas restores 372</page><page sequence="375">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Adeodatus to his parents which again Ottley copied and engraved (pl. XXV). Later Séroux would object to Ottley's appropriation of this material for publication in 1826 on a far grander scale than had been possible in the French corpus, published in 1810-23.

Figures larger than life Copied from the upper part of the north wall of the nave, in the bay nearest the transept crossing, in the upper church of S. Francesco. The fresco is the first of a series of sixteen scenes from the Old Testament, arranged in two registers, dating from the late thirteenth century, and associated with Cimabue by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), i, p. 240; (Milanesi 1878-85), 1, pp. 252-53. Guglielmo Della Valle, in the edition of Vasari that Ottley was using, adds a footnote questioning the attribution to Cimabue of all the Old Testament scenes: 'Dalla maniera diversa notabilmente di queste pitture, io non le attribuisco tutte a Cimabue.' See further Della Valle 1782, 1, p. 254, who criticizes Vasari's connoisseurship: Vasari attribuisce a Cimabue le maggior parte delle pitture della Chiesa superiore di Assisi; ma basta avere una piccola idea del disegno, e della maniera di lui, e di Giotto suo scolaro per avvedersi del contrario; si distinguono le maniere progressive di Giunta, di Cimabue, di Giotto e di Giottino, che vi dipinsero. Cimabue è quello che vi fa peggior comparsa. Regna nelle sue pitture una stucchevole monotonia; nè si distinguono le carnagioni dal fondo del legno, o del muro, fu cui sono dipinte; le figure pajono infilzate, i tratti del viso sono grossolani come quelli degli orsi, de'satiri; . . . Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, 11, pp. 623-24, attributes the three Genesis bays, beginning with The Creation , to Jacopo Torriti. This scene is illustrated by Poeschke 1985, pl. 116; see also Bonsanti 2002, pl. 776, no. 1604 as by Roman masters. A simplified version of this notably vigorous and broadly executed drawing is in the Séroux d'Agincourt archive at the Vatican, Vat. Lat. 9843, f. 59r; Séroux d'Agincourt Collection Cat. no. 3 below; see Loyrette 1980, p. 54, note 106, pl. 20. Executed in pen and ink, apparently as an autograph repetition of the present sheet, it was incorporated into the reproductive engraving reproduced in Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, v, pl. CX, no. 2 as by Cimabue; see also in, p. 128, where d'Agincourt explicitly credits Ottley for making the drawing. This scene was not engraved for Ottley nor reproduced in his 1826 volume. 2. W. Y.

W. Y. O. d ' 1 792 373</page><page sequence="376">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE The scene copied in this drawing forms part of a series of sixteen New Testament scenes from the Annunciation to the Resurrection, covering the upper registers of the south wall of the nave in the upper church of S. Francesco. The present scene is from the second bay from the west end. Traditionally attributed to Cimabue; see Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), i, p. 240; (Milanesi 1878-85), 1, pp. 252-53. It is now given by some (see Palumbo 1969, pl. 17) to the Master of the Capture of Christ (another scene in the series); but cf. Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, p. 624, as by a Cimabue follower; and Bonsanti 2002, 11, p. 806, no. 1633, as by Roman masters. This image was engraved by Piroli as pl. VIII in Ottley 1826, where the drawing after Cimabue is credited to Ottley and dated 1792. It was also reproduced in Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, v, pl. CX, no. 3, as Cimabue; this print too probably derives from the present or else another similar Ottley drawing. Ottley 1823, pp. 6-7, wrote an extended and enthusiastic analysis of Cimabue's work in the upper church at Assisi, in which he refers to the Old and New Testament scenes on the walls (as well as the ceiling figures of the Evangelists and Doctors of the Church) as follows: Notwithstanding the manifold deficiencies of these works in whatever relates to the executive depart- ments of painting, and more especially the absence of almost every principle of claire-obscure, and their gross faultiness of perspective, a certain simple grandeur and boldness of style are every where apparent in them: the general outline and proportions of the figures are good; the heads, though rudely drawn, are characteristic and expressive, and the draperies are so finely cast as to justify the supposition that Cimabue was not wholly unacquainted with the productions of antiquity. These qualities, especially the expressive heads and the deep folds of the drapery, are well conveyed in this drawing. The naivety of the depiction of the animals accurately reflects the original fresco. 3. W. Y.

Assisi. W.Y. O. del1, ab Orig. 1792 Since the present drawing was made, the badly damaged fresco that it reproduces appears to have deteriorated, especially in the foreground. It is placed on the middle register of the south wall of the nave of the upper church of S. Francesco, four bays from the west end. Traditionally attrib- uted to Cimabue; see Vasari 1568 (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 253. The fresco is now credited to his followers; see Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, p. 624. However see further Vasari 1568 (Bottari Sc Della Valle 1791-94), 1, p. 240, the particular edition that Ottley habitually used, and where Guglielmo Della Valle, in a footnote, attributes some of those frescoes as well as those of the vault to Giotto. See further Della Valle 1782, 1, pp. 254-55. See also Bonsanti 2002, pl. 826, no. 1653 as Giotto and followers. The present drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826, although the neighbour- ing scene of The Deposition was included, plate IX, as after Cimabue, based on a lost Ottley draw- ing. However both scenes, together with a detail, were engraved for Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, v, pl. CX, nos. 4, 5 and 7. He credits Ottley with the drawings but these are no longer in the 374</page><page sequence="377">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Vatican archive; see Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 1, p. 128, under no. CX. The present drawing, or more probably a close replica, would have served this purpose. The Séroux d'Agincourt plate of The Holy Women at the Empty Tomb (Fig. 1) appears to reproduce much of the detail and most of the nuances in this drawing, as well as the extended area of damage recorded in the additional piece at the top. Ottley 1823, pp. 5-7, wrote at length about Cimabue's work in the upper church at Assisi, including the scenes from the Old and New Testament (for which see also Cat. nos. 1 and 2 above), and specifically singles out The Deposition described above: A series of dignified representations, calculated to elevate the mind to devotion, or impress it with religious awe, was the object of the painter; and this object he has attained in an eminent degree. Each of the pictures is expressive of its subject; nor would it be difficult to point out amongst them examples of invention and composition worthy the more advanced periods of the art. In one of them, particularly, in which the artist has represented the dead body of our Saviour, surrounded by the Maries, Saint John, and other disciples, the whole forms a group at once so pathetic and beautiful as to leave little to be desired, save that perfection of execution which the labours of three succeeding centuries were found not more than adequate to accomplish. He goes on to take issue with Della Valle (see above) over his attribution of these frescoes to Giotto: To the manner of Giotto they bear no similitude, but are evidently the productions of one who received the principles of his art from Greek preceptors; and, allowing for the necessary difference between fresco and distemper painting, resemble in their style the other known works of Cimabue. Nor should I omit to add in this place, that, though Cimabue was, in most parts of the art, far excelled by Giotto his pupil, it has not fallen to my lot to meet with any work of the latter artist, in which a naked figure is so correctly drawn as that of the dead Christ in the picture of Cimabue above mentioned If Giotto was the Raffaelle of his day, Cimabue was the Michelangiolo.

On the verso a graphite drawing of some church railings This drawing records the fresco from the upper register of the west wall of the south transept of the upper church of S. Francesco. It has been associated with Cimabue and his workshop, ever since Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), i, p. 240; (Milanesi 1878-85), 1, pp. 252-53. See Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictonary of Art 1996, 11, p. 622; Bonsanti 2002, pl. 989, no. 1888, as Cimabue. The scene was engraved in Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, v, pl. CX no. 1; and Ottley is credited for the drawing by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, in, p. 128, under no. CX. However, the print is a feeble reflection of the present remarkably expressive and dynamic drawing with its more vigorous technique, especially in the agitated outline of the dragon and the frenzied hatching of the damaged area in the background. Thus it seems likely that Séroux d'Agincourt was sent a far more schematic version, now lost, of the present drawing which Ottley retained. Ottley's copy was not engraved for reproduction in his 1826 volume. A drawing of the figure of St. Michael alone was made by Humbert de Superville, probably at the same time; this drawing, inscribed Gio. Cimabue. Assisi , remained in his own collection (Venice Accademia, inv. 1295; Torrini 1991, cat. no. 23). 5. W. Y.

W.Y.O. delt. ab Orig. 1792 Prov: Appleby; Professor John White who presented it to University College, London, 1996 (ESDC 4950) The fresco cycle of twenty-eight scenes from the Legend of St. Francis was traditionally attributed to Giotto since Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 80; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 377; although Della Valle added a note suggesting that not all were actually by him. However, they were accepted as such by Ottley 1823, pp. 10- 1 1. The project is now associated with the Roman-trained Master of the Legend of St. Francis who probably planned and supervised the execution of the entire cycle and himself painted scenes II to XIX. The sixth scene, recorded here, placed on the north wall, second bay down from the west end (Bonsanti 2002, pl. 844, no. 1673), was not reproduced in Ottley 1826. However, six other scenes from the cycle were reproduced there, engraved by Piroli after lost drawings by Ottley and Cencione, all dated 1792 or 1793. See Ottley 1826, pls. XII- XVII. Ottley, in 1808-23, pp. 9-10, comments on Giotto's sensitivity to human expressions, as well as his powers of invention and composition in this fresco cycle. Although Ottley's drawing captures the tonal values of the original fresco and the folds and modelling of the draperies, as well as accurately delineating areas of damage, he develops his own shorthand for depicting the repetitive pattern of the curtains in the background. All the lost drawings by Cencione and Ottley connected with this fresco cycle were very probably similar in 376</page><page sequence="379">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE scale and detail to the present drawing and far less schematic than the composite drawing in Séroux d'Agincourt's archive at the Vatican, Vat.

A print based on this drawing is reproduced by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CXVI. In the meantime Séroux d'Agincourt appears to have been upset by Ottley's independent initia- tive to publish some of the drawings on a much larger scale, thereby upstaging his own publication. As he wrote, 1810-23, in, p. 131: Les dessins de ces peintures, qui étaient inedites, m'ont été communiqués par M. Ottley, peintre anglais, qui, en 1793 et 1794, en a fait une étude particulière, et qui, n'ignorant pas l'usage que j'en fais dans cette histoire de la décadence de l'Art, a cru cependant pouvoir les publier, en les gravant en grand; c'est un ouvrage de plus à ajouter à ceux de ce genre, qui, mis au jour depuis quelques années, en France, en Italie, en Angleterre et en Allemagne doivent au mien leur naissance. 6.

Francesco, representing St. Francis and the Simpleton (Bonsanti 2002, pl. 833, no. 1659), placed at the top (west end) of the nave, on the north wall. The other three figures are taken from St. Francis Expels the Devils from Arezzo (Bonsanti 2002, pl. 852, no. 1683), located in the fourth bay fom the west, on the north wall. These figures were not reproduced in Ottley 1826. However, each of these figures is included in a composite drawing in the Séroux d'Agincourt MSS, Vat. Lat. 9843, f. 7 ir which is inscribed Inglese ved. and which was probably arranged and executed by an engraver, such as Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli, employed by Séroux d'Agincourt, and working from further drawings, now lost, supplied by Ottley; see below Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 1. This Vatican drawing shows these details, and others, incon- gruously juxtaposed with a section from the vault of the lower church at Assisi, depicting the Obedience of St. Francis , by the Giottesque Master of the Vaults, as well as six complete scenes from the St. Francis legend in the upper church. An engraving based on this drawing, but with some rearrangement, was published in Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CXVI. 7. W. Y.

The stained glass dates from c. 1275 and has been attributed variously to a Roman studio and to the Master of St. Francis (see Bonsanti 2002, pl. 105 1 and pl. 1058, no. 2095) who was responsible for the St. Francis fresco cycles in the nave of the lower church; see V. Kaufmann, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, pp. 631-32, fig. 7. The windows of the north transept are focused on the Appearance of Angels , and of Christ after his Resurrection , including The Ascension. Ottley's drawing was not engraved for publication in his 1826 volume. ASSISI, BASILICA OF S. FRANCESCO, LOWER CHURCH 9. W. Y. Ottley as after Pietro Cavallini [Pietro Lorenzetti] The three Maries and other figures at the Crucifixion Black ink over grey wash over graphite; 380 x 3 10 Inscribed in ink below: Group in the lower part of the picture of the Crucifixion by Pietro Cavallini / in the lower Church of the Convent of St. Francis in Assisi/ WY.O. dt. ab Orig. 1793 Prov: Appleby; sold Sotheby's, London, 19 October 1989; David B. Brown The drawing records a detail from the monumental Crucifixion by Pietro Lorenzetti on the east wall of the south arm of the transept of the lower church of S. Francesco, Assisi. The earlier attribution of this fresco to Pietro Cavallini, which was followed by Ottley, originates from Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 199; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 540. The attribution to Lorenzetti is due to Crowe and Cavalcaseli 1864, 11, p. 128. The fresco was damaged by the inser- tion of an altarpiece in 1604/05, below the Crucified Christ and to the right of the three Maries; although this was removed in 1870/71, the damage and paint loss was permament. For the present appearance of the scene see Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, 11, p. 626, fig. 5; and Macginnis 2001, p. 153, fig. 41. See further Bonsanti 2002, pl. 462, no. 947 as Pietro Lorenzetti. 378</page><page sequence="381">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE An almost identical drawing of the same detail with the three Maries and two horses, made with pen and ink, with grey wash and graphite, 296 X 217, is in the Humbert de Superville collection at Venice (inv. 1297); it is inscribed in de Superville's hand: Pietro Cavallini/ in S. Francesco Assisi. See below, Humbert de Superville Collection, Cat. no. 1. See also Torrini 1991, p. 32, cat. no. 25, illus., as by Humbert de Superville; Previtali 1962, p. 38, and 1964, pl. 54, as by Humbert de Superville. This drawing was almost certainly copied from Ottley's drawing rather than the fresco, either by Ottley as a gift for de Superville who then inscribed it with artist's name and location, or by de Superville himself from Ottley's drawing presented here. The Venice drawing, although slightly more schematic than the one from Ottley's Collection, with less detail in the delineation of the horses, for instance, is arguably closer in style of execution to Ottley than de Superville, especially in the bold, expressive, colouristic use of wash. A third version of this drawing may have been sent to Séroux d'Agincourt who reproduces the very same detail from the overall composition, under 1810-23, vi, pl. CXXV, no. 3, as after Cavallini. However, no such drawing has come to light in the Vatican archive. The present drawing was not reproduced by Ottley 1826, but he did reproduce the upper half of the fresco with Christ on the Cross with flying angels, as pl. XXII, based on his own, now lost, drawing, said there to date from 1792. From this drawing de Superville again takes Ottley's accurate representation of the flying angels, copies them but then rearranges them on the sheet as a medley of his own, inscribed Pietro Cavallini - Assisi, followed by detailed colour notes in French, which strongly suggests his own familiarity with the original fresco as well; Venice inv. 1269, see Torrini 1991, p. 32, cat. no. 24, illus. Séroux d'Agincourt also reproduces four of these angels, under 1810-23, VI&gt; pi- CXXV, no. 4, a plate that was probably independently rearranged by his editor, although no connected drawing by either Ottley or Humbert de Superville or any other artist has surfaced at the Vatican archive. Séroux d'Agincourt, in, p. 137, goes on to cite Vasari's description of these figures, an account which may very well have inspired the Ottley and de Superville drawings and the reproductive prints. Vasari (ibid.) wrote as follows: In aria fece alcuni Angeli, che, fermati in su l'ali in diverse attitudini, piangono dirottamente; e stringen- dosi alcuni le mani al petto, altri incrociandole e altri battendosi le palme, mostrano avere estremo dolore della morte del figliuolo di Dio; e tutti dal mezzo indietro, ovvero dal mezzo in giù, sono convertiti in aria. io.

For the subsequent attribution to Pietro Lorenzetti, see Crowe and Cavalcaselle 1864, 11, p. 129; see further Bonsanti 2002, pl. 467, no. 952. This highly expressive drawing was engraved by Piroli and reproduced in Ottley 1826, pl. XXIV. Some damage in the background of the fresco, especially around the haloes, is not recorded in this careful copy, similar in style to Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 9 above, and may have occurred later. Ottley 1826, pl. XXIII, also reproduces the preceding scene, Christ taken down from the Cross , on the other side of the window on the south wall, in an engraving by Piroli made from his own, now lost, drawing. 11.

XXIII (see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 10 above). Ottley follows the attribution to Puccio Capanna, based on Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 104; (Milanesi 1878-85), 1, p. 404. However, this fresco is now attributed to Pietro Lorenzetti; see Berenson 1968, 1, p. 218 and illus. II, pl. 80; Bonsanti 2002, pl. 477, no. 964. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced by Ottley. 12. W. Y. Ottley as after Greek artists, assisted by Cimabue [Master of St. Francis] The Lamentation over the dead Christ Pen and black ink with heavy grey wash; 240 x 284 Inscribed in black ink, below, in Ottley's hand: Picture in Frescoe by the Greeks , assisted by Cimabue then working under them , in the lower Church of the Convent of / St. Francis. Assisi : W.Y. O. del ' 1792. ab Orig. The drawing records part of a damaged fresco, abruptly cut off at the right, from the upper section of the north side of the nave in the lower church of S. Francesco, Assisi, at the entrance to the chapel of S. Antonio. Attributed to Cimabue by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), i, p. 239; (Milanesi 1878-85), 1, p. 252, it is now attributed to the Master of St. Francis (active c. 1260 and influenced by Giunta Pisano and Byzantine art) who was also responsible for the five scenes from the life of St. Francis occupying the corresponding area of the south wall. For the artist, see further Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, pp. 621-22; also Bonsanti 2002, pl. 220, no. 314. Ottley's drawing, which he himself engraved, was published, 1826, no. IV, as by Greek Artists, The Masters of Cimabue. Ottley there comments: It is to be regretted that part of this painting was destroyed about the year 1300, upon the occasion of certain chapels being added to the sides of the church. The figure of the Madonna, notwithstanding the rude manner in which it is executed, is admirable for the attitude and expression. 380</page><page sequence="383">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE In both his drawing and the print Ottley omits the landscape of rocks and trees now visible in the fresco, above the mourning Maries and again at the lower left. The drawing emphasizes the expres- sive Byzantine forms of the figures, the strong modelling of their draperies and their emotional intensity. 13. W. Y. Ottley as after Tomaso Stefano called Giottino [Master of the S. Nicola Chapel] St Nicholas throws gold bars to the three poor children Pen and black ink, with grey wash; 260 x 215 Inscribed in black ink, 1.1., in Ottley's hand: WYã O. dt. ab Orig. 1793 • / Frescoe by Tomasso Stefano called Giottino , in the Chapel of St. Nicholas in the lower Church of / the Convent of St Francis-Assisi A copy from one of the scenes from the life of St. Nicholas in the chapel of S. Nicola, which is situated off the north transept of the lower church of S. Francesco, Assisi. By 1306 this chapel was decorated with ten episodes of a cycle illustrating the saint's charity and miracles, taken from Jacopo da Voragine. Ottley follows the mistaken attribution to Giottino, made by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 260; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 627, and based on a confusion with the neighbouring chapel. The St. Nicholas paintings are now attributed to the Master of the S. Nicola chapel (fl. 1295-1305), a Giottesque artist influenced by the St. Francis cycle in the upper church; see Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, p. 625; also Bonsanti 2002, pl. 588, no. 1237. For another unpublished pen drawing (inv. 13 18) of the same scene, also by Ottley, without the addition of wash, see the Humbert de Superville Collection, Cat. no. 3 below. Humbert de Superville, in his turn, appears to have made a record of one detail from the scene, the sleeping figures on the ground (inv. 1296), perhaps working from Ottley's study, rather than the original fresco. It is inscribed by de Superville: Tommaso Stefano detto Giottino/ Assisi; see Torrini 1991, p. 33, cat. no. 26. This impression of a copy made from a copy is reinforced by the inclusion on the same sheet of a copy after a detail from a fresco by Ugolino di Prete Ilario at Orvieto; it is inscribed: Duomo. Orvieto. Ottley's drawing was not engraved or reproduced in his 1826 volume. However, another scene from the cycle was engraved and reproduced; see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 14 below. 14. W. Y.

XXV. 381</page><page sequence="384">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Ottley's copy ignores the pattern on the murky green wall above the figures. He also misses the abstract beauty of the still-life elements on the table in the original fresco. The emphasis is firmly on the human drama and the facial expressions of the figures. 15. W. Y.

Francesco, Assisi. It represents the Virgin and Child with two royal saints; on the adjoining wall five saints complete the ensemble. The present drawing is a copy of one of these. The frescoes which may date from immediately after the cycle of frescoes in the S. Martino chapel off the south side of the nave of the lower church, are accepted as the work of Simone Martini by Martindale 1988, p. 173, cat. no. 3. pl. 48; for the Male Saint holding a lily see p. 173, no. 3, pls. 46 &amp; 48. See further Adrian Hoch, in the Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, p. 627; Bonsanti 2002, pl. 555, no. 115$ as St. Emericus. Ottley's drawing shows more detail in the tooling of the halo and the edges of the drapery, including the collar, than is visible today in the fresco. The saint's eyes are also copied with notable precision. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. 16. W. Y. Ottley as after an unknown artist [Andrea de' Bartoli] The Agony in the Garden Black chalk, traces of pen and black ink; 210 x 155 Inscribed in ink, 1.1., in Ottley's hand: Picture in Frescoe / in the lower Church of / the Convent of St Francis /Assisi / NB.

Lorenzo, off the north side of the nave, between the chapels dedicated to S. Ludovico and S. Antonio di Padova, in the lower church of S. Francesco, Assisi. See Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, p. 628; and Bonsanti 2002, pl. 321, no. 540 and pl. 323, no. 542. See further under Cat. no. 17 below. Ottley notes on the drawing that part of the design to the right had been whitewashed out and draws a dotted line along the right edge to make this clear. This probably included the standing male figure to the right of the composition, reproduced, as now partially damaged, by Bonsanti, loc. cit., but absent from Ottley's drawing. Ottley also excludes the heavy brown vegetation against white earth, visible today in the middleground. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. 382</page><page sequence="385">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE 17. W. Y. Ottley as after an unknown artist [Andrea de' Bartoli] St. Catharine and the Miracle of the Wheel Pen and black ink and grey wash; 286 x 236 Inscribed in black ink, below, in Ottley's hand: Picture in Frescoe in the Chappel of St Cathariney in the lower Church of the Convent of St. Francis , Assisi/ IVY. O. dt. ab Orig.ijg2 The fresco copied here is one of twelve scenes painted by Andrea de' Bartoli from the life of St. Catharine, in the chapel of S. Caterina in the entrance transept at the north end of the lower church of S. Francesco, Assisi. The scene represented here lies to the left of the altar. See Bonsanti 2002, I, p. 164, no. 184. Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 174; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 507, attributed these frescoes to Buffalmacco. Ottley gives no attribution. It was not until 191 1 that documents recording a payment to Andrea da Bologna in 1367 led to the present attribution to Andrea de' Bartoli. Ottley appears to have responded wholeheartedly to what Adrian Hoch (in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, pp. 627-28), has characterized as the artist's 'expressionistic, stridently coloured style'. This is one of the most striking drawings he made at Assisi, with its bold use of wash to dramatize the chiaroscuro, and the technique of scratching away the wash to indicate a cloud beneath the flying angel who chases away the men tumbling out of the composition on the right. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. Humbert de Superville, apparently independently to judge from minor variations, made his own drawing after the angel brandishing a sword at the top of the composition; this is now preserved among his collection at Venice Accademia (inv. 1270). As Torrini 1991, p. 31, cat. no. 22, observes, it records one of the scenes 'che nella loro violenza e terribilità maggiormente colpiscono la fantasia dell'autore e il suo spirito vicino al gusto preromantico'. 18.

The present drawings were not engraved or reproduced either by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23 or by Ottley 1826. FLORENCE Florence was an essential component of the Grand Tour. Throughout the eighteenth century tour- ists were familiar with the old master paintings and antique sculpture in the Tribuna of the Uffizi, where they would compare the respective beauties of the Venus de Medici and Titian's Venus of Urbino. They appreciated the Renaissance sculpture by Cellini and Giambologna in the Loggia dei Lanzi; the Ghiberti doors on the Baptistery; the interior of the Duomo; the Donatello pulpits in S. Lorenzo, and the Michelangelo tombs in the Medici chapel or Sagrestia Nuova of S. Lorenzo. However, the medieval churches, such as S. Croce, S. Maria Novella, and S. Maria del Carmine, although mentioned by travel writers such as Lalande and Martyn, were not seriously explored, and the altarpieces and frescoes of the early Italian artists including Cimabue, Giotto, Taddeo Gaddi and Fra Angelico did not receive the critical attention they deserved. Flaxman, on his visit to Florence in 1787, documented in the Fitzwilliam Journal and the Yale Sketchbook, both published in this volume, made notes on Cimabue, Giotto, Gaddi, Orcagna and Fra Angelico. And he made copies of the Ghiberti reliefs on the north portal of the Baptistery and of the Michelangelo tombs in the Medici chapel. On subsequent visits, in 1791 and 1794, well documented in two Sketchbooks at the V&amp;A, he made copies of reliefs by Tino di Camaino on the tomb of Gastone della Torre in S. Croce, and after frescoes by Uccello in the Chiostro Verde at S. Maria Novella. Above all he focused on copying sculpture: Donatello's pulpits in S. Lorenzo; Cellini and Giambologna in the Loggia dei Lanzi; Michelangelo's Lamentation in the Duomo, as well as the same artist's tombs in the Medici chapel. However, it was Ottley, working for Séroux d'Agincourt, accompanied in 1798 by the Dutch painter, Humbert de Superville, and the Italian engraver Tommaso Piroli, whose efforts signifi- cantly advanced the appreciation of the early Florentine painters who had worked in the city. The choice of artists/subjects probably owed more to study of Italian sources, particularly Vasari, than to the tourist guides and Grand Tour travel literature. Ottley is recorded in Florence in 1792 and 1798 and might well have made other visits in between. He began by copying, for Séroux d'Agincourt, Michelangelo's Lamentation in the Duomo; the Medici Tombs in the Sagrestia Nuova of S. Lorenzo and The Awakening Slave, now in the Accademia collection. These drawings are in the Séroux d'Agincourt Collection at the Vatican, and are catalogued here in Part II below; all but one are dated February 1792. Possibly on a later visit Ottley, together with Humbert de Superville, copied details from the Andrea Pisano doors on the south portal of the Baptistery. Ottley also made detailed studies from the Ghiberti doors on the north portal; and even copied two of Flaxman' s sketches, of Ghiberti's Agony in the Garden and The Transfiguration, although it is not clear if this was done with Flaxman in situ and if so when, or alternatively, and perhaps more probably, completed later on at Rome. On his final visit to Florence in 1798 he made copies after Agnolo Gaddi in the choir of S. Croce, as well as in the Rinuccini chapel and Sacristy; and he acquired, probably on his own initiative and with his forthcoming volume of engravings in mind, 385</page><page sequence="388">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE further drawings by Humbert de Superville and Tommaso Piroli, made in the same chapel, after frescoes by Giovanni da Milano and panels from an Armadio by Taddeo Gaddi which at that time were attributed to Giotto. This team also worked together during 1798 at S. Maria Novella, in the choir (Domenico Ghirlandaio), the Spanish Chapel (Andrea da Firenze), the Strozzi chapel (Filippino Lippi) and the Chiostro Verde (Uccello). However, Ottley does not appear to have been involved in copying the vast Nardo di Cione fresco of Hell in the Strozzi chapel that was nevertheless illustrated by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CXIX. Finally Ottley and Piroli worked in S. Maria del Carmine copying frescoes by Masaccio and Filippino Lippi; the drawings are lost but reproductive prints were published in Ottley 1826, pls. XLIII and XLIV. If Ottley made detailed notes during his travels and his copying campaigns, they have not yet been found. Later he wrote perceptively and sympathetically about the early Florentine artists in his own illustrated and pioneering volumes published in 1823 and 1826. FLORENCE, BAPTISTERY (SOUTH DOORS) 22.

An exact repetition of this drawing, in pen and ink with traces of graphite, 180 x 235, is in the Séroux d'Agincourt archive at the Vatican, Vat. Lat. 9846, f. 6v. It is inscribed in ink, U.I., in Ottley's hand: on one of the Gates to the Baptistery Florence from the design of Giotto. This would suggest the Vatican drawing was supplied by Ottley, probably by copying directly from the present drawing still preserved in his Collection. For the Vatican drawing, see below under Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 5. The drawing is not dated. Neither Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23 nor Ottley 1826 reproduced this design. These designs, which develop and adapt the principles of monumental painting developed by Giotto to the medium of relief sculpture, are notable for their well-balanced compositions and the arrangement of the figures in a succession of planes. (See further G. Kreytenberg, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxiv, pp. 874-75). This clarity of design, as well as the plastic sculptural quality of the figures in relief, is conveyed with succinct economy by Ottley in these pen drawings. 23. Attributed to W. Y.

Humbert de Superville after Andrea Pisano Transporting the body of St. John the Baptist ; The Burial of St. John the Baptist Pen and black ink; 332 X 479 Prov: Appleby; Sotheby's, London 19 October 1989; Andrew Wilton The drawing records two scenes from the right door, left and right tiers, third register from the bottom of Andrea Pisano's doors for the Baptistery, Florence; see Kreytenberg 1984, pp. 19-34, pls. 20 and 21; also Moskowitz 1986, pp. 7-30, pls. 24 and 25. This highly finished drawing by Humbert de Superville marks an advanced stage in the prepara- tion of the reproductive print, which he also engraved, for publication in Ottley 1826, pl. XI, where the drawing is dated 1798. The earlier stages of Humbert de Superville's work recording these relief sculptures were retained by the artist in his own collection, now at the Accademia, Venice. In connection with the Transporting the Body of St. John, there is a rapid sketch in graphite (Venice inv. 1263; Torrini 1991, p. 45, cat. no. 43); a composition study in pen and ink and graphite (inv. 1284, Torrini 1991, p. 45, cat. no. 44); a copy or tracing of inv. 1284 in pen and wash on oiled tracing paper (inv. 1262, Torrini 1991, p. 46, cat. no. 45). For The Burial of St. John we have a sequence comprising a composition study in pen and ink and grey wash on oiled tracing paper (inv. 1283, Torrini 1991, p. 47, cat. no. 47) which was then copied or traced in another drawing, in pen and ink on oiled tracing paper (inv. 1261, Torrini 1991, p. 48, cat. no. 48). The present drawing moves beyond concern with the outline and design to incorporate a more elaborate pattern of shading, especially in the treatment of draperies, an interest also reflected in a dedicated drapery study executed in graphite, at Venice (inv. 1355, Torrini 1991, p. 46, cat. no. 46; see also Toesca 1956, p. $3, fig. 1). This long sequence of drawings by Humbert de Superville, culminating in the present highly finished drawing in neo-classical style, which Ottley acquired, is the best surviving evidence of how de Superville refined his interpretation of a three dimensional relief sculpture and converted this into a medium suitable for reproductive engraving. FLORENCE, BAPTISTERY (NORTH DOORS) 25. W. Y. Ottley after Lorenzo Ghiberti The Nativity Pen and brown ink; 153 x 184 Inscribed in black ink, 1.1., in Ottley's hand: orig. WY.O. Inscribed below, in brown ink in the same hand: On one of the Gates of the Baptistery Florence. / Lorenzo Ghiberti 387</page><page sequence="390">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Copied from the left door, right tier, third register from the bottom of the north door of the Baptistery, Florence, by Lorenzo Ghiberti. Work on this door proceeded over an extended period from 1400-24. See Krautheimer 1970, pp. 103-06, pl. 27. The inscription implies that Ottley was working directly from the original, yet this drawing is virtually indistinguishable from the two drawings below (Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 26 and 27), also copies from the same door, where Ottley states he is working from a copy by Flaxman. Flaxman made copies of several scenes from this door, the majority during his stay in Florence in 1787 (see Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 4r), and most of these are in the Yale Sketchbook; however, see also V&amp;A 2790, f. 32r, Christ among the Doctors , which might be from a later visit. Flaxman's drawing of The Nativity (see Yale Sketchbook, f. 7r), in graphite, pen and ink, is perhaps taken from a higher and thus more level viewpoint than Ottley's, where the figures are seen at an angle from ground level and the faces, especially that of the Virgin Mary, are less visible. As Marchand, in his catalogue entry on f. 7, has suggested, Flaxman has transformed Ghiberti's compressed design into a more open pictorial image viewed head on, transforming the groundstrip in the foreground to a more horizontal axis. The copy is loosely structured, with little attention to the contours of the middleground, or details of the landcape. In contrast, Ottley's copy, of uncertain date (see above pp. 385-86), is less subjective, has more precision and clarity, a more geometrical sense of volume, and conveys more accurately the compressed space between figures and background and their spatial relationship in a bas-relief, by means of vigorous hatching behind the figures. Although the present drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826, it has the characteristics of a copy that was made for reproduction, whereas the Flaxman drawing represents an artist's attempt to edit and manipulate the design on the spot. 26. W. Y. Ottley after John Flaxman after Lorenzo Ghiberti The Agony in the Garden Pen and brush with brown ink; 151 X 185 Inscribed in brown ink, 1.1., in Ottley's hand: from Mr Flaxman's sketch Inscribed below, in black ink: On the same Gate And in brown ink: Lorenzo Ghiberti A copy from the left door, left tier, sixth register from the bottom, of the north door of the Baptistery, Florence, by Lorenzo Ghiberti, 1400-24; see Krautheimer 1970, pp. 107-12, pl. 43. The inscription on Ottley's drawing states that it was made from Flaxman's sketch, almost certainly the copy in the Yale Sketchbook, f. 8r, which probably dates from Flaxman's stay in Florence in 1787 (see Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 4r). Ottley might have seen this in Rome, any time from 1792; to judge from his copy of The Nativity , above, under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 25. He also studied the original door, probably in 1792 when he was working for Séroux d'Agincourt in the Medici chapel at S. Lorenzo, Florence, or 1793 when he is documented as having travelled to Orvieto, Assisi and Perugia, and might well have gone on to Florence. As in The Nativity above, Flaxman conveys a pictorial sense of figures in an ill defined open space; Ottley, in his version, closes down the scene, with vigorous hatching in the relatively shallow background, not present in the Flaxman prototype, but retains the tactile quality of the reliefs surface. This drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. 388</page><page sequence="391">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE 27. W. Y. Ottley after J. Flaxman after Lorenzo Ghiberti The Transfiguration Pen and grey ink and grey wash; 155 X 185 Inscribed in grey ink, 1.1., in Ottley 's hand: from Mr Flaxman' s sketch Inscribed in grey ink below, in same hand: On the same Gate. Lorenzo Ghiberti A copy from the left door, left tier, fifth register from the bottom, of the north door of the Baptistery, Florence, by Lorenzo Ghiberti, 1400-24; see Krautheimer 1970, pp. 103-12, pl. 37. A comparable drawing by Flaxman, probably dating from 1787 when he first visited Florence (see Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 4r), is in the Yale Sketchbook, f. i8r; and this is probably the drawing to which Ottley refers in the inscription on the present drawing. However, Ottley evidently also worked in front of the original Ghiberti door when he copied the scene of The Nativity , for which see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 25 above. Flaxman's drawing is similar to his copy of The Nativity , with an adjusted viewpoint and a correction to the foreshortened vertical axis when compared with the original bronze panel. See also Eckart Marchand under Yale Sketchbook, f. i8r. Ottley's copy is more precise, although here, unlike the two drawings described above, under Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 25 and 26, he does not close down the background with cross-hatching but instead, perhaps influenced by the tonal modelling of the crouching apostles in the foreground of Flaxman's drawing, adds grey washes to offset the figures in the bas-relief and to emphasize the shadows and folds of their drapery. This drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. FLORENCE, BAPTISTERY (EAST DOORS) 28. Anonymous artist, N.N., after Lorenzo Ghiberti The Story of Jacob and Esau Pen, black ink, and graphite, lightly squared with graphite; 366 X 375 Inscribed lower right in graphite: 35 This drawing records a scene from Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise, left door, third register from bottom, on the east doors of the Baptistery, Florence; see Krautheimer 1970, pp. 157-202, pl. 94. It was engraved by Piroli for reproduction in Ottley 1826, pl. XXXV, one of four scenes selected for the volume. It is there stated that the connected drawings date from 1799, and the artist is simply designated as N.N. (? non nomine). By this date celebrated plates of the Gates of Paradise had been published in Florence, half-life- size, by Ferdinando Gregori and Thomas Patch, in 1772; see F. Watson, in Walpole Society , xxvm, 1939-40, p. 46; and Borea 1993, pp. 65-68, pl. 25. In 1798 a further set of line engravings, incor- porating each of the individual scenes on the Gates, was published in Rome by H. Killer from drawings by Féodor Iwanowitsch, made from casts in the possession of Angelica Kauffmann (see Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 11, p. 79). There is no evidence to connect Ottley's commissions to N.N. and Piroli with any of these earlier initiatives. On the other hand, the present drawing, as well as Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 29 below, are close in style to Giovanni Battista Dell'Era, a friend of Angelica Kauffmann, who was based in Rome from the 1780s to 1790, and made copies after scenes from Ghiberti's Gate of Paradise which are now at the Castello Sforzesco, Milan, and the Biblioteca Civica at Treviglio; see Calbi 1986, pp. 121-25, pls. 88a, 88b, 89a, 89b. The drawing of Jacob and Esau , pl. 89a, from 389</page><page sequence="392">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Treviglio, is remarkably close in style to the present drawing of the same scene and shares its pronounced but delicate neo-classical emphasis on line. The same may be said of the drawing of Joseph and his brothers , at Treviglio, ibid., pl. 89b., when compared with Ottley's print, 1826, pl. XXXVI, for which the preparatory drawing has been lost. As Calbi 1986, p. 122, observes of the two Treviglio drawings: 'Nonostante il cattivo stato di conservazione ... i disegni evidenziano l'originalità di una visione che offre un'interpretazione in chiave rigorosamente neoclassica del capolavoro del Ghiberti.' The same observation applies to the matching drawings of Moses receiving the tablets of the law , and the Story of Noah , preserved at Milan. Further drawings of a similar type, in the Séroux d'Agincourt archive at the Vatican library, published by Loyrette 1980, as by Dell'Era, may instead, according to Calbi, all be copies after Dell'Era by Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli: The Miracle of the Strozzi boy , a relief from Lorenzo Ghiberti's shrine of St Zenobius in the Duomo, Florence, completed 1432-42; see Vat. Lat. 9840, f. 86r, 'signed' by Dell'Era, reproduced but misleadingly captioned by Loyrette 1980, p. 41, pl. 2; and two drawings, squared for transfer, from Ghiberti's Baptistery gate, Moses receiving the tablets of the Law (Vat. Lat. 9840, f. 84V), and The walls of Jericho (Vat. Lat. 9840, f. 85r), which are also attributed to Dell'Era, by Loyrette 1980, p. 41 and p. 51, note 24. The Moses receiving the tablets of the law , in particular, relates closely to the Dell'Era drawing of the same scene at the Castello Sforzesco, Milan, reproduced by Calbi 1986, pl. 88a. For a wider discussion of Macchiavelli's role as draughtsman for Séroux d'Agincourt, see further Calbi 1987. These three drawings at the Vatican were all engraved and reproduced together on a single sheet, by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, IV, pl. XLII, under nos. 1,3, and 5 respectively. Séroux d'Agincourt states (11, p. 79) that they were engraved in 1790, thus apparently predating the present drawing from Ottley's Collec- tion by nine years. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the enigmatic signature, N.N., one certainly cannot exclude the possibility that the present drawing, together with Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 29 below, is either by Dell'Era or Macchiavelli or another draughtsman from their circle. Certainly it shares the same distinctive and somewhat distorted and extreme neo-classical style. 29. Anonymous artist, N.N., after Lorenzo Ghiberti The Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon Pen and black and brown ink, graphite, lightly squared in graphite; 347 X 345 This anonymous drawing records a scene from Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise, right door, bottom register, on the east portal of the Baptistery, Florence; see Krautheimer 1970, pp. 157-202, pls. 116-17. It was engraved by Piroli for reproduction in Ottley 1826, pl. XXXVII, one of four scenes selected for the volume. It is there stated that the connected drawings date from 1799 and the artist is designated as N.N. (? non nomine). For a discussion of the attribution, and stylistic comparison with drawings both by the Bergamesque artist, Giovanni Battista Dell'Era, and by Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli who perhaps sometimes copied Dell'Era for Séroux d'Agincourt, see above under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 28 above.

The mosaic, which had been noted by Martyn 1787, p. 320, has become the stylistic focal point for a group of panels, reminiscent of Cimabue's style, and including a Virgin and Child at S. Remigio, Florence, that are now also attributed to Gaddo Gaddi (see Donatella Pagazzini, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xi, pp. 887-88). The drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826.

Croce, Florence, with Heraclius entering Jerusalem, part of a fresco cycle representing the Legend of the True Cross, painted by Agnolo Gaddi, 1388-93 (see Cole 1977, pp. 79-81, fig. 33, and Andrew Ladis, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xi, p. 892). The name of Agnolo Gaddi had been connected with the choir of S. Croce in all pre-Vasarian sources, as well as by Vasari himself; see Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), il, p. 271; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 637. In a footnote Della Valle (loc. cit.) added: Considerando io diligentemente gli avanzi di sodeste pitture, mi parve che Agnolo Gaddi abbia visibil- mente aggiunto all' arte non so che di meglio, che non si vede nelle opere di Giotto, di Simone, e degli altri maestri precedenti; e non vi è dubbio che, se egli averse operato in quella col medesimo studio e diligenza che vi pose Taddeo suo padre, si sarebbe appuntino verificato in esso il pronostico del Vasari. Martyn 1787, p. 326, also notes the fresco, but as by Taddeo Gaddi. The copy omits the foreground areas in lower left and lower right, and this apparently was out of choice since these areas were not obscured or damaged. In the inscription Ottley dates the draw- ing 1798, but mistakenly records the location as S. Maria Novella, where he was also working at this time together with Humbert de Superville and Piroli: an uncharacteristic error. The drawing was later engraved, apparently by Ottley himself, and reproduced in Ottley 1826, pl. XXX. The drawing is close in style to Humbert de Superville, in its precision, and the abstracted expressions of the figures. Humbert de Superville indeed was also present at S. Croce and he too copied a detail from this scene in 1798: a drawing, in black chalk and black ink, from his collection at the Accademia, Venice (inv. 1301), records two standing men at the bottom right, beyond the range of Ottley's study (see Torrini 1991, p. 64, cat. no. 78). 391</page><page sequence="394">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE FLORENCE, CHURCH OF S.

The fresco, c. 1365, may be by Matteo di Pacino (fi. 1360-74) who followed Giovanni da Milano (fi. 1346-69) after he had completed the top two registers of the cycle; see D. Gordon, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xn, p. 702; cf. also Berenson 1963, 1, p. 143, as Master of the Rinuccini Chapel. De Superville, probably misled by Vasari, believed the frescoes to be by Taddeo Gaddi; see Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791- 94), il, p. 222; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 572, note 2, with a long footnote explaining the fortuna critica of these frescoes until von Rumohr 1827 and Crowe and Cavalcaselle. The drawing may be attributed to Humbert de Superville, both on account of its contolled tight and delicate use of the pen and from comparison with the almost identical inscriptions ( Taddeo Gaddi ) found on drawings from his own collection, now at the Accademia, Venice; for instance, two figure studies from the very same fresco, one showing The Virgin going to the temple (inv. 1254), and another Two kneeling women (inv. 1252); see Torrini 1991, p. 56, cat. nos. 63 and 64. De Superville also retained drawings copied from the Marriage of the Virgin , Christ in the House of Martha , The Resurrection of Lazarus, and an Angel in Noli me Tangere ; see Torrini 1991, pp. $7-59, cat. nos. 65-69. For another drawing by Humbert de Superville made in the Rinuccini chapel but retained by Ottley, see above, under Ottley Collection, Cat. no 33. The present drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. 35.

Brown 393</page><page sequence="396">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE The drawing records one of the twenty-six panels from an Armadio (cupboard) in the Sacristy of S. Croce, representing scenes from the life of Christ and of St. Francis. They were painted by Taddeo Gaddi, during the 1330s; they were attributed to Giotto, incorrectly, by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 79; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 375, although Milanesi in a footnote qualified this and gave them instead to a Giotto follower. Around 1814, the panels were removed from the church and dispersed; most including The Transfiguration went to the Accademia, Florence, but some are in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, and the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. The attribution to Giotto was then questioned by Rumohr 1831, 11, p. 63. For the current attribution to Taddeo Gaddi, see Ladis 1982, pp. 114-26, no. 6; and in the Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xi, p. 888. Prima facie, the present drawing is by Ottley. This is stated in the inscription, l.r., and the infor- mation is repeated on the engraving, reproduced as IVY. O del1, but without the engraver's name, in Ottley 1826, pl. XX. However, the writing is in Italian, Ottley's characteristic signature does not match that on this drawing, and it seems likely that all this information, which nevertheless may still be accurate, was added to the drawing later, perhaps by the engraver. Ottley 1808-23, p. 8, had earlier published a less refined print of The Transfiguration , made from a drawing by himself, engraved by T.V., and dated 1818. This suggests that Ottley did copy the panel, although the present drawing was apparently not the source for the earlier print. The greatly superior 1826 print is reproduced as pl. XX, together with another panel from the series, The Last Supper , also now in the Accademia, Florence, where the connected drawing is credited to Humbert de Superville. No such drawing by Humbert de Superville is now to be found in the Ottley Collection, but a long sequence of drawings by Humbert connected with The Last Supper remain in his own collection at the Accademia, Venice; see Torrini 1991, pp. 49-52, cat. nos. 51-56; Previtali 1962, p. 50, note 33. These include a large squared compositional study (inv. 1308), a smaller more highly finished copy of the entire scene (inv. 1309), and details of various groups of apostles, annotated with colour notes concerning the original frescoes (inv. 1278, 1279, and 13 10, 13 11). Previtali 1964, p. 181, has commented on the artist's 'studio analitico del quadro quale pochi compiono ancor oggi, sono di una incredibile accuratezza nel rendere, successivamente, ogni dettaglio della rappresentazione come nel registrare, in fondo al foglio, i colori'. Humbert de Superville also made drawings from other panels from the Armadio (see Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 37 and 38 below) but nothing by him relating to The Transfiguration has come to light; he might well have left it for Ottley's exclusive attention. It seems likely that these drawings were all made in 1798 when the two artists are recorded together at Florence. Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23 reproduced The Transfiguration (vi, pl. CXIV, no. 1), together with St Francis appearing to his brothers (vi, pl. CXIV, no. 2) and The Stigmatization of St Francis (vi, pl. CXIV, no. 3). Tracings on transparent waxed paper for all these prints are preserved at the Vatican, Vat. Lat. 9843, f. 66r and v, for the St. Francis scenes; and f. 6yr (graphite on tracing paper; 350 X 312) for The Transfiguration. There are further tracings related to scenes Séroux d'Agincourt did not reproduce, including, f. 65V The Crucifixion ; f. 67V Baptism; and f. 68r Dispute among the Doctors ; which together suggest a major commitment by the French writer, although the identity of the draughtsman who made the tracings (Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli?) remains uncertain. 394</page><page sequence="397">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE 37.

Croce in Firenze. / D. Humbert./. The drawing by Humbert de Superville records one of the twenty-six panels from an Armadio in the Sacristy of S. Croce, by Taddeo Gaddi, described under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 36 above; for this panel, see Ladis 1982, p. 114. The panel copied here is now at the Gemäldegalerie Berlin. Humbert de Superville also retained two studies of details from this design in his own collection, now at the Accademia, Venice (inv. 1251 and 1273); see Torrini 1991, pp. 53-54, cat. nos. 58 and 59. The Italian inscription might suggest that this drawing, like the above-mentioned Cat. no. 36, received the attention of an engraver but, unlike The Transfiguration , the present drawing was never published either by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23 or by Ottley 1826. 38.

Croce a Firenze The drawing records figures from two of the series of twenty-six panels from an Armadio (cup- board) in the Sacristy of S. Croce, representing scenes from the life of Christ and of St. Francis, painted by Taddeo Gaddi, and now dispersed; see above under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 36. The two scenes addressed in the present drawing are The Adoration of the Shepherds , and The Dream of Innocent III ; both panels are now in the Accademia, Florence. The two figures on the right of the drawing are adoring shepherds. The figure on the left is the man kneeling beneath the Pope's bed. An autograph version of this drawing, signed and of almost identical size, by Humbert de Superville, is at the Accademia, Venice (inv. 13 12; see Torrini 1991, p. 54, cat. no. 60: pen and black ink; 187 x 268 mm; see further Previtali 1962, p. 50, note 33). The inscription Giotto on the present drawing appears to be in de Superville's own distinctive hand, suggesting his personal involvement. The Italian inscription is in another hand, possibly an engraver; this hand apparently recurs on Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 36, The Transfiguration , and Cat. no. 37, The Resurrection of the dead child. However, this drawing was not engraved or reproduced either by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23 or Ottley 1826. FLORENCE, CHURCH OF S. LORENZO 39.

Avery, in Grope Dictionary of Art , ix, 1996, p. 128. The pulpit, which was not put up until 1558, was already well known to Grand Tourists, includ- ing Northall 1766, p. 90, Lalande 1769, 11, p. 315, and Martyn 1787, p. 322. Lalande addresses the unfinished quality and the expressive power of Donatello's reliefs: 'Elles ont des parties qui ne sont pas entièrement [sic] terminées, mais qui ne font pas moins de plaisir aux artistes &amp; aux vrais con- noisseurs, en leur découvrant avec quelle hardiesse il faisoit déjà sentir, par le seul secours de la pointe &amp; de la gradine, de la fierté dans ses ébauches.' The present drawing, a freely executed sketch, which captures much of the raw emotion and physical torment of the original, was followed by a far more structured drawing, for which see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 40 below, signed by Humbert de Superville, who was certainly responsible for this one as well. 40.

Lorenzo. The style of this highly finished drawing is similar to Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 40 above. However, it has not been squared, and it was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. There may well have been an earlier preparatory study, comparable to Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 39 above. But no such drawing by Humbert de Superville survives either in the Ottley portfolio or in the artist's own collection, now at the Accademia Venice. Indeed, there is nothing at all by de Superville in Venice connected with the Donatello pulpits. This might suggest that the present group of drawings made in S. Lorenzo (Cat. nos. 39-42), were specifically commissioned by Ottley from the Dutch artist for his own exclusive use. Ottley had already used a detail drawing of his own, now lost, as the basis for a modest engraving of a figure in the central foreground of The Crucifixion which he executed himself and published 1823, p. 12. This, as well as his commissions to de Superville, may well have been inspired by inspection of Flaxman's V&amp;A Sketchbook (2790), which contains several copies from the S. Lorenzo pulpits, including one of The Entombment , f. 3 or, where the figures, drawn in graphite, are almost abstract expressive forms, far removed from the minutiae required for repro- ductive engraving. This and other drawings of scenes from the south pulpit, The Three Mariess at the Tomb , f. 65r, executed in pen and ink and grey wash, and notable for its complex illusionism and spatial projection, The Descent into Limbo , f. 3ir, and The Ascension , f. 62r (see Pope-Hennessy 1RS 1 97 1, figs. 34 and 35) probably all date from 1791 when Flaxman revisited Florence or less probably 1794 when he was on his way home to England; he makes no reference to them in his 1787 Fitzwilliam Journal, and there are no copies in his Yale Sketchbook which also apparently dates from that time. The dynamic energy of these drawings, recording the immediate response of a creative artist and sculptor, is in marked contrast to the precision and preoccupation with surface design and the complexity of the compositions, necessary for the reproductive engraver, and achieved in the drawings made by Humbert de Superville which probably date from 1798, when he and Ottley were together at Florence. FLORENCE, CHURCH OF S. MARIA NOVELLA, (CHIOSTRO VERDE) 43. John Sartain after Tommaso Piroli after Paolo Uccello The Sacrifice of Noah Pen and red ink on tracing paper; 215 x 307 Inscribed in red ink, u.r. and l.r.: R Inscribed on the mount, 1.1., in graphite: 33.7 The drawing records Uccello's fresco in the Chiostro Verde of S. Maria Novella, Florence; for the fresco cycle, which may date from around the mid-i440s to the early 1450s, see Pope-Hennessy 1969, pp. 145-47, pls. 31-48, and C. Lloyd, in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, xxxi, p. 514. This is an engraver's tracing, presumably made from the lost drawing by Piroli, dated 1798, that is recorded by Ottley on the print he published 1826, pl. XXXIII. Ottley credits J. S. [J. Sartain] who worked for him in London during the preparation of his book, with the execution of the print and prima facie Sartain also made this drawing. 397</page><page sequence="400">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, in, p. 145, claims the credit for being the first to publish an engrav- ing of Uccello's fresco of The Sacrifice of Noah (vi, pl. CXLVI); (Fig. 2). This was based on an anonymous pen and ink outline drawing in the Vatican, Vat. Lat. 9847, f. 73r (Fig. 3). Séroux d'Agincourt and Ottley were not using the same drawing for their respective reproductions. There is a strange discrepancy in the depiction of a sheep in the left foreground which faces in the opposite direction in Ottley 's plate (Fig. 4). The fresco is now too damaged to determine which version is correct, and indeed damage at the time the drawings were made may explain the varant readings. Séroux also commissioned a pen and ink drawing of The Flood , including the recession of the flood, with Noah's Ark shown twice, on each side of the page (Vat. Lat 9847, f. 72v), which he did not reproduce (Fig. 5). Flaxman also copied this scene, in his V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 63 r (Fig. 6). This drawing might have been made in 1787 on his first visit to Florence, but more prob- ably dates from his return there in 1791. There is absolutely no connection between Flaxman's lively sketch in pen and ink and grey wash, which is remarkably vibrant and full of movement, and the inert over emphatic line drawing in pen and ink and graphite, in the Vatican. On the other hand, Flaxman's elimination of much of the foreshortened structure of the ark itself restricted his opportunity to demonstrate Uccello's mastery of geometrical perspective which 'he brought ... to a perfection that bewitched several of his cotemporaries' ( Lectures , 1829, x, p. 323). Humbert de Superville in his turn also made a graphite drawing of Noah from this scene, now at the Accademia, Venice (inv. 1260; Torrini 1991, p. 67, cat. no. 84) together with another drawing of the figure of God the Father in The Creation of the Animals (inv. 1298; Torrini 1991, p. 67, cat. no. 83) which almost certainly date from 1798 when he was working in the Spanish chapel at S. Maria Novella and on other projects in the city, together with Ottley. Both he and Flaxman, apparently indepen- dently, also made copies from a further fresco in the Chiostro Verde, now destroyed, of scenes from the story of Abraham, Abraham and the Three Angels and The Dream of Abraham; see Flaxman V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 54r; De Superville collection, Venice (inv. 1338 and 1274), Torrini 1991, p. 68, cat. nos. 85 and 86. Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, m&gt; P- I45. echoes Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), m, pp. 62-64; (Milanesi 1878-85), 11, pp. 209-11, in writing with unusual enthusiasm about the frescoes, especially The Sacrifice of Noah : Cette peinture, qui était inédite, ... est de Paul Uccello, l'un des maîtres de l'école florentine, qui con- tribua le plus à perfectionner la science de la perspective et des raccoursis, le jet des draperies, et le premier qui mit quelque vérité dans l'imitation des animais et du paysage. Parmi les compositions qu'il a exécutées dans ce cloître, celle-ci est célebrée par Vasari comme le meilleur de ces ouvrages; elle représente Noé entouré de sa famille, offrant à Dieu un sacrifice, au sortir de l'arche; elle est peinte d'une seule couleur de terre verte, rehaussée de blanc dans les clairs; espèce de peinture, en camayeu, que ce peintre affecta dans la plupart de ses ouvrages, à l'imitation de ces peintures monochromes que pratiquaient les premiers peintres grecs, suivant le témoinage de Pline . . . This passage is curiously at odds with the naïve almost Disney-like quality of the depiction of the animals in Séroux's simple line engraving. The print published by Ottley after Piroli is not much better but it has the advantage of cross-hatching to establish light and shade in the folds of draper- ies and three-dimensional modelling of the figures. As Ottley 1826, under no. XXXIII, observes: 4 Paolo Uccello was among the first painters who assiduously applied himself to the study of perspec- tive; and in consequence, was enabled to fore-shorten his figures with boldness and truth of effect. The piece here given is, perhaps, on the whole, the best specimen of his talents now existing.' 398</page><page sequence="401">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Fig. 2 After Uccello, The Sacrifice of Noah.

Anonymous Italian artist after Domenico Ghirlandaio Apparition of the Angel to Zaccharias Pen and black ink, and graphite; 3 10 X 49$ The sheet joined vertically at the centre; further joins 20 mm from left edge and 40 mm from the right edge Inscribed in graphite, u.r.: La fascia non corrispodano a pilastri Inscribed in ink in right margin, u.r.: questa cornice oscure tutto Inscribed in graphite below, l.r.: Domenico Ghirlandajo. S.Maria Novella a Firenze The drawing records one of Domenico Ghirlandaio's fresco scenes from the lives of the Virgin and of St. John the Baptist in the choir of S. Maria Novella, Florence; see Berenson 1963, 1, p. 74 and il, pl. 971. The frescoes are described by Vasari 1568 (Bottari Sc Della Valle 1791-94), iv, pp. 166-71; (Milanesi 1878-85), m, pp. 262-68, as by Domenico Ghirlandaio. The decorated painted columns that frame the fresco are not incorporated, but the copyist has added marginal notes, u.r., concerning the architectural context. The inscriptions suggest an Italian draughtsman. He may well have been one of the team of artists employed by Séroux d'Agincourt, since although the French writer did not reproduce this scene, he did illustrate three others from the cycle: 1810-23, vi, pl. CLVII. The same artist might well have copied all of these. Among the artists who are recorded working with or for Ottley in S. Maria Novella, c.1798, and who were also connected directly with Séroux d'Agincourt's project, Tommaso Piroli stands out. He made a lost drawing (see under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 43 above) after Uccello's The Sacrifice of Noah in the Chiostro Verde of S. Maria Novella, which was reproduced by Ottley 1826, pl. XXXIII. He may also have made the drawing of this subject that was published by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CXLVI, although the poor quality suggests otherwise. Humbert de Superville who was also with Ottley in Florence in 1798 spent time in S. Maria Novella to make copies of details both in the Spanish chapel and in the Chiostro Verde (see Torrini 1991, pp. 65-68, cat. nos. 80-86) but only one drawing (inv. 1267; Torrini 1991, p. 69, cat. no. 87), a head of an elderly woman from The Birth of St. fohn the Baptist , relates to the Domenico Ghirlandaio frescoes in the Tribune. He also made a further copy, retained by Ottley (see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 45 below), of figures from Andrea da Firenze's fresco of The Triumph of St. Thomas Aquinas in the Spanish chapel. However, the present intricate compositional drawing is not directly comparable in style or purpose to any of de Superville's other works in the same church and lacks his tendency towards abstraction from the narrative. An alternative Italian candidate is the anonymous master (N.N.) who is associated with drawings dating from 1799 for four prints published by Ottley of the Baptistery Gate of Paradise (see above Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 28 and 29) and whose purist classical style has been compared with Giovanni Battista Dell'Era, an artist (see Calbi 1986) who on occasion supplied Séroux d'Agincourt. Ottley himself made no copies in S. Maria Novella and did not reproduce this drawing in 1826. 401</page><page sequence="404">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE FLORENCE, CHURCH OF S.

Maria Novella, Florence. These frescoes, which date from a commission in December 1365, and are focused on the theme of the Glorifica- tion of the Dominican Order, had been attributed to Taddeo Gaddi by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 233; (Milanesi 1878-85), i pp. 581-82; but were reattributed to Andrea da Firenze by Crowe and Cavalcaselle 1903-14 (1923), 11, pp. 141-45. See further A. Tartuferi, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, pp. 15-16. One figure in this drawing, St. John Chrysostomos, was engraved by Tommaso Piroli after Humbert de Superville, and reproduced by Ottley 1826, pl. XXVIII, together with three other figures from the same composition, for which no connected drawings are known. The present drawing may be attributed to Humbert de Superville, on the evidence of the print's inscription, and dated 1798. Moreover it is executed with the tight delicate pen work, and a meticulous preoccupation with beards, characteristic of Humbert de Superville. There are other drawings by de Superville, made after frescoes on the other walls in the same chapel, which he evidently retained for himself, and on which he describes working in his Essai 1827 (Bolten 1997, p. 84). These are now at the Accademia, Venice: a study for a kneeling saint in The Ascension on the vault (inv. 1256; Torrini 1991 p. 66, cat. no. 81); a study of a seated old man in the foreground of The Way to Salvation on the right wall of the chapel (inv. 1277; Torrini 1991, p. 66, cat. no. 82); and a group from The Healing of the Paralytic Girl on the entrance wall of the chapel, devoted to scenes from the life of St. Peter Martyr (inv. 1277; Torrini 1991, p. 65, cat. no. 80). At that time these frescoes were all thought to be by Simone Martini (cf. Vasari, ibid.) but they too are now given to Andrea da Firenze.

Son of Fra Filippo Lippi Prov: Appleby; Sotheby's, London, 19 October 1989; David B. Brown The drawing, like Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 46 above, records part of Filippino Lippi's decora- tions on the altar wall of the Strozzi chapel in S. Maria Novella. This drawing was not engraved or reproduced either in Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23 or Ottley 1826. It is hard to pinpoint any drawings of the quality of this signed Piroli copy in the Vatican archive. Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 1, Préface, p. ii, after paying tribute to Gian Giacomo Machiavelli, as his principal draughtsman, singles out Piroli as the principal engraver in his regular employment for the reproduction of painting and sculpture. This might well suggest that Piroli concentrated largely on making the prints for the Frenchman's volumes; and that it was only on Ottley's initiative that Piroli, who had also worked as an engraver for Flaxman, joined the in situ copying expeditions during the course of 1798 and displayed his considerable artistic skills as a copyist, which he had already demonstrated elsewhere since at least 1788. LUCCA, CATHEDRAL/DUOMO 48. W. Y. Ottley after Nicola Pisano The Deposition Pen and black ink, traces of graphite; 210x325 The drawing records Nicola Pisano's relief sculpture of The Deposition from the north tympanum of the façade of Lucca Cathedral, dating fom c. 1258-60, which had been praised under the names of Nicola and Giovanni Pisano by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), i, p. 274; (Milanesi 1878-85), 1, p. 300; see Laura Cristiani, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxiv, p. 867. The drawing was engraved in England by J. Godby in 1809 for reproduction in Ottley 1823, p. 1; and this print was apparently used again in Ottley 1826, pl. V. The inscriptions on the 1826 print credit the drawing to Ottley. In 1823, p. 4, Ottley described the Lucca relief as follows: nor should we pass unnoticed the semicircular alto-relievo representing Christ taken down from the Cross, which he placed over the door of the cathedral of Lucca; a group which, for its simplicity and devout sentiment, has seldom been surpassed; at the same time that its mode of composition renders it admirably calculated for the compartment it fills. 403</page><page sequence="406">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Ottley's carefully controlled drawing vividly evokes the emotional language of this beautifully composed relief sculpture. Prior to Ottley, Flaxman had also visited Lucca, possibly c. 1791, and copied this relief, in his V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 2jr, with some care and definition, but far more vitality and a greater sense of sculptural form. However, this was not a Grand Tour sight, and it was ignored by Lalande 1769, li, pp. 540-42, and Martyn 1787, pp. 346-47, as they passed through the city. ORVIETO Orvieto was not a Grand Tourist landmark. Lalande 1769, 11, p. 628, by-passing the place, simply remarks: 'Cette ville est renommée par ses vins.' Martyn 1787, p. 302, does rather better. Although he warns that 'the road is so rocky, that it will be necessary to make this excursion on horseback', he draws attention to the city's artistic heritage: At no great distance from Bolsena is Orvieto. The Cathedral is a very fine gothic building; the front at least as beautiful as that of Siena, and very rich in sculpture and mosaic. Nicola Pisano had some hand in it as a sculptor, but was not an architect. It contains a great deal both of sculpture and painting within. Of the latter, a chapel painted by Signorelli, with the last judgement, is most remarkable, particularly because Michelangelo used to study it. Lanzi 1808 (1968), i, p. 25, to whom Ottley often referred during his travels, also praises and attributes to Nicola Pisano the façade of the Cathedral: 'Molto meglio lavorò poi le due storie del Giudizio universale al duomo di Orvieto e il pergamo di San Giovanni di Pisa . . . . ' The attribution of the Cathedral façade to Nicola Pisano had been repeated from Vasari to Lanzi, and this applied also to Guglielmo Della Valle, Storia , 1791, Séroux d'Agincourt, and Ottley who played such an important role in its réévaluation but who also raised the possibility that some scenes were done by his pupils (see further Previtali 1962, p. 49, note 29). Ottley 1808-23, pp. 3-4, having described Nicola's monuments at S. Domenico, Bologna, and at Lucca (see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 48 above), wrote thus: . . . the strongest evidence of the boldness and fecundity of this artist's genius is the very extensive work in alto and basso-relievo, in white marble, on the façade of the cathedral at Orvieto. Here are repre- sented in almost numberless compartments, divided by arabesques, the different stories of the Old and New Testament, from the creation of man to the final judgement. Some of these sculptures are said to have been entirely executed by Niccola himself: many remained, after his death, to be finished by his son Giovanni Pisano and others of the school: the same comprehensive mind however, no doubt, planned the whole. This work, perhaps more than any other in Italy, presents ample illustration of the state of sculpture during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and might alone furnish matter for an enlarged disquisition. A few general remarks concerning them are all the nature of this publication will admit. In point of composition, the several compartments are always good, sometimes strikingly fine, and invari- ably expressive of their subjects; and so great, yet unaffected, is their variety, as to leave little to regret at the want of a more studied and artificial mode of grouping. Nor in the executive parts of the art are these sculptures devoid of excellence: the naked figures, it is true, are frequently meagre, the heads somewhat large, and deficient in variety of character: but energy and expression pervade the whole; the bones and tendons are marked with boldness, and even with accuracy; the female figures are simple and graceful, whilst their draperies are so judiciously cast, and so well understood, as to remind us, at least, of the good works of ancient art. In what relates to the dexterous management of their brittle materials, few sculptors have surpassed Niccola Pisano; many of the figures in this work, together with their appendages, being 404</page><page sequence="407">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE cut in almost entire relief, and exquisitely finished, with the same apparent ease as if the artist had only had the clay or the wax to contend with. In the nineteenth century, Nicola Pisano's authorship was called into question by Milanesi in Vasari 1568 (Milanesi 1878-85), i, pp. 305-06. The project appears to have been masterminded by Lorenzo Maitani who was appointed Capomaestro in 13 10. The four buttress piers of the façade are decorated with marble panels of relief sculpture representing, from left to right, narrative scenes from Genesis, The Tree of Jesse and Prophesies of Redemption, The Life of Christ and The Last Judgement. For the execution of the relief sculptures, which probably continued from 13 10 until c. 1330, as many as four distinct hands have been isolated but not identified; and it is not certain if Maitani himself took part. The Genesis and Last Judgement scenes have been attributed to him. See C. Harding, in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, xxm, pp. 586-88. The façade of Orvieto Cathedral received a great deal of attention from artists and engravers during the late eighteenth century. The local artist Carlo Cencione appears to have made drawings as early as c. 1780-83 for Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, iv, pl. XXXIII (Fig. 7), and these, or cop- ies thereof, remain in the Séroux d'Agincourt archive at the Vatican, for instance, Vat Lat. 9840, ff. 62V (Fig. 8), 63r (Fig. 9) and 63V, 64r and v, and 65r. Séroux d'Agincourt also introduces another plate, iv, pl. XXXII, that includes, under nos. 2-6, five further scenes from the Orvieto façade (Fig. 10). The drawings for these, in pen and ink, and apparently also by Cencione, are Vat. Lat. 9846, f. 17V (Adam brought to life and the extraction of his rib) (Fig. 12), Vat. Lat. 9846, f. i8v (Formation of Eve) (Fig. 14), plus the engraver's drawings/tracings of the above, Vat. Lat. 9840, f. 59r) (Fig. 13) and f. 6or, plus Vat. Lat. 9840, f. 6ov ( Resurrection of the Dead), f. 6ir (Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise and Adam and Eve labouring) However, much to the French writer's annoyance, they had been reproduced first in Della Valle, Stampe , 1791, pls. IX (reproduced here as Fig. 11), X, XIV, XV, XVIII as after Cencione. See further Loyrette 1980, p. 52, note 33, and p. 54, note 99. As Séroux records, in, p. 30: 'Les cinq bas-reliefs No. 2, 3, 4, 5, et 6, choisis parmi ceux en grand nombre, qui ornent la façade de la cathédrale d'Orviete, ont été gravés par mes soins, pour cet ouvrage, dès l'année 1783, huit ans avant la publication de la Storia del Duomo di Orvieto , par le P. della Valle.' Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 11, Sculpture , p. 66, then goes on to provide a long passage on his desire to draw attention to the importance of these relief sculptures, as a turning point, albeit no more than a point of departure, in the revival of sculpture following the dark ages, and here again, obsessively and somewhat confusingly, he insists on his pioneering position: C'est à remplir ce but que la planche XXXII et particulièrement les bas-reliefs 2, 3, 4, 5, et 6, sont destinés. J'ai fait graver ces derniers d'après d'anciens dessins qui, quoique faits au commencement du siècle, n'ont été publiés qu'en 1791, par l'auteur de l'histoire de la cathédrale d'Orviète; mais, dès 1780, j'avais choisi et fait dessiner avec soin, sur les lieux, les compositions appartenant à la même façade, qui couvre la planche XXXIII, gravée en 1783. On les verra, avec autant de plaisir que d'étonnement, offrir aux yeux comme à l'esprit d'une grande variété d'images et de pensées vraies, nobles, gracieuses ou terribles. Sans doute les figures dont se composent, tant de scènes diverses, que j'ai décrites avec detail dans le Table des planches , laissent plus au moins à desirer, tant pour la correction et le choix des formes, que pour la mesure et la justesse de l'expression; mais n'oublions pas que nous ne sommes encore qu'à la première époque du renouvellement de la Sculpture; son caractère distinctif est que le bien est com- mencé, mais que le mieux reste à faire; et c'est précisément celui que nous offre les ouvrages que nous venons de parcourir.

In 1792 Ottley and Flaxman together made an expedition to Orvieto, probably inspired by the publication of Delia Valle's book. The visit is documented by Mrs Flaxman and took place from 14 to 28 September. Ottley returned the following year for a much longer stay, accompanied by Humbert de Superville. During his only documented visit in 1792, Flaxman made an elaborate drawing, now in the BM (1884.0209.17), showing The Inferno (see above p. 14) from the fourth pilaster, from which details had already been copied by Cencione (Vat. Lat. 9840, f. Ó4r and v) and which had been reproduced in its entirety by Della Valle, Stampe 1791, pl. XIX, as after a (now lost) Cencione drawing. Although Flaxman probably knew this print, his own careful drawing, executed in graphite, 23$ x 49$, was certainly made from the original sculpture. It is inscribed with notes on the dimensions and depth of the marble relief, at 1.1.: This figure 22 Inches high. Greater relief 3 Inches ; at l.r: 55 long. Flaxman's sketchbook, V&amp;A 2790, f. 2r, also contains a Noli me tangere, in pen and brown ink, from the third pilaster (Fig. 15); and apparently by the same hand, on f. 45r, a copy in pen and ink, inscribed Mr Ottley , of Adam and Eve hiding from God , (see p. 18 above), from the third register of the first pilaster, a design that had already been published by Della Valle after a drawing by Cencione 1791, pl. XIII. These two drawings, apparently both made by Ottley, may be derived from the extensive series of copies from the Orvieto façade that Humbert de Superville made in 1793 and which are now in the de Superville collection at Venice; see Torrini 1991, pp. 22-27 cat- nos. 7-16. The Noli me tangere (inv. 1249; Torrini 1991, p. 27 cat. no. 15) in particular appears to be the source of Ottley's copy in Flaxman's sketchbook, which he might well have added, if not in situ , then at a later moment in 1792-94 when the two English artists were comparing notes at Rome. Most of the drawings of the Orvieto façade that remain in Ottley's Collection, which are catalogued below, also appear to be copies he made after Humbert de Superville's sequence of copies made directly from the façade. In the Ottley Collection there are also further drawings after the Orvieto façade which here are attributed to Cencione. From the evidence of drawings at the Vatican which connect with the material in Ottley's Collection, it seems likely that he, Humbert de Superville and Cencione were Fig. 15 Ottley, studies from The Crucifixion in the Camp Santo, Pisa, and from Noli me tangere on the façade of the Duomo, Orvieto, in Flaxman, V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 43r. 409</page><page sequence="412">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE all involved in an extensive campaign conducted on behalf of Séroux d'Agincourt, to supplement what had already been gathered for the French writer's volume iv, pls. XXXII and XXXIII, described above. While Humbert de Superville and Cencione concentrated on the façade, Ottley himself worked on the interior, the frescoes by Ugolino di Prete Ilario, as well as the stained glass window, all in the Tribune. However, it was the frescoes by Signorelli on the walls of the chapel of S. Brizio that inspired him in 1792-93 to execute some of the most elaborate and worked up drawings of his entire campaign in Italy as a reproductive artist; see Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 63-65 and Otdey 1826, pls. LU, LUI, LIV. These Signorelli frescoes which date from 1500-03, had been sympathetically described by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), iv, p. 340; (Milanesi 1878-85), in, p. 690. He regarded the artist as a Quattrocento figure on the brink of the High Renaissance who had inspired and influenced Michelangelo: Nella Madonna d'Orvieto, chiesa principale, finì di sua mano la cappella che già vi aveva cominciato Fra Giovanni da Fiesole: nella quale fece tutte le storie della fine del mondo, con bizzarra e capricciosa invenzione: Angeli, Demoni, rovine, terremuoti, fuochi, miracoli d'Anticristo, e molte altre cose simili: oltre ciò, ignudi, scorti, e molte belle figure; immaginandosi il terrore che sarà in quell' estremo tre- mendo giorno. Perlochè destò l'animo a tutti quelli che sono stati dopo di lui, onde hanno poi trovato agevoli le difficultà di quella maniera. Onde io non mi maraviglio se l'opere di Luca furono da Michel- agnolo sempre sommamente lodate, nè se in alcune cose del suo divino Giudizio che fece nella cappella, furono da lui gentilmente tolte in parte dall' invenzioni di Luca; come sono Angeli, Demoni, l'ordine de'cieli, e altre cose, nelle quali esso Michelagnolo imitò l'andar di Luca, come può vedere ognuno. As an illustrator of these frescoes, Della Valle, Stampe , 1791, pls. XXIX to XXXVI, had again already shown the way, with a seminal series of prints after drawings by Cencione, now lost. The following year, in 1792, Flaxman made a copy of the Signorelli Nudes in combat from a self contained grisaille below The Resurrection of the Flesh . His graphite drawing (V&amp;A 2790, f. 48r) emphasizes the sculptural quality of the nude combatants. Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CLVI also reproduces as a detail the grisaille of Nudes in combat copied by Flaxman. Here too he also shows the complex and crowded scenes of Hell and of Paradise. Ottley echoes Vasari's thoughts in his own written assessment, 1808-23, p. 17, as follows: This great work is not exempt from that dryness of manner which characterizes the period of art at which it was executed, and is deficient in delicacy of finishing . . . The whole displays considerable knowledge of the bones and principal muscles of the human body, and abounds in naked figures which, for the boldness and effect with which they are foreshortened, may in many instances challenge competition with those of Buonaroti [sic] himself. But though the separate parts, or groups, possess great excellence, the composition is not always judicious in the whole. That essential part of theory, which teaches the policy of making small parts of a picture subordinate to the principal figure, or chief group, yet remained to be known; nor was it, until long after the time of Signorelli, sufficiendy understood, that the great distin- guishing prerogative of painting, and that from which arises its chief advantage over other artificial modes of representation, is its power to give upon a limited plane the appearance of boundless space. He adds a more personal note in his volume of 1826, where under no. LIV he refers to the three prints after Signorelli's frescoes at Orvieto: It is mentioned by Vasari that Michelangiolo Buonaroti studied the above work of Signorelli, and that he took hints from it for his own celebrated painting of 'The Last Judgment'; and it was this notice which, first occasioning me to visit Orvieto in the year 1792, gave rise to the present work. It will be seen from the 410</page><page sequence="413">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE 'Group of Angels' in the last plate, that Raffaelle Sanzio, also, was in no small degree indebted to the venerable Cortonese artist. However, already in 1813, well ahead of Ottley's eventual publication in 1826, the German Nazarene artist, Peter Cornelius, had visited Orvieto and suggested to his fellow artist, Friedrich Overbeck, that Signorelli equalled Raphael, thus according him (see Creighton Gilbert, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxvin, p. 704) 'the status of a Pre-Raphaelite par excellence' .

A second version, exactly matching the present drawing both in the figure and the surrounding landscape of trees and rocks, is at the Vatican, Vat.

This drawing (Fig. 17), apparently by de Superville, may be the original prototype on which the Otdey Collection and Séroux d'Agincourt Collection versions are based. Although in this case there is no inscription or other evidence to support the conclusion, it appears to fit into a sequential pattern that applies to several of the other drawings made from the façade at Orvieto that are now in the de Superville collection at Venice, and of which there are copies with supporting inscriptions in Ottley's Collection, as in Cat. no. 49 above and Cat. nos. 51 and 52 below.

Attributed to Carlo Cencione after Nicola Pisano [Lorenzo Maitani and assistants] Saints at the Last Judgement Graphite; 170 x 325 The drawing records a scene from the fourth pilaster, left tier, fourth register of the façade of the Duomo, Orvieto; see Carli 1947, pls. 51 and 59. In style this drawing is extremely close to Cat. no. 54 above, and is probably also by Carlo Cencione, c. 1793. This drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Otdey 1826. 56. Attributed to Carlo Cencione (or Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli) after Nicola Pisano [Lorenzo Maitani and assistants] Inferno , from the Last Judgement Pen and black ink, grey wash; 175 x 335 414</page><page sequence="417">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE The drawing records a scene from the fourth pilaster, right-hand tier, upper half of the first register; see Carli 1947, pl. 54. This drawing, with its emphatic linear emphasis, with little sense of the three dimensional form of the bas-relief, may be by an Italian artist associated with Séroux d'Agincourt, such as Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli or Cencione; it was not engraved or reproduced by d'Agincourt 1810-23 or in Ottley 1826. Cencione had already copied the lower half of the same scene, The Inferno , reproduced by Della Valle, Stampe 1791, pl. XIX. He had also copied a detail, now at the Vatican, in the Séroux d'Agincourt archive, Vat. Lat. 9840, f. 64 (top half); pen and ink, traces of graphite, squared in graphite, 220 X 270; and this was reproduced in Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, iv, pl. XXXIII, no. 8. See further the composite drawing for plate XXXIII, at the Vatican, Vat. Lat. 9840, f. 62, which is based on a sequence of further drawings at the Vatican that also appear to be by Cencione, again on the evidence of comparison with the prints after his drawings published by Della Valle, Stampe 1791. The date of the Vatican drawings for plate XXXIII is given by Séroux as 1780-83. However, Séroux fails to mention the name of the artist and, notwithstanding the clear connection with Cencione noted above, the situation is complicated and confused by the presence at Orvieto of Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli, an engraver and draughtsman regularly employed by the French writer in this capacity (see Séroux d'Agincourt, 1, Préface , p. ii), who on 15 April 1780 made a hasty drawing (inscribed 'fatto presto') after Signorelli in an album examined and assessed by Calbi 1987, p. 35, pl. 20. This raises the question of whether Macchiavelli also copied from the Orvieto façade and, if so, the identification and location of his drawings. The present drawing, with its crude out- lines and rudimentary modelling of figures, is perhaps closer in style and quality to Macchiavelli than to the Cencione drawings made from the Orvieto façade, to some of which Ottley certainly had access. However, if this drawing is by Macchiavelli, its presence in Ottley's collection would be slightly puzzling, whereas Cencione appears to have collaborated with the English artist on a regular basis. On balance, Cencione is the more likely attribution. 57. Attributed to W. Y. Ottley after Humbert de Superville after Nicola Pisano [Lorenzo Maitani and assistants] The Elect in Paradise Pen and brown ink; 125 X 198 Inscribed in brown ink, 1.1., in Ottley's hand: from Howard's sketch Inscribed in grey ink, l.r.: Nic. Pisano The drawing records a scene from the fourth pilaster, left tier, third register, of the façade of the Duomo, Orvieto; see Carli 1947, pls. 51 and 58. The inscription suggests it is a copy made by Ottley from a lost drawing by Humbert de Superville. Ottley probably made a further copy of his sheet, again in pen and ink, for Séroux d'Agincourt; Vatican Vat. Lat. 9846, f. I9r. See Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 15, below. 58.

On the strength of comparison with Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 57 above, it seems likely that the present drawing also derives from a lost Humbert de Superville drawing. ORVIETO, CATHEDRAL/DUOMO (INTERIOR) 59. Attributed to W. Y. Ottley after Ugolino di Prete Ilario Christ in glory adored by angels Pen and black ink and grey wash; 322 X 45$ Inscribed in black ink, below, in Ottley's hand: One of the four Collossal Paintings in Fresco , on the four quarters of the Roof of the / Tribune of the Duomo Orvieto; by Ugolino di Prete Hilario Orvietano The drawing, characteristic of Ottley's style, but not signed by him, records one of the four frescoes on the theme of the Trinity, by Ugolino di Prete Ilario, on the vault of the Tribune of the Duomo, Orvieto, described by Della Valle, Storia 1791, pp. 196-97. This drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826, but another scene from the series, The Holy Trinity with a Choir of Angels , was engraved after a drawing by Ottley that is no longer in the Ottley Collection and has not been found elsewhere; see Ottley 1826, pl. XXXII. There is clear evidence in the Vatican archives that Ottley also supplied Séroux d'Agincourt with copies from the Orvieto ceiling; see below under Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 18; and the written information recorded in the Vatican archive at Vat.

These frescoes, described by Della Valle, Storia 1791, pp. 203-05, represent scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary and the infant Christ; the present scene is described as follows (p. 204): 'Gesù nel vedere la Santa Genitrice con S. Giuseppe finì la disputa; ed accostatosi a quelli.' The present rather schematic drawing, which was not engraved and is not reproduced in Ottley 1826, captures well the vertical axis of the slender upright figure of the Virgin, and the colourful dramatic debate on the right. See further two drawings in the Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. nos. 18 and 19 below, and two drawings at Venice Accademia, in the Humbert de Superville Collection, Cat. nos. 4 and 5, below, also connected with the frescoes in the Tribune at Orvieto, which share the same spontaneous manner of execution. 416</page><page sequence="419">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Humbert de Superville made an outline drawing in pen and ink of the three figures on the extreme left, including the Virgin and S. Anna (Venice Accademia, inv. 1300); this is on the same sheet as the flying angel described under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 59 above. Torrini 1991, p. 28, cat. no. 17, incorrectly identifies/locates this detail as based on a fresco in the chapel of the Santissimo Caporale, in the Duomo, Orvieto. 61. W. Y. Ottley after [Giovanni di Bonino] The Crucifixion , the Nativity , Angels Pen and black ink; 104 X 3 13 Inscribed in black ink, below, in Ottley's hand: Compartments of Painted Glass on the Great Window of the Tribune of the Duomo Orvieto The details in this drawing are copied from the great window of the Tribune of the Duomo, Orvieto, the work of Giovanni di Bonino (1328-34); see TCI Guide, Umbria , 1990, p. 606. The Crucifixion is from the top right section of the central window; The Nativity is from the top left of the central window. The drawings of the angels are from the rose window, above the main window. Several details, probably copied from this or a comparable study, reappear in a drawing attrib- uted to Humbert de Superville, reproduced below p. 422 fig. 19, from his collection at Venice Accademia (inv. 1292). Torrini 1991, p. 35, cat. no. 28, identifies the principal elements from this composite drawing, comprised of twelve separate details, as all from the well-known Fontana Maggiore at Perugia (for which see further below under Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 70-72), but she overlooks the connection with the Orvieto window. 62. W. Y. Ottley after [Jacopo di Pietro Guidi] Bas reliefs on a font Pen and black ink over graphite; 282 x 222 Inscribed in black ink, l.r.: WY.O d / ab Orig. 1793 Inscribed in black ink, below, in Ottley's hand: Small Bassi-Relievi on the Font in the Duomo of Orvieto On the verso a black chalk drawing of three angels These three drawings record badly preserved small-scale bas-reliefs on the octagonal edges of the red marble basin of the font in the Duomo, Orvieto, which dates from 1390- 1403, was begun by Luca di Giovanni (1390) and completed by Jacopo di Pietro Guidi (1403); see TCI Guide, Umbria, 1990, p. 594. The drawings were not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. Indeed, it is far from obvious why Ottley should have copied these relatively insignificant works of art, although his bravura handling of the pen in recording the decorative pattern of foliage around the figures may supply sufficient explanation. Presumably he was influenced by the long but less than enthusiastic notice in Della Valle, Storia 1791, p. 240: 'Le figure non sonno troppo ben disegnate, come quelle dell' orlo, in cui si vede la Lupa lattante Remo, e Romolo, con assai bel modo, e altre figure alate, fatte con gusto da una Artefice Sánese.' He compares the font to the one in Siena Cathedral by Jacopo della Fonte. 417</page><page sequence="420">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE ORVIETO, cathedral/duomo (CAPELLA DI s. brizio) 63. W. Y. Ottley after Signorelli The Fall of Antichrist Graphite, pen and ink and grey wash; 460 X 365 Prov: Appleby; David Bindman The drawing records the design of the left-hand section of Signorelli's fresco of the Preaching and Fall of Antichrist on the left-hand wall of the Capella di S. Brizio in the Duomo, Orvieto. Ottley has concentrated on the most dynamic, almost proto-baroque elements of the scene, with the flying figure of the angel driving out the false prophet, and the fiery rays from heaven destroying the dramatically foreshortened figures of the Antichrist's defeated followers who lie prone in the middle ground below. Ottley more or less ignores the landscape features in the background. Ottley's drawing probably dates either from 1792, when he is recorded at Orvieto with Flaxman, or else more probably 1793 when he made another elaborate drawing in the same chapel; see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 65 below. Della Valle, Stampe 1791, pl. XXIX, had already reproduced the entire scene from a drawing by Carlo Cencione, engraved by Luigi Cunego. 64. W. Y. Ottley after Signorelli The Wicked destroyed at the end of the world by fire from heaven Pen and brown ink; 590 X 324 Prov: Appleby; Christie's, London, 21 November 1978 (lot 4); present whereabouts unknown This outline drawing records the design of the lower left section of Signorelli's fresco of the Last Judgement on the entrance wall of the Cappella di S.

This was followed by a more elaborate drawing involving the application of grey wash to achieve volume and chiaroscuro, and a more dynamic and dramatic effect; see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 65 below. 65.

Ottley after Signorelli The Wicked destroyed at the end of the world by fire from heaven Pen and ink and grey wash; 560 x 393 Inscribed, l.r.: WY.O delt. ab Orig. 1793 Prov: Appleby; purchased from Colnaghi's, London, by the British Museum 1973 (1973- 1.20. 11) The drawing records the lower-left section of Signorelli's fresco of The Last Judgement on the entrance wall of the Cappella di S. Brizio in the Duomo, Orvieto. Here the architectural elements and the grisaille decorations that frame the entrance into the chapel around which the fresco is designed, absent from the earlier ex Christie's drawing (see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 64 above), are incorporated, and the drama of the principal scene is intensified through the addition of wash to achieve shading and dramatic effects of chiaroscuro. Part of this drawing was engraved for publication in Ottley 1826, pl. LII; but the top tier is omitted. For the engraver's drawing, based on Ottley's copies made in front of the original, see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 66 below. The drawing is dated 1793. Ottley had been in Orvieto in 1792, accompanied by Flaxman, but evidently returned again in the following year. He is also recorded in 1793 as having copied Demons 418</page><page sequence="421">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE in the Air from the top left of Signorelli's fresco of The Damned , on the right wall of the chapel, a dynamic design (the drawing now lost), engraved by Sartain and reproduced in Ottley 1826, pl.

Della Valle adds a note praising the façade for its progressive style: 'Questa facciata è tutta di marmo, ed annunzia vicino il risorgimento della buona architettura. Essa è originata di bassorilievi, e di statue condotte con gran diligenza; . . . . ' See also Pope-Hennessy 1RS 1971, p. 311, pl. 99, and P. Pasini, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 1, p. 456, who points out that the sculpture, rich and intricate, emphasizing line and movement, was originally highly polychromed. The inscription on this drawing, in Italian, does not match Ottley's handwriting. The drawing 419</page><page sequence="422">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE might well be by Carlo Cencione, who appears to have visited Perugia with Ottley and Humbert de Superville in 1793, to judge from another signed drawing he made at that time; see under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 73 below.

W. Ot. 1793 Prov: Appleby?; presented by David Bindman and Frances Carey to the British Museum, London, 1981 (1981-1 1-7-18) Copied from a double-sided polyp tych, probably executed for S. Francesco al Prato, Perugia, where Ottley saw it in 1793. Since 18 10 the polyptych has been widely dispersed, but the panel of The Deposition recorded here, together with a panel of The Lamentation, are at the Galleria Nazionale dell' Umbria, Perugia. For the provenance, see D. Gordon, 'A Perugian Provenance for the Franciscan Double-Sided Altarpiece by the Maestro di San Francesco', in Burlington Magazine , cxxiv, 1982, p. 947. For The Deposition at Perugia, see Valsassina and Garibaldi 1994, p. 58, no. 4a. Ottley's drawing was engraved by Tommaso Piroli and reproduced, together with The Lamentation , in Ottley 1826, pl. I. Ottley's drawing for The Lamentation has not been traced. Ottley probably visited the church with Humbert de Superville who made a copy of the flying angel in The Deposition , now Accademia, Venice (inv. 1294), see Torrini 1991, p. 34, cat. no. 27, and Pre vitali 1962, p. 39. The altarpiece is attributed to the workshop of the Master of St. Francis who was responsible for much of the early decoration of the lower church at S. Francesco, Assisi. Ottley, in his 1826 volume, wrote: These specimens may convey some idea of the barbarous style of art which generally prevailed at the commencement of the thirteenth century throughout Italy. In the first picture in consequence of an oversight in the arrangement of the composition, the artist at length found himself obliged to have recourse to the strange expedient of placing a stool under the feet of the Madonna, in order to enable her to reach and embrace the body of Christ. He dated the picture c. 1230. Serena Romano, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xx, p. 761, suggests a date in the late 1260s and then considers Byzantine influence in the artist's iconographical language: 'The Master of St. Francis embodies an important aspect of the contact between Italian and Byzantine art of the period: Byzantine elements, particularly of iconography, are found with western forms of ornamentation and a use of colours that is far from Byzantine.' Byzantine influ- ence greatly interested Flaxman and he explored the subject in his Lectures , 1829, pp. 300ff. PERUGIA, FONTANA MAGGIORE 70. W. Y.

See further Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 71 and 72 below.The fountain which was made 1277-78 by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, and was noted by Vasari 1568 (Milanesi 1878-85), I, pp. 306-07, has been described as 'one of the most significant and ornate of the European Gothic period'; see P. Scarpellini, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, XXIV, p. 519. The relief panels on the lowest basin, carved in stone, represent the Labours of the Months, the Liberal Arts, and Old Testament scenes. According to M. L. Testi Cristiani, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxiv, pp. 870-71, the reliefs of Adam and Eve and the Labours of the Months suggest Nicola's hand, but most of the remainder are by his son Giovanni and assistants. Ottley's three drawings, executed with fluency in pen and ink, are matched by a series of three drawings, inscribed: Giov. Pisano , from the Vatican archive; Vat. Lat. 9846, ff. 7, 17 and 18; see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. nos. 26-28 below. The pairings are the same as those in the present series and they are probably directly copied from the present drawings, either by Ottley himself, or else by Carlo Cencione who appears to have accompanied Ottley and Humbert de Superville to Perugia in 1793; cf. Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 68 above and 73 below. The situation is further complicated by a composite drawing (Fig. 19) in the Humbert de Superville collection at the Accademia, Venice (inv. 1292), pen and brown ink, traces of black chalk, 340 x 225 mm; where Humbert has brought together all three Ottley drawings of the fountain and combined them with details from Ottley's drawings of details from the window in the Duomo, Orvieto (cf. Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 61 above), which they had also visited in 1793. As Torrini 1991, p. 35, cat. no. 28, observes, following Previtali 1964, under pl. 49, this is 'quasi una tavola sintetica di scultura medievale già pronta a essere incisa a uso di un' opera del tipo della Histoire de V Art par les Monumens di J.B. Séroux d'Agincourt'. Unaware of the Ottley Collection drawings, which now appear to take precedence, Loyrette 1980, pp. 48 and 54, note 98, pl. 25, compared the Humbert de Superville drawings with those at the Vatican, described above, and attributed the latter to de Superville, which now seems improbable. The drawings were not engraved either for Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23 or for Ottley 1826. 71. W. Y. Ottley after Giovanni Pisano [Nicola and Giovanni Pisano] Astronomy.

The artist, according to Fahy, may now be identified as Piero di Lorenzo di Prastese. The copy by Carlo Cencione was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. PISA Pisa was an established Grand Tour site but few during the eighteenth century described its artistic treasures with much understanding or sympathy. Although Cochin 1758, 11, pp. 99-100, writes of the Duomo, Baptistery and Campo Santo as tasteless and Gothic, his description nevertheless is relatively detailed and observant: Le DOME est une grande Eglise assez belle; l'extérieur en est gothique, tout bâti de marbre, &amp; orné, sans goût, de colonnes de toutes sortes de marbres, recueillies des édifices antiques, qui ont été détruits. Les pierres sont souvent chargées de sculpture ou d'inscriptions antiques. L'intérieur a de la beauté par la quantité de grandes colonnes de granit, dont il est soutenu; ce qui lui donne un air demi-antique &amp; demi- gothique. Cette église est obscure; les ports en sont de bronze à bas-reliefs, mais presque tous mauvais &amp; demi-gothiques: ils sont de Bonanno. As for the Campo Santo, he observes (p. 103): Ce cloître est décoré de peintures anciennes, dès les commencemens de la peinture, par conséquent mau- vaises: on y remarque cependant déjà une façon de draper Se de former les plis, fort bonne, quoique sèche, &amp; des caracteres de têtes, qui ont de la vérité, mais basse: il semble que ce soit des portraits servilement &amp; froidement rendus. Les six Histoires de Job sont dites du Giotto; le Jugement dernier, ày André d} Orcagne , Se l'Histoire de S.Ranieri , de Simon Memmi. Northall 1766, pp. 24-27, characteristically, is more positive but perhaps less acute, in his reac- tion to early Italian architecture, sculpture and painting: 'The cathedral is a noble, magnificent building, which they say hath been built 500 years . . . .' In the Baptistery: the pulpit is supported by six marble pillars, curious, and of different kinds, having the last judgment represented on it in basso relievo by Nicholas Pisano. The architect of this baptistry was Giovanni Pisano, who disposed the concavity of the cupola in such a manner, as to make a loud double echo of any noise that is made below. Then in the Campo Santo he notes: 'On the walls are several scriptural histories painted by several hands, among which the history of Job, in eight pieces by Giotto deserves particular notice.' Lalande 1769, 11, pp. 469 ff., echoes Cochin, and confirms the general ignorance of the time, modified by some antiquarian curiosity, about Gothic architecture and early painting. Of the Duomo he writes (p. 472): 'L'Eglise est toute de marbre &amp; d'un goût gothique; elle n'est pas laide mais fort obscure.' Of the Baptistery (pp. 477-78): La Chaire où l'on montre pour lire l'Epître &amp; l'Evangile, est de marbre, elle est soutenue par 8 ou 9 petites colonnes de marbre Se de granite oriental portées par des lions, Se elle est environnée de bas-reliefs qui représentent le Jugement dernier, mais ils sont d'une maniere très-gothique, quoiqu'on les attribue à Nicolas Pisan, que ses compatriots appellent le Restaurateur de la Sculpture, il Ritrovatore del buon gusto della Scultura. Finally of the Campo Santo, he writes (pp. 478-79): Les peintures sont anciennes &amp; par conséquent mauvaises, dit M. Cochin; on y remarque cependant déjà une façon de drapper Se de former les plis, fort bonne quoique sèche Se des caracteres de tête qui ont de 423</page><page sequence="426">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE la vérité; il y a entr' autres choses l'histoire &amp; les miracles de Saint Ranieri, protecteur de Pise, qu'on dit être de Cimabue, le plus ancien de tous les peintres, &amp; le premier restaurateur de la peinture; M.

Ranieri (east entrance to south transept) by Bonanno da Pisa (V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 68r); he also made copies of details from BufFalmacco's Last Judgement and The Triumph of Death ; and The Crucifixion by the Master of the Campo Santo Crucifixion. Ottley and Humbert de Superville together made a thorough survey of the Campo Santo frescoes in 1798, well documented by dated drawings and connected prints in Ottley 1826. There is no evidence that Ottley was there earlier apart from a drawing in Flaxman's V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790, f. 43 r, of an Angel from the Crucifixion, executed in Ottley's hand and inscribed by Flaxman with Ottley's name. Since Flaxman left Italy in 1794, it is evident that Ottley had visited Pisa before this date, perhaps c. 1793, following his well-documented work at Orvieto and Perugia, or even before or after meeting Flaxman at Orvieto in 1792 (Flaxman himself went directly to and from Rome to Orvieto). The presence in the same Flaxman Sketchbook of two further Ottley drawings from the façade of the Duomo at Orvieto might be thought to support this hypothesis. Of course Ottley might equally well have added the drawings to the Sketchbook when back home at Rome, at some point during the period 1792 to 1794; Mrs Flaxman's diary records numerous social gatherings with Ottley in those years (cf. p. 10 above). See further under p. 429, Cat. no. 79 below. In 1798, towards the end of his own Italian sojourn, Ottley appears to have been gathering material in Pisa, both for Séroux d'Agincourt (Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. nos. 29, 30 and 31, although none of these was engraved in the French corpus) and for his own forthcoming volume of 1826, which included plates not only after Orcagna and Taddeo Gaddi but also Benozzo Gozzoli, pls. XXI, XXXI, and XLVI, XLVII, XLVIII and XLIX. Humbert de Superville, who accompanied him, may well have been working here on commission for Ottley, as well as for his own records, since many of his best drawings from Pisa are in the Ottley Collection (Cat. nos. 74, 75, 81, 82, 83) and not part of the Humbert de Superville collection at Venice (for which see in particular Torrini 1991, pp. 70-72, cat. nos. 89-91). However, all these admirable early initiatives from the late eighteenth century were to be overtaken by Carlo Lasinio's seminal volume on the Campo Santo, published in Pisa 1812, with superb engravings after all the frescoes in their entirety, executed with a simple purity of outline that in the early nineteenth century quickly caught the imagination of artists, including the Pre-Raphaelites, and upcoming British writers such as Lord Lindsay, who now admired the uncontaminated religious spirit and sentiment of early Italian art and for whom words such as Gothic and Primitive no longer provoked any fears. PISA, CAMPO SANTO 74.

Inscribed in ink, below, also in Ottley's hand: Part of a Painting in Frescoe by Giotto di Bondone / in the Campo Santo - Pisa Inscribed in graphite on the mount, u.r.: Tommaso Piroli (The drawing was probably attached to the mount at a later date) The drawing records the left-hand section of a fresco in the Campo Santo, Pisa, The Disgrace of Job, that was attributed to Taddeo Gaddi in the first edition (1550) of Vasari but incorrectly was changed to Giotto by the time of the second edition; see Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, pp. 83-84; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, pp. 380-81. This view was followed by Ottley and most other writers in the eighteenth century, including Northall 1766, pp. 26-27, Lalande 1769, 11, p. 469, and indeed it persisted until the very end of the nineteenth century. The attribution back to Taddeo Gaddi was first made by Siren 1917, p. 144; followed also by Bucci and Bertolini i960, pp. 98-99, no. 23; A. Thomas, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxiv, pp. 859-60. The drawing by Humbert de Superville, which is uncharacteristically meticulous in the hatching of the rocks and landscape surrounding the figures, may have been commissioned by Ottley and executed by Humbert specifically for engraving. A print after this drawing by J. S. Sartain, who was employed by Ottley in London, is reproduced in Ottley 1826, pl. XXI as after Giotto. The entire fresco had already been engraved by Lasinio 1812, pl. I as by Giotto. 75. Humbert de Superville after Andrea Orcagna [Buonamico Buffalmacco] Christ passing sentence on the wicked ; from The Last Judgement Graphite; 444 x 316 Inscribed in black ink, below, in Ottley's hand: Part of a Painting in Frescoe representing the Last Judgment by Andrea di done Orcagna / in Campo Santo Pisa - David Humbert ab Orig. 1798 Inscribed in graphite, l.r.: 31 The drawing records part of the fresco of The Last Judgement in the Campo Santo, Pisa. The fresco was attributed to Andrea Orcagna by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 243; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 599; this was still followed by Lanzi 1808 (1968), 1, p. 49, but was challenged by Crowe and Cavalcasele 1903-14 (1923), 11, pp. 219-24, who proposed Pietro Lorenzetti. It was given to Francesco Traini, for instance by Meiss (1983, fig. 39); to the Master of the Triumph of Death by Bucci and Bertolini i960, pp. 52-56, no. 6; and more generally to Buonamico Buffalmacco by Bellosi 1974, pp. 124-26, pl. 2, by A. Thomas, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xxiv, pp. 859-60, by Barrachini and Castelnuovo 1996, pp. 23-28, pl. 60, and by Krey- tenberg 2000, pl. 36. This drawing, comparable in style and technique to Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 74 above, was almost certainly commissioned by Ottley for publication. Humbert describes making this drawing, and another of the central angel alone which he retained for himself, in his Essai 1827; see Bolten 1997, p. 84. The present drawing was engraved by De Superville and is reproduced in Ottley 1826, pl. XXXI, as after Orcagna. Ottley here makes a comparison with Michelangelo: 'It is remarkable that the great Michelangelo, [sic] appears to have taken the idea of his Christ, in his own 'Last Judgment' from the figure of Orcagna '. Ottley himself appears to have made a pen and ink version of this subject for Séroux d'Agincourt. It is preserved at the Vatican, Vat. Lat. 9849, f. 19V; see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 425</page><page sequence="428">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE 29 below. Surprisingly it does not appear to have been copied directly from the present drawing made by Humbert de Superville. There are obvious discrepancies in the faces and the folds of the draperies. Therefore it may be an independent study, far less careful and sensitive than the one by de Superville, and might well have been made by Ottley somewhat earlier. It was not reproduced by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23. Flaxman also made a characteristically loosely structured sketch of the angels shown in the lower tier of the present drawing, and he then repeated the central kneeling angel in another study on the same sheet. This sheet in the V&amp;A Sketchbook (2790), f. 28r probably dates from 1791, when the artist travelled north from Rome via Siena and Lucca; in any event, it precedes by several years Humbert de Superville's drawing of 1798. The entire fresco of The Last Judgement and Hell was engraved by Lasinio, 1812, pl. XIII as by Andrea and Bernardo Orcagna. 76. W. Y.

It has since been attributed to Francesco Traini by Meiss 1983, fig. 39; and to the Master of the Triumph of Death by Bucci and Bertolini i960, pp. 46-51, no. 5. For a widely supported attribution to Buonamico Buffalmacco, see Bellosi 1974, pp. 124-26, pls. 1 and 21; Barracchini and Castelnuovo 1966, pp. 223-28; A. Thomas, in Grope Dictionary of Art 1996, xxiv, pp. 859-60; and Kreytenberg 2000, pl. 34. An almost identical version of this drawing, supplied to Séroux d'Agincourt and preserved at the Vatican archive, Vat. Lat. 9849, f. 20 (lower half of page), also has an inscription in English, apparently in Ottley's hand; for this drawing, see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no 30 below. Ottley supplied Séroux d'Agincourt with other details from this fresco, for which see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 75 above, and Cat. no. 78 below. A suggestion by Christopher Lloyd, reported and followed by Hugh Macandrew (ibid.), that the present drawing is by Carlo Cencione, who is known to have worked with Ottley, especially at Orvieto, no longer seems so likely, on the evidence of the drawings firmly attributed to Cencione in the Ottley Collection. Flaxman also made a drawing of the group of lepers in his V&amp;A Sketchbook (2790), f. 29r, prob- ably in 1 79 1 (reproduced above p. 19, Fig. 19). It is notable for the characterization of the five anguished figures seen in profile on the extreme left, whereas Ottley's drawing, with a wider 426</page><page sequence="429">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE focus, emphasizes the expressive power of their outstretched arms, and overall it has a far more geometrical, angular, abstract quality. The whole composition was engraved by Carlo Lasinio, 1812, pl. XIV, as by Andrea Orcagna. Neither Séroux ďAgincourt 1810-23 nor Ottley 1826 reproduced this scene. 77. W. Y.

It has since been given to the Master of the Triumph of Death by Bucci and Bertolini i960, pp. 52-56, no. 6; and more widely to Buonamico Buffalmacco by Bellosi 1974, pp. 124-26, pls. 2 and 19; A.

In this case, however, the situation is complicated by the presence on the Venice drawing of de Superville's name, inscribed in French, apparently in his own hand, and claiming to be its author. In general style, both these elegant drawings are perhaps more characteristic of Humbert de Superville. The courtly figures are far more refined in gesture and movement than the almost expressionistic forms of the lepers in Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 76 above. On the other hand the pre-romantic quality of the Venice drawing, to which Torrini (ibid.) refers, is perhaps a trait more generally associated with Ottley. Since the drawings are not identical, especially some of the faces, this may be an instance of the two artists working side by side. On all available evidence Ottley was scrupulous about acknowledging collaborators and is unlikely to have deliberately claimed de Superville's work as his own. Equally Humbert's elaborate form of dating this drawing, to express his revolutionary fervour, hardly suggests this is a copy by him of someone else's work. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced by Ottley 1826. Lasinio 1812 engraved the entire composition, pl. XIII as by Andrea and Bernardo Orcagna. 78. Attributed to W. Y.

Pisa / compartment. 1st. / Andrea Orcagna The drawing records the angels in the upper part of the fresco of The Triumph of Death at the Campo Santo, Pisa, for which see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 76 above. The fresco is reproduced by Bellosi 1974, pl. 1. The relative positions of the individual groups of angels, from the top right of the composition, firmly modelled and suggestive of wood carving rather than flat painted fresco, have been rearranged in the drawing. The drawing appears to be by Ottley, but it was not engraved or reproduced by him in Ottley 1826. Another very similar version of this drawing (but not a tracing) apparently by the same hand, and with a similar inscription in English, was supplied to Séroux d'Agincourt and is preserved at the Vatican, Vat. Lat. 9849, f. 20 (upper section); see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 31. This is on the same sheet as the drawing of a group of figures (lepers) from The Triumph of Death , for which see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 30.

XV. This attribution was accepted throughout the first half of the nineteenth century until Crowe and Cavalcaselle 1864, 1, p. 397, and 1903-14 (1923), 11, p. 170, first questioned Vasari's account, largely on grounds of relative quality and, in the case of The Crucifixion , its evident shortcomings. It is now attributed to the Master of the Campo Santo Crucifixion by Bucci and Bertolini i960, pp. 35-40, no. 1, pl. 36. The drawing appears to be by Ottley and is comparable in style to the other drawings fom the Campo Santo discussed above, especially Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 78. Ottley did not apparently supply a copy of this sheet to Séroux d'Agincourt, and neither writer engraved these details for reproduction. However, Ottley transferred a copy of the figure on the bottom right to Flaxman's V&amp;A Sketchbook (2790), f. 43 r, alongside another drawing, Noli me tangere , from the façade of the Duomo at Orvieto. Flaxman has annotated the two drawings Mr Ottley, and their style is consistent with Ottley's hand. Since there is no clear evidence that Ottley and Flaxman ever visited Pisa together (Flaxman was there in 1791, before Ottley reached Italy), it is more likely that Ottley made these insertions at Rome, when they were often together 1792-94. Humbert de Superville also made some simple line drawings, now at the Leiden Prentenkabinet, after details in the Campo Santo frescoes, including the flying angel, seen in the middle right of the present drawing; for Leiden inv. PK 1361, see Torrini 1991, p. 70, under cat. no. 89, reproduced p. 178, pl. 27-29; also Humbert de Superville, Essai 1827 (Bolten 1997), p. 89, illus.

Ottley after Buonamico Buffalmacco Angels at The Ascension Pen and brown ink; 165 X 200 Inscribed in brown ink, below, apparently in Ottley's hand: Angels in the Ascension. Campo Santo. Pisa. / Buonamico Buffalmacco The drawing records the flying angels on the left of the fresco of The Ascension in the Campo Santo, Pisa, attributed to Buonamico Buffalmacco, but with the groups rearranged by the copyist. The fresco, which shows The Resurrection in the centre, Incredulity of St. Thomas on the right, and The Ascension on the left, was attributed to Buffalmacco by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), il, p. 182; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 514, and this was followed by Lanzi 1808 (Capucci 1968), I, p. 48, and by Ottley. Crowe and Cavalcaselle 1903-14 (1923), 11, p. 170, after casting aspersions on The Crucifixion (cf. Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 79 above) then questioned the quality of this adjacent work: 'another hand and third-rate talent, but seems likewise to have been executed at the close of fourteenth century'. See also Bucci and Bertolini i960, pp. 41-44, no. 2, illus. as by Master of the Triumph of Death. The drawing appears to be by Ottley, comparable to Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 78 and 79 above.

However, Vasari's attribution was corrected and replaced with the name of Piero di Puccio (fi. 1389-91) by Lasinio 1812, pl. XVIII, and in the later edited edition of Vasari 1568 (Milanesi 1878-85), I, p. 513, n. 2. See further Bucci and Bertolini i960, pp. 108-09, no- 31» and Baraccini and Castelnuovo 1996, pp. 32-35, again as by Piero di Puccio. The precision and linear clarity of this drawing distinguish it from all the heavily hatched drawings, angular and sculptural, made by Ottley at the Campo Santo and discussed above; for instance, Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 78-80. The present drawing might instead be by Humbert de Superville who was with Ottley in 1798. The evidence of the inscription is inconclusive. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826. 82.

Della Valle adds a note praising the complexions of the figures: 'Le carnagioni delle figure mostrano meno di quel rozzo che si vede nelle altre pitture di que' tempi, e negli atteggiamenti di quelle traspira il favore che egli ebbe dalle Grazie'. The drawing records a section towards the right of Benozzo Gozzoli's fresco of The Curse of Cham, of c. 1470, in the Campo Santo, Pisa; see Bucci and Bertolini 1966, pp. 114-15, no. 33; Ahl 1996, pp. 164-67, pl. 207.

The vase depicted in the fourth drawing remains unidentified and is not apparently listed by S. Settis, Camposanto Monumentale di Pisa. Le Antichità , 11, 1984, p. 74. None of these drawings was engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1826, and the draughtsman responsible is not recorded. The Italian inscriptions, the use of tracing paper, and the schematic linear quality of the drawings might suggest an Italian such as Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli, for whom see Calbi 1987, and whom Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 1, Préface, p. ii, described as his principal draughtsman. On the other hand there is no evidence that Macchiavelli worked on this particular Pisan project for his French employer. Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, IV, pl. XXXII, does reproduce the entire Baptistery pulpit, but he seems to have reused or copied a plate engraved by Ferdinando Fambrini after a drawing by Simo. Ravenet, first published by Alessandro Morrona in 1787-93; see Morrona 1812, 11, pl. 5; also Borea 1993, p. 54, pl. 8.

The sculpture had already been noted by Alessandro da Morrona in 1792; see 1812, 11, p. 407, pl. 11, as ancient Pisan school: Cinque sono le statue grandi più che natura, che Pisa ancor possiede del lodato Maestro.

Delle prime ragionando ci fermeremo in quella di mezzo rappresentante la Madonna in dolce atto di porgere una rosa al Bambino adagiato sul sinistro braccio di lei. Questo è quel monumento singolare che noi ravvisiamo non solo per l'esemplare dell'arte di Nino, ma per quello eziandìo della Scuola Pisana. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Ottley 1812. However, this image was repro- duced by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, hi, p. 36, and iv, pl. XXXV, as 'ouvrage capital de Nino'. Although the plate published by Séroux d'Agincourt does not match exactly the lines of the present traced drawing, it seems likely that the present drawing is by one of the Italian draughtsmen associated with the French writer and it may have been made in the context of his publication. In style it shows some similarities with the hand of Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli who, together with Piroli, is said by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 1, Préface, p. ii, to have been his principal draughts- man; for his output, see further Calbi 1987. The Italian inscription here appears to be by the same hand as on other similar drawings in the Ottley portfolio, for instance, Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 84 above and 91 below, none of which relate to copying campaigns or projects with which Ottley himself is known to have been actively involved. ROME For the Grand Tourist, Rome was the principal Italian city in which to study the antique. Flaxman, having arrived here from Florence in December 1787, duly followed this path, as recorded in the two V&amp;A sketchbooks published in this volume. Although, perhaps under Flaxman's influence and with his help, Ottley, c. 1 792-94, compiled an album of prints and drawings after the antique, recently acquired by the Dept of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the BM (see pp. 543-52 below), his own principal preoccupation was always with Italian art. His first commission at Rome from Séroux d'Agincourt was for a copy of Michelangelo's Pietà in St. Peter's, which he dated April 1792, and which was duly engraved for the French writer's publication. Later, in 1799, he made copies of Masolino frescoes in S. Clemente. However, Séroux d'Agincourt appears to have used Ottley mainly for major copying expeditions outside the city, above all at Florence, Orvieto, Assisi and Pisa. Thus, although Ottley was implicated in providing material to illustrate Séroux's principal preoccupation, the decline of classical art during the dark ages from the late antique until the Renaissance, he himself was never involved in addressing what Séroux d'Agincourt might have regarded as the lower points of this evolution, the decadence of late antique sculpture, Roman painting and sculpture in the Roman catacombs and Byzantine mosaics at S. Maria Maggiore (which, however, were noted by Lalande 1769, m, p. 419) and by Cavallini at S. Maria in Traste- vere (cf. Lalande 1769, iv, pp. 529-30). Surprisingly, Flaxman, apparently on his own initiative, did find his way to the mosaics in these Roman churches (see above pp. 9 and 16). 432</page><page sequence="435">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE ROME, CHURCH OF S. CLEMENTE 86. Attributed to J. Sartain after W. Y. Ottley after Masaccio [Masolino] St. Catharine disputing with the Doctors Pen and red ink on tracing paper; 370 X 285 Inscribed in ink, 1.1., and l.r.: R. Inscribed in graphite on the mount: 42.7 The drawing records a scene from Masolino's fresco cycle, of c. 1428-29, in the church of S. Clemente, Rome; see Keith Christiansen, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xx, pp. 556-57. To judge from the evidence of the print reproduced by Ottley 1826, pl. XLII, this is an engraver's tracing after a lost drawing by Ottley, dated 1799. The engraver, J. S., is certainly J. Sartain whom Ottley employed in London. Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CLII, also published engravings both of this scene and another showing St. Catharine's execution. Ottley's print captures both the courtly heroic style and the dramatic focus of Masolino's fresco. In contrast, Séroux d'Agincourt's anonymous outline engravings seem accurate but prosaic. Although Ottley published the fresco under the name of Masaccio, following Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), m, p. 121; (Milanesi 1878-85), 11, p. 293, and Lanzi 1808 (Capuccci 1968), i, p. 59, his accompanying catalogue entry points out that it is 'now attributed to Masolino', the artist who earlier had shared with Masaccio the decorations at S. Maria del Carmine, Florence. Séroux d'Agincourt attributes the S. Clemente frescoes to Masaccio and publishes a composite plate (1810-23, vi, pl. CLV), juxtaposing works from Florence and Rome which he considered to be by Masaccio. For a more recent assessment of the the fortuna critica of Masolino and Masaccio and of the S. Clemente frescoes, see Previtali 1964, Tavole Sinottiche, pls. IX, X, XI. ROME, PALAZZO DEL QUIRINALE 87. J. Sartain after Humbert de Superville after Melozzo da Forli Christ standing in the clouds surrounded by a Glory of Angels from The Ascension Pen and red ink on reddened tracing paper; 370 x 3 15 Inscribed on the mount, l.r.: 45.7 The drawing records a fresco fragment of Christ standing in the clouds, by Melozzo da Forli, from The Ascension that originally decorated the vault of SS. Apostoli, Rome. The figure of Christ was transferred to the Palazzo del Quirinale, Rome, in 171 1. To judge from the reproductive print published by Ottley 1826, pl. XLV, the present drawing is an engraver's copy by J.S., after a drawing by Humbert de Superville dating from 1799. J. Sartain, who was employed by Ottley in London, made the print. One of Humbert de Superville's drawings for this project, a vigorous black chalk study, 229 x 173 mm, squared for enlargement (Fig. 21) is preserved in his own collection at the Accademia, Venice (inv. 1335) and bears an inscription stating the provenance of the fresco; see Torrini 1991, p. 44, cat. no. 42, with a suggested date of 1794-99; Previtali 1962, p. 51, n. 39. Séroux d'Agincourt also reproduced this image, 1810-23, vi, pl. CXLII, but with poor results. He was apparently using different drawings, although none have come to light in his archive at the Vatican; and here, as on other occasions when Ottley and Séroux d'Agincourt coincided in copying the same works of art for reproduction, it is not impossible that Ottley was somehow involved. 433</page><page sequence="436">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Fig. 21 Humbert de Superville after Melozzo da Forli, Christ standing in the clouds from The Ascension , Venice Accademia inv. 1335. The illusionistic decoration of the fresco was admired by Vasari who under the life of Benozzo Gozzoli vascillated between attributions to Gozzoli (in the 1550 edition) and Melozzo da Forli (in the 1568 edition) as further discussed by Milanesi in his notes and commentary; see Vasari 1568 (Milanesi 1878-85), m, p. 52, n. 1, and p. 64. See further Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle, 1791-94), IV, p. 50. Ottley in his turn wrote an elaborate appreciation of Melozzo's proto-baroque qualities in his 1826 catalogue entry (ibid.): Melozzo appears to have been the first artist who conceived the idea of representing in his paintings those effects of perspective which the Italians term di sotto in sù; that is, exhibiting the figures under the appear- ance which they assume when seen from below; which style of art is jusdy considered the best adapted to cupolas and the vaults of lofty buildings. It has, therefore, been thought expedient here to introduce the only work of any consequence remaining by his hand; although properly speaking he does not belong to the Florentine school. ROME, THE VATICAN, CHAPEL OF POPE NICHOLAS V (CAPPELLA LAURENTIANA) 88. Tommaso Piroli after Fra Angelico St. Stephen preaching Graphite; 357 x 285 (sight measurement in frame) Prov: Appleby; Andrew Wilton; Henry Wilton 2000 434</page><page sequence="437">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE This very beautiful and delicately executed drawing records a scene from Fra Angelico's fresco cycle on the lives of St. Stephen and St. Lawrence in the private chapel of Pope Nicholas V at the Vatican. The scenes from the life of St. Stephen are in three lunettes of the upper zone; they reflect Fra Angelico's narrative style, c. 1448-49, and his study of Masaccio; see W. Hood, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, pp. 37-38. The attribution of the drawing to Piroli is secured from the inscription on the reproductive print, also engraved by Piroli 1799, and published by Ottley 1826, pl. XL. Ottley also obtained from Piroli a comparable drawing and engraved plate of St Lawrence distributing alms, another scene in the same chapel, and reproduced it, 1826, pl. XLI; unfortunately that drawing has not been located. This would appear to have been one of the final copying campaigns in which Ottley was involved before leaving Italy. Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CXLV, published, apparently for the first time, Fra Angelico's frescoes on all three walls of this chapel as well as the vault. He may well have initiated the campaign here, in which Ottley then participated, and both writers, in their respective publica- tions, may have used the same or similar drawings by Piroli, although none has been located in the Vatican archive. 89. Attributed to W. Y. Ottley or an assistant after Fra Angelico St. Stephen preaching Pen and black ink, graphite under-drawing; 312 x 273 This unsigned drawing, where the pen and ink is very obviously superimposed over the chalk underdrawing, records the scene painted by Fra Angelico in the chapel of Pope Nicholas V at the Vatican, described under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 88 above. It does not appear to be by the same hand (Piroli) as Cat. no. 88 and does not match the print, engraved by Piroli and published in Ottley 1826, pl. XL, where the folds and fall of light on the draperies are far more precise. The present drawing might simply be a rough copy by Ottley or an assistant. ROME, THE VATICAN, STANZE NOT ILLUSTRATED W.

Attributed to Humbert de Superville after Ambrogio Lorenzetti [Lippo Vanni] St. Paul surrounded by Virtues Pen and ink and grey and brown wash, graphite, framed within a border in pen and ink; overall size 370 x 250; image within border 287 x 130 435</page><page sequence="438">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Inscribed in black chalk below in a different hand: nella sala della Signoria - Sienna / Ambrogio Lorenzetti. The drawing records a self-contained detail of Lippo Vanni's decorations of the Battle of the Val di Chiana and of St. Paul, dating from 1363, in the Sala del Consiglio or Mappamundi, in the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena; see Valerie Wainwright, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, xix, p. 457. This unsigned drawing prima facie appears to be by Humbert de Superville who made another version, preserved in his own collection at the Accademia, Venice (inv. 1265); see Torrini 1991, p. 116, cat. no. 153. The Venice drawing is also unsigned but is inscribed in de Superville's characteristic script a Sienna ; it is executed in pen and ink and grey wash, 342 x 228 mm. The Italian handwriting on the present drawing might suggest it was handed to a local engraver, but neither Séroux ď Agincourt 1810-23 nor Ottley 1826, who presumably acquired it from the artist, reproduced an engraving of it. The two drawings provide important evidence that Humbert de Superville visited Siena. VENICE, PALAZZO DUCALE 91. Italian artist after Filippo Calendario Details of figures on the capitals of the pillars on the façade of the Doge's Palace Pen and black ink on tracing paper; 263 X 268 Inscribed in black ink below: Sculture di Filippo Calendario nel Palazzo Ducale di S. Marco in Venezia The drawing records sculpture, now much abraded and damaged, on the capitals on both façades of the Ducal Palace, Venice. They have been attributed to Filippo Calendario and his assistants; see Wolfgang Wouters, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, v, pp. 429-30. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced by Ottley 1826. Indeed, there is no evidence of Ottley himself working in Venice or ever commissioning copies there. The inscription on this drawing appears to be by the same hand as that found on other similar drawings or tracings in the Ottley Collection, including Cat. nos. 84 and 85, made at Pisa. The artist was almost certainly Italian and may be Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli who worked regularly for Séroux ď Agincourt; see Calbi 1987. However, whereas the French writer did reproduce the two Pisan monuments to which Ottley Collection, Cat. nos 84 and 85 relate, he did not incorpo- rate Calendario's Venetian sculpture in his volumes, and thus any possible connection between Séroux ď Agincourt and the present drawing is purely speculative.

APPENDIX FORMERLY LONDON, SAMUEL ROGERS COLLECTION 95. W. Y. Ottley after a lost, pre-1534 drawing after Michelangelo Abraham, Isaac , Jacob , Judas ; figures copied from the destroyed fresco by Michelangelo painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican Pen and black ink; 200 x 310 (the sheet joined vertically down the centre) This exceptionally meticulous drawing was made by Ottley for an etching after Michelangelo's lost (overpainted) fresco, of 1508-11, from the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, Rome. The fresco was already obliterated by 1534 and instead Ottley worked here from an early sixteenth-century drawing, now lost, that he had known in the collection of Samuel Rogers in London. Another drawing by Ottley of the other destroyed Michelangelo lunette from the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, representing Phares , Esron and Aron, which he also engraved, remains to be discovered. The print, incorporating both of the overpainted images, was published by Ottley in 1827 (Fig. 22), a year after the publication of his A series of Plates, 1826; see Hugo Chapman, Michelangelo Drawings , Closer to the Master , exh. cat., British Museum, London, 2006, pp. 125-26, fig. 45. 437</page><page sequence="440">OTTLEY COLLECTION CATALOGUE Fig. 22 Ottley after Michelangelo, Lunettes from the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, Vatican.

FRANCESCO, UPPER AND LOWER CHURCH I. Attributed to Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli after W. Y. Ottley after Giotto [Master of the Legend of St Francis and Master of the Vaults] Scenes from the Life of St. Francis in the upper church; and the Obedience of St. Francis in the lower church Pen and ink and graphite; 450 x 238 Inscribed, above, by another hand: inglese ved. Prov: Vat. Lat. 9843, f. 7ir This composite drawing was made in preparation for the plate published by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CXVI (Fig. 1). It is made up of individual sections from the fresco cycle of twenty-eight scenes from the Legend of St. Francis, traditionally attributed, since Vasari, to Giotto, but now associated with the Roman trained Master of the Legend of St. Francis. Drawn individually by Otdey and Cencione for Séroux d'Agincourt, c. 1792-93, most are now lost, but see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 2 below and Otdey Collection, Cat. nos. 5 and 6 above. The present drawing may have been executed by one or other of these two artists; prima fade, on the strength of the inscription, it may be by Otdey, but its reductive and schematic quality indicates the work of an engraver or editor, working on the French writer's project. The most likely candidate is Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli whom Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 1, Préface, p. ii, singled out for particular recognition; see further Loyrette 1980, p. 42 and Calbi 1987. The scenes from the Legend of St. Francis depicted here are: 1, top left, The Miraculous Appearance of St. Francis to his Friars ; 2, top right, Death of The Cavaliere Celano ; and immediately below there are three details of heads from this composition; 3, centre left, Confession of the Woman of Benevento; 4, centre right, St. Francis Mourned by St. Clare; 5, bottom left, Miracle of the Spring; 6, bottom right, Lérida who had received a Mortal Wound is Healed in a Vision of St. Francis. These six scenes are combined, bottom centre, with a copy of a section of the central vault in the lower church of 5. Francesco, depicting the Obedience of St. Francis, by the Giottesque Master of the Vaults. This lower section of the drawing also includes, as inserts in the sky, details from two further scenes from the upper church fresco cycle of the Legend of St. Francis. The flying figure of Victory, on the left of centre, is from the first picture in the cycle, representing St. Francis and the Simpleton. The remaining figures, including the flying devils, are from The Exorcism of Arezzo. For a more detailed drawing, probably by Otdey, of the scene recorded above as, 6, bottom right, Lérida who had received a Mortal Wound is Healed in a Vision of St. Francis, see below, under Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 2. Otdey's drawings for the other scenes noted above have not been traced at the Vatican. Evidendy he retained some of these records for his own purposes, and published six of them in 1826, pls. XII- XVII; but these drawings too have vanished.

It is likely that the missing drawings were in a similar carefully finished and tonally accurate style. For a lively drawing by Ottley incorporating the flying figure of Victory from St. Francis and the Simpleton and figures from The Exorcism of Arezzo, see Otdey Collection, Cat. no. 6 above. These details were not reproduced in Ottley 1826. Humbert de Superville also appears to have made an unusually forceful pen drawing, comparable to the present drawing in that respect (Venice inv. 1282; inscribed in his hand Giotto. Assisi), of flying devils from The Exorcism of Arezzo; see Torrini 1991, p. 30, cat. no. 21. ASSISI, BASILICA OF S. FRANCESCO, UPPER CHURCH 2. W. Y.

Francesco, Assisi (for which, see above under Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 1) is very different from the drawing made by Ottley of The Dream of Innocent III , from the same cycle (see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 5). There is no comparable effort here to capture tonal values, or the precise modelling of draperies, or the pattern of curtains and ceiling tiles, or indeed any other striking detail. However, it would have been more than adequate as an engraver's drawing for the initial transfer of the image to become part of the composite print published by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CXVI, based on the drawing catalogued above under Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 1. It may be a simplified reduction by Ottley of a more elaborate drawing, closer in style to his drawing of The Dream of Innocent III (Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 5). 3. W. Y.

Francesco, Assisi; see Bonsanti 2002, pl. 776, no. 1604 as by Roman masters. This is a simplified version of a more elaborate drawing, executed in graphite, and signed and dated by Ottley 1793; see Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 1. The present drawing, to judge from the style and the handwriting of the inscription, was probably also made by Ottley, perhaps working now from the earlier drawing. It was reproducéd by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, v, pl. CX, no. 2; and in 1, p. 128, he explicitly credits Ottley for the drawing. Loyrette 1980, p. 49, comments on the style of Ottley's drawing, which concentrates on 'la sécheresse de style des peintres de la vieille école'. And he continues: La Création de VHomme de l'église supérieure d'Assise, qu'il attribue à Cimabue, est un parfait exemple de cette recherché de l'essentiel, où la simplification voulue doit donner au lecteur une idée juste des mérites qui, sinon, seraient demeurés cachés; vision corrigée en quelque sorte et didactique qui prouve mieux que n'importe quelle démonstration les qualités de la peinture médievale . . .

It was originally made by the artist for his own tomb, was left unfinished, and was installed behind the high altar of the Duomo in 1721. It is now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo. Ottley's drawing is executed in a strong graphic style that empha- sizes the solidity of the marble block from which it was carved, a perception that is reinforced by a strikingly low viewpoint. Although not engraved or reproduced by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, it was almost certainly commissioned by the French writer. It was not engraved for Ottley or reproduced in his 1826 volume. Flaxman also made two copies of this sculpture in the V&amp;A Sketchbook E 442-1937, p. 125, from the front and side, with much closer viewpoints, focused, as Irwin (1979, p. 39) writes, 'on the masses but not the details', with virtually no information on the faces of the protagonists or the surface of the marble, but with a keen awareness of the physical tensions within the figure group. Flaxman makes no reference to this marble in his 1787 Fitzwilliam Journal, and there are no copies of it in the Yale Sketchbook, that dates from that moment. Therefore it seems more likely that Flaxman's two drawings date from 1791 when he travelled north to Tuscany on an excursion from Rome or else the summer of 1794 when he made an extended visit to Florence on his way home to England. There is no evidence that Flaxman ever saw Ottley's drawing, but he would certainly have been well aware of Otdey's enthusiasm for Michelangelo. FLORENCE, CHURCH OF S. LORENZO (SAGRESTIA NUOVA) 8. W.

For this project, see Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 327-38; the statue of Lorenzo (pl. 35) was installed by September 1534. As the inscription suggests, Otdey appears to have made and supplied his copy in 1792, expressly for reproduction by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, iv, pl. XLVII, no. 6. Another drawing at the Vatican, for which see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat no. 9 below, repeats the composition in pen and ink, emphasizing the contours of the figure, and may be an engraver's drawing, perhaps by Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli (for whom, see Calbi 1986), rather than Otdey's own reduction. It is squared for transfer. Flaxman also made several drawings of the Medici tombs, including one study of this figure in the Yale Sketchbook (f. 2ór) which he was using in Florence on his way from England to Rome in 1787; see further the Fitzwilliam Journal, f. 14V. In comparison with Flaxman's understated 474</page><page sequence="477">SEROUX D'AGINCOURT COLLECTION CATALOGUE rather prosaic image, Ottley's drawing of Lorenzo, with its tauter modelling and sharper edges, exaggerated lighting effects and mannerist preoccupation with surface, has romantic overtones reminiscent, as Loyrette suggests, of Fuseli; yet it becomes fairly pedestrian once it has been reduced by Séroux d'Agincourt's editor to a small engraving. 9.

For this project, see Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 327-38; the statue of Giuliano (pl. 24) was installed by September 1534. To judge from the inscription, Ottley supplied this drawing expressly for reproduction by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, IV» pi- XLVII, no. 4. Another drawing at the Vatican repeats the composition, in pen and ink, emphasizing the outlines, and eliminating the mannerist fore- shortening resulting from the low viewpoint; it may be an engraver's drawing, by Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli, for which, see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 11 below, rather than a simple reduction by Otdey himself. It is squared for transfer. Otdey's particular and rather personal interpretation is not well served by Séroux d'Agincourt's engraving. Flaxman, in the Yale Sketchbook, which he was using in Florence in 1787, also copied this figure from the front on f. 23r, as well as other details from the tomb on ff. 24r and 2$r. Indeed, he seems to have pre- ferred this figure to that of Lorenzo and returned to it, probably in 1794, in his V&amp;A Sketchbook (E 442-1937, pp. 126-27), where, as a working artist, he explored the tomb in more practical terms such as spatial relationships and lateral sighdines, none of which particularly concerned Otdey. 475</page><page sequence="478">SEROUX D'AGINCOURT COLLECTION CATALOGUE 11.

XLVII N". 3 Prov: Vat. Lat. 9840; f. 88r (top section) The drawing records Michelangelo's marble, now (since 1908) at the Accademia, Florence, one of four unfinished Slaves, perhaps dating from c. 15 19, intended for the tomb of Pope Julius II in S. Pietro in Vincoli, Rome. They were later acquired by Cosimo I de' Medici and subsequendy, on the orders of Francesco I, incorporated by Buontalenti in the Grotto of the Boboli Gardens, Florence, where recorded and described by Soldini, I reale giardino di Boboli, Florence, 1798, p. 32; see Pope-Hennessy IHRBS 1970, pp. 318, 323, pl. 19. The style of the drawing, emphasizing the inner tension of the body but also carefully worked up with an almost exaggerated degree of surface definition, not apparent in the unfinished marble, is consistent with Otdey's early style in Italy, when preparing drawings for reproduction; cf., for instance, Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 7 above. The drawing was presumably commissioned by Séroux d'Agincourt, and reproduced by him 1810-23, iv, pl. XLVII no. 3. This sculpture was not apparently copied by Flaxman, nor does he mention it in the Fitzwilliam Journal of 1787. ORVIETO, CATHEDRAL /DUOMO (EXTERNAL FAÇADE) 13. W. Y.

Another version, in black chalk, but without any inscrip- tion, and with more detail in the background, especially the tree at the left and the surrounding rocks, is in the Ottley Collection, Cat. no. $0; it appears to be by him, comparable in style to his Figure of a Prophet (Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 51 ) which is inscribed as after Humbert de Superville. Notwithstanding the extra detail, the present drawing, in pen and ink, closely follows the Ottley drawing rather than the Humbert one, and is probably a repetition made by Otdey, or else an assistant such as Carlo Cencione, for Séroux d'Agincourt. 14.

It might be by Otdey after a lost drawing by Humbert de Superville, comparable to such drawings in the Otdey Collection as Cat. nos. 51 and 57 which are specifically identified as having been copied after Humbert de Superville drawings. Alternatively it might be by Carlo Cencione who was also with these two artists at Orvieto in 1792 and was working there for Séroux d'Agincourt. 15. W. Y.

See Della Valle, Storia 1791, p. 197; the reference to Della Valle 1782 appears to be based on confusion with Ugolino of Siena for whom see 1785, 11, p. 200-03. The present drawing appears to be a copy or tracing of a lost drawing by Otdey, prob- ably made by an engraver; it has a dry, linear manner characteristic of a tracing rather than a free copy, and comparable to the style of Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. nos. 24 and 25 below. The drawing was not engraved or reproduced in Séroux d'Agincourt's publication, but this very same design was reproduced by Otdey 1826, pl. XXXII. For another drawing, by Otdey himself, connected with a different section of the same ceiling, and very different in style of execution, see above under Otdey Collection, Cat. no. 59. 19.

This is very different in style; but it is close to a draw- ing in the Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 6o, above, and to two drawings in the Humbert de Superville Collection, Cat. nos. 4 and 5 below (at Venice Accademia, but not catalogued by Torrini 1991), all connected with the same fresco cycle in the Tribune at the Duomo Orvieto, all of which are probably by Ottley.

The English inscription on the drawing, apparently written by Otdey, strongly confirms the impression that Otdey masterminded the copies from this church, commissioned by Séroux d'Agincourt. On this occasion Ottley himself copied the Pietà on the other side of the altarpiece; see Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Cat. no. 21 above. However, neither drawing was engraved or reproduced either in Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23 or Ottley 1826. The S.

These three drawings were probably copied from three drawings in the Ottley Collection, Cat. nos. 70-72, one of which is signed and dated by Otdey, 1793. The Vatican drawings have the same pairing of scenes and the same numbering as the Ottley set, but are slightly drier and more restrained in the use of pen and ink. However, without knowledge of the Ottley drawings, Loyrette, ibid., compared the three Vatican drawings to a carefully executed composite sheet of details, including the scenes from the fountain at Perugia, made by Humbert de Superville and now at the Accademia, Venice (inv. 1292), for which see Torrini 1991, p. 35, cat. no. 28. It now seems more likely that Humbert was copying Otdey, and that the Vatican drawings are either copies by Otdey of his own work, or else copies by Carlo Cencione (who was with them in Perugia) after Ottley.

It has since been attributed to Pietro Lorenzetti, Francesco Traini, the Master of the Triumph of Death, and more generally to Buonamico Buffalmacco; see above under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 75, for further discussion of the attribution and for a copy by Humbert de Superville, dated 1798. The present drawing appears to be an autograph copy made by Otdey of the scene which, in 1798, he had apparently commissioned Humbert de Superville to copy and engrave for reproduction in Otdey 1826, pl. XXXI. The present drawing, Ottley's version, evidendy made for Séroux d'Agincourt, presumably also in 1798, but not reproduced by the French writer, does not appear to have been copied direcdy or carefully from Humbert de Superville's drawing. Nor conversely does Humbert appear to have worked from Otdey's copy; there are obvious discrepancies between the two versions in the faces and folds of the drapery. Loyrette, ibid., without reference to Humbert de Superville's version, suggested that Ottley has here adapted his own style to emphasize the link between Orcagna and Michelangelo whose work he had admired and copied in Florence six years earlier: 'Lorsque quelques années plus tard, lors de la seconde "campagne" toscane de 1798, Otdey copie à Pise le Jugement dernier, il le fait dans un style proche de ses copies florentines; on voyait déjà en Orcagna un peintre inspiré par Dante, un génie tourmenté et quelque fois satanique qui annonce Michel-Ange.' 482</page><page sequence="485">SEROUX D'AGINCOURT COLLECTION CATALOGUE 30.

An almost identical drawing, from the Otdey Collection, Cat. no. 76, and now at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, is also inscribed but not signed by Otdey. It would appear that Otdey repeated his own drawing for Séroux d'Agincourt. Yet neither author engraved or reproduced this striking detail. 3 1 . W. Y.

Originally placed in the church of S. Petronilla, a mausoleum adjacent to the south transept of old St. Peter's, it was moved several times, until in 1749 Pope Benedict XIV had it installed in the first chapel on the right of the entrance of new St. Peter's. According to Pope-Hennessy (ibid.): 'At this time it was placed high above the altar, and the right side was raised 9 cm., so that the Virgin occupied an almost vertical and the Christ an almost horizontal position. The group has now been somewhat lowered, and the elevation has been rectified. According to calculations by D. Redig de Campos, it originally stood approximately 1.20 cm. from the ground.' A drawing by Flaxman, in the V&amp;A Sketchbook (E 442-1937, p. 21), made from a relatively high viewpoint above the ground, gives a vivid impression of the sculpture's elevated position. Ottley's drawing for Séroux d'Agincourt, dated 1792 and probably more or less contemporary with Flaxman's, is copied from a much closer viewpoint, and also shows the Virgin in a vertical posture, with the dead Christ at right angles in a horizontal position. The very low viewpoint produces an unusual effect, so that the Madonna's head seems closer to Michelangelo's Virgin and Child at Bruges, and Christ's left hand is only just visible. Otdey's drawing has been squared for transfer. It was reproduced by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, iv, pl. XLVII, no. 5. 33. After W. Y.

Francesco, Assisi. The drawing should be compared wth an almost identical drawing in the Otdey Collection, Cat. no. 9, signed and dated by Otdey, 1793, black ink over grey wash over graphite; 380 x 310. The present drawing was almost certainly copied from Otdey's drawing rather than the fresco, either by Otdey himself as a gift for de Superville who then inscribed it with the artist's name and the location of the fresco, in his own hand; or else by de Superville himself, working from Otdey's copy. In style of execution the present drawing, although slighdy more schematic, with less detail in the delineation of the horses, for instance, is arguably closer to Otdey's hand than de Superville's, especially in the bold, expressive, colouristic use of wash. 2. W. Y. Otdey after Buonamicco Buffalmacco [Simone Martini] The Vision of St. Martin Pen and brown ink; 322 x 235 Inscribed in ink, below, in Otdey's hand: Vision of S'.

Martino, off the south side of the nave of the lower church of S. Francesco, Assisi. Christ appears to St. Martin in his sleep, wearing the cloak Martin gave to the beggar. The depiction of this legend in Italy is rare. The attribution of the fresco to Simone Martini, now generally accepted, was not current until the nineteenth century; see Fea 1820, pp. 11-12; see further Martindale 1988, p. 175, cat. no. 4, pl. 35, and also in Grove Dktionary of Art 1996, XX, p. 505; Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, p. 627; Bonsanti 2002, pl. 252, no. 3 54. If Otdey retained a version of this drawing for himself, it has not been traced; and the design was not engraved or reproduced in Otdey 1826. 3. W. Y.

Nicola, situated off the north transept of the lower church of S. Francesco, Assisi. By 1306 this chapel was decorated with ten episodes of a cycle illustrating the saint's charity and miracles, taken from Jacopo da Voragine. Otdey follows a mistaken attribution to Giottino, by Vasari (1568) (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 260; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 627, based on a confusion with a neighbouring chapel. The St Nicholas paintings are now attributed to the Master of the S. Nicola chapel (fl. 1295- 1305), a Giottesque artist influenced by the St. Francis cycle in the upper church; see Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, p. 625; also Bonsanti 2002, pl. 588, no. 1237. A more elaborate drawing of the same scene, signed and dated by Otdey, 1793, executed in pen and ink with grey wash, is in the Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 13. The present drawing may also have been executed by Otdey, perhaps copied from the more elaborate drawing, and presented to De Superville. De Superville in his turn appears to have copied a detail from the scene, the sleeping figures on the ground, perhaps working from Ottley's study; Venice Accademia, inv. 1296; but cf.

Of this particular scene he writes (p. 205); 'la SSma Vergine, nostra Avvocata Maria, giacente in letto in istato prossimo di morire, e gli Appostoli miracolosamente dalle parti più lontane del Mondo sopraggiunti, starsene genuflessi attorno di Essa.'

Under each caption will be found the size of the plate (measured from the platemark) and a simple cross-reference, where applicable, to any related drawings that have been fully catalogued above. Where no such connected drawings are known, the print itself is catalogued more extensively along similar lines to the entries provided for the drawings. Although this produces here a somewhat uneven effect, it avoids duplication or fragmentation of the information available. Otdey's own accompanying text for this volume is modest; it is not transcribed here but is cited in the catalogue entries for the prints or connected drawings whenever it is particularly relevant. This Catalogue of the plates from Ottley's 1826 volume is the principal outcome from Ottley's art-historical research in Italy from 1792-98, based on the drawings, catalogued above, which comprise the focal point of this study.

PROOF. 340 X 490 mm This print, after a lost drawing by Ottley, represents a fresco of The Crucifixion , now attributed to the Cimabue workshop, in the north transept (right) of the upper church of S. Francesco, Assisi. Although associated with Cimabue by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), i, pp. 239-40; (Milanesi 1878-85), 1, p. 253, it was attributed to Giunta Pisano in a footnote by Milanesi. See further Crowe and Cavalcaseli 1903-14 (1923), i, pp. 150-51, who distinguish this hand from the frescoes by Cimabue and his circle in the south transept and write of The Crucifixion in the north transept: 'In the broad red outlines, coarsely traced in black, we observe the defects of one who like Giunta lived before the revival of art.' Otdey 1826 (citing Collis Paradisi Amoenitas, seu sacri Conventus Assisensis Hist. 1704, p. 32), had also favoured Giunta Pisano and adds: ť Giunta appears to have been unknown to Vasari, who has erroneously ascribed his works to Margaritone. His style, though rude, was not barbarous. There is sometimes much of grandeur in his conceptions.' He goes on to describe the 'colossal dimensions' and damaged state of this and the surrounding frescoes. He had found them obscured by modern paintings but had been allowed to remove these 'for a few days' to make his drawings. Otdey gives further background information on this manoeuvre in a letter to Dawson Turner, dated October 1826, preserved at Trinity College Library, Cambridge (O.13.31/114). '. . . I caused two modern Altarpieces to be taken down in order to make drawings from the frescos of Giunta Pisano behind them with the intention of causing them, or one of them, to be engraved . . .' Ottley appears then to have passed a copy of his copy of The Crucifixion to Séroux d'Agincourt who repro- duced it 1810-23, v, no. CII. Here it was juxtaposed with further works at Assisi attributed to Giunta Pisano, including a detail from The Fall of Simon Magus; The Assumption of the Virgin; as well as another Crucifixion from S. Maria degli Angeli. It would appear that Ottley had also copied all these compositions for the French writer. As Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, in, p. 122, under no. CII, records: 'toutes ces peintures étaient inédites; j'en dois les dessins à un jeune peintre anglais et j'en garantis l'exactitude que j'ai verifiée sur les lieux . . .' And he adds a small word of criticism, accusing the copyist of overemphasizing the strength and lucidity of the contours of the figures, thereby idealizing their form beyond the level achieved by the original artist: '. . . je dois observer seulement qu'ici les contours ont plus de fermeté que dans les originaux, défaut qu'il est presque impossible d'éviter lorsqu'il s'agit de retracer d'aussi anciennes peintures, dont le tems [sic] et mille accidents ont altéré les linéaments.' None of Ottley's drawings after Giunta Pisano has been traced, and the two composite drawings in the Séroux d'Agincourt Collection at the Vatican (Vat. Lat. 9843, ff. 29V and 3or) that bring together Otdey's work onto a single sheet, for reproduction under pl. CII, appear to be the work of an editor or engraver, probably Giacomo Macchiavelli or else Tommaso Piroli. These are reproduced in Storia delVArte Italiana , n.d., 11, pl. 311-14. Ottley appears to have retained his own copy of Simon Magus supported in the air by Demons , which he engraved himself, and published as Plate III below. Plate III. GIUNTA PISANO.

See Otdey Collection, Cat. no. 48 for a drawing attributed to Ottley connected with this print. In his catalogue entry Ottley 1826 observes of Nicola Pisano: 'He is justly considered as the restorer of sculpture; an art which, from the greater simplicity of its nature, was more rapid in its advances towards perfection, than was the sister-art of painting.'

Jany 1, 1825, by W.Y. Ottley. PROOF. 230 X 385 mm The print records a relief from the first pilaster, left tier, second register of the façade of the Duomo, Orvieto; see Carli 1947, pls. 35 and 39. This print appears to be based, directly or indirectly through the use of copies, on a drawing by Cencione in the Séroux d'Agincourt Collection at the Vatican, Vat. Lat. 9846, f. 17V and an engraver's copy probably traced from it Vat. Lat. 9840, f. 59 (reproduced above p. 408 figs 12 &amp; 13). This composition was engraved and reproduced by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, iv, pl. XXXII (reproduced above p. 407 fig. 10). See further Séroux d'Agincourt Collection, Vat. Lat. 9846, f. i8v, for a closely related drawing by Cencione after Niccola Pisano of The Creation of Eve (reproduced above p. 408 fig. 14), which was also published by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, iv, pl. XXXII. However, Cencione's drawing appears to have been used first in Della Valle 1791, pl. IX, for an engraving by Giovanni Battista Leonetti (reproduced above p. 407 fig. 11). There is no version of this drawing in the Ottley Collection, and the present print might have been made for Ottley by Piroli in Italy, by means of access to the Vatican drawing. For a more detailed discussion of Cencione's role in copying the façade of the Duomo at Orvieto, see under the introductory section on Orvieto in the Ottley Collection Catalogue. Plate VII.

Tommaso Piroli sc. London, Pub: March, Ist 1825, by W.Y. Ottley. 320 X 375 mm The print records a lost drawing by Ottley from a fresco then generally attributed to Cimabue in the middle register of the south wall of the upper church of S. Francesco, Assisi, four bays from the west end, i.e. the first bay on the left as you enter the church. The fresco was attributed to Cimabue by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), i, p. 240; (Milanesi 1878-85), I, p. 253. However, in a footnote Della Valle attributed this fresco and others in the cycle to Giotto, a view first explicitly contested by Ottley 1823, p. 7, as well as in the present catalogue where it is given to Cimabue and where Ottley, 1826, then wrote as follows: 'The naked figure of Christ is very remarkable for its correctness and style of outline; considering the early period of art at which the picture was executed.' An Ottley drawing for the adjacent scene of The Holy Women at the Empty Tomb is preserved in the Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 3; this entry includes further discussion of Otdey's particular enthusiasm for these expres- sive designs. Both scenes were engraved by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, v, pl. CX. He credits Ottley with the drawings but there are no connected drawings in the Vatican archive; see Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, 1, p. 128, under no. CX. Plate X. GIOVANNI CIMABUE.

See Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), i, pp. 239-40; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, pp. 252-54. See further Crowe and Cavalcasele 1903-14 (1923), 1, pp. 150-52, who draw a distinction between the frescoes in the north transept which they attribute to the circle of Giunta Pisano and those in the south transept, including the three colossal angels, engraved here, that they attribute to the circle of Cimabue. It would appear that Ottley also supplied a drawing, now lost, of one of these three angels for reproduction by Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, v, part of pl.

PROOF. 350 x330 mm This print represents one from a cycle of twenty-eight scenes from the Legend of St. Francis, in the upper church of S. Francesco, Assisi, traditionally attributed to Giotto since Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), il, p. 80 (with a note doubting if all the frescoes are by Giotto); (Milanesi 1878-85), 1, p. 377; and accepted as such by Ottley 1823, pp. 10-11 and again in this catalogue of 1826. The cycle is now associated with the Master of the Legend of St. Francis who probably planned and supervised the execution of the entire cycle and himself painted scenes II to IX. This print represents The Death of the Cavaliere Celano. It is on the south side of the nave, on the half wall between the counter façade and the first bay from the east; see Bonsanti 2002, pl. 864, no. 1700. Ottley's drawing on which Piroli' s plate is based has not been traced. For a comparable drawing of a different scene in the cycle and further details on this entire project, see under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 5. It seems that Ottley initially supplied the drawings, that he and Carlo Cencione together had made from these frescoes in 1792-93, to Séroux d'Agincourt for whom a selection of six were then reduced in size and condensed into a composite drawing (probably executed by an engraver such as Gian Giacomo Macchiavelli), now preserved at the Vatican (Vat. Lat. 9843, f. 7ir), for eventual reproduction in Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, vi, pl. CXV. For the drawing, see above under Séroux d'Agincourt Collec- tion, Cat. no. i. Ottley's subsequent decision to publish in 1826 several of these individual scenes in his own volume as well, but on a much larger scale, may reflect both his ambition and his understandable dissatisfaction with the size and quality of the French writer's reproductions of the drawings he and Cencione had supplied. As he explains in his own catalogue entry: This and the five following pieces form part of a Series of twenty-eight frescoes of the Life and Miracles of St. Francis , painted by Giotto , in the upper church of 5. Francesco , at Assisi. Assisi is not far distant from Perugia, and there can be no doubt that RafFaelle attentively studied this extraordinary work, many of the compartments of which, in respect of invention, composition, and expression , merit the highest praise. It may safely be asserted, that Giotto was one of the greatest geniuses that ever lived. His talents were duly appreciated in his own time; and his style continued to be generally followed throughout Italy, till some time after the commencement of the fifteenth century. Plate XIII.

PROOF. 325 X 490 mm This engraving, based on a lost drawing by Ottley dating from 1792, records the upper section of a large fresco in the south arm of the transept in the lower church of S. Francesco, Assisi. The fresco was attributed to Cavallini by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 199; (Milanesi 1878-85), i, p. 540. Crowe and Cavalcaselle 1864, 11, p. 128, later changed the attribution in favour of Pietro Lorenzetti, and this remains the current view. Ottley, in his catalogue entry, considered the work to be a reference point for Cavallini's style, and echoes Vasari in noting the 4 varied and powerful expressions of the angels'. For a detail from the left-hand side of the same composition, signed and dated by Ottley 1793, showing The three Maries , with two horses and other figures, see under Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 9. For another version of the same drawing, see under Humbert de Superville Collection, Cat. no 1 . As can be seen from this print, the original fresco was damaged by the insertion of an altarpiece in 1604/05, below the figure of the crucified Christ and to the right of the three Maries; and although this was removed in 1870/71, the damage and paint loss was permanent. For the present appearance of the frescom see Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, 11, p. 626, fig. 5; Macginnis 2001, p. 153, fig. 41; Bonsanti 2002, pl. 463, no. 948. Plate XXIII.

Maria Novella, Florence, part of a cycle commissioned in December 1365 and devoted to the glorification of the Dominican Order. The figures represent Hippocrates, St. Jerome, St. Dionysius and St. John Chrysostomos. The drawing by Humbert de Superville, noted in the print's inscription, cannot be traced. However, a related drawing attributed to Humbert de Superville in the Ottley Collection, Cat. no. 45, of three seated figures from the lower tier of this fresco, includes the St. John Chrysostomos, as shown in the present print, together with Ptolemy and Zeno. The frescoes had been attributed to Taddeo Gaddi by Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), 11, p. 233; (Milanesi 1878-85), 11, pp. 581-82; this was followed by Ottley. They were reattributed to Andrea da Firenze by Crowe and Cavalcaseli 1903-14 (1923), 11, pp. 141-45. See further A. Tartuferi, in Grove Dictionary of Art 1996, il, pp. 15-16.

See, for instance, Adrian Hoch, in Grove Dictionary of Art 199 6, 11, p. 625 who observes: ťThe stylistic similarities between the Raising of Lazarus and the Noli me tangere and the frecoes of the same subjects in the Arena Chapel [Padua] suggest a date for the Maddalena Chapel decoration after that for the work at Padua and contemporary with the north transept frescoes.' Ottley never saw the Arena chapel which was closed at this time, and, although he normally follows Vasari, on this occasion he took an independent line and attributed the picture of Lazarus to Giovanni Gaddi. By the time he catalogued this print for publication he could no longer remember why. As he wrote: 'I am unable to produce my authority for ascribing the picture to Giovanni Gaddi; though I noted the name of that artist at the bottom of my drawing during my stay at Assisi in 1792-3.' The drawing connected with this print has not been traced. Plate XXX. ANGIOLO GADDI. Nat.13.. Ob.1387.

Piroli may have been commissioned to execute the drawing, now lost, because he had already, independendy copied these frescoes in the Brancacci chapel and issued a now rare series of six aquatint prints: Le appresso sei storie appartengono alla celebre Capella dell* estinta famiglia Brancacci nella nuova Chiesa del Carmine di Firenze ... le medesime furono depinte dal celebratissimo Tammaso Guidi detto volgare Masaccio Fiorentino . . . rappresentanti alcuni fatti delV Apostolo S . Pietro . . . han servito esemplari e di guida per giungere alla perfezione dell'arte ai più eccelenti maestri . . . , Rome (Gio Scudellari) n.d.; see Borea 1993, p. 53 and pl. 4, who reproduces St. Peter Preaching from a set in the Biblioteca Nazionale, Florence, and a further recently discovered set on the London market (Quaritch 2006, Catalogue 1342, no. 64) where they reproduce The Raising of the Son ofTheophilus (reproduced below). A further unpublished set is at the British Library. The present print is based on a drawing made by Piroli in 1798. The publication date of the aquatint series has not been established; they too might well date from the same moment or a litde before, but Borea, for reasons that cannot be verified, has raised the alternative possibil- ity that they are much earlier, c. 1775. In any event, all these copies unfortunately date from after the fire that damaged these frescoes in 1771. On the other hand, Thomas Patch, an English artist resident in Florence, had published a Life of Masaccio , 1770, with exceptionally fine detail engravings of the heads in some of the frescoes in the Brancacci chapel, as Piroli after Masaccio, The Raising of the Son ofTheophilus. Aquatint, n.d., but after 1771. 516</page><page sequence="519">ottley: a series of plates 1826 well as the entire scene, selected by Ottley for his volume, of St. Paul visiting St. Peter in prison (Patch, pl. XXVI) (reproduced below) plus a separate detail of the head of St. Paul (Patch, pl. IV) (reproduced below). Patch admired the frescoes for their naturalism and the artist's capacity to draw from life, 'so different from the dis- agreeable stiffness in the horrid spectres of the School of Giotto and of the modern Grecian Mosaiks' (Patch, p. II). This volume too is extremely rare, since only forty copies were printed; see F. Watson in Walpole Society, 28, 1939-40, p. 46. Both Patch and Piroli mistakenly believed all the frescoes to be by Masaccio. In fact, the chapel was started by Masolino and Masaccio and completed by Filippino Lippl. Vasari 1568 (Bottari &amp; Della Valle 1791-94), ra, pp. 121-24; (Milanesi 1878-85), 11, pp. 289-301 had made the correct distinctions between hands. The error propagated by Patch, Piroli, followed by Ottley 1 826, was corrected by the German scholar Carl Friedrich von Rumohr in 1827. The scene reproduced here of St. Paul visiting St. Peter in prison , is largely by Filippino Lippi, although the head of Paul may have been begun by Masaccio. For the fortuna critica of Masolino and Masaccio and Filippino Lippi in S. Maria del Carmine, Florence and at S. Clemente, Rome, see Séroux d'Agincourt 1810-23, ra, nos. CXLVIII- CXL, and V, pls. CXLVIII, CXLIX and CL. Séroux d'Agincourt, hi, p. 146, wrote thus: 'Suivant les témoignages de Vasari et de Borghini, la suite de ces peintures, qui ont pour sujet l'histoire de l'apôtre St Pierre, fut commencée par Masolino da Panicale, continuée par Masaccio son élève, et terminée par Filippino Lippi . . .'

PROOF 320 X 38$ mm Ottley's drawing for this print, reproducing the fresco of The Dispute of St. Peter and St. Paul with Simon Magus before Nero from the Brancacci chapel at S. Maria del Carmine, Florence, has not been located. Comparison with Plate XLIII above suggests Otdey and Piroli were working together at the chapel in 1798. The fresco reproduced here is not by Masaccio, as Otdey supposed, but by Filippino Lippi who was commissioned in 148$ to complete the chapel. See under Plate XLIII above. Earlier, by 1770, Thomas Patch (for whom, see under Plate XLIII above) had engraved several heads from figures in this particular fresco, for instance Patch Plates III &amp; VII (reproduced below), including Filippino's self-portrait which he believed to be a Masaccio self-portrait (Patch, pl. I) (reproduced below). Ottley too admired the vivacity of the heads and the tradition of naturalism that Masaccio and his followers had initiated, but he felt that the artist sometimes lacked expressive and dramatic force. As he wrote in an earlier publication, 1823, p. 14: 'his frescoes, in the celebrated chapel of the Carmine, at Florence, present many admirable portraits of his friends and contemporaries. But these figures, though they almost seem alive, too often fail to express by their actions or gestures those feelings which the event whereof they are represented as spectators should naturally have awakened.' He went on to discuss Masaccio's influence. In the correctness of his outline and the vivacity of his heads, Masaccio was imitated by his contemporaries and immediate successors; and henceforth the Florentine painters accustomed themselves to prepare careful drawings from nature, of the figures they proposed to introduce into their pictures: but the dignified simplicity of his draperies, the breadth of his chiaroscuro, and the mellowness of his colouring, were qualities which the artists of that time could not appreciate . . .

PROOF 247 X 314 mm This print stands apart from the remainder of this corpus, since it reproduces not a work of art studied by Ottley in situ in Italy but a canvas by Botticelli of The Mystic Nativity that Ottley had acquired in Italy for his own collection; it is now in the National Gallery, London, inv. 1034 (bought from W. Fuller Maitland of Stansted Hall in 1878). After Ottley returned to England in 1799 he had offered this picture (with other acquisitions made in Italy), for sale at Christie's, London, on 25 May 181 1, lot 32, as from the Aldobrandini collection in Rome, but it failed to sell. It was offered again, after Ottley 's death, Christie's, 4 March 1837, lot 75, bought Brown 75 guineas. By then, while still in Ottley's collection, it had caught the discerning eye of the German expert, G. Waagen, Works of Art and Artists in England , 11, 1838, pp. 125: 'A very spirited, and, for the vehement character of the master, a most remarkable picture.' This was the first Botticelli to reach Britain under the correct attribution; see M. Levey, 'Botticelli and Nineteenth-Century England', in Journal of Warburg and Courtauld Institutes , 23, i960, pp. 297-98. Ottley may have been attracted by the unusually prominent angels hovering above the stable roof and participating in the adoration of the Infant Christ. In his own work he displays an obsessive preoccupation with the role of angels in the battle between good and evil. See above p. 365. Plate LI. FILIPPINO LIPPI. Nat. 1460. Ob. 1505. TWO MUSES.

A very rare Collection of Engravings of the Bas-reliefs at Rome, See., interspersed with many Drawings by the late Mr. Ottley, and others, some curious and early, in one volume, oblong.'; Bloomsbury Auctions, London, 18 November 2004, lot 43; British Museum, Dept of Greek and Roman Antiquities, 2006.0515. Oblong folio; front free endpaper inscribed IV". Y. Ottley 1791; 65 leaves only of at least 91 numbered. Ottley appears to have started compiling this scrapbook shortly before he arrived in Italy and apparently added his own copies, as well as copies after Flaxman, and copies from established source books such as Caylus and Montfaucon, in the following years. There is also a tracing after a sketch after the antique by Nollekens, who was in Rome 1761-70, signed by George Cuitt who was in Rome 1769-75. Cuitt, after retiring to Richmond, had subsequently taught Ottley there, as a young boy. Ottley's principal activity in Italy was the copying of early Italian painting and sculpture, and it may well have been under the influence of Flaxman, whom he befriended at Rome from 1792-94, that he extended his interest in antique sculpture. A few of the prints and drawings here relate directly or indirectly to material in Flaxman's Yale Sketchbook and V&amp;A Sketchbook 2790. It lies well beyond the scope of the present paper to list all the prints after the antique gathered by Ottley, but drawings that are signed or that appear to be in his own hand or by/ after Flaxman are catalogued below to complete the survey of Ottley's and Flaxman's activity as copyists in Italy. Folio I, left, GR 2006.0515.3 Scenes from the Trojan War: Achilles drags the body of Hector. Priam leaning on a staff Pen and ink on oiled tracing paper; 154 x 93 Inscribed below: Drawn at Ephesus 1764 by W. Pars. Wood's Essay on Homer A tracing, prima facie by Ottley, of a fragment of a Roman Achilles Sarcophagus, third century ad. The dis- mantled sarcophagus had been built into the Gate of Persecution at Ephesus, probably in the Justinian era where William Pars made his original copy, which was subsequently published in Robert Wood, An Essay on the Original Genius &amp; Writings of Homer, illustrated with engravings , London, 1775, as the frontispiece. The engraving by F. Bartolozzi is inscribed: Drawn at Ephesus in 1764 by W.Pars. And this in its turn was traced onto the present sheet. The sarcophagus relief, together with a companion piece, from the back, which is also recorded in this album, was removed from Ephesus in the early nineteenth century; it was later acquired by the sixth Duke of Bedford in 1824 and it remains at Woburn Abbey; see Angelicoussis 1992, pp. 79-83, no. 63, pl. 186, no. 273. The lower section of the relief, shown here with the body of Hector, appears to have been lost since the drawing was made. See also Robert in ASR, 11 (1890), pp. 57®"* » no* 47&gt; fig* 27 and pl. XXII. Angelicous- sis suggests that the nude figure descending from the chariot in the background may be Automedon, friend and charioteer of Achilles.

Wood's H&lt;omer&gt; 577</page><page sequence="579">ottley: british museum gr 2006.0515 A tracing, arguably by Ottley, after a drawing by William Pars, of a fragment of a Roman Achilles Sarcophagus, third century ad, described above under Folio 1 left, and now at Woburn; see Angelicoussis 1992, pp. 78-83, no. 63, pl. 186, no. 274. The drawing by Pars is engraved by F. Bartolozzi and reproduced on the end page of Robert Wood, An Essay on the Original Genius &amp; Writings of Homer , illustrated with engravings , London 1775, p. 342. The copy excludes the standing man at the extreme right of the marble relief.

P. 2 A tracing or copy, possibly by Ottley, after an engraving in Montfaucon 1719, 1, second partie, pp. 383-84, pl. CCXVIII. The image is inscribed, beneath Mithras's sword and bow and arrow: L. FL. HERMADION HOC MIHI LIBENS DON. DEDIT. Montfaucon comments on the unusual iconography: Un autre Mithras tiré de la Gallerie Justinienne, est le plus extraordinaire de tous, c'est un Mithras baccique, nu, sans armes, portant le bonnet Phrygien ou Persan, &amp; tenant des grappes qu'il regarde. Il semble qu'étant arrivé au midi il ait oublié son cours pour faire collation &amp; boire du vin en abondance. Devant ce Mithras du midi est un autre Mithras qui éteint son flambeau contre terre; c'est le Mithras occidental. De l'autre côté le Mithras oriental éleve son flambeau à l'ordinaire.

PL 10 This drawing of an Egyptian ? bronze relief appears to have been executed by Ottley himself, copying not the bronze in the Caylus collection, Paris, but from Caylus 1752-67, vi, pl. X. Caylus 1752-67, p. 29, no. 4, describes it thus: l'opération de l'estompe &amp; le peu d'épaisseur de la plaque ont déjà préparé le lecteur a un travail étranger à l'Egypte; aussi je le regarde comme Romain, ainsi que la figure tient d'une main &amp; un oiseau de l'autre, le chien d'ailleurs n'est point du tout Egyptien: cependant le travail &amp; la disposition appartiennent à l'Egypte. Pour accorder ces difficultés, je croirois que ce bronze a été travaillé depuis la conquête des Romains, dans le tems que la culte &amp; les idées du Vainqueur altéroient insensiblement les impressions du culte national. Folio 32, lower left, GR 2006.0515.33 Fig. 3 A Roman horseman with a shield in his left hand and a human head in his right Pen and ink and grey wash; 105 x 120 Inscribed below in ink Ottley's hand: Terra Cota in M Townley' s Collection Inscribed lower left in graphite in a different hand: g 1/2 inches high This drawing of a Campana relief appears to have been executed by Ottley himself. The relief is now in the BM, as part of the Townley Collection, GR 1805.7.3.422; see Walters 1903, p. 405, no. D.622. It is not known where or when Ottley made this copy. Townley had returned home from Italy in 1776. Folio 36, upper left, GR 2006.0515.40 Fig. 4 A veiled matron flanked by two men in togas Pen and ink with grey washes; 176 x 227 Inscribed lower left: IVY. O. dt. ab Orig 1792. Villa Borghese This drawing, signed and dated by Ottley, records a Roman grave relief of unknown provenance in the Museo &amp; Galleria Borghese, Rome; see Kockel 1993, p. 152, no. 17, pl. 66a.c. Folio 36, upper right, GR 2006.0515.41 Fig. 5 A standing female figure, wearing a Phrygian cap and holding a double axe in her left hand Pen and ink; 180 x 150 Inscribed below: from a Sketch by J. Flaxman. WY. O. 1792 This drawing records a Roman marble relief from the Temple of Hadrian at Rome. It is now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples (inv. 6763). See Sapelli 1999, pp. 36~39&gt; no. 5. It represents one of the personified provinces, probably Phrygia. Flaxman's original drawing, which Ottley had copied in 1792 when the two artists were in close contact, has not been located but was undoubtedly made at Rome, around this date. Folio [between 38 and 41], GR 2006.0515.44 Eros and Anteros Engraving; 115 x 171 Inscribed below in graphite: Eros and Anteros from Montfaucon Flaxman had copied the original relief sculpture while travelling through France on the way to Rome in 1787. It was inserted above the entrance to the circular Temple of Love at the Duke de Bouillon's castle, Navarre, near Evreux; and it is now in the Musée d'Evreux (for which see Tevarent 1965, pp. 206-08, with a suggestion that it might be an Italian Renaissance work based on an ancient Roman relief). For Flaxman's drawing which he inscribed as Love and Apathy striving for the palm , see Flaxman, BL Journal, f. 37V and Marchand, ibid., 579</page><page sequence="581">ottley: british museum gr 2006.0515 Cat. no. 4, pl. iv. As Marchand observes, Flaxman probably returned to his drawing in 1791 when working on a commission for drawings after reliefs for Mr Edward Knight in London; the consignment included a Contention of Eros &amp; Antero s (see Yale Sketchbook, f. 8or). This engraving from Ottley's album appears to have been cut from Montfaucon 171 9, 1, p. 194, pl. CXXII. One can only speculate on whether Ottley added this print to the album after seeing Flaxman's drawings. Folio 42, GR 2006.0515.45 Fig. 6 Orestes and Iphigenia with Pylades Pen and ink on oiled tracing paper; 172 x 590 Inscribed lower right in Ottley's hand: Sarcophagus. Palazzo Accorombini [sic] Traced from Flaxman's drawing See below under Folio 43 for identification and description of this Roman sarcophagus. Folio 43, GR 2006.0515.46 Fig. 7 Orestes and Iphigenia with Pylades Pen and ink on oiled tracing paper; 172 x 410 This drawing and Folio 42 together with Folio 44, left and right, together reproduce a sarcophagus from the Palazzo Accoramboni, Rome, which is now at Munich Glyptothek; see Robert in ASR, 11 (1890), pp. 177-79, no. 167, pl. LVII. Folio 43 represents the central left-hand side and folio 42, above, represents the central right- hand side. Folio 44 left completes the composition on the left edge; folio 44 right completes the composition on the right edge. Flaxman was commissioned to make a copy from this sarcophagus for Mr Deveare [sic], as recorded in the Yale Sketchbook, f. 8ov: Pylades &amp; Orestes. Accoramboni. See p. 154 and p. 157 note 17. It seems more than likely that the present tracings, executed by Ottley after Flaxman, record this drawing by Flaxman, the whereabouts of which are unknown. For Devaere, who joined the Flaxmans in Italy in October 1787 and was commissioned by Josiah Wedgwood to work as a modeller with Flaxman, using the latter's drawings, see Ingamells 1996, p. 294; and Marchand in Yale Sketchbook, note 9, and for the Accoramboni sarcophagus, see further his note 17.

WY O The drawing, signed by Ottley, records another fragment (see above under Folio 46 left) from an early third- century ad Roman Hippolytus sarcophagus, seen at the Villa Aldobrandini, Frascati, but since 1815 in the collection of the Dukes of Bedford at Woburn; see Angelicoussis 1992, pp. 84-85, no. 64, pl. 187, no. 276. Angelicoussis, fig. 34, shows a line drawing by C. Robert (ASR, in, 2, pp. 189 f. no. 156, pl. XLIX) illustrating the surviving antique parts of the sarcophagus before restorers added the entire lower half of the relief. This also shows the two fragments seen by Ottley in the correct sequence, with Phaedra on the right. Jörgen Zoega (Roman topography MSS, f. 12 no. 4), cited by Angelicoussis, loc cit., described the two fragments at the Villa Aldobrandini in 1791-92, exactly as we see them in Ottley's copies which were probably made there at about the same date; the fragments remained separated, were displayed in the reverse order and were already 'restored'.

PI. 88 This copy from two out of four relief decorations on a Roman bronze vase appears to have been made by Ottley directly from Caylus 1752-67, 1, p. 217, pl. LXXXVIII, 2 and 3. Folio 78, GR 2006.0515.137 Fig. 13 Pan playing a flute; Dionysus finds Ariadne Black chalk; 133 x 325 Inscribed in ink lower right: Villa Medici- WY. O.delt. ab Orig. 1792 Ottley appears to have made this copy from the right-hand section of a Bacchic sarcophagus, dating from the second century ad, inserted into the garden façade of the Villa Medici, Rome; see Matz in ASR, iv/3 (1969), pp. 378-80, no. 210, pl. 221. Flaxman made a copy of the left-hand section of the same sarcophagus, represent- ing Bacchic scenes; the consecration of a woman for the Bacchic cult. He then drew a detail of Pan playing a flute, but did not continue with the scene of the finding of Ariadne, although he had left blank space on the folio which might have accommodated it. It is not impossible that Ottley and Flaxman made their respective copies side by side together and that Flaxman was content to leave responsibility for the right-hand scene to his companion.
