<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW THE ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADTIAH GAON. THE period between the conclusion of the Babylonian Talmud and the activity of the last Geonim, extending from the sixth till the ninth century, although not totally desti- tute of literary documents, is yet one of the most obscure epochs in Jewish history. That space of time was, never- theless, of vast importance for the intellectual life of Judaism. The period comprises the activity of the Massoretes, the intro- duction of our system of punctuation, the production of a number of Midrashim, and a series of mystical writings. The liturgy assumes fixed forms 1, and-which is of special importance-in the second half of that period new doctrines arise, diverging from official, traditional Judaism, and new sects spring up. It is true, many of these sects hardly survived their authors, yet many of them succeeded in living, at least for some time; whilst one of them, that of the Karaites, continues to exist even to the present day. The period also was productive of many riddles, that have not been solved even yet, one of which is the attitude of the Geonim towards the Karaite doctrines. These official representatives of the Judaism of the day, did nothing to avert the danger that threatened from the part of the Karaites. They neither tried to warn the people against the opinions of the Karaites, nor did they endeavour to regain the apostate sectarians for traditional Judaism, or to rebut the Karaite teachers. Nor is it certain that the 1 The fixing of our constant calendar dates also probably from that time.

It is a fact, that the name of 'Anan appears only once in the whole literature before Saadiah, in a responsum of Natronai b. Hillai, and the passage proves that the latter knew 'Anan's code of laws only from hearsay3. The only Gaon, perhaps, who, before Saadiah, entered occasionally upon the attacks of the Karaites, was Ilai b. David 4. We are, as I mentioned before, too little acquainted with the internal history of the Judaism of that period, to be able to discover and form a judgment on the motives by which the Geonim were guided. If the Geonim were of opinion that the movement would be nipped in the bud by being ignored, or that the heresy was only a transient phenomenon, incapable of striking root among the people, and that, in consequence, it was superfluous to combat it-if they thought this, they were thoroughly mistaken. Karaism is still in existence, after more than a thousand years, although its condition is only a poor one. During the first century of its existence, however, the movement seems to have made proselytes among the Rabbanites, so that even Sahl b. Mazliach and Tobia b. Moses mention Rabbanites, who subsequently joined the Karaites 5. But the work that had been neglected by the Geonim of Babylon, was taken up with great ardour by a young scholar of Egypt, namely Saadiah al-Fajjumi. When a young man of twenty-three, he stood up as an opponent ' Cf. Schorr, Hechaluz, VI, 70 sqq. 2 Vid.

His appointment as Gaon at Sora he owed, probably, in part to his activity in that direction, in spite of the usage that had been hitherto in force, to give that dignity only to a scholar from the school of the Geonim 2. Later authorities were also grateful to him for his having made a stand against heresy in general, and against the Karaites in particular3, and Moses di Rieti opens the Paradise for Saadiah for his polemics against the Sectarians 4. Besides the polemical dissertation against 'Anan, Saadiah also wrote some other anti-Karaite works, none of which has been preserved. I shall now try to fix the number and contents of such works from quotations that are still extant 5. I. The first anti-Karaite work of Saadiah, was, as already said, his polemical essay against 'Anhn, entitled 1 Vid. infra. 2 I say "in part," for there is no doubt that the fame of his other writings, which he composed in Egypt, had come as far as Babylonia. It is even said that in the year 92I a question was directed to him from Babylonia, for the purpose of refuting the dicta of a certain Ben Meir in reference to the Festivals. Vid.

Before that time, Dukes (Beitrdge, &amp;c, II, 32, 33) and Steinschneider (Cat. Bodl., cols. 2165-2I68) gave a list of those writings. The latter compiled methodi- cally and exhaustively everything that was known on the subject before i86o, and my exposition was partly based on his. But I was obliged to differ from him on many points, and most particularly in the arrange- ment of the writings, in consequence of fresh material, and many additions. 240</page><page sequence="4">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH GAON 241 1pY tYV 'Ti' ~nt, written in his twenty-third yer, i.e. 9I5.

The essay is, as far as I know, cited by name only by Saadiah himself in his Commentary to Gen. viii. 3, and to Lev. xxiii. I5. The former passage, quoted by Jefeth b. 'Ali in his Commentary ad loc., reads as follows3: .n D1 r, nt rn3 &lt;:i t p rin3n Dos p n:nn y nJnrwi , i,niwn 1 *isy ZN5% Nn }IDx n 5]Dpi 1nwn *5y i5 s 5 -ivN zDm 1s nil v S K}m iN56b rhK ty. 'Anan inferred from the circumstance that the Flood lasted five months--50 days-that, whenever the moon was invisible from any cause whatever, the month had always thirty days, without any regard to the preceding months; for Noah counted the five months as 150 days, because he could not see the new moon in the Ark. Saadiah refuted that view at great length4. The other passage, also quoted by Jefeth ad loc., reads thus: 'K .r D0I ',n wn'n v1? r,nip nm,:N nini npIrS ,1n n , num ID n tZ,n 53 IxY n 1w5 DDn5 714) IN :88X inmlW$ 4z IKnn ,51P5 UXD: I824 1N2N INn nD lnidj Nnsnn~ns wp s:nsi n N,onn v53: nfii wn aN ,il ' ' ' ' ? 15i 1i$ 'ny 3v) qn'1 3SnM *D.

Whether the report in tr:n1l tmnwpn pmln (Pinsker, p. 103), in the name of a Rab- banite, as to the low motives that induced 'AnOn to come forward, and the objectionable means he employed, is directly copied from this writing of Saadiah, as Pinsker3 and Harkavy 4 assume, must remain an open question, for we have no exact information about the authorship, the time, and the trustworthiness of that Karaite chronicle . It must however be observed, that it is expressly stated in an old Karaite commentary to Exodus, which Harkavy thinks was written by Sahl b. Mazliach, that Saadiah accused'AnAn that the only reason the latter had for fixing the new moon from observation was a desire to flatter the Caliphs 6. Saadiah was also called the author of the same accusation in a Karaite fragment7, whose author, as Frankl proved8, was not Tobia b. Moses, but Jehudah Hadassi. We learn from that fragment, that Ben-Mashiach had already written on this subject against Saadiah. At all events, the fact that no other author, except Saadiah himself, quotes this controversial writing by name, sufficiently proves that must have been lost already at a very early date.

The following points are, as far as I know, those about which Saadiah wrote against 'AnOn. Qirqis&amp;ni, in the 29th chapter of the eleventh section of his Kitab al-'Anwdr, gives information about Saadiah's controversy against 'AnOn on the subject of the prohibited degrees of relationship1. Such controversy could have been contained in the pamphlet under discussion, QirqisAni having been a younger contemporary of Saadiah, and having undoubtedly known it. On the other hand, it is possible that it was contained in Saadiah's Commentary to the Pentateuch or in his nWri -mo. Saadiah's repudiation of 'AnAn's opinion, that an animal, which dies before it is eight days old, did not defile, was quoted and confuted at length in the MS. of a Karaite Commentary of Leviticus in Arabic, of the year 1050 2. But in this case also, Saadiah's Commentary of the Pentateuch may have been the source. This is, probably, also the case with another controversy of Saadiah against 'Anan on the subject of the laws of menstruation, as cited in another MS. of an Arabic Commentary of Leviticus (MS. Brit. Mus. Or. 2595, f. 182 b)3. No more can it be said with certainty, in which of his books Saadiah wrote against 'Anan on the subject of forbidden fat, a controversy particularly dealt with by Tobia b. Moses in his rim X1X4, on the conception and application of nptn 5, and on 'Anan's prohibition of eating meat in the Diaspora . Moses Ibn Ezra relates also in his Cf. Steinschneider-Festschrift, p. 201. 2 Cf. ibid., pp. 209, 2I5- 3 Only fragments of this Commentary have been preserved (Lev. xi. i- xv. 25). No one is cited there except 'Anan and Saadiah. 4 Vid.

Hadassi, Eshkol Hakkofer, Alphab. 236, letter i sqq. Saadiah combats that view in his Commentary to Daniel (communicated by Mathews in his edition of the Comm. on Ezra and Nehemiah by R. Saadiah,</page><page sequence="7">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Art of Poetry, that'Anan was mistaken in his views about the application to the laws of the Torah, of the method of Analogy (oDbp, w'pn), and that Saadiah confuted them in several of his works. He then cites a passage from Saadiah's commentary to the section nwnlqp, in which, however, 'Anan is not mentioned . It is hardly possible that Moses Ibn Ezra was still in possession of Saadiah's pamphlet, and that it is this he alludes to. Saadiah quotes also and confutes in his philosophical work 2, a view of 'An&amp;n's about the seat of the soul, but does so without any animosity. It is not likely that Saadiah treated this point also in his polemical work, otherwise he would undoubtedly have quoted the latter, as he does in his polemic against Hiwi-al-Balchi. Besides, in his controversy against 'Anan, he probably confined himself to questions of the Law. Should, however, the passage from the Commentary, attributed to Sahl, and from the xnnl tsmqpn plin, also have occurred there, the inference would be that Saadiah's attack against 'Anin not only had reference to the controversial topics, but was also directed against 'AnAn in person. It follows from all that has been said here, that it is impossible to gain an accurate notion of the contents of this pamphlet of Saadiah. 2. But the most important and voluminous work against the Karaites seems to have been the tss14ni1Nb :n (Hebrew: n' M,nn '*. or Irlnan D), "the Book of Dis- tinction." This work was written in the year 926, there- Preface, p. xvi, and by D. S. Margoliouth in his edition of Jefeth to Daniel, Preface, p. vii), without mentioning 'Anan. It is possible that Saadiah treated this point also in his polemical writing against 'Anan. Cf. also my remarks in the Monatsschrift, XXXIX, 443, and in Steinschneider- Festschrift, p. 204.

The few pas- sages that are preserved show also that almost all points of divergence between Rabbanites and Karaites were dis- cussed in it; thus, questions referring to the calendar (Jefeth to Gen. i. 14, xlix. I4; Exod. xii. I; Lev. xxiii. 5; Deut. xvi. i, xxxiii. 8 ; i Sam. xx. 27) which must have formed the greatest portion of the controversial matter; further, questions about the lighting of light on Sabbath (Jefeth to Deut. xxv. 4, and Ibn Ezra to Exod. xxxv. 3); about the date of the Feast of Weeks (Jefeth to Lev. xxiii. 15), and about the validity of the Tradition (Moses Ibn Ezra). According to Steinschneider, it was particularly Salmon b. Jerucham and Jeshua b. Jehuda, that wrote against this work. In reference to the latter, we possess only a small part of his comments against Saadiah, and of Salmon b. Jerucham, I have already shown that he probably did no such thing. Gratz's opinion that this work of Saadiah's was a reply to Salmon's attacks, I have already shown, both from historical and chronological data, to be impossible1. 3. Another anti-Karaite work of Saadiah, of which it is not known, when it was written, is the ^hY 1'1% 1wn3 ;1'p1D pt:, "Writing in confutation of Ibn Saqije (or SAqeveihi)."

Suppose this passage had been taken from the r-nK 3=n3,, Abraham b. Chija would not have omitted quoting that book by name (nn;rn nw), as he does on another occasion (vid. supra, p. 245). We do not know who this Ibn Saqhje was , but so much is certain that he was a Karaite, and this is sufficient to refute Lebrecht's assumption, that he was identical with the Exilarch David ben Zakkai2. Pinsker is of opinion that the first name of this Karaite was Samuel, but this assumption is, as was shown already, based upon a misunder- stood and badly translated passage of Joseph al-Basir's N_ntD qKN 3Nn 3.

This book is, without doubt, the same as the one cited by Jehuda b. Barzilai in two places of his Com- mentary on Jezira (ed. Halberstam, pp. 20, 34). In the former passage it is said expressly, that a heretic asserted of the Talmudists, that they attributed to the Creator form and shape, and that Saadiah, in a book written for the purpose, refuted these attacks. By these heretics he means, of course, Karaites, for none of them, from Qirqisani and Salmon b. Jerucham till Mordechai b. Nissan and Abraham Firkowitsch, fail to attack the Talmudists, on the ground of anthropomorphic passages of the Agada, which they take in their literal meaning, induced thereto either by ignorance or malice. And these very two passages of the Agada, the interpretation of which are cited by Jehuda b. Barzilai, were attacked by the two older Karaites, named before. The one (p. 2o), about the vision of Ishmael, mentioned in Berachot, 7 a, is quoted by Salmon b. Jerucham l, the other (p. 34), about the passage pl? eanno n,"p,rW, is quoted by this author 2, and by QirqisAni3. But it must be observed that, whilst QirqisAni directs his attacks against the Rabbanites in general, Salmon, in his flippant way, attacks Saadiah personally, and makes him responsible for whatever he finds fault with. I have already said that Saadiah wrote this pamphlet after the Erunoth, and therefore after 933 4. 5. Ibn Ezra makes, in two passages of his commentary, mention of a dispute of Saadiah with the otherwise unknown Ben Zuta. The first passage (Exod. xxi. 24) deals with the lex talionis, and the second (Lev. xxiii. i5, Cap. 15, letter D. 2 Ibid., letter 2. 3 Kitb al-'Anwdr I, 4 (ed. Harkavy, p. 298).

Ben Zuta not being quoted by any of the Karaite writers, it is probable that the source of Ibn Ezra was Saadiah, and most likely the latter's com- mentary on the Pentateuch. I shall endeavour to show in another place that Ibn Ezra's other quotations of Ben Zuta's opinions (Commentary to Exod. ii. 2, xx. 23, xxi. 35, xxii. 28; nmyr iw f. 7 a) were all taken from Saadiah, and that all of them were subjects of controversy between the latter and the former'. 6. Besides the above-mentioned special writings, Saadiah combated the Karaites also in his large commentary on the Pentateuch. He says, in the preface to his second translation of the Pentateuch, with so many words, that he was asked to reproduce the simple meaning of the words of Scripture, without linguistic digressions or polemics against the heretics 2. As a matter of fact, some remnants of Saadiah's polemic, taken from that commen- tary, have been preserved. Salmon, in his controversy, informs us that Saadiah had produced, in his commentary on Genesis, seven proofs of the necessity and divine character of the Tradition . Jefeth ben 'Ali also cites 1 Vid. my "Miscellanies on Saadiah," II (Monatsschrift, XLI, 203-2I2), where the proofs can be found for all that is brought forward here. 2 Ed.

Tobia b. Moses, in his nzm nrv, cites a passage from Saadiah's commentary to Exod. xxiv. 12, in which the divine character of the Mishna and Talmud is vindicated 3, and another passage from the commentary to Leviticus, in which the Karaite notions about prohibited fat are confuted4. Moses ibn Ezra communicates, in his Art of Poetry, a passage from Saadiah's commentary to the section ?w/lnp, in which 'An&amp;n's method in reference to the applica- tion of the inference by analogy (Dfp, Wp,ln) is combated5. Finally, we have already pointed out the probability that many controversial passages against 'AnAn, and also against Ben Zuta, were contained in the commentary on the Pentateuch. 7. Saadiah, in his philosophical work, cites, it is true, an opinion of'Anan and Benjamin-al-Nahawendi, which he confutes 6, but without any polemical heat, and, on the whole, he abstains in that work from all controversy with the Karaites. Of only two passages, in which he speaks of the opinions of "people who call themselves Jews," or "who are called Jews" (;inDn ; lD m-p' * nvpll wip'W tw ,;lnm1,mn), I believe that I have shown that a section of the 1 Cf.

The assumption that the second version of the seventh chapter, on the resurrection of the dead, on which Ibn Tibbon's translation was based, was directed specially against the same portion of the Karaites is, as recently shown by Bacher2, plausible enough. Yet, as already said, a direct controversy against the Karaites is not to be found in the work. Several scholars have tried to explain this circumstance. Thus Kaufmann3 believes the absence of all controversy to be attributable to Saadiah's consideration of Mahommedan readers, to whom he wished to represent Judaism as an undivided unit, without schism. But this suggestion is unacceptable, because contro- versy, both against Islam and against erroneous exegetical doctrines within Judaism, is by no means a rare thing in Emnunoth 4. More plausible is Guttmann's view5, adopted also by Bacher, that there was no room in Emunoth for any polemic against the Karaites, in as far as the latter were in accord with the Rabbanites on the fundamental ideas that form the subject of the book. But this explanation is not quite satisfactory either, for the belief in the divine origin of the Tradition was to Saadiah a fundamental principle also. We shall have to rest for the present without an explanation. But the work mentioned above, under No. 4, and which was written after Emnunoth, shows that Saadiah, even when advanced in years, had not lost his readiness for controversy. 8. As far as I have found, no controversy against the Karaites occurs in the other, still extant, writings of Saad- iah's. It is true that Schechter 6 suggested that Saadiah's Vid. my " Miscellanies on Saadiah," I (Monatsschrift, XXXIX, 44I-446). 2 Steinschneider-Festschrift, p. 224. s Gesch. d.

Ishmael may have had an anti-Karaite tendency, but this conjecture is not supported by a single passage of the book.

I also conjectured before, under No. I, that Saadiah s polemic against incest was perhaps contained in that book. (b) On the margin of a MS. in Oxford (Cod. Pococke, 256, Cat. Neubauer, 1533), a work of Saadiah is quoted under the title of ynoDD ry's5 y npw iR 8n3, which Lebrecht designates, without any foundation, as an apologetical and polemical work 4. But Steinschneider correctly identifies it as Saadiah's work y'sNnw ~ rinn zbn: fi,nt~ , quoted by Moses ibn Ezra6, and it is, without doubt, identical with the swi's~ =Nn mentioned in the Fihrist. Several conjectures were made in respect to that work, and Bacher proposed to identify it with the Kitdb al-'aqxnandt . Munk's opinion appears to be the only correct one, namely, that it was a compendium of laws (nrin io), 1 Vid. Steinschneider-Festschrift, p. 2o8. 2 The whole passage was also reprinted with explanatory notes by Joel Miiller in Saadiah's (Euvres completes, 1. c., pp. 171-173. 3 Vid.

Although no anti-Karaite matter occurs in either of these quotations, yet it is more than likely that Saadiah had in this book frequent opportunities of defending the Tradition and attacking the Karaites. (c) jrnNK linl '1 = irn3. This work is also mentioned in Fihrist, and its subject was, as the title shows, probably, the Knowledge of the Calendar and the Jewish Chronology. The little we know about it was collected by Rapoport2, Luzzatto 3, and Steinschneider 4. The work being quoted mostly by authors who wrote in Hebrew, none of whom mentioned its title, Luzzatto is of opinion, that Saadiah had written it in Hebrew, under the title of nuyn nnri, a name which Ibn Nedim translated into Arabic by ninyr min, to which he added jnn5 isv ni, for the better understanding of his Arabic readers5. Luzzatto further assumes that the book was unknown to Abraham b. Chija, since he never quotes it. In the absence of fuller information, nothing positive can be asserted; yet it must be observed that Ibn Balam, in his Arabic commentary to i Kings vi. I, reproduces a passage from Saadiah's jnrnS nKn:, which certainly deals with chronology 6. It is also more than probable that the passage quoted by Abraham b. Chija in name of Isaak b. Baruch was, as the contents show, taken from this book. The t,rnS 3nrn could also be thought of in this connexion, but Abraham b. Chija would not, in that case, have omitted quoting it by name, as he knew this book 1 JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, VI, 707. It is certainly possible, also, that the words 'swnt 'D rar4 'D mTr 5p cited there, do not allude to Saadiah, but to isprn 1n, who is also mentioned there. 2 Biography of Saadiah, note 23. 3 Orient, XII, 10I-I03; I32-134. 4 Cat.

It follows, at all events, that the nvnS, nNn was no longer known to Abraham b. Chija. If we do not assume that Ibn BalAm had translated the Hebrew title into Arabic, his citation leads to the conclusion that Saadiah wrote this, like all his other works, in Arabic. Rashi's quotation, Rosh Hashana, 2o b1, proves nothing, for he either may have quoted from a Hebrew extract, or he may have meant another book 2. Nor are there any sufficient grounds for explaining why Saadiah should have written this particular book in Hebrew3. The Genizot in Egypt, which constantly supply fresh surprises, will perhaps still throw some light on this matter, and we have, perhaps, even now already a fragment of this work before us. It is, at any rate, more than probable, that Saadiah combated the Karaites in this very book, since questions in connexion with the knowledge of the Calendar are, so to say, the perpetuum mobile in the polemics between Saadiah and the Karaites. 9. We have seen that all Saadiah's anti-Karaite writings, with the exception of a few scanty fragments, are lost without leaving any trace. But a little fragment from one of them may, perhaps, have been rescued, namely, two loose sheets, contained in a Codex of Fragments in the Bodleian Library (MS. Hebr. 45, fol. 1-2), and which have come from Egypt, like all recent acquisitions made by the Library. I shall first communicate both text and translation of these two sheets, I tS1D :rrw 50a lNlD' 'nn 1. 2 The same is the case with the lr,D on lp :, cited by Rashi to Ps. xlv. 1o. 3 In regard to those books of Saadiah that were written in Hebrew, we also know a reason for their having been composed in that language; thus, the lin nD and the o'irin .oT, because Saadiah wished to present them in Biblical garb, with vowel-points and accents (vid. Harkavy, Stud. u. Mittheil., V, 133 sqq.. 212 sqq.). He could not have written his polemic against Chivi al-Balchi in Arabic, vid. the quotation from Bachja's Ma'ani al-nafs, in Revue des ltudes Juives, XXV, 249 (cf., on this point, Kanfmann, ibid., XXVII, 271; in Broyde's translation of z:n; nrvn, p. 2o, n,ar must be altered into nna, and nma into n1av.

[a] His error lay in the verse: ' The word of God came by the prophet Haggai, saying' (Hag. ii. I), and he erroneously thought, as we said already, that both dates 'the 24th of the sixth month' (ibid. i. I5) and 'the 21st of the seventh month' (ibid. ii. r) were identical, and referred to two different sorts of months. He thought the former to refer to the solar, and the latter to the lunar month. But he did not know, that these two dates, the 24th and the 2 st, are two different days, falling in two consecutive muonths, and that a different event occurred on each of them. For the words Ion the 24th' [&amp;c.] are the con- tinuation of the preceding verse: ' and they came and did 264 1 Perhaps lwn'p. 2 MS. a:kzr. 3 MS. !S=,D.</page><page sequence="28">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH GAON 265 work in the house of the Lord Zebaoth their God' (i. I4). Thus, they commenced building on the 24th of Elul, and continued till the 2ist of Tishri. On that very day, the day of the 'Ardba, God said to Haggai: 'Speak to them: Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory, and how do you see it now, is it not in your eyes as nothing?' (ii. 3). We have thus made it clear that the 24th of Elul must refer to the preceding verse, but the 2ist of Tishri refers to that which follows. The words of him, therefore, who considers these two dates to mean the same day, and who bases his opinion upon doubtful and weak arguments, are of no value 1. "Now Tiflisi-and many of his contemporaries follow him-keeps to the reckoning of the Calendar; only, he thinks that the end of the minutes of every month was, at the same time, the day of the order [of the new month ?] 2. 1 This passage seems to be directed against the assertion that the Bible reckons also according to the solar months. Jehuda ha-Parsi is here perhaps alluded to, who taught that we had to reckon by solar months, as mentioned by Ibn Ezra (Introduction to the Commentary on the Penta- teuch; Comm. to Gen. viii. 3; Exod. xii. i; Lev. xxv. 9; Sefer ha-Ibbur, 8 a; Iggeret ha-Shabbath, in Kerem Chemed, IV, I63). Ibn Ezra does not, however, quote the proof from Hag. i. 15 and ii. i. It is remarkable that the older Karaites inform us, that among the Sadducees every month had thirty days, and that they, consequently, had solar months, thus, e. g. al-Qirqisani, Kitdb al-'anwar, I, 7 (ed. Harkavy, p. 304; and, probably, thence Hadassi, Alphab. 97, letter n), Jefeth to Lev. xxiii. 5: DTM nmn ji5 rr"-np wb nronto Dr;nrirW tnir in:3 DTorm (m'pri2 p 'a). I hope shortly to return to this subject. 2 The name of this sectarian was Musa al-Zafrani, or'Abu 'Imran at- Tiflisi. He was from Bagdad, and emigrated to Tiflis. Vid. about him, QirqisAni, ed. Harkavy, pp. 285, 315 (Hadassi, Alphab. 98, letter s, has, incorrectly, 1pnu:).

For [he bases his assertion] upon arguments, and not upon tradition. To the question 'Whence has he got this opinion?' he and his adhe- rents can only answer that they compared [the month] with a boy born only a minute before the end of the day. That day counts for a whole day, and his circumcision takes place [i b] on the corresponding [eighth] day. In the same way, if a woman at the time of her menstruation, sees [symptoms] at the end of the day, that -day counts for a whole day; the same rule applies to other cases of unclean- liness. But his opponents can reply: Before you conclude suchl analogies, tell. us first, what proof you have in regard to the time of the end [of the m-onth], and what do you know about the duration of the month, which is 291 days and a- certain number of parts [of an hour] 1 No artifice remains him wherewith to defend himself, except one of .j5 riint)5 L-i- 5. in reference to Tiflisi, he continues: r=In .

Either he appeals to the Bible, but there he finds nothing on the subject ; or he appeals to observation [of the moon] and the consideration [of that which was observed], as the astronomers do. But this calculation [of his] has nothing in common with the astronomers, for it is in harmony, neither with the mean nor with the corrected circuit of the moon; he must there- fore leave astronomy alone. Only a third alternative remains him, namely, when he says: ' Thus it was delivered to the Israelites by the Messenger [Moses].' Should he resort to this argument, the answer would be this. The bearers of the tradition maintain on the contrary that the Messenger commanded that we should take care to ter- minate the whole year at the commencement of Tishri, in order that we utilize here these conditions for the purpose of analogy (?). He has, therefore, made it clear to us, that we need not be concerned about anything [else], in reference to the months which either precede or follow [Tishri]. If you are a Jew, and adhere to these bearers of the tradition, [know] that such is their opinion; but if you have others who transmit a different transmission, quote them to us in order that we may respect them. This he cannot do. But if he can adduce no proof for his assertion, it falls to the ground, and we have enough of his analogies and we need not refute him any further. " We have in our midst yet another class of people, who regulate their festivals according to the [first appearance of the] new moon, and believe nevertheless that they proceed after the methods of the Rabbanites. [They say] that the first teachers among the Rabbanites proceeded in the same way, that they convened an assembly of the people, and caused witnesses to come, whom they cross-examined. If they approved of the evidence, they sanctified [the new month], and proclaimed: ' Sanctified!' In the same way 1 We know from Jefeth that Tiflisi quotes Ps. lxxxi. 4 for his theory.</page><page sequence="31">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW they kindled, when they were certain of the first appearance of the moon . . .1 ". .. .[ a] but if he belongs neither to this, nor to the other class, but keeps [only] to the Bible, in that case the [present] exposition applies to him more than to all others. For we have in the Bible many similar phrases; for instance, the word of the prophet [David]: ' If I ascend to heaven, thou art there,' &amp;c. (Ps. cxxxix. 8), but it is impossible for anybody to ascend to the heaven; similarly, the word of God: 'Though they dig into grave,' &amp;c. (Am. ix. 2), but it is impossible to hide in the damp; also, the word of God to Esau: 'Though thou mount on high as an eagle and fix thy nest among the stars,' &amp;c. (Obad. 4); also the word to Jechoniah: 'Though Coniahu the son of Jehoiakim were the signet upon my right hand' (Jer. xxii. 24); also, ' Were Moses and Samuel to place themselves before me' (ib. xv. I), but they could place themselves before God only by his permission. In the same way the leprosy of build- ings and clothes is described, although it does not occur at all. All such phrases must be taken as hyperbolical expressions, and thus must the dicta of the sages of blessed memory in the Mishna be understood 2. Namely, the latter wanted only to give [theoretical] decisions in case people would wish [to know them]. In proof I also adduce here the opinions of the logicians and dialecticians, in order to show that there are many who express themselves in an hyper- bolical manner on things which have no existence in reality. Thus is the man, who slandered our sages, refuted, and his opinions rejected. 1 The passages in Rosh Hashana, II, are alluded to. Thus, this class, which kept to the Tradition, believed nevertheless, that the first appear- ance of the new moon ought still to be observed, and that the months and festivals ought to be fixed accordingly. They also rejected the constantly fixed Calendar. Nothing else is known of that class, but vid. infra, p. 273, note i. 2 On the expressions used here to denote "hyperbolical," ,san and ,nan, which are not found in the Arabic dictionaries, I hope to treat shortly in another place. 268</page><page sequence="32">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH GAON 269 " The same sect also often puts the question, why it should be impossible for Nissan to fall on a Monday, or a Wed- nesday, or a Friday ? We should like, in the first place, to adduce [in reply to that question] something from tradition, which thou [0 reader!] wilt find correct, if thou wilt bring into thy recollection. God has made manifest his will in reference to the Marcheshvan and Kislev and [consequently] the whole year by this, that he made the number of days of the week an uneven number, and fixed for every [week?] that which we mentioned already. Through this the months . . .reciprocally, and they follow each other, as they should (?) 1. Namely, once something was fixed in regard to these two months by the fixed norm [of the Calendar(?)], there is no possibility either to add to or to detract anything from the other months, for by it the other ten are already fixed. If this be so, it is also correct to assume that Nissan or Tishri . . .2 Now it has been computed, that Nissan is never to fall on an even number but on anL uneven number of days, namely, on the first, the third, the fifth, and the seventh [day of the week]. As little as it is possible to divide 50 by 7 in even portions, or 25 by 4, this being against the rules of arithmetic, as impossible it is for the computation [of the Calendar] to bring it about that Nissan fall on an even number of the days of the week. " I will also adduce something from the Bible, and point first the following premises which are in accordance with 1 This sentence is not quite intelligible, and the word nlun makes no sense. Prof. Steinschneider thinks that some form of the verb "n is concealed here. At all events, the author means to say, that by means of the fixing on every occasion of Marcheshvan and Kislev-the only months that have no uniform number of days-the other ten months follow each other in turns, and by a fixed law, alternately defective (nDn) and plene (s5n). 2 The word )t'rm makes no sense either. We must perhaps read Isn,, "Nissan or Tishri are extended," i. e. somebody thought that these two months, and not Marcheshvan and Kislev, could alter their number of days. But the word wnr in the sense of "stretching" is in Arabic used in a different sense. Or is, perhaps, the Hebrew word tnr concealed in wrn', and the text not quite correct.</page><page sequence="33">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the Law, viz. whenever God reveals one commandment before another, the second can never annul the first; the second can apply only to cases which are not included in the first. Thus, for instance, circumcision was [revealed] before the Sabbath, and God commanded us to perform the circumcision on any day. When, afterwards, the command- ment was given to observe the Sabbath, it cannot be applied to circumcision so as to annul it. In the same way, burnt-offerings were commanded to be brought on the Sabbath, therefore the offerings were brought on every day and the Sabbath did not interfere with them. In the same way, the Paschal offering was ordained before the observ- ance of the Sabbath, therefore it could be brought also on the Sabbath. But such commandments as were revealed after the commandment of the Sabbath may not be fulfilled on the Sabbath. We therefore say, since we see that God (he is mighty and strong!) gave us commandments for the festivals, which must necessarily be observed on them, he fixed them for those days only for this reason, that he knew, that they should not fall on a Sabbath; for, in that case, we should be unable to fulfil them, as having been ordained after the Sabbath. From this we can infer that the reckoning of the Calendar, revealed to us by his Messenger ..." The reasons that induce me to attribute this fragment to Saadiah are as follows : I. The tenor of the whole fragment points to a defence of the Calendar and its authority. We know that Saadiah all along maintained, in opposition to the Karaites, that the Jewish Calendar, with all its laws and regulations, was of remote antiquity, a point on which he was not only contra- dicted by the Karaites, but also by the Rabbanites (Hai Gaon, Isaac b. Baruch, Abraham Ibn Ezra, Maimonides, &amp;c.)1. His opinion was only followed by Chananel b. Chushiel 2, Vid. Responses of the Geonim, ed. Lyck, No. i; Abraham b. Chija's -iD ~n:n, 59, 94; Ibn Ezra on Lev. xxiii. 3; Maimuni, n"nrp inj5n, V, 3; Israeli, Jesod Olam, IV, 6. 2 Migdal Chananel, p. 32. 270</page><page sequence="34">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH GAON 271 Meshullamn b. Kalonymos , and Obadiah b. David2. But not one of these latter can have been the author of our fragment, even only for the reason that they wrote nothing but Hebrew. 2. Saadiah, in consequence of this theory of his, was also compelled to maintain, that all the Postponements (rnn) were also of the same ancient origin, and that, therefore, the Passover, for instance, never could have fallen on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, in accordance with the well-known rule nDt i:i mS. And on this point also he was contradicted, not only by all Karaites, but also by many Rabbanites. When it was objected, that many passages in the Talmud showed nevertheless, that the Passover fell on one of these days, e.g. the Mishna Sabbath, xv, 3; Pesachim, viii, o; Chagiga, ii, 4; Menachot, xi, 7, &amp;c., Saadiah answered, that, in these passages, the question was discussed only theo- retically, namely, what was to be done, suppose the Passover fell on one of these days. For, Saadiah said, it is nowhere written that Passover actually fell on one of those days. But here also his opponents could show him the passage: n:r2 nM,r nvn% y r w rla 5n nnr nry (Tosefta, Sukka, III, Babli, 43 b) 8. Of all Karaites, it was Salmon b. Jerucham, who had collected the greatest number of arguments against Saadiah, having devoted chaps. 4-6 of his controversial writing to this subject 4. He uses several passages to show that Saadiah had not only gone against the Karaites, but also against his own authorities, and there says of him (chap. 5): m':mn mln [4 mn5lzntD *nr Inn *lin a.

Baruch), and that they must be taken in the same way as Obad. 4. Now, we find at the beginning of the second leaf of our fragment that the author, to prove an hyperbolical interpretation of Talmudic passages, quotes, inter alia, also Obad. 4, and we may assume from the whole, that such passages from the Talmud are here alluded to, as were quoted by Salmon b. Jerucham, and Isaac b. Baruch. 3. At the end of the first leaf we read, that the class of persons who still fixed their months by the first appearance of the moon maintained that they stood, notwithstanding, on Rabbinical ground, their first teachers having proceeded in the same way, &amp;c. It would appear fromi this, as if the author of the fragment doubted these facts, as mentioned in readings from other MSS. are also recorded. I consider ift unnecessary for our present purpose to give here all those variations. I From chap. 6. 272</page><page sequence="36">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH GAON 273 the Mishnah! But we know that Saadiah asserted, that the new moons had always been fixed by calculation, and that they commenced summoning witnesses, &amp;c., only after Zadok and Boethos and others had maintained that the Torah enjoined to fix the new moons by observation; and that they did so for the purpose of showing that calculation and observation coincided . The above cited passage becomes only thus intelligible. 4. We read further in the fragment that a divine precept cannot be annulled by another and subsequent one, and that circumcision must take place, and the two daily burnt-offer- ings be brought on the Sabbath, because these commandments were anterior to that of the Sabbath. We find the same idea in Saadiah's philosophical work. The Gaon speaks there of the impossibility of abrogating the Law (rtwri jio) and says, that there is much which apparently admits of abrogation, but that it is not really the case. Thus are the offerings and the circumcision on the Sabbath no abrogation, because they were commanded before the Sabbath: 5'1 j::n DS Kswbs&lt; s, ilD inySK biDnn nyl nroo^ *a tn MpSK rnpn c^s n3bSD imp n:X: lsmnp5s ,W"^yt, 185 i:zID ;Dn 8n1 DD' 1;5i 5DY pKK CFr3 mbnn na lODJ 5 t m n3D^S ,n3)s: n nenn t7 tis 2n,rhp t:pnriK n^n5i tsm3p98 RS. 5. Our fragment further shows that such work as was prohibited the Sabbath, may under no circumstance be done on the Sabbath. If, then, God commanded several things to be done on the festivals that were prohibited to be done on the Sabbath, he must have intended that these festivals should not fall on the Sabbath. Here, unfor- Vid. my Miscellanies on Saadiah, II (1. c., 209). May not the asser- tion that the new moon should be observed, in spite of the tradition, be connected with the action taken by Ben Meir, who, at the time of Saadiah, wanted to re-establish the authority of Palestine in regard to the fixing of the festivals ? (vid. JEWISH QUARTERLY REVJEW, IX, 36-38). In that case, another proof could be found for Saadiah's authorship of our fragment. 2 Kitcb al-'amanat, ed. Landauer, I36 (ed. Slucki, 70).</page><page sequence="37">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW tunately, the fragment stops; the author alluded probably to some such case as the bringing of offerings of rejoicing on the Feast of Weeks. And this case is really adduced by Isaac b. Baruch, in the name of Saadiah, as an argu- ment for his theory, vid. 1nyn 'Io, p. 60: m vnmi 1 pI?

The parallel passages quoted here, which may perhaps be added to in course of time, raise the assumption of Saadiah's authorship to a degree of probability, approaching certainty. The question then arises, to which of his works does it belong? If my above-mentioned conjecture be correct, that Isaac b. Baruch's writing was based on Saadiah's "m:lPS Nn:, it would be obvious to suggest that work, for such questions as solar and lunar months are also treated there; further, several theories of the Calendar, such as those of 'Abi 'ImrAn at-Tiflisi, and others, are dealt with. But it is also possible that it was part of an anti-Karaite book of Saadiah's, and, in that case, the rtDnni zrn: would suggest itself, in which the question of the age of the Calendar and its rules are dwelt on at length. We submit our conjecture for the approval of experts; if they consider it to be correct, it would be an important gain for the history of Jewish literature. We have seen that Saadiah was the first great teacher of Judaism, who opposed the Karaites by special writings, but he was also the last. Of the Geonim that came after him, it was only Samuel b. Chofni who casually combats the Karaites, but he has written no special work on the subject 1. Nothing anti-Karaite is, as far as I know, found in the works of the last two celebrated Geonim, Sherira and Hai2. Nor was any one found among the Vid. Harkavy, Stud. u. Mittheil., III, 6, 7; 44-47. 2 The responsum, nvzwn rw, No. 34, is not of Hai, as Weiss (1. c., IV, 189) assumes, for Chananel is quoted there. 274</page><page sequence="38">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH GAON 275 great teachers of the East who defended the "dead lion" against the attacks and slights of the Karaites. A pupil of Saadiah who had undertaken the task, Jacob b. Samuel, would almost have been forgotten, if the Karaites who controverted him had not preserved his name. The contro- versy did not cease on account of a peace concluded by the parties, but from exhaustion. It is true, a small anti- Karaite pamphlet appeared at the beginning of the twelfth century in the East, probably in Egypt, but it does not touch at all upon points of the Law on which the Rabbanites and Karaites differ; in fact, it is no more than a literary curiosityl. In Europe, the controversy with the Karaites never assumed important dimensions. A great teacher of the West, Meshullam b. Kalonymos, combats the views of the Karaites towards the end of the tenth, or the beginning of the eleventh century, but we do not know the motives that called forth the controversy, nor does it seem that he has written a separate book against them 2. The scholars in Spain were contented, either with a defence of the Tradition only, without taking the offensive (Jehuda Hallevi), or they corroborated their truth from the never ceasing source of Tradition, and by the distin- guished achievements of its adherents (Abraham ben David), or they appealed to the secular power (Jehuda Ibn Ezra). But the Karaites themselves also seem to have lost vitality and productiveness, by the absence of a strenuous contro- versy against them. Not regarding a few sporadic followers, the independent creative power of the Karaites ceases with Jeshua b. Jehuda (Abulfara Furqan ibn 'Asad), who wrote some twenty years after Samuel b. Chofni. For the im- 1 Vid. JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, VIII, 700, 70I, where I communicated the epigraph and some lines from this little pamphlet.

Mose, lies really in his trans- lations, from which he is called "ha-ma'atiq." The brilliant period of Karaite literature ends with Jehuda Hadassi, but he was after all only a compiler, although his work, Eshkol Hakkofer, is invaluable to us, because it contains the results of the Karaite learning before him. The Karaite authors from the twelfth century, except, perhaps, the two Aarons, produced hardly anything new, especially in the field of the knowledge of the Law. They all depend on their predecessors, and "enrich themselves by their writings ." They all, even to their last teacher, Abraham Firkowitsch, draw inspiration from the repetition of the most virulent attacks against the Rabbanites in general, and the Fajjfimite, "that man there" (5j5 bint iI)2 in particular. But a litera- ture cannot live on chewing the cud of older opinions and on controversy, and nothing more, especially when these are not even fertilized by any new thoughts. Thus it is that the Karaite literature vanished silently. A new Saadiah would be required to rouse it to fresh life, but our age is not such as to produce one, nor has Judaism any interest i., calling forth new animosities.
