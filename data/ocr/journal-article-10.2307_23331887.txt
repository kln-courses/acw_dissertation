Todes Department of History of Science, Medicine and Technology The Johns Hopkins University 1900 E. Monument Street, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA ABSTRACT - The relationship between Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) and the Bolsheviks quick ly evolved into a combative collaboration. Although ideologically hostile to their revolution, Pavlov was nonetheless a world-renowned physiologist and institution-builder interested in the defense of his scientific empire and of Russian science as a whole. Although they consid ered Pavlov a political reactionary, the Bolsheviks were interested in building Soviet science and turning his international prestige to their advantage. In 1918-1921 Pavlov harshly criti cized the Communists and contemplated emigration, remaining in Russia only after gaining special privileges for himself and his labs. In the 1920s he was a 'prosperous dissident', pub licly objecting to state policies and methods while expanding his scientific empire through state patronage. In the 1930s Pavlov's prosperity grew, his relationship with individual Com munists (notably Nikolai Bukharin) matured, and his attitude shifted: while continuing to denounce Soviet policies, he also praised Soviet achievements. Pavlov's privileged status with in the new order empowered him to act on behalf of himself and others and to serve the broader interests of his science and his homeland as he understood them. Pavlov is entirely ours, and we will never surrender him to anybody. Nikolai Bukharin, 1936 In a sentimental and triumphant obituary, Nikolai Bukharin claimed Ivan Pavlov for the revolution. Pavlov was 'entirely ours', the Bolshevik leader wrote, by virtue of his philosophical materialism and his ultimate embrace, after 'doubts [and] vacillations', of the great his torical mission of the Communist Party.1 For the next fifty years Soviet historiography followed Bukharin's lead, telling the simple and exemplary tale of the great scientist who, true to his standards of objectivity, ultimately overcame his prejudices to recognize the success of the Soviet experiment. Acknowledging that Pavlov did not initially 'understand' the revolution, the standardized narrative notes his brief flirtation with the idea of emigration in 1920, but moves quickly to the lavish state support for Pavlov inaugurated by Lenin's decree of 1921, triumphantly concluding with Pavlov's warm praise for the Bol 1 Ν.

TODES sheviks at the International Congress of Physiologists (1935) and in his 'Testament to the Youth' (1936). The tendentiousness of this official narrative was well known to a number of Soviet scholars. Beginning in 1989, V.D. Esakov, V.O. Samoilov, and Iu. Vinogradov took advantage of glasnost to discuss previously suppressed material that turned the traditional Soviet tale on its head. Pavlov's impassioned criticisms of Bolshevik policies in the years 1920-1934 became the centerpiece of a new narrative reso nant with the democratic aspirations of Russia's intelligentsia during perestroika. The triumphant endpoint of the discarded Soviet version, Pavlov's praise for the Bolsheviks just before his death, was reduced to a puzzling and somewhat embarrassing anticlimax.2 In this article I use newly available archival material to understand the complex and evolving relationship between an authoritarian state and one of the world's most renowned scientists. I believe these materials demonstrate that the relationship between Pavlov and the Bolsheviks evolved into a combative collaboration driven by their differing interests, ideologies, and resources. This is a story, then, not just of a sustained moral and ideological encounter, but also of the complex interconnec tions between the builder of a scientific empire and its state patron. Political Views on the Eve of the Bolshevik Revolution In October 1917 Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849-1936) was a world renowned scientist whose political convictions had been shaped by sixty-eight years of life experiences - the scientism imbibed in his youth, the self-discipline and professional success achieved in his mid dle age, and the fierce but complex patriotism forged during the last decades of Imperial Russia. 2 Years before glasnost N.M. Gureeva and V.L. Merkulov made extensive use of sensitive archival mate rial in the second volume of their Letopis' zhizni i deiatel'nosti akademika I. P. Vavlova [Chronicle of the Life and Activity of Academician I. P. Pavlov], which detailed Pavlov's life after the Bolshevik revolution. That fine volume was never published; the manuscript presently resides among Merkulov's personal papers. In 1972 V. Esakov delivered a similarly well-researched lecture to the Pavlov Documentary Commission in Leningrad about Pavlov's negotiations with the Bolsheviks concerning emigration. He was able to publish this talk only in 1989 (see footnote 32). The present article makes much use of the numerous taped interviews that Iu. A. Vinogradov conducted with Pavlov's acquaintances and coworkers in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. As Vinogradov elicited reminiscences that did not fit the official historiography, these, too, were unpublish able. V.O. Samoilov studied archival materials for years but could use them freely only in 1989 (see footnotes 99, 105, 114). The writer Boris Volodin also gathered and studied a great deal of material about Pavlov and the Bolsheviks, but could publish searching essays only on Pavlov's pre-revolutionary years. So, when I began my own archival research in 1990, and was astonished by the exciting and seemingly fresh material that await ed me, I often discovered that these scholars had seen it years before. Their publications are cited where appropriate below. For a recent attempt to characterize Pavlov's political views, see N.A. Grigor'ian, 'Obshchestvenno-politicheskie vzgliady LP. Pavlova', Vestnik Akademii Nauk (1991), no. 10, 74-89.</page><page sequence="3">PAVLOV AND THE BOLSHEVIKS 381 While a seminarian in the 1860s Pavlov had become a fervent advo cate of the radical scientism propagated by Dmitrii Pisarev and other theoreticians of the day. Abandoning his family's longstanding clerical tradition, he enrolled in the science faculty at St. Petersburg Univer sity. His commitment to science proved enduring, but the radical sen timents associated with it quickly faded. During his university years student demonstrators destroyed the career of his adored mentor, the rightwing physiologist I. F. Tsion. This 'wild episode' (as he later ter med it) left him professionally adrift and alienated from the liberal intelligentsia. The last decades of Imperial Russia were good to Pavlov. In 1890 he became assistant professor at St. Petersburg's Military-Medical Acade my. One year later Prince Ol'denburgskii of the royal family appointed him director of the physiology section at the newly-founded Institute of Experimental Medicine. His research on digestive physiology in the 1890s brought him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1904). Three years later he was elected to Russia's elite Academy of Sciences, acquiring there his third laboratory. During these years he resided with his wife and four children in a spacious apartment, collected books and paintings, and spent summers at a dacha in Sillomiagi, Finland, where he swam, rode his bicycle, and socialized with other members of the cultural elite. Most important for Pavlov, however, was his scientific empire, over which he presided in firm patriarchal fashion, passionate ly pursuing his research on conditioned reflexes. Pavlov characterized himself as 'a Russian liberal',3 but his support for a gradual evolution to a constitutional monarchy put him some what to the right of the Constitutional Democrats (Kadets), the liber al party popular with his colleagues. With rare exceptions, he had nei ther the time nor inclination for political activities. Stung by Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese war (1904), he earned a black mark with the tsarist secret police during the Revolution of 1905 for his role in organizing an illegal union of professors.4 Shortly thereafter he seri ously considered running for the Duma as a candidate of the center right Octobrist Party, but nothing came of it.5 Soon disillusioned with politics, he again 'shut himself off in his scientific research'.6 31.

TODES The hallmarks of his political ideology were scientism and what one acquaintance termed 'state patriotism' - a personal identification with Russia's strength and international stature.7 Yet this 'state patriotism' coexisted with an uncomfortable conviction that, probably for histor ical reasons, the 'Russian type' was inferior to the English and the German. In 1916 he wrote: 'When the negative features of the Rus sian character - laziness, lack of enterprise, and even a slovenly approach to every vital work - provoke melancholy moods, I say to myself, No, these are not our real qualities, they are only the veneer, the damning inheritance of slavery'.8 World War I aroused Pavlov's patriotism. He devoted his first lec ture of the 1914-15 academic year to an enthusiastic endorsement of Russia's war aims and peppered his lectures with pained comments about the army's continual defeats.9 With two sons at the front, he followed the war news avidly and assured his coworkers that 'if not for my age I would abandon everything and volunteer for the army'.10 As defeat turned to debacle, he scorned Tsar Nicholas II as an 'idiot' and 'a degenerate'.11 His preoccupation with the war sep arated him from his liberal colleagues in the Kadet Party, whom he scolded on several occasions when they attempted to recruit him. 'Don't you understand that you are committing a crime,' his wife recalled him saying, 'arranging a revolution during wartime! This will lead to no good! No, I will never participate in the ruin of my homeland!'.12 The overthrow of the Tsar in February 1917 left Pavlov 'extremely pessimistic'.13 Yet, he declared his allegiance to the Provisional Gov ernment and warmed to its promise of expanded freedoms and sup port for science.14 Continued social dissolution and military defeats, however, soon confirmed his deepest fears. 7 G.

'He talked constantly about the death of our homeland', recalled one close friend, 'regarded the Bolsheviks with hostility and distrust, and openly expressed his dissatisfaction with their various measures'.15 These sentiments were shared by the great majority of his colleagues at the three institutions where he worked: the Academy of Sciences, the Military-Medical Academy, and the Institute of Experimental Medicine all passed resolutions in November 1917 denouncing 'the tyrants who have seized power'.16 Pavlov's initial hostility was fanned by growing anarchy and mater ial privation, by the Bolsheviks' 'mechanical, all-centralizing' science policy, by their granting of independence to parts of Imperial Russia's empire, and by their signing of what he considered a dishonorable separate peace agreement with Germany in March 1918. Addressing a deceased friend at graveside, Pavlov grieved for Russia as well: Ί envy you. You no longer witness ... the ever-increasing destruction and dis grace of our homeland'.17 The revolution soon made its mark on the Pavlov family itself. One son, Vsevolod, an officer at the front, informed his parents of the 'anarchistic hurricane' that was devouring the army, of the humiliation of officers, and of his intention to 'fulfill my citizenly duty to the Homeland'.18 He soon joined the White resistance. Another son, Vik tor, embarked on a mysterious journey to White territory that ended tragically when he contracted typhus and died in a hospital in Kiev.19 During the Red Terror of 1918-1920 the Bolshevik secret police (Cheka) searched the Pavlov home several times and briefly detained both Pavlov and his eldest son, Vladimir.20 Political arrests reached 15 M.

Luk'ianov.21 The Civil War between the Red and White armies (1918-1921) produced disastrous living conditions throughout the country, nowhere more dramatically than in 'hungry Petrograd'.22 The life of scientists there grew extremely grim. The Bolshevik government, its very survival hanging in the balance, wasted few resources on the wel fare of a scientific community that it considered, with good reason, to be politically hostile. From his spacious quarters at the Academy of Sciences s residence on the 7th Line of Vasilevskii Island, Pavlov wit nessed the disastrous state of affairs for Russia's scholarly elite. Two academicians living in his building died of cold and hunger; others watched helplessly as the Communist authorities housed strangers in their quarters.23 Pavlov himself scavenged for firewood and fed his family from a garden he tended at the Institute of Experimental Med icine. His Nobel Prize money was confiscated, as were the gold medals awarded to him by St. Petersburg University and the Acade my of Sciences. By 1918 his laboratory work was grinding to a halt, interrupting his research on conditioned reflexes at a crucial juncture. Assistants, dogs, and provisions for both were in short supply. He complained to one colleague that his laboratories could no longer produce results suit able for lecture demonstrations, let alone for publication; 'work has almost completely ceased', and the dark, cold Petrograd winter was approaching. 'There are no candles, no kerosene, and electricity is provided for only a limited number of hours. Bad, very bad. When will there be a turn for the better?'24 Pavlov shared his reactions to the Bolshevik revolution in a series of public lectures that same year. Entitled 'On the Mind in General', 'On the Russian Mind', and 'The Foundations of Culture of Animals and Man', these lectures drew upon his research on conditioned reflexes to interpret Russia's national tragedy in terms of weaknesses in the 'Russian type'. Their tone is evident from the introduction to his first lecture: 21 Luk'ianov was arrested in November 1919.

But if an entire people, with its main lower mass having only recently left a state of slavery, and with its intellectual strata having for the most part only borrowed foreign culture, and not always success fully at that, a people as a whole having given relatively litde of its own to gen eral culture and to science - if such a people imagines itself the leader of human ity and begins to supply other peoples with models of new cultural forms of life, then we have before us tragic, calamitous events that can threaten this people with the loss of its political independence.25 He attributed these 'tragic, calamitous events' - including the Febru ary and October revolutions, Trotsky's negotiating stance during peace talks with the Germans, and the dissolution of the Russian empire - to a fundamental weakness in 'the Russian mind'. Russians were unre alistic, Pavlov argued; they were prone to extreme generalizations, indifferent to facts, and undisciplined. A prime example was Bolshevism. While European social demo crats legitimately sought to protect industrial workers, their Russian counterparts pushed this to a grotesque and unrealistic extreme: We have overextended this idea into the dictatorship of theproletariat. We have placed the brain, the head, below and the feet above. That which con stitutes the culture, the intellectual strength of the nation, has been devalued, and that which for now remains a crude force, replaceable by a machine, has been moved to the forefront. All this, of course, is doomed to destruction as a blind rejection of reality.26 Drawing upon his laboratory experiments with dogs, Pavlov argued that appropriate responses to reality required a balance between 'exci tation, or freedom in the broad sense' and 'inhibition, or discipline, the bridle'.27 The English and Germans exemplified such balance, but Russians were always deficient in discipline. The results were espe cially dramatic 'in our revolutionary time'. This is a wonderful and terrible illustration. What is revolution in general? It is liberation from all the inhibitors about which I spoke. It is complete absence of restraint. There were laws, customs, and so forth. All of this has now come to nothing. The old is gone, the new still does not exist. Inhibition is eliminated, there remains only excitation. And this produces all sorts of excesses in the realms of desire, thought, and behavior. 25 I.

TODES The absence of inhibition was manifest throughout Russian life, from the rebellion of students and lab assistants against the authority of seasoned professors to the rebellion of the Empire's nationalities against the Russian state. What sense is there in this? Together we are strong, but iî we are separate those who are stronger will make short work of us. And so it is already. It is clear that our aspiration does not answer the demands of humankind and is the result of the removal of the bridle from us; this is the manifestation of liberty, of freedom, without any participation of the other half of life, of discipline, of inhibition.28 These public lectures reveal an anthropomorphic dimension to Pavlov's thought at odds with his carefully cultivated image as a quin tessential objectivist. Inhibition and excitation were emerging as cen tral concepts in Pavlov's vision of higher mental activity, and the metaphorical relationship between inhibition and discipline on the one hand, and excitation and freedom on the other, I think, played an important role both in his scientific research and in his evaluation of political circumstances.29 These speeches clearly express Pavlov's essential grievances with a revolution that he associated with disorder, the dissolution of Russian national power, a threat to the autonomy and very exis tence of Russian science, and the loss of his own social position and privileges. The Emigration Option In April 1918 Pavlov referred in the past tense to 'the very height of Bolshevik power', believing, like many others, that the Communists would shortly be ousted.30 Between October 1919 and Spring 1920, however, the tide of Russia's civil war turned decisively toward the Red Army.31 Faced with the prospect of spending the rest of his life under Bol shevik rule, Pavlov sent a pained letter in June 1920 to the Soviet of Peoples' Commissars (Sovnarkom) requesting permission to 'begin a correspondence (even a controlled one) with my foreign scientific 28 I.

He complained of 'insurmountable material diffi culties of every type in contemporary Russian laboratories and the absence of contact, of links with international scientific work.' Nor could he work productively when the salaries from his three academ ic positions were inadequate to support his family: I am compelled to work as a gardener in the appropriate season, which at my age is not always easy, and even to constantly play the role of a servant, of an assistant to my wife in the kitchen and maintenance of the apartment's cleanli ness, which, taken together, occupies a large, and even the best, part of the day. And despite this my wife and I eat very poorly, in both amount and quality; for years we have not seen white bread, for weeks and months at a time we have no milk or meat, feeding largely upon black bread of poor quality, on millet, also of poor quality, and so forth, which naturally is causing us gradually to waste away and lose our strength. And this after a half-century of intense scientific work crowned by valuable scientific results recognized by the entire scientific world.33 The psychological obstacles to productive research were also great. For one thing, he was 'profoundly convinced that the social experi ment being conducted on Russia is doomed to certain failure and that it will yield no result save the political and cultural death of my home land; this thought oppresses me relentlessly and prevents me from concentrating on my scientific work'.34 For another, he could not function as 'a serf, a slave of others'. He could not surrender to the state control over his work and its rewards: Ί want to have at my own complete disposal the fruits of my intellectual work, which ... in the form of scientific results will be useful to all people without being nationalized. I want to be able to create for myself certain comforts and satisfactions of life, to reward, to thank those who have helped me selflessly in the course of my life'.35 Pavlov's letter is clear, but his reason for writing it is not. Aided by his international network of friends and contacts, he could probably have emigrated even without the Bolsheviks' permission. He tacitly 32 Copy of letter from I. P. Pavlov to V. D.

TODES acknowledged this option in the first line of his letter: Ί have all my life preferred to act directly and openly'. He did indeed possess a deep sense of personal honor, and we cannot discount it as a factor in his behavior. There are, however, good reasons to view this letter as a means of opening negotiations and exploring his alternatives. Seventy years old, he did not relish the prospect of leaving Russia and beginning anew, especially since his opportunities abroad were uncertain. One week after writing to the Sovnarkom he explained to a colleague: I have not much longer to live. I have entered my eighth decade, but my brain still works properly and I very much want to more or less complete my work of many years on the large [cerebral] hemispheres. Remaining here, I will not achieve this goal. The obstacles - material, moral, and mental - are insurmount able. I hope to find abroad that which is necessary to me... I have there many friends and good comrades... I dare hope that [in expanded postwar institu tions] there will be found a place for me. It is difficult, terribly difficult, espe cially at my age, to leave my homeland, but what can I do? I do not have the strength to live here in current conditions.36 Pavlov's letter was routed to the Commissar of Public Enlighten ment, Α. V. Lunacharsky, who brought it quickly to Lenin's attention. Lunacharsky reminded Lenin that earlier 'we twice suggested that he go abroad'. Pavlov, he recalled, had responded that Ί wish to be loyal to Soviet power, although I condemn it for much. If I am asked while abroad I will have to speak the truth, and so prefer not to make any pledges of silence.' How, Lunacharsky asked, should he proceed?37 Lenin considered Pavlov's emigration impermissable and chose to regard the letter as a basis for negotiation. He informed G.E. Zi noviev, head of the Communist Party in Petrograd, that Pavlov want ed to leave 'in view of his difficult material situation', and that to allow him to do so would 'hardly be rational, since he expressed the thought that, being a truthful man, he will not, when appropriate dis cussions arise, fail to speak against Soviet Power and communism in Russia. Meanwhile, this scientist represents such a great cultural value that it is impossible to permit him to be forcibly restrained in Russia under conditions of material need'.38 Lenin suggested providing Pavlov a special food ration (paek), improving his living quarters, and rectifying conditions in his laboratories. Zinoviev passed Lenin's letter 36 Letter from I. P. Pavlov to V. K. Trofimov, cited in Trofimov's memoirs, ARAN 259.4.88. 37 Letter from Α. V. Lunacharskii to V. I.

D. Bonch Bruevich, whom he had met before the revolution at the home of a mutual friend. Briefly summarizing his first letter, he asked Bonch Bruevich to 'support my request'.40 Bonch-Bruevich conferred with Lenin, who only two days earlier had sent his directive to Zinoviev. How are we to understand Lenin's reaction to Pavlov's letters? Ear lier, if we are to believe Lunacharsky, the Bolshevik leadership had encouraged Pavlov to emigrate; now, in mid 1920, it considered him a national treasure. This new attitude may well have resulted from the same change in context that had elicited Pavlov's request itself: immi nent Red victory in the civil war. Indeed, as Pavlov was well aware, at this time the Academy of Sciences and other leading scientific institu tions were pressing upon the government the same arguments: failure to respect the autonomy of science and to provide emergency funding for scientists would result in mass emigration and the death of Rus sian science.41 A. P. Karpinsky, president of the Academy of Sciences, bluntly informed the Sovnarkom that, without a fundamental change in state policies, 'some Russian scholars will perish in Russia, victims of abnormal conditions, [and] others will follow the example of hun dreds of their comrades now working fruitfully for world science out side the borders of Russia. But such an event can scarcely be regard ed as normal and desirable'42. With Lenin's thoughts turning increas ingly to the building of Soviet society, then, the Pavlov affair high lighted the issues facing the Soviet scientific community as a whole, and his reaction to Pavlov's letters proved an important moment in Soviet science policy. For his part, Bonch-Bruevich followed Lenin's instructions.

TODES It is extremely painful for me to think that you, the pride and glory of Russian science, will abandon our homeland in order to complete one of your remarkable investigations... Do not doubt for one minute that the Soviet Government will do everything possible in order to provide you with absolutely everything that you wish so you do not feel in your life any want at all.43 Pavlov responded quickly, thanking Bonch-Bruevich for his sympa thetic comments, but insisting that his own privations were a sec ondary consideration. Describing the misery of those around him, he insisted: Now tell me yourself, in such circumstances, without losing self-respect, without self-reproach, can I agree to make use of fortuitous circumstances to acquire for myself support in everything that I want, in order to feel in my life no want at all (an expression in your letter)? Even were I free from nocturnal searches (there have been three at my home lately), were I not threatened by arrest. . . . Still, all the same, there would stand before my eyes, before my consciousness, the life of everyone close to me.44 While awaiting a response, Pavlov tested his negotiating leverage with another request: he asked the Commissar of Public Health, N. A. Semashko, to help him retrieve his confiscated gold medals. Semashko acted quickly, and the medals were returned in recognition of Pavlov's 'scientific services'.45 Appreciating the symbolism of this concession, Pavlov began in August 1920 to address various requests for his labora tories to the Petrograd City Soviet - all of which were quickly granted.46 In October 1920 Bonch-Bruevich finally responded to Pavlov's sec ond letter, again imploring him to remain in Russia and repeating the government's pledge of extensive support; should Pavlov 'insist' on emigrating, he should write an official request to the Commissariat of International Affairs.47 Convinced, apparently, that Bonch-Bruevich was stalling and that permission to emigrate was not forthcoming, Pavlov never replied. He informed a foreign visitor shortly afterwards that he had 'tried several times to get permission to leave the country but [it is] impossible'.48 43 ARAN 259.2.1112. 44 Copy of letter from I. P.

The Bolshevik leadership correctly detected here the long arm of Pavlov's international contacts.49 Expecting awkward publicity from émigré circles, Lenin carefully prepared his response to the Red Cross, and asked Semashko if he could reply confidently that Pavlov did not want to leave. This, Semashko responded, would be 'risky'.50 While preparing his reply, Lenin received a detailed report on con ditions in Pavlov's lab from E. Enchmen, an associate of Deputy Commissar of Enlightenment M. N. Pokrovskii. The creator of an idiosyncratic 'new biology' combining Marxism and Pavlovian physi ology, Enchmen had spent the last days of 1920 in Pavlov's lab at the Institute of Experimental Medicine. He reported 'the complete death of the enormous initiative of this singular scholar, despite the appar ently genuine desire of Comrade Zinoviev to implement Comrade Lenin's intentions'. The lab was 'completely closed and frozen', its staff had plummeted from twenty-five to two, and one hundred valu able laboratory dogs had died of poisoning after subsisting on refuse from a local artificial bread factory. The elderly 72-year-old toiler-enthusiast, Pavlov, in order to spend two hours in the lab with a luchina [long ember] in his hands (formerly he spent five hours, but the lack of light and absence of people makes a longer stay in the laborato ry useless) expends daily an astounding amount of energy and time (aside from cleaning potatoes at home) on the trip by foot from his home to the laboratory and back (the lines for the tram make it impossible for the old man to use it), that is, he covers a distance of twelve versts [about nine miles].51 Clearly, Enchmen concluded, the state must create a reliable adminis trative means of helping Pavlov. This accorded with Lenin's thinking. He consulted with Pokrovskii, Semashko, and others about both a reply to the Swedish Red Cross and a state decree to improve the conditions of Pavlov's life and work. The Red Cross was informed that Pavlov would not be allowed to 49 In a letter of 15 March 1921 Walter Cannon explained to A. I. Ringer that Pavlov's friend, Pro fessor Johansson, 'is closely associated with the Swedish Red Cross and has direct relations through mes sengers with Petrograd'. Cannon explained that the Swedish Red Cross would serve as a conduit through which money raised for Pavlov in the West would be sent to Petrograd (W. D.

TODES emigrate 'since the period of economic construction that Russia has entered requires the efforts of all the creative forces of the country'52. The culmination of these exchanges was an extraordinary decree of the Sovnarkom dated 24 January 1921. Entitled On Conditions Facil itating the Scientific Work of Academician I. P. Pavlov and His Coworkers', the decree assured Pavlov a privileged place in Soviet sci ence. It charged a special commission, including the famous writer Maxim Gorky and leading members of the Petrograd Soviet, with cre ating 'most propitious conditions' for Pavlov's scientific work. It also awarded Pavlov property rights to proceeds from domestic and inter national sales of a 'luxurious edition' of his works, assigned Pavlov's family a special paek equivalent to twice the normal academician's allotment, and decreed that his living quarters and central laboratory be furnished with 'all possible conveniences'.53 The day after this decree was issued the Commissariat of Enlight enment sent a letter to Pavlov introducing a certain 'comrade Aleinov' as his 'scholarly consultant'. Aleinov was empowered to take 'a whole series of measures' to facilitate Pavlov's work. The letter continued: We very much want you to remain within the RSFSR, to produce your work here, without prejudice either to you personally or to your activities. If, despite our measures, you should insist on moving abroad it would be desirable to reach agreement about a whole range of specifics. . . . I hope that, whatever the results of our discussions, you will in no case have rea son for any grudge against Soviet Power, which truly wishes to build you as com fortable a life as is conceivable in our country, which is undergoing such great trials, and for you to use your remarkable gifts to their full extent.54 Pavlov's wife, Serafima, summed up their understanding of the Bol shevik position: 'Give Ivan Petrovich [Pavlov] everything that he wants, but under no circumstances allow him to go abroad'.55 Lenin's proposed 'Pavlovian paek' was a peculiarly Soviet privilege, and Pavlov's reaction to it set the pattern for much that was to follow. Due to a severe food shortage in Russian cities, these special rations - 52 RTsKhIDNI 2.1.16813: 2. 53 This decree has been widely published, and is translated in B. P. Babkin, Pavlov, Chicago: Uni versity of Chicago Press, 1949: 165. 54 Letter from M. N. Pokrovskii to I. P. Pavlov, 25 January 1921, RTsKhIDNI 5.125: 24. 55 ARAN 259.1.170: 123. Here, obviously, the essence of the matter lay in the need to 'reach agree ment about an entire series of circumstances'. Based on their experience and, perhaps, oral communica tions, Pavlov and his wife clearly interpreted this phrase to involve unpalatable conditions regarding the fate of family members, family possessions, and a pledge of silence abroad. In her memoirs Serafima added that Pavlov was at the time aggressively courted by scientists in a number of countries, including the United States. This point is repeated so often in the memoir literature that its source is probably Pavlov himself. As discussed below, the archival evidence indicates that it is untrue.</page><page sequence="15">PAVLOV AND THE BOLSHEVIKS 393 available at special stores in exchange for coupons issued by the state - were extremely important to an individual's standard of living and to an institution's ability to attract and keep personnel. The contents of these food parcels differed according to the status of the recipient. They were an early manifestation of the manner in which blat (per sonal connections and influence) generated a system of privileges that separated selected individuals and groups from policies affecting the general population in Soviet Russia. Pavlov's 'special improved paek?' was sumptuous indeed. Its monthly contents included 70 pounds of wheat flour, 25 pounds of meat, 12 pounds of fresh fish, 3 pounds of black caviar, 10 pounds of beans, 4 pounds of cheese, 5 pounds of dried fruit, and 750 papirosy (thick cigarettes).56 Yet he initially refused to accept it, insisting that he and his wife 'find it unacceptable to be in a privileged position compared with our closest comrades'.57 The state understood Pavlov's position, correcdy, not as a rejection of privilege per se, but as a demand for broader assistance to scientists. In January 1921 Mitrofanov responded to the Kremlin's constant inquiries about local efforts on Pavlov's behalf: With respect to the personal life of Professor Pavlov we have succeeded in doing nothing, since he stubbornly refuses aid. He says that he cannot enjoy privileges not enjoyed by his colleagues. . . . Professor Pavlov's situation can be improved by providing the leading scholars of Petrograd with family rations; this will probably satisfy Pavlov.58 Petrograd's scientists were soon provided with paiki (though few were so bountiful as Pavlov's), and Pavlov gained the ability to acquire them for his coworkers. This not only eased his conscience, but also consolidated his control over his laboratories and became an added incentive to work there. Yet, at this very time, Pavlov began actively to explore his possibil ities in the West. The results were disappointing. His foreign col leagues - including Robert Tigerstedt in Helsinki, Ernest Starling and William Bayliss in London, and Walter Cannon, Simon Flexner, and Francis Benedict in the United States - could monitor his well-being through various branches of the Red Cross, collect money to ease his life in Russia, send meat from Helsinki to feed his dogs, and even, 56 Letter from RSFSR Pravlenie delami Kommissii po snabzheniiu rabochikh pri Narkomprode to the Secretariat of the Sovnarkom, 31 January 1921, GARF (Moscow) 130.5.633: 25. 57 Letter from I.

TODES perhaps, support him modestly in such relatively inexpensive locations as Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Helsinki.59 They did not, however, offer him an academic position, let alone one with the large-scale sup port and staff required for Pavlov's style of scientific work. British his torian Tilli Tansey has discovered one instructive attempt to do so. In February 1921 Ernest Starling, Professor of Physiology at University College, London, asked the Medical Research Council for funds to support Pavlov. The Council refused, citing doubts about the 72-year old Pavlov's physical and mental ability to carry on new investiga tions.60 In June 1921 it was Flexner's and Cannon's turn to receive a star tling communication from the Red Cross. Ernest Bicknell, acting director of foreign operations for the American Red Cross, relayed to them a telegram from the Red Cross representative in Russia. It said that Pavlov 'may soon receive permission to come out. Simon Flex ner anxious have Pavloff go America.' Bicknell asked Flexner to write a letter to the State Department in order to guarantee Pavlov a visa. Flexner assured a nonplussed Cannon that Ί have never had anything to do with urging Pawlow to come to America; indeed, quite the reverse'. He telegrammed Bicknell: 'Know nothing of proposal to have Pawlow come to America and unless his support assured, regard his coming as extremely hazardous'. Cannon agreed that for Pavlov to come to the US would be 'a disastrous blunder'.61 Why, then, did Pavlov remain in Russia? The following scenario seems most likely. Pavlov did not savor the prospect of leaving his homeland and beginning anew, but material privation, heartache at the situation in Russia, and the impossibility of continuing his scien tific work there forced him to consider emigration. Upon considera tion, however, it did not seem so appealing. Although the Bolsheviks could probably not have prevented a fully determined Pavlov from emigrating, a secret escape promised to be grueling at best for an ail ing old man with a family. And what awaited him in the West? Most likely, a modest retirement in a foreign culture, where he, a fiercely proud man, would be dependent on the charity of his colleagues and 59 W. D. Cannon papers, box 37, folder 459. In a letter of 28 April 1921 Pavlov asked Benedict to assess his opportunities in the West.

An obvious and presendy unanswerable question arises: who informed the Red Cross that 'Flexner anxious have Pavloff go America?'</page><page sequence="17">PAVLOV AND THE BOLSHEVIKS 395 unable to continue the scientific work at the very core of his exis tence. His prospects in revolutionary Russia were, by mid-1921, much brighter: stability was returning with the end of the civil war, and Lenin himself had made clear the state's interest in Pavlov's work and well-being. By mid-1921, the 'negotiations' between Pavlov and the Bolsheviks had essentially defined the boundaries of their relationship. The Bol sheviks would not permit Pavlov to emigrate, but they would extend special privileges to him and his laboratories. For his part, Pavlov could count on foreign support, but only in Russia could he acquire the resources necessary to pursue his investigations on a grand scale. There he would be allowed to maintain control over his laboratories, including his patriarchal relationship to his staff. This understanding, moreover, had emerged while Pavlov criticized the Bolsheviks round ly and insisted that doing so was a matter of personal honor. Prosperous Dissident (1921-1929) Throughout the 1920s Pavlov proved a vocal and uncompromising critic of the Bolsheviks. Protected by his special status, he attacked state policies in public forums where other dissident voices had long since been silenced. His reputation extended well beyond St. Peters burg, where his public appearances were packed by audiences expect ing political fireworks, to the outer reaches of the Soviet Union, where exiles and simple folk with a grievance wrote to him in expectation of a sympathetic ear. Yet, the same special status that enabled Pavlov to openly criticize Soviet power inevitably led to nuanced working relations with its rep resentatives. To manage a scientific empire, and to exploit his privi leges for the benefit of himself and others, he had to develop busi ness-like relations with the Communist Party. So, by the end of the 1920s, while he was consistently hostile in his comments about the Bolsheviks in general, Pavlov had developed a smooth working rela tionship with the state apparatus and with two important Commu nists, Lev Fedorov and Nikolai Bukharin. State largesse restored Pavlov's laboratories to life in the second half of 1921. By 1924, recalled one coworker at the Institute for Experimental Medicine, 'the laboratory came to acquire an especially comfortable, clean, and attractive appearance'.62 The renovated and 62 Rita Rait-Kovaleva, 'Vospominaniia ob akademike I.

TODES re-equipped laboratories were staffed by a new, much-expanded staff that provided the numerous 'skilled hands' indispensable to Pavlov's laboratory enterprise. Pavlov abandoned one of his three laboratories when he resigned from the Military-Medical Academy in 1924, in part, apparently, to protest its purge of students from clerical families. This loss, however, was more than compensated by the expansion of his two other laboratories at the Institute of Experimental Medicine and the Academy of Sciences. He also enjoyed access to a special hard-currency account (which he used to purchase foreign equip ment), the routine approval of various requests for special funding by the Sovnarkom and the Leningrad Soviet, the opportunity to travel abroad (for instance, to the United States in 1923 and 1929), and the ability to dispatch his coworkers abroad to study foreign techniques and spread the gospel of conditioned reflexes. Other forms of state cooperation raised Pavlov's status well beyond that of pre-revolutionary years. For example, in 1921 one of his coworkers, G. P. Zelenyi - exhibiting an intellectual independence not entirely to Pavlov's liking - requested state funding to create his own institute for the study of animal behavior. This proposal was forward ed to Pavlov, whose critical comments proved fatal.63 When Zelenyi informed the Commissariat of Public Health that Pavlov was too old to run his laboratories and should retire, that letter was forwarded to Pavlov as well.64 Impassioned Critic In pre-revolutionary times Pavlov traditionally devoted his first lec ture of the academic year to a subject of general interest - Turgenev, for example, or the World War. After 1917 he devoted them exclu sively to the horrors of Bolshevism.65 For example, in September 1923 he treated a standing-room-only crowd at the Military-Medical Academy to an extended emotional cri tique of Nikolai Bukharin's brochure, Proletarian Revolution and Cul ture (1923).66 The 'darling of the Party' (in Lenin's words), Bukharin « GARF (Moscow) 482.25.183. 64 G.

First, addressing his audience as a traditional patriot, he accused the Bolsheviks of aban doning Russia's national interests in their pursuit of the chimera of world revolution: Gentlemen, perhaps you have been remade into internationalists, but I was, am, and will remain a Russian, a son of my homeland. I am most of all interested in its life, I live by its interests, its dignity fortifies my own. I was not a little sur prised when very significant [events] in Russian history placed before me the question 'Will my homeland be or not be?', when I feared for the fate of my homeland. ... I speak truthfully when I say that the very thought that my home land will perish would deprive me completely of the basic sense of my scientific activity. For whom, then, would I strive? These are my true feelings. It will now be understandable why I live with two thoughts. On the one hand, with thoughts about physiology, and on the other - what will become of my homeland, what awaits my homeland, to what end is all this leading?68 Ί have just made a great journey,' he reminded his audience, 'and I saw nothing that would indicate the possibility of a world revolu tion'.69 His second main theme was that Bolshevik policies threatened to destroy Russian science. He excoriated Bukharin's argument that the Party would abolish the 'anarchy of cultural-intellectual production' by using the same planning principles employed to produce textiles and sausage. In recent decades we have [produced] not only outstanding representatives of science, but a generation of scholarly people. And what if this very science is slighted by people who themselves admit that they know nothing of this science! What will come of this? Is this not an extraordinary danger to science? And signs of this are already before us. Look how facilely those now in power address science! Fifteen of the most talented professors, representatives of science, were thrown out of Odessa University. Tell me, is this really possible? And now I have heard from one scholar who attended the congress of pathologists that virtually Kvartira-Muzei I.P. Pavlova in St. Petersburg.

That is, a rather large, venerable unit of scientific Russia, Odessa University, is being abolished. What sense is there in this? And there is information from Saratov University that it is completely closed. What is this? On the one hand, they want to eliminate the anarchy of this cultural-intellectual production. And they eliminate this anarchy by eliminating all the universities. To what will this lead when they examine all the sciences [to determine] what is worthwhile and what is not?70 These same inexperienced hands were reaching clumsily into the very heart of the scholarly system, 'remaking everything, constantly revising programs, abolishing an order recognized by the entire world, elimi nating doctoral degrees'.71 The Central Committee acquired a transcript of Pavlov's remarks, and three of its leading members soon responded. Zinoviev and Trot sky both targetted Pavlov in addresses to meetings of scientific per sonnel.72 (Trotsky complemented his public polemic with a respectful letter to Pavlov suggesting that he bring the insights of Freud's psy choanalytic theory within the more rigorous perspective of condi tioned reflexes.73) Bukharin's reply, On World Revolution, Our Coun try, Culture, and So Forth (A Reply to Professor I. Pavlov), appeared in early 1924 and was pointedly republished in the Military-Medical Academy's Party journal.74 Pavlov soon became a national symbol of political resistance. One widespread rumor - no doubt encouraged by his protests against the persecution of religion - held (falsely) that he was himself a religious believer. His personal archive contains many letters and entreaties from those encouraged by his reputation. For example, in 1925 the exiled 'Luke, bishop of Tashkent and Turkestan' warmly congratulat ed Pavlov on his 75th birthday and apologized for his tardiness in doing so. 'Banished for Christ to the very ends of the earth', he had just learned of Pavlov's jubilee.

The latter was especially threatening to Pavlov, since candidates for the doctoral degree in medicine provided the basic work force for his laboratory enterprise.

For the first time in the history of our Academy, so far as I know, the State is making declarations before the elections about the desirability of specific candidates. All the organs of the State (the press, the current leadership of institutions of higher learning, and social institutions) insist threateningly upon its wishes. It seems to me that this undermines the digni ty of the Academy and will weigh heavily upon academicians. It would be more just for the State itself direcdy to appoint to the Academy those people who are best from its point of view. And how the present manner of acting affects people! I will offer an example that took place 3-4 years ago. The then-president of the Execu tive Committee of the City Soviet [Ispolkom], Zinoviev, coerced those working in education with this procedure: 'The resolution is proposed. Who is against? Silence. The resolution is adopted unanimously'. About this time I met one of my comrade-professors and expressed to him my indignation at this. I must add that this comrade had a reputation as an especially honorable person. His reply was the following: 'What do you want? Don't you know that now any objection is suicide?' One cannot but acknowledge that our current situation carries with it great responsibility.78 Pavlov's intransigence frequently upset S. F. Ol'denburg, executive secretary of the Academy of Sciences, who thought that the Academy could save itself only by bowing to Communist Party demands. Dur ing one particularly heated meeting he and other academicians clashed with Pavlov over tactics. When V. I.

His objection to Communist policies was no less sincere for all his privileges, but these privileges set him apart from his colleagues and inevitably reduced his moral authority among them. In December 1929 Pavlov turned a celebration of the 100th an niversary of I. M. Sechenov's birth into a startling political spectacle. Asked to introduce the program with a few words, he strode dramat ically toward a large portrait of the 'father of Russian physiology' and addressed it: Oh noble and stern apparition! How you would have suffered if in living human form you still remained among us! We live under the rule of the cruel principle that the state and authority is everything, that the person, the citizen is nothing. Life, freedom, dignity, convictions, beliefs, habits, the possibility of studying, means for life, food, housing, clothing - everything is in the hands of the gov ernment... Naturally, gentlemen, the entire citizenry is transformed into a quiv ering, slavish mass... On such a basis, gendemen, not only can no civilized state be built, but no state at all can long survive.80 These were rare words indeed for a public gathering in 1929, and their effect was 'stunning'. Pavlov further disoriented his audience by proceeding without pause from his anti-Communist polemic to a request that all rise in Sechenov's honor. To stand or not to stand? As one member of the audience, Natalia Traugott, recalled sixty years later, 'Everybody was terribly afraid to stand, but at the same time one had to stand.'81 Everybody rose, looking around nervously; many Communists then walked out demonstratively. 79 Ε.

The characteriza tion of Pavlov as the 'ideological leader' of the Bolsheviks was a reference to the view of many Commu nist thinkers that his work on conditioned reflexes supported the dialectical materialist philosophy. Need less to say, this was not Pavlov's view. 80 ARAN 259.1.108:6. This section of the speech was edited out of the version published in Neop ublikovannye i maloizvestnye materialy I. P.

Some were former members of the White Army, who found there protection and a milieu in which they could comfortably express their opinions (and even swap anti-Soviet jokes). Communists and student militants frequently complained that the coworkers closest to Pavlov systemati cally hindered their attempts to build cooperative relations with the famous physiologist. By the end of the 1920s Pavlov's coworkers also included about ten Communist Party members. The Party cells at the Academy of Sci ences and the Institute of Experimental Medicine were still quite weak and, judging from the extant protocols of their meetings, they were more interested in currying Pavlov's favor than in challenging his political ideology and behavior: he was much too important a figure for rank-and-file Communists to confront. These Party cells did, how ever, represent a foreign source of authority in his labs. Pavlov frequently scolded these 'Communist gentlemen' about poli tics, but he generally held to his principle of judging assistants only by their scientific work. On one occasion in the early 1920s, he reportedly insisted that one coworker, P. K. Anokhin, leave either the Communist Party or his laboratory.82 Pavlov expressed high regard, however, for at least two Communist assistants, E. A. Asratian and L. N. Fedorov. Pavlov's relationship with Fedorov exemplifies the practical, coop erative relations that he formed with some Party members. A gradu ate of the Tomsk University medical school specializing in physiology and nervous diseases, Fedorov taught experimental psychology there beginning in 1921, and became Political Commissar of the university in July 1923.83 Shortly thereafter, the Sovnarkom transferred him to Pavlov's lab at the Institute of Experimental Medicine, where he became the Institute's first Communist Party member. He rose quick ly from lab assistant to senior scientific coworker (working simultane ously as the deputy director of Leningrad's department of public health).84 82 Anokhin apparently left the Communist Party, but I have been unable to find the relevant archival documents. 83 According to Fedorov's autobiographical statement for the Communist Party, he 'took an active part' in the Bolshevik Revolution and became President of the Communist Party's Executive Commission in his division at the front. According to a denunciation of Fedorov in 1935, however, he served under Kolchak in the White Army in 1920. This is from Fedorov's dossier in RTsKhlDNI (St. Petersburg branch), fond 1728, delo 308501: 1-3. 84 RTsKhlDNI (St. Petersburg) 1728.308501.</page><page sequence="24">402 DANIEL P. TODES Genuinely interested in his scientific research, Fedorov asked in 1925 to be relieved of some Party responsibilities in order better to pursue it. Ί am the only Party member working in Pavlov's laborato ry in the field of conditioned reflexes', he argued, 'which has an enor mous future from a Marxist point of view.'85 Pavlov supported this request with a letter lauding Fedorov's scientific promise. One clearly sees in him a real scientific worker. Aside from his scrupulous con scientiousness in work, he is observant, keenly following the often fleeting and barely perceptible physiological phenomena that pass before him; he is thought ful, pausing to evaluate every particularity of the experiment, and is full of a fer vent interest in the process of investigation... Unfortunately, working only by fits and starts, without concentration of one's powers and attention, cannot be espe cially fruitful. It would be advantageous for science if L.N. Fedorov could devote himself fully to his laboratory affairs.86 The Communist Party, however, had bigger plans for Fedorov, and Pavlov contributed to their success. In 1927 Pavlov proposed that Fedorov be appointed assistant director of the Institute of Experi mental Medicine. He was, Pavlov recognized, an important asset to the institute and his own lab there as 'a person with great administra tive experience, and one who is respected in those Moscow and Leningrad departments upon which various institute affairs depend.'87 Pavlov apparently expressed no objection when, in 1931, Fedorov became the institute's first Communist Director.88 In the 1930s Fedorov rose to national prominence, planning with Stalin and Gorky the founding of the Ail-Union Institute of Experimental Medicine in Moscow, serving as its director, and playing a central political and organizational role in the XVth International Congress of Physiolo gists of 1935. Pavlov knew, of course, that Fedorov was a well-connected Com munist who was monitoring his activities for the Party. Yet, by all accounts, his attitude toward him was respectful and even friendly. Decades after Pavlov's death, his family still remembered Fedorov warmly as a benefactor and protector.89 85 Letter from L. N.

For the state, the wisdom of its policy was confirmed by the cessation of Pavlov's public criticisms, by his public praise of the Soviet government's foreign policy and its sup port for science, and by his decisive role in the achievement of a pro paganda coup: the convening of the XVth International Congress of Physiologists in the USSR (1935). For Pavlov, the 1930s were years of unparalleled privilege and pros perity. The extent to which he was indulged by the Communist Party can be appreciated through several episodes. When Pavlov com plained that traffic outside the Institute of Experimental Medicine was disturbing his dogs, the offending street was moved. When he fell ill and a physician prescribed foreign champagne, this was imported the next day by train from Helsinki. When he required more space for his Physiological Institute at the Academy of Sciences, the president of the Academy of Sciences was ousted from his neighboring quarters. The USSR's most famous scientist was served by a chauffered Lincoln (although he usually preferred to walk), and his pantry was regularly supplied with imported food. The state also financed a massive new research center, the Insti tute of Experimental Genetics of Higher Nervous Activity, in the town of Koltushi, outside of Leningrad. A government decree of 1929 celebrated Pavlov's 80th birthday with massive funding for this new facility; a decree of 1934 marked his 85th with even more lav ish support. This largesse transformed a holding area for lab animals into a science village supplied by its own collective farm, one that came to serve as a second home for an ageing scientist with a taste for the countryside. The Koltushi complex addressed a variety of subjects, but at its core was a highly practical goal. As Pavlov explained in several inter views with the Soviet press, 'Our work will result in the success of eugenics - the science of the development of an improved human type.'90 In 1932, impatient at the slow pace of Koltushi's construction, he reiterated this goal in a letter to the head of the Sovnarkom, V. M. Molotov: 90 From an interview with Pavlov in 'Novaia Biologicheskaia Stantsiia akad. I. P. Pavlova', Izvestiia, 11 August 1933.</page><page sequence="26">404 DANIEL P. TODES I have assigned to this laboratory one exceptionally important task: based on my method of the investigation of higher nervous activity ... to determine by exper iments upon animals the conditions necessary to acquire, by means of selection by breeders, the most perfected nervous system (the experimental genetics of higher nervous activity). In order to move toward the successful study of this problem, the laboratory must be constructed with my personal participation. And I have the greatest desire, to the extent that my strength permits, to place this matter on a firm and fruitful basis for the use and glory, most of all, of my homeland.91 Molotov responded by designating construction at Koltushi a top-pri ority 'shock brigade' project, and a press campaign warned that Sovi et society would not permit its progress to be slowed by 'sabotage'.92 Remarkably, this occurred at a time when eugenics was under consid erable political attack (the Russian Eugenics Society was suppressed in 1930).93 Pavlov's special status exempted him from purges, plans, and other Party policies that radically reduced the autonomy of other scientists in the 1930s. For example, when asked for the detailed work plans required of all Soviet scientists and institutions in 1932, Pavlov responded that, aside from following their investigation of higher ner vous activity wherever it led, he and his coworkers 'are working with out a plan'.94 Then, in 1933, a professor from the Section of Scientif ic Workers arrived at Pavlov's lab at the Academy of Sciences to inform him of plans to purge 'anti-Soviet elements' there. Pavlov lit erally chased him out of the laboratory, screaming 'Get out, scum!' After a militant meeting, the Section dispatched a delegation to S. M. Kirov, head of the Communist Party in Leningrad, only to be told, Ί cannot help you'.95 In the years 1929-1936 Pavlov's opinion of and relationship with the Bolsheviks changed gradually - and, by 1934-1936, qualitatively. Having regarded the Soviet state throughout the 1920s as a terrorist regime, by 1934 he regarded it as his country's government, with a mixed record of crimes, blunders, and important achievements. This was accompanied by a more fundamental attitudinal shift: he had become an insider, criticizing state policies only in private or semi-pri vate forums, and attempting to right wrongs by using his connections. 91 Letter from I. P. Pavlov to the Sovnarkom, 2 August 1932, GARF (Moscow) 5446.13.2012: 12-13. 92 See, for example, 'Koltushi', Krasnaia gazeta, 3 October 1933. 93 See M. Adams, 'Eugenics in Russia, 1900-1940'. In M.

ARAN 259.la.46: 9-10.</page><page sequence="27">PAVLOV AND THE BOLSHEVIKS 405 As with Pavlov's earlier decision not to emigrate from revolutionary Russia, his altered relationship to the Bolsheviks in the 1930s resulted from a number of factors. The ideological and political elements in his transformation are relatively easy to document. As we shall see below, the same fundamental elements of Pavlov's pre-revolutionary world view that had set him against the Bolsheviks in the 1920s - his scien tism and 'state patriotism' - militated in the 1930s toward a rap prochement with the Soviet state. Pavlov's many personal and profes sional privileges - including his ability to act effectively through the state apparatus - also could not fail to influence him. Pavlov's transformation also seems to have been facilitated by two specific events of 1928-1929: his son's return from exile, and the Bol shevization of the Academy of Sciences. In 1928 the state permitted Pavlov's younger son, Vsevolod, a former officer in the White Army, to return to Russia. The attached conditions, if any, are unknown; but we do know that the Pavlov family worried constantly in subsequent years about Vsevolod's vulnerability to political arrest.96 Concern about his family's well-being did not prevent Pavlov from criticizing the Bolsheviks, but no doubt it exercised an influence, especially when, in the mid-1930s, he began to consider what might happen after his death. The Bolshevization of the Academy in 1928-1929 was also, I think, an important psychological turning point. This process, which brought the central symbol of Imperial Russian science under Com munist control, also strained Pavlov's relations with other academi cians. Shortly after the Academy elections, Pavlov briefly reconsidered emigration, and also made his first, subtle, conciliatory step toward the state.97 Both reactions, perhaps, reflected a new level of recogni tion that Soviet power was an unchangeable fact - a fact that Pavlov dealt with most successfully, not in union with his peers, and not as a public critic, but as an individual with influence and connections within the established order. 96 Author's interview with Ludmila Vladimirovna Balmasova, 27 June 1991. 97 A report to the Central Committee in 21 May 1929 mentioned 'rumors' that Pavlov and the clos est members of his family might not return from their scheduled trip that year to the International Con gress of Physiologists in the United States. The Communist Party insured itself against this possibility by allowing only Pavlov's son Vladimir to travel with him. Two months later, commenting on a letter from Pavlov regarding the Soviet delegation to that same Congress, one member of the Central Committee, E. Voronov, noted that 'In the history of our relations with Pavlov he is addressing us for the first time with a request. Previously ... he spoiled us, not so much by his 'fervent appeals', as by his heated scolding. This request should be evaluated as an open step, taken at his own initiative, toward rapprochement. To spurn him, of course, would be incorrect!' Both of these letters are in GARF 8429.5.15. My thanks to Natalia Ismailova for discovering them and making them available to me.</page><page sequence="28">406 DANIEL P. TODES Like any individual, however, he was subject to the influence of his circle. By the 1930s this included Communists, 'non-Communist Bol sheviks', and anti-Communists - all with their own interests and, as the quiet terror mounted, their own fears. Furthermore, a decade of businesslike dealings with the Communist Party had normalized Pavlov's relations with such leading Communists as Fedorov, Kamin skii, and, most importantly, Bukharin. When events compelled Pavlov to make decisions about complicated political affairs, all three were quite willing to offer advice. Finally, Pavlov and his circle were under constant surveillance by the secret police, whose information at times proved useful in pro ducing a Pavlov who, in appearance at least, was 'entirely ours'. Pavlov and Bukharin Nikolai Bukharin was the Communist leadership's leading practi tioner of detente with the 'bourgeois intelligentsia' because, as Sheila Fitzpatrick puts it, he best communicated an involvement 'in the spir itual and psychological problems that members of the old intelli gentsia discussed among themselves'.98 Perhaps for that reason, Bukharin was instructed to approach Pavlov during the struggles at the Academy of Sciences in autumn 1928." This leading Communist believed that Pavlov's worldview pro vided ample common ground for a conciliatory approach. As he explained in 1929, when a member of Stalin's faction in the Central Committee attacked Pavlov as an ardent reactionary: Ί know that he does not sing "The Internationale "...but he is the world's leading physiologist, a materialist, and, despite all his grumbling, ideologically he is working for us.'100 The only known accounts of their first encounter are second-hand reports originating with Bukharin. According to these, Bukharin over came Pavlov's initially frosty reception by impressing the physiologist with his erudition. He spoke of ancient philosophy, Kant, Hegel; that is, about 'subjects demonstrating to him my education, and about 98 Sheila Fitzpatrick, The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia, Ithaca: Cornel] University Press, 1992: 61. Robert Conquest points out that when Stalin broke with Bukharin in the late 1920s, Stalin attacked Bukharin's line on peaceful cooperation with non-Communist specialists. See Robert Conquest, Stalin, New York: Viking, 1991: 152. 99 Many years later, Bukharin's widow recalled that Lenin had suggested that a personal approach to Pavlov might bear fruit. V. O.

Emphasis is in Bukharin's letter.</page><page sequence="29">PAVLOV AND THE BOLSHEVIKS 407 which he was in a position to judge on the basis of his own educa tion'. It was butterflies that finally did the trick. As a youth Bukharin had won a wager by memorizing the Latin names of 300 butterflies. He now regaled Pavlov (himself an avid collector) with a complete recitation. Only then did Ivan Petrovich [Pavlov], it seems, first look at me with interest.' When this performance was over, Pavlov stated frankly that he had opposed Bukharin's election to the Academy of Sciences. With this, 'the ice was broken'.101 In late October 1928, Pavlov openly expressed his respect for Bukharin and invited him home for tea - this despite his indignation at the election of Communist 'terrorists' to the Academy, one of whom was Bukharin himself.102 Shortly thereafter Pavlov reportedly accepted an invitation to Bukharin's home in the Kremlin, where he was further impressed by his host's interest in biology (Bukharin kept there an ornithological collection and a pet fox).103 Pavlov identified Bukharin with his hope for the moderation of Bol shevik policies, and spoke of him frequently with high regard. This was an 'intelligent Communist', learned and humane - but an unrealistic dream er. 'I'd like to have him in our dog stand for a few years', Pavlov remarked to one coworker. 'We would teach him to correctly reflect actual reality.'104 Their relationship flowered in the 1930s, by which time Bukharin's political power was rapidly waning under Stalin's attack. Bukharin re mained, however, an important figure as head of the science and re search sector of the USSR's Supreme Economic Council and as editor of Izvestiia, which published many interviews with Pavlov in these years. As Samoilov and Mozzhukin astutely observe, Izvestiia corre spondents conducted these interviews with great subtlety and tact. By framing their questions carefully and avoiding contentious subjects, they were able to publish accurate transcripts of Pavlov's responses free of comments manifesting 'disloyalty to the government'.105 101 This is from the accounts of conversations with Bukharin, in: Boris Nicolaevsky, Power and the Soviet Elite, Janet Zagoria (ed.), New York: Frederick Praeger, 1965: 14-16; and Kamil Ikramov, Delo moego otsa, Moscow: Sovetskii Pisatel', 1991: 163-164. The latter report is actually third-hand, related from Bukharin to I. A. Kassirskii to Ikramov. The stories, however, are totally consistent, differing only in emphasis and detail (in his conversation with Nicolaevsky, Bukharin apparendy portrayed this encounter as the beginning of a sincere relationship; in his narrative to Kassirskii he emphasized his skill ful tactics in overcoming Pavlov's reticence). 102 The reference to 'terrorists' is from Iu. A. Vinogradov's interview of 13 June 1969 with a Com munist Party member, Korotin, who encountered Pavlov at this time (ARAN razriad XVI). E. G.

TODES Bukharin may have indeed, as he later claimed, 'fallen in love' with Pavlov, but he also strove constantly to charm him into political cooperation.106 In 1931, for example, he playfully tried to dissuade Pavlov from including the original introduction, with its criticism of revolutionary change, in a new edition of his Lectures on Conditioned Reflexes. Dear Iv. Petrovich [Pavlov], don't do this by all that's holy!... Why do you want to create all kinds of friction? What for? They are prepared to take care of you in every way, all are prepared to welcome your every work, but you want des perately to stick a feather up the revolution's ass. Don't do this, for god's sake! Don't be angry with me for this intervention. We agreed about sincerity. So allow me to address you with this fervent request. Don't quarrel with the revo lution.107 Pavlov responded: Whether it's in my blood, or from a 60-year habit in the laboratory, I would be ashamed of myself were I to be silent when it is necessary to speak, or if I did not say what I think. Therefore I cannot agree to remove from the old introduc tion the part about revolutions. For me revolution is truly something terrible for its cruelty and violence, violence even against science; you know, your dialectical materialism, as it is currently formulated in [our] life, is not a hair different from the teleology and cosmogony of the Inquisition... I am not a reactionary, as your people call me; on the contrary, for me, neither in life nor in science is anything final; rather, there are infinite changes and addi tions. Only I am not a destroyer but... a gradualist.108 He added a plaintive postscript: 'Why is it that I understand you, but you do not understand me?'. 'If anything happens', Pavlov confided to a coworker in 1934, Ί can turn to Bukharin'109 He did so on several occasions in order to save arrested coworkers and acquaintances. When the secret police arrested Serafima's niece for no apparent reason, Pavlov asked Bukharin to 'help, if you can', adding: 'My God, how hard it is now for any honorable person to live in Your Socialist Paradise.'110 In the mid-1930s Pavlov reportedly agreed to support Bukharin's plan to found a second political party, composed of intellectuals, to 106 In his obituary to Pavlov, Bukharin (footnote 1) wrote: Ί fell in love with this person and he responded mutually'. 107 Undated letter from Ν.

His continued, passionate rejection of basic state policies is evident from his 1934 correspondence. In a letter to the Commissar of Public Health, G. N. Kaminskii, he wrote: Unfortunately, I have almost the complete opposite feeling about our revolution as do you. For you, enthused by several of its truly enormous positive achievements, it 'inspires good cheer at the wondrous forward movement of our homeland'; but for me, on the contrary, it is very often alarming, filling me with doubts. Do you see clearly... its enormous, truly negative sides! Do you think sufficient ly about the fact that many years of terror and the unrestrained arbitrariness of power is transforming our already Asiatic nature into a shamefully slavish one? I have seen, and I see constandy, many extraordinary examples of this. Can one construct much good with slaves? Pyramids, yes; but not universal, true human happiness.113 In a letter to Molotov the same year, Pavlov denounced the Soviet state's 'unrelenting regime of terror and violence', its persecution of religion, and its mystical faith in Marxism-Leninism.114 Also in 1934, Pavlov wrote to a colleague that the Soviet state had not met its most basic obligations to the people, as was clear from 'last year's famine, which reached the point of cannibalism and a terrible nation-wide typhus [epidemic]; and the present mass malnutrition, the absence of sufficient fuel, crowding and filth, a shortage of the most common medicines, etc. etc.'115 During his weekly meetings with coworkers he 111 Β.

TODES berated the Communists among them about the country's poor hous ing and medical care, and about the Communist Party's blind venera tion of Stalin.116 Pavlov used his influence to free a number of people caught in the accelerating wave of political arrests. The beneficiaries ranged in sta tus from professors D. N. Prianishnikov and A. A. Vladimirov to A. I. Barkhatova, the woman who cleaned Pavlov's dog kennels. Barkha tova was released when Pavlov insisted that her services were essential to showcasing his laboratories at the upcoming International Congress of Physiologists.117 His frequent insulting remarks about Communist policies, and his insistence upon control over his scientific enterprise, led to several con frontations with the Communist Party cells in his laboratories. For example, in 1932, under new regulations at the Academy of Sciences, two Communist graduate students were assigned to work in Pavlov's lab without having received his permission. They reported to their Party cell that he greeted them with a torrent of abuse ('You Commu nists have destroyed everything'). He concluded his tirade as follows: You are antipathetic to me; I break every connection to you, I wilJ not supervise your work; but since the laboratory and its equipment do not belong to me, you can walk about in the laboratory. . . . But I declare to you that I will take anoth er look and see if this is convenient for me; and if this disturbs me in any way - and where there is no harmony I cannot think - then I can at any moment pose the question: I or they? And here I have some chances.118 Emboldened by these words, Pavlov's lab manager, N. A. Pod kopaev, also refused to supervise their work. The Party cell labelled Pavlov's behavior 'a clear class attack by a political enemy of Soviet society and the Party'. Noting that he also conducted 'open counter revolutionary propaganda at his seminars,' the cell urged re-evalua tion of 'the line toward Pavlov'.119 Such decisions, however, were made at the highest level of the Party, and were based upon far weightier considerations. 116 These remarks, of course, like much other material that did not suit the current Soviet image of Pavlov, were edited out of versions of these sessions published in 1948 and 1949. 117 Pavlov's letter of 20 August 1930 to the Soviet of Peoples' Commissars on behalf of Prianishnikov and Vladimirov is in ARAN 259.la.19. His letter on behalf of the worker A. I. Barkhatova, dated 27 May 1935, is in ARAN 135.1 (1935).6. My thanks to Iu. A. Vinogradov, who discovered this letter, for bring ing it to my attention. Pavlov also arranged the release from prison of several of his coworkers. One, V.P. Adlerberg-Zotova, was arrested and exiled sometime before the XVth International Congress of Physiol ogists (1935). At the Congress Pavlov prevailed upon Molotov to have her released - and she and her family soon returned to Leningrad. This from a 1982 interview conducted by Iu. A.

The letter to Kaminskii cited above acknowledged the Communist state's 'truly enormous positive achievements'. Especially impressive, in Pavlov's view, was the support for and prestige of science in the USSR. One coworker later recalled hearing his first positive comment about the Bolsheviks during a visit to Koltushi in 1929: 'You must give our barbarians one thing - they understand the value of science'.120 At the XVth International Congress of Physiologists in 1935, and in his famous 'testament' to Russia's youth in 1936, the compliment was no longer backhanded: Our homeland opens up great expanses before scientists and... science is being introduced bountifully into the life of our country. Extremely bountifully. What can one say about the situation of the young scientist in our country? Here it is all clear. To him much is given, but from him much is asked. For the youth, as also for us, it is a matter of honor to justify all these great hopes placed upon science in our homeland.121 Steeped in the scientism of the 1860s, Pavlov saw the progress and cultural prestige of Soviet science as a momentous accomplishment with profound consequences. Science was 'the greatest and funda mental strength of mankind', he wrote late in life, destined not only to 'take from the limitless wealth of nature everything necessary and useful to people' but also to discipline the intellect and raise the cul tural level of mankind.122 This belief in science's civilizing influence may well have predis posed him to concentrate upon hopeful developments amidst the con tradictory political events of 1934-1935.123 In 1935, for example, he noted in a letter to Molotov that 'the longer your regime exists, the 120 Author's interview with Rita Rait Kovaleva, March 1977. 121 This 'testament' was widely published, and is found in I. P. Pavlov, Polnoe sobranie sochinenii, vol. 1, Moscow and Leningrad, 1951: 22-23. It is among Pavlov's papers in ARAN 259.1.72. His open ing remarks to the XVth International Congress of Physiologists were also widely published, and are found in the same volume of his collected works, pages 16-18. 122 See his short, unpublished manuscript on this subject, ARAN 259.1.68. 123 By 1934 there was considerable support within the Communist Party leadership for a more mod erate social and political course. The Seventeenth Communist Party Congress of that year witnessed a tentative effort to replace Stalin with Kirov as General Secretary. See R. Conquest (footnote 98), pp. 177 178. Throughout 1934 and 1935 Stalin publicly advocated this same 'politics of reconciliation', which was reflected in an improved supply of consumer goods, the 'cultural liberalism' of the Soviet Writer's Con gress, and, most dramatically, a much-publicized discussion of a new constitution. Simultaneously, how ever, Kirov was assassinated, almost certainly at Stalin's order, and a 'quiet terror' mounted toward its crescendo in 1936-1938. See Robert Tucker, Stalin in Power, New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1992: 282-288, 303-313, 353-356.</page><page sequence="34">412 DANIEL P. TODES further it departs from the extremes with which it began, allowing for actual reality instead of theoretical constructions.'124 That same year, after seeing a draft of the 'Stalin Constitution', which guaranteed such basic political freedoms as the closed ballot, he expressed his pleasure at the apparent dawn of a democratic era in the USSR. Ί have com plained many times about the oppressiveness of [our] life', he told a gathering of his coworkers. 'Now I want to say something different. It seems to me that our life is changing for the better... I want to believe that there is really occurring a turn toward a normal structure of life'.125 Five months later he praised the Soviet government for its generous support of Koltushi and added: Whatever I do, I think constantly that, insofar as my powers permit, I am serv ing my homeland. In my homeland there is now proceeding a grandiose social reconstruction. The terrible gap between rich and poor has been eliminated. And I want to live to see the final results of this social reconstruction.126 Pavlov's 'state patriotism' also brought him closer to the Bolsheviks. Russia's emergence as an industrial, military, and scientific power, and Stalin's turn from internationalism to 'socialism in one country', viti ated many of the criticisms he had voiced in the 1920s. Furthermore, Pavlov tended to close ranks with the Russian state in time of inter national crisis (as he had during World War I). By 1934 he was pre occupied with the threat of fascism, which, he warned Molotov, seemed likely to grow throughout Europe.127 He publicly applauded the Soviet Union's official policy of collective security: This opens up great perspectives for the development of science in our country. We want, not to make war, but to create... Mr. Hitler wants to make war... Give Mr. Hitler a free hand and he will immediately attempt to swallow us and anybody else like a fly. This is why we should especially sympathize with and facilitate our government's struggle for peace.128 One provincial scientist who had enjoyed swapping anti-Soviet jokes with Pavlov and his coworkers in the 1920s discovered that things had ™ ARAN 259.la.39: 1. 125 These remarks, from the Pavlovian Wednesday of 6 February 1935, are found in a typed, unsigned document in ARAN 259.1.112. V. K. Fadeeva, a participant in these Wednesday conferences, recalled this comment during my interview with her on 6 March 1991. According to Roy Medvedev, Bukharin drafted the Constitution's section on the rights and obligations of Soviet citizens. See R. Medvedev (footnote 103), p. 102. 126 'Akademik I. P. Pavlov ο Sovetskoi Rodine', Izvestiia, 6 July 1935. 127 Letter from I. P. Pavlov to V. M. Molotov, 21 December 1934, ARAN 259.la.30. Pavlov's empha sis on the threat posed by fascism echoed the sentiments of Nikolai Bukharin, his closest contact in the Communist Party leadership. See S. F. Cohen (footnote 67), pp. 360-363. 128 From a long interview with Pavlov in Izvestiia, 18 August 1935.</page><page sequence="35">PAVLOV AND THE BOLSHEVIKS 413 changed when he told a similar anecdote in 1934: 'It is a scoundrel,' Pavlov snapped at him, 'who undermines his government when the homeland is in danger.'129 Pavlov and the Secret Police There is no evidence that Pavlov feared arrest, but the secret police (NKVD) followed him closely.130 By the end of the 1920s a network of informers reported continuously about his conversations in the lab oratory, on the street, and even with his family. The great bulk of these surveillance reports remain inaccessible, but four that have been unearthed permit a tentative argument about their usefulness to the authorities.131 Detailed information about Pavlov's moods and intentions enabled the state to influence his behavior through the timely intervention of those around him. Pavlov could speak his mind freely, but nobody around him enjoyed that privilege. Those closest to him had differing attitudes about Soviet power, but all had their own interests. Bukharin and Fedorov had Pavlov's ear and could always be mobi lized when necessary. Also important in this regard was Maria Kapi tanovna Petrova, Pavlov's assistant and lover. Their relationship was common knowledge within Pavlov's circle (let alone to the NKVD), and Petrova - motivated by some combination of conviction, oppor tunism, and fear - could be depended upon to prod Pavlov at criti cal moments. The pervasiveness of this surveillance is evident in a report on Pavlov's activities at the time of his 85th birthday in 1934. 'Under the influence of his son [Vsevolod]', the report began, Pavlov decided to evade official celebrations of his birthday, and left for his home at Koltushi on 26 September, leaving instructions not to reveal his desti nation. His family joined him the next morning. At 3:45 in the after noon an official delegation (well-apprised of Pavlov's location) deliv ered a packet of greetings from the Sovnarkom. Pavlov was 'very moved'. 129 Author's interview with V. K. Fadeeva, 6 March 1991. 130 The Soviet secret police, initially the Cheka, became the GPU in 1922, the OGPU in 1924, and the NKVD in 1934. 131 F. F. Perchenok relates third-hand information to the effect that by the 1930s the NKVD pos sessed five volumes of these surveillance reports. See F. Perchenok (footnote 76), p. 190. Iu. A. Vino gradov, also drawing on a second-hand conversation, told me the same thing in 1991. My impression from the four reports I discovered in the Communist Party archive in St. Petersburg is that surveillance reports were filed weekly.</page><page sequence="36">414 DANIEL P. TODES After this, having gathered all the members of his family and having read the greeting, Pavlov announced: Ί thought the government's greetings would simply be published in the press and never expected to receive a personal greeting above the signature of the President of the Sovnarkom, Molotov. Now that's enough. I will hear no more [objections to participating in official celebrations of my birthday] and if I succeed in living until the next one I will act according to my conscience. I will celebrate the jubilee as one is supposed to, that is, with all the ceremonies...' The entire family listened to the academician's statement with tense attention and without a single comment or objection.132 Pavlov then agreed to attend a small banquet in his honor that even ing at Maria Petrova's home. In an expansive mood, he even invited a number of other guests (including two leading Communist adminis trators and his chauffeur). The source related numerous details about the evening, including a revealing comment by Maria Petrova. Allud ing to the anti-Soviet views of Pavlov's younger son, she assured one Communist that she used every opportunity to convince Pavlov of the 'baseness' of Vsevolod's behavior. Pavlov, alas, always insisted on the bond of 'parental feelings'.133 When Pavlov drafted a letter for publication in Izvestiia thanking institutions and individuals for their greetings on his birthday, Bukharin returned it to him, pointing to one impolitic inaccuracy. 'Academician Pavlov was much disturbed', an informer reported, and berated himself in a conversation with a coworker: I have really committed much stupidity with my jubilee and now I don't know how to extricate myself from this situation. I should have marked my jubilee in the established way. By my letter to the editor of Izvestiia I have caused much trouble for Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin, which I didn't want to do. I wouldn't want to embarrass Bukharin. I am prepared to do everything that Bukharin rec ommends.134 This report illustrates Pavlov's dependence upon Bukharin in com plex political affairs, and also raises a question that is presently unanswerable: how was such information about Pavlov's psychologi cal reactions used to manipulate this spontaneous and emotional man, especially given his contradictory sentiments about the Soviet government? The state's use of its information and influence was clearly at play in the process culminating in Pavlov's praise of the USSR at the XVth International Congress of Physiologists (1935).

The goals were to enhance the USSR's international prestige and showcase its achievements in science, industry, and agriculture. Bukharin apparently played an important role in convincing Pavlov to lend his considerable prestige to this effort, which proved decisive in overcoming political objections within the international physiological community.135 As preparations for the congress moved forward, however, Pavlov began to vacillate. In September 1934 the NKVD reported to Le ningrad's Secret Political Section that an 'anti-Soviet group' led by Pavlov's son Vsevolod and including several of Pavlov's coworkers was attempting to 'provoke Pavlov's return to his former anti-Soviet posi tions'. This group had almost persuaded Pavlov to 'write a letter of apology to his foreign colleagues, saying that he had been mistaken to invite them to conduct the work of the next International Congress in the USSR'. Here the archival record breaks off, but it seems likely that the Party mobilized its contacts around Pavlov to prevent im pending disaster. Pavlov never sent the letter, and work on the con gress proceeded.136 As the congress approached, the Political Section of the Organizing Committee directed the Commissar of Public Health, G. N. Kamin skii, who enjoyed good relations with Pavlov, to 'reach agreement with Academician Pavlov about final editorial work on his introductory speech'137. Fedorov and Petrova also urged Pavlov to include in his comments a statement of support for the Soviet Union's foreign poli cy. Perhaps under their influence, he added to the prepared typescript a warm sentence that caused a sensation in the Soviet press and abroad: 'And I am happy that the government of my mighty home land, struggling for peace, is the first in history to proclaim: 'Not an inch of foreign soil!'138 - an allusion to Stalin's slogan renouncing all extraterritorial ambitions. 135 GARF (Moscow) 8429.5.15 and 7668.1.827.

She points out that, while Pavlov signed his letters to Molotov with the formal 'Academician Iv. Pavlov,' he closed his letter to Kaminskii with the more personal 'Your devoted Iv. Pavlov' . See her 'Narkom Zdravookhraneniia G. N. Kaminskii'. In: M. G. Iaroshevskii (ed.), Repressirovannaia nauka, Leningrad: Nauka, 1991: 461, 466. 138 The original manuscript, with Pavlov's handwritten changes to the prepared typed text, is in ARAN 259.1.114. Pavlov's speech convening the Congress was widely published, for example in: I. P. Pavlov, Polnoe sobranie sochinenii, 2nd edition, vol. 1, Moscow and Leningrad: 1951: 16-18.</page><page sequence="38">416 DANIEL P. TODES The point here is not that Pavlov was compelled to make this state ment, or that he did not express himself sincerely. Rather, this phrase, like his participation in the Congress itself, was the product, not only of Pavlov's sincere sentiments, but also of his circle and a well informed apparatus that manipulated that circle for its own ends. The same, no doubt, was true of much else in his final years. Conclusion Only upon his death on February 26, 1936, did Pavlov became 'entirely ours', for his passing fully opened the floodgates to legend. Each legend, of course, contains a grain of truth, but, as we have seen, the man was more complex than the legends portray. What can we say of the 'Pavlov, the non-Party Bolshevik' created by Soviet mythmakers? Pavlov's attitude toward the Bolsheviks did become more positive in the final years of his life, when he cooperat ed with the Communist state to bring the XVth International Con gress of Physiologists to the USSR, praised the government warmly before an international audience, and even accepted nomination to the Koltushi Soviet. Yet this 'non-Party Bolshevik' never relinquished his basic criticisms of state policies, attempted on numerous occasions to save innocent victims of political arrest, and, apparently, was pre vented only by timely state intervention from scuttling the XVth Con gress just months before it was scheduled to convene in Leningrad. To the end of his days he openly celebrated Christmas at Koltushi, lec turing his Communist coworkers on the importance of marking the day of Jesus's birth. Today, Russian democrats are well on their way to creating the myth of 'Pavlov the first dissident', but this too is a partial reading. Pavlov did attack the Communist Party openly and eloquently throughout the 1920s, and less publicly in the 1930s, targetting its dogmatic official philosophy, persecution of religion, restrictions upon the autonomy of science and scientists, and use of terror as an instru ment of state policy. Yet the word 'dissident' hardly fits the man who had at his disposal virtually unlimited funds and a chauffered limou sine, and who, with a letter to the appropriate commissar, could have a street (or the president of the Academy of Sciences) relocated to a spot he found more convenient. Each tale, then, contains a kernel of truth, but both share a com mon error: they rely upon a highly selective collection of Pavlov's political statements, treating him as a disembodied political theorist.</page><page sequence="39">PAVLOV AND THE BOLSHEVIKS 417 Pavlov indeed had political views, but it was science, not politics, that consumed him on a daily basis and shaped his experience in Soviet Russia. The defining element in Pavlov's relationship to the state, I think, was his success as a scientist and institution-builder. Although he lam basted the Bolsheviks in the 1920s, he devoted considerably more time and effort to assuring their patronage of his scientific empire and defending his right to reign over it as he saw fit. And the most con sistent theme of his overtly political comments - for example, his 1923 critique of Bukharin, his 1928-1929 resistance to the Bolshevization of the Academy of Sciences, and his 1929 speech at the Sechenov jubilee - was his defense of the autonomy of science. In the end, Pavlov achieved for himself what he, and much of Rus sia's scientific community, hoped to achieve for that community as a whole: material comfort, high social status, generous state patronage, and exemption from administrative intrusion and demands for ideo logical conformity. Pavlov had acquired real clout: not only could he increase the food ration of needy coworkers and find them a good job; he could also, within limits, reward them with an overseas trip - or save them from the gulag. His ability to build his scientific enter prise and to do good deeds derived from the simple fact that he had become an honored member of the new established order. As the director of a large state enterprise, Pavlov formed normal working relations with the state apparatus and its representatives. Over the years his hatred of 'the Communists' became more textured - reflect ed, perhaps, in his frequent use of the scolding phrase 'Communist gentlemen' - as a result of the professional and personal encounters that flowed from his successful empire-building. Some Communists were good lab workers, others were effective administrators, and still others (including such Party leaders as Bukharin and Kaminskii) seemed intelligent and humane. In Fedorov, Pavlov recognized not only a Communist ideologue and political functionary, but also a hardworking physiologist, an able administrator, a well-connected sup porter, a family protector, and an avid partner in his favorite sport, outdoor stick-bowling (gorodki). This is not to say that Pavlov was simply bought or co-opted. With out question he possessed a deeply-felt sense of morality. Yet his moral judgments, too, owed much to his beliefs as a man of science. As he wrote to Bishop Luke in 1925: 'In this difficult time, full of relentless grief for those who think and feel, who feel in a human way, there remains only one support in life - to fulfill one's duty insofar as one's powers permit.' Pavlov considered his duty to be the pursuit of</page><page sequence="40">418 DANIEL P. TODES his own research and the defense of Russian science. Science, in his view, was 'the greatest and fundamental strength of mankind'. Just as the achievements of tsarist science had outlived the tsarist regime, so might a flourishing Soviet science transcend, and perhaps even soften, the barbarities of the state that nurtured it. Despite considerable discomfort with one another, then, Pavlov and the Bolsheviks managed to negotiate a relationship in which both gained what they most wanted. Pavlov was able to maintain control over an ever-expanding scientific empire, to pursue his research pro ductively and without financial limitation, and to live a comfortable life in accordance with the dictates of his conscience. The Bolsheviks were able to showcase a Nobel laureate working creatively in revolu tionary Russia, to turn his international prestige to their larger policy goals, and to prepare a generation of fully Soviet heirs for the day when Pavlov passed from the scene.
