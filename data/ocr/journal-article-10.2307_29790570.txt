<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONSUMING THE MAYA K. Anne Pyburn K. Anne Pyburn is Associate Professor, Department of Anthropology, at Indiana University in Bloomington. (T)he problem is a failure to be conscious of essentialism, whether it springs from the assumptions with which we approach our subjects or the goals that motivate our writing.1 The powerful symbolism of owning treasures from the past of another nation has been attractive to many conquerors. The Aztec looted Toltec sites for artifacts to ally them with a heroic past. Romans decorated their gardens with old Greek statuary. Egyptology was begun by French scholars and adventurers when Napoleon's invasion of Egypt collected monuments for display in France and England.2 These were not just the trophies of colonialist regimes, they emphasized a break between the present and the past, allying the present day victors with a glorious past thought to have surpassed the quality of the cultures lately vanquished. Ancient Egyptian art was as worthy of display in Paris as the products of the people Napoleon conquered, tacitly, people whose splendor was receding and who, according to the logic of the conqueror, might just as well be dominated. Maya artifacts provide a case in point. Contemporary museums display ancient Maya material culture as "high art," whereas products of living Maya people are crafts or "folk art." This focus on the lost greatness of antiquity has two consequences: it creates a dismissive attitude toward the present, and it patronizes the past. The goal is to demonstrate a comparable level of sophistication between modern connoisseurs and ancient artists, while at the same time emphasizing the experiential gulf between the two. In fact, the greater the distance between cultures in both time and in use of Dialectical Anthropology 23: 111-129, 1998. ? 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</page><page sequence="2">112 forms of expression, the greater the virtuosity of connoisseurship displayed. Since academic archaeology in the Maya lowlands was begun by employees of American museums, it is not surprising that the resulting picture of ancient Maya culture is heavily exoticized. Today, both the popular press and academic researchers contribute to this image of inscrutability and mystery. Modern connoisseurship of ancient Maya material culture has become almost entirely self-referential; iconographic interpretation relies on nested assumptions and the beliefs of historians about cultural continuity from ancient to modern times. In reality, the ancient Maya were not as mysterious or as unchanging as they are usually depicted (especially to the public), but were somewhat more mundane, and may have become "modern" sometime before the ninth century. I propose a Maya cultural history that includes a transition from a "traditional" to a "consumer" society, during which ancient Americans came to participate in a complex system of mass consumption related to the rise of an economic world system and a view of themselves as modern. Presumably, this model will be very familiar to the reader, though not in the context of Maya studies. In the quest for laws of human behavior, anthropologists of the early twentieth century regarded consumer behavior as a measure of the evolutionary grade achieved by a culture, related to population density, specialist production and the harnessing of energy.3 This concept of unilinear cultural progress gave rise to such dreary artifacts of Western intellectual tradition as the "bands?tribes? chiefdoms?states model" of the rise of civilization. This is the anthropological version of ontogeny-recapitulates-phylogeny, every culture begins with a band level of organization and proceeds through ever greater levels of complexity, although only certain cultures evolve all the way to states and true civilization. Antique and inadequate though this model may be,4 it persists in robust form in American archaeology.5 On the other hand, historians have usually treated the rise of consumer society as a unique reaction to a specific set of events that occurred in sixteenth century Europe, emphasizing the uniqueness of Western experience. In order to establish such singularity, close</page><page sequence="3">113 comparisons with other cultures emphasize contrasts. Edward Said has pointed out that when differences have been dramatically overdrawn, our ability to comprehend an alternative social milieu is seriously stunted.1 In order for us to see ourselves as progressive and modern, we must envision an alternative that is traditional and primitive.7 Both the views of the other as depraved primitive or as noble savage can be understood as simple counterpoints to Western ideas of rational economic individuals burdened by the cross of civilization. Critiques of this perspective by J?rgen Habermas, Daniel Miller, and even Said,8 still situate modernity as a unique Western development, unlikely to have been experienced in any non Western context. They seem sure that the arrogance of modernity is a distinctively Western trait. Clearly, an archaeologist working with Maya data should try to avoid either the evolutionary nomothetic or the historical ideographic camp. An archaeologist must have some interest in cultural similarities and parallels of human experience; without predictable patterns and cross cultural regularities, the gaps in the archaeological record loom too large. But modern empirical studies do not support the model of culture as a system progressing through a lock-step trajectory of stages. In fact, though human behavior is not exactly random, its predictability remains low, despite highly motivated and well funded research by advertisers, stock brokers and politicians desperate to know what people are going to do. At any rate, the problem with either perspective is that both begin with the assumptions about human history and society that most need empirical testing. Is modernism really unique? Can traditionalism always be assumed among pre-industrial non-Western societies? The following discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of all relevant data, but only a backward glance at some well-heeled assumptions about the ancient Maya. Although some of my analogies are whimsical, my goal is to show that models of ancient Maya economy and society have begun to be impervious to data. But this is not a criticism of a scientific approach, I am criticizing the pretense of science. Too many of our conclusions have become foregone, so that opposite findings are often used to support the same hypothesis.</page><page sequence="4">114 For example, up through the 1960s, archaeologists maintained that the ancient Maya were unable to develop true cities because their extensive style of swidden agriculture prevented them from achieving urban population densities. If a farmer must move his fields every three to seven years, eventually his fields will be too far from town for urban dwelling to be feasible, especially without draft animals or wheeled vehicles. Then, in the early 1970s new data on ancient Maya agriculture began to accumulate, as the New Archaeology emphasized environmental factors' influence on cultural process.9 Drained fields, raised fields, terraces and various types of fertilization were all identified ethnographically or archaeologically in the Maya lowlands.10 The result of these data has been that Mayanists now argue that the ancient Maya were unable to develop true cities because their intensive agriculture had a centrifugal influence on settlement, pulling dwellings away from nucleated areas and closer to labor intensive cultivation areas.11 Either way, presumptions held at the start of investigations prevent most archaeologists from really searching for evidence of dense populations. It should be no surprise that abandonment of perishable housing and re-use of land and materials in a tropical environment for one thousand years makes some data scarce, but this has had no impact on the dominant paradigm.12 Maya settlements are sometimes now referred to as "urban," but it is tacitly accepted that these communities were not densely nucleated and stratified by occupation and class the way that early European or Middle Eastern cities were.13 (Of course without beginning assumptions about contrasting settlement patterns, early European, Egyptian, and Near Eastern Cities do not look exactly urban in all respects, either.) The Maya were not really an urban civilization because 1) they had no intensive agriculture, or 2) they were too dependent on intensive agriculture. The data change but the presumption remains intact. If we step around traditional assumptions about the Maya, there is some support for the claim that not only were the Maya as urban as any other preindustrial civilization, but underwent something similar to European-style modernization about a century before their civilization collapsed. Maya modernization involved the development of a concept of presentness, as defined by Miller,14 that</page><page sequence="5">115 can be seen in Maya political propaganda, and a fascination with progressive linear time that can be discerned in their mathematics, calendar, art and architecture. The Maya Classic period, which might be called the Maya Modern period, also saw the rise of both conspicuous and mass consumption. And it would be ethnocentric to assume that these developments were not accompanied by a rise in self consciousness about social policy, at least among ancient Maya social philosophers, despite the fact that none of their theories about "man in the state of nature" have come down to us as written documents. The iconography is certainly arrogant enough, and the political strategies ruthless enough, to qualify the Maya as modern. The dramatic restructuring of society that took place at the end of the ninth century did not actually result in the disappearance of Maya culture, but ushered in a Maya postmodern period known to us as the Maya Postclassic. Of course this is tongue in cheek, but it shows how difficult it is to separate reasonably objective data from what Mayanists think about themselves as purveyors of the Western Great tradition, whether they consider this an asset or a liability. Treating the ancient Maya as modern shows that some obvious questions have never been asked. But to do this requires that evidence for ancient Maya consumption patterns be considered simultaneously with evidence for contemporary consumption of the ancient Maya past, by both academics and an admiring public audience. Applying the concept of modernity to an ancient culture is a tricky thing, since it tampers with the myth themes that Western scholars use to understand themselves and challenges basic definitions of what it means to exist outside the traditions of Western analysis and philosophy.15 Modernity, by definition, denotes a contrast between the past and the present.16 In fact, modernism is one type of orientalism17 in that modernism requires the creation of a cultural other that sits in contrast to the modern, just as the oriental perspective creates the occidental perspective.18 The element of time in Maya studies is used in a curious way, since most Mayanists see a fundamental unity in Maya culture extending not only through space but through time, even into the present day. Gary Gossen, for example, wrote in the inaugural issue of the newly designed</page><page sequence="6">116 American Anthropologist "the language of souls (which is a type of discourse he witnessed among the Tzotzil) has fundamentally to do with Mesoamerican construction of self and social identity, destiny, and power, as much now as has apparently been the case for two thousand years in Mexico and Central America."19 But the contemporaniety of Maya cultural practices and ideology are not seen to recontextualize their ancient patterns in the modern world. The Maya of today are invariably said to be living in the past, and are therefore subordinate to their mysterious but culturally pure distant ancestors. There is an unusual situation between academic disciplines focused on Mesoamerican data.20 Usually, archaeologists are toiling along behind cultural and social anthropologists, snatching up bits of cultural theory that anthropologists have done with and discarded. But in the case of Maya Studies, cultural anthropologists studying Maya groups continue to supply essays on world view and geist that would be considered passe by scholars working in other culture areas. Oddly, as archaeologists have become more chary about asserting broad cosmological continuity among the Maya from AD 500 to the present, ethnographers have become progressively more willing to make such statements. These dramatically simplify the archaeologist's task of interpreting the past, and also the task of presenting archaeological data to the public, since an orientalist perspective is unvaryingly popular in the West; the Mysterious Maya sell like hot cakes. For example, the identification of makers' marks on pottery and donors' marks on stelae21 might suggest a more ordinary view of Maya economic life as similar to that of other preindustrial civilizations, but these discoveries have not affected the prior belief in the absence of economically independent specialist producers. According to most Mayanists, the Maya did not really have goods at all, only necessities and ceremonial objects, so the idea of the Maya as consumers makes no sense: ". . .the pattern is non-urban geographically dispersed lowland craft production locals, a pattern which has parallels with the village (part time) specialization found in highland Maya groups today."22 In contrast to this traditional view of the traditional ancient Maya, moderns are economically alienated and over-specialized, self</page><page sequence="7">117 conscious and reflexive, and disconnected from tradition. Miller says, "The core dilemma of modernity lies in the consequences of the new temporality: that is, a distinct sense of present, past and future, which leads to an increasing concern with the knowledge of self construction of the criteria by which we live."23 By this definition, Mayanists such as David A. Freidel, Linda Scheie, and Joy Parker are certainly modern. "We are forced," they tell us," to acknowledge that our perception of the past is always a prisoner of the present."24 But their self-conscious modernity is clearly reified and made explicit through their vision of a premodern Maya other. So, although eager to give the Maya history by translating hieroglyphs, it must necessarily be a non-Western type of history; it must not have a modern sense of linear time. Instead, tremendous emphasis is placed by almost all Maya epigraphers on a Maya belief in cyclical time. Admittedly, the Maya recorded sequential events, but, supposedly, they could only understand these events as repetitions in an endless cycle; they could not have suffered from presentness, as do their modern devotees, but faithfully saw current events as renewals of the past.25 This reconstruction is too simple. Data on Maya history and culture can be interpreted very differently, especially if we do not set out with the assumption that the Maya were traditional and premodern, but ask if they might have been progressive and modern. Unfortunately, the Maya recorded little direct information about their economy and political organization. We have no personal documents or correspondence, no economic records or inventories of any kind. So far, we mostly have lists of kings recounted in stone, for obvious reasons, by their successful progeny, records of public political events, a bit of astronomical data, some myths and some magical formulae. But documents are themselves artifacts, and require context just as other types of material culture. In a way, archaeological data, which consist almost exclusively of the detritus of what has actually been consumed, are the ultimate source of information about consumer behavior. People rarely worry about editing their garbage.26</page><page sequence="8">118 The greatest shortcoming of Maya data for an investigation of their consumption patterns is our lack of knowledge about ancient production.27 Most of the relevant data have been collected under the assumption that production was exclusively at the household level, except for occasional instances of elite-attached specialists. It has been assumed that the Maya did not have factories, since this type of rationalization is thought to have been beyond their level of achievement. Even the nature of Maya marketing systems remains unclear, at least partly because systematic study of the possibilities has been lacking. Some exchange between households and even communities is suspected by most Mayanists, but not to the extent of economic interdependence.28 Most scholars still maintain that the distribution of minor palaces in an ancient Maya city reflects the presence of agricultural fields and gardens cultivated by the resident princes, whose household wealth was determined by the quality of the soil their palace sat on. For example: "It is clear from spatial distributions of plaza groups and terraced fields at Caracol that many of these (elite) people were located in areas that suggest an immediate relationship with agricultural fields. The simplistic model of a nonfarming elite and a farming peasantry is contradicted by the Caracol data."29 The possibility that elite residences were on residential platforms and employed decorative and symbolic uses of space is not discussed. The widespread acceptance of this odd paradigm is itself worthy of anthropological analysis. At the height of the Classic Period (ca AD 800), the Maya city of Tikal had no fewer than fifty thousand residents, and probably many more.30 Much of the archaeological data from this city come from the investigation of the city center, where huge administrative structures and elite residences were built in an imposing style that made lavish use of open space. Under the conditions of extreme crowding which probably existed in many parts of the city, the use of great open public areas to emphasize power is a form of conspicuous consumption. The presence of orchards and gardens in these areas does not mean that elite households were economically dependent on their immediate environment, only that they could afford pleasant and convenient surroundings on prime real estate. Residents of elite structures, that is large palaces built on platforms</page><page sequence="9">119 above the mud, mosquitoes and neighbors, had access to a wide variety of both locally produced and foreign consumer goods. The distribution of obsidian (the only consumer item from outside the lowlands that does occur in mass quantities in the archaeological record) at Tikal is interesting, since the stuff associated with elite houses seems to usually come from a different source from the stuff used by ordinary people.31 This suggests a difference between classes in the means of procurement: perhaps the elite owned their own mines or had special family connections, while everyone else had to buy from the market. Pottery, the other object of mass consumption, is also very interesting. Although the variety of types of paste suggests that pottery was made in many locations, the astonishing similarity of form and decoration between sites as early as 600 BC strongly suggests specialists and mass production.32 Mayanists have long treated the consistency in ceramic styles as evidence of the existence of a pervasive Maya world view, assuming that the Maya all made the same pottery because they were all Maya, even though they may have spoken different languages and might never have traveled outside their natal villages.33 Recent experiments in low-tech pottery production have shown conclusively that even if you have exactly the same materials as your neighbor, it is much harder to make an exact duplicate of another pot than to make something similar.34 Clearly, a great amount of effort was being expended to achieve uniformity in some goods, while, in the inner circles of the elite, there was also an appreciation of creativity and uniqueness, as evidenced by the existence of ceramic pots that may have been marked as the products of particular workshops. Another interesting form of conspicuous consumption appears in the production of useless artifacts made in a baroque style from utilitarian materials. Eccentric flints are dandified tools, if there ever were any; these are artifacts of chipped stone that would ordinarily have been used to make knives or hoes, but that are instead chipped to resemble anthropomorphic figures or decorative designs. So much virtuosity is displayed in the manufacture of these objects that there is little doubt that they were made by professional flintknappers, and their quantity over the Maya lowlands is so enormous that they must</page><page sequence="10">120 certainly have been mass produced. Caches and tombs at Altun Ha, possibly a manufacturing center, contained hundreds.35 Of course, data on perishable consumables such as food, or cloth, or feather objects, are missing from the archaeological context. Ethnohistoric documents from the Postclassic period, when Cortez appeared, do mention trade in such items by the postmodern Maya and other later cultural groups, such as the Aztec. But the existence of trade and exchange is not proof of consumer culture; it is the quantity of such exchanges and the existence of bulk goods traveling to centers of demand that is essential to consumer society and an earmark of modernism. Opinions differ about just how much obsidian was imported into the Maya heartland from volcanic areas to the West, but when the quantity recovered is compared to the proportion of any site that has actually been excavated, the quantities seem impressive. This is especially the case since most excavation has been concentrated in the central areas of large settlements; not the likeliest place to find middens of volcanic glass chips from the manufacture of tools. Another kind of evidence for mass production could come from the comparative analysis of land use patterns. The site of Chau Hiix, for example, is near both Lamanai and Altun Ha in northern Belize. On a resource distribution map of the area, Chau Hiix has better soil than nearby Altun Ha, and appears to have had a smaller resident population. Nevertheless, Chau Hiix also has an area of seasonally inundated land that has been extensively modified to control drainage, and, possibly, to allow multicropping. This area covers many square kilometers and is in addition to the prime agricultural land on which the site is situated. Clearly, there is a motive for this, agricultural strategy beyond the immediate needs of the residents, since with poorer land and more people, Altun Ha has no evidence of such a strategy. Maya consumption of luxury goods and imports is traditionally consumed by archaeologists and the public as an indication of the exotic otherness of the ancient Maya. The fact that royalty ate better (skeletal evidence shows they were taller and had fewer diseases)36 and had fancier houses and more consumer goods is said to have been exclusively the result of an ideological system based on elite</page><page sequence="11">121 posturing and ceremonialism, supported by elite trade in exotics and a few attached specialists: "The most salient characteristic of these polities is the great importance of ritual performances in their ceremonial centers and the awe (and authority) that these displays generated."37 The significance of elite trade in sumptuary goods is long overdue for rethinking. Was most trade between Maya cities controlled by elites and focused on economically insignificant status insignia? If so the Maya were not highly economically differentiated, or politically very integrated, and certainly not consumers in the modern sense. Specialists, so the argument goes, could only be supported by royal houses, where they served the same function as sumptuary trade, by providing elites with goods not available to ordinary people to consume or exchange with other elites.38 Maya consumption is always hung with veils of mystification and the idea of economic gain is discounted. Maya kings needed feathers, jade, and polychrome pots to symbolize their power, not to achieve it. But Morris Silver39 has recently pointed out some rather pragmatically economic effects of elite trade and the rise of attached specialists. Trade in valuable inessentials establishes trust; and trust can allay threats of warfare and raiding. By exchanging "goodies," elites can test the reliability and the reciprocity of their neighbors and build up debts and credit. This kind of trade also establishes markets for goods: the fact that the king had something did not make it off limits for other Maya, since we find small quantities of exotic goods in the middens of modest homes. Elite trade can also begin to establish exchange values in a marketplace. How many jade beads is a hematite mirror worth? a slave? a complete set of dishes? a load of corn? Maya people lived in many different sizes and kinds of houses40 but had similar things (although not the same amounts of expensive things and not the same things as kings and princes). This has been interpreted to mean that Maya society had no economic basis to its organization. The argument41 is that if there were economically distinct classes, they would have different goods, not just different quantities of the same goods. This is another orientalist presumption. In an article on consumerism in eighteenth century Paris, Cissie Fairchilds42 mentions stonecutters and milkmen decked</page><page sequence="12">122 out in luxurious for muffs, silk knee breeches and lace cuffs, even when plying their trade. Probably, they did not have an unlimited supply of such items, but the mere fact of possessing them did not indicate the absence of economic class differences. Archaeologists studying the Maya have always considered iconography an indicator of social psychology. "The high art that has so fascinated the modern visitor is the public and private expression of world view through writing and narrative imagery."43 The most important purpose of this art, we are told, was to show "the cyclicality of the cosmic time in which . . . history unfolded .... The Maya were preoccupied with demonstrating historical action as the inevitable result of cosmic and ancestral necessities." but was this seamlessly true? Could the ancient Maya have had any of the psycho-social traits of European modernity. According to Habermas,44 European modernity was the result of three historical events: the reformation, the renaissance, and the discovery of the New World. Of course, it is perfectly possible to find parallels in the history of the Maya Classic Period; certainly conquest and exploitation of other groups and a fluorescence of ideology and art characterize the era. But at the risk of being too particularistic, I want to draw some comparisons on a much finer scale. Working with Habermas' ideas, Miller45 stresses a set of developments in art and iconography as a sort of signature of modernity. In fact, it is this set of characteristics that inspired this paper, since they fit Maya representations so nicely. Several authors have emphasized the shift in temporal consciousness that arose in sixteenth century Europe. At this time, Europeans are said to have become intensely aware of the passage of time and to have developed a sense of "presentness" that manifested itself in their behavior and their writing, but also in their art. Central to these developments was an entrenched concept of linear time, which contrasts sharply with Maya belief in cyclical time and their lack of a concept of progressive change or an emphasis on innovation. Indeed, the Maya short count repeats endlessly a series of 260 days and a cycle of 20 years. But the Maya long count calendar did not repeat dates and had a single mythological starting point. For all practical purposes, the juxtaposition of the long and</page><page sequence="13">123 the short count, which the Classic Maya used together to predict celestial events with great accuracy, provided an absolute dating system that makes it possible for modern epigraphers to know the exact day on which a Maya monument was dedicated. If there was no interest in the progress of time, why use the long count at all? Interestingly, its use stopped in the Postclassic, when the Maya went back to using only the short count. A postmodern loss of confidence in progress? Steven D. Houston46 believes the Maya recorded linear history with reasonable accuracy, albeit for pragmatic political reasons that affected what was chosen for the record and how it was presented. In fact, the same records that Scheie and Freidel47 interpret as emphasizing cyclical events can also be interpreted as indicating that the Classic Maya were interested in cultural progress. Their king lists and genealogies are not simply rosters lengthened with each new royal generation. Every one that has survived was produced during the reign of the last king on the list, and clearly shows progress through the increasing glory of his line, culminating in his own achievements. There is also evidence that Maya kings sometimes eradicated previous competing lists when they came to power by defacing monuments or "storing" them deep inside the structural fill of new temples. These kings were clearly not simply claiming to have renewed the greatness of the past generation and to have followed the path worn down by their forebears; these are claims of superiority and progress. Other monuments document progress over competing neighbors through victory in battle and the consummation of favorable alliances through marriage. Another interesting point of comparison is that sixteenth century European art developed the use of perspective, which implies a comprehension of a separation of actors from their context, indicating a sense of alienation or a new self-consciousness. The murals of Bonampak are certainly narrative, and show some depth of field, at least in the human subjects themselves. There are depictions of ball players on vases that show unusually large balls in play, possibly suggesting their relative proximity to the viewer. Sculpture of the latter part of the Classic (at least at some sites) makes a definite shift from a four-sided frieze to a truly dimensional</page><page sequence="14">124 representation. Also during this period, the rendering of movement, especially in depictions of ball players, dancers and warriors, becomes more dynamic.48 European paintings are also said to approach modernism by avoiding anachronistic depictions of ancient subjects. That is, paintings of events and characters from the distant past were depicted in fanciful versions of past costumes, rather than in clothing contemporary with the artist. A similar example from Maya art is a depiction of the ruler of Palenque, Pacal, dressed as an ancient deity known as "first father," and said to be wearing first father clothing. Although Freidel, Scheie and Parker see this as a supernatural clothing style,49 it might equally be interpreted as an attempt by a Classic period artist to depict a Preclassic fashion. First father was probably considered old fashioned! The idea of history? of periods and phases and change over time?is a horizon marker for the origins of both modernity and archaeology! Maya archaeology has always been big business. Western interpretations of Maya history have become the textbook example of the effects of the political present on our consumption of the past since Richard R. Wilk and Jeremy A. Sabloff50 showed explanations of the Maya collapse favored environmental over-exploitation around Earth Day, population pressure with the rise of the Zero Population Growth organization, and warfare at the first moratorium of the Vietnam War. Eric Thompson51 with his socialist leanings, romanticized the ancient Maya as egoless, otherworldly number worshippers. A.V. Kidder, with Jessie Jennings and Edwin M. Shook,52 took their art as intellectual trophies to the Carnegie museum. The Tikal Project, run by the University of Pennsylvania, established that school as preeminent in Maya studies for a generation. And the universalistic interpretation of the living Maya as keepers of timeless cultural heritage depicts them as traditional by choice, rather than through political oppression and grinding poverty.53 Artist Linda Scheie has risen to great prominence as the promoter of Maya Workshops at the University of Texas, which purport to usher students into the "mind of the ancient Maya." Essays on Maya traditionalism and geist have reached an ironic nadir in the work of Gary Gossen, who, in 1994, explained the Mexican political Zapatista movement as an outgrowth of ancient</page><page sequence="15">125 beliefs. Then, in 1996, he reviewed the movement and assessed the Zapatista employment of non-Maya leaders as an example of a pan Mesoamerican use of a Quetzaquatl type myth, in which a white foreign god-king from a distant polity provides legitimacy to Maya political aspirations. So powerful and unifying is this "essential Soul of Mesoamerican Indian culture,"54 that it has succeeded in unifying Indians of Mexico into a pan-Indian movement that includes people who do not consider themselves Indian. Since Gananath Obeskeyere55 has revealed how important the foreign god-king myth is in European cosmology, it is small wonder that Gossen is so pleased by his discovery of the apotheosis of Sebastian Guillen Vicente, a fair-skinned criollo, by the Zapatistas. Gossen has pronounced this political development a great success. "We are priviliged to witness, understand, and contribute to this optimistic turn in the modern history of Mesoamerica."56 Perhaps one day we will know whether the brilliant and educated Mr. Vicente, himself, read Obeskeyere and Gossen to supply himself with the vocabulary necessary for him to help the intellectuals of wealthy developed nations understand his desperate cause. At this point, it is not possible to know whether the orientalist logic of anthropology has informed or affected the Zapatista movement. Perhaps Gossen is seeing the authentic "other" he celebrates, or perhaps he has simply failed to recognize his own reversed image in the mirror. At any rate, the Maya are likely to continue for many years to come to serve as a great intellectual delicacy, consumed with relish by academics and the public alike. Having made our preferences known, we should not be too surprised to find that the table has been carefully set to please us. Notes 1.
