<plain_text><page sequence="1">DOI: 10.1111/j. 1468-2249.2012.00343.x ROBERT SNARRENBERG Brahms's Six Songs, Op. 3 Brahms's first bouquet of songs, six settings of four poets, shows that by early in the 1850s he was already a sensitive reader of lyric poetry and a composer who could write Romantic miniatures in which the smallest details bear con siderable significance - just the sort of craftsmanship that would have impressed Robert Schumann, who was himself such a composer. The texts of Op. 3 are connected by a narrative thread - glimpses into the life of a young woman who has experienced a tragedy - and the songs are musically linked in a variety of ways. I shall not attempt to answer the question of whether to regard the opus as a 'cycle', but I think there is sufficient evidence to warrant making the aesthetic claim that John Daverio regarded as implicit in such a designation: that the songs 'exhibit elements of musicopoetic cohesiveness extending beyond the individual lied to encompass the entire set'.1 Daverio's remark focuses the inquiry on what I consider the more interesting questions: what are the musicopoetic elements in the songs, and how, if at all, are they related? Answers to these questions take the form of detailed analysis, which is precisely what this essay attempts to provide; but it may help to indicate in advance some of the more obvious connections. Songs one and four, by dif ferent poets, relate to conversations between a daughter and her mother; both are in Et minor, and they have similar tonal plans and melodic contours. Songs two and three, a pair of poems by a single poet, are in the voice of a young person in love, quite possibly a woman; both are in B major, and they are linked by a musical quotation. And songs five and six, taken from a novella by Eichendorff, are sung by young women who are far from home; they are in the closely related keys of Fit minor and A major. I will eventually suggest possi bilities for interpreting all six songs in narrative terms. Furthermore, I will suggest ways in which the songs often make available musical experiences that parallel to some degree the inner life of the poetic persona. No. 1, 'Liebestreu' (Robert Reinick) This poem concerns the plight of a heartbroken daughter. Implored by her mother to abandon her feelings, the daughter resists. Three times the mother pleads with her daughter, and three times the daughter protests. In each utterance the mother repeats a phrase, like a parent exasperated by her child's recalcitrance; she adds rhetorical force to her demands by clipping the final, unstressed vowels of key words. With mounting impatience she tries to sever the bonds of feeling connecting the daughter to her lover - bonds of sorrow, love and troth which, in Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) ©2012 The Author.

In each of her replies, the daughter draws a word or image from her mother's entreaty and uses it to express the constancy of her feelings. Clearly the text mandates not only a contrast within each stanza but also a thread of connection. And since a child's repeated refusal to comply with a demand heightens the tension, as any parent knows, the text also warrants some form of intensification from one stanza to the next. 'O versenk', o versenk' dein Leid, mein Kind, in die See, in die tiefe See!' Ein Stein wohl bleibt auf des Meeres Grund, mein Leid kommt stets in die Höh'. 'Und die Lieb', die du im Herzen trägst, brich sie ab, brich sie ab, mein Kind!' Ob die Blum' auch stirbt, wenn man sie bricht, treue Lieb' nicht so geschwind. 'Und die Treu', und die Treu', 's war nur ein Wort, in den Wind damit hinaus'. O Mutter, und splittert der Fels auch im Wind, meine Treue, die hält ihn aus. ['Oh sink, oh sink your sorrow, my child, in the sea, in the deep sea!' A stone may well rest on the ocean's bottom; my sorrow rises always to the surface. 'And the love that you bear in your heart, break it off, break it off, my child!' Even if the blossom dies when one breaks it off, true love does not pass so swiftly. 'And troth, and troth, 'tis but a word, into the wind with it'. Oh Mother, even if the crag splinters in the wind, my troth, it will withstand it.]2 Since the mother's words are quoted while the daughter's are presented as direct discourse, the voice of the poem is that of the daughter. And although the actions and events that give rise to and ensue from this conversation are left unsaid, we can surmise that the conversation occurs at a critical moment in the narrative: after some event has disturbed the equilibrium of the daugh ter's betrothal and before she has made any decision that would ease her suffering. The pianist begins 'Liebestreu' with restless, almost nervous pulsations in the right hand and then, in the left hand, a rising motive, oddly placed so that the long note falls on what will turn out to be a weak beat. Another unsettling aspect of the opening gesture is the contrast of triplets in one hand and duplets in the other. The soprano enters at the midpoint of the left hand's first motive with her Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author. Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT SNARRENBERG own version of it, rising from the triad's third to its fifth rather than from root to third. Following the bass's lead, she repeats the motive, musically enacting the mother's repeated words, 'O versenk', o versenk". After the bass starts the motive a third time, the soprano alters her imitation, starting higher and stretching the basic interval of the motive into a sixth in an impassioned approach to gl»2 and the mother's first reference to her daughter's sorrow. Then, in a reversal of roles, the bass imitates the soprano, subsequently expanding the motive to an octave. The soprano, meanwhile, turns the motive downwards as the mother implores her daughter to cast her sorrow down into the sea's depths. A second wave, rising and falling, leads down to her cadence on f1. It is as if the mother herself - her line now rising, now falling - casts the sorrow ('Leid') of the high gt2 into the depths of her vocal register, to the low gl»1 within her utterance of the word 'deep' ('tiefe'), which, because of its dissonant position above the bass At, pulls her line down even further. The counterpoint of the motives has been harsh and restless: each of the soprano's motives begins with an accented dissonance, and the unsettled staggering of entries continues until the voice comes to rest in bar 5 and the two lines finally meet in an undisturbed consonance.These musical effects fit the mother's turbulent emotional state. How does the daughter respond? Dreamily, says Brahms. And with less turmoil. Although the duplets against triplets continue, the contrapuntal disso nance and motivic friction between the voice and the bass disappear entirely. Indeed, the bass line itself disappears when the right hand floats into a higher octave, so that most of what happens in the next five bars lies in a register high above the accompaniment to the mother's music. And rather than conflicting with the vocal line, the piano now doubles it, at first in the left hand and then an octave higher in the right. The temporary absence of a bass line in bars 6-7 contributes to the dreamy quality of the moment, as do the harmonic effects: following on the heels of the imperfect cadence in bar 5, the 3 chord in bar 6 does not sound like a new tonic beginning; if anything, the voices seem as if they might act as neighbours to a Bt major triad, repeating the progression of bars 4-5 (see Exs la and b). But that is not what happens.The harmony does not progress to V when the upper voice descends to f2. Instead, f2 and at2 are retained while d&gt;2 and ó2 converge on d?2, so that with the progression into bar 7, it seems as if the passage will slip away from the E? minor of the mother's song and settle in Gt Ex. 1 'Liebestreu', harmonic progressions in the daughter's music: (a) bars 4-5; (b) bar 6; (c) bars 6-7; (d) bars 28-29 (a) (i u 6 r '■k 77 (c ) f# 4" &gt; pf^ J J |J XT 1= M l±&lt;£—_—L ek IV Gt&gt;: II V I ek II © 2012 The Author.

The pianist's left hand begins in unison with the voice in bar 6, but at the very moment she mentions her sorrow, in bar 8, the left hand parts company with her line; the left hand breaks faith, as it were, first by playing d!&gt;2 as a crotchet on the fourth beat and then by leaping up to ft2 in bar 8, which forms a dissonant second with gl.2 in the vocal line. The vocal line counters the divergence by leaping down into a line that rises up to meet the resolution of the left hand's ft2. At the end of bar 8 the vocal line is joined by the right hand in the next higher octave, these two lines together ascending steadily upwards to Et; the parallel with the text is obvious. The protracted duration of the Gt major chord in bars 8-9 and the slower pace of declamation fit the daughter's lingering attachment to her lover, and the ft2 that colours the chord transforms the feeling of a tonic into the feeling of a dominant, from a feeling of rest to a feeling of desire. And the failure to remain within a single tonality suits her uncertainty. The daughter's conflict with her mother is projected in a variety of ways, starting with the fact that the harmonic progression does not come to rest in El minor.3 After the mother sets up a metaphorical parallel between abandoning sorrow and casting something heavy into the sea, the daughter picks up the metaphor and uses it as a point of contrast. For her, there is an inverse relation between a heavy stone that sinks to the ocean floor and her irrepressible sorrow. True, she owns to her sorrow, but her sorrow is mixed with desire and fidelity. Brahms composes suitable musical contrasts. Both mother and daughter leap to gl»2 at the mention of sorrow ('Leid'), but in bar 3, gl&gt;2 is the octave of a tonic 3 chord, while in bar 8 it is the octave of an equivocal dominant and forms a dissonance against the seventh in the piano. The daughter's rising line presents a stark contrast to the mother's melody: both are fourth-progressions that depart from b&gt;' (see Ex. 2), but they move in opposite directions. The tonal contrast between the mother's plea, in an El- minor triad, and the daughter's response, which settles on a Cl&gt; major triad, is marked by the exchange of b?1 and o2. The contrast is subtly delineated, first by the opening notes of the daughter's line, bt'-d2, and then in bar 11 by the right hand, which slips from one triad to the other with a reversal of this move as it floats back down into the lower register.

Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="5">6 ROBERT SNARRENBERG Upon the return to Et minor in bar 11, the mother quietly entreats her daughter to abandon her love. Brahms sets the dialogue with the same music, slightly adjusting the vocal line to accommodate differences in poetic rhythm. The daughter again responds by twisting her mother's words, telling her mother that grief takes time to pass and that the love her mother would have her abandon is an attachment whose beauty has yet to fade. After the daughter has her say, the piano again effects a return to Et minor. The mother, whose mounting impatience is underscored by the direction ancora piü mosso agitato, now demands that her daughter abandon her devotion. But troth ('Treue') is not merely a word, as the mother claims. On the contrary, it is a deeply powerful oath, a solemn pledge. It is not something one enters into lightly. And once plighted, it is not easily revoked. The daughter is right to insist that her mother demands the impossible. Brahms's setting of the daughter's third reply is a particularly sensitive reading, one which looks behind what she says to feelings not directly expressed in her final words. He clearly characterises her third response as different in tone from the first two: rather than dissolving into a dreamy, nebulous world, she responds defiantly. The bass line stays on the mother's cadential dominant as the daughter begins to sing; it is as if her mother were still palpably present, pressing for an answer. The daughter confronts her mother more directly by singing a version of her mother's song in the parallel key of El&gt; major. Her heightened feeling is evident in bars 27-28, when she alters her mother's song by stretching the interval of the rising motive to g^2 and then leaps not to f2 but even higher, to at2. With these dramatic leaps she stridently insists her troth is more unshakeable than the stony cliff. But how sure is she of this, how confident? The text betrays no uncertainty, yet Brahms's setting suggests otherwise. Despite the bluster of her Et major melody, the harmonic underpinning of the passage is indecisive, for it moves in a har monic circle from the dominant in bars 25-26 through I and II in bars 27-28 and back to the dominant in bar 29. So, rather than escaping into the unreality of her O major fantasy, she seems to come face to face with the reality that her mother would have her accept, a reality defined by Et minor. Having brought the daughter round to the dominant of Et upon her uttering the poem's final words, Brahms could have concluded the song with a brief postlude that reinforced the daughter's defiance. Instead, he has her repeat some of her last words and sets them in a manner that bespeaks an erosion of her defiance, even though this is not mandated by the text.4 A change in attitude has already been intimated in the fall from d2 in bar 27 to 62 in bar 28 and then to bt1 in bar 29 - just the opposite of the rising chromatic line that brought her previous statements to a close. The 62 in bar 28 is part of other reversals: the chord arpeggiated in bar 28 (at2-et2-ct2) is identical to the opening chord of the daughter's replies in bars 6 and 16, but now it returns to the Bt major harmony whence it originally arose, thus reversing the harmonic move that opened her initial protests (see Ex. Id). And the slow, deliberate steps of the melodic close © 2012 The Author.

This is clearly the crux of the song: the mother seems unable to sway her obdurate daughter, and the daughter seems unwilling to accede. With the song paused here on the dominant, we must wonder how it will turn out. The mother ended each of her pleas with an imperfect cadence, her melodic line ending on f1. Those imperfect cadences called forth the daughter's replies and at the same time defined the answer the mother desires: closure on el»1 (Ex. 3).Twice the daughter refuses to give the answer that her mother desires, and twice her utterances escape upwards in a stepwise ascent from B1. Her third reply, however, fails to escape the B1 that ties her to her mother. In bar 29, where the daughter is poised on the bt1, the pianist slows the pace and reduces the intensity, and the right hand slowly returns to its original register. Then, in bars 31-33, the daughter repeats her final words in a faltering rhythm; at last, as if resigned, she follows the basic line of her mother's pleas, ultimately resolving to et1. The piano's counterpoint produces effects that enact first uncertainty (underlying her defiance) and then a process of coming into agreement (with her mother).5 The right hand passes down in parallel sixths, with an inner voice in fourths and thirds, but the bass's counterpoint in this passage is unusual. Given the stream of parallel lines in the right hand, the bass, if it is to remain an independent line, must either rise or remain stationary on Bk Ex. 4a shows a conventional solution; Brahms, however, initially staggers the descending lines Ex. 3 'Liebestreu', the daughter's first three answers to the mother's pleas and the mother's ideal response $ the mother's pleas the daughter's first and second answers the daughter's third answer the mother's desired answer Ex. 4 'Liebestreu', bars 29-33 Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author.

The motivic friction between the lines is reminiscent of bars 2-5, and the counterpoint produces elusive harmonic effects. When the bass reaches Dl&gt; in bar 30, the harmonic fog momentarily clears. The counterpoint here produces the effect of a dominant in G&gt; major. The progres sion of the upper parts in bar 31 and the repetition of Dt in the bass prolong the effect of the dominant, as if the bass were waiting for the voice to cadence in Q&gt; major (Ex. 4b). But if c^-bt»1 sounds like 4-3 in Gl&gt; major (the initial tonicisation in her first two utterances), the reference is fleeting. The daughter repeats 'die hält', rather than finishing the line with 'ihn aus', and when the bass meets her at1 with the double-octave At, the prospect of a cadence in G&gt; major begins to evaporate. What emerges instead is the contrapuntal course desired by the mother (see again Ex. 3). The daughter repeats 'die hält' on at'-gl»1; these, too, sound like 4-3, but now in Et minor (Ex. 4c). The 4 chord supporting 3 at last gives way to a &lt;5 chord, and the singer and the pianist's right hand together complete the cadence in Et minor. The daughter's acquiescence is confirmed in the closing bars. For instance, the friction between rhythm and metre in the left hand is gradually eliminated; the left hand has continued to play the rising motive after the imperfect cadence in bar 29, but it sustains the long notes and omits the appoggiaturas, as if the turbulence were already beginning to dissipate. And then, in the final three bars, the pace of the waves slackens and the restless, once nervous pulsations of the right hand are quieted. The rising motive, which till now had always lasted two beats, is stretched to three beats in bars 33-34 and finally to six beats in bars 34-35 (composed decelerations would become a recurrent feature in Brahms's writing). In the final two instances, the long note at last falls on a downbeat. As the pace subsides, the pitch of the rising motive sinks lower and lower, and now the final statement, which is the lowest and slowest, begins in parallel with mother's initial plea - F-Gt - but it falls instead of rises, closing at last on the piano's lowest Et, as if the daughter has finally relinquished her attachment and sunk into the depths of grief. I have suggested that the daughter moves from defiance and uncertainty to agreement and resolution, but none of this is conveyed by the words that she speaks. What I have suggested is a reading of the poem that looks towards the daughter's experience following the conversation with her mother. I would also suggest that this flux of feelings belongs equally to the listener and performer, whose experience of counterpoint, harmony and rhythm in the closing passage progresses quite literally, I think, from a state of confused and conflicted feelings to one of resolution and closure. This is one way in which song can evoke a feeling of intimacy, as if we were privy to the inner life of the poetic persona. The intangibility of sound and the interiority of hearing also lend intensity to the experience of imaginative empathy. One could also understand the musical feelings as representing the daughter's non-verbal communication to her mother in the fictional world of the poem - as © 2012 The Author. Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Music Analysis, 31/i (2012)</page><page sequence="8">Brahms's Six Songs, Op. 3 enacting the manner in which the daughter speaks and the behaviour by which she communicates her emotional reality to her mother. After all, the flux of feeling is often, perhaps always, beyond what words alone can convey. The British psychoanalyst Christopher Bollas, who is accustomed by profession to inferring another's inner states from snatches of language and the minutiae of behaviour, writes the following: 'The terms we use for emotions - anxiety, depression, love, or hate - are desperately inadequate, but it is fitting that they should be so clumsy, because when we share an emotional reality, it is as if unconscious communication takes place by means of our separate senses, communication devoted to knowings derived from feelings.'6 The same, I think, can be said of music analysis: however apt the words we use to describe 'the music' we hear, they intimate but do not fully communicate experiences felt and shared. No. 2, 'Liebe und Frühling I' (August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben) In its artless simplicity, the unison texture that opens the second song offers a marked contrast to the rhythmic and motivic turbulence of 'Liebestreu'. The lines that create this texture begin to part company, however, in bar 5 (legato slurs in the piano highlight the staggered imitation in the two lines).7 As a result, differentiated segments of parallel sixths and tenths replace the uniform stream of parallel octaves. The left hand deviates slightly from strict imitation at the end of bar 6, mixing up the notes of bars 2-3. These alterations avert some awkward counterpoint while at the same time creating additional parallel motion and forestalling a change of harmony. Some deviation from the original melody would eventually become necessary in any case, since the second pair of lines in the poem, unlike the first, calls for a cadence, which would not be forthcom ing if the canonic lines strictly paralleled bars 1-4. As the lines branch out in bar 8, their tight imitative connection begins to deteriorate; instead, they thicken with internal references. The left hand's ascending fourth in bar 7 gives rise to sequences of ascending fourths in each hand, which are eventually obscured by the profusion of lines;8 and the chromatic motives in bars 9-11 are linked by a chain of falling fourths (Ex. 5). Individuation of the lines intensifies in the middle of bar 8, when the right hand and voice cease imitating the left hand. Then the lines begin to multiply: the single lines in the left and right hands Ex. 5 'Liebe und Frühling I', motivic fourths in bars —=-t' 117,1^1 \i —i P: i&gt;\% i.

Furthermore, as the song continues to unfold, strands of the opening motive are contrapuntally entwined in increasingly complex ways (Ex. 6): unison, imitation at the octave, contrary motion, contrary motion with doubling in thirds and two forms of contrary motion involving augmentation. The parallel lines, the imitation, the thickening of motivic reference, the increasing number of independent lines, the contrapuntal variations - all of these reflect the text: Wie sich Rebenranken schwingen in der linden Lüfte Hauch, wie sich weiße Winden schlingen luftig um den Rosenstrauch: Also schmiegen sich und ranken frühlingsselig, still und mild meine Tag- und Nachtgedanken um ein trautes liebes Bild. [As the vine's tendrils quiver in the waft of sweet breezes, as white morning-glories breezily wind about the rosebush: so my thoughts by day and night, spring-blessed, do quietly and gently nestle and twine about a trusted, beloved image.] The springtime profusion of morning glories' tendrils, growing, spreading and twining about a rosebush, becomes an elaborate simile for the teeming thoughts that fill the persona's days and nights. Repetitions of 'Wie sich', in the first half of the simile, create a state of expectancy and invite us to form an image of something that we will later use as a point of comparison, even though we cannot yet form an idea of the subject; in fact, the topic of the inverted simile is not mentioned until the very end of the poem. Lines three and four re-enact the © 2012 The Author.

We read the second half of the simile, as it were, between the lines of the first, hearing the terms of comparison resonate as the second half unfolds. In this sense, the reading of the poem's second half is denser than that of the first, thickened with memories of the first half and with the transformation of the first image into the second. This resonance also appears in the poem's construction. The fifth line, for example, rearranges elements of the first and third lines: 'schwingen' and 'schlingen' are echoed by 'schmiegen', and the noun 'Ranken' becomes a verb. I also hear an echo of 'Rebenranken' in 'Nachtgedanken'. Finally, the sound of 'um den Rosenstrauch' in the fourth line is echoed by 'um ein trautes' in the eighth. This play of association is also characteristic of a persona's reflections on the beloved, thoughts swarming around the image and the words of one thought reappearing in another. The play of association seen in the second half of the poem is likewise musically enacted. The upper line in bar 12 starts with an inversion of the original melody, passing down as the bass passes up; once together, they exchange Di and B. At the start of bar 13, the left hand's skip from d#1 down to b is answered by the upper line's skip from b1 up to dtt2, although now there is a subtle difference in the timing of the exchange. Starting on beat two, the upper line retraces its own stepwise descent from dl2 to at1. In the original version of the song, the vocal line of bars 12-13 simply replicated bars 1-2 (and 5-6). In the revised version, Brahms relieves the monotony of exact repetition and instead has the vocal line move in unison with the pianist's right hand. This revision also enhances the parallels with the text in bars 12-13, for now the singer, like the persona, rethinks and re-enacts old thoughts anew. The process of growth begins much sooner in the second half of the song. The offbeat notes form latent voices that quickly grow into four full-fledged lines at the end of the first phrase. The piano's lines begin to entangle the vocal line in bar 14: the inner line in the right hand embellishes the vocal line, and the topmost line moves in parallel thirds above it. And the texture thickens in a new way starting in bar 14: the left hand, which up to this point had been confined to the tenor register, moves into the bass register and then, in bar 16, doubles the line in the contrabass register, a doubling that persists for the remainder of the song. As in the first half, the parallel lines of the first phrase (bars 12-15) are repeated in somewhat altered form in the second phrase (bars 16-19).The bass line follows the same path at least as far as the penultimate EL But the similarities in the other lines are less exact. The vocal line in bar 16 starts out along the same path as bar 12, but a third higher; as it moves into bar 17 it steps down instead of up, and in so doing steps back into the line of bar 13.

The vocal line in bar 18 bears a closer resemblance to the first bar of the second phrase than to the corresponding bar in the first phrase (bar 14). The poem, on the face of it, seems to depict a state of blissful reverie, but Brahms's setting suggests additional nuances. The ending of the poem calls for a perfect cadence in bar 19, which the vocal line provides. Had the bass line cooperated, the phrase could have reached a perfect cadence (Ex. 7a). Instead, the bass line passes up by step, seemingly headed for an imperfect cadence like the one in bar 15 (Ex. 7b), but it halts on El when the vocal line comes to rest on b1 (Ex. 7c). Here, at the moment the persona at last mentions the object of her attention ('Bild'), the lines pause in a state of disharmony. I interpret the disruption of the cadence as a change in the persona's attitude, a sudden realisation that the mental image of the lover is not the real object of desire. The lines that nearly met on a cadential harmony retreat from one another as the dissonant chord melts into the dominant in bar 21. As the pulse slows, the persona grows pensive and begins to ruminate quietly during the sustained dominant, repeating the last two lines of the poem using the melody of bars 1-3, at first in simple augmentation, then more and more slowly and with increasing ornamentation (Ex. 8a), melting finally into a cadential progression that, unlike bar 19, coincides with a cadence. Meanwhile, the countermelody of bars 16-19 floats along in the right hand. The chromatic motives from bars 9-11 now appear in augmentation, chained together in similar fashion (Ex. 8b). Augmentation continues after the cadence in bar 28 as the right hand's semibreves sink chromatically above the left hand's crotchets. The left hand makes two attempts to start the melodic line of bar 1, only to fall back to B; it then limps downwards to close on the piano's lowest B. As in 'Liebestreu', Brahms's repetition and reinterpretation of the poem's closing lines suggest a reading of the poem that gives us a sense of what the persona might feel as he or she lapses into silent thought. If as listeners and performers we have a sequence of musical feelings like what I have described, I think we have an inner experience that, in the structure of its process, parallels an inner flux attributable to the persona, even though it goes beyond what the text itself explicitly describes.

But now, after thinking night and day about her lover, she desires to be with him and speak to him directly. She rouses herself and paces anxiously. She becomes impatient and dissatisfied with anything less than seeing the beloved himself.

I no longer want the wafting of breezes, no longer the rushing waves, I no longer want to listen for the flight of birds and for their songs. I want to go forth, I want to go to you, I want to say it to you myself: you are my Spring, you alone, for me in these bright days.] The poem obviously mandates an ABBA structure. The first and fourth stanzas are identical but for the substitution of 'Ich will' for 'Ich muß', which shifts the modality from external necessity to inner desire.10 The second and third stanzas, which are also parallel, offer a strong contrast. They are about memory, loss of desire and a failure to find pleasure. The mood of the inner stanzas seems fairly uniform on the face of it, but it is hard to imagine reciting the litany without intensification, although the form this takes in Brahms's setting is not perhaps what you might expect. 'I must ... , I must ... , / I must - there is no mistaking the urgency in the persona's voice. The music manifests the imperative mood. Like the three imperatives, the pairs of repeated fit's in bars 1-2 are insistent. And with the end of the previous song still lingering in our ears, the initiating fit1 feels like the fifth scale degree below the tonic, and so we already have a sense of the role it will play in the melodic syntax: we expect the melodic line to close a fourth higher. Therefore, in a purely melodic sense, this &amp; must be left. The line, like the persona, must go forth. The piano adds urgency (but not upward thrust) to this need by accelerating into a tremolo and adding dissonant notes beneath 81 - first el1 and then ei1. These dissonances create a need for further action (resolution) and thus coincide with the force of the verb. The vocal line sharpens this imperative by bringing a tritone into the outer voices in bar 2. But the descent of e1!1 to di1 in the middle of bar 3 does not bring resolution, for the afc creates another dissonance, which itself calls for further action, just as the repeated verb again calls for action. The dramatic increase in loudness, the rising scale, the quickening into quavers in bar 3 and the accented chromatic note all contribute to the sense of impatience, of determination welling up within, culminating in the explosive articulation of the word ('dir') which refers to the object of the lover's desire.11 The third imperative leads to a complete sentence, and Brahms tailors the musical syntax to fit, bringing the lines to rest, if only briefly, in a consonant triad at the end of bar 5. The imperfect cadence puts us in the appropriate mental state, for at this point we are wondering what it is the persona must say to the lover.

This has been an especially Brahmsian phrase in that it has the feeling of a phrase and cadence and all but lacks a B major triad that has the restful feel of a tonic. The overall harmonic progression is instead oriented around the dominant (see Ex. 9). Such a progression is particularly well suited for a person who is expressing a desire to be in a place that lies elsewhere and in the future. The consequent phrase (bars 6-10) unfolds along similar but not strictly parallel lines. Whereas the melody in the first phrase rose within the scale of B major, here the melody rises in the scale of E major (note the Ate) and descends, initially, in the scale of A major/F# minor (note the Dte). A flourish restores the melody to B major and extends the phrase into a fifth bar; this melodic bright ening is supported by the rising chromatic inflections in the piano in bars 8-9. Although the vocal line unfolds at the same pitch level as in the antecedent phrase, the bass is transposed down a fifth. This brings the bass line into harmony Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author. Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="15">16 ROBERT SNARRENBERG with the scales in the melody and also transforms the dominant orientation of the first phrase into a tonic one. Nevertheless, despite the altered counterpoint, the moment-by-moment harmonic process of the consequent phrase in many respects runs parallel to that of the antecedent: each begins with a dominant seventh chord, and then the expected resolution of this harmony itself becomes a dominant; in both cases, this new dominant (its leading quality intensified in the second phrase by chromatic inflections) resolves to VI, which then leads into the cadential progression. The pattern of cadences matches the syntax, marked by the colon and the period, and the chains of dominant seventh chords and suspensions, with their tendency towards resolution, match the future orienta tion and mood of the speaker. Like the first song of love and springtime, this one is in B major. This is also the triad to which the daughter gravitated in 'Liebestreu', enharmonically respelled as G major. I associate this key with her happiness in the company of her beloved - a time recalled in 'Liebestreu' and anticipated in the present song. This association is another reason for choosing to regard the persona in the songs of love and springtime as a woman. As noted earlier, the internal stanzas refer to familiar things that the persona no longer desires, things whose attractions pale in the bright light of the beloved. Accordingly, the bright B major triad is nowhere to be found in this part of the song. Instead, the music wanders from one tonicisation to another, and when B is touched upon as a tonic, it is in the minor mode. Despite the overall ABBA form, the second stanza begins like the first, with repeated fit's; the addition of gt1 inverts the fit1—e#1 of bar 1 and changes the mode from major to minor.12 The urgency of the first stanza is gone. Instead of rising quickly, the voice remains on low notes; when it does rise to e2 in the second bar, it immediately steps back down; and there is no acceleration into a tremolo in the piano. In the first stanza, the line closed with an emphatic rising semitone (e#2—fit2); here the line closes with a somewhat pathetic falling semitone (d2—ctt2) reminiscent of the cadential motives of bars 5 and 9-10. The inner stanzas refer to memories and things desired in the past, and Brahms fittingly sets the second half of each stanza with a musical reminiscence, an allusion to bars 16-17 of the first song of love and springtime. In both second halves we find the vocal line descending steadily in crotchets from fit2 to a#1, with an offbeat accompaniment pattern beneath it. The parallel thirds in the inner voice of the original version are given over to the bass in the recollected version.13 The evocation of the preceding song is, in musical terms, like the fragrance, sound and shadow mentioned in the poem: a trace of something else - the fragrance of a flower, the sound of something moving, the shadow cast by foliage, the absent lover. In fact, the passage recollected from the previous song is precisely where we learned that the twisting vines represent the persona's thoughts of the absent lover.14 I think it is fair to say that the persona becomes increasingly depressed.

The darkening of mood is enacted musically in several ways. Take, for example, the way the two phrases began in the first stanza and the beginnings of stanzas two and three. The depression is evident both in the increasingly smaller compass of the opening gestures - first a major third in bar 2 and a minor third in bar 6, then a minor second in bar 14 and finally just a single note in bar 22 - and in the prescribed manner of performance, from 'fast and furious' to 'sweetly and expressively' to 'very delicate and meditative'. The melodic pitches of the passages that begin with these gestures are shown in Ex. 10 in the form of scales ascending from fit1. Each passage begins on fit1, but the pitches above it become lower and lower. The persona's depression is manifested rhythmically as well. The melody of the third stanza runs virtually parallel to that of the second stanza, but it takes twice as long to sing the rising arpeggiation and falling cadence. And the final phrase, instead of descending to a cadential a1!1 on the third beat of bar 30, instead rises slowly through another arpeggiation (bt1—gl»2) and stops there, short of the cadential note (e!&gt;2). Nor is the rhythm of the ascent the steady rhythm of bars 22 and 25; instead it is syncopated, halting. In place of the word normally used for birdsong, Gesang, the speaker uses Lied, which is usually reserved for poetic song. The parapraxis reveals the real object of the persona's attention: the voice of the lover. Brahms enacts the parapraxis with a harmonic reinterpretation. The phrase pauses in bar 30 on an augmented sixth chord, holding it until it is robbed of its rhythmic and harmonic impulse towards the dominant of B!&gt; minor. The vocal line passes upwards by step, but not in the scale of the augmented sixth chord, as becomes clear in the leap from ó2 to gt2; instead, it takes over the upwardly impelled e"2 that had been in the piano and turns it into a descending passing Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author.

And then the line halts on that passing note, one step shy of resolving. The text here is 'lauschen': we and the persona 'listen intently', expectantly - waiting not simply for a resolution, but for the very harmony which earlier I associated with the beloved, B major. The desire of this dominant then carries us into the final stanza, in which the persona expresses the intention of fleeing to the lover with renewed and increased urgency: note the faster pace of the tremolos and, during the caden tial dominant in bars 41-42, the protracted dissonant ninth in the vocal line and the rising lines in the accompaniment. No. 4, 'Lied' (Friedrich Martin von Bodenstedt) The scene appears to be out-of-doors, but it is not the scene of two lovers meeting, and thus not the scene that might have fulfilled the longing articulated in the preceding song.

Open yourself, lay my stormy heart to rest! Heaven's blue cloth adorned with little stars, oh, dry the tears from my eyes! Heaven [help] the poor, long-suffering maid! My heart breaks from pain and sorrow!] In selecting this text from Bodenstedt's narrative poem Ivan, Brahms was undoubtedly attracted by elements that it shares with Reinick's 'Liebestreu'. That the two songs were paired in Brahms's mind is supported by the fact that they were paginated consecutively in the engraver's original model for the opus.15 Ivan is a series of nineteen poems published in 1842 as part of Bodenstedt's Poetische Farbenskizze von Rußland,}6 Rather than simply selecting one of the poems from the collection, however, Brahms cobbled together a text by taking the eighth poem and appending to it the opening strophe of the ninth. This is not as capricious as it might sound. Like the two stanzas of the eighth poem, the opening strophe of the ninth consists of three couplets. Moreover, the themes of the poems are intimately related. The eighth poem presents metaphors for a situation that is revealed in the ninth poem. And that situation, we will see, is the point of connection with the scene of'Liebestreu'. In the opening poem of Bodenstedt's sequence, we are introduced to the local lord, a count by the name of Büstrov. Upon returning from a long journey, the count throws a banquet and regales the guests with tales of his sexual exploits. One of his friends then challenges him to woo the fairest woman here at home, a peasant girl named Masha, the bride-to-be of Ivan Paulitsch, son of the local elder. The next three poems depict village life. In the fifth poem, the count and his guests walk about in the garden and grove and then make their way to the bank of a stream where the village girls are dancing. In a whisper, one of the guests points out Masha to the count. She blushes when she notices his gaze. As she dances on, she recognises him as one who had been cordial to her as a child and whose departure on his journey had pained her. In fact, it seems that the count had once treated Masha almost as if she were his own daughter. She used to bring flowers to his room and spend mornings with him, and he let her ride with him upon his horse. After all these years, she wonders, does he still remember her? He does, and when he speaks to her, her heart wells up within her as she thinks fondly of her childhood. As the count takes his leave, he reaches out to kiss her hand and implores her to bring him flowers each morning. The sixth poem describes another evening, probably some weeks later, when the count again goes to the streamside, not to see the dancing maidens, but to seek out Masha. But she no longer goes to the evening dances. Instead, she tends to the neighbour's children and helps their mother with the chores. She is no longer seen in the village. Masha goes about her tasks cheerlessly; at night she sits by the window, singing softly while she stares into the distance: 'But I must stay, I can't go on ... . I sit at night in my room, sad and lonely'. In the seventh poem we find Ivan pacing about his room. 'I still can't believe it', he says. 'She trembled Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author. Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="19">20 ROBERT SNARRENBERG when I clasped her hands, she sobbed and sank onto the bed, spent - and on her table lay a jewel and a watch with a gold chain. I questioned her - she looks at me and doesn't know how to extricate herself. What's that devil done to her? O Ivan, you serf! you poor man! And you have to find your maiden thus!' By the time we reach the eighth poem, then, we know that the count has assaulted Masha, that she is the prey beside the stream and he, the high and mighty count, the predator. Most of the poems in Bodenstedt's sequence are spoken by an omniscient narrator. Some are set pieces in which the narrator gives us information about a character or situation, while others describe scenes and events or relate spoken dialogue. The eighth poem is spoken entirely by the narrator. It conjures up a scene of danger, but in the tone of a removed observer who speaks allegorically about the story he is telling. The ninth poem, by contrast, is a dialogue between Masha and her mother about what has befallen her and what is to become of her. The scene is thus remarkably similar to that of'Liebestreu'. When Brahms adds the opening of Masha's dialogue to Bodenstedt's eighth poem, he removes the quotation marks, putting all three stanzas into the mouth of one persona, the T of the third stanza.17 Brahms further underscores the singularity of the poetic voice by using the same music for all three stanzas. Placing the eighth poem in the voice of Masha rather than that of a narrator changes the way we interpret the setting. Rather than seeing the woman's plight from two different points of view (her own and that of the narrator), we see different perils from a single point of view. At first she describes threats to others (the bird and the fish), but then her attention turns inward, and she voices feelings about her own plight. She becomes introspective. When she was still a child, suffering may have seemed remote, something that befell others - after all, she was favoured by the count as a child, she became the fairest of her village and she was betrothed to its leading son - but all that has changed: suffering is now something that has befallen her. Three progressions, from far to near, parallel the inward turn of the poem. The first and most obvious progression is that of predators approaching their prey from far away and high above. The sequence of the narrative representation parallels their approach: Masha begins with what a person can see only from far away - birds in flight - and then moves to what one must be nearer to see: a white dove in the green grass, a small fish beneath the water's surface and finally the ground beneath her feet. The settings also progress from distant to immediate: from an indeterminate location in the first stanza to a scene on the Volga and finally to the place where she stands. Another progression is encoded in the verb tenses. She begins the poem by describing a scene from the past when the vulture flew and the dove sat, but then she addresses the dove in the present tense. She describes a similar scene in the second stanza using the present tense exclusively. Present-tense description then gives way to several in-the-moment imperatives in the third stanza that express her desire for consolation in the future. The third progression moves from the external space of nature to her inner personal space. © 2012 The Author. Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Music Analysis, 31/i (2012)</page><page sequence="20">Brahms's Six Songs, Op. 3 Ex. 11 Melodic similarities between the opening phrases of 'Liebestreu' (bars 2-5) and 'Lied' (bars 1-4) After describing a world that belongs to other creatures in the first and second stanzas, she addresses a world that belongs to her: first the external world of earth and heaven, then her body and finally the internal world of her heart. The progression from the natural to the personal is also encoded in anthropomorphic language in the final lines of both the first and second stanzas. The vulture is said to be 'lascivious' or 'lecherous', and the fate the fish fears is not that of being devoured, but that of being led to the 'grave'. These are parapraxes in which the woman substitutes expressions that describe her own predator and her own fate.18 These doubled meanings are musically enacted by motivic repetitions at the end of each stanza, one uttered by the singer and two others played by the pianist, as if the woman has fallen silent and is turning the final thought over in her mind. The progression towards interiority, a characteristic theme of Romanticism, is evident in the other songs of Op. 3. We saw an inward turn in the first song, when the daughter repeated her final words in a way that suggested a change of attitude, and also in the second song, when the persona repeated the final lines in a manner that suggested sinking into contemplative reverie. The third song was a meditation on inner impulses, desires and necessities. The fifth song will be a young woman's rumination on loneliness, and the sixth song will, among other things, report a young woman's dreams. In addition to thematic connections with the text of 'Liebestreu' (a suffering daughter who turns to her mother and a progression towards interiority), struc tural parallels connect the two texts. Each has three stanzas, and each stanza is divided between two characters: mother and daughter in 'Liebestreu', predator and prey in Bodenstedt's 'Lied'. These shared elements, I believe, account for Brahms's decision to compose a setting that evokes memories of'Liebestreu'.19 The fact that both songs are in the key of Et minor is just the beginning. Each setting is strophic, and in each case Brahms repeats words at the end of the third stanza and recomposes its ending. There are striking musical parallels between the corresponding parts of the two settings. The contour of the first couplet, for example, resembles the contour of the mother's part in 'Liebestreu' (Ex. 11): Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author. Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="21">ROBERT SNARRENBERG Ex. 12 'Lied', bars 1-4 normal cadence rising early on to gt&gt;2, falling to d&gt;2 (with the same motive, no less) and then undulating by means of a motive and its inversion. The C\&gt; major triad is also projected in the interior of the passages just mentioned (strengthened in 'Lied' by motives that traverse spans bounded by O and G&gt;, frequently doubled in thirds). The settings of couplets two and three (bars 5-13) clearly resemble the daughter's responses in the first two stanzas of'Liebestreu': The initial portion of bars 5-9, for example, moves within a tonicised O major triad. The accompa niment also lies in a relatively high register, and the lowest line again doubles the vocal line. Finally, there are rising chromatic lines in both the voice and the top line of the accompaniment. Just as the reader's gaze is immediately drawn skywards by the words of the opening couplet ('Weit' in the first stanza and 'hoch' in the second), the listener's attention is drawn upwards by the sweeping arpeggiations. From there the vocal line gradually descends. But unlike the first couplet in 'Liebestreu', which ended with a clear imperfect cadence befitting the imperative mood of the mother's statement, Brahms here crafts counterpoint that suggests, yet avoids, a perfect cadence in bar 4; this is appropriate, for the scene is only partly set by the description of the predatory bird (Ex. 12). The bass line of the couplet creates a plagal close and features a motive that will figure prominently later in the stanza (Ex. 12). The second couplet (bars 5-9) completes the description of the scene; it ends with an imperfect cadence in bar 9. This accords with the imperative felt by the woman, who, seeing the predator and its prey, feels compelled to warn the endangered creature. That the couplet returns to Et minor rather than escaping into O major is consistent with the single point of view in this poem. The third couplet (bars 9-13) continues the texture of the second but shifts to the major mode, in keeping with the positive tone of the sentence's main clause. It tonicises El&gt; major using a transposition of the two-bar pattern that tonicised Q&gt; major in bars 5-6.The bass motive heard in the first couplet, now prefixed by B!&gt;, becomes the motive of the melodic cadence and the brief postlude. The two lines of the third couplet are set in nearly identical fashion, but a significant alteration in the cadential motive inscribes the warning: in bars 10—11, a major-mode version of the motive sets the mention of the dove's protector, the green foliage; in bars 12-13, a minor-mode version (repeated in the postlude) sets the mention of its predator, the ravenous vulture. (In both attempts at effecting a cadence, the © 2012 The Author.

A two-beat bar then realigns the notation with the perceived metre, which was shifted by a half bar when the piano occluded the cadence in bar 4 (the upward arpeggiation on beat three parallels the arpeggiation heard on the first beat of bar 1); a bar of 3/2 at the end of the song fulfils a similar function. The composed ritardando in bar 16 stretches the motive so that it now concludes on a downbeat. This rhythmic cadence compensates for the lack of a clear harmonic cadence. Brahms uses the same music for stanzas two and three, albeit with some dramatic modifications at the end of the third. The repetition underscores the woman's identification with the vulnerability of the dove and fish. The end of the third stanza, predictably, shares significant features with the daughter's third rejoinder in 'Liebestreu'. Her agitation increases, and finally her composure cracks when she speaks of her heartbreak. In fact, upon mentioning the breaking of her heart, she breaks off the musical phrase and the poetic line. Rather than continuing to the cadential motive, she repeats 'es bricht mir das Herz'. Nor does she relax into the cadence; instead, her fervour intensifies as her line rises chromatically to a fortissimo gl-2, situated not in a tonic chord but in an aug mented sixth chord. And when this resolves to a cadential I chord in bar 45, the vocal line abruptly breaks from the minor mode by leaping to g*l2. (The modal reversal is reminiscent of bars 26-27 of 'Liebestreu', where the daughter began her most defiant reply with a similar substitution of gt2 for gt2.) The distress of her pain and sorrow is enacted by two more wrenching modal conflicts: the chromatic descent from gí (an inversion of the chromatic motives that led to f2 and g!&gt;2 in bars 43-45) and then the friction between O and öl in bar 47. Compared to the gradual stepwise descent in 'Liebestreu', which seemed indicative of a healthy acceptance of grief that might lead beyond suffering, the gestures that close this song seem to indicate an enduring and unresolved state of inner anguish. No. 5, 'In der Fremde' (Joseph von Eichendorfi) The poem appears in Eichendorffs novella Viel Lärmen um Nichts.20 The scene is twilight in a spacious dining room: a man eating at a large table, a dozing harpist and, sitting in a window seat, a beautiful young woman who looks out upon a twilight scene illuminated by flashes of lightning. Guitar in hand, she sings: Aus der Heimat hinter den Blitzen rot, da kommen die Wolken her. Aber Vater und Mutter sind lange tot, es kennt mich dort keiner mehr. Wie bald, [ach] wie bald kommt die stille Zeit, da ruhe ich auch und über mir rauscht die schöne Waldeinsamkeit, und keiner kennt mich mehr hier. Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author.

But Father and Mother are long dead, no one there knows me anymore. How quickly, oh, how quickly the peaceful time comes, when I too shall rest, and above me the lovely loneliness of the forest shall rustle, and no one here will know me anymore.] Her thoughts flow in a chain of free associations. The lightning attracts her attention, and she sees clouds approaching. Looking in the direction of their movement, she locates the place on the horizon from which the clouds appear to emanate. And this, she notices, is where her homeland lies. Looking inwardly towards that original home, she thinks of those who created it: her father and mother. But they are long dead, and others who knew her then are no longer there. That was there and then: home is now a place of memory, one she no longer inhabits. Were she a wife or mother, she might have thought of a home she herself had made as that place where she finds rest. But she thinks instead of death and loneliness, a place of rest that is yet to be and a time, approaching as surely as the clouds, when even here no one will know her. She finds herself between those places where one is held unconditionally, between cradle and grave, just as she finds herself in a physical space, the window niche, poised between inner and outer worlds, between shelter and storm. Brahms enacts the scene: first the closely voiced stile brisé of the guitar, creating the sense of tonic without providing the stability of a tonic \ chord; and then the lightning flash of a descending arpeggiation, arresting because of its unprepared and unresolved dissonances (7), the poco ritardando and the slight surge in dynamics. The rhythmic cadence on the dominant leaves us poised in a state of longing, for home, for the harmony of the tonic triad. The introductory phrase is replete with associations that will freely multiply as the song unfolds. The line of thought I want to follow here is the two-bar gesture shown in Ex. 13a. The upbeat to bar 3 sounds very much like a transposition of this gesture (Ex. 13b), but the elements are somewhat reconfigured. Both forms begin with an upbeat anticipation (a) and then move down a semitone. The first accelerates and rises stepwise (¿); the second likewise accelerates, but rises upwards in steps of a third (b'). Both gestures then fall a third (c). The first gesture concludes with three notes descending by step; the second also ends with a three-note descent (d), but as in the earlier rise the steps have become thirds 0d'). The two gestures are rhythmically parallel through the downbeat of the second bar (&lt;?). Form A is accompanied in the tenor register in parallel sixths; form B is accompanied in parallel tenths.

As in the piano's introduction, the second gesture of the phrase begins a third higher than the first. Like form B, it is two beats shorter than form A. This abbrevia tion accommodates the rhythm of the poem's second line, which is one foot shorter than the first; the rhythmic caesura created by the abbreviation matches the grammatical resting point. Because the two notes in motive c can be resolved by the tonic triad pitch that lies between them, I hear the new cadential motive/as an elided form of c and d (see again Ex. 13c). In hewing more closely to form A, form C departs from the expected repetition of form B. Yet, because of its higher register, form C presents the climactic pitches of form B, d2-b', in precisely the same location. Now, however, they actually close on ctt2, supported by a tonicised A major harmony; the closure suits the declarative mood of the text. Resolution, however, is short-lived. Whereas in bar 4 the accompaniment had sustained the cadential git1, here in bar 8 the accompaniment immediately echoes the vocal cadence and arrests the rhythmic closure of the vocal line; syncopation of the accented dissonances (7) heightens the arresting effect, for these are the same pitches that attracted our attention in bars 3-4: d2, b1 and gf.The piano's syncopation sounds to me like a sob or a sudden intake of breath, as if the woman suddenly feels the emotional impact of the association she is about to name. Brahms repeats the syncopation with the first word of the next line, the arresting conjunction 'aber'. Although the semantic contrast is not explicit, I take it to be a contrast between the virtual presence of her parents in her thoughts of home and their actual absence in death. Thoughts of home brightened her mood, but thoughts of her dead parents return her to the darker mode of F# minor; the A major triad dissolves into ctt1 and a1 in bar 9, and these pitches are returned to Ff minor in bar 10. The next phrase (bars 10-16) begins like the last, with the same transposition of form A, but the second gesture in the phrase once again deviates from earlier patterns. The second gesture begins on ctt2, as if it were about to re-enact form C (Ex. 13d). But instead of directly anticipating the pitch on the downbeat of bar 12, the line turns ctt2 into a harmonic anticipation and transposes the remainder of the gesture upwards to S2, yet another position within the F# minor triad. After the singer entered in bar 5, Brahms treated the main melodic pitch of each two-bar unit as if it were 3; hence we found ourselves in Ff minor in bar 5, in A major in bar 7 and in D major here in bar 12. The change of tonal focus was quite smooth in bars 5-8, because the vocal line was ambiguous with respect to the scales of Ff minor and A major. The change of tonal focus in bars 9-12, however, is more pronounced, because gt2 and the behaviour of el2 contradict the scale of F# minor. This abandonment of Ff minor and the combination of a crescendo and a rise in register reflect the heightened intensity of the woman's emotions. The vocal cadence is again interrupted, but here the woman sings along with the syncopated rhythm, repeating her last line sotto voce, trailing off as one might ©2012 The Author.

After a second, quieter sob (bars 14-15), the D major harmony dissolves into fit1 and a1. The tempo slows. It is as if the woman sinks once again into the silence of depression, silently returning fit1 and a1 to Fi minor. The second stanza begins in the same way as the first. But the latter part of its first phrase is not quite what we have learned to expect. The deviation has its origins in the peculiarity of EichendorfFs text. The rhythm of the first stanza (prepared by the piano's introduction) was four stresses in the first line and three in the next, with each pair of lines constituting a complete sentence. Eichendorff breaks this rhythm in the second stanza by adding a fourth stress to the second line and delaying grammatical closure until the third line. Using form C to set the second line would have placed a cadence in the middle of a word that lies in the middle of a prepositional phrase. A cadence would also be out of place at the end of the lengthened line, so Brahms recomposes the music of the first stanza to suit both the lengthened line and the enjambment.21 Form A, transposed, suffices for the lengthened line (Ex. 14), and in fact the accompaniment enacts form A exactly. The singer's sustained e2 is a lengthened version of the crotchet e2 in form A, and because it also comes in place of and higher than the expected c#2 of form C, it instantiates what is expressed by 'über'. Beneath the stillness of the sustained e2, the piano rushes on. As in bar 8, the piano's gripping syncopation follows hard on the heels of its would-be Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author. Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="27">28 ROBERT SNARRENBERG cadence. Brahms initiates the third line of the stanza in the upbeat to bar 22, even though it begins with a stressed syllable. This rhythmic shift eliminates the caesura which would have resulted had the fourth beat been left empty and creates an unbroken stream of sound which enacts the poem's enjambment.The postponed grammatical close at the end of third line occurs in bars 23-24 in the middle of the musical phrase; a poco rit. helps create the semblance of a cadence. The effect is strengthened by the piano's interruption, which is modelled on bars 20-21. The voice begins the fourth line of the stanza with a modification of form D. Instead of producing a change of triad, as they had in bar 12, the accompanying lines sustain the Fit major triad. The gt2 and the behaviour of e2 again contradict the scale of Ff minor, but rather than tonicising the sustained triad, they make it sound like a dominant. The brief semblance of B minor alludes, I think, to the tonicisations of B (G) heard in each of the previous songs. The allusion suggests to me that the woman still longs for that moment with her beloved, a moment that, if it ever was, is now as lost as are her parents and her home. The tessitura and the accompaniment texture also recall the wistful moment of recollection in 'Liebe und Frühling II' (bars 17-18). The minor ninth created by gN2 is an interval associated with form B. As if that association had been triggered, the line abandons form D and imitates the descending arpeggiation of form B and the arrested imperfect cadence of bars 3-4. The octave and sixth of the B minor arpeggiation in bars 26-27, in the rhythm of the sobbing syncopation, resolve the dissonant ninth and seventh of bar 25; and in the syncopated echo of form C in bars 27-28, d2 and b1 of that arpeggiation are brought to rest on c#2. Since forms D and C, which were originally situated in non-tonic keys as elaborations of 3, now survive as remnants within an Fit harmony (elaborating 8 and 5), one might expect to feel resolution, as if these thoughts returned home to the original tonic. But rest is elusive. Rather, repeated disturbances are symptomatic of the emotions aroused by the woman's free associations. When ever the melodic line seems to find a moment of repose, it is nearly always disturbed: in bar 8, by the syncopations on the second beat and the displacement of cit2 by d2; in bar 13, by similar syncopations; in bar 21, by the suspension of e2; in bar 23, by the syncopated chord on beat four, which displaces a1 with a#1; and in bar 26, by the abbreviation of ctt2. Nor does the vocal line ever come to rest on the pitch that has a sense of home, i1. At the two points of undisturbed rest - the end of the first stanza in bar 15 and the close of the second in bar 28 - the melodic line halts on the fifth of the cadential tonic. The closing passage is unsettled in other respects. Although it unfolds over a sustained tonic bass pitch, the harmonic effect fluctuates: it began as a quasi cadential minor-mode tonic in bar 23, then mutated into a major-mode tonic going into bar 24 and became a minor-mode dominant in bar 25; the Gfs in bar 27 return it to the scale of Fit minor, but the final chord in bar 28 retains the raised third. © 2012 The Author.

In Brahms's setting, she repeats the final words of each stanza, as if dwelling upon the devastating thought that she is a stranger in her native land and in this foreign country, that she lacks the comfort and security of being known by others. No. 6, 'Lied' (Eichendorff) This song also appears in Viel Lärmen um Nichts. As a prince and his companions saunter through the palace woods enjoying the first warmth of the morning sun, a beautiful song suddenly rings out across the forest. It is a maiden disguised as a young huntsman named Florentin. She sings three stanzas before joining the group below but soon rushes away. She is seen again upon the cliffs, whence she sings the final stanza of her song. Lindes Rauschen in den Wipfeln, Vöglein, die ihr fernab fliegt, Bronnen von den stillen Gipfeln, sagt, wo meine Heimat liegt? Heut im Traum sah ich sie wieder, und von allen Bergen ging solches Grüßen zu mir nieder, daß ich an zu weinen fing.

Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="29">30 ROBERT SNARRENBERG The young woman is travelling in an alien land, far from her birthplace, far from the source of her life. Thoughts of home well up within her like the waters that stream from unseen sources high in the mountains. Associations - 'people, springs, crag and tree' - flitter through her mind like the little birds in the distance, as if conjured from airy nothing by the unseen wind that rustles the treetops of the palace woods. Given the juxtaposition with the previous poem, one can imagine that the recollections of home awakened by the evening storm filtered into her dreams.22 And now, the following morning, the recollections linger in her mind. In her dream she receives a greeting from all the mountains, but here, in reality, on these foreign mountains, it is unlikely that she would be so hailed: in the light of early morn, the mountain peaks are silent (note the parallelism of 'von den stillen Gipfeln' and 'von allen Bergen'). And the question she poses at the end of the first stanza implies that she herself is unsure of her place. We know from 'In der Fremde' that she is a stranger in her homeland. Her parents are dead, and no one there would recognise her. Like Florentin, she is incognito. Instead of highlighting the dream mentioned at the beginning of the second stanza, Brahms isolates the third stanza, where the woman confronts her place in the here and now. The exclamation 'Ach' at the beginning of the stanza could express a despondency that arises from feeling alone in the world. But it could also express a decision to relinquish her attachments to the things she is about to mention. Brahms omits the third line of this stanza, which would have drawn the listener's attention once again to the rustling treetops in the palace woods.23 Without that direct reference, it is more difficult to tell whether the things mentioned in the second line refer to what she sees around her, what she saw in her dream or what she recollects of her homeland. The fourth line embraces all of these things. It is difficult to say what it means for everything to seem like a dream to her or what feelings this arouses. But there are reasons to think that, in Brahms's reading, the declaration is a sign of healthy accommodation to her present circumstances, whatever they may be. Brahms's setting fits the images of the first stanza. The song begins with a rustling tremolo in the accompaniment and a restless vocal line that repeatedly presses upwards through an accented chromatic passing note. The nervousness is reminiscent of the opening lines of the two 'Liebe und Frühling' songs, but particularly the first, in which the quivering of the vines in the gentle breeze ('in der linden Lüfte Hauch'), like the rustling in the treetops ('lindes Rauschen'), was a metaphor for her agitation, and the vocal line culminated with an accented chromatic passing note. The tremolo also enacts the fluttering of the little birds. The rising vocal line, accompanied initially by a parallel rise in the bass, reflects the woman's attention, which rises from the treetops to the sky beyond and thence to the mountaintops. The vocal line also reflects the inner surge of emotion, which culminates in a plea bespeaking the loss of her home. Brahms captures this sense of loss in bars 7-8 by moving to the flat side, first by lowering the rising chromatic motive of bars 2, 3 and 6 so that the accented passing note © 2012 The Author.

Ironically, at the very moment she utters the word 'Heimat', we reach the chord in this phrase that lies farthest from the home key of A major. Brahms sets the conclusion of the stanza in such a way as to suggest that the heaven she seeks is not within her grasp. Rather than falling to a dominant-triad pitch on the downbeat of bar 9, rhyming with the cadence in bar 5 (Ex. 15a), the line ends on cf. This returns us to the major mode but leaves the vocal line (and the tenor line) in a state of non-resolution. The second attempt at cadential resolution produces confusion and then greater uncertainty. The tenor and vocal lines seem at first to swerve again to the flat side on the downbeat of bar 10, only to interpret the dissonances not as $ and bk1, but as accented ascending chromatic notes that resolve on beat two. The lines leading into bar 11 could have reached a satisfying close (Ex. 15b), but instead they end in a more highly charged state of non-resolution, poised on the chromatic notes that we expected to resolve upwards to the fifth and third of the cadential dominant, in parallel with the lines of bar 10. Brahms extends the duration of the chromatic notes into the second beat, and then the time span of the phrase expires without the anticipated resolution. The anacrusis to the second stanza provides the antici pated pitches but not resolution. There is a pitch class that cannot be named, one that to my mind is emblem atic of the woman's plight. It is a vagrant that awakened unfulfilled desires at the end of the previous song and harked back to the tonalities of O (B) major and B minor, which figured prominently in the first four songs. Here it has two guises, but in neither guise is it at home in the world of A major. In the tenor line of bar 8, it behaves as H, an upper neighbour to a; but in the very next bar, in the same line, it behaves as a# and passes upwards to b. It is the pitch upon which the vocal line ends but does not rest in bar 11. In bar 21, the pitch seems poised once again to lead upwards, but it leads neither up nor down when the third stanza begins. Instead, the vocal line resumes the pitch at the end of bar 21 while the bass descends towards 1)3 in bar 22. While it may seem for a while as if the vocal line sustains an augmented sixth, that implication recedes with the progression to F major in bar 25. Indeed, with the cooperation of the accompaniment, the pitch takes on the guise of bt1 and joins the strange and ephemeral world of F major.24 Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author. Music Analysis © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="31">32 ROBERT SNARRENBERG Like the young woman disguised as Florentin, who momentarily joins the prince's retinue at this point, the vocal line here assumes the disguise of F major; her huntsman's disguise is also underscored by the evocation of bugle calls. Then, declaring that everything about her is unreal, she retreats into A minor and pauses on a dominant. Rather than pining for greetings that she does not receive, she leaves it to others to send greetings on her behalf. In my view, the woman has finally made her peace with the world. I take this to be Brahms's reading, too, for all hints of chromatic depression are avoided in the fourth stanza. The lines rise exuberantly, and the setting also avoids the equivocations of the earlier stanzas: there is no vacillation between major and minor modes, and the vagrant pitch that wavered in identity appears here but once, in the tenor line of bar 39, in exactly the same position as in bars 8 and 18, but now as alt, not bk Instead of the depression to d? expected in bar 38, the line ascends to an upwardly impelled chromatic note, dtt2, and continues to rise chromatically, culminating on fí2 in bar 39 (already anticipated by the piano in bar 37). The vocal lines of every song in the opus have culminated on this pitch. In the first song, it was the pitch on which both mother and daughter mentioned her suffering. In the second song, the opening line pressed anxiously upwards to this pitch. In the third song, it was the culminating pitch of the lines that expressed her desire to see and speak to her beloved. In the fourth song, it appeared at the culmination of the third stanza, where she mentioned her broken heart. And in the fifth song, it appeared in each stanza at the point where she stated that no one knew her, neither in the place she called home nor in her present circumstances. Here in the sixth song, it appears again at the mention of her home. But unlike the other songs, in which g|.2/ö2 belonged to the tonic triad, here it is out of place. And here she abandons fit2, leaving it to an inner voice in the piano to resolve upwards through gf1 to a1, and descends instead to a perfect close in bar 41, after which she follows along as the piano echoes the cadence in a lower register. The confidence of this cadence appears in marked contrast to the equivocal cadences of the previous two songs and offers a further reason for thinking that the woman may have at last come to terms with her sorrow. Some Final Thoughts on Narrative and Empathy Given the abundance of textual and tonal connections, it seems plausible to think of the opus in terms of a narrative; narrative is, after all, one of the ways in which we try to make sense of the events in our lives.25 This can be done in a number of ways. The two songs of love and springtime could be taken as representing events that took place while the woman was happily betrothed (or as recollections of that time), dividing the opus into three pairs of songs that represent three separate times in her life: (1) love and spring in songs two and three, (2) subsequent pain and suffering in songs one and four and (3) loneliness and wandering in songs five and six.

But given the original narrative context of the fourth song, in which the count's assault shattered her betrothal, it makes sense to read the opus as a chronological sequence in the order in which the songs are presented. The first four songs take place in the privacy of the woman's home, in the immediate aftermath of the appalling, tragic event. When her mother learns of it, she urges her daughter to break off the betrothal. The daughter, pondering her mother's advice, thinks about her trusted lover and then decides she must go to him herself, to tell him what has happened and to assure him that she loves only him. The fourth song is a reflection on the seriousness of her plight, perhaps in her mother's presence. The window niche of the fifth song provides a transition from the intimate setting of her parents' home to the outdoor scene of the final song. The strong parallels between songs one and four and the pairings that follow each of them also suggest a division into two groups: a dialogue and two songs about wondering how to proceed, followed by a monologue and two songs about wandering in distant places. Brahms seems drawn to poems that express an emotional or psychological flux, perhaps an intensification of a desire or a moment of realisation. This is why, I think, strictly strophic settings are relatively rare in his settings of lyric poetry. Repetition of a strophe, after all, tends to fix the emotion of the moment; it is less apt to reflect fluctuations of mind and feeling. I find that Brahms crafts musical experiences which are attuned to these sorts of fluctuations in the interior life of the poetic persona. In music we experience fine shades of movement and impediment, desire and closure, friction and disappointment, congruence and satisfaction. Language may refer to such things, but music gets us involved in the processes themselves. Musical activity also involves us in a process of attunement or empathy. When we make music, and even when we listen to it, the rhythmic and emotional regions of our brains are actively engaged in ways that parallel and respond to the rhythms of the sounds. And when musical sound emanates from a voice, from within a body, from behaviours that can be heard but not seen, the attunement feels acutely intimate, for it is rooted in our first experiences of empathy, in infancy, when we become accustomed to mirroring in our move ments the sounds of our mother's voice. Solo song is thus capable of offering a particularly intimate form of imaginative, empathic access to the fluctuating emotional life of a poetic persona. And close reading of the musicopoetic ele ments can in turn lead to a keener awareness of what we feel as we listen to, perform and ponder the songs we love. NOTES 1.

On the poem, see also Thomas Sick,' "Unsere Liebe muß ewig bestehn!" Liebestreue in Brahms' Liedschaffen', in Peter Jost (ed.), Brahms als Liedkomponist: Studien zum Verhältnis von Text und Vertonung (Stuttgart: Steiner, 1992), pp. 174-8; and Heike Benecke, 'Mutter-Tochter Dialoge', in Jost, Brahms als Liedkomponist, pp. 143-5. 4. As Sick writes, it is 'as if Brahms wanted to leave doubt in the end about the girl's certainty' ('als ob Brahms die Sicherheit des Mädchens letztlich doch in Frage stellen wurde', p. 178; translation mine). Malin (pp. 157-8) describes many of the uncertain rhythmic and harmonic effects in the denouement, but he stops short of saying how these effects relate to the confrontation between daughter and mother. 5. To focus attention on process and invite an active mode of cognition, I often use the verb 'enact'. The agent of this verb is indeterminate: we might say that Brahms enacts a particular process in the act of composing, that the performer enacts the process, that the music as heard enacts the process or that I enact this process in the act of listening. 6. See Christopher Bollas, Cracking Up: the Work of Unconscious Experience (New York: Hill and Wang, 1995), p. 29. 7. My analysis is based on the second edition of the song, which contains many significant revisions, including the addition of two legato slurs in the left hand in bars 5-8. 8. The rising leap of a fourth abbreviates the rising stepwise fourth in bars 2-3. It is also worth noting that there are fewer rising fourths in Brahms's original version of this song. 9. Brahms selected the two poems of love and springtime from Hoffmann von Fall ersleben^ Liebe und Frühling, a lyric cycle of seven poems in the voice of a youth. In the opening poem, the youth expresses the hope that the new spring will bring true love. As the cycle progresses, the youth speaks of meeting someone and falling head over heels in love. 'Wie sich Rebenranken schwingen' is the fifth poem in the sequence. In the sixth, the persona contemplates what to say to the beloved: 'But how shall I respond to you [and say] what you are to me? I know I cannot thank you in songs. The songs that I could sing are no longer mine: the heart from which they brightly sound is already yours!' In the seventh poem, 'Ich muß hinaus, ich muß zu dir', the youth expresses the intention to confess his or her love.The cycle uses only first- and second-person pronouns, and there is no direct indication of the gender of either the speaker or the beloved, but in Op. 3 the two poems are surrounded by © 2012 The Author.

Ira Lincoln Braus provides a detailed analysis of the poem's rhetorical aspects and correlates these with motivic and tonal processes in Ch. 8 of 'Textual Rhetoric and Harmonic Anomaly in Selected Lieder of Johannes Brahms' (PhD diss., Harvard University, 1988). 11. Braus (pp. 96-7) notes the chiastic shift from 'ich' and 'dir' in the first couplet to 'du' and 'mir' in the second. 12. Braus (pp. 100-23) reads this inversion as a rotation of accessory tones around fit1 and traces other manifestations of this motive in the song. 13. I also hear in the arpeggiations and descents of bars 14 and 16 an echo of bars 14-15 in the previous song. 14. The second stanza begins with a mention of roses, in itself reminiscent of the preceding poem, in which the rosebush represented the image that she contem plated while reminiscing about her beloved. But 'no longer' does that bring plea sure. Note the different positions of'nicht mehr' in the second stanza: it follows the mention of roses but then precedes mention of the other objects, as if there were some slight equivocation about the pleasure that came from the roses and thinking about her beloved. 15. See Fellinger, 'Cyclic Tendencies', p. 383. 16. See Friedrich von Bodenstedt, Gesammelte Schriften (Berlin, 1868), vol. 10, pp. 151-84. Bodenstedt made a big splash in 1851, around the time Brahms composed this song, with Die Lieder des Mirza-Schaffy, a volume of oriental poetry on the order of the popular Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. 17. He also removed or altered punctuation to heighten the flow. 18. In Bodenstedt's original poem, these are not parapraxes but rather allusions to Masha's plight. 19. Many of the shared elements mentioned here are also noted by van Rij, Brahms's Song Collections, p. 103. 20. Brahms adopts the title Schumann gave to the poem in Liederkreis, Op. 39, and also uses the emendations that Schumann made to EichendorfFs text, adding 'ach' in line 5 and contracting 'rauschet' to 'rauscht'. 21. The enjambment is unusual in that the averted line break falls mid-word. Malin discusses the enjambment and other aspects of Brahms's response to syntactic flow and poetic structure, particularly in comparison to Schumann's setting; Songs in Motion, pp. 147-51. For a more detailed comparative analysis, see Christiane Jacobsen, Das Verhältnis von Sprache und Musik in ausgewählten Liedern von Johannes Brahms, dargestellt an Parallelvertonungen (Hamburg: Karl Dieter Wagner, 1975), pp. 365-99. Malin, Jacobsen and others take issue with Brahms's placement of the stress in 'Waldeinsamkeit', but the choice is defensible on phonological grounds and certainly, because of the stress it places on solitude, on poetic grounds; as Jacobsen observes, 'what counts here for Brahms is not the romantic forest, not an image of Music Analysis, 31/i (2012) © 2012 The Author.

'A dream', wrote Sigmund Freud, 'can be instigated by an internal process which has, as it were, become a recent event, owing to the thought-activity of the preceding day', and that internal process can be 'the recollection of a psychically important event - a train of thought'; The Interpretation of Dreams, trans, and ed. James Strachey (New York: Basic Books, 1965), pp. 212-13. Recollection was clearly what Eichendorff had in mind, for he later published the first three stanzas as a poem entitled 'Erinnerung', one of a group collected under the heading Wanderlieder. 23. The piano's interlude in bars 26-27 substitutes for the third line of the stanza. Ludwig Finscher attributes the omission to the fact that Brahms, having decided to use the rustling leaves as the primary accompanimental motif and to set the third stanza as the contrasting section of an AABA form, found himself 'at a loss to know how to handle the third line', because it refers back to the rustling of the A sections; 'Brahms's Early Songs: Poetry versus Music', in Bozarth, Brahms Studies, p. 341. Braus (pp. 154-62) argues that Brahms's alteration corrupts the poem's rhetorical structure. 24. Braus notes the harmonic ambiguity of AI/B1&gt; but does not develop it in the way that I do here; see 'Textual Rhetoric', Ch. 12. My interpretation of this stanza is indebted to Finscher's commentary on the bugle calls and the dream; 'Brahms's Early Songs', p. 341. 25. Van Rij (pp. 12-13) specifies two criteria for narrative coherence - consistency of subject narrative voice and linear movement - and regards Op. 3 as one of only a handful of Brahms's collections that might qualify as a 'narrative cycle', in that the poems can be read as the expression of a single persona and arranged as moments in a coherent story, which she describes simply as 'a story of unhappy love' (p. 102). NOTE ON CONTRIBUTOR Robert Snarrenberg teaches music theory and analysis at Washington Univer sity in St. Louis, MO. ABSTRACT Brahms's first bouquet of songs, six settings of poems by four different poets, shows that he was already a sensitive reader of lyric poetry and a composer who could write Romantic miniatures in which the smallest details bear considerable significance. The essay describes musicopoetic elements in each of these six songs and the musical and narrative threads that weave through them. © 2012 The Author.
