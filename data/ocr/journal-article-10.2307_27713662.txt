<plain_text><page sequence="1">KENNETH BURKE AND ROBERT PENN WARREN: CRITICISM BY OBSESSIVE METAPHOR not long ago the writer had occasion to point out certain corruptions in Wordsworth's text initiated by Mr. Empson and perpetuated by Mr. Ransom, then used by both of these critics to condemn Words worth for "muddled" thinking and bad poetry {Philological Quarterly, January 1950). Now it appears that the sharing of discoveries (dis tortions?) by the so-called New Critics is not an uncommon procedure. Mr. Robert Penn Warren, for example, in analyzing "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,,, is willing to inherit a metaphor from Mr. Kenneth Burke and like Mr. Burke to use this metaphor in place of evidence for establishing an eccentric thesis. Though Mr. Warren is usually scrupulous in citing his sources, he is either unaware of his debt to Mr. Burke or has neglected to acknowledge it. And Mr. Burke himself, one finds, is quite unaware of the extent to which he allows a metaphor (an outworn one at that) to conduct his argument for him. Perhaps the metaphor ("under the aegis of . . . ") is "dead" to these critics' conscious minds; perhaps its very deadness explains their unconsciousness of the role it plays in their arguments. Yet it is striking that critics who are known widely as proponents o? fresh metaphor should fall victim to so patent a clich?. In Mr. Burke's Philosophy of Literary Form (1941) the clich? occurs almost every time "The Ancient Mariner" is mentioned. Since both Mr. Burke and Mr. Warren wish to prove that all the events of the poem are controlled by the "maleficent" Sun and the "beneficent" Moon (a thesis that can only be maintained in defiance of the evi dence), it is significant that almost every time either of them men tions the sun or the moon, the clich? "under the aegis of" appears like a conditioned reflex. Here is the record from The Philosophy of Literary Form (the quotations are numbered for easy reference) : 1. We would note that the Mariner suffered his punishments under the aegis of the Sun, and that his cure was effected under the aegis of the Moon (p. 24). 2. ... as we move from suffering under the aegis of the Sun to release un der the aegis of the Moon (p. 25). 3. . . . with the Mariner returning to shore under the aegis of the praying Hermit ... (p. 72). 4. [in reference to the poem, "The Aeolian Harp"] The marital prob lem . . . We note that the poet's apologies to the wife, for instance, are offered under the aegis of noon. We have the deflection from the marriage-feast in 'The Ancient Mariner' at high noon (p. 94). 172</page><page sequence="2">Kenneth Burke and Robert Penn Warren 173 5. For instance, we find that the Sun in 'The Ancient Mariner' breeds rot. At the end we find the Hermit (under whose aegis the Mariner is ab solved) praying on a seat of moss covering a rotted old oak stump (p. 95). 6. . . . the Pilot's boy in 'The Ancient Mariner' acts as the vessel that takes upon itself the most malign features of a cure effected under the aegis of moonlight. . . . [That is, the Pilot's boy "doth crazy go" be cause he drains off, like a good scapegoat, the "loon-acy" of the "grey beard loon." Nothing is said of the contradiction in a "beneficent" moon that both cures from and inspires lunacy.] (p. 101). 7. . . . the 'greybeard loon' whose cure had been effected under the dubi ous aegis of moonlight (p. 287). 8. The structure itself becomes more apparent: the 'loon'-atic Mariner begins his cure from drought under the aegis of a moon that causes a silly rain, thence by synecdoche to silly buckets ... (p. 288). 9. Since the poem is constructed about an opposition between punish ment under the aegis of the sun and cure under the aegis of the moon, one could proceed in other works [further books of criticism] to disclose the two sets of equations clustered about these two principles. Indeed, even in "The Ancient Mariner" itself we get a momentous cue [clue?], as the sun is explicitly said to be "like God's own head." (p.288) It is a bit startling in the third quotation to observe the ' 'aegis" shifting suddenly and causelessly from cosmic bodies to a hermit in the act of prayer! But the mobility of this aegis does not cease here: in the fourth quotation it leaves all bodies behind?cosmic or hermitic ?and attaches itself to a mere sound: the "oon"-sound appears to have spellbound the critic (like "noises in a swound," perhaps?) so that he finds great symbolical meanings not only in "moon" and "noon" but even in "greybeard loon19 (see quotations 6, 7, and 8 above.) In the fifth excerpt, the aegis is hung again on the hermit, and the natural oxidation (rotting) of a tree stump is perceived to be highly meaningful. Why? Because the word "rot" occurred once pre viously in the poem, describing becalmed tropic seas. In the seventh quotation the aegis becomes "dubious." Is there a possible projection here from the critic to his metaphor; does "dubious" reveal a moment of doubt as to the validity of the stated symbolism? As for the eighth quotation, Mr. Burke's "silly rain" is not found in the poem-text. Whatever the Mariner may mean by his reference to "silly buckets," he does not mean: "I hereby invite critics to convert these buckets into manifold significance by waving the wand of Synec doche." As for the ninth quotation, we have only to turn to the poem</page><page sequence="3">174 Ford to demonstrate that in its context the sun that appears "like God's own head" is neither "explicit" nor "momentous," and hardly calls for "other works" of critical exegesis. The figure is appropriate to the nightmarish state of mind of the crew, and vividly points up their medieval, superstitious, and anthropomorphic notions of godhead. If every image in a poem is a symbol, and if every symbol is a kind of mental boat, what is to prevent readers from floating freely down myriads of associational streams to whatever chance island they hap pen to ground upon? Criticism will become an associational brook that, like Tennyson's, rambles on forever. As we follow Mr. Warren on his cruise of symbolism, it is unjust to imply that he floats on a mere stream of association. Everywhere in his grave and austere essay (cf. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, with an Essay by Robert Penn Warren, 1946) he gives evidence of industry and wide reading, freighting his argument with an imposing mass of learned and expatiatory footnotes. Yet one cannot but con clude that the massed footnotes have a primarily polemical function : to win acceptance for the critic's two main theses, both of which are products of an arbitrary symbolism.1 The primary thesis is a theologi cal one, finding the Mariner and his two-hundred-man crew guilty of Original Sin, of "corruption of the will," of "pride" and "self-idolatry" (pp. 81, 82, 130, 131). With this ominous and irrelevant resurrection of medieval scholasticism we are not concerned at present (nothing in the poem or in Coleridge's statements about the poem will support such a thesis), but the critic's secondary thesis deserves our attention, for it is here that the "aegis" metaphor of Mr. Burke passes bodily into the language of Mr. Warren, and forthwith conducts the argu ment in a way that textual evidence could not hope to do. Mr. War ren's secondary thesis is the same as Mr. Burke's thesis about a maleficient Sun and beneficent Moon, though his references to Mr. Burke give barely a hint of this (see notes 95 and 112). Let us see how Mr. Burke's "aegis" plays again its extralogical role in Mr. Warren's argument: 1. ... in the poem the good events take place under the aegis of the moon, the bad events under that of the sun (p. 87). 2. The voyage begins merrily under the aegis of the sun (p. 90). 3. ... to the man living in the world of comfortable familiarity, com placent in himself and under the aegis of the sun ... (p. 90). 4. The fact of these unhappy events under the aegis of the supposedly 1 Professor E. E. Stoll has exhibited many of the vagaries of symbolist criticism as applied to Coleridge ("Symbolism in Coleridge," PMLA, March 1948). He has not, however, commented on the points raised in the present paper</page><page sequence="4">Kenneth Burke and Robert Penn Warren 175 beneficent moon creates a question: Does this violate the symbolism of the moon? (p. 94). 5. . . . presided over by the moon . . . ["presided" here does the work of "aegis"] (p. 96). 6. The sun, under whose aegis the bad events of the poem occur, here appears in a "good" association (p. 97). 7. . . . the role of the moon?the adored, the guiding, the presiding power [Again the translation of "aegis" into "presiding power"] (p. 98). 8. Then we have the recognition of their [the water-snakes'] beauty under the aegis of the moon . . . (p. 104). 9. Two quotations from Mr. Burke in which the "aegis" metaphor is used?tucked away in the midst of an extended footnote which calls no attention to the "aegis" but which agrees that Mr. Burke "is quite properly struck by the suggestive force of the phrase 'silly buckets.' " (This is the 112th of 168 such massive footnotes!) As to the first quotation above, the general reader (for whom Coleridge's ballad was presumably intended) may be forgiven if he discerns nothing cosmically significant in the fact that a medieval sailing vessel leaves harbor in the daytime rather than in darkness or moonlight. Is there any causal connection between the "merry" mood of the crew and the fact that the sun rather than the moon is shining? (see quotation #2). As for the third excerpt, the critic does not appear to notice that his assertedly maleficent sun is here acting in a rather benevolent capacity. The fourth quotation comes face to face with the disconcerting episode, so little in keeping with a "beneficent" moon, in which two hundred mariners dramatically fall dead in the light of the rising moon. Casuistry rescues the arbitrary thesis, however; the two-hundred moon-smitten mariners?and any other failures of evidence to accord with thesis?constitute what Mr. Warren ingen iously calls a "symbolic lag" in the poem (p. 98) ! A reader with a sporting sense would like to smile at the cunningness of this maneuver. Mr. Warren never smiles, however. In quotation #6 the critic again has to admit that his thesis is controverted by the evidence of the poem, but "symbolic lag" will take care of such failures on the part of the poet to anticipate the critic's thesis. The eighth quotation declares the moon's interest in sea-snakes: the snakes are not simply revealed in the light of the moon, they are "under the aegis of the moon." Probably the critic does not intend that we should visualize a lunar shield or protective emblem or a moon-goddess making a sign, but his metaphor encourages some thing of the sort. It is hardly necessary to gather evidence to controvert the thesis</page><page sequence="5">176 Ford that the sun and moon are malign and benign agents in the poem. The most striking disproof of the thesis is the death of the two hundred man crew beneath the rising moon. This disproof would be final could it be shown that either the moon or the sun are causal agents in the poem. Actually the moon and the sun are nowhere repre sented as causes or agents in the action. They are mentioned only when Coleridge wishes to indicate the weather, make vivid the setting, or reveal that the vessel is sailing southward toward the antarctic or northward from Cape Horn ("The sun came up upon the left, / . . . and on the right / Went down into the sea"?11. 25-28. "The Sun now rose upon the right: / . . . and on the left / Went down into the sea" ?11. 83-86). Coleridge rightly judged that the goings and comings of sun and moon would be eagerly noted on a monotonous sea journey. Demonic and angelic spirits are agents in the action, but sun and moon are neutral. There is of course no hint of the "aegis" idea in the poem. One is impelled to ask why Mr. Burke and Mr. Warren so iterantly insist on the metaphor. Would it not be simpler to speak of events that happen "under the sun or the moon" rather than under their "aegis"? And what does it mean to hook an aegis not only onto the sun and moon but also onto an Old Hermit and onto the (unbodied) hour of "noon"? Perhaps we should look for the answer in the function of the aegis, not its structure?a distinction that Mr. Burke insists on as basic to aesthetic judgment (pp. 73-74 et seq.). What then is the function of the "aegis" metaphor, assuming that it is not a mere conditioned reflex beneath the threshold of consciousness? The function is pre sumably rhetorical: instead of logic or evidence, prestige is lent to the thesis from vague heroic associations. The implication is that Coleridge himself was controlled by the aegis-idea even though his poem manifestly contradicts any such assumption. What is interesting, and not a little dangerous, is the method of "argument" used by both Mr. Burke and Mr. Warren. Beginning with a "hunch," as Mr. Burke sportingly calls it (p. 79), they hop from image to image, touching with a magic wand every image that can be linked by some train of association with this "hunch." The wand automatically converts the image into a "symbol," and from here on the way is easy. Where the evidence controverts the thesis, "Synecdoche" or "symbolic lag" resolves the difficulty. To say this is not to deny that poetry is often?perhaps always? symbolical. It is simply to remind ourselves that some poems obvi</page><page sequence="6">Kenneth Burke and Robert Penn Warren 177 ously make liberal use of symbolism and some make very scanty use of it. The method applicable to Prometheus Unbound is not applicable to ballads. It is not at all, or only very slightly, applicable to "The Ancient Mariner," the meaning and purpose of which are defined not only by the poem-text, but by Coleridge's gloss (added later), his statement to Mrs. Barbauld on the "moral" (Table Talk, May 31, 1830), his statement in the Biographia Literaria (ch. xiv), Words worth's account of the genesis of the poem (in his note to "We are seven"), and the vogue of the supernatural ballad at the time. In short, no interpretation is valid that ignores these controls, and if medieval theology or psychoanalysis are to be intruded, they must be made to harmonize with these controls and they must be justified by them. Otherwise they are "importations," as I. A. Richards well described such irrelevances (Practical Criticism). "Contraband," we might frankly label them. Let it be acknowledged that both Mr. Burke and Mr. Warren furnish quite irreproachable descriptions of method, Mr. Burke in the beginning of his book and Mr. Warren in the conclusion of his. Mr. Burke is always stimulating even when he is absurd; he has a lively and agile mind, and a touch of the circus-rider in him. Since Mr. Warren's achievements as critic and creative writer are numerous and distinguished, it would be particularly unfortunate if his prestige lent authority to the symbolical method as he has applied it to Coleridge's ballad, where he not only engages in an austerely scholastic wrestling match with Original Sin, but converts the innocuous sun into a malign force equatable with "the reflective faculty" (p. 93), "the light of practical convenience" (p. 93), "the light in which pride preens itself" (p. 93), "the understanding" (p. 93), "the Enlightenment" (p. 93), the "Age of Reason" (p. 93), "the sun of death" (p. 93), "the death-bark" (p. 94), and the "blood bath" of the French Revolution (p. 93) ; where he converts a simple old Hermit into "a priest of God" (p. 99), "a priest of Nature" (p. 99), "a priest of Society" (p. 100), and "a priest of imagination" (p. 104); and where he requires the Old Navigator himself to become not a seaman but a "po?te maudit" (p. 106 et seq.), ? la Verlaine. Such a procedure could conceivably, as Mr. Warren hopes, "reconcile . . . the internecine malices" (p. 117) writhing within (some of) us, but for others it will only increase the writhing?and gnashing of teeth.
