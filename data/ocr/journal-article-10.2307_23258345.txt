Dennett is both an avowed atheist and defender of naturalism in philosophy. Yet if we pay heed to the entirety of Dennett's claims a curious picture emerges. My suggestion is that Hegel and Marx represent the rival responses to what we might call the modern predic ament: what is the nature of existence in a world which seems a mechanism? Dennett's response to this question is Hegelian, and involves a commitment to a religiosity which might surprise those otherwise receptive to his arguments. Keywords Dennett • Deism • Naturalism ■ Hegel ■ Marx • Darwin Dennett provides us with accounts of human freedom, consciousness, being, mind, morality and (implicitly) the social role of the theorist. Indeed, one commentator believes that the sole omission in Dennett's corpus is an account of the polis (Ross 2000, p. 25). Yet among philosophers admiration is not universal. Many have thought Dennett "slippery"; too willing to avoid criticism by being strategically imprecise. It has also been suggested that Dennett's work is so broad he cannot be said to have a coherent theory or position, and (contrarily) that Dennett is in fact an Hegelian (Churchland 2002, pp. 64, 66, 79). I would argue that this latter suggestion is in fact a considerable insight. In Breaking the Spell Dennett sought to provide an account of how religious beliefs might have emerged and become established. While he concedes that it is possible, even likely, that such beliefs conferred advantages on those holding them, the avowed aim of the project is polemical: Dennett wishes us to consider rationally whether we are wise to be as tolerant towards religion as we are.

Dennett professes himself not hostile but "indifferent" to . .the Ground of All Being, whatever that is" (2006, p. 266). Religion is defined narrowly; ".. .lone communicants..." are not religious, and nor are those whose faith does not entail".. .a supernatural agent or agents whose approval is to be sought" (pp. 9, 11). My approach is to take a "stance" towards Dennett. In The Intentional Stance (1987) Dennett famously counselled that understanding one another, and any intelligent crea ture, means assuming rationality and purpose. It seems obvious that we might apply this method to Dennett and ask, "What is this theorist about?" Dahlbom (1993, pp. 163-165) characterises Dennett as a victim of intellectual fashion, seduced by laissez faire. I believe the reality is rather more complex and interesting. There is, though, much in what Dahlbom says. Dennett is a political writer, and does indeed have an account of the polis: the modern Western state, the duties it imposes on its citizens, and the relationship such states maintain with the rest of the world, are quite adequate (Brook and Ross 2002, p. 9). We need not consider any radical change in our lives, can never be radically free and responsible and must have a morality rooted in communal self-interest. Yet the strictures which Dennett is obliged to accept on all theorising—this (after all) is for him an inertial universe where persons are contingent ciphers—would seem to preclude "political" contributions on the nature of responsibility, morality and social justice. The suggestion I would wish to pursue is that it is Hegelianism which squares this circle. I should perhaps note at the outset that I will not seek to defend the claim that Hegel gives genuine succour to theorists who wish to become theoreticians. Nor do I believe that Dennett is animated by a conscious intention. As he says, those who cease believing in God may ".. .seek a substitute.. .[in a process which].. .need not be all that conscious and deliberate" (2006, p. 205). Beings can, as Dennett would be the first to maintain, display self-interested intentionality without knowing what they do. Communication Within academia certain canonical assumptions are made. Authors are presumed to relate the truth as they understand it, and we assume that freedom of publication, in the round, promotes the common good. This certainly seems the "Western" assumption, dating from at least Milton's Areopagitica. Academics presume a notionally perfect reader, and a world where those not able to engage in this practice neither interfere with it nor are misled by it. Yet some theorists, including Dennett, see even scientific truth as potentially harm ful. The difficulty is not simply the use of the fruits of science: Truman needlessly using Oppenheimer's bomb. Rather, there are gaps between the "literal" meanings of words, what we mean in saying them, and what we are understood to have meant. If Dennett's friend Paulina, for example, (a life science researcher) discovered a complex means for eradicating HIV, she might have to keep her findings secret. Her work might otherwise be misrepresented as a straightforward "cure", or be understood as such, producing an increase in risky behaviour, illness and death (Dennett 2003, pp. 17-18). Dennett strongly accepts words as social acts (2003, p. 17), holding us liable for even "likely misrepresentations" of our locutions (1995, p. 393, also p. 150). In philosophy &lt;£] Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 223 . .the gap between authorial pretence and effect achieved.. .is more comic than pathetic" (1993a, p. 203). Indeed, perhaps ".. .deliberate obscurantism and .. .stylised poses" might be better than the ".. .analysis and argument.. .so manifestly beyond us". Dennett maintains that "philosophical writing [involves].. .build[ing] devices... to achieve certain effects". This awareness of the characteristics of his audience of course raises questions as to how transparent Dennett's work is. Dennett's view of his role has two components. He believes we face social and polit ical problems produced by, and inextricably connected to, our minds. He also believes he possesses (apparently by the grace of geist) the means to repair our weakness. Our predicament Dennett believes we are often failed by reason, our minds taken over by inherited thought processes (so-called "bugbears"). The metaphysics of freedom, for example, seems a serious problem, yet it is also a peculiarly Western "problem". Conceivably we have been trained to see "the" problem, our minds running in "ruts" (Dennett 1984, pp. 5-6, 12). Generally, though, we are ignorant of the origins of our beliefs (Dennett 2003, p. 244), and distract ourselves with the "problem" of metaphysical freedom while ignoring political and social freedom—a more worthy goal (p. 278). Breaking the Spell is similarly a "just so" story, designed to free us from the hold of religion by rendering an account of how it might have taken over our minds. It also seems to be beliefs toxic to freedom, the "scum" of the West, which repro duce easily, and inoculation is difficult (Dennett 2003, p. 304). Our survival depends on mankind conceiving of the world correctly: the right "memes" must triumph (p. 305). But confounded by imaginary problems we are incapable of addressing real threats, and of accepting science (especially Darwinism), which is our last best hope (1984, p. 4, 2003, pp. 5, 15). Our salvation A naturalistic account of our symbiotic relationship with the universe must handle error circumspectly; if our evolved reason has produced poor outcomes we surely cannot be sanguine (even hopeful) about the future. After all, we have always been "at one with the world", so past systematic errors must surely augur further calamities. For Dennett the environment may well exercise benign control over us. Reason is "ensconced" in the universe, being the name given to this successful interaction, the universe being devoid of "motiveless malignity" (1984, pp. 61-62, 118, 2003, pp. 40, 159). Yet, it seems, helpful strategic interventions, such as Dennett's, also remain necessary. Theorists differ in their prescriptions, and Dennett recognises he must compete for attention. This is a question of tactics (2003, pp. 19-20,224): the wider public must be persuaded of the uselessness of metaphysics and the hidden agendas of some theorists (1984, pp. 136-137, 2003, preface). Only an unreflective thinker would fail to consider that he might be mistaken. Dennett concedes we may not be prepared for an unvarnished naturalistic vision of *£) Springer</page><page sequence="4">224 Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 ourselves (replacing the "cracked myth" of religion, God and the soul), but thinks us ready to "grow up" (2003, pp. 21,290). However, those disagreeing might legitimately misrepresent Dennett's work (2003, pp. 19-20). Those un-persuaded by Dennett's defence of Darwinism are encouraged to ".. .reject it and fight on..(1995, p. 521). This, of course, leaves unexplained the source of Dennett's faith that our most needed beliefs will spread most readily. The answer to this question sits very uneasily within the Dennettian project as a whole, even if it is intrinsic to its coherence. First, though, we should consider the supposed advantages of Dennett's philosoph ical naturalism. To reiterate, the goal is the defence of freedom (political and ideally metaphysical) and the alleviation of anxiety (Dennett 1984, pp. 18, 153-155, 168— 169). Dennett believes that naturalism achieves this, providing a footing for free will, morality and our self-understanding (Dennett 1984, p. 170, 2003, pp. 1, 16). Anti-nat uralism seemingly destroys the ability to think (2003, pp. xi-xii). Science is no "myth" and its "methods" are applicable across subject areas (Dennett 2003, pp. 5-6). "Time magazine standard..respect for science ".. .leads inexorably..to Dennett's view (1993a, p. 205). Our previous self-understanding—that we were unlike other natural bodies, made in God's image and possessed of a motivating soul was (unlike science) "brittle" (2003, p. 306). People care about their place in the universe, but their intuition is supported by the Darwinian account (p. 307). We believe both that our freedom is vastly greater than that of animals and also that we are part of the natural world. Some imagine these beliefs cannot coexist, and are driven to sever the mind from the brain, or believe we are animated by elan vital, or that we are touched by God. But this involves self-deception: we are part of the natural world, and must know it. Moreover, human exceptionalism is unnecessary (p. 308). An account of the place of language and culture in our lives leaves us as denizens of the natural world and citizens of the polis: free and capable unlike anything else. The crow If action depends on belief—which seems uncontroversial—then we need some account of the origins of beliefs. Dennett is much exercised by this question. He quotes with approval Wittgenstein; philosophy is concerned with preventing the "bewitch ment" of our reason by language (Dennett 1984, p. 18). The mature Wittgenstein and Dennett agree that language is usage, so that analytical attempts to "define our terms" may mislead us. But developed human reason is a product of memes (such as theo ries) transmitted by language; Wittgenstein, after all, did not communicate by way of expressive dance. So the theorist can at best be a "memetic engineer", "tuning" our beliefs through the deft use of language (Dennett 2003, pp. 250, 266, 278-279). Ever the populariser, Dennett (2003, p. 14) explains his point using Disney's Dumbo, who could fly, but was rendered incapable by self-defeating beliefs. The "noble lie" surrounding the "magic" feather liberated him. But bringing Dumbo crashing to the ground requires merely an unhelpful (although truthful) crow to cast doubt on the feather's powers. Dennett believes philosophers enjoy being "crows", discomfiting the complacently happy (2003, p. 294). But he also believes that he is wrongly thought to be such a &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 225 crow. In fact we live in a fortunate age: today the truth, not noble lies, will set us free. Fatalism would be an unfortunate consequence of a spreading acceptance of deter minism, but Dennett's (presumed successful) defence of compatibilism prevents this. Established religion was probably useful to us (p. 22), comforting people and keeping us alive to evolve something better (1995, p. 518, 2006, passim). But we have created something better. Just as the old ideas died, perhaps killed by the shock of the new, we acquired the "prosthetics" we need (2003, pp. 294, 297). Like Dumbo our only fear is paralysing fear itself (pp. 294, 306). We want the truth, but have to try harder to see it (1984, pp. 170-171). But we will recognise it if we look: we can see that the "beast" of naturalistic Darwinism is in fact helpful and beautiful (1995, p. 521). Serendipitously, our fitness to hear the truth arrived with it. Finally our "being" has created a "knowing" not merely pragmatically useful, but essentially true. Soon, for the first time, we will live an un-deluded life. We might almost think that Dennett's only possible role is to make us cognisant of this revolutionary fact. Knowing and being Arguably the first developed account of the rootedness of mind in the world is the Marx/Engels critique of Hegel. Once attention is drawn to these theorists (and Marx and Engels contemporaries of (and influenced by) Darwin), their usefulness in con textualising the Dennettian project is remarkable. Dennett faces the same difficulties faced by these theorists: once man is the universe's product, what could knowing be? But Hegel, Marx and Engels, unlike Dennett, were well aware of the narrow place left the theorist by this new vision. Marx and Engels' account of the emergence of their thought is not explicit. The key expressions of their theory are The German Ideology and Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. The former is an account of how thinkers, usually for self-interested rea sons, fail to recognise the circumstantial origins of their intellectual productions. The latter work separates all accounts of how the world "ought" to be from that "scientific" theory which describes natural processes of change. In The German Ideology the failure of theorists to recognise empirical reality's role in the production of mind is castigated. "Old Hegelians", in thrall to Hegel, imagine the world is produced by concepts, rather than concepts being produced in men's minds by their worldly interactions. Hegel, an Idealist, could imagine The Philosophy of Right as an account of pre-existing timeless ideas of "Abstract Right", "Morality" and "The State" being realised in the corporeal world. "Young Hegelians" (once includ ing Marx), also saw concepts ruling the world, but ".. .attackjed] this dominion as usurpation, while [Old Hegelians] extol... it as legitimate" (Tucker 1972, p. 149). In other words, Young Hegelians wanted, as an act of political will, to change society's ideology. Marx dismissed them all en bloc; nobody ".. ,inquire[s] into the connection of German philosophy with German reality, the relation of.. .criticism to.. .material surroundings". The dependent status of intellect is forcefully asserted: Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their correspond ing. . .consciousness.. .have no history, no development; but men, developing &lt;£l Springer</page><page sequence="6">226 Int J Philos Relig (2012)71:221 -238 their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life (p. 155, my emphasis). The origin of errors in our understanding is found in our attempt to sustain ourselves (p. 154). Language itself".. .is practical consciousness that exists also for other men, and for that reason alone it really exists for me as well; language, like consciousness, only arises from the need, the necessity, of intercourse with other men" (p. 158, my emphasis). This mirrors Dennett's account. For Dennett good is "good for", and the emergence of creatures able to defend their interests is the origin of good, evil and morality. For Marx man is a productive survival-oriented creature, and his intellectual products are reflexes of that fact, morality merely an expression of the needs of the age's dominant class. As feudal economic relations declined so therefore did the seemingly immuta ble notion of liege service. Similarly, modern contract law followed industrialisation, at first seeming alien and then self-evident. For Dennett language and consciousness are tools for interaction, and so, mutatis mutandis, they are for Marx. Most tellingly, both theorists emphasise productive processes; to understand is to grasp change, or (as Dennett would put it) the role of algorithms (including every process producing change which might attract our interest). Engels' Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, explains the implications of this thesis for theorists. Humans are creatures of their times, so their possibilities are contin gent: we must".. .connect with the intellectual stock-in-trade" (Tucker 1972, p. 683). Reason itself is a historical product. Even great thinkers cannot ".. .go beyond the limits imposed upon them by their epoch" (p. 684). Justice, for example, is intrinsic to the times; we cannot ".. .evolve out of the human brain" (p. 687, my emphasis) the product of centuries of hard life ("life" being the algorithmic process which creates our minds and our notions of justice). One thinker, aside from Marx, has given life to our new worldview:".. .Darwin must be named before all others.. .[having dealt] the metaphysical conception of Nature the heaviest blow" (p. 697), while allowing us to conceive of economic competition as ".. .the Darwinian struggle of the individual for existence transferred from Nature to society with intensified violence" (p. 706). Therefore (over a century before Dennett) Marx and Engels had understood that if man was a product, then "knowing"—our evolved interrogative stance to the world— could only be a reflexive adaptation. Marx and Engels theory becomes ".. .nothing but the reflex, in thought, of [class conflict]" (p. 702, my emphasis). To "know" is merely to have natural dispositions produced by life. A perch for the crow Engels, in one of philosophy's great aphorisms, declared that understanding the "material" origins of our intellect meant explaining ".. .man's "knowing" by his "being", instead of, as heretofore, his "being" by his "knowing" (Tucker 1972, p. 699). The anti-Cartesianism is obvious and, of course, sits squarely with Dennett's war on the Cartesian view that some observer witnesses and evaluates the presentations &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 227 of the senses. Marx and Engels unfailingly characterise our intellectual lives as the outcome of our needs-driven symbiotic relationship with the world. Yet they under stand the threatened performative contradiction: Engels' privileged life, and Marx's residence in the British library, presumably produced "beings" unequipped with any great "knowing". The petard used for Idealists and Utopians seems to beckon. This difficulty is compounded as Marx and Engels (like Dennett) were theoreticians; the theoretical work was intended to have some practical effect. But practical activ ity sits uneasily with proscriptive attacks on pretentious theorists. Marx and Engels (formally) restrict themselves to "comprehendfing]" the meaning of the proletariat's acts, and making them aware of their character (Tucker 1972, p. 717). Even the polit ical Manifesto maintains that socialistic principles are not . .invented, or discov ered. . .[but] merely express.. .actual relations springing.. .from a historical movement going on under our very eyes" (p. 484). A Marxist might respond to this circumscription of the theorist's role by citing the famous eleventh Theses on Feuerbach: "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it" (p. 145). Intellectual libera tion (given the social construction of minds) requires ".. .the practical overthrow of the actual social relations which give rise to this idealistic humbug" (p. 164). But making coherent the criticisms of Hegel and of the "Utopians" means accepting the limitations Marx and Engels placed on themselves, those limitations inherent in their account of the relationship of mind to material circumstances. Marx and Engels could participate in revolutionary activity, but not qua theorists. They must, given their being, have less knowledge than the proletariat demonstrate in their actions. To turn to Hegel, it is the mistaken perception of undiluted conservatism that damns Hegel for many. For Engels, though, Hegel was a genius, his proto-Darwinism produc ing a reconfigured history as ".. .the process of evolution of man himself'. However, such a process ".. .cannot find its intellectual final term in.. .any.. .absolute truth". Hegel wrongly ".. .laid claim to.. .[espousing that].. .absolute truth" (Tucker 1972, p. 698). However, Hegel's account of theorising is virtually indistinguishable from those of Marx and Engels, and is markedly similar to Dennett's account of reason as a social practice. Our minds are the product of circumstances, and . .every individual is a child of his time" (Knox 1967, p. 11). Philosophers too remain "children": philosophy can no more . .transcend its contemporary world" than an ".. .individual can over leap his own age..Hegel, like Marx and Engels, contrasts understanding with the erroneous project of constructing a state . .as it ought to be". Philosophy . .comes on the scene too late..." to give advice, spreading its metaphorical wings ".. .only with the falling of the dusk" (pp. 12-13). More prosaically, a theorist seeks to understand the living evolving reality which made him. There is necessarily some very significant, as Dennett would dub it, ".. .closure of the mind" (1995, pp. 381, 489). Yet notwithstanding this commonality, the source of Marx's antipathy is clear. Hegel's lodestone is, "What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational" (Knox 1967, p. 10). So what exists may lack some final divine imprimatur, but the world is not purposeless (p. 302); the "universe of mind..is not at".. .the mercy of chance and caprice, .. .God-forsaken..(p. 4, my emphasis). The world (purportedly) is animated by God's spirit. This claim, not simply Hegel's Idealism, marked the real Springer</page><page sequence="8">228 Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 rupture with Marx. A theodical account describes God coming to know himself in a world containing evil, and Hegel believed his history was the "true theodicy" (Tucker 1972, p. 175). Berry concurs, maintaining that".. .Hegel's view of history as a The odicy is no mere rhetorical sop to his audience, but is fundamental to his vision and system as a whole" (Berry 1982, p. 191). By following Berry, and locating Hegel and Hume as responses to the post-Cartesian world, we can see clearly Dennett's predicament. For Hegel "spirit" moves the world, and has no alternative. Herder's God of mere "force", like Hobbes's unseen first cause, or Dennett's Big Bang, implies a division between the first "spring" (divine or otherwise) and the "clay" of the world. Hegel (like Dennett) could not tolerate meaninglessness (Berry 1982, p. 137). But identifying meaning means displacing our "centre of gravity" (p. 139): man becomes part of a universe coming to know itself, so spirit knows itself in the mind of philosophical man. Or more bluntly, God knows himself to be God only when humans know God to be their maker: ".. .without the world God is not God" (PRel I, 200, Berry 1982, p. 191). Some humans are fortu itously in at the end of history, with the ".. .Christian recognition of Geist..and God's death as a human, demonstrating man's infinite worth (p. 180). So, as Lowith put it, .. .the history of the world is to Hegel a history BC and AD not incidentally or conventionally but essentially. Only on this presupposition of the Christian reli gion as the absolute truth could Hegel construct universal history systematically from China up to the French Revolution. (In Berry 1982, p. 182) Presuming the meaningfulness of human existence to found this Hegelian account is circular, but for Hegel not viciously so, being ".. .the very self-authenticating struc ture of the Absolute" (Berry 1982, p. 184). If the world was not God-forsaken then God's existence would give us faith in him, and we would succeed in coming to know how God existed in the world (as Hegel thought he had). Hegel's theory can be contextualised. Shocking social diversity was a fact for Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment philosophers. They might have simply con cluded that this was a simple fact, but the Enlightenment mind sought causes. So instead we have the Humean account of the universal human dispositions—vanity, sympathy, induction, kindness to children, and so on (Berry 1982, pp. 60-61), with even morality being rooted in an atavistic sentiment, and ".. .more properly felt than judg'd" (Treatise p. 470). This non-relativistic given nature was realised in circum stances which produced apparent diversity (Berry 1982, pp. 68, 117-118). Hegel, by contrast, accepts ".. .that the human mind itself... has a history", so cognition var ies (pp. 65-66). Therefore even radical difference has a place as a progenitor of the present, assuming God in the world. The Hegelian and Humean accounts of man, and their rejection of contingency, can be summarised: The developmental (Hegelian) view defines mankind temporally; it assimilates the history of mankind to a process, so that it now "makes sense" to employ organic language or talk of the "whole" possessing attributes. Mankind is progressive. To Hume, mankind is defined atemporally; it enjoys certain •£) Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Phiios Relig (2012) 71:221-238 229 propensities etc which are ever present, though their exercise will, as history shows, vary with circumstances... (Berry 1982, p. 124) For Hegel the universe is a whole, rendered benign by God's presence throughout, and his love of (and as) man. Marx's criticism of Hegel is fully "Feuerbachian": the universe is indeed evolving, but man's notions of God are themselves the deluded products of that relationship. However, both Marx and Hegel can account for their own understanding without contravening their meta-philosophical commitments. For Marx the material world purportedly impresses its truth into working men's minds. But by subordinating them selves as chroniclers, Marx and Engels avoid producing an actionable critique through reason: as "knowing" is determined by "being" they must foreswear this. Indeed, the Marx/Engels account of rationality is necessarily thin, as our minds will be a func tion of an unseen future. Hegel, similarly, avoids falling foul of his own strictures. As the world is present expression of geist, philosophy merely describes spirit's pro gress. Hegel may be a deeply conservative thinker, whose theory may have the effect, designedly or otherwise, of defending established orders. But given his fundamental claim that the universe is not God-forsaken Hegel can explain his theorising: just like Marx he is merely producing a chronicle, describing God's movement rather than the proletariat's actions. Dennett's perch As a Darwinian Dennett must have a naturalistic account of the mind: being must produce knowing. Yet this process must account for his theorising, and also survive our knowledge of modernity: Marx did not see 20th century Marxism, but he saw enough of the 19th century to declare himself no Marxist. It is in Darwin's Dangerous Idea that Dennett explains the origin and social effects of our intellectual products, but does not so much describe a place for the social theorist as delineate a problem. To anticipate my conclusion, Dennett can only com plete his account of "knowing" and "being" by committing explicitly to a broadly Hegelian stance. Dennett must then become much more modest. Dennett (like Hegel) sees history as benign and progressive. But his broad evolutionary theory, like that of Hegel and Marx, necessarily reduces the theorist's role to vanishing point. Of course, Dennett could undergo a (for want of a better expression) damascene conversion, and conclude that there is something quixotic in his compatibilism, his strained account of morality and the trenchancy of his rejection of the specialness of consciousness. If, contra Dennett, metaphysical freedom was a consequence of consciousness then mind and "knowing" may no longer be functions of being. We might then be radically, and "unnaturally", free. But then, of course, we could not avoid, by citing the "natu ral" limitations on our morality and sentiments, what many see as the onerous moral responsibilities we face. Bluntly, either ambition, or the limitations on it, must go. Dennett may cease his pretensions to manage modernity—the "Hegel/Marx" option. Alternatively, he may admit that his work is ideological, the product of a desire to buttress the extant with science. But Dennett's "perch" will not support his weight: if knowing is being there can be no actionable diagnosis, and Dennett must desist from &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="10">230 Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 his prescriptive activity. Alternatively, if we are truly capable of knowing then we are radically free and fully responsible, and Dennett's defence of the present is obviously ideological. Dennett seems confused even as to whether Darwin threatens us. Sometimes Darwin's impact is described broadly dispassionately: he may provide a new "foun dation" for our understanding, may have "inverted" the world, have (as Marx thought) ended teleology in science or (as Nietzsche believed) killed God (Dennett 1995, pp. 11, 25, 62). Yet Dennett also portrays Darwin as incontrovertibly dangerous. The theory (apparently) attracts psychopaths and "cuts" more deeply than its defenders realise (p. 264, also p. 18). Elsewhere conservatism is the problem. After all, Galileo sim ilarly inverted the world and we adapted readily (p. 19). Of course this is especially so if Darwin is, after all, not dangerous. This claim, too, finds favour with Dennett. Darwinian "universal acid" strengthens everything it passes through (pp. 63,521): an odd acid. A good Hegelian should face no such difficulty. Either Darwin is an agent of God in the world, or he is without ultimate significance. Hegelianism implies that the truth value of claims or innovations enjoy "preservative transcendence" during conflicts and debates: the valuable part of Darwin will survive the "Darwin wars". Similarly Marx, seeking to articulate a scientific (and hence descriptive) account, can judge every the orist as correct (but irrelevant: himself and Engels) or mistaken (and irrelevant: Hegel and Utopians). Dennett, deprived of open appeal to deistic solace, cannot admit his certainty that Darwinism is benign. This discomfort is only part of Dennett's unease with the intellectual life: as men tioned earlier, he does not assume a careful readership. Rhetoric and "artful methods" are necessary, people are "deaf', their imaginations "flail...", and "entrenched" prej udices make formal arguments impossible (1995, pp. 11, 12, 21, 25, 155, 394). Often people have "filters" which prevent understanding; anything seemingly "scientistic" or "sociobiological" is dismissed without ado (pp. 350,361-362,386). Even Dahlbom and Rorty fail to understand Consciousness Explained as Dennett intended (Dennett 1993a, p. 204). Many academics read with "a broad brush", classic texts are skimmed once, and people opine on biology but are ignorant of elementary errors (1995, pp. 263, 265, 268, 275fn). Even within their own field other scholars err: world renowned mathematician Roger Penrose misunderstands the nature of algorithms (p. 308). But of course interdisciplinary writing has similar dangers: Churchland and Ramachandran (1993, pp. 30, 49-50) accuse Dennett of ignoring scientific evidence to a degree suggesting "Flat Earthness". Many would not use these supposed problems to justify agitprop. Dennett believes, however, that "campaigning" is rife in biology and other disciplines, and this has spread erroneous beliefs. Gould (who suggests that many evolutionary events may be dramatic and essentially maladaptive) is a particular source: the very fact that he is pro lific means he can be presumed to have an agenda, most probably of Christian/Marxist origin (Dennett 1995, pp. 239,262,264-265,309-310). In the battle for minds Dennett believes we might acknowledge as Darwin did (a suggestion echoed by Kuhn) that only the young are receptive to new ideas, and so should be the focus of the persuasive effort (1995, pp. 38-39): we no longer reward this with hemlock, after all. So there is a need to fight "political" battles within disciplines, and to produce pan-disciplinary writing ^ Springer</page><page sequence="11">Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221 -238 231 aimed at a wide audience (1995, pp. 11, 21, 58). Few philosophers follow Dennett in tasking graduate students to . .unearth "telling" neurophysiological work..(Akins 1993, p. 149). Rorty (1993, p. 198)) tells Dennett that verificationism must be made to seem ".. .glamorous, exciting, and exactly what the age demands", to which Dennett replies, "I'm trying, I'm trying" (p. 233). The outcome of this project, for Wilks (2002, p. 269), sees Dennett. .rise above individual disciplines into an airy region with no real criteria for the judgment of what is said and claimed, while appearing very up-to date in the use of metaphors from other subjects..It perhaps goes without saying that some might think the dividing line between "artful" writing and indoctrination a rather thin one. Wittgenstein's claim that what matters in philosophy is the process, not the desti nation, is rejected (Dennett 1995, p. 141), and Dennett seemingly thinks it obvious that Gould errs in seeking the separation of science and religion (p. 310). Yet all con tributions in these political battles are, remarkably, soon liberated from our intentions, having unintended effects and suffering mutation (pp. 346, 349, 353). Nietzsche and some sociobiologists were wilfully reckless (pp. 464,491), but nobody can know the destination of their "brainchildren". Stated thus Dennett's position seems odd. If "knowing" is a function of "being" we can run through the possibilities. Either Dennett is witness to (in essence, gestur ing towards) change mandated by irresistible material forces, his witness an ultimate irrelevance—in which case he can have his naturalism, but loses his significance. Alter natively, the bulk of humanity is as distanced from meaningful discourse as Dennett believes, and the evolved practices which we imagined contributed to the development of truth are malfunctioning. In this case the modest Hegel/Marx position is abandoned, but a naturalistic account which would explain both the limitations and resilience of the masses, not to mention the seemingly "unnatural" abilities of the elect, seems difficult. Dennett recognises this choice, but cannot make it. He dallies with the latter option, speculating that society might rest on beliefs the masses do not understand (1995, p.509), but there is more evidence that (remarkably) Dennett is a de facto deist. Portraying the universe as purposeless movement is problematic, and Dennett is aware of the difficulties: movement means there are no natural "joints" where we may identify a cause or actor. An electron or magnetic field may exhibit characteristics, and exert effects, but labelling it a "cause" is wholly arbitrary. A causal chain of events flows of necessity, with every "cause" also an effect, its status as a "cause" merely stipulated. As Hobbes saw, there is only one real cause, and it is that".. .which... men call God". But in a mere causal chain there is no principled reason to avoid saying, "The nucleic acids invented human beings in order to be able to reproduce them selves on the Moon", or, "A scholar is just a library's way of making another library" (Dennett 1995, pp. 342,346). We can similarly remove substantive existence from eth icists by granting it to the process producing ethicists (p. 495). Genes can be rendered insubstantive; the environment can be our stipulated actor or "cause", expressing itself through the creation of phenotypes (p. 395). Brains, let alone minds, can be ignored, and culture can become the user of brains; even an ode to a nightingale might be the product of a dumb algorithm (pp. 443, 451). This vision is Dennett's, and accurately represents determinism's difficulties. Dennett tells us that Nature's "experiment" with &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="12">232 Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 culture is recent, and we have no warrant it will end well (pp. 364-365). Humanity, and its "genes" and "memes", is thus simply part of the indivisible universe's movement. Exempting the mind from nature to avoid this conclusion is a tactic Dennett seem ingly rejects. Locke thought it inconceivable that matter could produce thought, there fore (as Dennett characterises it) ".. .Mind must come first—or at least tied for first" (pp. 27-28, 66). We, who can imagine a thinking robot, can (supposedly) easily see how matter may think (p. 66). But Dennett, to avoid the above absurdities (wilful libraries making scholars, and so on), and to avoid conceiving of his brain as".. .a sort of dung heap..." or".. .informa tional diaspora...", where he may not be .in charge..." (p. 346), does need some account of why brain matter creates a "joint" where the universe might reasonably be carved: if the brain mechanistically runs "syntactic code" the "input" to the senses seems an equally valid "joint". The justification, it seems, lies in our acquiring useful dispositions from interacting with the world, including our interactions with infor mation. We can reflect, compare and infer—all of the operations of the mind Hume described—and leave records of this for others. Compared to animals our intelligence is ".. .right off the scale..." thanks to our minds being "knit together" by language (pp. 381, 383). So, for example, the complex truths of maths are eternal and we, despite our limitations, can come to know them (pp. 489-490, 494-495). Perhaps, as McGinn (1993, p. 92) says, God could see logic "lurking" in our minds, ready to be ".. .expanded into mathematics". Newton was able to discover—in effect mirror—the very principles of the universe (Dennett 1995, 139, 176, 184,184fn). The universe has made us so that we regard it as axiomatic that we should believe the true and value the beautiful (pp. 363, 366). In effect, as Dewey claimed, a moving universe sustains a notion of the good in us (p. 403); the notion that the universe requires us to bear its notion of goodness is, of course, strikingly Hegelian. But if these mental operations are mechanisms it may seem we are no further for ward. The "output" of the interconnected brains of humans must be as inevitable as the experientially-bound inferences of the simplest creature. Or as Hall puts it, tak ing evolution by blind algorithm seriously makes it difficult to discuss evolution, or anything else (Dennett 1995, p. 352). The route taken by Dennett to find a place for mind is so difficult we should note the more "natural" alternative. Locke's claim that mind must come before matter can be naturalised, and Dennett (perhaps demonstrating the Hegelian "cunning of reason") explains how. Mind may be, as Dennett says, ".. .tied for first", or as Aristotle would say, first".. .in the order of things", if not temporally. Mind was, on Dennett's account, immanent in Locke's ".. .incogitative Matter and Motion..the universe, after all, created minds. We could claim that mind is the universe's raison d'etre, just as the oak tree is the acorn's. This necessitates a kind of gestalt-switch, preparing the mind for another revolution. Dennett notes Hume's suggestion, that our world might be the work of a remorseless "stupid mechanic", has been effectively restated by Smolin, who has postulated that black holes might create "offspring universes", fabricating every possible material configuration. As Dennett puts it, "In the course of eternity, you can [in design terms] go everywhere" (1995, pp. 178-179, my emphasis). This, though, suggests a very difficult "fork" for Dennett. As a naturalist Dennett presumably would not wish to 4j Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221 -238 233 claim that it is an a priori verity that matter, regardless of its configuration, can never acquire those characteristics described by libertarians. Dennett counsels those who cannot believe something to "try harder": we could, then, presumably try harder to believe that we might be truly free and responsible. The determinist, after all, does something odd when they imagine themselves "accepting" determinism and "reject ing" libertarianism, having "weighed" the evidence. It is perhaps only the assumption that libertarians are unspeakably naive which prevents a careful consideration of what a caused acceptance of determinism could amount to—a noise, a cosmic echo. If there is a possible world in which material creatures are free in a libertarian sense then the Earth may be that world, and we may be those creatures. This is wholly sepa rate from claims regarding what creatures might do with their freedom: eat nuts under water, alleviate poverty and usher in universal peace, or write defences of "natural" divisions. Whether we are in fact this free creature is an unknowable. This thought experiment, though, creates a radically free creature standing outside of causation. But Dennett seems not only reconciled to our place as creatures constrained by biology, he fights for it to a degree which suggests an ideological motive. Dennett frequently flirts with the language of the divine. God therefore can be con ceived in ways "less concrete" and not "anthropomorphic" than is ordinarily thought, the "Universe itself' is thought by some the "Supreme Being", the "intelligence" or God necessary for a designed universe could be distributed and immanent in that universe, and so on (1995, pp. 18, 133, 176, 180, 514-515, 520). Dennett (1993a, p. 214) even defines a pattern as any regularity ".. .recognizable-in-principle by some observer or other up to and including what we might call the maximal observer: the whole universe considered as a potential observer". The similarity with our earlier account of Hegel's "geist" is marked. Why it should be only "probably" the case that we cannot pray to the "Tree of Life", or why "God" (rather than the devil or nothingness) should be "in the details", seems strange (1995, pp. 520-521): surely as naturalists we categorically cannot pray, and all that is in the details is more details. Equally strange is the conservatism inherent in Dennett's regrets over the loss of languages and cultures, and his understanding of Santayana's love of Catholic ritual (1995, pp. 514-515). Dennett wishes to say that the world may be ".. .absurd in the existentialist sense of the term: not ludicrous but pointless, and the assumption is a necessary condition of any non-question-begging account of purpose" (p. 153). But this (Hegelian) "purpose", this existential justifi cation, is based on an equivocation, the equivocation allowing Dennett to claim that an engineering perspective unites the "the central biological concept of function" and "the central philosophical concept of meaning" (1995, p. 185)—what something means is what it does, how it interconnects. Searle rightly stymies this. The heart has no "function" aside from the normative importance we attach to it, ".. .the only facts are brute, blind physical facts and the only norms are in us and exist only from our point of view" (in Dennett 1995, p. 399). It is, though, difficult to accept that the heart's "function" depends on a perspective, but only because we shrink from contemplating full-blown determinism. If an inertial universe passes through configurations implied in earlier configurations, then there are no "beating hearts", only the roaring aftermath of an explosion. We think of our hearts as not being falling debris either because we are truly free, and therefore hearts are not falling debris, or because our thoughts are &lt;?) Springer</page><page sequence="14">234 Inl J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 falling debris: very few self-defined determinists will stare into this abyss. This debris might fall in "objective" patterns, but only for subjects themselves not debris. We reject this on pain of granting yawning dogs physics qualifications: a dog might yawn the syllables of an equation, after all. Meaning and function only exist for us, and only if we can justify carving the universe in a way that separates us from natural causation. If the universe just is, then necessarily it is only. But for Dennett the extant is never only; it is to be defended, with the parts deriving their significance from the place they play in the (perhaps not geist-free) whole. In Rationality in Action Searle (2003, p. 271) suggests that some experiences might be characteristic of truly free creatures. Drinking a cup of coffee, or smelling a rose, we are conscious that it is we who are experiencing this, the experience is qualitative and it forms part of a world of experience. The knowledge that one's actions make an ongoing difference in the world, coupled with the knowledge of one's mortality, might also imply radical freedom: not Brook's "autobiographical memory" simpliciter(2000, p. 252), (which Dennett does ignore) but the knowledge that one's autobiography will stop. Dennett reacts vociferously to the suggestion by Fodor and Chomsky that con sciousness and free will are mysteries (Dennett 1995, pp. 381-382), determined that consciousness will not be "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" (Dennett 2000, p. 369). It is difficult to see the source of the heat; these are, after all (by anyone's account) opaquely complex phenomenon, as Seager says (2000, p. 95), ".. .perhaps [one of] the last areas where it remains possible to doubt the virtues of a naturalistic treat ment". Besides, Dennett concedes that his accounts are far from final. Consciousness Explained (1993b) is often dubbed "Consciousness Explained Away" (Ross 2000, p. 22), but Dennett is, of course, the source of the sharp remark in the work itself. There is, though, an explanation of Dennett's trenchant compatibilism, his Darwin ian account of morality, his dismissal of the significance of consciousness and of his conservative explication of the present. It is found in one of the oddest sections of Darwin's Dangerous Idea. Dennett describes Breughel's Fall of Icarus, and Auden's response to it, Musee des Beaux Arts. Icarus falls, and the world continues regardless. Dennett says, "This is our world, and the suffering in it matters, if anything does" (1995, p. 518). Such a remark might be typical of someone committed to advocating the most radical and selfless action imaginable. But in fact Dennett notes the chari table deeds which are the alternative to self-satisfaction, and suggests that we please ourselves by ".. .not tampering with some current "default" principles that virtually ensure that you will ignore all but the most galvanizing potential interruptions to your personal life..." (p. 509). After all, ".. .every day, while trying desperately to mind our own business, we hear a thousand cries for help.. .How on Earth could anyone prioritize that cacophony?" Instead, we make use of".. .an utterly "indefensible" set of defaults to shield our attention from all but our own current projects" (p. 510). Smart (2003, p. 59) claims that accepting that heredity and environment made us is a barrier to "callousness and indifference". This seems less than certain. Arguably Kant subscribed humans to both the phenomenal and the noumenal worlds to separate morality from natural motives, such as sybaritic pleasure. The suggestion must be that Dennett similarly subscribes humans so determinedly to the natural world for some motive. Indeed, we are doubly subscribed: we are invited to contemplate with equanimity a Laplacean universe, and also a Darwinian account of life as the operation &lt;£] Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 235 of an algorithm; mutation, plus natural selection. These two accounts are not mutually exclusive, but it is interesting to note the mental gymnastics required to hold them in the mind simultaneously. Every event of "natural selection" then becomes a merely apparent contest, implied by the configuration of the universe and the physical laws. We may find Hume's account of "cause" difficult, Darwin may represent [as Dewey suggested (Dennett 1995, p. 66)] a mental "stretcher", but the notion of a universe susceptible to two fundamental explanations seems almost unimaginable. Dennett (2000, p. 338) claims that the question . .could evolution have done otherwise.. .is divorced from classical determinism.. .in the free will debate..It is difficult to see how it legitimately can be, however. A parallel problem arises in explaining conduct generally. As Akins (2002, p. 227) says, from the interpretative intentional stance we can say . .neural content be damned...". After all, Dennett's position is that inten tions . .can exist as real patterns without having to be token identical to any billiard balls in the system of Humean causal relations [I]ntentions don't cause anything below their own level of abstracta..(Ross 2002, p. 291). But (conversely) deter minism means that whatever the neural content it was sufficient to produce everything seen from the intentional stance. Similarly, if micro-causal determinism obtains then Darwinian explanations are foolish shorthand arrived at by those denied the Lapla cean perspective which would have identified every rutting stag (and every rut) in the universe's first super-dense singularity. Dennett's pursuit of naturalism verges on the pantheistic, driven by a faith that whatever science and (importantly) scientism produces it cannot be contradictory because the truth is a priori consistent. But what results is an account of the natural world not only red in tooth and claw, but robbed of the agency which might make it otherwise. For of course, if the world is perpetually ill-divided then this must surely, in both the colloquial and the Dennettian sense, be natural. After all, had Icarus worked himself to death, rather than engineering a romantic plunge, the evidence is that the world would have cared even less. Dennett's account slides into a conservative ratio nalisation of the present: he seems guilty of what Hegel was suspected of. A naturalistic account of being in the world must surely be modest, and avoid both prescriptivism and also trenchant defences of the present. Hegel's account, understood aright, disempowers every aspiring theoretician. All that is left is the practice of our lives, in which everyman meets the philosopher as an equal. If Dennett wishes to maintain his metaphilosophical position he must cease his populism. If, alternatively, he suspects that the universe has produced something categorically separate from its blind processes, modesty dictates that he must also assume that it perhaps produced more of these creatures: perhaps billions of them. Conclusion Dennett faces two interconnected difficulties. Firstly, there is what seems to be an irre solvable contradiction between his account of the human condition and his own philo sophical practice. Secondly, his claims regarding what physical determinism would mean for us seem to involve a commitment to some form of deism, which sits badly with everything else he has to say about religiosity. &lt;£} Springer</page><page sequence="16">236 Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 To deal with the first of these; like Hegel, Marx and many others, Dennett is a process theorist. Man is to be understood as part of a process, rather than as an agent categori cally distinct from the natural world. Such a process might be driven by mutation plus natural selection, God's progress in the world, the motor of economic imperatives or something else. Such a process theory makes a near-placeholder of the individual. A theoretical commitment of this sort, however, is compatible with any position in the freewill/determinism debate. After all, regardless of metaphysical commitments it is surely correct that we are born, speak and (perhaps) write a little, and then die. All we have are our minds, and on almost anyone's account these are not entirely our own. A similar perspective often underpins the view taken of the specific practices into which humans are inducted. Oakeshott (1933/1985) conceived of all human experience in terms of "modes", such as history, science and philosophy. If all possible experience is located in such "modes" every human is dependent on these genres, which consti tute the human story. Kuhn (1996), of course, revolutionised the philosophy of science with his account of the dependence of individual scientists on the practice of science. Kuhn's revolutionary scientists (like Hegel's Christians) are essentially fortunate to live when they do; they might just as easily have been "normal" scientists, working hard at solving routine puzzles. Once man is subordinated to a process and to practices criticism takes on a partic ular character. Practitioners can certainly defend their activity from obvious mistakes, such as category errors. Within practices participants can also raise objections which are seen to be prima facie valid. Anything more than this, however, seems impos sible. If our practices are by far the better part of us science and philosophy must progress through the normal business of narrow claims, and equally narrow rebut tals. Practitioners must serve the activity, rejecting fraud and writing transparently, everyone subjecting themselves to the disciplinary standards, and ideally each caring not a jot whether the dialectical process results in the annihilation of their particular contribution. Of course radical and discontinuous change is possible in a world of process and practices. But these events are the result of the process, and as Kuhn says are ".. .not to be had for the asking" (1996, p. 34). We can theorise how revolutions take place, but we can only participate in them through participation in a world which existed before we appeared, will continue after our death and would scarcely have skipped a beat had we not been born. The "Hegelian" understanding of Christ's significance and "Einstein's" theory of relativity would have retained their content, but changed their titles, had these geniuses not been born: the world was pregnant with these revolutions. Dennett, unfortunately, seems to be neither a detached theorist nor a practitioner in a practice. For him our minds must be reconfigured, fundamental error is everywhere and entire practices are malfunctioning. The links between practices and the wider world are also not serving our interests, and so instrumental and manipulative writing is necessary. It is, of course, extremely difficult to see how someone who believes in practices and process, particularly someone who lauds science (the most variegated and yet disciplinary of practices), can write populist and cross-disciplinary works. Indeed Dennett most resembles, to use the term popularised by Rorty, the geisteshis toriker, the sage who tells the world what to think about itself. But if we accept what *fj Springer</page><page sequence="17">Int J Philos Relig (2012) 71:221-238 237 Dennett has to say about man's contingent dependency on the world this is not a role anyone can responsibly fulfil. Dennett's second difficulty arises from the claim that physical determinism might well apply throughout the universe and within our bodies, and that this would nev ertheless leave man competent and free. Anyone producing a fundamental theory of being must obviously ask themselves whether their own practice is consistent with their claims about the world. It is, after all, trite but true that any book which claims that humans cannot write books had best have a non-human author. The author who affirms the possibility of determinism makes a sign of "affirmation" which could not have been otherwise, given the universe's composition. This seems no act at all. Hobbes, with whom Dennett shares so much, faced this problem squarely, and it is instructive to see how he solved it. Galileo's notions of inertia and momentum had displaced the last vestiges of teleology in Hobbes's mind. This for Hobbes was literal physical displacement, although "unstudied men" cannot conceive of such a thing. But a physical impact, like that of Galileo's locutions on Hobbes's brain, can surely knock a good idea out of one's head, or put a bad one into it. Leviathan, in Dennett's vernacular Hobbes's "brainchild", would seem on the face of it to be a work of very uncertain worth. But as Hobbes says in Of Liberty and Necessity, all of the multitu dinous chains of cause and effect in the world (which include the chains connecting Hobbes and Galileo) join together ".. .in the first link God Almighty" (1654/1999, p. 20). It is no trivial fact that Hobbes devoted much of Leviathan to the nature of a Christian Commonwealth. Hobbes could give an account of his own theorising which was consistent with his account of being: the world is not God-forsaken. Dennett, like Hobbes, imagines that his brain may be inseparable from the grosser bodies in movement which comprise the inertial universe. Neurological events and the outward signifiers of these (spoken and written words) might be categorically indis tinguishable from tides and volcanic eruptions. The mechanisms of natural selection, and the theories of those who fancy they stand at its peak, then become reverberations. But Dennett also plainly believes that he can infer that he is a theorist from his own subjective experience of seemingly theorising: a remarkably Cartesian position for someone wedded to anti-Cartesianism. The key to understanding Dennett's view of determinism is perhaps found in one odd remark. Nietzsche's idea of a universe that eternally recurs is for Dennett . .the sickest idea that anybody ever had" (1995, p. 311). It is very difficult to see why a universe which recurs is more troubling to Dennett than the deterministic universe he contemplates with such equanimity, even enthusiasm. But then one remembers Dennett's scattered homage to Hegelianism, in the discussion of the possibility of a God immanent in the universe, and the universe as a possible observer. It is then hard to avoid the conclusion that Dennett thinks that something (or someone) not present in Nietzsche's schema gives life and motion to our universe. "God" is a problematic term for naturalists, but in an ecumenical spirit we can accept any word so long as we are clear about the characteristics of the referent. Dennett is indifferent to "the Ground of All Being". It is difficult to see how he could be similarly indifferent to, "That which ensures that a mere effect in a deterministic universe can meaningfully theorise its own cause", or "That of which everything else is a mere extension". If determinism applies universally it is this, perhaps unnameable Springer</page><page sequence="18">238 lnt J Philos Relig (2012)71:221-238 power, which underwrites Dennett's project and predestines him to write as he does. It would seem obvious that an account could and should be given of this, our alma mater. Perhaps Dennett is predestined to give one. References Akins, K. (1993).
