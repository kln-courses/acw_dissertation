"Gender," I responded. "You mean gender bias? she asked helpfully. "No, gender" I said. There ensued an awkward silence, then my sixteen-year-old nephew quipped, "There are men and there are women. What more is there to say? Short book. Both the awkward silence and my nephew's untroubled response can be understood as manifestations of what Harold Garfinkel called the "natural attitude" toward gender. The natural attitude encompasses a series of "un- questionable" axioms about gender, including the beliefs that there are two and only two genders; gender is invariant; genitals are the essential signs of gender; the male/female dichotomy is natural; being masculine or femi- nine is natural and not a matter of choice; all individuals can (and must) be classified as masculine or feminine - any deviation from such a classifi- cation being either a joke or a pathology. According to Garfinkel, the be- liefs constituting the natural attitude are "incorrigible" in that they are held with such conviction that it is nearly impossible to challenge their validity (1967, 122-28).

In the past decade, gender has become the central analytic concept in women's studies and indeed has been the focal point for the development of new interdisciplinary programs (gender studies) in colleges and universities across the United States. Although originally a linguistic category denoting a system of subdivision within a grammatical class, feminist scholars adopted the concept of gender to dis- tinguish culturally specific characteristics associated with masculinity and femininity from biological features (male and female chromosomes, hor- mones, as well as internal and external sexual and reproductive organs). Early feminist scholars used gender to repudiate biological determinism by demonstrating the range of variation in cultural constructions of femininity and masculinity. In more recent works, others use gender to analyze the social organization of relationships between men and women (Rubin 1975; Barrett 1980; MacKinnon 1987); to investigate the reification of human differences (Vetterling-Braggin 1982; Hawkesworth 1990; Shan- ley and Pateman 1991); to conceptualize the semiotics of the body, sex, and sexuality (de Lauretis 1984; Suleiman 1985; Doane 1987; Silverman 1988); to explain the distribution of burdens and benefits in society (Walby 1986; Connell 1987; Boneparth and Stoper 1988); to illustrate the microtechniques of power (de Lauretis 1987; Sawicki 1991); to illumi- nate the structure of the psyche (Chodorow 1978); and to account for individual identity and aspiration (Epperson 1988; Butler 1990). Discussions of gender in history, language, literature and the arts, edu- cation, the media, politics, psychology, religion, medicine and science, so- ciety, law, and the workplace have become staples of contemporary feminist scholarship. As research on gender proliferates, so does the tendency to assume that the meaning of gender is unproblematic. Different scholars use gender in markedly different ways, however. Gender has been analyzed as an attribute of individuals (Bem 1974, 1983), as an interpersonal rela- tion (Spelman 1988), and as a mode of social organization (Firestone 1970; Eisenstein 1979). Gender has been defined in terms of status (Lo- pata and Thorne 1978), sex roles (Amundsen 1971; Epstein 1971; Jane- way 1971), and sexual stereotypes (Friedan 1963; Anderson 1983). It has been conceived of as a structure of consciousness (Rowbotham 1973), as triangulated psyche (Chodorow 1978), and as internalized ideology (Bar- rett 1980; Grant 1993). It has been discussed as a product of attribution (Kessler and McKenna 1978), socialization (Ruddick 1980; Gilligan 1982), disciplinary practices (Butler 1990; Singer 1993), and accustomed</page><page sequence="3">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 651 stance (Devor 1989). Gender has been depicted as an effect of language (Daly 1978; Spender 1980); a matter of behavioral conformity (Amund- sen 1971; Epstein 1971); a structural feature of labor, power, and cathexis (Connell 1987); and a mode of perception (Kessler and McKenna 1978; Bem 1993). Gender has been cast in terms of a binary opposition, variable and varying continua, and in terms of a layering of personality. It has been characterized as difference (Irigaray 1985a, 1985b) and as relations of power manifested in domination and subordination (MacKinnon 1987; Gordon 1988). It has been construed in the passive mode of seriality (Young 1994), and in the active mode, as a process creating interdepen- dence (Levi-Strauss 1969, 1971; Smith 1992), or as an instrument of seg- regation and exclusion (Davis 1981; Collins 1990). Gender has been de- nounced as a prison house (Cornell and Thurschwell 1986) and embraced as inherently liberating (Irigaray 1985b; Smith 1992). It has been identi- fied as a universal phenomenon (Lerner 1986) and as a historically specific consequence of modemity's increasing sextialization of women (Riley 1988). Should this multiplicity of meaning be a source of concern to feminist scholars? Can one concept encompass such a vast terrain? Does deploy- ment of gender as an analytic category enhance our understanding of the various modes of oppression that circumscribe women's lives? A number of feminist scholars have recently raised questions about the utility of gen- der as an analytic category, although the multiplicity of meanings of the term has not been the focal point of their critique. Susan Bordo has iden- tified two currents fueling the emergence of a new "gender skepticism" (1993, 216). One current flows from the experiences of women of color and lesbian feminists who have suggested that the "multiple jeopardy" characteristic of their lives raises serious questions about the validity of gender generalizations. If gender is always mediated by race, class, eth- nicity, and sexual orientation, then an analytic framework that isolates gen- der or construes gender in terms of an "additive model" is seriously flawed and may serve only to mask the numerous privileges of white, heterosex- ual, middle-class feminists who have the luxury of experiencing only one mode of oppression (King 1988; Spelman 1988; Higginbotham 1992; Brewer 1993). The other current flows from postmodern criticism that depicts gender narratives as totalizing fictions that create a false unity out of heterogeneous elements. In addition to calling into question the binary opposition that fixes men and women in permanent relations of domi- nation and subordination, postmodern critics have also challenged the "ground" of the sex/gender distinction. If gender was devised to illuminate the social construction of masculinity and femininity and naively took the</page><page sequence="4">652 I Hawkesworth sexed body as given, then it has little to offer in a postmodern world that understands the body, sex, and sexuality as socially constructed. Acknowledging the importance of the issues raised by women of color, lesbian feminists, and postmodern feminists, several feminist scholars have offered a defense of feminist uses of gender, suggesting that a sophisticated conception of gender can incorporate the central points made by these critics. In an important and influential essay, Joan Scott defines gender as a concept involving two interrelated but analytically distinct parts. "Gender is a constitutive element of social relationships based on perceived differ- ences between the sexes, and gender is a primary way of signifying relation- ships of power" (1986, 1067). In explicating gender as a constitutive ele- ment of social relationships, Scott emphasizes that gender operates in multiple fields, including culturally available symbols that evoke multiple representations; normative concepts that set forth interpretations of the meanings of symbols; social institutions and organizations; and subjective identity (1067-68). According to Scott, gender is a useful category of anal- ysis because it "provides a way to decode meaning and to understand the complex connections among various forms of human interaction" (1070). Noting that gender is always contextually defined and repeatedly con- structed, Scott cautions that gender analysts must not replicate the mis- takes of early feminist accounts that credited gender as a universal causal force. On the contrary, gender analysts must seek a "genuine historiciza- tion and deconstruction of the terms of sexual difference" (1065). Scott demonstrates that problematic theoretical assumptions informing radical feminism, Marxist feminism, and psychoanalytic feminism gave rise to a variety of misapplications of gender as an analytic category, resulting in ahistorical analyses, oversimplified and reductive explanations, universal generalizations impervious to change in history, exclusive fixation on the "subject," and restrictive foci on the family or the household. Such flaws need not be endemic to gender analysis, however. Indeed, Scott argues that a self-critical deployment of gender analysis has provided and could provide meaningful explanations of historically and culturally specific rela- tions obtaining between individual subjects and modes of social organiza- tion. If feminist scholars examine "how things happened in order to find out why they happened" (1067), their analytic investigations will enable them to reverse and displace the binary and hierarchical construction of gender, refuting the naive belief that gender "is real or self-evident or in the nature of things" (1066). Sandra Harding has also advanced a defense of gender as an analytic category. "The fact that there are class, race, and cultural differences be- tween women and between men is not, as some have thought, a reason to</page><page sequence="5">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 653 find gender difference either theoretically unimportant or politically irrele- vant. In virtually every culture, gender difference is a pivotal way in which humans identify themselves as persons, organize social relations, and sym- bolize meaningful natural and social events and processes" (1986, 18). The very pervasiveness of gender requires systematic feminist analysis. Thus, Harding argues that feminists must theorize gender, conceiving of it as "an analytic category within which humans think about and organize their so- cial activity rather than as a natural consequence of sex difference, or even merely as a social variable assigned to individual people in different ways from culture to culture" (17). Recognizing that gender appears only in culturally specific forms in no way mitigates the force of gender analysis. On the contrary, gender as an analytic category illuminates crucial cultural processes. "Gendered social life is produced through three distinct pro- cesses: it is the result of assigning dualistic gender metaphors to various perceived dichotomies that rarely have anything to do with sex differences (gender symbolism); it is the consequence of appealing to these gender dualisms to organize social activity, dividing necessary social activities between different groups of humans (gender structure); it is a form of socially constructed individual identity only imperfectly correlated with either the reality or the perception of sex differences (individual gender)" (17-18). According to Harding, feminist investigations of gender symbol- ism, gender structure, and individual gender challenge the basic presuppo- sitions of the natural attitude, thereby helping to dispel essentialized iden- tities, while creating the possibility of a politics grounded in solidarities that cross the divisions of race, class, age, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. The defense of gender as an analytic category advanced by Scott and Harding suggests that the concerns of gender skeptics can be incorporated into a sophisticated conception of gender. Their defense also tends to mute concern about the multiplicity of meanings accorded gender in contempo- rary feminist scholarship, for they provide a coherent account of the in- tricate connections linking psyche to social organization, social roles to cultural symbols, normative beliefs to "the experience" of the body and sexuality. Indeed, they suggest that feminist research into such connections can undermine the mistaken beliefs informing the natural attitude. Thus their defense also provides a bridge linking feminist scholarship to femin- ist politics outside the academy. Feminist research designed to confound gender provides the analytic tools to loosen the strictures of the natural attitude and the oppressive social relations that the natural attitude legitimates. Are Scott and Harding correct about the potential of gender as an ana- lytic category? Can gender be deployed as an analytic tool that escapes (or</page><page sequence="6">654 I Hawkesworth dispels) the natural attitude? Can attention to the historicity of gender en- able feminists to avoid universal causal claims, grand narratives, and to- talizing accounts? How does the use of gender as an analytic category fit in with a thoroughgoing understanding of the social construction of the body? To explore these questions, this article investigates four efforts to theo- rize gender: Steven Smith's Gender Thinking (1992), Judith Butler's Gender Trouble (1990), R. W. Connell's Gender and Power (1987), and Suzanne Kessler and Wendy McKenna's Gender: An Ethnomethodological Approach (1978). These four works are the most ambitious efforts that I have found to theorize gender in ways that connect psyche, self, and social relations. They also represent some of the major methodological approaches (phe- nomenology, postmodern deconstruction, dialectical materialism, ethno- methodology) currently vying for the allegiance of feminist scholars. Each of these accounts casts itself as a systematic, feminist analysis of gender. Each examines the multiple domains of gender, ranging across cultural symbols, normative concepts, social institutions, and subjective identities. Each conforms to Scott's directive to focus on how in order to explain why gender works. Each starts from the premise that the body is socially consti- tuted and culturally mediated. And each advances arguments that chal- lenge fundamental presuppositions of the natural attitude. Emerging from and drawing upon different methodological traditions, each advances a markedly different account of gender. Yet, despite the diversity and rich- ness of these accounts, each also constructs a tale of gender that is mark- edly unsettling. I argue that despite important differences in their approaches to and their conceptions of gender, these works construct a narrative that impli- cates gender in "the ideology of procreation."' In so doing, these texts illuminate presuppositions that replicate rather than undermine the natural attitude. That such troubling presuppositions surface in accounts of gen- der that grow out of markedly different theoretical projects should be of concern to feminist scholars, for the presuppositions that structure this narrative of gender stand in stark contrast to the emancipatory project of feminist scholarship. Excavating the assumptions in these works, then, can help to identify the danger points in certain deployments of gender, dan- gers that arise in a subtle shift from using gender as analytic tool to attrib- uting to gender explanatory force.2 Interrogating the conceptual tools of 1 Michele Barrett defines the "ideology of procreation" as conceptions of sexuality that construe sexual behavior only in relation to reproduction (1980, 62-77). 2 I have learned a great deal from each of these insightful texts. Each helps clarify many assumptions about gender that surface in other works. I have selected these four texts, in part, because they illuminate a conflation of analytic category and explanation that is charac-</page><page sequence="7">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 655 feminist scholarship can help feminist scholars avoid these potential pit- falls. I offer this analysis in an effort to mark the dangers that lurk in certain uses of gender as a mode of explanation, rather than as an analytic category. Before turning to that task, I explore the meaning of gender as an analytic category and introduce a number of conceptual distinctions that may help make feminist claims about gender less confounding. Mapping the conceptual terrain What does it mean to use gender as an analytic category? Neither Scott nor Harding explicitly addresses this question, but both seem to use the term in a semitechnical sense drawn from the philosophy of science. In this sense, an analytic category can be understood as a heuristic device that performs both positive and negative functions in a research program (La- katos 1970). As a positive heuristic, gender illuminates an area of inquiry, framing a set of questions for investigation. Although it need not involve any explicit methodological commitment, gender as analytic tool identifies puzzles or problems in need of exploration or clarification and provides concepts, definitions, and hypotheses to guide research. By demonstrating in their own work the intricate interrelations of symbol systems, normative precepts, social structures, and subjective identities subsumed under gen- der's rubric, Scott and Harding invite other scholars to probe these diverse domains to discover how culturally specific gender relations are created, sustained, and transformed. The very notion of a positive heuristic is tenta- tive, suggesting a trial-and-error method of problem solving requiring the collective efforts of multiple scholars to advance the field. But the notion of a "negative heuristic" developed by Imre Lakatos suggests a shared set of assumptions so central to a mode of analysis that they cannot be jetti- soned (1970, 132). Given gender's original meaning in feminist discourse and the frequency with which feminist scholars reiterate this goal, the neg- ative heuristic of gender analysis could be "to contest the naturalization of sex differences in multiple arenas of struggle" (Haraway 1991, 131). The use of gender as an analytic category, then, would be intimately bound up with challenges to the natural attitude. The terminology developed within feminist discourses on gender teristic of many other feminist works. The recurrent attribution of explanatory force to gen- der in these markedly differing accounts suggests a need to interrogate the concept more thoroughly to see how to avoid this problematic move. In an article of this length, I cannot demonstrate that the narrative of gender that I trace in these four works is representative of a much larger current in contemporary feminist scholarship, although I believe this is the case. In my own reading of contemporary feminist research, I have found that many works present in compressed form the narrative of gender that these works develop in greater detail.</page><page sequence="8">656 I Hawkesworth certainly suggests the centrality of efforts to challenge the natural attitude. Feminist scholars have introduced a number of important distinctions to illuminate the complexity of gender: sex, sexuality, sexual identity, gender identity, gender role, gender-role identity. Virtually all scholars working in the field employ some of these distinctions, although all scholars do not use the terms in the same way. Sex, for example, can refer to the biological features such as chromosomes, hormones, internal and external sexual and reproductive organs, or to acts romantically characterized as lovemaking. Gender identity typically refers to the individual's own feeling of being a man or a woman, but this "feeling" may be defined in a rudimentary sense as having a conviction that one's sex assignment at birth was "anatomically and psychologically correct" (Stoller 1985, 11) or more expansively as a patterned subjectivity that bears some relation to cultural conceptions of masculinity or femininity.3 Although usage varies from text to text, most feminist scholars would grant that there are important conceptual differ- ences between sex construed in biological terms; sexuality understood to encompass sexual practices and erotic behavior; sexual identity referring to designations such as heterosexual, homosexual/gay/lesbian/queer, bisexual, or asexual; gender identity as a psychological sense of oneself as a man or a woman; gender role as a set of prescriptive, culture-specific expectations about what is appropriate for men and women; and gender-role identity- a concept devised to capture the extent to which a person approves of and participates in feelings and behaviors deemed to be appropriate to his or her culturally constituted gender.4 This terminology provides the analytic vocabulary that enables feminist scholars to challenge the natural attitude. Consider the distinction between gender identity and gender-role identity, for example, which admits of the possibility that one can have a clear sense of oneself as a woman (or a man) while being thoroughly disaffected from and refusing participation in prevailing conceptions of femininity (or mas- culinity). This distinction breaks any connection between masculinity/ femininity and sexed bodies, interpreting masculinity and femininity as culture-specific abstractions notoriously plagued by gender symbolism that mark a chasm between romanticized ideal and lived experience, attributed and actual, propaganda and practice. 3 It should be noted that "identity" can also mean markedly different things. It can mean a psychological sense of "who I am," a sociological notion of a person qua agent prior to assuming specific social roles, a Foucauldian concept that captures an array of regulatory practices that produce the internal coherence of the subject, a philosophical concern with the individuation and unity of a person in the face of change, or a narrative construction the individual develops to make sense of his or her life. 4 In developing these distinctions, I am drawing from Barrett 1980, 42-79, and Kessler and McKenna 1978, 7-11.</page><page sequence="9">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 657 Once feminists introduce conceptual distinctions that differentiate sex, sexuality, sexual identity, gender identity, gender role, and gender-role identity, then critical questions emerge: What do these phenomena have to do with one another? How are they related? How do their complex interrelations pertain to gender as lived experience? The natural attitude postulates sex as the determinant of gender identity that flows naturally into a particular mode of heterosexuality and that mandates certain rational gender roles embraced happily by individuals with uniformly positive gender-role identities. In keeping with the negative heuristic of gender as an analytic category, feminist scholars have challenged each of these posited relations. Drawing upon linguistics, historical analysis, structuralism, de- construction, Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, phenomenology, ex- istential and cognitive psychology, as well as dialectical materialism, femi- nists have advanced a variety of accounts not only of the relations that obtain among these diverse domains but also of how such complex social processes are naturalized. In the following section I examine four feminist accounts of the "facticity" of gender, which move from use of gender as an analytic category to an explanation of gender as lived experience. Complementarity models: Gender within a functionalist frame Gender initially existed as a grammatical category. Some attention to lin- guistics then may help illuminate the concept's appeal to feminist scholars. Etymologically, gender derives from the Latin,genus, via old French,gen- dre, roughly translated as "kind" or "sort." Designated "the most puzzling of grammatical categories,... genders are classes of nouns reflected in the behavior of associated words" (Corbett 1991, 1). Gender is puzzling for linguists precisely because it is not universal or invariant. In some lan- guages, gender is central and pervasive, while in others it is totally absent. Corbett's examination of more than two hundred languages revealed that "the number of genders is not limited to three; four is common, and twenty is possible" (1991, 5). As the proliferation of genders in specific languages makes clear, gender need not have anything to do with sex. "In some languages, gender marks the distinction masculine/feminine/non- sexed; but in other languages the divisions animate/inanimate, human/ non-human, rational/non-rational, male human/other, strong/weak, aug- mentative/diminutive, male/other, female/other function exactly as does the division into male/female" (30). As the etymology suggests, grammati- cal gender is based on a wide range of "kinds" including "insects, non-flesh food, liquids, canines, hunting weapons, items whose lustrous surfaces re- flect light. ... The worldview of the speakers determines the categories" (30-32). Given the enormous range of grammatical genders, the</page><page sequence="10">658 I Hawkesworth determining criterion of gender is agreement: genders are distinguished syntactically by the agreements they take. In some languages, adjectives and verbs show agreement, in others, adverbs, numerals, and even con- junctions agree; but, in all cases, agreement is the way in which the genders are reflected in the behavior of associated words (5).5 Gender's conceptual appeal for feminists is closely tied to its versatility in linguistics. As a linguistic construction, the cultural origins and historic- ity of gender are unmistakable. Gender's relation to the belief systems of determinate peoples frees it from the specter of biological determinism. Moreover, linguistic gender is not inherently enmeshed in binary opposi- tion. Yet there is another facet of gender's linguistic legacy that should give feminists pause. If feminists were to draw an explicit analogy from gram- matical gender, they would define genders as categories of persons consti- tuted in and through the behavior of associated others, emphasizing that the relevant behavior involves concord or harmony. Although this aspect of the grammatical heritage is seldom addressed explicitly in feminist ac- counts of gender, notions of agreement, harmony, and complementarity surface obliquely and problematically in numerous feminist accounts of gender. Indeed, a close reading of some of the most intricate and sophisti- cated recent accounts of gender reveals that notions of agreement or com- plementarity form the secret core of the authors' efforts to explain gender and to use gender to explain other social relations. Explanations of this sort situate gender in a functionalist frame. Within this frame, gender is depicted as a cultural construct devised to promote particular social func- tions that bear a marked resemblance to the presuppositions of the natu- ral attitude. Perhaps the most explicit version of this view can be found in Steven Smith's phenomenology of gender, Gender Thinking (1992). A philoso- pher steeped in the phenomenological tradition, Smith argues that an accu- rate analysis of gender must begin with an explication of the "life world," the fundamental structures of consciousness: "The first false move ... is the identification of gender with sex, or sex-as-socialy constructed, or sex role, when in fact ordinary talk of'feminine' and 'masculine' is not neces- sarily or even most often about any of these things but instead has to do typically with intentional qualities and indeed, ideals" (xiv). Thus Smith seeks to illuminate how gender operates in the life world. 5 It would be fascinating to explore the relations between agreement in adjectives, verbs, and adverbs in languages in which gender corresponds to sex for some insights into the origins of gender symbolism. Did the linguistic agreement reflect demeanors and roles as- cribed to men and women in traditional societies? Have certain descriptions, actions, and qualifications of actions come to seem sex specific due to grammatical agreement?</page><page sequence="11">S I G N S Spring 1997 1 659 Defining gender as a "conventional formation of a plastic humanity," Smith describes "gendering as a cultural process: a cultivation of human nature determined by the vicissitudes of early childhood and the customs of one's community" (15). Rather than invoking the metaphor of cultiva- tion to imply growth or development, Smith uses the term to convey the imposition of certain constraints on human potential. Thus he suggests that gendering "qualifies" our humanity. Indeed, it is one of two critical social forces that shape human potential. "Humanity is a generic nature that stands in two chains of mutually qualifying categories, one physical (which includes sex) and the other intentional (which incudes gender)" (23). Physical and intentional constraints admit of a range of differentia- tion, hence the phenomenon of individuality, but according to Smith, there are "limits to our plasticity, to the range of differentiations possible" (27). On Smith's view, "There are observable human phenomena that give definite shape to our openness" (25), and sex is perhaps the most powerful of these limits. "The sexes have the status of physical fact, almost always instantly and unproblematically ostensible" (46). Although he refers to "the sexes" as almost unproblematically ostensible, Smith acknowledges that culture shapes what is perceived as a body. Through "embodi- ment," "the community stipulates what counts as a male/female body, what life will be like in a male/female body in relation to other bodies, what norms (and latitudes) of character and conduct are associated with these bodies, and who is male and female" (91). When culture takes up the task of molding human nature, then, its aim is to enhance its own con- struction of what is naturally given, to mark sex differentiations through language, character, and roles. For this reason, gender always entails a "dual reference to sex and character for purposes of description and evalu- ation" (36). For Smith, language is paradigmatic of the cultural desire to mark sex differences. "In grammar, genders are sex-related systems of syntactical con- cord.... Human genders also work as systems of concord insofar as dis- tinctive ways of speaking and acting are assigned to persons of different sexes" (43; emphasis added). Smith's claim that grammatical gender is ex- clusively sex related enables him to suggest that the core content of the human gender system is not chosen but given. "Human gender schemes possess centers of meaning in (what are taken to be) sexed bodies" (44). Thus, cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity are not arbi- trary. They are rooted in sex, which in turn has its own "center of meaning rooted in reproduction: woman as egg producer; man as sperm producer" (46). Starting with an overly restrictive account of grammatical gender, Smith links gender to sex to reproduction, and hence, to heterosexuality.</page><page sequence="12">660 I Hawkesworth "Confronting sex differences makes me realize that I need a partner to reproduce.... A gendered being teams with other gendered beings" (71). Smith's claim that gender merely marks differences and meanings given by sexed bodies does not rest comfortably with his acknowledgment of how much work gendering involves. He notes that "we are continually subjected to gender attributions in all phases of our lives and that this gen- dering scheme has more orienting force for most of us, most of the time, than any other human differentiation" (36). Gender involves a "fundamen- tal shaping of selfhood" that produces not only differences in "attunement and appreciativeness" but "a normative solicitation of our intentions" and "an already granted permission to think, feel, act, and appear in ways that everyone does not and cannot" (53, 55, 184). Lifelong subjection to such gendering makes the experiences of the genders partly incommensurable. Smith suggests that gender both "marks the limit of comprehension" be- tween men and women and yet gives these gendered beings a reason to live together: "Gender's normative force consists of nothing other than its ability to answer the life-interpreting question of how intenders should live together" (53, cf. 56). Gender creates sex-specific experience and cog- nition, makes men and women mysteries to each other, and thereby in- culcates a desire for cohabitation. For it is the culturally constructed in- commensurability that enables men and women to regard each other as complementary (80). Hence, genders constitute "generic realities ... com- plementary kinds of a kind" (49, cf. 52). Why does culture engage in the double effort to differentiate bodies through embodiment and gendering? If the center of sexual meaning is unproblematically reproduction, why is this double effort necessary? Smith's response is reminiscent of Levi-Strauss. "Culture and gender are both normative organizations of intention binding the group together" (68). Gender as "a culturally-engineered central meaning with a culturally- influenced physical base" is necessary because certain "functions (e.g., childbearing and fighting) are necessary and require that our lives be sub- stantially adapted to them" (69, cf. 73). Underlying the cultural creation of complementarity is the species demand for survival. "Since men and women have significantly different reproductive risks and opportunities in evolutionary terms, their guiding sex-related emotions must be sex- differentiated, that is, there must be different female and male sexual na- tures" (124). In a somewhat bizarre inversion of sociobiological premises, Smith suggests that species reproduction requires sexual differentiation; therefore culture creates that differentiation in order to insure the perpetu- ation of the species but masks its role by attributing the original difference to sex itself. Hence, "heterosexuality's postulated union of male and female</page><page sequence="13">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 661 specializations is the basic premise of the gender system" (80). Returning to the theme of concord, Smith concludes his analysis by legitimating the cultural creation of difference with an appeal to a cassical conception of the "natural." "Gender dualizing is humanly natural, if nature means that which satisfies conditions of harmonious adjustment. The adjustment in question is humans to themselves. Because humanity is a social reality, it has to be balanced within itself; the category of complementarity is bound to be invoked in the self-interpretation of beings who form their own en- vironment.... Reciprocal dependency may take a number of forms, but duality is a preferred principle for elaborating such forms because of the nature of the problem of balancing" (247-48). From a feminist perspective, the shortcomings of Smith's account of the intricate connections between sex, sexuality, gender, and gender role are numerous. He develops an enormously complex phenomenological analy- sis of "gender thinking" only to vindicate the natural attitude. Like Levi- Strauss, Smith accepts a conception of culture as an elaborate mechanism devised to create interdependence and cooperation in the reproduction of the species. Yet culture's mission in inducing complementarity makes sense only if one presupposes an atomistic, asocial, or even antisocial conception of human nature, a conception with strong ties to capitalist ideology, but little validity as universal description. Smith tries to mask the inadequacy of his conceptions of culture and human nature by repeated references to sex construed in terms of "natural kinds," but none of the typical correlates of sex conform to the demands of that classification. A natural kind refers to a category that exists independent of the observer and that can be de- fined in terms of an essence, a set of properties common to all members of the kind. Feminist scholarship has repudiated the notion of any sexual es- sence precisely because "there are no behavioral or physical characteristics that always and without exception are true only of one gender" (Kessler and McKenna 1978, 1). Chromosomes, hormones, sperm production, and egg production, all fail to differentiate all men from all women or to pro- vide a common core within each sex. "No matter how detailed an inves- tigation science has thus far made, it is still not possible to draw a clear dividing line even between male and female" (Devor 1989, 1). If one moves from the natural sciences to the social sciences, efforts to identify behavioral differences that conform to the definition of a natural kind have again ended in failure. Attitudinal and behavioral "sex differences" attrib- uted to men and women are mired in gender symbolism. Indicators of "biologically based femininity" typically include interest in weddings and marriage, preference for marriage over career, interest in infants and chil- dren, and enjoyment of childhood play with dolls, while indicators of</page><page sequence="14">662 I Hawkesworth "biologically based masculinity" include high activity levels, self-assurance, and a preference for career over marriage (Devor 1989, 11-15; see also Con- nell 1987, 167-90; Tavris 1992). Psychological inventories of masculinity and femininity have fallen prey to the misogynist tendency to define socially valued traits as male (logical, self-confident, ambitious, decisive, knows way around world) and less valued characteristics as female (talkative, gentle, sensitive to others' feelings, interest in appearance, strong need for secu- rity) (Devor 1989, 32). Even with all the cultural bias built into such stud- ies, they have not been able to differentiate clearly men and women in the cultures that produced the inventories. "'Normal femininity' of the psy- chological test variety may actually be a rare commodity. In one study of college-aged females, only 15% of the heterosexual sample tested as femi- nine on a widely accepted sex role inventory. The remaining 85% scored as either masculine or as some combination of masculine and feminine" (15). Differences cast in terms of averages, tendencies, and percentages do not meet the criteria of a natural kind. Nor do such cultural character- izations of masculinity and femininity constitute clear manifestations of "complementarity." If gender is to be judged by the standard Smith sets for it, the creation of reciprocal dependence, then a great deal of contemporary evidence (divorce rates, out-of-wedlock births, levels of domestic violence, numbers of"deadbeat dads") suggests that it fails dismally in its mission. The main virtue of Smith's account is that it illustrates so graphically how gender, a category specifically devised to avoid biological determin- ism, covertly invokes the very biological ground it set out to repudiate. Smith's account, like the natural attitude itself, operates within the confines of a base/superstructure model of the sex/gender distinction (Connell 1987, 50; Laqueur 1990, 124). Within this model, the body is assumed to provide the raw material that culture can refine in various but limited ways. Gender is assumed to be "hard-wired, at least in part. The presumed naturalness (understood as the absence of force or coercion) of gender turns on that presumption of hardwiring. Thus, discussions of gender sel- dom move far beyond presuppositions concerning inherent sex differences. R. W. Connell has attempted to explain this recurrent problem in feminist accounts of gender by suggesting that in contemporary Western culture "the notion of natural sex difference forms a limit beyond which thought cannot go" (1987, 66). Similarly, Holly Devor describes biological deter- minism as the dominant cognitive schema in North America, that is, as the conceptual structure that organizes social experience on the basis of shared understandings (1989, 45-46). Mary Poovey (1988), Ludmilla Jordanova (1989), and Thomas Laqueur (1990) have provided fascinating accounts of the emergence of the base/superstructure model of gender since the sev-</page><page sequence="15">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 663 enteenth century. According to Laqueur, "It is a sign of modernity to ask for a single, consistent biology as the source or foundation for masculinity and femininity" (1990, 61). Whatever the cause of this tendency toward biologi- cal determinism, it is an impossible ground for feminist accounts of gender. As Smith's account makes clear, appeal to a biological ground traps gender in "the ideology of procreation," construing women in terms of an essential maternal role mandated by culture and nature - a role undifferentiated by race, ethnicity, age, class, sexual orientation, or any mode of individuality. Is there any escape from the base/superstructure model of the sex/gen- der distinction? Must feminist scholars incorporate functionalist assump- tions about culture in their conceptions of gender? Although references to limits beyond which thought cannot go and dominant cognitive schemas suggest quite pessimistic responses to these questions, attempts to locate the base/superstructure model of gender in the politics of modernity offer more optimistic possibilities. If this problematic conception of gender is rooted in modernity, then a postmodern feminist strategy specifically de- vised to abandon all binary oppositions should afford a conception of gen- der that escapes the traps of biological determinism. An examination of Judith Butler's complex and innovative analysis of gender in Gender Trouble (1990) may be instructive, then, revealing the prospects for a feminist con- ception of gender beyond the functionalist frame. Judith Butler's Gender Trouble sets out to explain how the "naturalness" of sex, sexuality, and gender are "constituted through discursively con- strained performative acts that produce the body through and within the categories of sex" (x). She cautions at the outset that "'being' a sex or a gender is fundamentally impossible" (19). The binary oppositions male/ female and masculine/feminine are incompatible with the continuous vari- ability of human characteristics, constructing a false opposition between the sexes and an artificial coherence within each term of the binary. Stereo- typical genders, then, must be understood as "ontological locales that are fundamentally uninhabitable" (146). Rejecting the "old dream of symme- try," Butler argues that gender must be understood, not as a noun, nor as a set of attributes, but as a "doing," a performance that constitutes the identity that it purports to be (24). According to Butler, gender is the process that constructs the internal coherence of sex, (hetero)sexual desire, and (hetero)sexual practice within the modern subject. It is the mechanism that produces a notion of a "pre- social body" shaped by culture. And, it provides the standard of intelligi- bility for persons that informs both the naturalistic paradigm and the authentic-expressive paradigm of the self. "Gender is the discursive/cultural means by which 'sexed nature' or 'a natural sex' is produced and established</page><page sequence="16">664 I Hawkesworth as 'prediscursive, prior to culture, a politically neutral surface on which culture acts" (7). Gender performs this work of naturalization through the "stylized repetition of actions through time" (141). The natural attitude is produced through the repetition of words, acts, and gestures. The sheer weight of these repetitions leads the actor to believe in the "naturalness" of the body and of heterosexuality and to act in conformance with "nature's dictates." Gender functions, then, as a regulatory fiction, "a fabrication, a fantasy instituted and inscribed on the surface of bodies" (136). Becoming gendered is a laborious process, bringing the self into belief in the natural attitude is arduous; yet the intensity of effort and the power relations that produce this effect are hidden by the very naturalization at the core of the gendering process. Butler's account reverses the direction of causality presumed by the nat- ural attitude: "gender designates the apparatus of production whereby sexes are established" (7). But Butler insists that gender itself is the effect of specific formations of power, of institutions, practices, and discourses that establish and regulate its shape and meaning. What are the practices that produce gender? Butler identifies phallogocentrism and compulsory heterosexuality as the discursive sites that produce gender. "The heterosex- ualization of desire requires and institutes the production of discrete and asymmetrical oppositions between 'feminine' and 'masculine' understood as expressive attributes of 'female' and 'male"' (17). Like Smith, Butler appeals to the cultural creation of complementarity qua heterosexuality as the ultimate explanans of gender. Her route to this conclusion, however, is markedly different, relying upon a critical rereading of Freud and Lacan. The incest taboo plays a central role in psychoanalytic accounts of the individual's relation to culture/civilization. It has been advanced as an explanation of the cost that civilization exacts from individuals in return for life-enhancing artifacts, as an explanation of the primary repression through which the individual enters culture, and as an explanation of the formation of gender identity. Butler suggests that the incest taboo itself naturalizes heterosexuality and masculine sexual agency. Through a close reading of Freud's discussion of the sexual dispositions that frame the oedi- pal conflict, Butler demonstrates that the incest taboo that fuels the oedipal conflict makes no sense without a prior prohibition of homosexuality. On Butler's reading, Freud's "polymorphous perversity" itself turns on a trun- cated conception of bisexuality. "The conceptualization of bisexuality in terms of dispositions, feminine and masculine, which have heterosexual aims as their intentional correlates, suggests that for Freud bisexuality is the coinci- dence of two heterosexual desires within a single psyche. ... Within Freud's thesis</page><page sequence="17">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 665 of primary bisexuality, there is no homosexuality, and only opposites at- tract" (60-61; emphasis in original). The absence of homosexuality in Freud's account attests to the power of culture's original prohibition. Cul- ture produces two prohibitions that regulate the shape and meaning of sexuality: the first is the taboo against homosexuality and the second is the incest taboo. "The prohibitive law both produces sexuality in the form of 'dispositions' and appears disingenuously at a later point in time to trans- form these ostensibly 'natural' dispositions into culturally acceptable struc- tures of exogamic kinship" (64). Butler notes that the law qua prohibition is also productive: it creates that which it prohibits. Thus homosexuality and bisexuality cannot be understood as either "before" or "outside" cul- ture, for they too are constructed within the terms of the constitutive dis- course. "If the incest taboo regulates the production of discrete gender identities, and if that production requires the prohibition and sanction of heterosexuality, then homosexuality emerges as a desire which must be produced in order to remain repressed. In other words, for heterosexuality to remain intact as a distinct social form, it requires an intelligible concep- tion of homosexuality and also requires the prohibition of that conception in rendering it culturally unintelligible" (77). Butler's account of the formation of gender identity illustrates the com- plex relations of prohibition, production, and naturalization. Drawing on Freud's notion of melancholia, a process of identification through which the ego incorporates attributes of a lost loved one to minimize the pain of the loss, Butler construes gender identity as a kind of melancholia. The incest taboo's prohibition of the maternal body triggers an identification with the prohibited object. Abjuring the language ofinternalization, Butler suggests the process of identification is better understood as a mode of incorporation or "encrypting." As a technical psychological term, incorpo- ration refers to an "antimetaphorical activity [that] literalizes the loss on or in the body and so appears as the facticity of the body, the means by which the body comes to bear 'sex' at its literal truth. The localization and/or prohibition of pleasures and desires in given 'erotogenic' zones is precisely the kind of gender-differentiating melancholy that suffuses the body's sur- face" (68). The incest taboo's prohibition produces gender identity as a process that minimizes loss through identification's complex disavowal of loss. The systematicity of this disavowal erodes the conditions of meta- phorical signification resulting in encrypting, a literalizing fantasy that deadens the body, even as it masks its genealogy, producing a body experi- enced as "natural fact." Becoming a gender is becoming naturalized. The taboo against homosexuality in conjunction with the taboo against incest</page><page sequence="18">666 I Hawkesworth differentiate bodily parts and pleasures on the basis of gendered meanings, as melancholia deadens some organs to pleasure and brings others to life (68-70). Butler's psychoanalytic account accords primacy to compulsory hetero- sexuality both as an explanation of culture's production of complemen- tarity and as an explanation of gender's production of a naturalized body. Where Smith endorses cultural mechanisms that "harmonize" human rela- tions and foster social integration, Butler denounces the modes of power that produce homosexuality as necessary, yet prohibited; within culture, yet marginalized. Butler is careful to note that homosexual/heterosexual is itself a problematic discursive formation, a binary relation premised upon a false opposition and a fraudulent unity within each term of that binary. Indeed, in criticizing Monique Wittig's radical disjunction between homo- sexuality and heterosexuality, Butler insists that there are "structures of psy- chic homosexuality within heterosexual relations, and structures of hetero- sexuality within gay and lesbian sexuality and relationships" (121).6 And in criticizing Lacan, Butler cautions against totalizing conceptions of iden- tity that follow from too efficacious and univocal a conception of the Law. She calls instead for a recognition that "multiple and coexisting identifica- tions produce conflicts, convergences, and innovative dissonances within gender configurations which contest the fixity of masculine and feminine placements with respect to the paternal law" (67). The very possibility of such multiple identifications is central to Butler's strategy for confounding gender. Arguing that power can never be escaped, only redeployed, Butler endorses parody as a tactic designed to subvert "the real" or the "sexually factic'. Strategies of subversive repetition can dispel belief in the illusions of the "natural" body/desire/sexuality, thereby rendering gender incredible (141, 146). As a postmodern critic, Butler's genealogy of gender is designed to probe what is left out of discursive formations that construe sex/gender/ desire as natural. She points out that homosexuality as a legitimate mode of sexuality is omitted from naturalistic accounts. Given the pervasiveness and persistence of the natural attitude, it makes sense to attribute its pro- duction to powerful cultural forces. In Butler's analysis, gender as per- formativity becomes the cultural force that produces belief in the natural- ness of heterosexuality. Gender is no longer an analytic tool used to illuminate a variety of asymmetries in culture but, rather, the process that 6 In the third chapter of Gender Trouble, Butler develops an analysis of Wittig's corpus, suggesting that certain problematic assumptions concerning the disjuncture between hetero- sexual and homosexual surface in Wittig's major theoretical essays (1980, 1981, 1985, 1992).</page><page sequence="19">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 667 naturalizes and justifies a particular asymmetry. The "effect of compulsory heterosexuality," gender reproduces a "natural" heterosexual world. Why does gender act as such a helpful handmaiden of her progenitor (rather than as a rebellious adolescent)? Butler's response is telling: "Be- cause gender is a project which has cultural survival as its end, the term strategy better suggests the situation of duress under which gender perfor- mance always and variously occurs. Hence, as a strategy of survival within compulsory systems, gender is a performance with clearly punitive conse- quences" (139). Butler's first formulation casts gender in the service of cultural survival. This does not explain why gender performs its designated cultural function, it merely redescribes the function. The second formula- tion, gender as a strategy of survival within a compulsory system, suggests that gender must perform its function to avoid punishment, a punishment presumably imposed by culture. But why does culture insist upon hetero- sexuality? In a discourse that explicitly eschews any sociobiological expla- nation, the options seem to be limited to either a simple notion that culture is a self-replicating system (begging the question of the origin of the cul- tural preference for heterosexuality) or a Freudian notion that renunciation of homosexual desire is the sublimation that civilization demands. The first option follows from Butler's characterization of gender as performativity, yet it has conservative implications Butler is unlikely to embrace. Butler defines performativity as repetition of words, acts, gestures. This definition is virtually indistinguishable from J. G. A. Pocock's conception of tradi- tion, "an indefinite series of repetitions of an action" introduced both to vindicate the authority of tradition and to eliminate unhelpful and poten- tially destabilizing queries about origins (1973, 237). Such a conservative project is diametrically opposed to Butler's stated objectives as a genealo- gist. If Butler's account of gender is not to fall prey to a static conception of cultural self-replication, then her appeal to "cultural survival" must be interpreted in a Freudian vein. Sexuality is offered as the explanans of culture. Butler's analysis drives a wedge between sex and sexuality, thereby avoiding biological determinism. The belief that sexuality "follows" from sex can be understood only as a relation of political entailment. But what is required to understand culture as "following" from compulsory hetero- sexuality? Can all of culture's complex domains plausibly be construed as emanating from or mandated by compulsory heterosexuality? Butler tends to conflate culture with phallogocentrism, thereby privileging the Sym- bolic system over science, industry, engineering, or other more palpable cultural constructs. Phallogocentrism captures feminist concerns about male domination in history and culture, but it does so at an exacting cost.</page><page sequence="20">668 I Hawkesworth For by construing culture in terms of a Symbolic system that itself privi- leges the Phallus, Butler perpetuates women's invisibility, underestimating their role as cocreators of culture and miring them in victimization. Phal- logocentrism fails to provide a sufficiently exhaustive account of culture. Moreover, it indulges a form of anthropomorphism that sustains discus- sions of what might be called the "cunning of culture,"7 the ingenious means by which culture insures its own survival through the production of organizational practices and structures independent of the needs or in- tentions of individuals. Such a reification makes culture appear at once omniscient, seamless, and unassailable, a markedly unhelpful point of de- parture for those aspiring to feminist transformation. There is also a certain irony in Butler's positing of compulsory heterosexuality as the explanans of culture. Foucault cautioned against the trap of conceiving sex (qua sex- uality) as the secret of being, suggesting that such beliefs implicate the subject in ever deeper modes of subjugation. It is unlikely that Butler's Foucauldian gesturing toward sexuality as the secret of culture can escape that trap. What does Butler's discursive construction of gender leave out? By in- terpreting gender in terms of the cultural production of heterosexual desire and psychoanalytic production of gender identity, Butler's account makes gender too much a matter of the self- a self that appears peculiarly un- marked by race, class, or ethnicity. Her account privatizes gender, re- stricting the utility of the concept. Butler's conception offers little prospect for unraveling gender symbolism or for addressing gender structures be- yond the psyche. The operation of gender in social, political, and economic institutions disappears as the psychodrama of the desiring self is played out. This occlusion of gender as an organizational feature of social life that is itself mediated by race and class may explain why Butler's reliance on parody as a transformative mechanism rings so hollow. While parody might help subvert the naturalization of desire, it is unlikely to make in- roads against the economic and political forces that circumscribe wom- en's lives.8 71 am extrapolating from the notion of the "cunning of reason." For a full explication of this concept see Tucker 1974, 269-95. 8 Judith Grant has questioned the subversive potential of parody: "One cannot simply subvert gender rules by inverting them.... Lots of people rebel, but it does not always get taken up as a rebellion ... Truly transformative rebellion involves several interpretive moments" (1993, 177-78). Butler herself has moved away from optimism about parody. In Bodies ThatMatter, Butler analyzes drag as "hyperbolic conformity" to gender imperatives that can "reveal the hyperbolic status of the norm itself," but goes on to note that "these norms, taken not as commands to be obeyed, but as imperatives to be 'cited' twisted,</page><page sequence="21">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 669 Butler's postmodern account of gender succeeds in escaping biological determinism, but it still proffers a functionalist explanation of gender. Moreover, in positing heterosexuality as the explanans of culture, Butler's account of gender comes far too close to Smith's for comfort, for allusions to compulsory heterosexuality do nothing to dispel the ideology of repro- duction that sustains the natural attitude. Despite the virtuosity of Butler's account of gender as performativity, it does not provide a conception of gender that breaks definitively from the problematic presuppositions of the ideology of procreation. R. W Connell's Genderand Power (1987), which blends strains of Marx- ism, existentialism, and poststructuralism in developing its account of gen- der, is richly deserving of close examination. Connell advances a "system- atic social theory of gender" that strives to account for the historicity of gender; the dynamic role of gender in economic, political, sexual, and psy- chological domains; and the relation between personal agency and social structure in gender formation and reproduction, as well as the turbulence and contradictions pertaining to gender as lived experience. Attuned to the problems associated with conceptions of gender that construe women as perennial victims, Connell develops a "practice-based" theory of gender attentive to both the constraining power of gender and the myriad strug- gles people engage in against those constraints. In addition, Connell pro- vides a cogent critique of all modes of biological determinism. Noting that the body is never experienced without cultural mediation, he defines gen- der in terms of the cognitive and interpretive practices that "create, appro- priate, and recreate reproductive biology" (79). According to Connell, gender as a social practice is more than a mere marking of the human body, "it is the weaving of a structure of symbols which exaggerate and distort human potential" (79). Repudiating various versions of mind/body dualism, Connell insists that "the practical transfor- mation of the body in the social structure of gender is not only accom- plished at the level of symbolism. It has physical effects on the body, the incorporation is a material one" (87). Connell is also careful to point out that the social practices constituting gender bear no direct relation to what might be considered "functional" for human reproduction. The patterns of posture, movement, dress, adornment, body shape, body image, sexuality, intonation, speech, skilling, and de-skilling associated with cultural con- structions of masculinity and femininity may not be at all conducive to reproduction. Arguing that the "logic" that drives gender is autonomous, queered, brought into relief as heterosexual imperatives, are not, for that reason, necessarily subverted in the process" (1993, 237).</page><page sequence="22">670 I Hawkesworth Connell rejects all theories that attempt to derive gender from natural differences, biological reproduction, the functional needs of society, or the imperatives of social reproduction. Indeed, he insists that functionalist ar- guments must be viewed with extreme suspicion: they serve only to mask the power underlying these cultural symbolizations in order to justify in- equitable distributions of social burdens and benefits. In developing his account of the historicity of gender, Connell delin- eates a conception of human practices in relation to social structures in- formed by the works of Marx and Sartre. On this view, practices are the daily actions of human beings who appropriate and transform nature in order to satisfy their needs and in the process transform themselves, pro- ducing new needs and new practices. Practices are inherently dynamic transformations of the natural world that open up new possibilities as well as new risks and pressures. Practices can also become solidified, en- trenched, and institutionalized, creating a degree of intractability in the social world that limits the freedom of future practices. Connell defines social structure in terms of such limits. A social structure is a pattern of constraint on practice inherent in social relations. Operating through the complex interplay of power and institutions, "'structure' specifies the way practices (over time) constrain practices" (95). Although structures mark the fixity of the social world, the sedimentation of past practices that limit present action, the dimension of collective life that exists beyond individual intention, they are not impervious to change. "Practice can be turned against what constrains it; so structure can deliberately be the object of practice. But practice cannot escape structure, cannot float free of its cir- cumstances" (95). According to Connell, gender can best be understood as an interrelated set of social structures that define men and women in terms of their reproductive role and organize social life around sex and sexuality. On this view, gender is far more than an attribute of an individual or a characteristic of a social collectivity, it is the active process that reduces people to, and conceives social life in terms of, reproductive function, thereby constraining individual potential (97, 140, 245). Taking issue with feminist accounts that construe gender structure in terms of a monolithic male domination, Connell argues that gender must be conceived in terms of very specific structures tied to particular social practices of labor, power, and cathexis. He insists that gender is not an "ideological addendum" to social structures rooted in race or class but, rather, an autonomous structure constitutive of these fields. As a constraint upon labor, gender structures the allocation of particular types of work, the organization of domestic activity, the division of paid versus unpaid labor, the segregation of labor markets, patterns of production and con-</page><page sequence="23">S I G N S Spring l997 I 671 sumption, wage levels, opportunities for employment and promotion, and even the conditions and terms of labor exchange. Within the domain of power, gender structures authority, control, and coercion, establishing hierarchies in public and private sectors, creating a virtual male monopoly on institutional and interpersonal violence, and promoting particular modes of domestic and sexual asymmetries. Defining cathexis in terms of practices constructing emotionally charged relations with others, Connell notes that gender structures identities of desiring subjects and designation of desirable objects, patterns of desire, and sexual practices, as well as terms and conditions for sexual exchange. Connell notes that these diverse gender structures exist in complex in- terrelationship but insists that it is a mistake to characterize that relation- ship as either a logical or systemic unity. Even the notion of a "historical unity" tends to convey more coherence and internal consistency than may exist, masking tensions, uneven developments, and internal contradictions among these structures that can precipitate crises crucial to their transfor- mation. Connell prefers the term historical composition to capture the human agency that creates the imperfect and incomplete orderliness linking di- verse gender structures. As a historical composition, gender is "a linking concept. It is about linking other fields of social practice to modal practices of engendering" (140). Its central tools are the principles of separation, division, and unequal integration (97). Human agency is essential to the creation and transformation of gender, yet the natural attitude sees gender as fixed by nature. Connell suggests that the apparent fixity of gender structures is maintained by "sexual ideol- ogy." Describing his approach to sexual ideology as "more akin to the soci- ology of knowledge than to contemporary theories of discourse," Connell suggests that ideology must be understood as "a practice, ontologically on a par with other practices and equally involved in the constitution of social interests" (244-45). Connell identifies two fundamental practices consti- tutive of sexual ideology, naturalization and cognitive purification. Natu- ralization collapses social structure into nature in order to legitimate social practices and insulate them from change. "Naturalization is not a naive mistake about what biology can or cannot explain. At a collective level, it is a highly motivated ideological practice which constantly overrides biological facts" (246). Cognitive purification involves the production of ideological representations devoid of any of the messy complexity of lived relations. Shallow stereotypes, romantic narratives, and "squeaky clean" sociobiological images of women as nurturers and men as providers, are the stock-in-trade of cognitive purification. Gender and Power presents a remarkably insightful and systematic analy-</page><page sequence="24">672 I Hawkesworth sis of gender. Like Smith and Butler, Connell moves from a description of gender as analytic category to an account of gender as an active process structuring multiple domains of social life. He offers a modest justification for his approach: "This framework is serviceable for understanding current history" (97). He might also have said that his theory accounts for virtually every feminist usage of gender over the past several decades and relates them in a multilayered whole. At the level of conceptualization, however, there is some slippage in his theorization of gender. For Connell, gender is the process that relates all the rich and varied levels of human activity to biological reproduction. It is an active force that makes people think constantly in terms of sex. And it is precisely this reductionism that enables gender to constrain so many dimensions of social organization. Yet, when Connell so deftly identifies the gender structures operative in the domains of labor and power, it is not at all clear that they gain their force by dragging the mind back to reproductive biology. Do women really earn less because they are capable of bearing children? Does gender make us think so? Is job segregation in clerical work, fast-food industries, secondary education, or nursing really related to women's gestational ability? Are women subjected to domestic violence because of their reproductive role? Connell notes that "the practices of sexual reproduction are often quite remote aspects of social encounters in which gender is constructed and sustained" (81). But if this is so, how does gender work? Connell intro- duces Sartre's distinction between a practico-inert series and an intention- ally mobilized group to explain gender's operative mechanisms. According to Sartre, a series is a mode of collective unity structured by external social or material circumstances, or what might be called the "logic of the situa- tion." Because the commonality that unites the series is imposed by exter- nal objects or the actions of others, seriality is passive, implying no con- scious awareness on the part of those who make up the series. Sartre used the example of people waiting for a bus to illustrate his conception of the series: they have certain things in common by virtue of their situation, even though they may not be consciously aware of any common ties. In contrast, a group is a collection of persons who consciously acknowledge a bond uniting them, whether it be a collective identity, a common project, or shared values. According to Connell, sex can be understood as a series. The biological differentiation of men and women in reproduction imposes an external logic upon individuals on the basis of a parallel situation. Thus women share a passive commonality by virtue of their reproductive capacity, as do men. In keeping with Sartre's description of seriality as practico-inert (i.e.,</page><page sequence="25">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 673 a product of human action that constrains), Connell notes that construing sex as a series does not imply any awareness of the postulated commonality, any incorporation of the seriality into one's identity, or any identification with those others who share the situation. By describing gender in terms of a Sartrean group, Connell suggests that gender's task is to create a con- scious awareness of reproductive capacity as the basis for solidarity. "To construct the social category 'man' or 'woman' with a common identity and interest, requires a negation of the serial dispersion characteristic of the array of parallel situations constructed by biological categories. This is done in practices that create and assert the solidarity of the sex (or of a group within it)" (81, cf. 137). For gender to accomplish its mission, then, it must negate the passive experience of the body and create a notion of commonality embraced by members of the group, thereby mobilizing women and men as distinctive groups. But how can gender simultaneously negate the biological ground of the series and mobilize reproductive biol- ogy as the basis of a shared identity? And if certain social expectations about the sexed body constitute sex as a practico-inert series, structuring the logic of situation in terms of reproduction, how does gender differ from those initial social expectations?9 The sex/gender distinction seems to collapse into a vortex of reproduction. Sartre conceives of the group as a collection of persons whose conscious awareness of shared characteristics serves as the basis for united action, for the initiation of a collective project. But Connell's conception of gender cannot begin to carry men and women that far, for he explicitly acknowl- edges the deficiencies of any construction of men and women as internally undifferentiated categories. And he is keenly aware of the social cleavages rooted in race, class, ethnicity, age, and homophobia that preclude any collective identification, much less collective action. Thus the group/series explanation of how gender accomplishes its work founders both in its ac- count of sex as series and in its account of gender as group. And despite Connell's numerous caveats, it appears to accord primacy to reproduction in cultural constructions of sex, as well as gender. The limitations of Connell's attempt to define gender as a process link- ing diverse fields of social relations to reproductive biology also surface in his discussion of sexual ideology. It is not at all clear how gender differs from sexual ideology. Both are described as cognitive and interpretive prac- tices, as symbolizations that naturalize social constructions and impose 9 Without addressing Connells use of Sartre's conception of seriality, Iris Young presents cogent reasons for treating gender as a series, not as a mechanism for transcending seriality (1994).</page><page sequence="26">674 I Hawkesworth untenable sex distinctions on men and women. Is gender, after all, a matter of belief more than a structure of social forces? In what precise ways does it differ from sexual ideology? Connell uses sexual ideology to discuss liter- ature, film, and modes of cultural production that do not fit into his cate- gories of labor, power, and cathexis. But if we are to take seriously his discussions of the role of beliefs in constituting social practices and his rejection of simplistic base/superstructure models, what is the purpose of the distinction between gender and sexual ideology? In devising a concep- tion of sexual ideology "akin to the sociology of knowledge," Connell is able to discuss the role (conservative vs. radical) of intellectuals in ideologi- cal production and to introduce a conception of social interests (male hege- monic) served by naturalization. Both of these moves allow Connell co- vertly to introduce functionalist premises that he had explicitly renounced earlier in his analysis. Connell offers several functionalist speculations about why belief in gen- der persists despite all the philosophical arguments and scientific evidence that demonstrate the defects of the natural attitude. "There is a logic to paradoxes such as gross exaggerations of difference by social practices of dress.... They are part of a continuing effort to sustain the social defini- tion of gender, an effort that is necessary precisely because the biological logic, and the inert practice that responds to it, cannot sustain gender cate- gories" (81). But if gender is doing its cultural work successfully, what explains the perceived necessity to shore up gender? Connell's account is startling: "The solidarity of the heterosexual couple is formed on the basis of some kind of reciprocity rather than on the basis of common situation or experience.... Sexual difference is in large part what gives erotic flavor to relationships. It is emphasized as a means of heightening and intensi- fying pleasure, hence, the systematic exaggeration of gender differences" (113). Despite the enormous complexity of Connell's account, despite his repeated cautions against functionalist explanation, the complementarity thesis undergirds his analysis. It provides the fundamental explanation of why gender persists. Connells book is remarkably sensitive to heterosexism, but the notion that "sexual difference" heightens erotic pleasure depends on heterosexist presuppositions. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (1990) has pointed out that the heterosexual/homosexual opposition allows equivocation in the meaning imputed to "homo"/sexual. As one moves from notions of one sex, to same sex, to selfsame, to sameness, an enormous range of differences is elided. And this elision sustains Connells assumption that there is greater differ- ence, hence greater potential erotic pleasure, across genders than within genders. "The new calculus of homo/hetero ... owes its sleekly utilitarian</page><page sequence="27">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 675 feel to the linguistically unappealable classification of anyone who shares one's gender as the 'same' as oneself, and anyone who does not share one's gender as Other" (Sedgwick 1990, 160). But Sedgwick points out that even the most cursory examination of human beings will reveal that being of the same gender cannot guarantee "similarity" anymore than being of "opposite" genders can guarantee difference. Moreover, the belief that the gender of one's sexual partner is the crucial difference determining pleasure (rather than differences pertaining to positions, acts, techniques, zones or sensations, physical types, symbolic investments, relations of power, etc.) does not withstand serious scrutiny. Thus, there appears to be a suppressed procreationist premise in Connell's allusion to the best means to heighten erotic pleasure. Once again, the "cunning of culture" seems to insert a pro- creationist agenda into an explanation of gender. Connells attempt to describe gender as a reductionist process linking divergent social fields to sexual reproduction does not adequately account for all the modes of injustice women experience, although it certainly iden- tifies a wide range of feminist concerns. Ultimately it founders on the com- plementarity thesis as the rationale for the cultural imposition of gender. No longer in the service of species or cultural survival, Connell's appeal to complementarity serves hedonistic ends. Gender is posited as a mechanism for heightening the intensity of pleasure. But whether the function attrib- uted to gender is the production of heterosexuality or erotic pleasure, func- tionalist explanation leads feminists to a dead end, for feminists theorizing gender within a functionalist frame cannot escape the spectre of biological determinism or the ideology of reproduction. Once again an insightful deployment of gender as analytic category slips into problematic claims about gender as explanans. In a remarkable and insightful approach to the study of gender, Suzanne Kessler and Wendy McKenna attempt to bracket ontological claims about gender in order to explore gender attribution, the instantaneous process by which one person classifies another as a man or a woman. Their explicit goal in Gender: An EthnomethodologicalApproach (1978) is to explain how gender attribution works. Their exposition of how the process operates does, however, sustain certain speculations about the larger question "why." Kessler and McKenna begin their investigation by noting several factors concomitant to gender attribution: the urgency that governs gender attri- bution in daily life (people feel they need to know whether they are inter- acting with a man or woman, boy or girl), the conviction that every indi- vidual can be categorized as a man or a woman, and the uneasiness that surrounds "ambiguous" cases. Linking the "need" to classify people by</page><page sequence="28">676 I Hawkesworth gender to the natural attitude, Kessler and McKenna provide a comprehen- sive demonstration that the assumptions informing the natural attitude are systematically flawed. Yet, they note that the fact that the natural attitude rests upon a number of mistaken beliefs in no way mitigates its hold. On the contrary, each time particular beliefs informing the natural attitude are refuted, new ones seem to replace them. Thus, they note that the absence of any physical or behavioral grounds for a dichotomous classification of men and women has led to the emergence of a new "scientific" concern with gender identity, the individual's psychological sense of being a male or a female, as a firmer foundation for a "fixed dichotomy." "Transsexual is a category constructed to relieve ambiguity, to avoid the kinds of combi- nations (male genitals and female gender identity) that make people un- comfortable because they violate basic rules about gender. Since genitals can now be changed, gender identity is now seen as a less flexible criterion; thus marking the triumph of surgeons over psychotherapists in the rush to restore gender to unambiguous reality" (120). What fuels this incessant replenishing of the natural attitude? Kessler and McKenna argue that sexual dimorphism is not given in nature, but imposed upon nature by the perceiver. "Gender is a social construction, a world of two sexes is the result of the socially shared, taken-for-granted methods which members use to construct a world" (vii). The perceiver's expectation that there are two genders leads to the perception of two gen- ders by forcing all perceived phenomena into the posited dichotomous categories. Anomalies are hidden and ambiguities masked, allowing the perceived phenomenon to conform to and thereby confirm the validity of the original expectation. According to Kessler and McKenna, the selective perception that sustains gender attribution in daily life also shapes the socially accredited perceptions of scientists, whose work is then taken as incontrovertible proof of the validity of the perceptual categories. Scientists construct dimorphism where there is continuity. Hor- mones, behavior, physical characteristics, developmental processes, chromosomes, and psychological qualities have all been fitted into dichotomous categories. Scientific knowledge does not inform the answer to the question, "What makes a person a man or a woman?" Rather it justifies (and appears to give grounds for) the already ex- isting conviction that a person is either a man or a woman and that there is no problem differentiating between the two. Biological, psy- chological, and social differences do not lead to our seeing two gen- ders. Our seeing two genders leads to the "discovery" of biological, psychological, and social differences. (163)</page><page sequence="29">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 677 Kessler and McKenna's goal is to discern how gender attributions are made, for once a person has been classified as a man or a woman, his or her actions and intentions are interpreted on the basis of culturally specific gender expectations that have pervasive life consequences. In accordance with the modernist assumption that biology provides the foundation for masculinity and femininity, most people believe that the genitals provide the ultimate criterion for gender attribution. But Kessler and McKenna point out that, in daily practice, attribution is almost always made in the absence of any information about genitals. Sex assignment at birth typi- cally follows from the delivering physician's inspection of genitalia, but in social interactions, the decision to categorize another as male or female seldom turns on such direct inspection. The recent emphasis on gender identity as the ground for the dichotomous cassification of men and women makes gender identity a possible basis for gender attribution. But, gender identity, as the psychological sense of being a man or a woman, is not immediately perceptible. Kessler and McKenna note that the only way to ascertain someone's gender identity is to ask the individual a direct ques- tion, and such queries are not typically made prior to gender attribution. How, then, is gender attributed? Kessler and McKenna argue that gen- der attribution depends upon cues given by the perceived that facilitate categorization on the basis of socially constructed, gender-specific norms. The dimensions of the presentation of self that provide cues for gender attribution include: modes and content of speech; styles of dress, adorn- ment, posture, and movement; and the construction of a narrative history that conforms to gender stereotypes (126-28). For gender attribution that depends excusively upon visual encounters, "tertiary sexual characteris- tics"- nonverbal behaviors such as facial expressions, movement, body posture - are the predominant gender markers. Kessler and McKenna in- troduce the term cultural genitals to characterize these culturally specific appearances that sustain inferences about gender. Gender attribution is de- pendent upon "genital attribution, but genital attribution "takes place ir- respective of biological genitals on the basis of 'cultural genitals'- that are assumed to be there" (153-54). People believe that sound inferences about biology can be made on the basis of stylized gender cues and this belief fixes gender symbolization in the body. "The relationship between cultural genitals and gender attribution is reflexive. The reality of'gender' is proved by the genital which is attributed and at the same time the attributed geni- tal only has meaning through the socially shared construction of gender attribution" (155). Kessler and McKenna insist that gender categories are culturally specific. In order to demonstrate that dichotomous classification is not the only</page><page sequence="30">678 I Hawkesworth alternative, they discuss the berdache--a person who receives social sanc- tion to become a gender other than that to which he or she was originally assigned--as a third gender recognized by certain Native American peoples. How, then, are culturally specific gender categories constructed? Since psychology treats gender as a "way of seeing," Kessler and McKenna review psychoanalytic, social learning, and cognitive development theories for clues to the construction of gender categories. They argue persuasively that none of these approaches can explain adequately either the individual's acquisition of gender categories or the social construction of gender cate- gories. They turn instead to the idea of a cognitive schema to explain the organizing expectations that shape perception. "A categorizing scheme is not dependent on any particular cue, nor is it a rule followed by robots. Rather it is a way of understanding ... a method of applying information" (158, cf. 161). In keeping with their ethnomethodological approach, they suggest that these categorizing schemas arise from the incorrigible proposi- tions of specific cultures, bracketing questions concerning the origins of the incorrigible propositions themselves. Unfortunately, such a bracketing removes from consideration some of the difficult questions about the na- ture of, and possibilities for change in, categorizing schema and severely limits Kessler and McKenna's prescription for escaping the life-constrain- ing force of dichotomous gender. Kessler and McKenna suggest that the key to transforming gender lies in changing our incorrigible propositions. They suggest that this can be done by "confronting the reality of other possibilities (e.g., the berdache), as well as the possibility of other realities" (164). Enhancing awareness of other cultures could then serve to liberate people from the natural attitude. In addition, they suggest marshaling logical arguments and empirical evi- dence to demonstrate the deficiencies in incorrigible beliefs as a means of dispelling them. Kessler and McKenna recognize, for example, that the complementarity thesis undergirds sociobiological accounts of gender. A clear understanding of gender attribution should therefore help dispel the erroneous belief that gender differentiation saves the species from extinc- tion by enabling sperm producers and egg producers to recognize each other. They demonstrate that gender attribution is based upon cultural genitals that can provide no certainty whatsoever about who might be a suitable reproductive partner. Thus gender fails in its "evolutionary mis- sion," a failure so significant that it should be sufficient to undermine socio- biological claims. Despite the lucidity of their argument, the reliance upon rational argument to expunge such errors confronts a problem. If incorri- gible beliefs are as impervious to evidence as their definition suggests, this strategy is doomed to failure. And if categorizing schema routinely screen</page><page sequence="31">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 679 out anomalies to the extent that Kessler and McKenna claim, then it is unlikely that culture-bound individuals will be able to perceive the evi- dence that other cultures afford. The very presuppositions of ethnometho- dology undermine the possibility of freeing people from gender by an ap- peal to evidence, for that evidence is theoretically constructed within a particular cultural frame, and, according to Kessler and McKenna, "Ulti- mately there is no way to determine the truth of theoretical formulations. Theories may be more or less useful, aesthetically pleasing, or 'in vogue,' but their claim to truth is, in some sense, a matter of faith in basic assump- tions" (100). And reason is no match against faith. What is important about Kessler and McKenna's conception of gender is not merely their insightful account of the mechanics of gender attribu- tion, but their subtle shift of gender's terrain. Gender moves from a styliza- tion of the body to a category of the mind. It is, in an important sense, an immaterial substance--an intangible idea with palpable consequences, an a priori category that structures the phenomenal world. The notion of cog- nitive schema that is invoked in this work is seriously undertheorized. It is not clear whether such a mental category has more in common with Hume's notion of a "habit of the mind," with Kant's conception of a "cate- gory of the mind," or with cognitive psychology's version of "prototype theory." Each of these acknowledges the active role of the knower in con- structing the object of knowledge, but they differ in their accounts of the origins of such categories, the role of tradition, reason, and language in structuring these categories, and in their assessments of how coherent, ubiquitous, and persistent such categorizations may be. Feminists who de- scribe gender as a lens (Bem 1993), a way of seeing, or a cognitive category may not mean to invoke the full force of the Humean or Kantian concep- tions, but they should proceed with extreme caution. Hume, for example, links "habits of the mind" to constant conjunction of empirically observ- able phenomena, suggesting that where the eye perceives two things oc- curring together, the mind imposes a "necessary connection." Extrapolat- ing the Humean model to gender produces an account that locks cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity to sexed bodies with a degree of necessity that it is nearly impossible to break. Similarly, Kantian catego- ries of the mind constitute the condition of rationality. If gender is con- strued as a category of the mind, then no thinking subject can escape its grip. For those who would eradicate gender-based injustice, there are dire implications in the displacement of gender from external world to internal, mental terrain. It is not at all clear that one can alter gender construed as cognitive schema. Moreover, the mind as a site of political action raises unsavory images of political intrusion and abuse. Within a social</page><page sequence="32">680 I Ilawkesworth constructionist frame, cognitive schema may serve merely to mark the so- cial constitution of consciousness. But if this is what is meant, then culture resurfaces in this discourse without any cear explication of why particular cultures cause dichotomous perceptions of gender. Biological determinism may be avoided in this account, but the natural attitude remains entrenched, as the cunning of culture structures the basic categories of the mind. The problematics of gender as explanans Gender as an analytic category illuminates a range of questions for feminist investigation and provides a framework for those investigations that chal- lenges androcentric assumptions. A sophisticated understanding of gender as a theoretical tool can enable feminists to identify important issues per- taining to social institutions and relations, as well as individual identity, that can be researched within particular cultures and subcultures at parti- cular historical moments. Developing conceptual distinctions that dif- ferentiate sex, sexuality, sexual identity, gender identity, gender role, and gender-role identity can enable feminist scholars to deploy gender as an analytic device, engaging questions that confound the natural attitude and thereby contribute to progressive feminist politics. If feminist scholars are to use gender as an analytic category that fosters emancipatory projects, however, there are crucial pitfalls to avoid. The foregoing analysis of a number of feminist efforts to theorize gender lo- cates one danger in the construction of a narrative that links gender to the cunning of culture operating in the interests of reproduction. These efforts to explain the function of gender replicate problematic assumptions of the ideology of procreation, rather than dispelling the natural attitude. Despite repeated references to cultural specificity, these accounts suggest a universal and invariant role for gender. Race, class, and ethnicity disappear from these accounts as the cunning of culture produces species survival, compul- sory heterosexuality, heightened sexual pleasure, or categories of the mind. I have tried to show that in each of these works the effort to theorize gender involves a subtle shift from an account of "how" gender operates under specific historical conditions to a universal claim about "why" gen- der performs a particular social function. In this shift, gender is trans- formed from an analytic category into a causal force. The heuristic tool is displaced as gender is accorded an ontological status. It is described as the cause of certain beliefs about the world; the force that molds a plastic hu- manity, produces naturalized bodies, or imposes sexual dimorphism; the determinant of identity; the process that structures labor, power, and ca- thexis; or the mental category that structures a form of dichotomous percep-</page><page sequence="33">S I G N S Spring 1997 I 681 tion. The distortion involved in the move from analytic category to causal force becomes apparent when the causal claims are subjected to critical scrutiny. Whether gender is advanced to explain the cultural production of heterosexual desire, the psychoanalytic production of individual identity, the power asymmetries in social life, or the structure of perception, close examination of these claims reveals that the imputed causality is un- founded. Although gender as analytic category can be invaluable to femi- nist scholarship in illuminating certain facets of social existence, it is a grave error to attribute explanatory force to gender. Feminist analysis is not strengthened when gender is conflated with universal explanans. On the contrary, ersatz explanation is dangerous. It proffers a false security, suggesting that issues in need of interrogation and analysis are already understood. Constructing a functionalist narrative of gender that appears to possess universal validity occludes cultural specific- ity and historical variability, according gender an intransigence that is markedly unhelpful to feminist projects. Rather than tracing the instability of gender as a cultural category, marking the fault lines, and searching for points at which feminist interventions might be possible, gender as univer- sal explanans aggregates various forms of difference, disadvantage, and do- mains of social life under one vague, reproductive rubric, masking the spec- ificity of problems and impairing the identification of possible solutions. There is no question that women experience systematic disadvantages in male-dominated societies, forms of injustice that constrain their opportu- nities and life prospects. But gender can explain these disadvantages only by definitional fiat. As a mode of explanation, functionalism has been faulted for insensitiv- ity to history, a teleology that conflates putative function with genetic cause, a tendency to mask power, and a conservative propensity to legiti- mate the status quo. None of these features of functionalism sits well with the liberatory impulse of feminist scholarship and feminist politics. Func- tionalist explanations of gender are particularly worrisome because they accord gender an intractability that renders transformative strategies either inconceivable, utopian, or impracticable. According gender a functional role in relation to reproduction also lends cultural constructions of gender unwarranted legitimacy. I have already noted that gender as universal ex- planans occludes the mediations of race, class, and ethnicity, and, in so doing, works against a feminist politics that tries to build solidarities across the divisions of race, class, and ethnicity. To the extent that gender as uni- versal explanans shifts feminist politics toward issues of self, psyche, and sexuality, it structures a politics that is insufficiently inclusive. As Chandra Mohanty has pointed out, feminist strategies that privilege privatized</page><page sequence="34">682 I Hawkesworth gender fail to engage Third World women who locate their politics in a collective struggle against racism, sexism, colonialism, imperialism, and monopoly capital (Mohanty, Russo, and Torres 1991, 2-38). The problematic accounts of gender discussed in this article suggest that gender as universal explanans poses grave threats to the potential benefits of gender as analytic category. If feminist scholars are to confound gender and the natural attitude, rather than be confounded by gender, it will be helpful to enrich our conceptual terminology, taking advantage of crucial distinctions such as sexed embodiedness, sexuality, sexual identity, gender identity, gendered divisions of labor, gendered social relations, and gender symbolism, rather than collapsing such diverse notions into the single term gender. Feminist scholars must also steadfastly resist the tendency to treat gender as universal explanans, to construe it as causal force in domains as disparate as psyche, self, and social relations. Universal claims about the invariability of gender and unwarranted assumptions about the cunning of culture securing gender's psychic and social functions are self-defeating, for they signify the persistence of the natural attitude in feminist discourses, a fundamental failure to escape its grip.
