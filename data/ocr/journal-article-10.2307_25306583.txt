<plain_text><page sequence="1">[From the North American Reviow.] PHtILOSOPHY OF THE FINE ARTS. BY ERNEST VON LASAULX, The progress of science and civilization consists In this, that every idea (isappears in a hi,,gher idea. A new tbought reveals itselt; and the world that seemed so txed becomes flui( again, and takes another shape as It spins around the axis of this new thought. The discovery of a simple hydrostatic principle rendere(d superfluous the stupendous masonry of Roman acque(lucts. They were built to weather the assaults of ages, but they were all toppled down by the breath of one thinlking mian. Thus one art overturns an other. Durilng the Middle Ages the ascendant art was architecture, includingo, as subordinate branches, sculpture, which chiseled the portals, nnd painting, which illuminated the win(lows. All the intellectual and mesthetic energry of the age converged to this onie point. The stuff that now makes the poet then made the arclhitect, the sculptor, or thle painter. The inspiration which now produces a book then produced a building. The thlinker, unwilling to intrust his thoughts to the fleeting breatlh of'a wand(lering minstrel, or to A perislhaible manuscript whicll few had either the ability or opportunity to read, wrote them on enduring tablets of stoue, and lilted them up be fore the eyes of all men.' In this literature of the quiarry, Abelard's tlee-thinking lound utterance, as well as Hlcidebrand's hierarchiy. Every change of public opinlon nund all social and political revo lutions are recorded here. Even the scepticirms and heresies that crept into the Church are sculp tuLre(d oni its walls anid over its portals, in chisel ings as caustic as the epigramis of Rabelais or the drops that flowed t-om, the pen of Erasmus. But when Guttenberg, invented movable types, and in company with John Falust establishe(d his litt!e printing- press at M- etz, in the year 1450, the life of architecture wlent out. It is easier to print a word than to hew a stone, to sbape a sentence than to erect a column, to publish a book than to put in motion tonis of material for the purpose ot' translatingr a thought into a building. Besides, the ubiquity of the printed page more than com pensates for the durability of the sculptured stone. TUhe paper leaves that fly abroad and till the earth are more imporislbable than piles of solid masopry. A seconcl irruption of barbaria&amp;ns mligrht blot out forever the fiamous stanze of Raplhael, and oblit crate the cycles.of Sibyls and prophets culminat lna in ' The Last Judgment, " ID which Michael Angelo has traced the origin, growlth, and final dispensation of theocracy; but the thouglht once impressed on the printed page is not subject to suclh contingencies; it Is IIexempt from the wrong of time and capable of perpetual renova tioll." Tlhus the craft of the printer, by f'urnislh lna the readiest mode of utterance, and, at the same timo, the best means of preserving the thing uttered, superseded the primative didactic Vocation of the artist; henceforth ais function was to adorn the doctrine which he had hitherto been required to teach. I IIowever beneficial tlho invention of printing, may have been to the advancement of science and the spread of civilization, it necessarily eXerted an influence unfavorable to art, annd especially to architecture. Architecture coming in coniflct with it miade a dlesperate struggl, for life. It went baclk to Rome and Greece, and engrafted classic on Christian art, producing the period known as the Renaissance, which atterwards de generated Into the Rococo and Periwig, ot the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But it was in vain. All the past could not save it. It is virtually dead, and we shall never builld cathe drals so long as we can print cyclopmdias. There has been-no great architecture since the six teenth. century. The last of the giant builders was Michael Angelo, who died in 1564, the year in which Shakspeare was born; aind even he ex pressed himself in thls form less freely than his predecessors. With the same cubic feet of mate rial, Brunellesehi ol the iifteenth century is -grand er than Michael Angelo of the sixteenth. Com pare the dome of Santa Maria dei Fiori in Florence with that of St. Peter's in Rome, and the former displays a deeper intelligence and a finer flow of originality. In the latter, the sublime is to a great degree lost in the merely stupendous. The only great attempt at Gothic architecture in the present century-the New Palace of Westminster -is a most signal iailure. In comparison with the old Abbeyv that stands near it, it is an empty and tilvolous gewgaw; and yet the Abbey itself is tkr in'erior to the great cathedrals of the Conti nent. The protusion of ornament which Sir Charles Barry lavished on the edifice could not hide its real decrepitude. It does not enklindle tlho faintest spark of creative interest. It is the cold mechanical imitation of what ceased.to be an inspiration more than three centuries ago, thl hollow muask moulded on the face of a dead civili zation. It is " a monument of Gothic art " in a far diflerent sense !rom that in which the guide books employ those words. Next in the ascending series of the flne arts stands sculpture. Originally, as we have seen, it was closely allied to architecture, and for a long time subordlinate to it. The statues of India and Egypt are all essentially architectural; withl half closed, heavy eyes, and arms pinioned to their sides, they lack lie and liberty. Greek statuary, on the other hand, is endowed with a freedom and individuality corresponding to the emancipation of the religious consciousness of the Greek people. This freedom, however, was only a gradual at tainment on the part of the Greeks. "Life is short, and art is long," and the perfection of all human productions is not to be reached by the efforts of a few generations, much less within the hour-glass of one man's life, but depends on the accumulated labor and experience of successive ages, each mounting higher than the former by a slow, spiral ascent, which often seems like mov ing on a dead level. Thus the earliest Greelk sculpture is only a slight advance beyond the Indian and the Egyptian, and appears to have beeu derived from them. It is a difierentistage of the same type, another expression of a relig,ious symbolism, in which every attitude, limb, and feature has some moral or intellectual signif cance. Consequently we find in the sremotest periods of Hellen.c art images which we might expect to see only on the banks of the Nile or the Gangces. Three-eyed Jupiters, four-armed Apollos, a Bacehus in thle form of a bull, a Eury nome like a mermaidl, a colossal Dianna with ten hieroglyphic tiers of breasts, and-a black Ceres with the head of a horse encircled with serpents. The period whlich produced these monst,rosities was pantheistic; they are the enmbodimlents of the old Orphic theology, in Which the; ods were res gardedl as substantial potencies ori powers of nature, prescriptive types oA i(leas andl qualities to which we (lo not always possess the key, Apollo was originally the sun-god, extending bis arms on all st(des like rays Of light. But as light is the emblemn of knowledge, he became the god(1 of prophecy and the corypheus of the Muses, and finally was endowed with a distinct personality ad the god-man, the ideal of spiritual power and beauty. So it was with the ol(dest images of' all the deities, which were supposed,to have fallen from heaven. They were highly symbolical in their purpose, and very stiff and conventional in their mode of representation. In some of the most primitive temples they were -mere blocks of wood or slone, with limbs and lineatnents ruddly in(licated bv lines drawn on or deeply cut into the surface, alter the manner of Egyptian basso relhevos. In others the divinities are not dis tinguishable from each other in form or feature, but only by their emblems,-the thunderbolt, the trident, the caduceus, or the palm branch. They were not intende(d to resemnble persons, but to represent principles. The lively imagination and symmetrical mind of the Greek soon revolted against these bungling and materialistic methodS of expressing attributes. The hundlred hands of Briareus and the multitudinous eyes ot' Argus are cheap anid childish contrivances to indicate power and intelligence, compared with the ambrosial curls and knitted brow of the Olympian Jove or the prophetic glance and majestic front ot Apollo. Yet so slow was the growth of art even in Greece, that after Dedalus had half freed the statue fomni its original clay by openiing its eyes and separat ingr its legs, eight centuries elapsed before it be came a living soul under the handl of Phidias. Sculpture, as well as architecture, was at first employed exciusively in the service of religion, and even during Its palm;est days, in the age 6f Pericles, it continiued to be devoted to this end in all its highest eflorts. In Athens there was doubtless miluch stone cutting and wall paintiui applie(d to the daily necessities of life, but statues and pictures, as objects of art, were, as we hale said, unknowvn in private (dwellings. Before the time of Socrates there is inot a stngle instance of' a portrait bust; and portrait painting was first praictised in the school of Apelles, a contempo rary of Alexander the Great. Pausanias (I. 16) in!orms us that a certain Phryne contrived to gain possession o1 a statuette ot Cupid made by her lover Praxiteles; but she daredl not incur the danger of keeping it, and consequently atoned tor her impiety by consecrating it as a public woi'k of art at Thespia, her native city. In Athens there were no private galleries of art, such as we tfnd in modern European cities. Phidias was forbid den even to put his nanie on the statue of Mi nerva; andl because it was alleged that in thbe representation of the battle ot the Greeks and Amazons, which adorned the shiel(d of the god dess, he had introduced among, other figures the portraits of himself and Pericles, he was accused of impious ambition and tbrown into prison, where he died. It was not until the Macedlonian age that the plastic arts began to forg,et their sacred destination, and degenerate into means of gratifying the luxury of indhriduals. -The I une tion oi the sculp)tor was half priestly; he was the commissioned interpreter of thle go.ds. We are</page><page sequence="2">AMLeRICAN ART JOURNAL. 61 told that, when Phidias had completed the Olyim pian Jove, the lightring fell from heaven and touched the statue in approbation of the work. It is this cause of sacredness that confers a value on these forms. In the procrress ot sculpture, from the shape ot an Ephesian Dianna to the beautiful proportions of ani Apollo Belvedere, we can trace the progress of theological ideas from pantheism to anthropomorphism. The same is true of Christian sculptuie and painting, I the Middle Ages, as in Asia, in Egypt, and in Greece, art began with relig,ious themes. Architecture, as we have seen, led the way, and became the parent of the whole family ot arts. It is difficult for us to form a conception of the sacredness which surrounded the vocatibn ot the medimaval artist. He had a higher aim than technical beautv, the glories of color, or feats of anatomical s:;ill. It was a holy offlce comulitted to consecrated hands. The academnies of art in those days were religious fraternities and soc'ieties for spiritual editication. Such were the schools oI Siena and Florence during the fourteenth cen tury. The code which prescribed the qualifica tions for memifbership laid more stiress on personal piety than on technical skill. A Spanish sculptor who broke iin pieces a statue ot Christ because the purchaser refused to pay the stipulated price, was convicted of sacrilege by the Inquision. As an artist he was ordained to a holy task. The marble became in his hands what the wafer is in the hands of the priest, a sacred thing; and as it was moulded into formn, it received a consecra tion which took it flom the possession of the indi vidual and placed it under the protection of the Church. To this habit of thinking, more than to any influence of climate and social customs, the Greeks owedl their supremacy in sculpture, and the nmediaeval Italians their superiority in paint ing. On this la(lder art ascended to the heaven of its divineness. Its objects were not deilfed by their beauty, so much as beautified by their divin ity. The artist was at the same time a wvorsliip per, to whom the expression of beauty was a service of piety, and from th3 depths of whose fervent religious emotion sprang, forth a throng of shapes flishing, with all the lustre that devotion couid lavish upon them. The rude, unfashioned stone, before which the Arcadian bowed in reve rence, was like a mag,net that set in motion all the invisible currents of his religlous nature. It was this tine susceptibility to mental impressions derived from material images, aidedl by an ex quisite perception of the significance and testhetic value of form, that enabled Grecian art to break the tough chrysalis of a conventional type, and emerge lfee and gloriously transmuted. In sculpture still more than in architecture the thought predominates over the material, and is more clearly expressed in it. It is therefore a higher art than architecture. The material is the same; but it takes a bodily form, and thus ad vances tromi the inorganic to the orgeranic. It is not merely erectingr a temple, but it is buildinog a human body, the temple of the soul. The per fection of sculpture rests on the correspondency of soul and body, on the idea of the supremacy 6f psychological over the physiolog,ical, that every soui builds its own body and huds in it an ade-, quate expression of itself; as Spencer says, "For of the soul the body form doth take, For soul is form, and doth the body make." In painting, the spiritual predominates still m~ore over the material; in faCt, one. of the pri mary qualities of matter is eliminated, viz.: thick ness. A painting has only two dimensions, length and breadth. Sculpture uses the same substance as architecture, but it controls and permeate3 it more completely; there is no super fluous residue, nothing- that is not filled with lite. In the glow of the.artist's inspiration, the marble becomes as wax in his hands, and is easily moulded to the image of his thought. Painting, in its purer ideality, works in a finer substance. It represents the life of the soul, not in the heavy masses of sculpture, but in the play of light and shadow on a colored surface. The simple lhct that painting can represent that "world of elo quent light," the human eye, gives it a v3st supe riority over the somnambulic forms of sculpture; although it must be confessed that this limitation of sculpture is niot without peculiar advantages, for the light which is withdrawn from the eye is diffused through all the members, spiritualizing them, so that the statue seems only to have been "1 laid asleep In body, and become a living soul." Sculpture is best employed in isolated figures, and seldom ventures beyond the representation of smuall groups in which the characters are inti mately related; such as man and woman both toggether constituting, one complete human being; the youtlh, the maiden, and the mother; Laoco6n and his sons in the folds of the serpent; Slee,) and Death, as seen at San Ildefonso in Spain; or the celebrated trinity of Scopas and Praxiteles, personifying the kindred affections, Eros, Hime ros, and Pothos. It is only in basso-relievo that it can express the coplex interests of historic or dramatic sentiment consistently with grace and dignity: and anl the larger groups of free sculp ture which antiquity has bequeathed to us, such as the Fiobe, the Elgin and the Boinean marbles, were purely architective, i. e. they were employed as reliefs to adorn the metopes and pediments of temples, and were therefore in their nature and use pictorial. Painting, on the contrary, does not stop with the single portrait or the group, but, by means of foreshortening and perspect ive, blends the far and the near into great compo sitioz1s, epic, historical, and allegorical. The oldest sculpture is architectural, and the oldest painting is sculpturesque. Each grew up in ap prenticeship to its predecessor before it appeared as a master art. Sculpture, in the different phases of relievo, was lrst employed as a decora tion in connection with temples, and color was originally applied to enliven and heihbten the expression of statuary. Thus they are all united in a vital continuity of development; emanations of the same pious enthusiasm, and devoted to the same spiritual service. [To be continued.]</page></plain_text>
