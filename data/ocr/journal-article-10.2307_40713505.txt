Douglas This book, a small, brown volume issued by the University of Alabama Press in 2000, languished for years at the bottom of the stack of books in the book review editor's office, and then for months more on this reviewer's desk. This lack of attention should perhaps comes as no surprise, as archaeologists, historians, and cultural resource managers have, with a few notable exceptions, devoted little serious research to the (unfortunately named) field of rock art, especially in the eastern United States. This is regrettable, as the study of anthropogenic markings on rock, whether in open air, rocksheiter, or deep cave sites, offers an important window into the ideology, iconography, and technology of prehistoric (and historic) societies in the Southeast, ranging from (at least) the late Archaic period well into the twentieth century. It is especially lamentable in this case, as this book by Carol Diaz- Granados and James R. Duncan, which grew out of Diaz-Granados dissertation, offers a solid model for the recordation, analysis, and interpretation of an impor- tant category of artifact. Focusing on the prehistoric rock art of Missouri, this survey is comprehensive, and it sets a high standard for both the identification of styles and for the interpretation of specific motifs and combination of motifs (called panels). It also points the way for establishing temporal parameters for parietal art through direct radiocarbon dating, an innovation in the study of eastern sites which has subsequently been expanded upon in more recent works by the authors as well as other researchers in the region. The authors begin their study by clearly laying out the terrain of the field. After' first introducing the terminology they employ, they note previous investi- gations of rock art in the region and their relevance to the current research. Then they discuss the natural environment of Missouri, including its geology, fauna, and flora, especially emphasizing the patchwork pattern of open glades intermixed with forests. A 123</page><page sequence="2">SOUTHEASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 28(1) SUMMER 2009 lengthy section follows where Diaz-Granados and Duncan delineate their methodology for site inventory and investigation, beginning with locating reports of rock art in the Missouri state archeological records and from knowledgeable private individuals. Once a potential site was discovered, fieldwork included locating the reported site and documenting its content, media, and spatial relationships utilizing photographs, drawings, and copious notes. The context of the site was always carefully noted, including macro and micro-environments, orientation, elevation, and the presence of any surface (as opposed to parietal) artifacts or material. A search for satellite sites was also conducted, which often proved successful. After recordation was complete, which sometimes took several research trips, the state site files were updated and the authors processed the photographs, drawings, and any related artifacts in the lab. By moving beyond description and emphasizing the physical context of rock art, the authors ground their analysis in place, which itself was an important consideration for the creators of prehistoric markings. By dividing the physical environment into four categories, of caves and shelters, glades with outcrops, river and creek sites, and spring sites, patterning emerges. On a smaller scale, the specific location chosen by the artists and the spatial relationships within the sites show connections between motifs and environment (such as concentric circles and water), and it demonstrates that what we today might consider an "ideal" location was not necessarily true for the artist at the time. This contextual approach provides an important corrective for a field that previously tended to be both physically and theoretically disconnected from the landscape. One important contribution this book makes is its nuanced analysis of style in Missouri rock art. Because of cultural discontinuity in the study area, the direct historical approach, linking prehistoric art to descen- dant groups, was unavailable, so the authors turn to visual, comparative, and theoretical approaches. For them, style involves media, form, content, technique, and the manner of depiction. While a lack of chronological data makes the identification of individ- ual artists difficult, by analyzing motifs and panels in these stylistic categories, Diaz-Granados and Duncan are able to identify two primary styles, one in northeast Missouri and the other in the southeast quadrant of the state. In addition to these, which apply to both pictographs and petroglyphs, the authors note six limited styles, existing at unique complex sites which are unconnected to other known sites, and several quasi-styles, defined as sites which repeat motifs or panels but are not large or complex enough to bear cross site comparison. The latter includes small single motif sites. A detailed discussion of the characteristic of these styles follows, including analysis of 58 motifs or elements, which include birds, snakes, quadrupeds, anthropomorphic beings, and various geometric de- signs such as rayed circles. Some of these-such as bilobed arrows, maces, and warriors in regalia-are linked to the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. Numerous distribution maps accompany this discus- sion, adding a larger level of spatial analysis across differing styles. The interpretation of rock art has been a perilous venture, and recent scholars have generally been circumspect on the topic, fearing to overreach. Care is certainly called for, especially in light of some unfortunate early pronouncements which did not hold up well under scrutiny. In their work, Diaz-Granados and Duncan offer cautious strategies for approaching the interpretation of rock art, properly starting with a reminder that specific motifs meant different things to different people at different times. They primarily turn to cognitive, comparative, and ethnological approach- es, arguing that symbolic artifacts shed light on past belief systems. They utilize the iconography and oral traditions of other Native American groups, especially those with linguistic links to the (presumed) artists. Employing these strategies, the authors tentatively interpret various sites as portraying creation myths, ceremonies (like the green corn ceremony), and even specific figures such as Red Horn. Based on their analysis, they conclude that much of the function of rock art was ritualistic, and that spatial patterning, such as placement on vertical bluffs and on dolomite boulders, was fairly consistent. Finally they suggest that any culture history of Missouri must take rock art into account. This last insight should be rigorously applied throughout the wider region in both research design and CRM activities. This book, although no longer the latest word in the field, remains an important contribution, and it deserves a wide readership among archaeologists and resource managers. The authors correctly note the importance of rock art in the prehistoric landscape. They point the way for future research, such as their call for closer study of the pigments utilized in pictographs. As this and other recent studies have suggested, if there is exposed rock, there is a good chance someone marked on it in the past. Identifying and studying these markings is important in under- standing how past cultures perceived and interacted with the physical environment, and how they located elements of culture (like myth) in that environment. Protecting these sites is also critical, as many are threatened by erosion and vandalism, and the resourc- es need to be preserved both for research and for responsible public interpretation.

This book by Diaz- Granados and Duncan is certainly a significant factor (and milestone) in that development.</page></plain_text>
