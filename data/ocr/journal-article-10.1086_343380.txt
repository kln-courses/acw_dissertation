      <p>D. Graham Burnett's account of Guyana's <italic>invention</italic>—explorer‐cartographer Robert Schomburgk's self‐aware construction and visualization of a territory answering the expectations of the Royal Geographical Society (and later the British Crown) seems fully to justify this Vichian conceit—has an onion‐like history. Or so one suspects. At the core is an émigré Prussian, intellectually impressed by the natural philosopher of his homeland, Alexander von Humboldt, and emotionally attracted to the imperial idol of his adopted land, Sir Walter Raleigh. Schomburgk, Burnett argues, not only gives cartographic plausibility to Guyana, not least through a series of picturesquely inscribed landmarks, but also fixes the site of El Dorado. Here, if not before, new layers of significance grow round Schomburgk's enterprise. In a masterly, and generous, survey of recent scholarship foregrounding the diversely motivated constructedness of geographical reality, Burnett seeks to persuade us that Schomburgk's expedition reports, his description of “British Guiana,” and his twelve views of the interior (all printed between 1839 and 1841) present certain novel features within this skeptically theorized arena.</p>
      <p>The first of these is El Dorado itself. On the assumption that Raleigh propagated an entire fiction, Burnett can raise the “most interesting idea: a terra incognita that, though by definition unknown, is nevertheless recognised to be a historical source” (p. 37). And he proceeds to introduce the rhetorical term “metalepsis” to indicate how, in authenticating Raleigh's claims, Schomburgk as it were overleaped them and once again demonstrated their mythical nature. Here Burnett also overleaps chronology, as Schomburgk produced his edition of Raleigh a decade after leaving the field. (Whereupon Schomburgk risked pulling the carpet from under his own feet when he speculated that, after all, Raleigh probably never believed in El Dorado!) When, in 1837, Schomburgk claimed to have located El Dorado in the headwaters of the Essequibo, “he grounded his claim to have reached the true site in the extensive work of his role model and compatriot Alexander von Humboldt” (p. 29). What Humboldt had located in a library in Paris, Schomburgk relocated in a swampy anastomosing water system associated with a village by the name of Parima.</p>
      <p>This chapter in imperial mythopoeia is thoroughly exposed, and not without a fine sense of irony. One might quibble (in defence of El Dorado) that Raleigh's golden vision was a structural topos of early European imperalism, that the true Guyana was to be found somewhere between the battered naval coffers of Madrid and London and the desire this bred to discover a get‐rich‐quick scheme. One might also want to reinsert the Amerindians in this and later projections onto the South American interior. After Columbus, another Cathay might be found there. Later the renegade maroon societies, which Burnett briefly mentions, created a third possibility, a proliferation of revolutionary emancipist republics. In short, the interior was diversely populated; the gears of progress and white paranoia did not exactly grind on nothing. In compensation, Burnett makes a suggestive foray into the spirit landscape. As the traverse surveyor depended on Amerindian guides, his route depended and was superimposed on a sacred geography. An invisible conquest underwrote the visible marks on the map, and Burnett suggests that an awareness of this lent an anthropomorphic and even Aristotelian inflection to landscape descriptions. Icarian anxieties around the Kaieteur Falls suggest that the explorer, too, was under a hypnotic spell—unless Schomburgk's dizzy recoil merely foreshadowed an epileptic fit (see p. 194).</p>
      <p>Burnett's reconstruction of the issues involved in establishing the existence of Guyana cartographically endows Schomburgk's practice with an exemplary value in displaying the technical, graphic, and epistemological challenges every surveyor confronted. Whether Schomburgk's work sustains this rapid promotion, I am not sure: although Burnett and his publishers generously illustrate the book with rival maps of Guyana by Schomburgk's contemporaries, they reproduce fewer of his own. At least one of them, with its picturesque insets, almost recalls a Renaissance chart, and its form suggests preparation for a popular audience. In fact, after the almost Proustian detail of his intuition of Schomburgk's mental life as a mapmaker, Burnett's interpretation of the <italic>Twelve Views</italic> is less well individualized. His suggestion that they exhibit overall a trajectory from the picturesque to the sublime and back again, and that this structure is repeated <italic>in parvo</italic> in the narrative at each site, seems laborious—although it might reflect a convergence of pictorial and narrative conventions due to the production and editing processes involved in bringing sketchbooks and notes into a publishable form. His impressive application of the concept of ground marking as a kind of graphic blotting (which he discerns in Schomburgk's use of open, dotted lines) applies more obviously to the <italic>Views.</italic> That is, their power is not only iconographic but also eidetic; they operate as designs on the land and not simply as allegories of ownership. It seems that none of Schomburgk's own field sketches survive.</p>
      <p>The yield of passing Schomburgk's visual, graphic, and literary legacy through the sieve of current theoretical debates in historical geography is considerable. The necessity of the process is rooted in the history of Schomburgk's own enterprise. The story of the transformation of the surveyor's tentative lines and speculative marks into a territorial boundary and strategy of colonial domination is familiar. The destiny of Schomburgk's routes and maps in this regard was especially dramatic—the northwest boundary with Venezuela, the southwest boundary with Brazil, and the eastern boundary with Dutch Guiana each subsequently led to intergovernmental disputes and arbitration. In other words, the textual production of empire was the precondition of its political existence. Burnett's demonstration of the intertextual character of the colonial surveyor's work does the same for the discipline of historical geography. In Burnett's imaginative and discreet dialogue between our ideas and theirs the political and ethical necessity of the dialectic is shown.</p>
      <p>Beyond the many felicities of style, deftly mingling his own Icarian flights of fancy with an indefatigable interest in the minutiae of day‐to‐day exploration, the singular merit of this volume is its production of the explorer as the genius loci of a textual territory. More the biography of a contested space than the history of a figure, Burnett's book manages to let Schomburgk's ideas about what he was doing weave in and out of the imperial agendas of his day in a way that illuminates strengths and weaknesses across the contemporary interdisciplinary landscape. The politics of geographical representation, for example, have singularly failed to engender a critical consciousness among prevailing politics driven by the <italic>el dorado</italic> of national sovereignty.</p>
      <p>Burnett's most handsomely produced study will be a model for any scholar exploring the nexus between biography, cartography, and imperialism. Ironically, Schonburgk's final survey in 1843 of the Corentyne ended in a homecoming via a tributary rather than the main stream. Confusion about the true headwaters, and the real area of the catchment, continues to the present day: “The ‘New River Triangle’ remains a no‐ man's‐land” (p. 253). As for the explorer as hero, “The phantom figure presided over what has remained a phantom history” (p. 253). Burnett's success is to show that such ironies matter because they are historically fateful. As he argues in his final pages, people may live <italic>by</italic> maps, but they do not live <italic>in</italic> them.</p>
