<plain_text><page sequence="1">Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute VOL. XXXI] 1950 [Parts MV VRTRAHÀ INDRA By R. N. Dandekar Vedic mythology, as we generally know it from the jļ Igveda ( ĶF ), is clearly dominated by the personality of Indra. By far the largest number of sūktas - about 250 out of 1028 - are exclusively devoted to the glorification of this god. Apart from these sūktas , there are several others, wlierein Indra is praised in association with other gods or is referred to in some other connection. Indra is thus obviously the most popular god of the Vedic. pantheon; Even in later times he has been regarded almost as the very symbol of the official Vedic religion - the Indra-mythology being very nearly identified with the- Vedic religion as a whole. It is true that Indra is celebrated in nearly one fourth of the ĶF, but this fact must not be taken to indicate, as is usually done, that the Vedic religion had all along been dominated by the Indra-mythology. Such an assumption, which is the result of studying the Vedic mythology as if it were a static phenomenon, would make it difficult rationally to correlate several mythical concepts in the Veda with the facts derived from the study of çpmparative philology, comparative mythology, anthropology, and the cultural history of the Aryans. A critical study of the Veda would show that the Vedic mythology is essentially an ' evolutionary ■ mythology ; that, at different stages in the evolution of the Vedic mythological thought, it has been dominated by different Vedic</page><page sequence="2">a Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute gods ; and that the Indra-dominated mythology represents but à late stage in the course of that evolution. There is another aspect of this 4 evolutionary * character of the Vedic mytho- logy. It will be seen that the personality of a Vedic god normally presents a very complex picture. It often contains elements which are mutually inconsistent or sometimes even self-contradic- tory. This peculiar mythological phenomenon can be satisfactorily explained only, on the assumption that a Vedic god possesses a ' growing ' personality. With the different vicissitudes in Vedic life and culture, different elements came to be introduced into the personality of a Vedic god. In other words the dynamic character of the life of the Vedic people is faithfully reflected in the complex mate-up of their gods. To emphasize only certain specific elements in a god's personality and thus try to define his character, one way or another, would, therefore, be .unsound. What we have to do is to determine, in the light of the facts derived from the study of comparative philology, Comparative mythology, anthropology and th'e-cultural history of the Aryans, the priority of these varied elements, and thereby present, so to say, a complete history of the entire i becoming ' of a Vedic god. A study of the Vedic god, Indra, from the point of view of this two-fold evolutionary chara- cter of the Vedic mythology, would illumine several obscure points concerning the Vedic mythology in general and the personality of Indra in particular. If we were to analyse the large number of the i?F-passages referring to Indra and his activities, we would find that they present three main strands of the personality and character of that god. Indra is presented as a cosmic power; as a warlike leader of the Vedic Aryans ; and as an ancient mythical dragon-killing hero. Möst of the descriptions of Indra are centred round his war with and subsequent victory over Vrtra. This is by far the most out- standing event in Indra's career. A proper understanding of this event would, therefore, serve as an adequate starting point for a critical study of Indra's personality and character. We may begin with an ancient traditional attempt at interpreting this contest bet- ween Indra and Vrtra. Yàska, the author of the Nirukta , has posed the question : ko vrtrah : who was Vrtra?1 He has mentioned I Nirukta II. 16.</page><page sequence="3">VJ trahä Indra % two principal views regarding -this question. It appears that, mofe Or less by wáy of a pūrvapahfa, he refers to the opinion ofth'e Aitihāsikas, who believed that Vj-tra was a demon, a šim of Tvasfä. Without, however, caring to discuss and refute this view, Yàska states the view of the school of the Nairuktas, who held that Vftrk represented a cloud.1 This passage from the Ntrukta would thus clearly show that, even since very early times, there have been twò principal schools of interpretation of the Vedic mythology^ thie historical school, and the naturalistic school. The etyíhologists» among whom Yâska was the foremost, adhered to the naturalistic interpretation. The influence of the naturalistic school on Vedic studies in general has indeed been very great, and many scholars belonging to the earlier generation of modern Vedists accepted, without demur and almost as the final solution of the problem, thè theory that the Vedic gods represented various powers of nàturè and that the Vedic mythology consisted Of symbolical descriptions of various phenomena of nature. Incidentally, it may be pointed out that, among themselves, the naturalistic mythologists are hot unanimous as to which specific power of nature a particular Vedic god represented. In pursuance of the naturalistic ideology, the Vedic gods are classified into three categories : those belonging to the sky, those belonging to the mid-region, and those belonging to the earth, in accordance with the cosmic regions where the powers of nature represented by those gods normally become évident. The most dominant view, so far as the naturalistic interpretation of the Indra-mythology is concerned, is the one suggested by Yãskà. His lead has been followed by a majority of the early Vedists of thè modern times. Indra is said to be the personification of thunder- storm. He stands at the head of the gods of the antarihsa and is verily the rain-god of the Vedic pantheon. The heavenly WàtéfS are obstructed by the cloud-demon, Vftra. Indra, therefore, smites down this cloud-demon by means of his vajra or thunderbolt, and releases the waters, which then flow- down in the form of rakn showers/ The various descriptions, in the jřF, of the Indra-Vftrá¿ battle are said to be clearly indicative of the phenomena of thutt- * A« a matter of faot Yâska mentions the view of the Aitihliikaa after he has mentioned hie own.

Heaven and earth tremble with fea&lt; when, Indra strikes Vrtra with his bolt (I. 80.1 1 ; II. 11.9, 10 ; Vi. 1.7. 9 ). Trees are violently shaken and they bend as if in fear (I. 55.4 ; V. 32. to). As a matter of fact, everything trembles when this terrific war between Indra and Vrtra takes place (VI. 31.2 ). The thundering god ( X. 92.8 ) raises the dust on high ( VI. 18.2 ). The demon, who obstructs the free flow of waters is variously referred to as Vrtra, Ahi, Śambara, etc.1 He lay hidden among the waters ( II. 1 1 . 5 ), and Indra is said to have killed him while he was lying across the waters (II. 11. 7). Sometimes Indra is said to have torn asunder the mountains and released the waters or cows imprisoned in its caves ( I. 32.11 ; 57.6 ; III. 26.6 ; IV.17.1 ; X. 89.7 ). This theme is repeated in one form or another in most of the hymns which celebrate Indra's glory ( 1. 32 ; 80 ; II. 12 ; 14 ). A Vedic poet, while proclaiming the heroic deeds of Indra, begins by pointing out that the first of such deeds was that the wielder of the vajra slew the dragon lying on the mountain, released the waters, and pierced the belly of the mountains (1.32.1,2). In support of their theory that Indra is the Vedic rain-god, scholars have emphasized the fact of his close association with the Maruts. The Maruts, according to them, are clearly the storm-divinities, who help Indra in his great exploit ( III. 33.9 547.3-4 ; VI. 17. ti ; VIII. 63.2-3 ; X. 1 1 3.3 ). Indra's connection with the Maruts is so close that the epithet, marutvän , is more or less exclusively applied to Indra. 1 It is in their company - and often with their help - that Indra accomplishes all his celestial exploits, particularly ' According to Muir ( OST V, 95 ), the demons of drought - the hostile powers in the atmosphere who malevolently shut up the watery treasures in elouds - are oalled by a variety of names suoh as Vptra, Ahi, Susņa. D ARME- STETER ( Ormazd et Ahriman , p. 97) calls Vptra 'l'enveloppant* while Ludwig ( III, 337 ) says that Vptra keeps away the heavenly waters from the world. PERRY ( JAOS 11, pp. 117-205 ) is of the opinion that the different names for Vptra are but different names for one and the same thing, namely» the oloud. Acoording to MAGOUN ( The Early Religion , 106 ), the Ahi represent» originally nothing more than the crest of the approaohing thunderstorm looked upon as a gigantio snake. • Hillebrandt.

Vedists like Roth ( PW ), Oldenberg ( Rei. d. Feda, 29, 51, 1-34 ff. ), 1 Macdonell (FM, 54 ff. ), Perry ( JAÓS 1 1, 117-203), and Bloomfield ( JAÓS 15, 143 ), have asserted that the picture of the thunderstorm is throughput quite clear in all these and numerous other descriptions of this kind ( I. 32.13 , 52. 6 ; 80.12 ; II. 30.3; V; 32.4 ). They, therefore, hold that Indra was essentially a rain-god in the .Veda. a In this connection, it is assumed that philologically the roots in : the words, indra and indu, are related to each other,' and that,' as 'suggested by Max Muller' íridrá 1 Oldenberg believes that Indra is a storm-god, who bears certain pre-Indian features. s ROTH ( Zeller*s Theologisches Jahrbuch 1846, 352 ) was originally of the opinion that Indra was the god of the bright olear vault of heaven. He derived the name Indra from the root, idh-indh , and took it to mean the 4 radiant one' ( ZDMO 1847, 72 ff. ). LASSEN {Ind. Alter, 1,893 ) adopted this view of ROTH, though the etymology of the word suggested by him was different from Roth's. As a matter of fact, Indra's close connection with the sky was assumed by several other scholars like Benfey ( 00, 48 ff. ), Max MüLLER ( Letters on Science of Language II, 470 ), GRASSMANN ( Wb ĘV ), and MYRIANTHEUS ( Die Ahvins, xvi ). Benfey regarded him as the god of the rain-sky, while MAX MÜLLER held that the real representative of Jupiter, in the Veda, was not Dyaus but Indra. According to that scholar and MülR { OS TV, 77) Indra was to be identified with Jupiter Pluvius. Later on, however, Max MÜLLER calls Indra the chief solar deity of India ( Chips II; 91 ). It hss been pointed out by Perry ( op. cit. ) that Indra cannot be regarded as a deity of the sky. He is essentially the deity of the mid-region. According to YSska, SGrya is the god in the sky. Indra ( or VSyu ) in the antarikąa , and Agni upon the earth. PERRY further suggests that, among all Indo-European mythologies, this division of the universe into three regions is peouliar to the Vedic mythology. The original functions of Dyaus, as conqueror of cloud demons, were, according to him, transferred by the Indian to another god, namely Indra, who was a specifically Indian divinity. This gave rise to Indra's supposed identification with the sky. The theory about Indra being a sky-god has, however, not found muoh favour with the later Vedists, even though they acoepted the naturalistic interpretation of the Vedio mythology. There are indeed only two most popular variations of the naturalistic interpretation of the Indra-mythology - namely, to vievr Indra either as a rain-god or as a sun-god. Only these two, therefore, h ?, v e been discussed at some length in this paper. * Chips # New Ed. IV, 396. Also Macdonell, VMt 66,</page><page sequence="6">4 Annals of ibt Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute -may have thus been associated with drops of rain-water.1 It has been •further suggested by some of the scholars mentioned above that •there was a two-fold development' of this basic character of ditdra. Otr the one hand, from a mere god of thunderstorm, he was elevated to the position of an all-god - of the creator and director of the entire universe ( I. 52.14; II. 30. r ; IV. 30.22 :; VIII. 85.6 ; X. 54.5 ) ; and on the other, the Vedic poets brought about the humanization of Indra's divine and cosmic person and described him as a human hero and war-lord ( I. 10.3 ; 1 30.8 ; IV; 26.3 ; VI. 18*3 ; VIII. 1:4.5, 24, 27 ; X. 49.2 ). , Let us critically examine the theory tliat Indra is the rain4gód in the Veda. It must be mentioned, at the very outset, that there undoubtedly are, in the personality of Indra as represented in the ĶV, a large number of elements of the character of a rain-god. But we may ask : can these elements be said to be the basic ■elements in Indra's character ? And, secondly, can these elements alone be said to indicate the entire personality and character of that god ? A minute and careful consideration of the descriptions in the RF of the Indra-Vrtra-contest brings out some significant facts in this connection. It will be seen that, in all such descrip- tions, the words like ' thunder ', ' cloud ', ' lightning ', ' raia etc., seldom occur directly. The waters, which Indra is credited with having released and let flow, are often terrestrial,, rather than celestial, waters. The terms, which are frequently used in these passages, are ' thunderbolt ' mountain ' fortresses ' cOws ' light ', ' waters etc. One would, therefore, be justified in asking whëther the main intention of the Vedic poets cOuld háve really been to suggest the phenomena of thunderstorm and rain through the symbolism of the Indra- Vrtra-war8. The occurrence, in the 1 Some scholars suggest that indu may rather indicate the drops of ♦Soma of which Indra is so fond. Benfey seems to connect the word, indra , with the root, sijand. Roth, giving up his original suggestion, derived it frota the root in-inv ( *= to press, to urge ) with suffix ra for nomina agentis and the addition of euphonic d. Indra thus means one who urges on or presses forward ( the rain-water ? ). ' Even Oldenberg holds ( R. d. V.f 140) that the 1 mountains ' mentioned in the Indra-Vrtra-conflict are not to be understood symbolically as clouds, but that, for the Vedic poet, they were real mountains. So too the rivers were not celestial waters but actual rivers on the earth, particularly VipRt and Sutudrī.</page><page sequence="7">Vflrahä ItidrA J ķP, óí poetic symbolism is, it may be pointécLout, quite undël- statídàble. But at least once in a while we should have come across Vedic passages which are unequivocably indicative- of the phenomenon of rain; Indeed Bérgaïgke seems to be right when he- suggests1 that there is, in the j(?T, no clear mention of India's being- responsible for the- rain-fall*. The symbolism of vajra; parvaia, pur , gauh9 etc;, can be- interpreted - and this, more or less- satisfactorily - in several ways. As a matter of fact it is actually interpreted variously. It is verily difficùlt to understand why the Vedic poets should have described thè basic character and exploits of their principal god in such vague and- indefinite terms . The identification of Indra with the rain-god is based on some other identifications, which seem to be taken for granted. India's vajra , for instance, is understood to be the regular mythological name for lightning. But do the Vedic passages referring to vajra support such an exclusive assumption ? The vajra is-ge'nerally described as âyasa or metallic ( I. 52.8 ; 57.2 ). It is said to be four- angled ( IV. 22.2 ), hundred-angled ( IV. 17.10), hundred-jointed ( VIII. 6.6 ), and thousand-pointed ( I, 80.12 ). It is sharp ( VII. 18.18 ), and Indra whets it like a knife ( I. 130.4; 55.1 ). Such descriptions are too specific to be regarded as symbolically indicative of lightning. Moreover, though vajra is Indra's special weapon, it is not the only weapon which he uses. He is sometimes described as being armed with a bow and arrows ( VIII. 45.4 ; 66.6, ii ; X. 103.2-3 ), oras carrying aňkusa ( X. 44,9 ). These latter descriptions can hardly be said to fit in with the rain-god-theory 5. Another equation, on which the rain-god-theory is based, is that Vrtra is the cloud-demon. Several objections can be raised against this equation. To begin with, it may be pointed out that the word 1 R V II, 185. * Accord id g to GRUPPE ( as quoted by HOPKINS, JAOS 36, 255 ), it was actually open to question whether Indra to the Vedic poeta themselves was a deity who gave rain. HILLEBRANDT has pointed out ( Fili III, 165 ) that Indra can be said to have been mentioned dearly as the giver of rains only in 6 passages in the These passages form but an: insignificant minority against those whioh speak of the deliverance of waters in general. * H ILLBBR^NDT has rightly pointed out ( Fif III, 165) that the vajra need not be neoessarily regarded as the distinctive oharaoterlstio of a storm« god</page><page sequence="8">8 Arndts of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute vtrfthra occurs frequently In the Avesta, That that word is philo- logically the ancient Iranian cognate of the^ Vedic word Vftra is beyond any shade of doubt, lna subsequent part of this paper, we shall have to consider the word vftra in all, its aspects. In the present context, however, it may be pointed out that, in the Avesta, the word wrsthra dots not signify a cloud-demon even remotely. Further, in the Avesta, we come across a god called Vrthragna, but he is in no way connected with the rains.1 Again, supposing that Indra was the rain-god in the Vedic mythology, no rational expla- nation can be given of the fact that Andra, who is obviously the ancient Iranian counterpart of Indra, is represented, in the Avesta, as an obnoxious demon, Why should a mere rain-god of the Veda have been transformed into the third worst devil in the Iranian mythology ? In the descriptions of the Indra-Vrtra-contest the Vedic poets have frequently used certain words and idioms in a more or less technical sense, such as, tor instance, api+dhâ, gras, bãdh, rudh , vr, stäbh, pari+stbä, etc. Hillebrandt has made a critical and analytical study of all such words and has come to the conclusion that they do not fit in well with the phenomenon of rain.® It will be thus seen that the descriptions, in the ĶV, of the Indra-Vrtra- contest are such as do not warrant the assumption that they indicate, primarily and unequivocably, the phenomenon of rain. Even if the symbolism in those descriptions were to be considered from the naturalistic point of view, it may be possible to interpret it in terms of some other natural phenomena as well. It does not, therefore, stand to reason to suggest, on the strength of such inde- finite evidence, that Indra was basically a rain-god. There is another significant point to be noted in this connec- tion. In the Vedic mythology there are three divinities, which are more or less closely connected with the phenomenon of rains : Trita Äptya, Parjanya, and Indra. From among these three, Indra seems to be later than the other two. As a matter of fact, Indra seems to have been added to the Vedic pantheon later than 1 According to SPIEGEL ( Arische Periode , 197 )¿ the regular rain-god of the ancient Iranian mythology is Tiitar. * VM III» 174-75.</page><page sequence="9">Vrtrahā Indra &lt;9 many other gods. The tradition preserved in the Taittirtya Brahmano ( II. 2.3.3 &gt; H* 2.7.2 ), namely, that Prajäpati created all, gods but not Indra, and that Indra was later generated among them as a new power is highly significant in this connection. Indra is referred to in the Taittirlya . Sathhitä ( II. 3.4.2 ) as devānām änujävara. Under these circumstances a question may occur : why did the Vedic poets feel the necessity of creating a new rain-god when they already had two in their pantheon. If, on. the other hand, it were suggested, for the sake of argument, that the concept of Indra is earlier than that of either Parjanya or. Trita Ãptya, it may still be asked, and, perhaps, with greater relevance, why the latter two apparently subsidiary rain-divinities should have been thought of by the Vedic mythologist when already there existed, in the Vedic pantheon, a very prominent rain-god, namely, Indra. As regards Parjanya, it might be argued that between Indra and Parjanya there is no absolute similarity. For, while Parjanya is the rain itself, Indra represents the rain-giving; god. 1 No such distinction can be made between Indra and Trita. Ãptya. The character of Parjanya, in the Veda, is quite transparent^ but that of Trita Aptya is rather vague and obscure. There are, in the ĶV, forty passages which refer to Trita Aptya, - and, taken collectively, they seem to indicate, albeit vaguely, that god's connexion with atmospheric waters. For instance, it is said that- when the mighty Maruts go forth, Trita thunders, and waters roar: wandering in their course ( V. 54.2 ). 8 Such a connexion can be confirmed also by an etymological consideration of the name-Aptya.' 1 It may, however, be incidentally pointed out that the magio charms for the bringing of rain are predominantly addressed to gods other than Indra. 2 Macdonell ( JRAS 1893, 419 ff. ) has tried to show that Trita Ãptya. represents the third form of Agni. He is, according to him, the divinity of lightning. The peculiar relationship between Indra and Trita cannot, however, be adequately accounted for if Macdonell'S view were to be acoepted* Moreover in V. 54'2, Trita is clearly distinguished from lightning. Also c/.: M. Fowler, J AO S 67, 59-60. Bloomfield ( JAOS XVI, cxix ) regarda Trita as scapegoat of gods. 3 Obviously, the word ãptya is philologically connected with op ( = water). GÜNTERT, however, tries to connect it, not very convincingly, with ãpih and interprets it as 4 friend* ( Weltkönig und Heiland, 33). X. RoNNOW ( Trita Ãptya : Eine vedische Gottheit . Uppsala 3927 ) holds that the original form of Trita's name was Trito - . He has dealt, in great detail, with Trita'a character as a spirit of the waters, lustratory genius, dragon-slayer, and the brewer and dispenser of Soma« % f Annals, Bs Q, F.

Though, in some passages, he appears as almost identical with Indra so far as his activities in connection with the rain-phenomenon are concerned (I. 187.1; VIII. 7.24 ), there is absolutely 110 doubt that Indra and Trita were distinct personalities. Again, it would become quite clear that though Indra also is called Aptya ( X. 120.6 ), Trita must have been the original Aptya. The earlier occurrence in the Avesta of the ancient Iranian counterpart of the latter, namely, Thrita, than that of Indra is indeed a significant point of evidence in this connection*. Uuta still more significant piece of evidence is RV'. 52.5, where ktdra is described as having performed the feat of conquering the min-stealers in the manner of Trita, This passage clearly shows that the function of overcoming the cloud-demons and releasing the celestial waters originally belonged to Trita, while, later on, Indra stepped into the shoes of that original Aryan rain-god and imitated him in the exploit of bringing rains. Trita's victory over the rain- stealers must have been regarded as so primary and characteristic an achievement of his as to be mentioned as an illustration ( I. 52.4-5 ; V. 86.1 ). Three distinct stages may be marked in the development of the rain-god-mythology in the Veda. The Vedic poets must have originally glorified the rain-god of their Aryan ancestors, qamely, Trita Aptya, This god thus found a place in the mytho- logie? of both the branches of the Aryans, namely, the ancient Iranians and the Vedic Indians. Later on, as the result of some peculiar mythological development among the latter, a new god 1 The ancient Aryan clans, who had specialised themselves in the preparation of Soma ( Haoma ), may have, later on, been named the Aptyas ( Äthwyas ). 3 The counterpart of Indra namely Andra appears in the Avesta at a later stage, and that too as a demon. In the Avesta , the personality of the Aryan Trita is, so to say, split up into two. As Thrita, he is connected with the preparation of Haoma, while, as Thraetaona, he slays the fiendish dragon ( Azi DahSka ).</page><page sequence="11">Vftraha Indrā- it càme to be regarded as the rain-god in the Vedic mythology. That god was Indra. But even after Indra's celebration as. a rain-goiiļ in the RV, the original Aryan rain-god was not altogether forgotten.' As shown above, Indra was described as imitating Trita in his feat of conquering the rain-stealers ( I. 52.5 ). There are, however, unmistakable indications in the R V that Indra was gradually super- seding the original rain-god. Whenever Trita appears with, Indra, the former is clearly represented as the subordinate of the lattei: ( II. it. 19-20 ; VIII. i2ii6 ; X. 8.7-8 ; 99.6).* Moreover, a large, number of Vedic passages referring to Trita are such as would: suggest that that god had been slowly but surely sinking into- oblivion. He is never presented in clear and life -like, form, bm is. mentioned in cursory allusions. Trita is said to be dwellingin the farthest distance ( I. 105.9 ; VIII. 47. 13-17 ), beeause, as.Roih rightly points out8, he had gradually become more: and more: obliterated from memory3. The fact that Trita is not at all mentioned in certain mandolas, such as, the second, the fourth, and. the. seventh - particularly, the seventh - is also highly, significant iņ this context*. This subordination of Trita by Indra represents the second stage in the evolution of the Vedic rain-god -mythology. In the last stage, Trita, who was the original Aryan god of storm and rain, indeed older than Indra, was completely shelved into the background as the result of the growing popularity of Indra as. thę rain-god. It is suggested' that dim reminiscence of Trita?s vanished glory and an allusion to his final subordination may be lurking in II. 34.10. Trita is there said to have been given over to the derision of the worshipper. All this discussion will have now made it amply clear that Indra was not the original rain-god of the Veda, 1 If closely studied, such passages seem to show that Trita and Indra have been oonnected with each other artificially and rather as the result of a. purposeful afterthought. Kosambi says ("Origin of Brahmin Gotras M. JBBRAS 26, p. 64 ) : ' Knowing what we now do of the Aryan invasion, it seems plausible that Trita is Indra or one of the invading Aryan chiefs, later collectively deified under the title of Indra'. * * Die Sage von Feridun ' ZDMG II, 221. 8 The few Atharvaveda passages referring to Trita also suggest the idea of a remote god. 1 It is not unlikely that there were originally quite a large number of Védio mantr as celebrating Trita; but they were not ail preserved owing to the definitely deteriorating position of that god. 4 E.D.PERRY.

It may be incidentally pointed out, in this connection, that the line of contact between the Indo- European stormgods on the one hand and Vedic Indra on the other is nowhere distinct or even provable. It should be further remembered that Indra is a god, who originated and grew specifically among the Vedic Aryans. If it were to: be supposed that he had been a rain-god from the very beginning, it would be difficult satisfactorily to explain why the Vèdic poets should have created a new rain-god of a specifically Indian origin. Moreover, the facts that Indra was elevated to the position of the national god of the Vedic Indians and that he came tó be regarded as the true symbol of their official religion cannot be adequately accounted for on the assumption that Indra's basic character was that of a rain-god. Why should a rain-god have been raised to that position in India, but not elsewhere ? There is one more point, which definitely goes against the assumption of Indra's basic character as a rain-god. As a matter of fact, that point can be raised, with equal relevance, against all naturalistic interpretations of the Indra-mythology. A more or less detailed reference will have to be made, in a subsequent part of this paper, to the human character of Indra as presented in. certain passages of the Veda. A careful study of such passages would at once convince one that they cannot have been the result of the humanization of an originally naturalistic divinity. Some details of the human aspect of Indra's personality, such as the mysterious manner of his birth, his assuming various forms, his peculiar interest in the welfare of unmarried girls, his great fondness for the intoxi- cating beverage, Soma, which is sometimes made fun of by the Vedic poets, and several others, which will be mentioned later, are so realistic and intimate that it would be difficult to believe that they are artificially superimposed on Indra's original character as a rain-god by the fancy of the Vedic poets. We have, therefore, to conclude that, though there are, in the personality of Indra as presented in the R F, certain elements normally belonging to the rain-god-mythology, these elements cannot be said to represent either thč primary or the exclusive traits of his basic character.</page><page sequence="13">Vftràhâ Jndřa īļ^ Hillebrandt has interpreted the Indra-Vrtra-wai itr quite a different light - though, again, mainly from the naturalistic point of view1. He had originally adopted the popular view that Indra is the rain-god of the Vedic pantheon. Later on, however, on a closer examination of the literature ( both Vedic and post-Vedic ) and ritual relating to Indra, he found it necessary to revise his views more or less radically. As indicated elsewhere, he started by criti- cally studying the words and idioms, such as api + dhã&gt; bâdh , yrdh,Vf; etę., which are frequently used in the descriptions of the evil deeds of Vrtra, from which Indra is said to have brought about deliverance. These words and idioms, according to him, cannot be understood to refer, even remotely, to the phenomenon of rain. Again, the parvatas ( or adri , aiman ), which also are often referred to in that context, do not signify the clouds8. As a matter of fact, clouds are distinguished from the parvatas , for, it has been said that the wings of the parvatas were cut off and that those wings became clouds. And, why should clouds have been regarded as demons ? In Indian literature, generally a cloud is hailed as the bringer of rains and not condemned as the obstructor of celestial waters. Hillebrandt has, therefore, suggested that the waters obstructed by Vrtra were not the celestial rain-waters, but that they were actually the streams of earthly rivers. According to him, the evolution of the Vedic mythology is not necessarily restricted to the geographical limits of India. He further points out that, so far as the Indra -Vrtra-legend is concerned, there is sufficient ground to assume that, in its original form, that legend was not indigenous to India, but that it was carried by the Vedic people from outside India to their new home. The season, in which Vrtra is described as lying on the mountains, cannot be the summer. In that season, the waters are not locked up ; on the other hand, the rivers are in spate as the result of the jnelting of the glaciers in the North-Western mountains. In the opinion of Hillebrandt, Vrtra is the winter-demon, who locks up the flow of the river-streams. At the advent of the spring, Indra, that is to say, the sun-god, overpowers Vrtra, the winter-demon, and releases the waters. It is the winter - and 1 VM III, 1902, pp. 155-344.

' In the winter, the streams in the North-Western region dwindle away. But as the mountain-snows melt, on the approach of t he Indian summer, followed by the rainy season, the waters, rise and overflow the surrounding country. 2 In support of his theory that Indra was primarily the sun-god, who conquered the winter-demon, Vrt ra, and thereby released the locked-up waters, Hsllebrandt has tried to adduce much evidence. In the frequent allusions to Vrtra as iayäna ( sleeping ), he finds a suggestion of the winter representing the 'sleep of nature In the Atharvaveda. fili. 10.12 ), Ekāstakā, that is, the new-year's night, is said to be the mother of Indra, thus implying that Indra is the symbol of the advent of the new year, that is, of the spring. One of the demons, killed by Indra, is called Rauhiņa. This may be but one of the many names by which Vrtra is referred to in the Veda. Hillebrandt interprets Rauhiņa as the moon, and confirms the identification of Vitra with the winter by pointing out that the moon is the lord* of- the winter. Coming to the Vedic ritual, Hillebrandt emphasizes the facts that the mid-day oblation ( madhyahna-savana ) is normally offered to Indra ( because he is the sun-god )s and that Indra is associated with grisma. 4 A careful examination of the evidence, adduced by the sponsors of the rain-god - thery and the sun-god - theory in support of their respective theories, would seem to show that these theories cancel each other. Broadly speaking* most of the objections raised, against the first naturalistic interpretation of the Indra-mythology, which has been .discussed above, can, with equal validity, be raised against this second naturalistic interpretation as well. It may be pQinted out, for instance, that Vrtra's counterpart in the Avesta does not signify the winter-demon even remotely. What, again, 1 HILLEBRANDT has supported this statement by means of several quota- tions from ancient and modern literature. * cf. Hunter, Atlas of India , p. 7, as quoted by HILLEBRANDT.

' If Indra were originally a sun-god belonging, as Hillebrandt suggests, particularly to the pre-Indian Vedic mythology, no satisfactory explanation can be given as to why he should have been condemned to the position of a demon in the ancient Iranian mythology. Further, there was already, in the Vedic pantheon, one sun-god, namely, Sûrya. What could have been the specific reasons for introducing a new sun-god ? As a matter of fact, Indra and the sun are often mentioned side by side thus indicating their distinct personalities (I. 32.4 ; 51.4» II. 12.7; III. 31. is ; VI. 17.3 ; 21.3 ; VIII. 12.30 ; X. 171.4). Again, the elevation of a solar divinity to the supreme position in the Vedic pantheon cannot be adequately accounted for. The .descriptions, in the 1?F, of the Indra-Vrtra-battle are such as produce the impression that that battle must have been parti- cularly violent and fearful ( I. 80.11 ; II. 11.9-10 ; VI. 17.9 ). In overpowering Vrtra, his vanquisher, Indra, had to perform .enor- mously terrific feats (I. 32.5 ; S7.6 ; 80.14). Such descriptions would appear quite incongruous when related to the spring-time sun. At the advent of the spring, the sun appears as a particularly life-giving and energising power rather than as a fearful giant. Further, it is to be seriously doubted whether the phenomenon of the dwindling away of rivers in the winter, even in the regions mentioned by Hillebrandt, was actually so very common and significant in the life of the Vedic people as to be made the .centrai theme of the mythology relating to their greatest god. The idea of glaciers, etc., which are supposed to be locking up the waters of the rivers, is nowhere unequivocally presented in the Ķ V. HiLLEBRAN.Dt's suggestions that Rauhiņa, as the moon, is the lord of the winter and thus represents the winter-demon killed by Indra, and that the references to iayâna Vrtra may poetically signify the c sleep of nature ' ( that is, the winter ) are obviously too far-fetched. Nor peed much weight be attached to the facts that the madhyâbna-r savana is assigned to Indra or that Indra is associated with the grif ma. Firstly, such assignments and associations are, more than anything else, the result of ritualistic schematism. And, secondly, 1 As pointed out by HOPKINS ( JA OS 36, 242 ff ), the use of stone and metal as synonymous with Indra's missile bar out the suggestion that hi« normal weapon might be the burning sun-beams.</page><page sequence="16">té Annals oj the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute if Hillebrandt's theory were to be accepted, Indra should have been connected with the vasanta rather than the grisma. Other features of the In dra-mythology, particularly Indra's close associa- tion with the Maruts and his proverbial fondness for the intoxicating beverage, would not fit in well with the sun-god-theory. The human elements in Indra's character are, as indicated above, too vital and realistic to be regarded merely as the result of anthro- pomorphic tendencies. It is, therefore, difficult to accept Hillebrandt's theory that Indra originally represented the sun-god'. 1 Several other variations of the solar theory have been proposed by soholars. Max MÜLLER, for instance, sees in the Indra-Vrtra-myth the symbolical description of the daily triumph of light over darkness ( Contri - bution to the Science of Mythology I, pp. 141-42 ). It may be recalled that he identified lndra also with Jupiter Pluvius ( Letters on the Science of Language ii, 470 ). He believes that Vptra is primarily the demon of darkness and that the vascillating of poetic imagery between dark night and dark cloud would be quite in keeping with the Vedic myth-making. B. G. TlLAK ( Arctic Home , 233 ff. ), who propounded the theory that Vedic mythology, as a whole, can be best understood only by relating it to the natural phenomena observable in the Arctic region, saw in Indra the sun-god, who overpowered the demon of darkness who dominated that region continuously for some months. V, A. Gadgil suggests ( ABOR1 XXIII, pp. 134 ff. ) that Indra and Varupa represent the two aspects of the central Vedic concept of rta, Varuņa, according to him, is the representative of the passive moral principle while Indra is the representative of the highest physical aspect of nature. Gadgil further suggests that the conoept underlying the Indra- Vrtra-myth is the eternal conflict between tejas and tamas. It may be pointed cut that GADGIL'S interpretation, besides not being supported by Vedio evidence, is far too abstract. It is indeed doubtful whether Vedio poets ever made a olear-cut distinction between the physical and the non-physical aspeots of nature. More or less the same thing can be said about the theory of FateH SlNGH ( JBHU 5), who sees in Indra the deity of universal light and energy. He interprets the myth of Indra's birth through the side of his mother as representing the first light of dawn which is visible in a circular way. R. SHAMA Sastri ( B. C. Law Comm. Vol. I, 277-281 ) connects the Vedic mythology with astronomical bodies and phenomena. According to him, Indra is the sun fighting with the eclipse-demon. Sambara, he explains ( Thomas Comm. Vol., 257-61), is an eclipse-demon of the type of Rāhu and Indra's battle with him represents a slow olearance of the eclipse. A reference may, in passing, be made also to the theory put forth by P. C. SENGUPTA ( " When Indra became maghavan ", JASBL IV, 445 ff. ) that Indra was the god of the summer solstice. Indra became maghavan when the sun at the summer solstice reaches the magha constellation, Acoording to SENGUPTA, this happened in 4170 B. C. He further identifies asiera with ahi and suggests that ahi means the clouds which were seen in the sky from the rising of aêleçã which did not yield rain till the rising of maglia ,</page><page sequence="17">Vftrahä Indra tf As a matter of fact, that scholar himself could not altogether over- look the fact that the elements relating to the phenomenon of raim are sufficiently prominent in Indra's personality. He, therefore, concluded that Indra was originally the sun, but, in the ĶV, is no longer the sun-god, while not yet a rain-god1. For, as he points out, the six passages in the R. V, which unequivocally refer to Indra as giver of rains, occur in the fourth, the eighth, and the tenth maydalas, which fact would indicate, according to him, that the character of Indra as rain-god was still not established in the Rgvedic times. Hillebrandt, however, does not seem to have taken into account the fact that several descriptions of the Indra-Vrtra-fight in the ļtV* though not necessarily indicative of Indra's essential character as rain-god, do indirectly imply the phenomenon of storm and rain. Those descriptions may not - and, as shown above, do not - prove that Indra was primarily a rain-god. But they do certainly indicate that, among the naturalistic elements superimposed on Indra's original character, those normally connected with a rain-god are more prominent. The foregoing discussion of the two principal naturalistic: interpretations of the Indra-mythology will have made it amply- clear that the naturalistic or cosmic elements could not have beèn^ either the basic or the primary elements in Indra's character8.; They clearly produce the impression of having been superimposed on the original personality of that god. Our aim will, therefore, . be, firstly, to find out what the original character of Indra must- have been, and, secondly, to describe and rationally account for the 1 VM III, 195-96. cf. Hopkins, op. cit. 8 Oldenberg has shown ( NO- 115 ) that the theme of the Indra-V ftra- fight is treated in all the mandalas of the ĘV • 3 The very significant remarks made in this connection by HOPKINS - ( Religions of India , p. 91 ) may be quoted here with advantage. HOPKINS says : 44 Indra has been identified with * storm ' with the * sky ' with the 4 year * ; also with the * sun ' and with 4 fire * íd general. But if he be taken as he is found in the hymns, it will be noticed at onoe that he is too 4 stormy * to be the sun ; too ( luminous * to be the storm ; too near, to the phenomena of the monsoon to be tķe year or the sky ; too 4 rainy * to be fire ; too alien from every one thing to be any one thing " 3 [ Annal», B. G. R. I, 3</page><page sequence="18">ļ8 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute circumstances under which the cosmic elements must have been, superimposed on his personality', One thing which would strike even a casual student oí the; Indra-mythology is the fact that in no other god of the Vedic pantheon are the features of human appearance ( ūkrli ) and character ( prahrti ) so conspicuously prominent as in Indra. A closer examina- tion of the descriptions of Indra's person and character would further convince one that so plastic a figure as his and so essentially human a behaviour as is attributed to him cannot be considered to have been thé result of mere anthropomorphism. It may be pointed 1 Some other theories regarding the basic character and personality of Indra have also been put forth by soholars. HOPKINS, for instance, believe® that Indra was originally a god of fertility {J AO S 36, pp. 242 ff. ). In support of his theory, that soholar has adduced evidence from the epic, popt-Vedip, and Vedic sources. In the epics, Indra is called pakaêãsana ( = orop-controller ? ), and the festival of Indra is always associated with harvest and fertility rather than with victory. In the Pãraskara GS (II. 17.9), Indra's wife is said to be Sita, that is, personified furrow. Indra figures as the foremost among the gods worshipped at the ceremony of first starting the ploughs (cf. Qobhila GS IV. 4.28). In A V 4.4.4, Indra is said to be responsible for putting virility in the oęadhis, Indra is described in the R V as urvarãpati ; he wins the tilth, is lord of tilth, as he is ìord of cattle ( II. 21.6 ; VI. 60.1 ; VIII. 21.3 ). Such references, according to HOPKINS, indicate that Iņ&amp;r? was first celebrated as a demon of fertility. He was then accepted as * the chief war-god among two or three clans. ( Hopkins has elsewhere - JA OS 37, 83 ff. - tried to show that the combination of gods of war and fertility is not uncommon ). From a war-god he was later on elevated to be tķe greatest god of the larger group of clans. Without examining, in detail, the views of HOPKINS, we may only point out that several of the objections raised against the rain-god-theory or the sun-god-theory can be raised, with equal appositeness, against the fertility-god-theory as well. The references to this aspect of Indra's character are clearly secondary and incidental. It is not unlikely that the hints regarding the power of fertility possessed by Indra are due to the combination of the elements of the rain- god and the sun-god, which were superimposed on his personality. It iq well known that the sun and the rain together oause fertility. One great draw-baok of the naturalistic and similar other interpretations is that their sponsors seem to view Vedic mythology as if it were a statio phenomenon. They forget that, in consonance with the various vicissitudes in the Vedic way of life and thought, there must have been inevitably effected significant modifications in the Vedic mythology as well. Therefore to emphasize only one aspeot of the personality of a Vedic god without taking into acoount the other aspects and . thereby try to determine the basio oharacter of that god is bound to prove a faulty procedure, It would lead but to a partial picture of the personality of that god.</page><page sequence="19">Vffrabã Indra 19 out that; as against the vague and indefinite naturalistic elements, the human features in India's personality are so realistic and life-like, that one feels inclined unhesitatingly to accept the latter as mofé basic and essential. Indra's body, head, arms, and hands are very often referred to ( II. 16.2 ; VIII. 85.3 ). He is said to be golden in colour ( I. 7.2 ). His body is gigantic ; his neck mighty ; and his back brawny. His arms are sleek, and his hands thick and firm - both right and left - being particularly well-shaped ( I. 80.5 ; 102.6 ; IV. 21.9 ; VI. 19.3 ; VIII. 70.1 ). He has hand- some cheeks ( or lips ), and is, therefore, often called suiipra ( II. 1 2.6 ; 3 3 . 5 ), ¿ipriti ( I. 29.2 ; III 36. 1 o ), or iipravān ( VI. 17.2 ). He is tawny-haired ( X. 96.5,8 ) and tawny-bearded ( X. 23.4 J. These and several other similar descriptions of Indra's person unmistakably produce before our mind's eye a very life-like picture of a tall, strong, well-formed, handsome, blonde Arç'an. Far more life-like, however, are the descriptions of some peculiar physical mannerisms of that god. He agitates his jaws ( VIII. 65.10 ), or puffs out his beautiful lips ( III. 32.1), in a characteristic fashion, in anticipation of or after the Soma-draught. Once he is described- very realistically, indeed - as shaking off the drops of Soma from the moustaches (II. 1 1 . 1 7 ). There are references to another peculiar movement of the upper lip, and to the shaking of the beard ( X. 23.1 ; 26.7 ). Such characteristic physical traits and manne- risms must necessarily be distinguished from the very general human traits attributed to a god as the result of the normal anthropomor- phic tendencies. Indra's appearance and mannerisms are so vety individualistic that they seem to have been derived from a specific human person. Another peculiarity, which clearly distinguishes Indra from other major gods of the Veda, is the fact that he is frequently referred to as having been born. Two entire hymns, namely, III. 48 and IV. 18, deal with the subject of his birth. In one of these hymns, Indra is said to have been born in an unnatural way, that is, through the side of his mother ( IV. 18.1-2 ). A special reference to such an unusual phenomenon would become meaning- less unless there had been in vogue, among the people, some such traditional belief relating to the birth of an actual human hero. As is well known, such miraculous birth is always associated, in the</page><page sequence="20">20 Annals oj the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute popular miiļd, with a great and - unique person'. It is further not unlikely that the reference to Indra's having killed his father in order to snatch away Soma from him and thus made his own mother a widow ( III. 48.4 ; IV. 18.12) is the result of popular myth- making based on an ordinary historical fact such as that Indra's father died suddenly soon after his birth8. Indra's miraculous power is said to have become evident as soon as he was born (VIII. .45.4-5 ). In X. 153.1, there isa reference to the infant god Surrounded by attendant women. Another interesting reference is tò be found in VIII. 58.15, where the immature boy, Indra, of head -strong temperament, is spoken of as having mounted a new wagon, and roasted, for his parents, a fierce bull. All these descrip- tions point unmistakably to the basic human character of Indra's personality. A reference has already been made elsewhere to the traditional belief that Indra is a later addition to the Vedic pantheon. This very significant tradition cannot be adequately explained except on the assumption of Indra's primarily human personality. It implies that Indra was not originally a god, but that he was a human hero who attained to godhead by virtue of his miraculous exploits. Hot only that, but he soon superseded the older gods ( VII. 21.7 ) and came to be regarded as the foremost among them ( II. 12.1 ). 1 Attention may be drawn to the myth regarding Alexander's alleged miraculous birth. Such myths do not affect the historicity of the hero about whom they are narrated. The naturalistic interpretations of this myth, such as that it may have been derived from the notion of lightning breaking from the side of the storm-cloud ( Macdonell, VM , 56 )t or that it refers to the first light of dawn, which is visible in a circular way ( Fateh SINGH, JBHU 5), are clearly unconvincing. According to W. Norman BROWN ( Siddheshwar Varma Comm. Vol., 1950, pp. 131-36 ), there is no necessity of assuming Indra's unnatural birth from his mother's side. He interprets the phrase, parsvānnirgamāņi , in the sense of * accompanying'. See also Brown, JAOS 62, pp. 93-95. 9 E. SlEG ( " Indra und der Somaraub nach dem RV ". Jacobi Comm. Vol. t 228-239 ) tries to correlate the apparently varying aocounts regarding Indra's nativity given in J? F III. 48 and IV. 18. Aooording to him, Vyaihsa ( IV. 18.9 ) seems to have been the father of Indra. This Vyaihsa was a DSsa and Indra killed him. Tvas^ā, on the other hand, mentioned in III. 48.4 and IV. 18.3, was Indra's ł great father ' ( III. 48.2 ), that is, Indra's maternal grandfather. SlEG accordingly says that Indra belonged to the Dāsas, on the father's side, and, to the gods ( Aryans ), on the mother's side,</page><page sequence="21">Vļirabā Indra 2t i'hislact is mythologically represented in a variety oí ways in the later Vedic literature ( TS II. 3.4.2 ; MS I. 9.4 ; TB II. 2.3;$ ; II. 2.7.2 ; .¿J? VIII. 4.12 ). But by far the most convincing proof of the essentially human character of Indra is the fact that the Vedic poets have often referred to what may be called the ' weaknesses' of that god. One such oft-mentioned weakness is Indra's proverbial fondness for Sóma. His immoderate indulgence in the intoxicating beverage is a favourite theme of the Vedic poets. Indra is spoken of as having gone to the extent of stealing Soma to quench his thirst ( III. 48.4 ; VIII. 4.4 ). He was somapã par excellence. But his was not merely an addict's passion for drink. For, Soma always exhilarated him to ■ carry out his warlike deeds ( II. 15. 1 ; 19.2; VI. 47.1-2 ; VII. 22.2 ; VIII. 81.6). For instance, in order to prepare himself for a decisive war with Vj-tra, Indra is described - of course, hypèrboli- cally - to have drunk three tankfuls of Soma ( V. 29.7 ). But the most significant sūkta , which must needs be mentioned in the present context, is X. 119. 1 In this sttkta, Indra is represented as being under the influence of an excessive draught of Soma and boasting of his greatness and capricious power. As Perry has rightly pointed out, a Indra's condition after a drink of Soma parodied in this sūkta is too realistic not to be considered human. It is a fine example of caricature and would remind one of modern newspaper caricatures - either in the form of humorous articles or of cartoons - in which innocent fun is made of some foible in the character of a great personage. No disrespect is, however, thereby intended. On the other hand, by light- heartedly poking at such a foible, that high personality is brought nearer to the hearts of the people, for, it indeed emphasizes his essential humanness. As a matter of fact, it is believed that such harmless foibles enhance, rather than detract from, the genuine greatness of that person. Indra, the human hero, must have been in the habit of indulging in a more or less sumptuous draught of Soma in order to invigorate himself before entering battle. This well-known habit of his seems to have been made the subject of a delightful parody in the Laba-sakta. 1 This sūkta is traditionally known as the Laba-sūkta, 1 Perry, op. cit.</page><page sequence="22">iż Annals of the Bhandàrkar Oriental Research Institute Similarly Indra is represented as an expert in female lore ( VIII. 33 ¿ 17 ). He seems to have taken a peculiar interest in the welfare of the children of unmarried girls (II. 15.7). As a domestic aider and as particularly interested in girls not yet married., he appears in the form of the ' little man ' invoked by Apãlà (.Vili. 91 ), who chews Soma-plant and prepares grain for him that he may make her friutful. 1 In A V ( VIII. 6.13 ), Indra is said to come to the help of a pregnant woman. Though Indra's amorous adventures arę nowhere clearly mentioned in the ĶV, there are, in it, few faint indications of that trait of his. character* These latter must have indeed been the basis of Indra's representa- tion, in later mythology, as a romantic figure - a € gay Lothario In the Ätharvaveda, Indra is once said to have been enticed away by an Asura female ( VII. 38.2 ). In another Vedic passage8, we are told that Indra, being enamoured of a dānavī , named Vilisteògâ, went to live among the Asuras, assuming the form of a female among females and of a male among males. A mention must also be made, in this context, of the famous Vrsākapi hymn ( X. 86 ). In that hymn, Indra is spoken of as having been exhausted when a bold, lascivious monkey administered to him some medicine, through which Indra regained his manly power. As shown in another paper*, this Vrsākapi is to be identified with the fertility-god Visņu. The whole episode may thus refer to Indra's efforts to preserve his virility intact5. Such descriptions of a more or less f intimate ' character must be understood to refer to the actual life of a human hero before he became the supreme god. 1 cf. Hopkins, op. cit. * cf. Hopkins, opš cit. S Kāthaha III, 47.9. It is not unlikely that this passage and the passage from the A V mentioned above ( namely, A V VII. 38.2 ) refer to one and the same incident. 4 DandekaR, " Vi§ņu in the Veda". Kane Comm. Vol.% pp. 95-111. 6 According to Macdonell ( VM, 64 ), this hymn describes a dispute between Indra and his wife, Indrāņī, about the monkey, Vrsākapi, who is the favourite of the former and has damaged the property of the latter. Vpsãkapi is soundly thrashed and esoapes, but afterwards returns, when a reconciliation takes place. PERRY ( J AOS 11 ) sees in this hymn a satirical description of Indra's domestic life. BRADKE ( Z D MC 46, 465 ) also considers the story to be a satire, in which, under the names of Indra and Indrāņī, a certain prince and his wife are intended. A critical study of the hymn would, however, show that none of these interpretations is satisfactory.</page><page sequence="23">Vrtrabä Indra 3 jķ It may be pointed out, *in this connection, that the Vedtc poets have never unnecessarily overidealised the character of Indra, which they would have done had he been primarily thought of as a god. Indra was essentially a man of this world, and, as such, he did not disdain deceiving his enemy or cleverly circumscribing the condi- tions of an agreement whenever circumstances so demanded'. Anpther very significant reference, so far as Indra's original character is concerned, is to be found in I. 32.14, where the mighty Indra is, said to have been overcome with fear when, after killing Vrt ra, he thought that some avenger of the enemy was following him. Such a reference would be hardly understandable in relation to a god, who had been conceived as a god from the very beginning. The Maruts are described as the constant associates of Indra m his mighty deeds. Indra is accordingly called marutvân and the Maruts are referred to as indrajyttfha2. But the proverbially harmo-* nious relations between the heroic leader and his loyal followers seem to have been disturbed on certain occasions ( I. 170.2 ; 171.6 ; VIII. 7.31 ). It was either cowardice or treachery on the part of the Maruts, which must have estranged them from Indra. Indra is represented as telling them, in derision, that they were not eager to accompany him when he went to the battle-field, but that, when' he was invited to a sacrifice, they did not want to leave him alone ( I. 163 ). This realistic legend relating to the temporary estrange- ment between Indra and the Maruts must have been based on an actual episode, and would thus prove the historicity of Indra as much as his essentially human character. The facts that Indra is described as wandering in various forms (I. 51.9; III. 53.8; VI. 47.18 )5, and that his enemies did not first realise the greatness of his prowess or altogether refused to believe in his very existence 1 cf. Indra-N amuei episode: V. 30.7 : VIII. 14.13. a For a more detailed discussion about the relation between Indra and the Maruts, see the concluding part of this paper. 2 Indra is said to have assumed, at different times, the forms of a woman ( Menã- cf. HILLEBRANDT, V M III, 172 ), horse's hair {cf. Geldner Ved . Stud. II, 183 ), an ant ( I. 51.9 ), a dancer ( I. 130.7 ; II. 22.4 ), etc. Also see VIII. 2.40. B. Geiger has connected the ten forms of the Avestan Vrthragna with Indra's transformations ( SAW Wien 1916, 69 ff. ). GüNTERT refers to the latter in connection with Visņu's varions incarnations ( Der arische Weltk'ònig , 308 ).</page><page sequence="24">24 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (II. 12.5 ) further confirm the primariness of the human traits in Indra's personality as well as his historicity. More prominently and frequently, however, than the mere human traits have the heroic traits in Indra's personality been celebrated in the RV. Indra's name itself verily comprises all notions relating to virile power. ł He is often very significantly called, or compared with, a bull, who was regarded as the symbol of such power ( I. 165. Il ; II. 16.4 ; V, 31.5 ; VIII. 1.1 ). Indra is superhumanly mighty (I. 80.15; VI. 21.10; VII. 21.7; VIII. 50.2); he is dreadful (1.84.2,7; II. 21.2); he is indeed invincible ( IV. 17.19 ; 30.3, 5 ). No one born, past or present, can rival him (I. 165.9 ). Several epithets expressive of excessive power, such as iakra, iaclvat , iatakratu , manasvãn, etc., are frequently attributed to Indra. Indra's susma and nrmņa ( II. 12.1 ) are often referred to and his eternal youth and vigour (II. 16. i ; III. 32.7 ; VI. 24.7 ; X. 86.11 ) have become almost the hallmark of his personality. But there is also another side to Indra's heroic character. He is exceedingly generous ( I. 30. 1 ; IV. 31.7; VIII. 14.4 ; 24.21 , 54.7 ; 70.3 ). He freely bestows goods and wealth on the pious man ( II. 19.4 ; 22.3 ; VII. 27.3 ) ; and this he can easily do, for, he possesses all treasures (I. 30.10; VI. 45,8). As a matter of fact, Indra's liberality had become so very characteristic of him that he almost entrirely monopolised the proud epithet, maghavä. 2 Indra's wisdom and prudence also are frequently celebrated in the R V ( I. 62.12 ; II. 16.2 ; VIII. 85.3 ), It will be thus seen that Indra's personality presents a curious combination of ' human ' and ' superhuman ' or ' heroic ' elements. As a matter of fact, it is this combination of the ' human ' and the ' super-human which makes Indra's personality so ' living ' and so attractive. The incongruity between the human aspect of Indra's personality characterised by sensuousness and similar other normal ' weaknesses on the one hand, and the superhuman aspect cha- racterised by miraculous powers, generosity and similar other traits of heroic perfection, on the other, is not due to the ' more intense anthropomorphism of Indra's nature '3. It is rather the result of 1 For a detailed philological study of the name • Indra ' see the sequel of this paper. 9 cf. yudht-vlra and dīina-vīra of olassical Sanskrit. * cf i MAODONELL, VM, 65.</page><page sequence="25">Vftrahâ Indra iļ the sincere efforts on the part of the Vedic poets to present a reali- stic picture of a historical human hero, who, while accomplishing almost superhuman deeds, still exhibited the essential humanness of his character. In the light of what has been said above, it would be very interesting to see how the Vedic poets approach their favourite national god, Indra, in varying attitudes - sometimes in a ' crouching, pusillanimous spirit and fear of his violence at other times, on remarkably intimate and friendly terms, but always exhi- biting great devotion and fidelity towards him, a firm belief in his miraculous powers and a ř touching reliance upon his goodness On the strength of the evidence adduced so far, we may now be justified in concluding that Indra must have been primarily a human hero - indeed, essentially a historical personality - , that, in course of time, he must have been elevated to the position first of a national war-god, and then of the supreme god, and that, later on, naturalistic or cosmic elements must have been superimposed on his personality.2 How can we account for this ' growth' of Indra's personality ? In order to be able to answer this question satisfactorily, we shall have to go back to the cultural history of the ancestors of the Vedic Indians. As indicated in another paper,* we may assume, on the strength of linguistic, archaeological, anthropological, and culture-historical evidence, that the proto-Indo-Europeans had their original home in the Ural - Altaic region. Some tribes from among this proto-IE stock migrated from their primary Urheimat towards the South- Eastern direction and ultimately reached the region around Balkh. There they lived for a considerable length of time before further migrations started from among them. As a matter of fact, these tribes remained in the region round about Balkh so long that they almost forgot their connections with their primary Urheimat- For our present purpose, it is neither necessary nor desirable to go into the » cf. perry, op. cit. % It may be pointed out, in this connection, that, from the anthropological point of view also, • naturalism ' as propounded first by Yãska and then by Roth, Max Muller, Oldenberg, Macdonell and others, often represents but a later stage in the development of mythological ideology. 8 Ďandekar.

I. ]</page><page sequence="26">%6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute details of this whole problem of the original home of the Indo- Europeans and their early migrations. It may only be pointed out that these people, who lived in the region of Balkh, were the proto-Aryans. In the initial stages of the proto-Aryan period, there took place some stray and desultory migrations mainly towards the South-Western Asiatic region. But, even after these small- scale migrations, the main stock of the proto-Aryans, which was. made up of the common ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient ( Avestan ) Iranians - who are popularly, and, from several points of view, appropriately, known as the Aryans - continued to live in the Balkh region for a pretty long time. It was indeed in this region that the ' Aryan ' language and religion attained ' characterisation In other words, the common primary form of the languages and the religions of the I? V and of the Avista must have evolved while the common ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians lived together in their common home in the Balkh region. The most characteristic feature of the religion of these people, which we may call the ' Aryan ' religion, seems to have been the concept of Asura Varuna.1 In the course of the evolution of their religious thought, the Aryans had realised that this universe, vast as it was, was not ' chaos '. Every single phenomenon- big and small - in cosmic as well'as human life was governed by some definite law. The universe was, as it were, magically ' bound ' down and thus strictly regulated. It was, in other words, ' cosmos The concepts of the cosmic law, rta, and of the administrator of that law, the cosmic-magician Varuņa, represents the most outstanding contribution of the Aryans to religious thought in general. In that age, the life of the Aryans had been so closely bound with nature, from several points of view, that it was but inevitable that they should have evolved the religious concept of the cosmic-magic-bondage. No doubt, there must have grown, among the Aryans, several other religious concepts and practices, such as, for instance, those connected with Soma-Haoma and fire; but the Asura-Ķta - concept seems to have completely dominated the Aryan religious ideology. 1 DANDEKAR. • Asura Varuņa ABO RI XXI, 157-91; alto aeę ' The ^»ce- dents eto.

As compared with the major primary migrations of the Indo-Europeans from their Urheimat in the Ural-Altaic region, the migrations of the Aryans from the Balkh region may be called the secondary migrations in the history of the Indo-European peoples. Some tribes from among the Aryans who were of a peace- loving temperament moved towards the Sòuth-West. Gradually, ¡ńid without having to encounter any serious hindrance, they migrated to the north of Iran and subsequently settled in that country. These were the ancient Iranians. As may be expected, they had brought with them, to their new home, the Aryan language and religion in their basic forms. Naturally enough, in course of time, the ancient Iranians must have developed the basic Aryan language and religion in their own peculiar mannet. The other Aryan tribes, however, were more ambitious and warlike. From their home in the Balkh region these adventurers set out on a mission of conquest and colonization towards the South-List. This, however, was not an easy task. On their onward march these" people, who were really the ancestors of the Vedic Indians, had to encounter serious opposition from several antagonistic tribes. Their gradual progress towards Saptasindhu, where they ultimately settled down, makes a long tale of a series of wars. But through all these wars, the early Vedic people were finally led to victory by a heroic compatriot of theirs, whom they very appropriately called Indra. It may be presumed that the tribes who tried to arrest the onslaught of the Vedic Indians came from various stocks. From the descriptions in the R.V, it would appear that they were racially and culturally quite different from the Vedic Aryan adventurers. They are generally said to have been black-skinned (I. 130.8; II. 20.7; III. 34.9 ), and snub-nosed (V. 29.10). Their speech was barbarous ( I. 174.2; V. 29,10; 32.8 ); they did not perform any sacrifices as the Aryans did ( I. 33.4; VII. 6.3; VIII. 70.11 ) ; they did not worship the Aryan gods ( III. 31.19; VIII. 70.11 ) ; and, above all, they did not recognise the national hero of the Vedic Indians, namely, Indra (IV. 23.7; VII. 18.16 ). These antagonistic tribes, who are variously described as having stolen away the cattle of the Aryans ( II. 12.3 ; III. 30.10; VI. 39,2 ), or ■ pent up the</page><page sequence="28">28 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research institute streams of the rivers ( I. 32.12; II. 12.12; III. 26.6; IV. 17.1 ),. or attacked the Aryans, from their secret recesses in the mountains ( II. 12. 1 1 ), or fought with them from their fortified settlements ( II. 14.6; 19.6; VIII. 17.14 ), are sometimes individually named,1 while, at other times, only the names of their leaders are mention- ed/ but, more often, they are all collectively referred to as the Dãsas ( I. 51.8 ; II. 12.10 ; X. 38.3; 86.19).' Indra, the young, blond, bearded, handsome, well-shaped, mighty, heroic leader of the Aryans, invigorated by a drink of Soma, is variously described as having protected the Aryans from the attack of the Dasyus ( VIII. 24.27 ) ; subjected the Dasyus to the Aryans ( IV. 18.3 ) ; put down the dâsa varņa (II. 12.4); overpowered the black- skinned foes (I. 13.8; III. 34.9); dispersed 50,000 of them (IV. 16.13 ) and rent their citadels (I. 51.5; IV. 16.13 )» sur" passed the Paņis in might (VI. 20.4; VII. 56.10 ), and recovered 1 Such as, for instance, Dasyu ( I. 100.12 ; II. 20.8 ; X. 99.7 ) ; Paņi ( VI. 20.4 ; 39,2 ; VII. 56.10 ) ; perhaps Ppthu and Parśu ( VII. 83.1 ). 9 Such as, for instanoe, Arbuda ( I. 51.6 ; II. 11.20 ) ; Asna ( II. 14.5; 20.5 ) ; Illbiśa ( I. 33.12 ) ; Uraņa ( II. 14.4 ) ; Krivi, ( II. 17.6 ; 22.2 ) ; Cumuri (VI. 26.6); Drbhlka ( II. 14.3 ) ; Namuci ( II. 14.5 ; V. 30.7-8; VI. 20.6); Pipru ( I. 101.2 ; II. 14.5; IV. 16.13); Rudhikrä (II. 14.5) ; Rauhiņa(I. 103.2 ; II. 12.12 ) ; Varcin ( II. 14.6 ) ; Vyamsa ( I. 101.2 ; 103.2 ) ; Sambara ( II. 12.11; IV. 47.21; VII. 18.20 ) ; Susņa ( V. 32.4; X. 22.4). * It is very likely, as Hillebbandt has pointed out ( VM III, 268 ff. ), that DSsa itself was originally the name of some inimical tribe, such as the Dahae, whom the Aryans must have encountered in the oourse of their early wanderings. Later on, however, that word came to be applied to any tribes hostile to the Aryans. These unfriendly tribes were referred to as the dãsa varņa ( II. 12 4 ), implying thereby that they were raoially distinct from the Aryans, or the dāsih viêah ( II, 11,4 ; IV. 28.4; VI. 25.2 ). In later mythology, Dãsas came to denote demons in general. The word, dasa&gt; is used in the RV in the sense of ł slave* only three times. Incidentally it may be pointed out that, though the words, dāsa and dasyu , are often used in the same sense, originally the word, dasyu , did not have the same meaning as the word, dãsa. Hillebrandt suggests that the antagonism between the Äryas and the Dāsas was of a political oharaoter while that between the Äryas and the Dasyus was more of a religious nature. Tavadia, howevor, affirms ( VBQ&gt; 1940 ) that Dasyu also was originally the name of a people or country and that the bad connotation came to be attached to that word at a later stage. Aocording to Kasten RÓnnow ( ł Vedic Rrivi' AO XVI, 161-80), the Dãsas mentioned in the Veda were the Naga-worshipping native tribes. He further points out that this serpent-cult predominated in the regions on the Himalayan slopes,</page><page sequence="29">Ýftrahá Indra ¿9 the cows ( X. 108 ). Many were the hostile leaders conquered by Indra.1 Many again were the Aryan chiefs and tribes to whom Indra is said to have rendered timely succour in several ways.2 The Aryan warriors soon learnt to depend on Indra's help and so constantly invoked him (II. 12.8; IV. 24.3 ). For, they looked upon him as their one compassionate helper ( I. 84.19; VIII, s 5 . 1 3; 69.1 ), as their deliverer and advocate ( VIII. 85.20 ), as their very strength ( VII. 37.5 ) - a veritable wall of defence ( VIII, 69.7 ). Never indeed did he fail them (X, 152.1). With his special thousand-pronged weapon, vajra ( I. 80.20 ), he smote down the barbarous enemies ( I. 101.5 ; VI. 23.2 ), and gave land to the Aryans ( IV. 26.2 ). He thus assured for them a smooth career of conquest and colonization. It is, therefore, no wonder that such a leader should have soon become a national hero and then a national god of the Vedic Indians.3 A warring people would naturally glorify to the utmost a warlike god.4 This heroic god of battle, though a later addition to the Vedic pantheon, soon sur- passed all earlier gods ( III. 46.3 ), who yielded to him in might and strength (VIII. 51.7). Even, the important older gods subordi- nated their power to Indra's divine glory and kingly dignity ( VII. 21.7 ). This elevation of a national hero to the supreme godhead must be assumed to have belonged to a period subsequent to the bifurcation of the Iranian Aryans and the Indian Aryans. Such an assumption alone would rationally explain why Indra is tradi- 1 See foot-note 2 on page 28 above. It should be noted, in this connection, that the descriptions, in the ĘVt of many of Indra's warlike expolits are such as dearly produce the impression of actually being the accounts given by eye- witnesses. 8 The ĘV refers to Indra's benefactions to Kutsa ( V. 29.10 ), Turvasa and Yadu ( II. 15.5 ; V. 31,8 ; VI. 45.1 ; VIII. 10.5 ), SudSs ( VII. 19.3 ; 20.2 j 32.10-11 ; 33.1 ), Mudgąla and Mudgalãn! ( X. 102 ) ; Kaksîvat ( I, 51.13 ), etc. 8 Suoh a historical interpretation of the evolution of the Indra-myth alone would explain why, in no other Indo-European mythology - not even in the Avestan mythology - do we find an exact counterpart of the Vedic Indra. 4 H. Lommel ( Der arische Kriegsgott ) emphasizes the basic oharaoter of Indra as the Aryan war-god. L von. SCHROEDER ( Herakles und Indra , Wien 1914 ) suggests that the many common traits in the oharaoter of Indra and Herakles would indicate their common origin. PlGGOTT ( Prehistoric India , p. 260 ) rightly points out that Indra is the apotheosis of the Aryan battle-leader.</page><page sequence="30">$o Ànnaìs of the Bhandarkar Qfiental Research Institute tionallyregarded as devänäm ânujàvara, and why this supreme god of the Vedic Indians should not have found place in the Avestan pantheon. Such then is briefly the story of the genesis of Indra's godhead. One thing, however, must be necessarily emphasized in this con- nection. It will be easily realised that all the warlike exploits, which, in the ĶV, are attributed to Indra, could not have been accomplished by one single individual. Many of them must certainly fall to the credit of the historical hero. But when history becomes mythology, an individual also tends to be more or less turned into an institution. Such is normally the course of mythological development, particularly in the Veda. When, therefore, the historical Indra was transformed into a national war-god, all mighty deeds of prowess- real or imaginary - came to be regarded as his handiwork. It may also be pointed out, in this context, that the warriors of the Vedic age invoked Indra for help not only in their battles with the Dãsas and other inimical tribes. There was a period in the history of the Vedic people when different Vedic tribes fought among themselves. In such civil wars, both sides invoked Indra for help (II. 12,8). Indra is, therefore, often described, in the R V, as the valiant vanquisher of the Däsa foes as well as of the Arya foes ( VI. 22.10; 33.3; 60.6; VII. 83.1; X. 69.6 ). This fact would again confirm Indra's essential character as a war-god. This elevation of a historical hero to the position of the national war-god of the Vedic Indians was accompanied by the superimposi- tioh, on the original character of lndra, of certain features which were derived from a significant mythological concept belonging to the common Aryan period. It has already been pointed out that the most predominant religious concept, which was ¿volved during the Aryan period, was that of AsUra Varuņa. Side by side with that concept there were evolved, in that period, other religious concepts and practices as well. One such religio - mythological concept was that of Vftra - Vjtrahan. A very detailed study of this concept has been made by Benvehiste and Renoü in their excellent monograph, Vf tra et VfOragna1. These scholars have shown, in a ' BenvenISTE, E. and Renoo, L. Vrtra et Vr&amp;rayna : Etude de mytho - logie indo-iranienne. Paris 1934.</page><page sequence="31">Vftrahâ Indra $T convincing manner, that the basic idea suggested by the linguisti- cally cognate words, vrtra in the Ķ V and vrthra in the Avesta, has been conserved only in the Avesta. These words have to be derived from the root *var meaning 'to resist'1. From that root, the neuter substantive, vrtra, is formed2. The original sense of the word vrtra is, therefore, merely ' resistance &gt;s. In the Avesta, the concept is never personified. The word vrthra is never found there to have been used to denote the agent of resistance. In the Ķ V also, the word is very frequently used in neuter plural - vrtrāņi. These facts would show that, during the common Aryan period, there existed among the ancestors of the ancient Iranians and the Vedic Indians a more or less general concept of vrtra - vrthra, that is to say, resistance. Closely related to that concept there also evolved the equally general and colourless concept ot Vftrahä - vrthragna - the divine power which overcomes such resistance4. It must be emphasized that neither the çoncept of vrtra nor that of vrtrahan had originally any specific physical or human basis. In a sense, they were more or less ' abstract ' concepts.5 The elevatioņ of Indra to the position of the national war-god - which mytho- logical phenomenon was restricted only to the Vedic Indians - conferred a new meaning on the vrtra - vrtrahan concepts. Those ' abstract ' concepts were, so to say, given some ' concrete ' basis in the course of the development of Vedic mythology. The historical hero, Indra, overcame a number of human foes who had ' resisted ' the onward march of the Vedic Indians. These human foes, thus, 1 Yãska (Nir, II. 5) derives (he word vrtra from the root vr (= to oover ), the root vrt ( = to roll ;, or the root vrdh ( = to grow ) . 3 Compare, in this connection, similar formation mitra from the root # m{e)i- ( = to bind ) [ vide Dandekar. 1 Asura Varuņa' ABORl XXI, 157-91 j. * Particularly resistance in a defensive sense. The Avestan usages point tQ the faot that vrthra is often the counterpart of ama ( = the power of offence ). The significance of 'victory ', which is conventionally attached to that word is quite erroneous. This is confirmed by the examination of all i^s Qompounds and of all the adjectival epithets applied to it in the Avesta. 4 It is suggested that Vrthragna is one of the pre-Zoroastrian deities opposed by Zoroaster, but afterwards introduced into his religion. • As pointed out by Bailey ( BS08 VII, 975 ), the interpretation of the expansion of the Vpthragna worship gains muoh from the consideration, in th* monograph by Benveniste and Renou ( pp. 68 ff. &gt;, of Hellenistic Ąrtagnes, Armenian Vahagn , Chorasmian Arthagn , and Sagdian Fosayn,</page><page sequence="32">Annals of the ßhandarkar Oriental Research Institute naturally, came to be looked upon as the Vjrtras1. And correspond ingly the more or less colourless and abstract divinity, which over- came resistance, namely, Vrtrahan, came to be merged into the historical hero, who actually overcame the human Vrtras2# A Vedic Indian historical current and an ancient Aryan mythological current thus combined to evolve the later Vedic mythological concept óf Vrtrahã Indra. As against this, among the peaceable ancient Iranians, there was no scope for such historical concrétisa- tion of the concepts of Vrtra - Vrtrahan. Those concepts have, therefore, conserved their original abstract sense in the Avesta s. It i Buddha Prakash suggests ( ABORĪ XXX, 163 ff. ) that the Vrtras defeated by the Vedio Aryans actually represented a specific pre-Vedic Indian people. Heis inclined to identify them with the Veretatae or the Oraturae mentioned by Megasthenes in Indika . Buddha Prakash further points out that the Vrtras possessed the elements of the Dasyus and the Asuras, that their habitat was the Himalayan range of the North-West ( Incidentally it may be mentioned that, while discussing the question of 4 The Cradle of the Indra-Vrtra Myth*, K. Chattop ADHY aya [ Proc. VI AIOCt 529-33 ] suggests that Semireohinsk in Pussian Turkestan [ which, according to -him, is identical with the Vedio Saptasindhu ] must have been the region where that myth o ame to be evolved ), and that their religion was characte- rised by serpent-symbology (cf. in this connection RoNNOW's views mentioned in foot-note 3 on page 28 ). Considering, however, the facts that the word, vrtrãni , occurs in neuter plural, that the Vptras both among the Xryas and the DSsas are mentioned in the Ę V, and that, in the Avesta, the word, vrthra , ooours without any historical significance, it is difficult to accept the identi- fication of the Vrtras with any speoific people. Vrtrāņi indicates foes in general. 2 That the concept of Vrthragna is specifically Aryan, and, therefore, earlier than that of Indra, which is specifically Indian, is confirmed by the fact that the word, Vrthragna, occurs in the earlier strata of the Avesta, such as the Sírõzah, the Yašts, and the Āfrigans, while the word Andra, representing the demonisation of the Vedio god, Tndra, ooours only in the later strata, as also by the fact that, in the Avesta, the concept of Vrthragna receives a more or less detailed treatment, while that of Andra ooours only in a casual manner. As a matter of faot, the name Andra occurs, in the Avesta, only twice ( Vid. X. 9 ; XIX. 43 ). 3 It would not be logical to suppose that the Vedio Vptrahā Indra was the original concept and that it was separated into two independent concepts in the Avestan mythology. For, as Keith points out ( IC I, 461 £f. ), it is more natural for India to unite ideas than for Iran to separate them. Moreover it would not be adequately understandable why, if the Iranians had actually separated into two the concept of Vptrahā Indra, the epithet, namely, VftrahS, should have been regarded as divine, while the substantive, namely, Indra, should have been regarded as demoniac.</page><page sequence="33">Vf traba Indra ļ} must .be pointed out, in this connection, thát, even in the ĶF, the frequent occurrence of the neuter plural, vj irāņi ( VI. 22.10 ; 60.6 ; VII. 83.1 ), betrays the original impersonal and abstract connotation of the word. The history of the concept of Vrtra is closely linked up with the course of the evolution of the Indra - mythology as a whole. Originally the word, vrtra, significantly used in neuter gender, expressed the general idea of ' resistance It was in no way connected with the concept of Indra, which, as a matter of fact, had not then even arisen. This was the state of things in the common Aryan period. When the historical hero, Indra, came to be glorified among the Vedic Indians, they personified the imper- sonal concept of Vptra, which they had inherited from their Aryan ancestors. Vrtras then came to denote the human foes, whom Indra, the national hero of the Vedic Indians, valiantly put down. Soon Indra, the national hero, was deified by the Vedic poets. Corresponding to this deification of the human Indra, there took place the demonisation of the human Vrtra. At this later stage of the Rgvedic mythology, the historical human Vrtras were collecti- vely transformed into the one ' demon ', who prominently opposed Indra, the great god. And still later, when naturalistic elements came to be superimposed upon Indra's original personality so that Indra came to be regarded as the rain-god, there was a correspond- ing naturalistic transformation of Vrtra's personality so that he came to be looked upon as the cloud-demon1. It will now become perfectly clear why, in the Avestan mythology, there is a divinity, Vrthragna, but no demon, Vrthra ; why the Avestan Vrthragna and Andra are in no way connected with each other ; why, in the ĶF, Vrtrahan lost his character as an independent divinity and that word became merely an epithet of Indra ; and, finally, why in the ĶV, the word .vrtra, is employed, in neuter plural, to denote the human foes, and, in masculine singular, to denote a demon. Ir has been already pointed out that the origin of the religious practices connected with Soma-Haoma must be traced back to the 1 It would thus be clear that Vrtra originally represented neither the cloud, as suggested by the Nairuktas, nor the demon-son of Tvastr, as suggested by the Aitihāsikas. 9 [ Annalt, B. O, E. I. ]</page><page sequence="34">54 Annals of the Bhandarkat Oriental Research Institute common Aryan period. The ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians., who lived-together in the Balkh region, must have soon discovered the remarkable properties of the Soma plant, which grew in abundance on the slopes of the Mūjavat mountain situated close to their common habitat. The intoxicating juice extract- ed from this plant must have been originally used in connection with Some primitive magic ritual. Anthropological investigations would amply testify to the practice of the primitive priests taking some "such intoxicating decoction with a view to producing in themselves a peculiar magic-orgiastic ecstacy'. With the rise, among the Vedic Indians, of the valiant hero, Indra, Soma-drinkiug came to be naturally associated with him. It may be said that, in a sense, the intoxicating drink began to be used for a purpose which cannot be said to have been strictly ritualistic. A draught of Soma, before entering battle, would banish all fear from the hearts of the warriors and put new vigour in them. This must have indeed been a most common experience.1 It is quite understandable that Indra, the warrior-leader, should have been described as indulging in the Soma-drinking more freely than others. As a matter of fact, in course of time, immoderate indulgence in the Soma-drinking came to be regarded as a distinctive trait of Indra's character - at once the strength and the weakness of the national hero. And, as shown elsewhere, the Vedic poets have actually treated it as such in their glorification of Indra. Indra becam z somapâ par excellence. ( II. 12.13 )• He is often described, in the RF, as being exhilarated by a drink of Soma to carry out his warlike deeds( II. 15. 1; 19.2; VI. 47.1,2; VII. 22.2; VIII.81.6). Whatever Indra accomplished he owed to the magic power of Soma. Sometimes, however, the Herculean head of the hero must have become befogged by an overdose; and it is such a condition which has been beautifully caricatured by a Rgvedic poet in X. 119. The Vedic poets refer to Indra as a ' thirsty stag ' ( VIII. 4.10 ), or a ' thirsty bull ' ( I. tjo.2 ), or a 'thirsty buffalo' ( I. 16. 5 ). Indra is so eager for a drink that he cannot wait until 1 vide, for inatanoe, O. Pertold. ' The liturgical use of Mahuda Liquor by Bhíls. ' Arch Or.

' 1 The concept relating to Soma is thus the second Aryan religious concept - the first being the Vrtra-Vrtrahan-concept - which has been combined with the Vedic Indian historical concept of the national hero. The more or less secular significance with which the concept of Soma came to be endowed on account of its connection with the historical warrior, Indra, must, however, be considered to have been but a temporary phase. With the elevation of Indra to godhead and the gradual development of the regular Vedic ritual, Soma again attained, in the fullest possible measure, its original magico-ritualistic significance ( which, as indicated above, it must have never lost altogether ), and Soma-worship became a very pro- minent feature of the Vedic religion.*' In view of the continued warlike activities of the Vedic Indians, it was but natural that they should have elevated their national' war-god, Indra, to the supreme godhead in their pantheon.4 This gesture on their part gave rise to quite a serious mythological upheaval. It will be remembered that Asura Varuņa was the supreme god of the common religion which the ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians had evolved. This Asura - dóminated religion was inherited both by the Indian Aryans and the Iranian Aryans* The Iranian Aryans seem to have faithfully stuck to that religion. As a matter of fact, in the normal life of those people, there does not seem tp have occurred any very significant event, which could have in- fluenced their religious ideology to any appreciable extent.

The Haoma is not referred to in the Oāthās of the Avesta. This silence is probably significant. In his religious reform, Zoroaster seems to have rejeoť ed Soma-worship. RÖnnöW ('Vedic Krivi' AO XVI, 161-180 ) believes that Soma onoe belonged to the Nāgas and was sacrificed for them.

The case of the Vedic Indians, on the other hand, was essentially different. As has been already pointed out, the Vedic Indians were ambitious adventurers. They, therefore, set out on a career of warlike activities, valiantly fighting their way towards the Saptasindhu country. In this their new career, they must háve found that the cosmic-magic Asura-religion, which had come down to them from their Aryan ancestors, was not at all adequate. A warring people, as suggested above, necessarily wants a war-god -rather than a god presiding over cosmic law - as their supreme god. The Vedic Indians, therefore, transformed their national heřo, Indra, into such a war-god, and, in consonance with their new way of life and thought, worshipped him as their greatest god. Thus, in the religion of the Vedic Indians, Indra ultimately super- seded Asura Varuņa. In other words, the new Vedic religion pre- vailed over the ancient Aryan religion. A critical study of the ĶV would show that, in that Veda, three distinct phases of the relation between the ancient Varuņa-religion and the new Indra-religion can be clearly marked. Some passages in the RV ( 1.34.6 ; 25.10; II. 27.10 ; VII. 87.5,6 ; VIII. 41.7 ; X. 132.4 ) are still found to glorify Varuņa as the world-sovereign. They thus seem to preserve the memories of the religious ideology of the pre-Indra Aryan period. This represents one phase. The major portion of the Ķ V, however, clearly indicates that Varuņa - religion was being put into the background and the Indra-religion was aggressively coming to the forefront. The RV hymn, IV. 42, is a highly significant document in this connection. Varuņa is shown in that hymn to assert his right to supremacy and to adduce valid reasons in support of his claim ( st. x -4 ). Indra is made to say that Varuņa's arguments did not concern him in the least and that, in virtue of his being the strongest god, he- Indra- must necessarily be regarded as the supreme god ( st. 5-6 ). Eventually the poet recognises unreservedly the, supremacy of Iņdra ( st. 7 ). This hymn thus represents, in an unmistakable manner, the supersession of Varuņa by. r</page><page sequence="37">Vflrahâ Tnâra ýj índra.1 According to Perry,* another hymn, namely, Ķ V X. 124, exhibits the transference of supremacy from Varuņa to Indra in a very peculiar light. Agni is there represented as abandon- ing father Varuņa and going over to Indra. The fact that hardly a dozen hymns in the ĶV celebrate Varuņa exclusively while Indra is glorified in nearly 250 hymns is again clearly indicative of Indra's ascendancy over Varuņa.3 As will be shown later, this mythological supersession of the Asura by Indra, which represents another phase of the Indra-Varuņa-relationship, gained a peculiar significance from two points of view- first, from the point of view- of the relations between the Vedic religion and the Iranian religion, and, secondly, from the point of view of the political history of the Vedic Indians. Still another phase of the relationship between these two mythological currents is marked by a spirit of compro- mise. It must be remembered that, even among the Vedic Indians, there were some tribes who continued to adhere to the Varuņa- religion. They must have, however, seen the signs of the changing times. Instead of either giving up the Varuņa-religion altogether or dogmatically sticking to it in the face of the generally prevailing Indra-religion, they, very wisely, tried to bring about an honoura- ble compromise between the two religions. They argued that, after victory is won by the war-god, Indra, Varuņa is needed to establish law and order. ' Indra conquers and Varuņa rules ' - this was their slogan ( VII. 83.9 ). Such attempts at a religious compro- 3 According to HILLebrandt, RV IV, 42 oontains only a sharp defini- tlon of the provinces of the two divinities. There is no suggestion of transfer of power from Varuņa to Indra. It may, however, be asked : if it was merely a sharp definition of the provinces of the two divinities, why should Varuņa try so much to assert his claim? On the other hand, in view of the warlike character of the Vedic Indians, the supersession of a cosmic god by a war- god would be quite logical. s op. cit . * In the Sunaļisepa legend in the Ait. Br. ( VII. 13-17 ), Indra is re- presented as approaching Rohita, in the disguise of a purusa, and dissuading him from going back to his father, Hariścandra, who wanted to sacrifice him to Varuņa. Indra's interference in this connection is entirely fortuitous and may only be reminiscent of the ancient rivalry between him and Varuņa. Indra perhaps did not want that a sacrifice should be performed in honour of his rival, Varuņa.

The separation between the two branches of the Aryan stock - namely, the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians was, as shown above, the result of normal historical migrations. These latter, however, it must be remembered, were governed by temperamental differences amoftģ those people. The cultural contacts between these two branches, it may be presumed, continued even after their separation. The Ahura-Mazdah-religioti of the Iranian Aryans was closely akin to the Asura-Varuija-řeligíotí' of the Vedic Aryans, for, both of them had been developéd out of a "common religious ideology of their Aryan ancestors. The rivalry between the Asura-VarUņa-religion and the Indra-religion, which is' an outstanding event in the religious history of the Vedic Indians, could not, therefore, have failed to influence the ancient Iranian religion as well. As was to be expected, among the war-like* Vedic Indians, Indra superseded Asura Varuņa. The ancient Iranians, on the other hand, were essentially peaceable and ethically inclined people. Nothing seems to have happened in their history to loosen the strong hold which the cosmic law-giver, Asura, had on their minds. The Ahura-religion, therefore, con- tinued to prevail unchallenged among them. As against this, they regarded the Vedic Indian Indra-religion as more or less upstartish. The Somâ-drinking war-god of the Veda did not suit their way of life and thought, Not only this, the Vedic Indra, with all his virtues and weaknesses, must have become definitely reprehensible in the eyes of the die-hards among them. The most natural result of this attitude of theirs was that they came to regard Indra as not only undivine but positively demoniac. .

In a late phase of their mythology, therefore, they represent- ed Indra as Andra, the third worst devil'. The religious conflict between Indra and Asura Varuņa may have gained a peculiar significance from the political pioint of view as well. Under the victorious leadership of their war-god, Indra, the Vedic Indians conquered several antagonistic tribes who resisted their onward march. As indicated above, these foes of the Vedic Indians are referred to, in the ĶV, under the general name, Däsas8. It is, however, possible to derive from the ĶV, more specific 1 The representation of Indra as a demon in anoient Iranian literature has prpved a knotty problem in comparative mythology. This ourious mytho- logical phenomenon has been accounted for in several ways. Martin Hau G, for instance, suggested that it was the result of a conflict between the Asura- religion and the Deva-religion, which arose among the Indo-Iranians, Some other scholars attributed Indra's demonhood to his immoderate indulgence in the intoxicating beverage, Soma, which trait of his character must have been found to be revolting against the essentially moral tone of Zoroaster's religious reform. Still other scholars see in the demon Andra of the Vendidad the reflection not of the Vedic Indra but of the less reputable Indra of the Purãnas. GRAY ( Iran . Rei. ), who regarded Indra as primarily a rain-god, believed that, in India, Indra brought the beneficent rains of the monsoons, while, in Iran, he is associated with the malaria- bringing heavy rains of winter. This would explain, according to him, why, in the Iranian mythology, Indra is looked upon as a malevolent power. Still another view is that Indra's original nature as a fęrtility-god must have gone against the grain of the sophisticated Ahura-religion. Chattopadhyaya considers ( Proc. IV AIOCt 11-24 ) Indra's demonhood to have been the result of an individual poet's fancy. He refers, in this connection, to the fact that Milton filled Satan's camp with the gods of the people neighbouring the land of Israel. According to M. A. SHUSTERY {Proc. III Al OC, 109-112 ), Indra has Rustam for his counterpart in Persia. There are several points of similarity between the two. The faot that the Avesta is silent about Kustam is explained by SHUSTERY by presuming that Kustam was the hero of the ancient Iranian mythology but was not accepted as such by the new religion of Zoroaster. H. GlJNTERT (Der arische Weltkonig , 57 ff. ) has pointed out that Mithra in the later Avesta has inherited certain popular traits in Indra's character. B. Geiger, for instance, notes ( SAW Wien 1$16, 176, 7, 74) the similarity between Indra's vojra and M ithra's vazra. A. Egg ER S ( Der arische Gott Mitra , 40 ff. ), on the other hand, thinks - curiously enough that it was Indra who inherited the warlike features in Mithra's character. 8 The word vrtra normally denotes an enemy in general - whether he be Ärya or Dāse.</page><page sequence="40">40 Annals of the ßhandarkar Oriental Research Institute historical details at least in some respects. One of the epithets exclusively attributed to Indra, in the Ķ Vy is pur andar a. By way of explaining the significance of this epithet, I had put forth' the following hypothesis. In the course of their onward march into India, the Vedic Aryans must have come across a people who lived in fortified settlements ( purah ). The civilisation of this people, which was characterisd by pur ( = fortified settlement ), must have become conspicuous in the eyes of the Vedic Indians on account of its sharp contrast with their nomadic tribal life. These purah , it may be presumed, represented the last phase of the great Indus Valley civilisation, particularly that aspect of it, which had developed in the region of Harappa. These Harappa people seem to have stubbornly resisted the progress of the Vedic Indians. Their forti- fied settlements must have certainly stood them in good stead - at least to a certain extent. But, after all, their opposition was but the last gasp of a people with a more or less exhausted civilisation. Indra, the national hero of the Vedic Indians, seems to have shattered their many purah ( I. 51.5 ; II. 14.6 ; 19.6 ; VIII. 17.14 ) and ultimately vanquished them. The connection between the Indus Valley civilisation and the Vedic civilisation can thus be historically explained. To purandara Indra belongs the credit of having finally brought to an end the ancient Indus civilisation, which was already on its last legs, and of having established, in its place, the Vedic civilisation, which was infused with new life and vigour2. As is well known, the Indus civilisation exhibits several affinities 1 Dandekar.

This hypothesis gets confirmation from the arohaeologioal excavations recently oarried out at Harappa. cf. R. E. M. WHEELER. • Harappā 1946 : The Defences and Cemetery R. 37 ' Ancient India 3, pp. 58-130. The identification of the Dasyus and the Dāsas - of dark skin and flat noses and possessing cities - with the inhabitants of HarappS and Mohen jodaro, who had, among them, a large proportion of proto-Australoids, is, according to PlGGOTT ( Prehistoric India , 261 ), almost certain. Accord- ing to KOSAMBI ( 1 Origin of Brahmin Gotras ' JBBRAS 26, p. 49 ), the myth of Indra killing a demon to free the pent-up waters is to be understood in the sense of Indra's having shattered the river-dams constructed by the Indus people. Tremendous prehistoric dams of this sort still exist a little to the West of Mohenjodaro. But releasing of waters by Indra was a source of joy to the people. This point does not seem to fit in well with XQSAMBI'S suggestion.</page><page sequence="41">Vf traku Indra 4 1 with the Assyrian civilisation. It may be presumed that the Aryans had already become familiar, directly or indirectly, with the civili- sation of the Assyrians. When, therefore, the descendants of those Aryans, namely, the Vedic Indians, encountered a civilisation which showed affinities with the. civilisation of the Assyrians, namely, the Indus civilisation, they must have straightway connected the latter with the civilisation of the Assyrians or the Asura people. They must have thus found the counterpart of the religious conflict between Indra and Asura Varuņa also in the political sphere, namely, in the form of the conflict between the Indra-people and the Asura-people,that is to say, between the Vedic Indians on the one hand and the Indus people, who were culturally akin to the Assyrians or the Asura-people, on the other.' The philological consideration of the name Indra would fully confirm the basic heroic character of the god Indra. It should be remembered that Indra is a specifically Indian name, and that, in no other Indo-European languages, except the ancient Iranian' and the Mitannian,' is its cognate form evidenced. A reference has already been made to some of the attempts made by scholars to give the derivation of the word, Indra * It has also been pointed out 1 It is interesting to note, in this connection, that, in the Avesta , the word daeva ( deva ) ( Vid. X. 9 ; XIX. 43) - opposed to ahura denoting the mighty god - came to mean a ł demon'. As against this, in later Sanskrit, the word asura - as opposed to deva ( Indra )-oame to be used in the sense of a 4 demon It must be pointed out that asura is the original word, while the word, sura , used, in later Sanskrit, in the sense of 'god', is artificially formed by regarding the a in asura as a negative termination. 3 cf. andra (Vid. X. yšt XIX. 4d ). How this Indian god came to be introduced in the Avesta has already been explained above. * cf. in-tar and in-da-ra or inaras on the Boghazk'öi tablet.

From among other attempts, in this connection, a mention may be made óf that" óf Jacobi.

According to Bezzen berger* the words, Vedic indra, av. andra, peh. andar, ags. tnt, are philo- logically cognate words and must have originally denoted some thing like a ' giant '. This view of Bezzenbbrger's seems to have been found acceptable by Hillebrandt.* Kretschmer and Benve- NtSTE suggest that the Hittite word, i it nar, denoting ' might, ' is at the basis of the word, mira. Accepting this suggestion, Batakrishna Ghosh says5 that the name of the Vedic god, Indra, is but a thema- tized form of the Hittite word, innar. There is no doubt that the words, indra and innar, are closely related to each other from the "philological point of view. But to assume on that account, as Kretschmer has done, that the concept of the Vedic god, Indra, is "Of Hittite origin is demonstrably wrong6. It should, however, be 1 YSska gives ( Nir.

One of the four gods invoked as witnesses to the treaty between the Xing of the Hittites and the Xing of Mitanni, dooumented on the Boghazktii tablet, is Inaras. What oan be the relation between this god and the Vedio Indra? It has been suggested by scholars like JACOBI ( 4 On the Antiquity of Vedic Culture*. J RAS 1909, 721-26 ) and WINTERNITZ ( Hist, of Ind. Lit. I, 306 ) that, in view of the close resemblance of the four gods mentioned on the Boghazküi tablet with the Vedio gods, Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nâsatyau, the Mitannians may be justifiably regarded as an offshoot from among the Vedic Indians migrating to South-West Asia. Acoording to these scholars, therefore, Inaras is just the Mitannian form of the Vedio Indra. Suoh an assump- tion would, however, give rise to certain difficulties from the linguistics and. culture-historical points of view ( vide Dandekar. 4 Antecedents etc*. PI HC X, 24-55 ). A more satisfactory hypothesis in ti» is connection may be proposed as follows : The Mitannians, like the Xassites, originally belonged to those ÌE tribes who migrated from their primary Urheimat in the Ural- Altaic region to Baotria. In view of their later history, these tribes mąy be ( continued on the following page )</page><page sequence="43">Vftrabâ Ināra 4 { noted that the etymological attempts mentioned above, namely, those of Jacobi, Bezzenberger, Kretschmer, and Benveniste, though not quite acceptable, rightly emphasize the fact that the name, Indra, is essentially suggestive oi ' manliness ' and ' might '. By far the most convincing etymology of the word, so far put forth, „appears to ¡be the one given by Guntert.1 Guntert derives the word, in dra, from the idg. *oid { = to swell ) and gives quite a plausible explanation of n and r found in that word.1 The name, Indra» thus emphasizes the ' swelling, manly virility ' of the hero. That: the words, indra and indu, are closely related to each other from ( continued from the previous page ) called the proto-Aryans. While living together in that region the proto- Aryans, that is to say, the ancestors of, among others, the Mitannians, the Kassites, and the Aryan« ( = the Indo-Iranians, or the ancestors of the ancient Iranians and the Vedic Indians ), must have developed their own peouliar language and religion. In the earlier part of the proto-Aryan period, the Kassites and the Mitannians seem to have further migrated from their proto-Aryan Urheimat in Bactria to SW Asia leaving their Aryan brethren behind. They must have naturally taken with them the language, and religion which thé proto-Aryans had already evolved. These language and religion must be regarded as the forerunners also of the Aryan language and religion - and so of the languages and religions represented in the Avesta and the Veda. This would account for the similarity between the Boghazkoi gods and the Vedic gods. It has been shown above that Indra was a god of specifically Vedic Indian origin. The question would, therefore, naturally arise : How then could god Inaras occur in the Mitannian religion? This can be explained in the following manner. The Mitannian word, Inaras, and the Vedic word, lndrat which are, without doubt, Unguis« tioally connected with each other, must be traced back to a common proto- Aryan word, which must have meant • a hero with swelling manly power*, As indicated above, the Mitannians migrated from the proto-Aryan Urheimat in Bactria before the Aryans did. On their way to and in 8W Asia, it is likely that they had to encounter some opposition which they ultimately overoame under the behest of one of their heroic leaders. In course of time, the Mitannians seem to have given their leader the appro- pfiate name, Inaras. Inaras was later on deified and thus secured a place in the pantheon of the Mitannian gods. The originals of thé mytho* logical conoepts of Inaras and Indra - namely, the heroio leaders of the Mitannians and the Vedio Indians respectively - were quite distinct from C&amp;oh other. It would, therefore, not be quite accurate to regard Inaras al the Mitannian counterpart of the Vedic Indřa* 1 Der arische Weltktintg und Heiland, 192B» pp. 13-14.

It must, however, be pointed out that, in that case, the word, tndu, does not denote ' drop ' of Soma or rain- water, as suggested by earlier scholars, but of the semen virile The words, vr$ä, vffabha, which are very often used in connec- tion with the Vedic Indra, would thus be semasiologically very close to the name, Indra. The Vedic god, Indra, must, therefore, have originally been a human hero, who, possessing great virile power, led his Aryan followers from victory to victory in the numerous battles in which the latter must have been engaged by their many foes. Indeed no better and more appropriate name could have been thought of for the war-like leader of the Vedic Indians. Originally a historical hero from among the Vedic Aryans, who wąs, in course of time, transformed by the Vedic poets first into an ' institutionalised ' national hero and then into the national war- god of the Vedic Indians, and who, in consonance with the war- like way of life and thought of the Vedic Indians, came to be finally regarded as the supreme god of the Vedic pantheon - this is the evolution of Indra's personality which we have traced so far.2 1 With this etymology, the interesting vrąafcapi-sUkta ( X. 86 ) would seem to aoquire a peculiar significance. 8 In his book, The Hero ( A Study in Tradition, Myth, and Drama ), London, 1949, Lord Raglan has made some thought-provoking observations on the subject of 1 Hero in mythology and history ' Without attempting a detailed examination of Raglan's observations, it may be pointed out that those observations, though very suggestive, appear to be dearly onesided. According to Raglan, there is no justification for believing that mytho- logical heroes were originally historical persons or that any of the stories of their exploits had any historical foundation. He says that the world of tradition is quite a different one from that of history. He further points out that the stories cf heroes in several mythologies in the world follow a specifio pattern, which is characterised by 22 points ( pp. 178-79 ), and that this pattern strongly suggests a ritual pattern rather than a historically authentic account. Out of these 22 points at the most four points can be found in the story of the Vedio Indra. Therefore, even accepting RAGLAN'S analysis of the 4 Hero ł ( which is by no means either complete or entirely convincing ), the Vedic Indra cannot be regarded merely as a traditional hero without any historical oharacter. It may be pointed out, in this connec- tion, that it is certainly not olaimed that the entire Ińdra-mythology U authentic history ; all that it olaimed is that there unmistakably exist, in ( continued on the following page )</page><page sequence="45">Vftrahâ Indra 45 But the 'growth1 or the 'becoming' of the Vedic Indra did not stop here. There were some other currents which were, in course of time, merged into the mythology relating to that god. One of the most natural consequences of the elevation of a human heró to the position of a god - particularly to the position of the supreme god of the pan'* theon, as in the case of Indra- was to make him responsible for some mighty cosmic deeds, As a mitter of fact, it is the association with such cosmic deeds that truly testifies to the godhead of a god. This is indeed one of the ways in which history is transformed into mythology. The further evolution of Indra's personality also is, as will be seen, the result of this process of mythological development. Indra, who was primarily and essentially the national war-god ot the Vedic Indians, accordingly came to be connected with some cosmic phenomena. In this matter, the Vedic poets seem to have proceeded more or less on strictly logical lines. A vanquisher of human ( continued from the previous page ) that mythology, some historical elements. Even Raglan seems to admit ( pp. 148, 151 ) that mythology does tend to reflect, to a oertain extent, political and economic conditions. Speaking of the basis of history, RAGLAN enumerates five classes of historical materials. Among these he inoludes contemporary records. As suggested elsewhere in this paper, it may be claimed that the Veda is, ina sense, a record of contemporary historical events. To the question posed by Raglan, with a view to ascertaining the historicity of a hero, namely : do we have any contemporary reoord of the hero's existence?, the answer, so far as Indra is conoerned, is in the affirmative. Further, it is a common experience, particularly in India, that a historically authentio hero has, in course of time, several mythical elements superimposed upon his charaoter, even when that hero has nothing to do with ritual. Several instances can be quoted, which would falsify the author's statement that no progressive monarch has been deified ( p. 204 ). It is also unwarranted to say that all myths are narratives oonneoted with ritual ( p. 144 ). To prove that no figure in mythology can have a historical charaoter, Raglan suggests ( p. 6 ) that the savage has no interest in the past and that, even if he had, there was no means of having that interest gratified. But ancient literature contains unmistakable indications that the ancient peôple did have an absorbing interest in tribar history and that they manifested it in the form of tribal songs. Raglan's observations about 'Hero' cannot, therefore, be said to affect the original historioity of Indra's personality. All that one oan say is that there did exist what may be called a universal hero-myth, which was oonneoteďwith á ritual, and that, as will be shown later, some elements of this universal hero*- myth came to be superimposed upon the Indra^mythology in the oourse of its evolutkft,</page><page sequence="46">ą6 Annals oj the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute foes could as well be regarded as a vanquisher of cosmic foes. The Vedic poets had, therefore* to think of some. cosmic wars,. /which would correspond with the fierce battles which the heroic Indra had actually fought for his Vedic Aryan followers. And the pheno- menon of nature, which exhibited many features of actual warfare, suchas, the fierceness and horror, the wrath and tumult, the ruthless uprooting of the cne and the animated elation of the other, was certainly that of thunderstorm, lightning, and rain. The Vedic poets, therefore, made Indra the central figure - the hero - of this cosmic drama.1 It is, however, not unlikely that the Vedic poets themselves were conscious of the various discrepancies - mythological and poetical - which would result from such more or less artificial development of Indra's personality.8 But such discrepancies, they must have argued, were inevitable in the normal process of mythological development. * In the process of transform- ing the heroic Indra into a rain-god, the Vedic poets must have 1 Apart from the fact that the phenomenon of thunderstorm represents the closest oosmic counterpart of an actual battle, there may have been some other reasons as well, which prevailed upon the Vedio poets while transforming the warlike Indra into a rain-god. Victory in battles, under the leadership of Indra, often opened up, for the Vedio Indians, new avenues of a richer and fuller life. Perhaps the most common blessing, which the Vedio Indians longed for in this new phase of their cultural life - which, incidentally, must have become less warlike and more settled in character - was properly-timed and plentiful rain. Such rain, again, was perhaps the only concrete bounty, which the Vedic poets could think of as resulting from the cosmic battles. The evolution of a war-god particularly into a rain- god would become fairly understandable if looked at from this point, of view. Moreover the most concrete cosmic form of vrtra or resistance, which irrtrahā Indra overcame, is the cloud, for, it is the cloud, which resists the free flow of the much loDged-for rains. Tt is also likely that, in the new conditions of life of the Vedio people, the philological connection between the words, indra and indu, was perhaps given a significance different, from the original one, and Indra then oame to be associated with rain-drops. Another factor, which must have made the Vedic poets think of the phenomenon of waters, While superimposing a cosmio obaracteť on Indra's personality, Was the merger into the Indra-mythology, at this stage, of yet another mythical current, namely, the one connected with the universal toy th of the hero and the dragon. 7 Attention has already been drawn to some of these discrepancies while critically examining the rain-god-theory about the Indra-mythology, * In the present case, it is indeed these discrepancies whioh have served as the starting point for a critical analysis of the Indra-mythology.</page><page sequence="47">Vrifaha Ināra 47 «xperienced one great difficulty. The Vedic pantheon already contained one rain-god, namely, Trita Äptya, whom the Vedle Indians had inherited from their Aryan ancestors. The question must háve, thérefore, arisen as to how to accommodate these two mythical concepts - the one of the ancient rain-god, Trita Apťýá, and the other of the new rain-god, Indra. The answer to this question, however, was quite simple, Indra, who had already become the foremost among the gods of the Vedic Indians, when transformed into a rain-god, must naturally supersede the original Aryan rain-god. As indicated in the earlier part of this paper, the Vedic poets seem to have made purposeful efforts in this direction. •Though a stray passage in the ĶV suggests that Indra took over the rôle of the rain-god from Trita (I. 52.5 ), it becomes clear that the Vedic poets have consciously attempted to obliterate the latter from memory. It is only by assuming the superimposition on Indra - at a later stage in the evolution of his personality, and for the reasons detailed above - of the character of a rain-god that the relations between Trita Aptya and Indra, as presented in the ķ V directly or indirectly, can become adequately understandable.' Side by side with this superimposition on Indra's personality of the character of a rain-god* which represents the last phase in the * As pointed out by OLDENBERG ( Rei. d. Veda , 143 )t Indra is the rain- god also in Pali literature. This is quite understandable. The superimposi- tion of the oharaoter of a rain-god on Indra's original personality represents the last phase in the growth of Indra. It is, therefore, natural that this last phase should have been mainly adopted in later literature. It may, however, be mentioned in this oonneotion that in Pali the word, vrtra% seems to have disappeared altogether ( Hille Brandt. V M III, 195 ). For, he is not men« tioned as the rival of Sakka, who has been transformed into devUnarh indo . As regards Sakka, Professor and Mrs. Rhys Davids held the view that Sakka and Indra are quite different conceptions. Charles Godage ( Ceylon Univ. Rev . Ill ), however, believes that the Buddhist conception of Sakka is a historical growth out of the epithet, Sakra, whioh is exclusively attributed to the Vedio Indra. Buddhist Sakka isa development of the Vedio Indra with the pronounced emphasis on the moral side of his nature* According to GODAGE, we can understand how the savage infuriated Vptfa-sjeyer .of .Veda came to be the exponent of ethics of mildness and nen-violenoe? and . ą jnaster in the art of self-command.</page><page sequence="48">Annais of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute process of the ' becoming ' of Indra, 1 there occurred the merger of another mythological current into the Indra-mythology. A com- parative study ol the ancient mythologies of the world would show that most of them have one myth in common, namely, the myth relating to the contest between the hero and the dragon.3 The significance of this universal myth is quite obvious. It should, however, be remembered in this connection that only the general basic skeleton of this myth is adopted by the various ancient mytho- logies, the details put into it being different in different cases. In other words, we find the concepts of ' Hero ' and 'Dragon' in almost all ancient mythologies, but these concepts do not necessarily have the same contents everywhere.8 The ancient Aryans also adapted - of course in their own peculiar manner-this myth of the hero and the dragon in the general scheme of their mythological thought. Indeed the Vedic Aryans must have found the adaptation of this myth particularly easy. In their new mythology, they had already deified the historical hero, Indra. The most natural thing for them to do, therefore, was to identify the hero of the ancient 1 The naturalistio elements in Indra's personality are» as Indioated above, derived mainly from the phenomenon of thunder-storm and rain. The growth of a war-god into a rain-god must indeed be considered to have been the result of the specific attempts made by the Vedio poets to superimpose a cosmic oharaoter on the heroio Indra. Apart from this, however, in the normal development of Vedio mythology as a whole, there was a stage, whioh was characterised by what may be called the 4 solarisation ' of several Vedio gods ( cf. Dandekar. 4 Visņu in the Veda*. Kane Comm. Vol., 95-111; *Pïïsan, the Pastoral God of the Veda'. NIA V, 49-66). Certain naturalistio elements in Indra's personality, whioh are vaguely reminiscent of the sun- god ( not, of course, in the sense in which HILLEBRANDT understands it, namely, the sun-god, who vanquishes the winter-demon, but rather in the sense in which Max MÜLLER understands it, namely, the sun-god, who daily overcomes the demon of darkness ) must have been due to this solaris» ing tendency. 2 The various forms which this universal hero-dragon-myth has taken in different ancient mythologies are : Zeus and Typhon, Heroules and the Hydra, Apollo and Python, Thor and the Serpent, Marduk and Tiamat, Gilgames and Humbaba, Innara and the Dragon, Thrœtaona and Azi DahSka. See also : RAGLAN, The Hero , London 1949, pp. 177-189. 3 Even when this myth is interpreted from the naturalistic point of view, the phenomenon of nature, which it is made to represent, is not always the same. However, as was quite natural, the dragon was normally associated with waters.</page><page sequence="49">Vflrahū Indra 49 dragon-myth with that, historical hero. Indra's principal enemies, both human and cosmic, accordingly came to be known by the name, Ahi ( dragon ), and several new elements, derived front the ancient dragon-myth, came to be introduced into the Indra-mytho. logy1. So far as the ĶV is concerned, with the identification of Indra with the hero of the ancient dragon-myth, the growth of the personality of Indra may be said to have come to an end. Before closing the history of the evolution of the personality and character of the Vedic Indra, a reference may usefully be made to his associations with some other gods. It has already been pointed out that Indra is very closely associated with the Maruts- 1 indeed, so much so that Indra is called marutvän and the Máruts are referred to as indrajyefthäh. How did this association come about and what exactly is its significance ? In order to be able to answer this question, it would be necessary to trace- albeit briefly- the evolution of the Marut-mythology, In the Rgvedic mythor . 1 E. SIECKE ( Indrďs Drachenkampf , 1905 ) traces the Indra- Ahi-ro onte» t Wek" to. lun ar origins. His theory, however, appears to be quite farfetched. According to B. Ś. ÒJHA ( JBORS 28, 55-64 ), this myth, which is found In India, Babylonia, Greece, Egypt, Persia eto., reflects the historical conflict between the serpent- worshipping people, who had spread from the. medi- terranean coasts to the Indian plains, and the non-serpent- worshipping people like the Aryans. A. P. Karmarkar ( NIA 5, 184-189 ) believes that the Mohenjodaro seals indicate the prevalence of the Nfiga- cult in those hoary times and that the Indra- Vytra-fight is symbolical of the Ary^- NSga-fight. Discussing the 44 Vedic Krivi K. RÒNNOW ( AO XV 1, 161-180 ) says that the religious history of the ĘV oontains, among other, themes, the one which refers to the tension between the Deva and Asura-cùlts of ťhe immigrant Aryans and the NSga-cults of the native peoples. -This, according to that soholar, is represented through the conflict between; Indra and Vptra-Ahi. He further suggests that, later on, many Ary au . or semi- Aryan tribes joined the serpent-oult, but the tribes worshipping Indra never compromised ( vide also foot-not.es 58, 69 and 76 ), These and similar otřber views are not improbable, but they would require more confirmatory evidence. In any case it seems certain that the elements of the ancient myth relating to the hero and the dragon were first superimposed on the Indra-mythology, and the resulting my thioal Indra- Ahi-oonflict may then have been consolidated through its historical counterpart in the form of the Arya-NSga-confltct. (In this context, reference may also be made to: A. Banerji-SaSTŘI. 44 The Nagas ABOR1 18, 338-50 ; K. K. GUPTA. 44 The Nāgas and the NKga Cult in Ancient Indian History M. PIHC III.

Just as the Maruts are designated as itidra - jyef(haķ - the followers of Indra, they are also called rudriya - the children of Rudra. How can these two concepts be correlated with each other ? It is neither possible nor necessary in the present context to go into the details of this entire problem. The following hypothesis may, however, be put forth as the only one, which would satisfactorily explain the various aspects of the mythology relating to the Maruts. Rudra seems originally to have been the god of death in the ķ V* and the Maruts belonged originally to the paraphernalia of that god. Etymologically the word, marut, may be derived from the root mar ( = to die ). It would seem likely that primarily the Maruts were the personifications of the souls of the dead® and secondarily the messengers of the god of death. As the messengers of death, the Maruts seem to have formed a uniform, well-disciplined, homogeneous group. It has been pointed out, in another context8, that, in the course of the development of Vedic .mythology, Rudra gradually lost his character as god of death and was soon superseded by Yama, who, incidentally, was not originally the god of death. Not only this, but, for this and several other reasons, Rudra seems to have also been soon reduced to quite a subordinate status in the official Vedic religion. This must have inevitably resulted in the breaking up of the original connection between Rudra and the Maruts - even the few references to that connection, which have been preserved in the ĶF, becoming gra- dually less understandable. The Vedic poets consequently gave to the mythological concept of the Maruts quite a new significance. In doing so, they emphasized a specific feature of their original character, namely, that they formed a uniform and well-disciplined group. The Maruts are like brothers, among whom none is the eldest or the youngest ( V. 59.6; 60.5 ). They are equal in age (I, 165.1 ) and are of one mind ( VIII. 20.1, 2t ). They also look alike with their golden mantles ( V. 55.6 ), golden helmets ( V. 54. it ), and armlets ( II. 34.2 ). They always move about in fixed formations - thrice sixty ( VIII. 85.8 ), or thrice seven (I. 133.6). These 1 DaNDEKAR.

When, therefore, the memories of the original character of the Maruts were being gradually obliterated, the Vedic poets must have naturally thought of associating them newly with their war-god, Indra. That the connection between the Maruts and Rudra represents a prior phase of the Marut-mythology is clearly indicated by the fewer and more or less vague references in the ĶV to that connection.' On the other hand, the references to the association between Indra and the Maruts are many and quite distinct. Moreover, the transference of the Maruts from Rudřa to Indra would appear more logical. That Maruts could have been transferred from a prominent god, like Indra, to Rudra, who had already been reduced to a subordinate position in the ĶF, is indeed inconceivable.* As mentioned elsewhere, the Maruts are represent- ed as increasing the strength and prowess of Indra ( III,. 35.9; VI. 17.1 1 ). They generally assisted him in the battles ( III. 47.3-4; VIII, 65.2-3; X. 113. 3 ).' Attention has already been drawn to a 1 Attention may be drawn, in this context, to the very significant observa- tions made by L. D. BARNETT ( " The Genius : A Study in Indo-European Psychology ". JBAS 1929, 731-748 ). According to that soholar, the striking fact that just the Maruts have some serpent-attributes ( whioh do not belong to any other gods in the BV ), such as ahibhanu (1. 172.1), ahimanyu (I. -64.8, 9), ahikuąma ( V. 33.5 ), would indicate that, in the Vedio religious traditio*!, there was some old oonneotion between the Maruts and the serpents. It would also seem to confirm the original connection between the Maruts aņd Rudra. ( The later connection between Rudra-Siva and the serpents is well- known ). BARNETT further points out that the Maruts of the J? F are in origin a host of genii, whose primary duty is the guardianship of the Aryan and his family. The ordinary man, the ranker in the Aryan armies, saw in the Maruts the celestial counterpart of himself. ( Babnett emphasizes the parallelism between the Maruts and the Fravašis of the Avesta). In his Der arische Mannerbund ( Lund 1938 ), Stig WIKANDER has expressed some interesting views on this subjeot. WlKANDER tries to prove that the Vedic word, marya , signified not merely a lusty young man but a member of a particular sooiety vowed to a particular cult. The maryas were indeed the earthly counterparts of the Maruts in heaven. According to that scholar, the two words, marya and marut , are etymologically oonnected with eaph other. * That the Maruts could have been associated with Rudra and Indra simultaneously is equally inconceivable. S The Maruts are sometimes described also as the singers of the batti?** songs ( 1. 19.4 ).</page><page sequence="52">52 Annals of lbe Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute couple of passages in the # F, which seem to show that so#« features of the mythological connection between Indra and the Maruts may have been the reflections of the actual historical con- nections between a war-lord and his lieutenants. In 1.165.6 and VIII. 7.3 1, the Maruts are described as having left their leader, Indira, in the lurch. Elsewhere ( I. 170.2; 171.6 ) there is a clear reference to the serious differences between Indra and the Maruts. It should, however, be remembered that such incidents must have been but rare, and that they perhaps only help to confirm the his- toricity of Indra's original personality. When in the course of the development of the Vedic mytho- logy» a cosmic character came to be superimposed upon the per- sonality of the national war-god, Indra, and when Indra was consequently transformed into a rain-god, a corresponding trans- formation occurred in the character of the Maruts also. The trusted lieutenants of the war-lord now became the allies of the rain-god. In other words, the Maruts came to be regarded, as the divinities connected with storm. This is the final phase . in the evolution of the character of the Maruts as presented in the RV, and that is why, in later mythology, the Maruts are usually represented as storm-gods.' Another god, with whom Indra is associated in the RV, is Brhaspati -Bra h maņaspati (II. 23.18; 24.2; IV. 49. 1-6 ; VIII. 85.15. ), A critical study of the Rgvedic hymns, which celebrate Brah maņaspati would clearly show that that god is obviously a conscious priestly creation. Without going into the details of this question, it may be pointed out that, through this god, the priestly community must have originally thought of glorifying the magic power of prayer. The word, brahman ( in Brahmaņaspati ), must be understood in the sense of the ' magic power of prayer '. As indicated 1 It is interesting to note that the Vedio god, VSyu, is rarely oonnected With the Maruts, He is only once referred to as having created the Maruts from the wombs of the heaven ( 1. 134,4 ). Had the naturalistic oharaoter of the Maruts been primary, there would have occurred more frequent references to the association between Vayu-Vsta and the Maruts. See, in this connec- tion : Stig WlKANDEB. Vayu. Uppsala 1941. WIK ANDER says that, in the rites, myths, and speculations relating to V5yu-V8ta, we have olear traoes of an old religion whioh must have played an important rôle in the cómmon Indo-Iranian period. Aocording to him, Väyu-Väta was not jnerejy a god of Wind but also of ' breathing ' - the soul of the universe.</page><page sequence="53">Vftrahā Indra 53 above, on account of their warlike way of life and thought, the Vedic Aryans transformed Indra, their victorious warrior-leader, into th# supreme god of the Vedic pantheon. At that time, it mīļst have been the anxiety of the Vedic poets and priests - an anxiety which is indeed quite understandable - to impress generally upon the people that it was not merely the valour of the warriors, blessed by the national war-god, Indra, which helped them towards victory. In order to be truly effective that valour has to be necessarily aided by the magic power of prayer. This anxiety, on the part of the Vedic poets and priests, may be said to have been mythõlogicálly expressed through the creation of Brahmaņaspati. In this context, attention may be drawn to the very significant fact that Brahma- ņaspati, like Indra, is a god of specifically Indian origin. The Vedic poets have consciously set this god by the side of Indra and have represented him as having been responsible- together with Indra - for the victorious battles against the enemies ( II. 23.18*; IV. 49. 1-6 ). Sometimes this anxiety to place the magic power of prayer on par with warlike valour seems to have got the better of the Vedic poets. As the result of this, in some passages, Brahma- ņaspati alone is credited, by the Vedic poets, with having ac- complished the heroic deeds which are normally - and, of course., more naturally - attributed to Indra ( I. 40.8 ; II. 23.11; 24.2; VI. 73. 1-2 ; X. 67.5 ; 103.4). Some of Indra's exclusive epithets also have been applied to Brahmaņaspati - such as, for instance, maghavati (II. 24.12) and vojrin (1.40.8)'. The obvious in- congruity between the basic character of Brahmaņaspati, as clearly indicated by his name, and the generally warlike traits, which are sometimes attributed to him, can thus be rationally accounted for.5 . The history of the evolution of Indra's personality, which has been set forth above, would now make it amply clear why the 1 It is likely that a peouliar reaotion of this tendency is to be seen in the passages where Indra is referred to - rather incongruously - as krta * brahma (V 1.20,3), brahman ( VI. 45.7 ), and brahviavāhas ( VI. 45,4 ). 3 As was to be expected, in oourse of time, Indra, the national war-god of the Vedic pantheon, came to be regarded as the prototype and the guardian of kingship in anoient India ( A V XIX. 24.2 ; MS II, 1.4 ; AB VII, 23,1 ; 6 PB III. 9.1.16, 18 ), The bhûmi is said to have chosen Indra as her lord ( AV XII. 1.37 ). In AY ( III. 4.6 ), the king is significantly referred to as human Indra. Corresponding to this development of the Indra-conoept, Brahmaņaspati must have oome to be regarded at the symbol of sacerdote lism ( TB I. 7,7.4 ),</page><page sequence="54">54 Annals oj the Bhandarkar Oriental Research institute Vedic mythology, as a whole, is so very greatly dominated by that god. As indicated elsewhere, in course of time, Indra came to be regarded as the very symbol of the official Vedic religion. This fact is fully confirmed by a peculiar mythological device, which is sometimes employed in the R V. Side by side with what may be called the official or hierarchical Vedic religion, there had existed, in the Vedic age, several other currents of mythical and religious thought. These latter seem to have been current either among the masses of tire Vedic people (as against the hierarchical classes ) or among the non-Vedic people. It may be presumed that the reli- gious and mythological ideology of these people was, for several reasons, found to be more or less unacceptable by the guardians of the official Vedic religion, which gradually tended to become sophisticated and hierarchical. Their gods, therefore, must have originally received but scant recognition at the hands of the Vedic poets and priests. In course of time, however, the religious thought of the masses - both Vedic and non-Vedic - must have effectively asserted itself. Consequently their gods must have in- evitably forced their way into the Vedic pantheon. With a view to properly consolidating this new position acquired by the ' popular' gods, the Vedic poets, who sponsored them, brought them into close association with Indra - more often artificially than otherwise. Such association with Indra, the symbol of the official Vedic religion, served the purpose of setting the seal, as iuwere, of official recognition for those gods.' The association of Indra with Visņu and with Püsan, which is demonstrably artificial and the result of an afterthought, belongs to this category.2 The popular gods, Visņu and Püsan, were, so to say, granted official recogni- tion by associating them with Indra. Except on this assumption, 1 Another device of a similar character intended for officially introduc- ing a god into the Vedic ritual sôems to have been to associate that god with Soma« 1 vide DANDBKA.R, "Visņu in the Veda".

( vide D ANDE K AB on Vi§ņu and Pus an ). 1 According to SHENDE ( XIII AIOC, Summary, 1946 ), Rgvedic Indra is transformed in the Atharvaveda into a deity of popular appeal to redress private and publio grievanoes. See, in this oonneotion, also Renou. " Indra dans l' Atharvaveda NIA VIII, 123-129. GaJENDRAGADKAR ( XIII AIOC, Summary , 1946 ) points to the striking difference between the Indra of the Veda and the Indra of the epios. While the Vedio Indra, insplte of a not entirely moral conduct, ever remains pre-eminent, the epio Indra is haunted by the shadow of defeat and dethronement. 1 Harivaniêa, adhyãyas 15-18. 4 The sequel of that episode seems to hint at the victory of the popular religion over the Vedio religion. It is interesting to note, in this oonneotion, that, in a late Kûvya by a South Indian poet ( 17th cent. A. D. ), Kpçqa is aotually given the title of the 4 queller of the pride of Indra ' ( vide O . C, Gangoly. " Indra-Cult versus Krsņa-Cult JGJR1 VII, 1-27). When ultimately Kpsņa came to be regarded as the ohief god of the I&amp;ndu pantheon, some epithets of Indra, such às yovinda and kehini&amp;dana, seem to have been transferred to him.</page></plain_text>
