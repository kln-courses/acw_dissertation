Box 6000 Binghamton, NY 13902 jkennedl ?binghamton. edu Research on Ubaid ceramics has traditionally focused on categorizing and describ ing ceramic types or building chronologies. Only in a few cases have researchers sought a broader understanding of Ubaid assemblages by focusing on the quantifica tion, rather than the qualification, of Ubaid ceramic data. In this study, we analyze the entirety of the Ubaid ceramic assemblage from reliable contexts at the site of Kenan Tepe in southeastern Turkey?a total of 14,333 ceramic sherds. In sorting the ceramics by fabric, form, surface treatment, rim type, and vessel size, this study pro vides statistically significant empirical data pertaining to three avenues of analysis. First, we focus on the characteristics of the overall assemblage of Ubaid ceramics from Kenan Tepe. Second, we analyze the data diachronically to highlight stability and change through the four phases of Ubaid occupation at Kenan Tepe. And third, we investigate the spatial distribution of part of the assemblage in and around a large Ubaid-period domestic structure. We contend that quantitative studies of entire excavated ceramic assemblages allow researchers a more complete understanding of ceramic assemblages, provide a firmer foundation for theorizing vessel function, and offer the tools to make empirically based assessments of ancient lifeways. INTRODUCTION raditionally, scholars have viewed the Ubaid period as the developmental bridge between A V. Gordon Childe's "Neolithic" and "Urban" revolutions (Childe 1951; Henrickson and Thuesen 1989). To this end, early research focused on the architectural remains at large sites such as Eridu, Ur, and Warka that would inform scholars about the roots of urbanism in southern Mesopotamia (Safar, Mus tafa, and Lloyd 1981; Woolley 1955; Noldeke 1932). Following this emphasis on urban origins, studies of Ubaid ceramics were explicitly focused on building chronologies that would link Ubaid material culture to later urban and colonial phases of Near Eastern history (Akkermans 1988c; Finkbeiner 2001; Oates 1960; 1983; Rothman 2002; Surenhagen 1986). More recent ceramic studies have concentrated on the creation of regional chronologies and typologies (Gut 1995; 2002; Rothman 2001; Rova 1999-2000; Trufelli 1997). Thus far, only a few researchers (e.g., Akkermans 1988a; Schwartz 1988; Thuesen 1989) have sought a broader understanding of Ubaid as semblages by focusing on the quantification of Ubaid ceramic data. However, in both the case of Hammam et-Turkman (Akkermans 1988a) and of Tell Leilan (Schwartz 1988), the wider application of quantita tive ceramic analyses has been hindered by small sample sizes, limited spatial exposure, and an exclu sion of nondiagnostic ceramics. The goal of this paper is to provide a quantitative attribute analysis of the complete Ubaid ceramic corpus originating from large horizontal exposures at the site of Kenan Tepe in the Upper Tigris River region of southeastern Turkey 1</page><page sequence="2">2 PARKER AND KENNEDY BASOR 358 BULGARIA ^ ~ . ^\ ^ H Black Sea \ GEORGIA ^^^^^ ^ARMENIA ' *y ^ANKARA _/ ^S^^^^ Lake Van VzER. * ItVan I ^ yJ^* Diyarbakir ysy**^"v*"~"^r/\ ^ ^ Mediterranean Sea ^"y? 0 75 150 km I-1?i-1-. 0 75 150 mi Fig. 1.

Excavations carried out at Kenan Tepe under the auspices of the Upper Tigris Archaeological Research Project (UTARP) have revealed that the stratigraphic sequence of Kenan Tepe's Ubaid-period occupation consists of four phases (abbreviated KTU Phases 1 through 4 [table 1]). KTU Phase 1 strata can be bro ken down into three subphases (KTU Phase la, lb, and lc). The only remains thus far excavated belong ing to KTU Phase la were encountered in a 1 x 1 m sounding in the southeastern corner of Trench D5 (fig. 2; also see Parker et al. 2008: 105).2 Remains dating to KTU Phase lb are characterized by a num 1 The quantification of the Ubaid ceramics from Kenan Tepe took place between June 1 and July 3, 2008.

Thus far, no definitive evidence for domestic architecture has been recovered in this subphase. KTU Phase lc is characterized by a small architectural unit consisting of walls protruding into Trench D8 from its north eastern corner to encompass an area of approxi mately 1.5 x 1.5 m (referred to as "Ubaid Structure 5" in Parker et al. 2009). The remainder of this struc ture is likely contained in the eastern and northern baulks and may have originally stretched into the neighboring Trench D5. This small structure was associated with an outdoor work surface that yielded a number of domestic artifacts, including ground stone tools, ceramics, and lithics. Remains dating to KTU Phases 2 and 3 have been excavated in five trenches in Area D (Trenches D4, D5, D6, D8, and D10 [fig. 2; for discussion, see Parker et al. 2008; 2009]). KTU Phase 2/3 strata are characterized by a large house (excavated as Ubaid Structure 4) and its associated outdoor work areas and storage structures (excavated as Ubaid Struc tures 1 and 2). The central room of the house mea sured approximately 7 x 3 m and was oriented roughly north-south. This room was flanked on the east and north by several smaller rooms and storage</page><page sequence="3">2010 CERAMIC CORPUS FROM KENAN TEPE Table 1.

The rooms adjoining the western wall of the main room remain unexcavated. A large (ca. 5 x 4 m) outdoor work area was located south of the house. This surface was buttressed by a stone retain ing wall on its western (downslope) side and con tained two hearths. To the east and slightly downslope from the domestic structure were several adjoining rooms and a number of small cubicle or cell rooms (fig. 3). The data suggest that these cell rooms served as storage chambers similar to those noted at Abada (Jasim 1989) and Kosak Shamali (Nishiaki and Matsutani 2001 [Parker et al. 2009]). Two phases of the construction of these cell rooms took place dur ing the use life of the house. The first phase (KTU Phase 2) consisted of three sets of walls joining at right angles to form at least five cell rooms and two larger, possible habitation rooms. In KTU Phase 3, these cell rooms were reconstructed and another similar set of cell rooms was built in the southern portion of the trench (fig. 3). An outdoor surface measuring approximately 2 x 3 m separated these two sets of cell rooms. The domestic structure and the rooms adjoining the second phase of presumed storage chambers were destroyed in a catastrophic fire that brought debris from the roof, the roof itself, and the upper portions of the wall crashing down into the central room and onto an outdoor work area northeast of the house (Parker et al. 2009). Kenan Tepe's final phase of Ubaid occupation (KTU Phase 4) is attested in a much smaller area than the previ ous three phases. KTU Phase 4 remains, including two hearths, parts of several walls, and three infant burials, were excavated in Trench D6. Although these remains were relatively ephemeral, sealed work sur faces and hearth constructions yielded large ceramic samples.3 METHODOLOGY In order to quantify significant characteristics of the Ubaid ceramic corpus, we began by dividing the ceramics into fabric types. We divided the fabrics into three broad groups: fine, medium, and coarse. Fine-ware fabrics are well levigated and contain fine to very fine grit temper. Sherds are often well fired and exhibit an even color throughout. Medium fab rics contain medium grit and some chaff temper. Ceramics made of this fabric are often incompletely fired, exhibiting a black core, and are occasionally chaff faced. Coarse fabrics are characterized by large chaff and grit temper. Sherds often contain large grit inclusions and grade to black at the core. Cooking 3 More in-depth descriptions of these contexts can be found in Parker et al. 2008 and 2009.</page><page sequence="5">2010 CERAMIC CORPUS FROM KENAN TEPE 5 vessels, which have less (or no) chaff and often have sand temper, were recorded as such but were included in the coarse fabric count and weight calculations. Although our previous analysis has shown that we could certainly further subdivide the Ubaid fabrics (Parker and Dodd 2005: 72), our goal was to create easily discernible categories that would both facili tate our analysis and allow multiple teams of ceramic processors to move through large numbers of sherds relatively quickly.4 More importantly, however, these broad categories are likely to be less site-specific and thus should aid researchers in intersite comparison. Nearly all of the ceramics from secure Ubaid period loci were recorded in this study. After weigh ing and counting sherds of each fabric group, we separated body sherds from rim sherds. Body sherds were further quantified by recording the surface treatment,5 the presence/absence and type of decora tion on painted sherds,6 the vessel size category,7 the presence/absence of sooting, and the thickness of each sherd (at its thickest extant point). In this study, we define surface treatment using a practice-based, operational chain approach, meaning that each sur face treatment is viewed as an individual step taken in the production of the vessel. For example, the difference between the paint on sherds in the un treated fabric category and the paint on those in the slip category is that the maker of a paint-on-slip vessel would have to have completed two distinct operational steps (the application of the slip and the decoration of the vessel with paint), whereas the paint on-untreated-fabric vessel would have required only the application of paint. This contrasts with our Dec orative Motifs attribute category, which describes the designs applied to the surface of the vessel, pri marily with paint, but also (rarely) with patterned burnishing, incision, or impression. A similar, although more detailed, procedure was followed for the rim sherds. After recording the sur 4 We created what Orton, Tyers, and Vince (1993: 72) call "coherent fabric groups." 5 The categories of surface treatments utilized in this study are: unfinished, smoothed, burnished, slipped, paint on untreated fabric, paint on slipped fabric, incised, and impressed. 6 The decorative motifs recorded in this study are listed in table 2. 7 These are: small, medium, large, and extra-large. We define small vessels as less than 15 cm in diameter, medium vessels as be tween 15 and 30 cm in diameter, large vessels as between 30 and 50 cm in diameter, and extra-large vessels as larger than 50 cm in diameter. face treatment and decoration (fig. 4; table 2), the presence/absence of sooting, and sherd thickness (1 cm below the rim), sherds were classified by rim shape (fig. 5; table 3). Our rim shape categories were kept relatively broad to aid in comparison and to al low comprehensive categorization of the assem blage. Special attention was paid to dividing shapes into functional categories, including open vessels (serving), closed vessels (storage), and those used for food processing and cooking. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OVERALL ASSEMBLAGE A total of 14,333 ceramic sherds are analyzed in this study.8 Of this total, 11,990 are body sherds, 2,200 are rim sherds, 123 are bases, and 20 are handles. The following analysis concentrates on the overall characteristics of the Ubaid assemblage from Kenan Tepe without regard to diachronic variation. Fabric Sherds composed of coarse fabric make up 23.33% of the assemblage (n = 3,344), those of medium fab ric 43.46% (n = 6,229), and those of fine fabric 33.16% (n = 4,753). Seven sherds are composed of an indeterminate fabric. In comparing fabric to surface treatment (table 4), a number of interesting statistics come to light. First, these data confirm our earlier supposition (Parker et al. 2006: 91-92) that Ubaid painted decorations are most common on vessels composed of fine fabric. They also show that painted decorations are rare on vessels composed of medium fabric and virtually nonexistent on vessels of coarse fabric. Instead, medium-fabric vessels are most commonly slipped or smoothed. Coarse-fabric vessels are most commonly burnished. One ceramic type often used to distinguish the later phases of the Ubaid period is known as the "Coba" or "flint scraped" bowl. The data from Kenan Tepe show a strong correlation between sherds composed of me dium fabric and the scraping characteristic of Coba bowls. In spite of the often sloppy appearance of Coba bowls, these data suggest that their manufac ture may have followed established norms dictating 8 Note that this figure varies slightly from that discussed in Parker et al. 2009. The difference is that this study includes bases and handles, which were not part of the preliminary discussion of these data.</page><page sequence="6">6 PARKER AND KENNEDY BASOR 358 not only surface treatment, but also fabric composi tion and shape. The correlation between fabric, surface treatment, and sooting allows a number of suppositions about Kenan Tepe's Ubaid cooking vessels. To begin with, the occurrence of sooting does not support the con clusion that one-time conflagrations, such as the fire that destroyed Ubaid Structure 4 at Kenan Tepe, are responsible for sooting. If this were the case, we would expect sooting to be much more evenly dis tributed throughout the different fabrics in the cor pus. We would also expect more rim sherds to be sooted. And finally, we would expect to see sooted sherds concentrated within Ubaid Structure 4. Instead, the sooting recorded on sherds from the Kenan Tepe corpus appears to have been created through habitual contact with fire. We thus suggest that the sooting recorded on sherds from Kenan Tepe's ceramic cor pus is likely indicative of cooking (Hally 1983; Rice 1987: 235; Orton, Tyers, and Vince 1993: 222). Sooting is very common on sherds composed of coarse fabric. The data show that 31.43% (n = 1,051) of coarse fabric sherds are sooted, while only 3.92% (n = 244) of medium and 1.12% (n = 53) of fine-fab ric sherds are sooted. Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between coarse-fabric sherds that are either burnished or smoothed and sooting (table 5). Isolating the shape of sooted coarse-fabric vessels is difficult, since we would expect sooting acquired through repeated contact between filled vessels and fire or coals to affect the lower portions of vessels, and thus rim sherds should be less likely to show this type of use alteration (Rice 1987: 235). In spite of this, there is enough of a clustering of sooted rim sherds to isolate two shapes that likely belong to cooking vessels. The first is the Short Angle Rim Jar (fig. 6A-C; tables 5, 6), a round, hole-mouthed jar with an average rim diameter of 18.95 cm (standard deviation [SD] = ? 5.66 cm).9 The size and shape of these vessels suggest that they were primarily used for heating or cooking well-saturated foods such as soups, stews, or porridges. A second clustering of burnishing/smoothing and sooting can be seen in the percentage of Rounded Straight Rim Bowls (fig. 6D-G; tables 5, 6). In this case, 54.23% (n = 32) of the total number of 59 bur nished or smoothed coarse-fabric sherds are sooted. The identification of the Rounded Straight Rim Bowl 9 Of the total of 85 burnished and smoothed examples of Short Angle Rim Jars, 54.11% (n = 46) are sooted. % F III -/ 6?r M Fig. 4. Ubaid decorative motifs from Kenan Tepe. as part of the Ubaid cooking assemblage came as somewhat of a surprise, since this is an open vessel with a relatively small average rim diameter (20.11 cm [SD ?8.8 cm]). Since no lids have yet been identified in Kenan Tepe's Ubaid ceramic corpus, we suggest that these vessels were used for frying or warming foods that were not heavily saturated. Surface Treatment A total of 9,586 sherds or 66.78% of the Ubaid ceramic assemblage from Kenan Tepe exhibit some type of surface treatment (table 7). Although this figure is relatively high, it should be noted that only 16.67% (n = 2,392 [558 paint-on-untreated-fabric and 1,834 paint-on-slip]) of the sherds in the assem blage are painted.10 In spite of the fact that the finely 10 Since our surface treatment categories are practice based, we discerned two distinct categories of painting based on the steps required in their manufacture.

Furthermore, in spite of the fact that the ratios presented here cannot be seen as representative outside of the Kenan Tepe corpus, the available data suggest that roughly similar ratios exist at other Ubaid sites. For example, at Hammam et-Turkman Level IVA, the proportion of painted rim sherds in 11 One caveat to this figure should be mentioned. Some slipped sherds (which make up 19.21% of the assemblage) may represent unpainted portions of vessels whose body was only par tially painted. Although this is certainly something to consider, our interpretation is that even if this is the case, the percentage of painted to unpainted vessels in the Ubaid corpus would not be increased substantially. the ceramic assemblage is 17.6% (Akkermans 1988c: 112). At Tell al-cAbr, painting is present on nearly 90% of diagnostic sherds in Level 7 and declines to less than 20% of diagnostics in Level 2 (Hammade and Yamazaki 2006). Although 85% of the sherds kept by the excavators of Tepe Gawra Level XII are painted, Rothman's survey of whole vessels?all of which were saved?showed that only 12% were painted (Rothman 2002: 55). A total of 2,955 decorative motifs were recorded on 2,392 painted sherds from Kenan Tepe's Ubaid ceramic corpus (fig. 4; tables 2, 8). By far the most common identifiable motif is Horizontal Stripes, which accounts for 40.07% of the recorded painted decorations (n = 1,184). Other common motifs are Solid Registers, Horizontal Undulating Lines, Inte rior Rim Stripes, and Reverse Concentric Circles. The majority of painted decorations recorded in the assemblage at Kenan Tepe show strong parallels</page><page sequence="8">8 PARKER AND KENNEDY BASOR 358 7 I I A B C i r D E &lt; Z \ F G H Fig. 5. Ubaid rim forms from Kenan Tepe. to other Ubaid sites throughout greater Mesopota mia, including southern (cOueili, Ras al-Amiya), central (Tell Abada, Tell Madhhur), and northern Iraq (Tepe Gawra), Syria (Hammam et-Turkman, Tell al-cAbr, Tell Ziyadeh, Tell Kosak Shamali), and Turkey (Tell Kurdu, Degirmentepe [Parker et al. 2006: 84-94]). Although these similarities clearly place the Ubaid remains unearthed at Kenan Tepe within the orbit of the Late Ubaid ceramic tradition, the assemblage also displays some local idiosyncra sies. Kenan Tepe's most common decorative motifs (Horizontal Stripes, Solid Registers, Horizontal Un dulating Lines, and Interior Rim Stripes) appear to be ubiquitous at Ubaid sites in northern Mesopota mia (Akkermans 1988a; Gut 1995; Hammade and Yamazaki 2006; Koizumi 1993; Schwartz 1988; Tobler 1950). However, our fifth most frequent deco rative motif, Reverse Concentric Circles, is paral leled by only a few examples from Tell Kashkashok II (Koizumi 1993) in the Khabur and at nearby Yen ice Yam (Bernbeck, Costello, and Unal 2004) in the Upper Tigris River Valley. The prevalence of the Concentric Circle motif at Kenan Tepe and Yenice Yam suggests a regional variation in decorative patterns used by potters in the Upper Tigris River Valley. It should also be noted that ceramics with bichrome painted and incised decorations are ex tremely rare in the Kenan Tepe corpus (bichrome painted sherds are absent from the corpus, and in cised sherds make up 0.24% [n = 35] of the assem blage; table 7). Publications from other Ubaid sites such as Tell Abada (Jasim 1985), Tepe Gawra (To bler 1950; Rothman 2002), and Tell Madhhur (Roaf 1989) suggest that this is not always the case, al though without quantified ceramic data sets from these and other sites, it is difficult to determine if this impression is actually reflective of the ceramic as semblages from these sites. Size and Thickness A total of 11,990 body sherds were recorded in this study. Of these, 53.96% (n = 6,614) belong to "medium" vessels measuring a minimum of between 16 and 30 cm in diameter, 13.46% (n = 1,614) belong to "large" vessels with a minimum diameter of be tween 31 and 50 cm, and 12.28% (n = 1,472) belong to "small" vessels with a minimum diameter of be tween 1 and 15 cm. Vessels we consider to be "extra large" (with a minimum diameter of more than 50 cm) made up only 2.07% of the body-sherd assemblage (n = 248).12 As expected, both the average vessel thickness and the standard deviation of sherd thick ness increase with minimum vessel size.13 A number of interesting observations can be made when we compare fabric type with minimum vessel size (table 9). This comparison shows that medium size vessels composed of medium fabric make up the largest group of analyzed body sherds. The next most frequent correlation between fabric type and minimum size are medium-size fine-fabric vessels and medium-size coarse-fabric vessels. In an effort to identify size categories among the bowls in the Kenan Tepe corpus, we created a histo gram plotting the maximum vessel size to the fre quency of Simple Round Rims (fig. 7). These data show that the majority of the Simple Round Rims from Kenan Tepe belong to relatively small bowls measuring between 10 and 26 cm in diameter, al 12 A total of 18.23% (n = 2,186) of the body sherds considered here were of undetermined size. 13 Small vessels average 6.09 mm in thickness (SD = 2 mm), medium vessels average 8.87 mm in thickness (SD = 2.67 mm), large vessels average 13.54 mm in thickness (SD = 3.65 mm), and extra-large vessels average 18.91 mm in thickness (SD = 4.94 mm).</page><page sequence="9">2010 CERAMIC CORPUS FROM KENAN TEPE Table 3.

Parker et al. 2006: figs. 17H, 18A-B; Parker and Dodd 2005: fig. 6E). Round jars whose body may be globular or bag-shaped. These jars have a short-flaring rim that curves outward with a sharp angle (cf. Parker et al. 2006: 87, fig. 20C, E, G). Short, globular jars, which resemble the Angle Rim Globular Jar; however, the rims on these vessels are much shorter (cf. Parker and Dodd 2005: fig. 7D). Bowls with a sharply incurving and rounded rim (cf. Parker et al. 2006: figs. 15E, 16C, 18C, 19M, 22A). Bowls with a slightly incurving, flat, or sometimes beveled rim (cf. Parker et al. 2006: figs. 17A, 221). though the vast majority (70% [668 of 947]) are be tween 13 and 22 cm in diameter. Only a handful of the Simple Round Rim sherds (7) were over 30 cm in diameter. The data also suggest that there are four main size categories among Kenan Tepe's simple bowls. The first cluster consists of 373 rims whose diameters fall between 13 and 17 cm. A second clus ter, consisting of 275 rims, have diameters between 18 and 21 cm. A third cluster consists of 44 rims whose diameters fall between 24 and 26 cm. Finally, 15 rim sherds have diameters between 28 and 31 cm. The fact that the majority of the simple open bowls in the Kenan Tepe corpus are relatively small sug gests that among serving vessels, there is an empha sis on small, presumably individual servings. This interpretation draws an interesting contrast to the Late Chalcolithic 3-4 assemblages in northern Mes opotamia, which are characterized by large "ham merhead" bowls and casserole jars (Akkermans 1988b; Creekmore 2007; Parker and Dodd 2005; Pollock and Coursey 1995; Schwartz 2001), which have been interpreted as serving vessels for commu nal food consumption (Bernbeck, Costello, and Unal 2004; Pearce 1999). Pollock (in press) has noted that approximately two-thirds of Ubaid eating/serving vessels from Tell Madhhur and Tell Abada had rim diameters smaller than 18 cm. She suggests that the size of these vessels is representative of an emphasis on single servings which provide for, or promote, the differentiation of individuals during the consumption of the meal. Vessel Form Our primary objective in analyzing the vessel forms from the Kenan Tepe corpus was to group vessels into the following use categories: cooking, transport, serving, and storage. Cooking vessels were relatively easy to distinguish, based on a corre lation between fabric type and sooting. We further</page><page sequence="10">10 PARKER AND KENNEDY Table 4.

Closed or restricted vessel forms are those with an orifice diameter less than the maximum diameter of the vessel at its largest point (Rice 1987: 212). display, or use of other materials. We further assume that, due to their restricted orifices, closed vessels were generally used to store or transport foodstuffs, raw materials, or manufactured goods (Howard 1981). The vast majority of the rim sherds from Kenan Tepe are from open vessels (which constitute 66.55% [n = 1,464] of the assemblage). Sherds from closed vessels represent only 32.36% (n = 712) of the total assemblage (24 rim sherds were unclassified). Rim sherds were further subdivided into five open-form rim types and six closed-form rim types (fig. 5; tables 3, 10).

Several large Straight Ledge Rim Jars were discovered in close association with charred grain seeds in the Ubaid Structure 4 collapse layer. The lack of any processing debris or small weed seeds within the botanical samples led us to the conclusion that these remains represent the final stages of plant processing. This suggests that some large open vessels may have been used for the tem porary storage of grain at various stages of production. A total of 2,200 rim sherds were recorded for this study. Of these, 46.18% (n = 1,016) are composed of fine fabric, 40.95% (n = 901) of medium fabric, and 12.73% (n = 280) of coarse fabric (3 are unde termined). A total of 32.81% of the Kenan Tepe Ubaid rim sherds are painted, making paint the most common surface treatment recorded on rim sherds.15 Slipped, Smoothed, and Burnished rim sherds are 15 Paint on Slip makes up 25.58% (n = 556) of recorded rim sherds, while paint on untreated fabric constitutes 7.23% (n = 160) of recorded rim sherds. also common.16 The number of painted rim sherds is significantly higher than the number of body sherds that exhibit similar surface treatments (16.67%) at Kenan Tepe, but it is similar to figures from other Ubaid sites. Thuesen (2000) reports that about 35% of the Ubaid rim sherds from Tell Mashnaqa Phases I?III were painted. Likewise at Tell Leilan, approxi mately 38% of recorded rim sherds from Phase Via Strata 58-61 were painted (Schwartz 1988), and at Tell Kurdu roughly 45% of Amuq E rim sherds were painted (Yener et al. 2000). At Tell Hammam et Turkman, the number of painted rim sherds from Phase IVA was only 17.6%, a point that led Akker mans (1988a) to argue that Ubaid cultural norms were less influential in the Balikh region than in many other parts of greater Mesopotamia. The Kenan Tepe Ubaid assemblage is dominated by open bowls. Rounded Straight Rim bowls are the most common vessel in the Kenan Tepe assemblage, accounting for 56.41% (n = 1,241) of the total as semblage (table 10). Flat Straight Rim and Everted Beaded Rim bowls account for another 7.05% (n = 155). When we correlate approximate vessel size with rim type, it becomes apparent that open vessels are most commonly relatively small in size.17 These combined data support the theory about patterns of consumption offered in the above section. Medium size jars composed of medium fabric are the most common jar form in the Kenan Tepe corpus. The most common jar form, the Angle Rim Globular Jar, comprises 12.27% (n = 270) of the rim sherd assemblage. Our assumption is that medium-size jars (ca. &gt; 30 cm) were used for storage. However, this type of jar was clearly not meant to be completely stationary: even when full of liquid, medium jars could likely be moved by a single person. Although the practical implications of these data are open to various interpretations, we suggest that this emphasis on medium-size jars is likely indicative of an economy based on autonomous household units. We speculate that medium-size jars served the storage needs of households, since they allowed flexibility and mobil ity in an economy that emphasized the storage of mul tiple small parcels for periodic consumption. 16 Slipped sherds make up 11.70% (n = 259), Smoothed sherds 10.62% (n = 235), and Burnished sherds 10.44% (n = 231) of the rim sherds recorded. 17 It is important to note, however, that the prevalence of small open vessels could be the result of frequent breakage, and there fore small open bowls may not be as prominent in the Ubaid assemblage at any given moment as our data suggest (Mills 1989).</page><page sequence="12">12 PARKER AND KENNEDY BASOR 358 | '^^^ '^^^ v. i / 0 5 10CM Fig. 6.

(Parker and Dodd 2005: 90; Parker et al. 2008: 106), the currently available data allow us to determine neither the total length of the sequence nor the time depth between the phases within the sequence. In spite of this, the increasing prevalence of flint-scraped "Coba bowls" suggests an end date for Kenan Tepe's Ubaid sequence sometime around 4400 b.c.e. (Rothman 2001: 9). Coba bowls, first discovered at Coba Hoyiik (du Plat Taylor, Seton-Williams, and Waechter 1950), are simple, shallow open bowls with scraped lower exteriors. They first appear throughout northern Mesopotamia in the Terminal Ubaid (Late Chalco lithic 1) period (Schwartz 2001). Furthermore, given the depth of deposit between KTU Phase 1 and the carbon determinations made from KTU Phase 3 con texts, we would tentatively suggest a beginning date for this sequence sometime around 4800 b.c.e. These estimations would support a date range for the four phases of Ubaid occupation at Kenan Tepe of be tween 200 and 400 years. We therefore suggest that Kenan Tepe's Ubaid sequence likely lies somewhere between approximately 4800 and 4400 b.c.e.

We then compared the assemblages to other Ubaid sites to produce a relative chronology (table 11). Our assessment of the dating of the ceram ics from the various occupational phases in Kenan Tepe's sequence also depends on two important chronological markers. First, incurved rim bowls with round simple rims and round bases are much more prominent in earlier Ubaid assemblages across greater Mesopotamia, while incurved rim bowls with flat or outturned rims and flat bases are characteris tic of later Ubaid assemblages (Koizumi 1993). The second chronological marker is the flint-scraped Coba bowl which, as noted above, first appears throughout northern Mesopotamia in the Terminal Ubaid period (Late Chalcolithic 1). In addition to the morphology of specific vessel types, we calculated the percentage of painted rim sherds from each phase and compared that figure to the published data from Tell Hammam et-Turkman (Akkermans 1988a), Tell Leilan (Schwartz 1988), and Tell Mashnaqa (Thuesen 2000). The per centages of painted rim sherds are shown in table 12. The earliest phase of occupation, KTU Phase 1, is the most difficult to assess chronologically. The assemblage from this phase shows strong morpho logical and decorative parallels to the published ma terials from Tepe Gawra Levels XV-XIII (Tobler 1950), the Spat-'Obed phase at Nineveh (Gut 1995), and the Hammam et-Turkman Phase IVB (Akker mans 1988a). However, the most telling chronologi cal characteristic of the ceramic assemblage from this phase is the high number of incurved-rim vessels with round bases and simple rounded rims (which constitute 13.20% [n = 31] of the assemblage). This, combined with the near absence of flint-scraped bowls (which constitute only 0.13% [n = 3] of the assemblage), suggests that KTU Phase 1 dates to the Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 4 in Oates's 1960 chronology. The most direct ceramic parallels to KTU Phase 2 lie at the nearby site of Yenice Yam. KTU Phase 2 ceramics are nearly indistinguishable from the cer amics uncovered from the earliest excavated levels there (Yenice Yam Phase 5 [Bernbeck and Costello in press; Kennedy 2008]). KTU Phase 2 ceramics also show strong parallels to Phase IVC at Tell Ham mam et-Turkman (Akkermans 1988a), Tell Leilan Phase VIb (Schwartz 1988), Tepe Gawra Level XIII (Tobler 1950), and Level 4 at Tell al-cAbr (Hammade and Yamazaki 2006). Incurved-rim vessels with round bases and round simple rims are less common in the KTU Phase 2 assemblage (they represent 8.20% [n = 16] of the assemblage), while at the same time, incurved-rim vessels with flat rims become more prevalent (accounting for 3.55% [n = 7]). Flint scraped Coba bowls remain relatively rare, with a total of 10 scraped sherds (0.81%) recovered from KTU Phase 2 contexts. This analysis, when com bined with the ceramic parallels, points to an Ubaid 4 (Oates 1960) date of KTU Phase 2. The majority of the ceramics from KTU Phase 3 were recovered from Ubaid Structure 4. The differ ence in excavated contexts resulted in some interest ing statistical anomalies. From a chronological point of view, the most important is the decreased preva lence of both varieties of incurved-rim bowls.18 The total number of scraped sherds in the assemblage rises to 1.93% (n = 68) during KTU Phase 3.19 These data suggest a date in the later part of Ubaid 4 for the KTU Phase 3 contexts. This assessment is supported by the radiocarbon dates from these contexts (fig. 8; Parker and Dodd 2005: 72) and the ceramic analysis conducted during the 2003 and 2004 field seasons (Parker et al. 2006: 84-94). The final phase of the Kenan Tepe assemblage is KTU Phase 4. The most important chronological marker for this phase is the stark increase in the num ber of Coba bowls, which rise from 1.93% (n = 68) 18 Round, simple-rim incurved bowls account for only 5.47% (n = 39), while flat-rim incurved bowls account for 3.28% (n = 18) of the rim sherd assemblage. 19 The closest parallel remains Yenice Yam Phase 5 (Bernbeck and Costello in press); however, the KTU Phase 3 assemblage is also closely paralleled at Tepe Gawra Level XIIA (Tobler 1950), Tell Hammam et-Turkman Phase IVC (Akkermans 1988a), and the End-cObed phase at Nineveh (Gut 1995).</page><page sequence="16">16 PARKER AND KENNEDY BASOR 358 Beta 180241:5880?40BP UTARP 68.2% probability \D.5.5080.5576 4795BC (68.2%) 4710BC 95.4% probability 4850BC (93.7%)4670BC 4640BC( 1.7%)4610BC 5200CalBC 5000CalBC 4800CalBC 4600CalBC Calibrated date | 5600BP | 5500BP 5400BP Beta 176373 : 5750?40BP UTARP 68.2% probability D 5 5142 8 4680BC (22.9%) 4630BC 4620BC (45.3%) 4540BC 95.4% probability 4710BC (95.4%) 4490BC 4600CalBC Calibrated date 5200CalBC 5000CalBC 4800CalBC 4600CalBC Calibrated date Beta 208202:5720?50BP UTARP 68.2% probability D.8.93.1 4660BC (4.0%) 4640BC 4620BC (64.2%) 4490BC 95.4% probability 4700BC (95.4%) 4450BC 5000CalBC 4800CalBC 4600CalBC Calibrated date 4400CalBC 4200CalBC Atmospheric data from Reimer et al.

Incurved-rim bowls with flat bases and flat rims also become more common. Incurved rim bowls with flat rims and those with round simple rims are both found with the same frequency, each accounting for 5.63% (n = 21) of the assemblage. The strongest ceramic parallel remains the Ubaid/Late Chalcolithic hamlet of Yenice Yam. The KTU Phase 4 assemblage also strongly resembles the published ceramics from Levels XIIA/XII at Tepe Gawra (Tobler 1950; Rothman 2002) and from Tell Leilan VIb (Schwartz 1988). The increased prevalence of Coba bowls in the assemblage, when combined with the morphological and stylistic comparisons, points to an early Terminal Ubaid (Late Chalcolithic 1) date for KTU Phase 4 (Rothman 2001).20 Fabric Clear trends are observable in the frequency of fabrics through time. The frequency of coarse fabrics in the overall assemblage decreases considerably 20 These data support the conclusions reached in the prelimi nary assessment of ceramic data from the 2003 and 2004 field sea sons, where we suggested that the Ubaid ceramic corpus from Kenan Tepe represents a Late Northern Ubaid (Ubaid 4) to Termi nal Ubaid assemblage (Parker et al. 2006: 94).

During the first three phases of the sequence, the frequency of fine fabrics remains rela tively constant, at just above 30%. However, the frequency of fine fabrics declines sharply in the final phase of the sequence, when it drops by more than 6%. Additionally, the most significant diachronic change in fabric frequency can be observed in the medium-fabric ceramics, which change from their low of 31.14% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 2 to 51.55% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 4. Surface Treatment The most marked diachronic trends in the fre quencies of surface treatments can be seen in the decrease in Burnished and Paint-on-Slip surface treat ments and the increase in the frequency of flint scraped sherds (fig. 10). Burnished sherds decrease more than 5% between KTU Phase 2 and KTU Phase 4. Likewise, sherds with Paint on Slip decrease from 14.21% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 1 to 9.70% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 4. Interestingly, while Paint on Slip decreases through time, there is a slight increase in the frequency of sherds exhibiting Paint on Untreated Fabric.

Frequency of Ubaid surface treatments through time. A more detailed view of diachronic trends in sur face treatment is visible when we consider changes within each fabric group. A number of these trends can be seen in the frequency figures for fine fabrics (fig. 11). These include a decrease in Paint on Slip and an increase in Paint on Untreated Fabric. As ex pected, the increase in scraped sherds is almost completely restricted to medium fabrics. It is also interesting to note that sherds belonging to the cate gory of Paint on Untreated Medium Fabric increase from 1.64% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 1 to 5.09% in KTU Phase 4. Coarse-fabric untreated sherds increase from their low of 37.69% of coarse fabric sherds to 57.84%. The frequency of coarse fabric burnished sherds decreases from its high of 32.03% of coarse-fabric sherds in KTU Phase 2 to 21.96% in KTU Phase 4. This decrease is paralleled by a decrease in coarse-fabric smoothed sherds, which changes from a high of 23.75% of course-fabric sherds in KTU Phase 2 to 8.24% in KTU Phase 4. Vessel Form Previously we noted that there is a strong bias toward open forms in the overall corpus of Ubaid rim sherds from Kenan Tepe. Interestingly, the percent ages of open and closed forms are quite consistent throughout the Kenan Tepe sequence.

Closed forms account for 20% of the rim sherd corpus in KTU Phase 1 and 21.72% in KTU Phase 4. The picture is similar when we divide the forms by vessel type: the change in the percentage of open bowls and storage jars between KTU Phase 1 and KTU Phase 4 is insignificant.21 Generally speaking, the most common rim forms remain relatively stable through time. The Rounded Straight Rim (which changes from 53.6% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 1 to 57.37% in KTU Phase 4), the Angle Rim Jar (which changes from 11.20% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 1 to 12.33% in KTU Phase 4), and the Tall Straight Necked Jar (which changes from 2% of the assem blage in KTU Phase 1 to 1.34% in KTU Phase 4) vary only slightly through time. There is, however, a significant dropoff in the percentage of Incurved Round Rims (which decrease from 13.2% of the as semblage in KTU Phase 1 to 5.63% in KTU Phase 4) and for the Everted Beaded Rim (which changes from 5.2% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 1 to 1.07% in KTU Phase 4). At the same time, the per centage of Flat Straight Rims more than doubles from its low of 2.4% of the assemblage in KTU Phase 1 to 4.83% in KTU Phase 4. 21 61.2% to 63.27% of the assemblage and 18.0% to 17.69% of the assemblage, respectively.</page><page sequence="19">2010 CERAMIC CORPUS FROM KENAN TEPE 19 Discussion Several interesting conclusions can be drawn from the data enumerated above. Hans Nissen (1988: 46) has convincingly argued that the introduction of the tournette (a pivoted working surface) during the Ubaid period sped up the process of ceramic decora tion and led to a simplification of decorative motifs between the Halaf and the Ubaid periods. Scholars generally agree that this trend continues through the Ubaid period, as the elaborately painted designs of the early Ubaid shift to simpler decorative motifs in later Ubaid phases. For example, Hammade and Yamazaki have commented that at Tell al-cAbr, the ceramic corpus becomes plainer and shows less vari ety through time (Hammade and Yamazaki 1995: 5). Akkermans has also noted that at Hammam et-Turk man, the ratio of painted ceramics declines signifi cantly from its high of 17.6% of the assemblage in Phase VIA to 2.4% of the assemblage in Phase IVD (Akkermans 1988a: 198). At Kenan Tepe, painted rim sherds steadily de crease from 46.8% of total rim sherds in KTU Phase 1 to 27.6% in KTU Phase 4. As noted above, KTU Phase 4 most likely represents an early Terminal Ubaid ceramic assemblage; however, the percentage of painted rim sherds is more closely paralleled by the earlier northern Ubaid assemblages from Tell Mashnaqa Level III (Thuesen 2000) and Tell Leilan Via (Schwartz 1988). There are two possible expla nations for the high percentage of painted rim sherds in KTU Phase 4. First, it is possible that the decline in Ubaid painted decoration occurred more slowly at Kenan Tepe. The second possibility is that the ceramic corpus at Kenan Tepe might represent a regional development in the Upper Tigris region in which Terminal Ubaid characteristics (namely, flint scraped bowls) occur earlier than elsewhere in north ern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have argued that, in conjunc tion with the changes in design, the well-levigated mineral-tempered fabrics of the earlier phases of the Ubaid period give way to rougher vegetal-tempered fabrics toward the end of the Ubaid period. Akker mans (1988b: 292) maintains that this increased emphasis on vegetal-tempered ceramics represents a further trend toward expedient ceramic production, since clays utilizing vegetal tempers require lower kiln temperatures and shorter firing times. The data from this study support this hypothesis. They show not only that the overall ratio of painted sherds de creases through time, but also that among painted sherds, there is a tendency toward simpler designs and a less frequent use of slip. At Kenan Tepe, there is also a significant drop in the ratio of sherds com posed of fine fabrics from KTU Phase 1 to KTU Phase 4. Interestingly, this decrease is accompanied not by an increase in the ratio of sherds composed of coarse fabrics, but instead by an increase in the ratio of sherds composed of medium fabrics. We suggest that as the social context changed to deemphasize painted ceramics, the functional categories that these ceramics fulfilled was slowly taken over by under rated vessels made of medium fabrics that were both less labor intensive to make and less costly to fire. SPATIAL OBSERVATIONS Archaeologists have long acknowledged that cer amics rarely remain in or near the contexts where they were used. Since people tend to clean activity areas, especially those that are used repeatedly, the spatial distribution of ceramics is not usually repre sentative of activities that took place in specific areas. For this reason, this section only considers cer amics that were collected from specific loci within and around the destruction layers of Kenan Tepe's Ubaid Structure 4. In an effort to keep the sample size as large as possible, we grouped the ceramics into three broad spatial categories: ceramics taken from the floors of Ubaid Structure 4, those taken from the collapse layer overlying those floors (which we assume fell from the roof of Ubaid Structure 4), and those collected from the exterior surfaces south of Ubaid Structure 4. (These categories are referred to as interior surfaces, roof collapse, and exterior surface in the following discussion.) Although the total number of sherds emanating from the interior surfaces and the roof collapse are reasonably large (n = 520 and n = 1,483, respec tively), the sample size from the exterior surfaces is unfortunately quite small (n = 154). In spite of this shortcoming, we believe that there is value in con sidering these data, even if the small sample size from the exterior surface may introduce a larger than-ideal margin of error. To make meaningful com parisons of artifact categories across varying spatial contexts, we calculated the density of different cate gories of ceramics by dividing the number of sherds by the volume of excavated soil to estimate the total number of sherds per m3 of archaeological deposit (Wright, Miller, and Redding 1980; Pollock 1999a).</page><page sequence="20">20 PARKER AND KENNEDY Table 13.

Burnished sherds were also more common on the exterior surfaces (53.06 recov ered per m3), compared with rates of 28.54 sherds per m3 on the interior surface of the structure and 8.71 sherds per m3 in the roof collapse. Flint-scraped sherds were relatively rare on interior surfaces (where only 1.35 sherds per m3 were recovered) and in the collapse layer (where 1.57 sherds per m3 were found). Slipped sherds were found most commonly on the interior surfaces (46.44 sherds per m3), but were also commonly found on the associated exterior surfaces (40.22 sherds per m3). Slipped sherds were less fre quently recovered from the roof collapse of the struc ture (where 14.99 sherds were recovered per m3). Both Painted on Slip and Paint on Untreated Fabric sherds were found most frequently on the interior floors of the structure (28.54 and 17.42 sherds per m3, respectively). Vessel Size In considering the distribution of various sized vessels among the corpus here analyzed, there is a clear dichotomy between interior and exterior sur faces. Sherds from small vessels were nearly twice as frequent on the interior surfaces (39.67 sherds per m3) as they were on exterior surfaces (20.11 sherds per m3) (table 13). In contrast, sherds from large vessels were more than three times as common on exterior surfaces (56.67 sherds per m3) than they were on interior surfaces (18.38 sherds per m3). Sherds from medium-size vessels were more evenly distributed between the interior (97.73 sherds per m3) and exterior (102.34 sherds per m3) surfaces, while being less frequently found in the roof collapse (33.63 sherds per m3). Extra-large-vessel sherds were only found in significant densities on the ex terior surfaces (10.97 sherds per m3). The data on the distribution of vessel size can be augmented by correlating it with fabric type. By far the most com mon vessel type from interior surfaces and from the collapse layer is the medium-size vessel composed of medium fabric, which was found at rates of 45.96 and 17.02 sherds per m3 from these spaces, respectively. The most common vessel type on the exterior surface is the medium-size vessel composed of coarse fabric (47.53 sherds per m3). Small and medium vessels composed of fine fabrics were fre quently found on the interior surfaces, where 26.12 fine-fabric small-vessel sherds and 27.09 fine-fabric medium-vessel sherds per m3 were recovered. Vessel Type The spatial distribution of rim types in and around Ubaid Structure 4 is shown in table 14. The most common rim type across all contexts is the Round</page><page sequence="21">2010 CERAMIC CORPUS FROM KENAN TEPE Table 14.

The vast majority of these bowls are the remains of relatively small vessels (with a rim diameter below 20 cm). Additionally, almost half (7 of 15) of the Simple Rim Bowls from outside sur faces are constructed of coarse fabric. Angle Rim Globular Jars also show significant variation across contexts. These vessels were recovered much more frequently from the exterior surfaces than they were from interior surfaces and the roof collapse. Al though very few large and extra-large vessels were discovered in the Kenan Tepe corpus, it is perhaps significant that a number of Straight Ledge Rim Jars belonging to large and extra-large storage jars were discovered in the roof collapse and on the outside surfaces. A number of the Straight Ledge Rim Jars discovered in the roof collapse contained or were directly associated with charred seeds. Discussion These data support a number of interesting hypoth eses. If we are correct in assuming that small and medium-size open bowls made of fine fabrics are indicative of serving (Bernbeck, Costello, and Unal 2004), then the data suggest that the consumption of food and/or the storage of serving vessels took place primarily on interior surfaces. Similar findings have been reported from other Ubaid households at Tell Madhhur (Roaf 1989; Pollock in press) and Tell Abada (Jasim 1985; Pollock in press) in the Hamrin, and at Degirmentepe (Gurdil 2006; Helwing 2003) on the Upper Euphrates. Additionally, the fact that much higher proportions of coarse-fabric cooking vessels were discovered on exterior surfaces sug gests that food preparation likely occurred there. The lack of hearths or ovens inside Ubaid Structure 4 supports this conclusion. The distribution of sherds belonging to medium, large, and extra-large storage vessels suggests that storage was concentrated on outside surfaces around, and on the roof of, Ubaid Structure 4. CONCLUSION The data presented in this paper allow a relatively precise characterization of the Ubaid assemblage from Kenan Tepe. In addition to adding new insights into the character of Ubaid ceramic assemblages, these data in many cases confirm or add new detail to hypotheses-based qualitative analyses or obser vations. In other cases, the data presented here con tradict commonly held assumptions about Ubaid assemblages. A number of published overviews aimed at intro ductory classes about the ancient Near East suggest that the Ubaid period is characterized by its painted ceramics. Hans Nissen, for example, devotes most of his discussion of the period to the technology behind and the implications of painted ceramics (Nissen 1988: 46-47). Michael Roaf gives the same impres sion when he speaks of the various phases of the Ubaid being characterized by different types of painted ceramics (Roaf 1990: 53-56). There are, of course, a number of reasons why painted Ubaid ceramics may be illustrated in larger numbers than the unpainted ceramics. First, many archaeologists often consider diagnostic ceramics to include rims, bases, handles, and decorated body sherds. This being the case, painted Ubaid body sherds may be sorted into a dif ferent analytical category than plain body sherds and</page><page sequence="22">PARKER AND KENNEDY BASOR 358 thus may receive differential treatment in publica tions. It is also true that if a site report, especially a preliminary report, intends to give a sample of the variety of remains at a site, there may be an inclina tion to publish more painted sherds, since there is likely to be significant variation among painted mo tifs. In any case, it can be argued that, in the case of the Ubaid, a bias toward the publication of painted ceramics, which at least at Kenan Tepe and Hammam et-Turkman make up a relatively small percentage of the ceramic assemblages, has colored scholarly perceptions of the period. The quantitative ceramic data discussed in this paper allow a number of interesting observations about Ubaid society and culture. To begin with, very few studies have offered data pertinent to the study of Ubaid foodways. By correlating sooting with vessel shape, this study isolates two types of cooking vessels. The first is the Short Angle Rim Jar (fig. 6A-C). Pat terns of sooting on these vessels suggest that this type of cookpot was likely supported by andirons, or balanced by stones, over charcoal or dung fires. The size and shape of these vessels suggest that they were primarily used for heating or slow-cooking well-saturated foods such as soups, stews, or por ridge (Bottero 2004: 52-53). The second shape iden tified as part of the Ubaid cooking vessel assemblage is a very open version of the Rounded Straight Rim Bowl (fig. 6D-G). Due to their open shape, we hypothesize that these bowls were probably used for frying or baking foods that were not heavily sat urated and/or they functioned as bread molds. Our spatial analysis shows that cooking vessels were con centrated on the outside surfaces south of Kenan Tepe's Ubaid Structure 4. This observation, com bined with the fact that no features that could be in terpreted as cooking facilities were discovered within this structure, suggests that cooking was performed in outdoor hearths or was concentrated in the unex cavated portions of Ubaid Structure 4. The data pre sented here also show not only that serving vessels are often painted and constructed of fine fabrics, but also that they are usually relatively small. Such vessels were concentrated on interior surfaces. These data support several interesting hypotheses. First, it appears the consumption of food, at least at the time of the destruction of Ubaid Structure 4, took place indoors. Second, the small size of serving vessels suggests that foods were divided into individ ual servings. This indicates that communal consump tion from large platters or bowls was likely a trend that began after the Terminal Ubaid period. And fi nally, the fact that many of the finely made painted ceramics probably functioned as serving vessels al lows for some speculation about the function of some of the painted ceramics. These data suggest that some aspects of the social meaning encoded in Ubaid ceramic painted decorations may be tied to consump tion or perhaps feasting (Helwing 2003). Another interesting observation about the Kenan Tepe Ubaid ceramic assemblage is the scarcity of large and extra-large storage vessels. Our ongoing analysis of the Ubaid architecture, stratigraphy, and material remains shows that the small cell rooms east of Ubaid Structure 4 were almost certainly used for grain storage. All or most other goods or mate rials were stored in medium-size vessels. This ob servation brings us to the issue of capacity and transportability (Rice 1987: 226). Although capacity measurements have not been included in our statis tical analysis, two things are clear. First, even when full, medium-size storage vessels would have been movable. And second, the amount of foodstuffs or other goods or materials contained within these vessels was extremely limited. This suggests that Kenan Tepe's Ubaid domestic economy emphasized the production, storage, and perhaps exchange of relatively small quantities of goods. We speculate that such goods were likely periodically consumed by, or exchanged between, relatively small house hold groups. Akkermans and Schwartz (2003: 169) argue that the diminishing percentage of Ubaid painted cer amics suggests that these vessels "gradually lost their central role in social contexts." They further ar gue that the adoption of coarse ceramics represents an adaptation to changing socioeconomic demands (Akkermans and Schwartz 2003: 170). Two lines of data from Kenan Tepe support these hypotheses. First, our data show a decrease both in vessels com posed of fine fabrics and of those with painted deco ration. This decrease is paralleled by an increase in undecorated ceramics composed of medium fabrics that are often in similar forms to their decorated counterparts. These data suggest that in the latter half of the Ubaid period, the social meaning origi nally filled by the painted fine wares slowly changed and the practical functions that they served were taken over by more mundane ceramics that were less labor intensive to produce. The data presented here also uphold several as sumptions about Coba bowls. First, our analysis sup</page><page sequence="23">2010 CERAMIC CORPUS FROM KENAN TEPE 23 ports the chronological association of Coba bowls with the final phases of the Ubaid period (Rova 1999-2000; Schwartz 2001). It also confirms both that Coba bowls make up a relatively small percent age of the overall assemblage and that their ratio increases through time. However, Schwartz (2001: 236) states that Coba bowls at several sites in Syria are composed of "crude, incompletely oxidized" fabrics. Our research shows that at Kenan Tepe and Yenice Yam (Kennedy 2008) in the Upper Tigris Valley and at Degirmentepe on the Upper Euphrates (Gurdil 2006), Coba bowls are constructed of pre dominantly well-fired medium fabrics. These obser vations suggest that a number of local, regional, and supraregional cultural conventions guided the man ufacture of ceramics used at Kenan Tepe. Following Thuesen (1989: 435), our analysis also suggests that the end of the Ubaid period is marked by a shift away from regional interconnections to ward the development of local cultural traditions. The Kenan Tepe corpus shows strong similarities, especially in vessel form and decorative motifs, to Ubaid-period ceramics discovered at various sites spread over a very wide geographic area, including southern (cOueili, Ras al-Amiya), central (Tell Abada, Tell Madhhur), and northern Iraq (Tepe Gawra), Syria (Hammam et-Turkman, Tell al-cAbr, Tell Zi yadeh, Tell Kosak Shamali), and Turkey (Tell Kurdu, Degirmentepe). Nissen (2001) argues that this pro cess occurred through what he calls "Ubaid interac tion spheres" which linked communities through an extensive system of regional communication and sym metrical exchange relationships. Although ceramic parallels clearly place Kenan Tepe's Ubaid-period occupation within the orbit of the Late Ubaid tradi tion, there are also tendencies toward localized styles (Pollock 1999b: 3). The almost complete lack of surface texturing other than flint scraping and the prevalence of local painted motifs (especially posi tive and negative Concentric Circles and figurative motifs) are good examples. The Kenan Tepe data suggest, therefore, that the Ubaid regional material tradition was varyingly adopted and adapted to meet the needs of local communities. REFERENCES Akkermans, P. M. M.
