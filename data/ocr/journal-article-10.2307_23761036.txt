Concerning the observed hieroglyphic inscriptions at San Simon, Dunning (written communication, September 1993), provided the additional information that he discov ered glyphic fragments in an albarrada not far from a large mound on the outskirts of the village and that there are some photographs of glyphic fragments in the archives of the Centro Regional Yucatan, INAH, in Merida, of stone lintels or doorjambs. The latest checklist of Maya archaeological sites with hieroglyphic inscriptions compiled by Ian Graham (Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions, Vol. 6, Pt. 3, pp. 187-188, 1999, Cambridge, Massachusetts ) does not mention San Simon as an archaeological site featuring monumental hieroglyphic inscriptions. In March 1999, mexicon staff members Stephan Merk and Karl Herbert Mayer, guided by Rogelio Colli Mo from San Simon visited several mounds to the WNW of the village, approximately 150 metres distant from San Simon's plaza, and observed in the debris of a collapsed Puuc structure, comprising evidently the principal building of this destroyed architectural complex, a severely eroded limestone fragment with traces of a hieroglyphic inscription. The precise geo graphical location of this part of the ruins was determined with a hand-held GPS navigator who provided the following readings: 20° 12.17' N, 89° 48.66' W. The glyphic stone, allegedly first seen in December of 1998 by inhabitants of San Simon, is broken and incomplete and shows on a narrow, rectangular surface the outlines of more than five glyph blocks, all of them illegible because of extreme weathering (Fig. 2). Typologically, the stone slab may be a lintel, al though this preliminary classification is not entirely certain. The actual width of the sculpture is 107 cm, the rectangular textual image measures 17 cm in height and 84 cm in width. This recent find confirms Dunning's statements of the exist- Fig. 3.
