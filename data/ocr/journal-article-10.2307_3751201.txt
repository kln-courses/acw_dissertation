<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise BRIAN GRANT Locke reports, in his discussion of substance and with some amuse- ment, on the Indian philosopher who, when asked what the earth rests on, postulated an elephant and then, when asked in turn about the elephant, decided to go with a tortoise. Locke's amusement, of course, is justified. But it is also tempered if not downright equivo- cal. For he sees that at some point a very special elephant or-if we stick to the Indian's story-a very special tortoise will have to be invoked. Locke's own tortoise, or elephant, substratum or sub- stance, has some very peculiar properties or, alternatively, an equally alarming lack of them-so much so that, as he is painfully aware, it might well seem totally implausible. Enough of Locke though. Wittgenstein's problem, unlike Locke's, lies in epistemolo- gy. His elephant consists of an indefinitely large and varied set of bench-marks or paradigms-Moore's examples, in fact, along with some additions-that function as an epistemological 'foundation', 'river bed', 'bedrock', 'rock bottom', a 'substratum', no less. Where is the tortoise? Wittgenstein's answer to this is that there is no tor- toise, none at all. A non-existent tortoise, however, is as unaccept- able here as a regular common-or-garden one. Even the Indian realized that an elephant is no good without a tortoise. I want, in this paper, to give an account of the peculiar sort of tortoise required by Wittgenstein's elephant. But before getting into episte- mology, certain aspects of Wittgenstein's views about philosophy in general and the nature of philosophical tools must be considered.1 1 Locke's Indian philosopher appears on pp. 230 and 392 of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (ed. Campbell Fraser), Vol. I, Dover, 1959. The two papers by G. E. Moore that are essential reading in connection with Wittgenstein's epistemological views are 'A Defence of Common Sense', Contemporary British Philosophy (ed. Muirhead), Allen and Unwin, 1925, and 'Proof of the External World', Proceedings of the British Acad- emy, 1939-both reprinted in Philosophical Papers, Allen &amp; Unwin, 1959. The present paper is largely concerned with On Certainty, Blackwell, 1969. But there is also considerable discussion of relevant parts of the Philosophical Investigations, Blackwell, 1953, and, occasionally, some- thing comes up from the Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, M.I.T., 1978. I quote fairly extensively though often no more than an individual word or phrase and give a specific location only when it seems, for one reason or another, important. Philosophy 70 1995 191</page><page sequence="2">Brian Grant I am not going to be concerned, or not directly or at length, with Wittgenstein's well-known doctrines about criteria, family resem- blances, meaning and use and the alleged inappropriateness of theories in philosophy. I am, rather, going to concentrate on his preoccupation with the imprecise or the incomplete, his sugges- tions about the proper categories of philosophical assessment or the notion of grammar, the wide-ranging anti-Foundational attitudes he expresses and the disturbing hints of conventionalism, of natural history and how we operate and how the world presents itself to us, this species you and I belong to of moderately advanced and intelli- gent human beings. So as for the imprecise or unfinished. What counts as exact or otherwise often depends on the context. Some points are clear though. The ideal of logical rigour and decisiveness, of doing everything absolutely transparently and exhaustively to the last detail in philosophy, of doing it equipped with nothing but the notions of entailment and necessity and endorsing only tautolo- gies or the most elementary logical truisms-all this is deeply misguided. Not only that, it has crippled philosophy for more than two thousand years. There have, to be sure, been occasional signs of uneasiness with Kant arguing for a sort of truth that is both synthetic and a priori and even the Positivists allowing, on the other side of the coin, for an undifferentiated kind of gibber- ish. And philosophers are as adept as anyone at ignoring, in their practice, what they preach. But philosophy, that most refined and universal of disciplines, ought to be tight-tight and formal.2 Things are, according to Wittgenstein, much 'rougher' than that in philosophy. The word everyday and non-technical, almost not big enough, one feels, for the view. There are 'boundaries that have not been drawn' in our concept of a game, a number or lan- guage and 'good' has a 'family of meanings'. We don't have 'rules to cover' all possible eventualities in the career of a physical object, and words and propositions, our descriptions and our defi- nitions even are subject to 'friction and air-resistance'. We can imagine all sorts of cases of understanding, thinking and negation, each of them significantly different from the rest. A 'great variety of criteria' are employed for identity so that the many uses of 'is' do not 'yield a single meaning'. No sharp distinction can be made between the essential and inessential, the random and systematic or the mistaken or otherwise and our rules are not, and cannot be, 2 See Ayer's Language, Truth and Logic, Gollancz, 1936, for a charac- teristically straightforward statement of the methods and goals of Positivism-and if The Critique of Pure Reason (trans. Meiklejohn), Dent, 1934, isn't tight, what is? 192</page><page sequence="3">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise hard and fast in all respects. They contain loopholes and gaps and our concepts-including that of a rule-are often 'blurred'. So we have to resort, at times, to the normal case or normal circum- stances and our 'usuallys' and 'other things being equals', our 'so toos for other similar cases' and 'for examples' and the examples themselves cannot be dispensed with. The examples have or should have a life of their own, one that enables them not merely to punctuate an account or a description but to colour or shape it, to give it force, to give it direction. But they are still examples. So there is, in the Investigations and the other later works, an obses- sion, a religion almost to roughness or inexactness or to the inevitably unfinished. Wittgenstein is, I think, obviously right here. If this is what should be ordinary or homespun about our philosophical language-as it is for Wittgenstein-one can only agree. Our questions are 'framed in this language', he says; 'they had to be if there was anything to ask'! It is an odd sociological fact that many people continue to believe that the only good philosopher is a formal one-though why not a historian, say, or a journalist?3 But this is only one reason for objecting to the ideal of logical purity in philosophy. More importantly but not unrelatedly, our categories of philosophical assessment have to be entirely rethought. We were all taught, or most of us were, to rely on the distinction between the necessary and the contingent or, perhaps, on that between the analytic and the synthetic, or the a priori and a posteriori. There have, again, been occasional ripples of dissat- isfaction but a great deal of weight has been placed on some such two-fold splitting-up of the available territory. Consider the first of these distinctions. Philosophers sometimes define one half of it by exclusion; sometimes they offer positive definitions for each half. But one of these categories at least will have to be enor- mously broad and so not very helpful. As though I were to say 'I know of two kinds of people; those who eat kidneys or exercise daily and those who don't'. Philosophers, however, mostly rely on just the two categories-the contingent or empirical, whether true or false, the experimental, fortuitous or brutely happen- stance, and the necessary or logical, the sort of truth that we philosophers are supposed to strive after and mathematicians too it seems. What does 'necessary' mean? There are various accounts but it is usually given a pretty strict definition in The remark about our questions is from #120 of the Investigations- and the contrast between the ordinary and the logically complete and precise is quite explicit in #98 and #105-#108. #107, incidentally, con- cludes with the admonition 'Back to the rough ground'. 193</page><page sequence="4">Brian Grant philosophy. So it is often said to be that whose denial is contra- dictory or a matter of affirming and denying one and the same thing in a single breath-and our favourite illustrations are of the marital condition of bachelors or the geometrical properties of squares. And for the contingent, we are, perversely, accustomed to thinking in terms of an equally narrow range of examples-to the effect that the chair over there is three feet from the wall or stained dark brown or that Swedes are frequently humourless or the French formidable lovers and unnervingly sophisticated besides. Two kinds of truth and two kinds of falsity. There are philosophers who worry about how the necessary maps on to the analytic, say, or the analytic on to the a priori. Kant is one and Kripke is another. But the tradition is much more blind and goes much deeper. The hold it has on philosophers can't be broken like that.4 Wittgenstein insists, as a corrective, on criteria and family resemblances and 'a logic that is not used'. There is nonsense and nonsense and therefore sense and sense-and one might nearly make sense or just barely. Philosophers need to concern themselves with 'natural history' and the 'fluctuation between symptoms and criteria'. Our concepts have 'importance', 'significance' or 'point', so they express and direct our 'interests'. They involve or presup- pose a 'scaffolding of facts', and certain paradigms of what used to be thought of as empirical knowledge belong to our 'frame of refer- ence' or 'picture of the world'. And for some possibilities, it is worth noting that 'one has to imagine a Deity in connection with them'. The 'civil status of a contradiction' is not what logicians would have us believe and the a priori, Wittgenstein suggests, is- merely?-'very convincing to us'. And then, again and again, the emphasis on the normal and your average standard case and the philosophical endorsements that take the form: This is what we do. Some philosophical views are contradictory but others are 'alle- gories', 'dreams' or 'image-mongery' and philosophical confusions arise when language is 'idling' or 'goes on holiday'. I want to try to say, perhaps in a more summary fashion than Wittgenstein would have approved of, what some of this amounts to. 4 The above sort of two-fold distinction was finally given its proper place in the tradition by the Verification Principle. Language, Truth and Logic, in particular, succeeded in summing up a more than two thousand year old tradition in a form in which its rigidity and its poverty were right on the surface. So it sounded, for some of us at any rate and in ret- rospect at least, the death knell of the tradition. See Kripke's Naming and Necessity (Oxford: Blackwell, 1980), for an attempt to insulate the necessary from the a priori. 194</page><page sequence="5">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise It isn't that there are no necessary truths. Neither do I know of any good reason for thinking Wittgenstein denied that there are. A square must, on pain of contradiction, have four sides, four angles and so on. But what does this leave us with? Let's assume that the 'contingently' true is that which simply happens to be true. It could easily have been false instead and is true because the uni- verse we inhabit just is like that. If it hadn't been, that too would have been quite unsurprising. So everything else is 'non-contin- gent' or 'conceptual' or 'grammatical'. Are there grammatical truths-or grammatical truths that go beyond or stop short of what is necessary? Are there mistakes or failures to understand other than contradicting oneself and being wrong about the brute way the world is? Of course there are. Competing, following rules and being amusing are ingredients in our concept of a game but they are not necessary or sufficient conditions. And if they, and all the other criteria Wittgenstein mentions, are thought of as empirical truths about games or some games or as falsehoods perhaps, the concept needed to make sense of this would not be ours. What we have here is not some artificial or esoteric philosophical view. There just are, without the slight- est trace of metaphor, these family resemblances: the Churchill face, for example, or the odd similarities among the aunts and uncles on your father's side. All sorts of concepts have this kind of structure-though this is perfectly compatible with our coming up with necessary truths about them. The concept of a tree or a bird, a town or a church, of a government or law or statement, of intelligence, education or knowledge or of reward or virtue or action-all these and countless others have it. The concepts of a criterion and a language-game have it as well. These concepts are not all exactly alike however. So there is the possibility of new kinds of irrationality. But this is only the beginning-for we can look at things from a different and much broader perspective. The notion of rationality or of what makes sense lies at the heart of philosophy. There is the question of what rationality is and what proof is and argument. There is also the question of what it is to be epistemologically rational or that of the standards, evidential or otherwise, for knowledge and reasonable belief And what is it, we might ask, to make philosophical sense and how rational, right or acceptable are our concepts, these attempts of ours to come to grips with some part or aspect of reality? They fit or they don't-or so we think. So the notion of rationality or sense means a lot to us philosophers. We might even say that philosophy is nothing but a sustained and systematic effort to define it. 195</page><page sequence="6">Brian Grant There are all kinds of criteria for rationality. Or-and this is another way of putting the point-there are all kinds of irration- ality or senselessness. For each example of the latter can be seen as the mirror-image of one more criterion. We can, of course, misrepresent the connections of sense between the concept of a game and its criteria. Or we could behave as though the past had no epistemological relation to the future or the now perceived to what is still out of sight-or we could to some extent. The text- books of abnormal psychology are full of such cases together with assessments that are typically more realistic than those that philosophers are inclined to offer-not because psychologists are brighter or more sensible than philosophers but simply because they don't have the same problems or hang-ups, the same history to get in their way. Or we could believe that the telephones are all a conspiracy or that every third sentence, but only the third, that we read is true. We might find it impossible to drown out the ter- ror or anger or spend most of our time talking to demons or counting loose change or the children we've had since last week. We could believe that this table isn't a table but a disciple of God-and someone might be convinced that he doesn't exist or that he does but the world he inhabits doesn't. Contradictions? Contingent falsehoods? These categories aren't even contenders. It is not that the canons of sense or rationality that are relevant to abnormal psychology constitute a subset, even an important sub- set, of the truths that might interest a philosopher. Perhaps some of them are beside the present point; what can we learn from cata- tonia, for example, or a case of empty simpering optimism? And maybe some of them would never have been thought of it it were not for abnormal psychology. But any truth that a philosopher might think of could be violated in a clinical case. Then again, there are abnormalities of completely different kinds. Being a member of a just discovered Stone Age tribe, being raised in a cage in the dark, having a catastrophically low I.Q. or no emo- tions or memory at all. For someone like that, reality might seem dim or twisted or strange.5 If there are all kinds of nonsense, there are all kinds of truth. I know Wittgenstein might have balked at this sort of use of 'truth' and he sometimes argues, though surely unpersuasively, that if something doesn't make sense then neither does its opposite. So why not say that it's true that we're not alone, that we were born 5 Wisdom discusses various parallels between philosophy and abnor- mal psychology in 'Philosophy and Psychoanalysis', Polemic, 1946, and 'Philosophy, Metaphysics and Psychoanalysis'-both contained in Philosophy and Psychoanalysis, Blackwell, 1953. 196</page><page sequence="7">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise and will die and that fire bums and food nourishes? Let's say that it's true that there is such a thing as a 'healthy human understand- ing'. So there are all kinds of truths and all kinds of philosophical truths in particular. Some of them are scientific truths. For there can be no sharp distinction between the more theoretically empirical and the grammatical or conceptual, and Wittgenstein talks of science changing our concepts-of water and gold or of force or time or the mind. Science is not, after all, concerned with what just hap- pens to be true or to turn up on the other side of a magnifying- glass or a microscope. Or if it is, we need a different sort of description for the fall being a bit late this year or someone's finding a quarter exactly where he'd lost twenty dollars some time before. If scientific theory 'depends on a hundred acci- dents', as Hume might be supposed to have taught us, some things depend on a million. And then some things, as Wittgenstein points out, are facts, not so much of science, but our natural history. That we eat and sleep, are curious and can communicate, are this sort of size and can move about and have a handful of senses instead of dozens are woven into and underlie our concepts. And some are simple straightforward facts like 'Here is a hand' or there is a fire, a dressing gown and a piece of wax. So even if something does just happen to be true, it still might be made use of by a philosopher. But I don't mean to sug- gest that this new liberal attitude towards philosophical cate- gories is confined to statements or claims. What is sometimes called the 'leading principle' of an argument is a statement or claim so we have the possibility of new forms of argument. Arguments that rely on entailment are or ought to be few and far between in philosophy, for there are all sorts of argumentative forms or patterns of persuasion. Neither do all arguments have clearly identifiable premises and a conclusion. And arguments blend into statements or remarks and a proposition can be expressed with enough enthusiasm, bias or flair to constitute or have the impact of an argument.6 A philosophical view can be mistaken. It might, once again, be 6 Hume says in his definition of 'matters of fact', a notion that for him includes scientific generalizations, that they 'depend on a hundred differ- ent accidents'-Treatise of Human Nature (ed. Selby-Bigge), Oxford, 1978, 69. The fire, the dressing gown and the piece of wax are, of course, Descartes's version of Moore's hand. See Meditations I and II in The Philosophical Works of Descartes (trans. Haldane and Ross), Vol. I, Cambridge, 1931. 197</page><page sequence="8">Brian Grant mistaken because it is contradictory. It will usually be wrong or confused on other grounds as well. So if a philosophical view is right, that won't determine its character at all precisely. Philosophical truths, as I've said, can be of many different kinds. Wittgenstein's anti-Foundational views are already evident in this brief and sometimes negative sketch of some of his views about philosophy in general. I am going to turn now to epistemol- ogy where the anti-Foundationalism plays an essential role in a defence against scepticism. The target of On Certainty is not so much scepticism as Moore's reaction to it. Nevertheless, a fairly detailed anti-sceptical position does emerge. Descartes is the obvious villain here. If one is worried about scepticism with regard to the external world, one might, given a belief in a mental component to perception, attempt to anchor the physical in the mental. One might, certainly, if one also believed in the impossibility of being wrong about one's own mind and thought the connection could be deductively secured. Otherwise, it might not be clear how this could meet the sceptical challenge. So one's own mind, indeed one's bare thinking self, is the foundation for Descartes of knowledge of the external world-and in the end of all knowledge. Wittgenstein, not sur- prisingly, has other ideas. He maintains that all of Moore's epis- temological paradigms as well as some candidates of his own- that the earth has existed for more than five minutes, that there are other men and women around who argue and think and dream and that this is a hand and that's a desk, and a variety of explicitly first-person examples like the fact that one means what one does by a word or being sure of one's name-all these basic convictions or takings-for-granted of ours have a 'peculiar logical role'. They are not necessary, or not on the usual accounts of that notion, but neither are they 'hypotheses'. This is not, again, a clear-cut distinction but someone who questioned such things would, Wittgenstein claims, have to be suffering from a mental disturbance or believe in magic perhaps. Indeed, our acceptance of these paradigms is a test of our understanding of them. They are the 'frame-work' within which 'enquiry and experiment can go on'. For while the paradigms are, to some extent, independent of one another and 'do not form a hierarchy', our beliefs or brute acceptances are parts of a 'system'. So a general account of epis- temological standards can be given, however rough. Some of the paradigms are associated with evidence. The evidence is no more certain than they are, though, and it is typically, when articulat- ed, strangely fragmentary or inconclusive. Others have no rela- tion to evidence. But in either case, these epistemological bench- 198</page><page sequence="9">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise marks are immune from doubt-or they are, at least, in normal circumstances. Doubt 'only works in a language-game' but the possibility of satisfying oneself' is one of a language-game's 'essential features'.7 Is this a satisfactory response to the sceptic? Not as it stands, at any rate. Mad or a believer in magic-or a sceptic, one thinks. And the sceptic does seem to understand. Maybe he doesn't play our language-game but no neutrally described concept of a language- game is going to bother him. He is well aware of how people talk- even relatively conscientious and intelligent people. He just finds it regrettable, that's all. And doesn't Wittgenstein say our alle- giance to our paradigms has no foundations, is arational and mere- ly conventional? 'The difficulty', he insists, 'is to realize the groundlessness of our believing'. Our certainty 'lies beyond being justified or unjustified'; it is, rather, 'something animal' and 'what men consider reasonable or unreasonable' changes over time and is not everywhere the same. So isn't Wittgenstein, not a critic of scepticism, but a sceptic himself?8 7 Descartes does, it should be said, sometimes maintain-as he does at the beginning of Meditation III-that God is the ultimate foundation. I promised not to talk about language-games. But a word about a view that is, in the Investigations, inextricably tied to the notion, the view that a community is required for language. I think that this is a pernicious view and that Wittgenstein's arguments for it are fatally flawed. It gets very little press in On Certainty, surfacing in #298 and one or two other places-although Wittgenstein often puts his views, quite naturally, in terms of 'us' or 'human beings'. There are two questions. Did even Wittgenstein believe that On Certainty needs propping up with this creaky and problematic view from the Investigations? Does it in fact? I think the answers are 'Apparently not or not obviously' and 'No' But that doesn't matter. What does is that many accounts of On Certainty are compromised from the outset by the unreasoned assumption that one or both of these questions should be answered affirmatively. See, for exam- ple, Strawson's Skepticism and Naturalism: Some Varieties, Columbia, 1985. And see Marie McGinn's Sense and Certainty, Blackwell, 1989, which is shot through with the notion of a community or a practice. 8Wittgenstein's uneasy relationship with scepticism has been noted by others. See Kripke, Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language, Harvard, 1982, and Simon Blackburn, Spreading the Word, Oxford, 1984-and see Strawson for some more general concerns. This sort of thing can get out of hand though. So Wittgenstein is a 'Pyrrhonian sceptic' for Fogelin in Wittgenstein, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1987, and both a 'sceptic' and a 'phenomenalist' at once for John Cook in 'The Metaphysics of Wittgenstein's On Certainty,' Philosophical Investigations, 1985. But scepticism preoccupied Wittgenstein-and it is still very much in the air. It is central to the ongoing debate between Realists and anti-Realists. As 199</page><page sequence="10">Brian Grant He isn't or he tries not to be. But the line that has to be walked here is extremely fine. On Certainty is also the least finished of Wittgenstein's important later works and he speaks of 'fighting windmills' and 'doing philosophy like an old woman who is con- stantly mislaying something'. There is the recurring and never very convincing dispute with Moore. We would say we knew all these things if the occasion arose or we could, as Wittgenstein sometimes seems to recognize-just as we could talk of the 'truth' and of 'facts' besides. An argument Wittgenstein sometimes ventures in this con- nection is that if one can't learn or suspect, if one can't doubt or be mistaken, one can't know either. It is no more persuasive, surely, than an argument that concludes, from these very same premises, that one must have a truly remarkable kind of knowledge. And Wittgenstein's argument is especially odd coming, as it does, from a philosopher who dismisses an opponent in the Investigations by say- ing, 'As if we were talking about shades of meaning and all that were in question were to find words to hit on the correct nuance'. For even though we don't know, allegedly, or can't, anyway, say we do, we are 'satisfied', 'sure', 'comfortably', or 'unshakeably convinced' and the paradigms are 'irreversible beliefs', they are 'solid' and 'stand fast' for us. Then there are the constant references to our 'act- ing' or 'behaving' and the 'animal' and to the child or the squirrel and its non-linguistic inductive performances. What is going on? Behaviour, non-linguistic or otherwise, can be blind, misguided or rest on a glaring falsehood. Ask a lemming or someone depraved. So that won't solve any sceptical problems either. But whose behaviour and whose actions are at issue-and what sort of animal are we?9 9 The remark about shades of meaning is from #254 of the Investigations. The seeds of Wittgenstein's argument, which comes up from time to time in On Certainty, can be found in the Investigations, #246 and p. 221. It contains other flaws as well as those I have mentioned but it seems not to be an argument that has impressed many philosophers. A spirited though in the end unsatisfactory defence of it is given by Cook in C. B. Martin puts it: '[Philosophers] will unashamedly use the skeptic to frighten off an opponent and to effect for themselves the most terrible reductions, ontic irresolutions, and debilitating relativities. They do not even stop to think that they may be running scared', 'Antirealism and the World's Undoing' Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 1984. Martin's com- ment is made as a preface to a discussion of Davidson and Putnam but it also applies to Dummett. Martin's own response to scepticism, however, is not much better. His only suggestion is that we would be somehow hard done by if the sceptic were right and we were wrong. Descartes thought this too-but at least he had God to turn to when it occurred to him that the world might be epistemologically unfair. 200</page><page sequence="11">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise There is, in On Certainty, what might seem to be a puzzling emphasis on human beings and a nagging discomfort about alter- native epistemological life-styles: the king brought up to believe that the world began with him or that he can make rain, the man who is convinced that a mountain just came into existence and the most bizarre communities and tribes. Some of these and maybe all of them are human however. So the notion we really want is not merely that of a human being but one who is adult, competent, reasonably intelligent, educated perhaps and halfway civilized- and if a child or squirrel then provides us with an illuminating or forceful analogy, we don't have to deny it. But what, we should ask, is a human being like that doing in epistemology? That sort of human being was put there by the sceptic, not Wittgenstein. Sceptics come in all shapes and sizes. There are scep- tics in various epistemological areas or for various reasons or who doubt more or less. But a philosophical sceptic is one who torments us with our human condition-or with that of the better or best among us. That's what makes him philosophical and not simply hard to please. Some people are hard to please epistemologically without being philosophers; they are, rather, a bit more exacting or grudging than the rest of us. The philosophical sceptic is different. He need not rely on the fact that we make mistakes. Neither need he rely on a mere logical possibility. He can point to indefinitely many possibilities in a given area that are beyond the power of human beings to rule out or directly address, indefinitely many ways in which our ingenuity or intelligence and our perceptual abilities are pretty severely limited. A lot of these counter-possibilities could be taken seriously by an evil genius though-and all of them could by God. So this notion of a human being, suitably qualified, has to be emphasized in any response to scepticism. Otherwise, it will miss or slide right by the sceptical arguments. It won't be a response. There are, then, only two choices. We can cave in and become 'Wittgenstein on Privacy', Philosophical Review, 1965-reprinted in Wittgenstein (ed. Pitcher), Doubleday, 1966. Further discussion can be found in John Canfield, "'I know that I am in pain" is Senseless', Analysis and Metaphysics (ed. Lehrer), Reidel, 1975-reprinted in The Philosophy of Wittgenstein, Vol. 8 (ed. Canfield), Garland, 1986-and Newton Garver, 'Neither Knowing nor not Knowing', Philosophical Investigations, 1984. Wittgenstein also offers other criticisms of Moore in On Certainty- that there is, for example, something inappropriately personal in Moore's saying 'I know' and that Moore's procedure implies both that knowledge is an introspectible state and that it guarantees its object. These criticisms strike me as desperate attempts to convict Moore of something, of any- thing, over and above the familiar charge of question-begging. 201</page><page sequence="12">Brian Grant sceptics. Or we can try to show that we are not obliged to consider these counter-possibilities, or not for epistemological purposes and not with regard to the paradigms. This still leaves plenty of room for human ignorance or mistake. But our acceptance of the para- digms, we might say, is a leap of human faith. How does this help? Doesn't it make everything arbitrary? Hume thought so and was, at times and over some issues, a completely committed sceptic. But there is, in On Certainty, a more Kantian theme-though without all the paraphernalia. And is it faith exact- ly? Or is it the simple acknowledgment that, as far as our paradigms are concerned, we are right? The epistemological standards, whether evidential or not, employed by us more or less bright and non-Neanderthal human beings are tailor-made to our epistemological talents. If they were linked to those of an evil genius who could deceive us about the external world, say, but who did not possess the infinite gifts of God, that would, for us, be absurdly arbitrary. Such standards are much higher than ours-and God's, of course, are higher still. He might, after all, have to remind Himself of the imminent famine or flood He has planned, the latest Martian scheme to wipe out the earth or the deplorable lack of human compassion exhibited by the evil genius. But the non-divine and anthropomorphic standards we rely on allow that 'a doubt is not necessary even when it is possi- ble'. Any non-divine standards must. And speaking of such mat- ters, the sceptic has another weapon. It is the principle 'If I know, I can't be wrong' or 'If I might be wrong, I don't know'. This one, however, is easier to defuse. The 'might' and the 'can't' have to be understood in terms of expressions of or refusals to doubt and not in terms of possibilities. The real issue is that of the adequacy of our standards-not because of the logical possibility of being wrong, but in a limitless sea of counter-possibilities. So reasonable belief is threatened by the sceptic as well as knowledge.?1 10 The sceptic does employ other weapons-especially in particular cases. But the above are, I think, the two most important general weapons. See #392 of On Certainty for Wittgenstein's remark about doubt. It reads in full: 'What I need to show is that a doubt is not neces- sary even when it is possible'. And see Austin's 'Other Minds', Aristotelian Society, Supp. Vol., 1946, reprinted in Philosophical Papers (ed. Urmson and Warnock), Oxford, 1961, for some interesting sugges- tions about the above principle. Counter-possibilities,by the way, are most naturally thought of as compatible with what is not in question but conflicting with what is. The notion is, in fact, broader than that as should be clear from Gettier's 'Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?', Analysis, 1963, reprinted in various places. The point is emphasized by Barry Stroud in The Significance of Philosophical Scepticism, Oxford, 1984. 202</page><page sequence="13">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise Is the connection between our epistemological practices and so our concept of knowledge, on the one hand, and our limited human nature on the other a connection of meaning? Wittgenstein sometimes tries such a move but I am not convinced it will do. Our standards for being a decent accountant or a promising base- ball player, for greed, generosity or tolerance and for being a saint or sinner are tied to human nature. Are they tied by meaning? Not, I think, in any very clear sense of that word. But I have no qualms about letting the notion of grammar cover more than that of being true in virtue of meaning. It is, certainly, no accident that we have the epistemological standards we do."1 Still, whether we talk of meaning or not, our standards are anthropomorphic. And it is this that makes it possible for us to know that we're in such-and-such a country in normal circum- stances or that water boils if sufficiently heated or that there is a pen or a book. But if we know, these are facts, simple undeniable facts-so I am not defending a coherence theory of truth. Then again, there can be no testing here for being in accord with reality so this is not a correspondence theory either. Look at it this way. We can distinguish, roughly, between the facts and our attitudes towards or attempts to get at them-though these things are extremely closely related. Given that knowledge rests on anthro- pomorphic standards, so too do certainty, proof, argument and evidence. It is not clear that the connection in any of these cases is one of meaning. There is no reason at all for thinking the facts must, in general, have an anthropomorphic flavour to them. Nevertheless, knowledge implies truth. And if all these concepts are linked, directly or indirectly, to our epistemological standards, the sceptic is wrong. I am certain I have never been on the moon and it's true that there's still some daylight left. In fact, I'm n Wittgenstein is sometimes nervous about the idea that grammar or what is philosophically significant might not be exhausted by matters of meaning or, at least, of 'meaning'. And he tries the 'meaning move', not only with 'knowledge', but also with 'argument', 'mistake', 'judgment', 'reasonability' and so on. It is rejected-convincingly, it seems to me, and along with most other standard responses to the sceptic-by Keith Lehrer in 'Why Not Scepticism?', Philosophical Forum, 1971, reprinted in Essays on Knowledge and Justification (ed. Pappas and Swain), Cornell, 1978. Reasons, at least, and of a compelling kind are needed here-just as they are for the view that the sceptic does not make sense or that the lan- guage-game is somehow sacrosanct. Stroud too is very good on the implausibility of the grounds usually offered for not embracing scepti- cism and in the negative, critical, part of his book he proceeds, quite rightly, as though we ought to be able to tackle the extremely powerful considerations in favour of being a sceptic head-on. 203</page><page sequence="14">Brian Grant absolutely certain-though other, more artificial, notions of absolute certainty and of complete justification, say, can be described.12 So while the coherence theory should be rejected since it is by itself an open invitation to scepticism, we do rely on our evidence and our justifications in pursuit of our epistemological aims. And while a correspondence theory can't be checked for the paradigms and is acceptable elsewhere only if it's too casual or trite to amount to a theory, we do often know the truth. Sometimes we're absolutely certain of the absolute truth. What Wittgenstein forces us to recognize is that a proper understanding of this certainty requires 'a step like the one taken in relativity theory' and the courage to ask if God 'is bound by our knowledge'. The courage to ask. But how should we answer? And what gives us the right, in defiance of the claims of scepticism, to employ anthropomorphic standards for knowledge? There is a soft spot in Wittgenstein's thinking at this point-and a number of smaller questions. Couldn't some of our paradigms just conceivably be wrong? Mightn't we add new ones? And Wittgenstein does make use of a puzzlingly broad range of examples. Aren't there paradigms of different sorts? Aren't some more certain than others? Indeed, we are hardly more certain of some of them than of some hypotheses. Wittgenstein would agree with much of this and he goes as far as suggesting-non-epistemologically, it seems to me, or else dan- gerously if not inconsistently-that the paradigms might be said to depend on what surrounds them. And perhaps they can be insulated from one another to some extent. Not without reserva- tions, however, from the most natural or irresistible comparisons. So are there paradigms of any sort in some areas? My knowledge of your mind is so minimal and so problematic compared to my knowledge of mine. I do know some people better than others. 12 Like those suggested by Peter Unger-who is, as far as I know, the only sceptic in print who makes no bones about it at all-in Ignorance, Oxford, 1965. Such accounts of absolute certainty should not be con- fused with the 'absolute conception of reality' described by Williams in Descartes: The Project of Pure Enquiry, Harvester, 1978. That has to do with the fact or reality side of the fence. It seems required for knowledge, according to Williams, but he thinks of it, in its comprehensiveness, as analogous to Nagel's 'view from nowhere'-for which see The View from Nowhere, Oxford, 1986. It is then unattainable by anyone but God. There is, though, no reason why we shouldn't split it up into bits. And Wittgenstein's paradigms, I will argue, are indeed bits or elements of the absolute conception of reality. I mean: They're facts or they're absolutely true. What more could you ask? 204</page><page sequence="15">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise But how much does any of us know in the end of the details of what goes on in another's mind? And how much do we really know of the future beyond next week compared to the fairly dis- tant past? I am not saying we should be sceptical about these areas. The question is simply that of whether they are autonomous enough to contain their own paradigms . And how do we count areas anyway and won't some of them-though they might, of course, be suspect-compete with others? Astrology with religion, for example, and both with science. But then, it seems to me, some of Wittgenstein's paradigms couldn't be false. No illusion could be that perfect, I think, when I look at my hand, whereas I could indeed forget where I live-not easily but relatively so. Wittgenstein's inclination here is to emphasize that the system stands or falls as a system, as a whole. This does allow for a few of our paradigms to be offered up to the sceptic or kept as hostages. Whether we need to do this depends in part on the list we pick in the first place. Still, to say no more is to concede too much to the sceptic-or it is with regard to some paradigms. I know that this is a hand.13 But, you might say, I am only human. Then take a different paradigm. I know this is the word 'and'. So do you. You can see it as I do. There it is on the page. Of that we are certain. Or take where you are right now. In some room or on a deck perhaps, sit- ting in a chair or on the floor or lying down. Consider your sur- roundings. It's bright or it's warm, there's a door or some trees or your glass. Of these things you are certain. Or take the certainty that 2 + 3 = 5 or 12 x 12 = 144 or that human beings are mostly male or female or the certainty that we exist. There is an obvious worry here. Wittgenstein doesn't face up to it, not squarely or resolutely enough. But before continuing, I want to stress that what we already have are most of the elements of a successful defence against scepticism. With apologies to the metaphors and similes that Wittgenstein himself employs, the paradigms are, for him, like a loosely connected network of pil- ings floating at various depths. There are an indefinite number of them but none with the epistemological status favoured by the tradition for they all float in the water. This just does have a 13 For Wittgenstein, by contrast: 'A totality of judgments is made plau- sible to us'.-On Certainty, #140; 'What I hold fast to is not one proposi- tion but a nest of propositions'.-#225; and 'Experience can be said to teach us these propositions. However, it does not teach us them in isola- tion: rather, it teaches us a host of interdependent propositions. If they were isolated I might perhaps doubt them'.-#274. 205</page><page sequence="16">Brian Grant much more realistic, much less invented, ring to it as a descrip- tion of our everyday practices than any form of Foundationalism. And it is a more plastic and a more suggestive view-although you can, if you like, regard Wittgenstein as a Foundationalist of a very unorthodox sort. The unanswered questions about other minds, the future and counting areas? They are unanswered because they are unanswerable. No unequivocal answer, at any rate, is possible. And we can, in the light of all this and in the same sort of spirit, make sense of the undeniable fact that we have different standards for different contexts and candidates for knowledge-the laboratory or the law court as opposed to the street corner, the expert or the bearer of surprising or unpleasant news as opposed to the amateur or child or the remarker on the uninteresting or banal. And while Wittgenstein does sometimes concede too much to the sceptic, there is, I think, a concession to be made. Both Descartes and Moore, in their different ways, were wrong about that. So now for the soft spot-and, finally, the tor- toise. The worry, quite simply, is this: Haven't we, in insisting on the paradigms, begged the sceptic's question? Don't we beg it and fre- quently every day of our lives? For those of us who feel the need to respond to the sceptic, his position sometimes seems to be the only honest one around. The arguments for it are such impressive arguments. We ought to be equally honest in our response. There is, I think, a sense in which we have begged the sceptic's question. Are we entitled to? Let me remind you that the certainty that we are entitled to is the cer- tainty of our most basic paradigms. Wittgenstein is reluctant to put the issue in this direct confrontational way-and he is also too easy on his mavericks and strange tribes. For while he some- times adopts a firmer tone, he says of someone who rejects a basic paradigm of ours that he would be 'different', indeed 'radically different'. He also says he would be 'intellectually very distant' from us. Such responses are nowhere near good enough. Many of us feel like that about sociologists and undertakers. Wittgenstein's notion of normal circumstances does have to be presupposed here-and these circumstances can't be 'precisely described'. But he should have seen more clearly or more consis- tently that one must hammer away, again and again, at the absolute certainty that attaches to many of our paradigms, both as parts of a system and also and even when they are considered in isolation. This makes one out to be, not a fraud or a liar, but something like an advertising copy-writer or a preacher maybe. We must, as philosophers, extol the virtues of our epistemologi- 206</page><page sequence="17">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise cal equipment. We will beg the sceptic's question in a sense but advertising is not always dishonest and preachers can be ingenu- ous and positively right-minded.14 Advertising? Think of this. The human brain is extremely com- plex and immensely clever. While the development of the comput- er and the birth of A.I. as a discipline have opened up staggering prospects, we have a lot to do to catch up with the brain. In the speed of its reactions and the range of its functions, it sometimes defeats our imagination. The brain is a fantastic invention. I didn't write that. It's not my style, at any rate. It came, or might have come, from the publisher's blurb on one of those slick new books by a brain-scientist or a believer in A.I. Or think of this. When compared to the mind of an ape, the human mind is infinitely lucid, infinitely subtle. Man is the crowning achieve- ment of his own blind indomitable will and a mosaic of laws all working together or against one another. These laws are difficult to grasp but man has fought for his survival. He has arisen by accident and necessity out of the primitive macro-biotic soup and exploded like a star across the heavens. I didn't write that either. It might well have come from the introductory chapter of some- thing by a biologist or, let's say, an evolutionist with a much broader sweep or canvas. Or think of this. Physics is one of the hard sciences. Here the mind grapples with the most fundamental secrets of reality, the forces that control our destiny and make our existence possible. The world out there can be stark or inhos- pitable. Trying to come to terms with it requires an intelligence out of the ordinary and a tough resilient make-up. The physicist operates at the far-flung edges of the universe, at the constantly changing limits of human thought and understanding. But where did scientific speculation start? That from the lead-in to a docu- mentary on the history of science or a book on the applications of 14 Doesn't Wittgenstein's failure to insist on the paradigms or insist enough give everything back to the sceptic? Even here there are clues. Sometimes he does insist-as with the following by now anachronistic example: 'We all believe that it isn't possible to get to the moon; but there might be people who believe that that is possible and that it some- times happens. We say; these people do not know a lot that we know. And, let them be never so sure of their belief-they are wrong and we know it'.-On Certainty, #286. He also says: 'Knowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement'.-#378. I don't profess to know what Wittgenstein means by that difficult word but what I say in the rest of this paper is one more or less plausible account. And then there is the fas- cination with Moore's obviously and flatly question-begging response to scepticism. Stroud too devotes a fair amount of space to Moore. What is needed, however, is to turn question-begging into an art. 207</page><page sequence="18">Brian Grant mathematics perhaps-and even writers on economics or the intricacies of chess can sound rather like this. So there's your advertising and there's a lot more where it came from. It isn't mine. But it is familiar-and it can't be dismissed. For it's all true in a way. The human mind is a marvellous instru- ment. And given this truth, we need not fear scepticism-the view that all of this is just so much talk. It isn't. The human mind knocks chimpanzees and the best of our hardware into a cocked hat. You might not want to dignify this sort of remark with the word 'true'. I should point out that remarks of this sort can be false or misguided or off-target. If someone used any of the descriptions I have employed in connection with competent adult human beings to refer instead to a dog or a case of severe retarda- tion, his comments would be completely unacceptable. Then there are remarks of this sort but of the other kind-those that are sensible, right, accurate, just. Such remarks can, it seems to me, be said to be true. If I have managed to persuade you of this, there must be a sense in which I have not begged the sceptic's question. For how could I persuade you of anything by begging the question? There are two distinct faces to advertising even though they can be made to dis- solve-on the screen, in a magazine or a paper on philosophy- into one. We can express the sceptic's complaint as follows: It is a simple fact that there could be creatures with epistemological abil- ities superior to ours-far superior or immeasurably so; it is anoth- er simple fact that we can imagine counter-possibilities to our most basic items of knowledge that these creatures could directly address although we can't; we do, however, take seriously counter- possibilities to our knowledge claims that we can address; they are all, equally, counter-possibilities; why on earth do we-there is a real question as to whether we should-attach such profound sig- nificance to-or, better, behave so opportunistically at-the roughly specifiable level at which our epistemological abilities fail us? I haven't begged the sceptic's question. I haven't replied 'There isn't either' and left it at that. And what I have said beyond that, of a surely fair, right and reasonable kind, is the content or measure of my not having begged the question. So much more can be done here than Wittgenstein's brute 'conversion' or 'rejection of an idea' suggests. I have begged the sceptic's question. We wouldn't allow ourselves the luxury of ignoring all these counter- possibilities if we were smarter. We couldn't. Presumably or maybe a similar luxury but not that one. For this pitch I have made on our behalf, this case I have constructed in our favour, 208</page><page sequence="19">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise might strike the members of some superhuman species as nothing but propaganda-the human hard-sell, the complacent croaking of human frogs, the blind silly buzzing of bees. I warned you that the line would be fine, that question-begging is an art.'5 It is a neglected art but there are all sorts of kinds of begging the question-unacceptable or otherwise. One might beg one's own question. One might promise or undertake to answer a question and to do so argumentatively and yet assume in one's argument, explicitly or implicitly, blatantly or in effect, what one set out to prove. This is a bad kind-or it is if the circumstances aren't spe- cial. One might, on the other hand, beg someone else's question; one might, in one's argument, assume what someone else has com- mitted himself to prove. How bad a kind is this? It can't be too bad since we all do it every time we argue. And one might do it by giving a not exactly decisive or not really enough of an argument or, indeed, not much of one at all from a logician's point of view but use particularly striking or persuasive language. Or one might just exploit the lack of a sharp distinction between assertion and argument. Or be driven understandably crazy by someone who responds with 'Why?' to whatever one says. Or examine the ques- tion in enormous detail before deciding to beg it and then do so in a completely self-conscious clear-eyed way. Or carefully confine oneself to what is as plain as the nose on your face-or to what is sensible, right, just. Or beg it, as Hume suggests, merely because '5 Stroud discusses, in his brief positive comments, Thompson Clarke's distinction between 'internal' questions and the 'external' ques- tions of the sceptic and the idea that the latter can be shown to somehow bypass the former or even to be incoherent. The distinction seems to mean, for Stroud and Clarke: 'plain' as opposed to 'philosophical or scep- tical'. But the above simple facts are just plain simple facts. There is nothing particularly philosophical about them, nothing fancy or poten- tially corrupt-and there is certainly nothing sceptical, not when they are considered in themselves. Otherwise, Realism would, as is sometimes maintained, imply scepticism. This distinction of Stroud's and Clarke's, it should be noticed, differs from Jonathan Dancy's in An Introduction to Conemporary Epistemology, Blackwell, 1985. For Dancy, an 'internal' account of knowledge requires that we know that we know whereas an 'external' one does not. Dancy claims, unconvincingly, that his own response to the sceptic-we know without knowing of a crucial factor in virtue of which we know-is not externalist. I think there are external cases of knowledge in Dancy's sense. The sceptic need have no worries, though, if all we can say is that we believe we know. The regress that threatens in internal cases? The human mind is sophisticated enough to allow for a handful of levels but the regress peters out as our limitations set in. 209</page><page sequence="20">Brian Grant you have better things to do. Besides, begging someone else's question is not usually as bad as begging an urgent or important question. Most questions, after all, are neither. So it depends on the question. If the question is not very interesting, is easily answerable and could be answered, moreover, by the person doing the begging if he weren't so busy answering some other question, well, we might think, where's the harm? Suppose, however, that the question is as difficult to answer as it is fundamental and this because it would have to be begged by anyone attempting an answer. That would be a brutal question. But this is, it seems to me, one way of describing the sceptic's question. I want to argue for this by offering an analogy. The analogy is a specific instance of scepticism: scepticism with regard to reason-that under-discussed sort of scepticism defend- ed by Hume in the Treatise and mentioned more briefly by Descartes in the second half of Meditation I. Or consider global scepticism, the over-discussed or often glibly discussed sort that doubts everything or is sure of nothing. This sort need not be proposed, as philosophers often imagine, by someone who is fool- ish enough to say he knows it is right. It might simply be that he isn't sure it isn't right. Still, global scepticism does imply scepti- cism with regard to reason-expressed with some degree of con- viction or concern. Hume's worry is that one might reject scepti- cism with regard to reason on the grounds that it can't be argued for except self-defeatingly and think that is the end of the matter. Hume disapproves of this way of proceeding; he calls it 'the expe- ditious way'. It is not merely that this sort of scepticism still might be right even though it can't be legitimately argued for. It is, rather-as Hume struggles to remind us-that it can't be argued against except question-beggingly. This is not an addi- tional fact; it is the same fact in a different guise. But it isn't only argument that is at issue. Take fundamental canons or principles of argumentation; take, for example, the Law of Non- Contradiction, one of the more important things up for grabs if reason is questioned, and assume that it is indeed unavailable and quite generally. You couldn't say anything-anything at all on any topic. The noises your mouth made would have no content. They would, as it were, be compatible with the opposite noises for all anyone knew. Your attempted remark would not pick out any territory or make any contribution. It would not, therefore, be a remark. You would like to make a remark? You would like to say something? Go ahead-but you've got to beg the sceptic's question. You've got to talk, if only to yourself, and you've got to be able to think. I'm begging it too, you will have noticed. We've 210</page><page sequence="21">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise got to. I don't know whether to say we have a logical or a psycho- logical necessity here.'6 This is part of what I wanted to prove. The analogy, it should be emphasized, is just that, an analogy. Not every form of scepti- cism implies scepticism with regard to reason or global scepti- cism. The proposition established by the analogy is that you've got to beg some sceptical questions. The one suggested by it is that you've got to beg them all-though it won't always be as evi- dent at first sight. You've got to beg the question brought up by external world scepticism and, with an occasional gulp perhaps, scepticism about other minds and the future. One tries not to do it abruptly or uncouthly. If someone points to a question and says 'It's open', it isn't polite or it is incredibly dense to say 'It's closed'. I have tried to keep things above board and I have tried to be one of the better question-beggers, one of the more scrupu- lous kind. It is, with the sceptic, the only tool we can philosophi- cally employ. How good is the proof as a whole, how good is the analogy? You know what I think. I think that the inevitability of being more or less begged if one ever raises it is the hallmark of a sceptical ques- tion. How does this connect with the sceptic's reliance on counter- possibilities we human beings can do nothing about? We can't- and this is a truism-gather evidence in order to argue against such counter-possibilities. We don't have the wits for it. So we have to beg that sort of question if we are ever going to give it an affirmative or anti-sceptical answer. That is what an absence of foundations means. It will be objected that an indirect argument might be avail- 16 A difficulty Wittgenstein runs into in certain contexts. Hume puts the point about arguments against scepticism with regard to reason being question-begging in temporal terms. First, scepticism holds sway in the mind, then the anti-sceptical or 'dogmatical' position, then scepticism . . . and so on. Fogelin too notices the relevance of Hume's discussion to Wittgenstein's project-although his interpretation of the issues is very different from mine. But he, like Hume, puts the point temporally-see pp. 228-9. Hume does say, however, that 'the sceptical and dogmatical reasons are of the same kind'. Hume has, it seems to me, no equal in his understanding of the strength of sceptical arguments. Neither should it be supposed that he was entirely happy with his arguments for scepticism- and not just because of the alleged brute psychological impossibility of endorsing them. There are a number of attempts to undermine scepticism in the Treatise although none of them, it must be admitted, is very successful. Still, Hume did appreci- ate-much more fully than Descartes, for example-the paradox as well as the power of scepticism. 211</page><page sequence="22">Brian Grant able to us-even, Heaven help us, a transcendental argument- where some other fact is presented as requiring that we know what the sceptic doubts. This obviously won't work. Unless an argument, a direct and specific one, rules out the sceptic's counter-possibility, endorsing this other fact or alleged fact will beg the sceptic's question. And, again, any argument, indirect, transcendental or whatever will, as will the understanding of even the baldest and least complicated of assertions, necessarily rely on reason. I said this is one way of describing the sceptic's question. For we can, once again, offer a different assessment. We can, impressed by just how unacceptable question-begging can be at its most irritatingly dismissive or self-satisfied, say I have not begged the sceptic's question-not obviously or in any deplorable fashion. We've been fair enough to the sceptic. I think we owe that to our- selves.17 But then there is, of course or again, the other side to the story. Science-fiction novels about the future of science can be especial- ly riveting with scientists as high-priests of culture, counselling, protecting and leading humanity into galactic battles against terri- ble dragons and the demons of evil and ignorance. And even con- temporary physicists can be self-indulgent if not sloppy-minded. Do you know what goes on in physics these days? Quarks and charm and black holes, the big bang as a book-end in time and alternative universes and still, sometimes, tachyons. They can be embarrassing, these physicists of ours-and romantic besides with often a touch of scepticism. Romanticism, remember, used to be a school of philosophy. And remember those games we play with ourselves about complete epistemological security: If I were God and thought that such-and-such was true, it would have to 17 We all know that the only position to adopt is to be anti- Foundational, Realist about the physical world and anti-sceptical all at once; otherwise, we sound naive, mannered or outrageous. I know of no other sort of account than the above that would reconcile these views. In particular, it should be emphasized that recent discussions of closure don't help here, or not by themselves. See Nozick's Philosophical Explanations, Harvard, 1981, for some of the details. The critical point for closure or its absence is at the limit of our abilities. And unless sense can be made of that, unless it can be justified in some way or defended, the notion of closure poses no problem for the sceptic. Besides, there is nothing to prevent us, after we have vindicated the paradigms, from say- ing it follows, as it certainly seems to, that we know we're not dreaming, that an evil genius isn't deceiving us, that we're not brains in vats-and so on. Closure? 212</page><page sequence="23">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise be true? The sceptic has a vision of an austere but epistemologi- cally perfect universe. The details of this vision are difficult to fill in. What would God want with evidence? And perhaps He wouldn't need a notion of knowledge at all. Because it's a vision, its opposite, I suppose, is also a vision. Its opposite is just this, this idea of a human being with his or her considerable abilities and accomplishments as an epistemological starting point. For at another, much more basic, level than conjectures about quarks and black holes there is, for example-child's play, by contrast- the certainty that here is a hand. Our concept of knowledge, or our employment of it, requires this certainty, this acceptance or acknowledgment. As visions go, this is a clear and a plain one. It is, to be sure, a human vision. Not romantic so much as commit- ted or engaged. It is what our anti-scepticism amounts to. It is- and this is what is hard to get straight about-the only form it can take.18 The scientist, as I've been saying, is often a bit of a sceptic. He knows how inscrutable reality can be so he talks, often, about nothing ever being certain and the simplicity of a theory as opposed to its truth. Wittgenstein talks of simplicity in one or two passages as well. Why can't the universe be complicated?, one wants to know. And there are incredible or frightening monsters out there, no question about it. There are Martians, actual or pos- sible, who see the world differently-and there is God. And of course we might add some new paradigms in the future and change some of our ways of thinking. But to put the point blunt- ly, if anyone thinks I've just eaten breakfast or that this paragraph is not written in English, he is wrong. God is bound by our knowledge. He has to be if we know. Descartes expresses the same thought when he says 'the human mind has in it something that we may call divine'. This faith of ours in God or in humankind is what our turning our backs on our doubts consists of. This faith or vision or this embracing of 'human authority' and the 'human language-game' is, once again, our only possible 18 Romanticism is given a central place in that most romantic of books, Stanley Cavell's The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality and Tragedy, Oxford, 1979-and in the discussion of scepti- cism, in particular. It is hardly central for me. And there is not much else that Cavell's treatment of scepticism has in common with mine. What I have said is also reminiscent-in some ways and vaguely at least-of certain Phenomenologists and Existentialists. Merleau-Ponty is perhaps the best of them on the topic of scepticism. But I hope I have put things more straightforwardly and, so to speak, more analytically than he ever does. 213</page><page sequence="24">Brian Grant defence against scepticism. It is, therefore, the solution to our sceptical problems.'9 So-we have a lack of foundations. And there is a concession to the sceptic in this account, a relativity or a kind of conventional- ism, and, for some, a hint of anti-Realism. But I think this last term should be reserved for the view that reality itself has a human stamp or cast or twist. Even Ptolemy had fewer pretensions. What we do have the right to say is much more modest. It is that our epistemological situation could have been a whole lot worse than it is. Then again, it could have been a whole lot better. I have argued, however, that this conventionalism or relativity can be buttressed by a pretty robust Realism. Our epistemological para- digms are our windows to the world. And once we have realized this, we can retrieve all sorts of non-paradigmatic cases and regard those too as cases of knowledge. We can also allow that our episte- mological standards might well be more relaxed in some circum- stances than in others-and for children and maybe animals. But our basic human paradigms are the key. Without an adequate account there, none of these other moves would be at all convinc- ing. Part of the one about relaxed standards is, I suppose, Wittgenstein's analogy with children and squirrels but the other way round. Still, Wittgenstein's analogy, in the direction he intended it, doesn't get us very far in our opposition to the sceptic. The point of it is to stress the frequently or largely non-cognitive nature of our basic epistemological procedures. I have no quarrel with that. The man in the street or the non-philosopher has to be protected here. He is under no obligation to offer or to be able to offer, in support of his knowledge claims, a defence against scepti- cism. Even so, a philosophical defence of our ordinary claims and procedures had better not be inarticulate or arational.20 And this despite the fact that we find ourselves in a peculiar position as far as scepticism is concerned. I think Wittgenstein is 19 Descartes's remark can be found in Rules for the Direction of the Mind, Vol. I, p. 10. Wittgenstein might seem to claim that God is bound by our knowledge. But the irony should be clear: '.. . as soon as I say this sentence ["I know that I am now sitting in a chair"] outside its context, it appears in a false light. For then it is as if I wanted to insist that there are things that I know. God himself can't say anything to me about them'.-On Certainty, #554. 20 I should emphasize that the above dismissive attitude towards anti- Realism has to do with physical reality, in particular. I take Nagel to have shown-in 'What is it Like to be a Bat?' Philosophical Review, 1974, reprinted in Mortal Questions, Cambridge, 1979-that we should indeed be anti-Realists, species by species, about mental reality. But what Nagel 214</page><page sequence="25">Wittgenstein's Elephant and Closet Tortoise right in suggesting that the place of argument in philosophy has been misunderstood and its importance overestimated. Some things don't need 'explaining'; they just do 'lie open to view' or are 'always before one's eyes'. Still, argument are often essential in philosophy as they are elsewhere-and those in this paper are, again, of various kinds. Some of them make use of the more respectable methods of advertising or the less reprehensible skills and techniques of a lawyer or a lobbyist. There is thus a sense in which they operate in a vacuum or beg the question. I have tried to provide an account of how and why this is in the end as tolera- ble a state of affairs as it is inevitable. Such an account, I believe, constitutes the tortoise required by Wittgenstein's elephant. A tor- toise of some sort is necessary. And tortoises are always peculiar. So why not the obvious one as we 'stand before the abyss', this acceptance, this straightforward and unblushing endorsement, this celebration, even, of our fallible but in many ways amazing human condition? Genuinely amazing. Nothing else remotely like it ever seen and sworn to in this corner of the universe. So step right up, folks-just watch out for the snake-oil.21 The University of Calgary 21 Our notion of knowledge or our employment of it is therefore such that while it comes with a sliding scale so the more intelligent you are, the more demanding it is or the less you are able to get away with, human beings do qualify as knowers-but don't listen to any stories about epis- temologically-gifted chickens or frogs. The notion makes a gesture towards the significance, in the grand scheme of things but for us in par- ticular, of that distinction. The above views about argument in philos- ophy are from the Investigations, #126 and #129; the remark about stand- ing before the abyss of scepticism is from On Certainty, #370. offers as a solution to the sceptical problem is no solution at all. I have the uncomfortable feeling of keeping a score-card or a log here. Nagel's sug- gestion, in The View .from Nowhere, is that 'the correct course is not to assign a victory to either [the objective or the subjective] standpoint but to hold the opposition clearly in one's mind without suppressing either ele- ment'. This is simply Hume's predicament with the label 'Correct' pasted over it. 215</page></plain_text>
