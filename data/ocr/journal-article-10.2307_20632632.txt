There is a good collection of work from three poets: Deirdre Brennan whose themes come from the natural world, performance poet M?ighread Medbh and Nuala Ni Chonch?ir's simplicity and mixing of the exotic with the local. Each diva shows a fine selection following a brief personal foreword.

Explained in an article in our October issue: 66 drawings in ink, chalk or pencil of the poor and street traders of eighteenth-century Dublin, with a colour self-portrait of the artist (it looks like pencil and watercolour) who lived 1740-1808 and made these studies when young. The album came to light in Australia last year. There is extensive discussion of the artist, his work and society of the time, and comparisons with similar contemporary work from other cities in illustrated essays by William Laffan, Joseph McDonnell, Sean Sheesgreen, Anne Crookshank and Desmond Fitzgerald as well as a detailed critical commentary on each drawing and on the binding etc. A big handsome sewn flapped paperback doing full justice to a most interesting find.

Dublin born Father Henry Flanagan (1918-1992) a self taught sculptor, worked in stone, many different kinds of wood, concrete and copper. This celebration of his life and work (following an exhibition of his smaller work last year) has a foreword by artist Martin Gale (whose revealing portrait of the man is reproduced), an appreciation by fellow Dominican Raymond O'Donovan and a critical essay by Brian Fallon. Music and his faith are reflected in the colour photographs of his work with additional close-up shots, and there are good photos of the man at work. Layout, reproductions and presswork do full justice to the work. There is a list of his exhibitions. *+ / /y Movers and Shapers: Irish art since 1960. Vera Ryan.

There is a brief biography of each with a photograph and the date of the interview. Topics flow well into another and cover many diverse aspects of the arts, culture and cultural politics. Though 'art' seems essentially to mean visual art here, there are sideswipes at theatre, film and dance?we couldn't find anything on literature. The cover design is arresting and very successful using the spot-varnishing technique. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Altar Boy: a story of life after abuse. Andrew Madden.

This book gives as typical, clear and honest an account of the effect of such abuse on a someones life as you are likely to get. Letters from high-ranking clergy are given and are worth study for their cool formality and trenchant authoritarian self-righteousness alongside the hollow-sounding apologies. The cover with its photo of the author aged twelve on his confirmation day is terribly touching. * - One Voice : my life in song. Christy Moore.

On recovering he went to Raris, where his friends included Modigliani and Joyce. He inherited Bellevue in 1930 and sold it in the 1940s which is where this account ends.

There is an account of the author's time as lighthouse-keeper around the Irish coast, with plenty of photographs of people in their daily island life, the school, pilots and lighthousemen, seamen and houses on the island?the chapter on the houses and that on the school are by respectively Fidel ma Mullane and Brid A. O'Mahony. There seems to be no reason why the wide format should have been chosen (no element uses the full width of the page), but it is pleasantly laid out.

The man from Comber, County Down, describes his days with the Irish Times, the Peace Train organisation and entering Seanad frreann alongside other public honours. Accounts of writers, politicians and celebrities along the way. He has cultivated a flair for buttonhol ing you and carrying you along with his story, and here does it again. We see him as an example of how Northern protestants and unionists can be likeable. Whether he does the same job among them in making Free Staters tolerable we don't know. + * Paper Tigers.

He traces f his family origins but more to the fore and to a his credit is the lucid account of the tides of a history. He writes with first-hand experience of ^ the IRB and the fall of Farnell, and has a special f remembrance of the patriot Kevin Barry whom he taught at the local school, while his recollections of Easter Week 1916. and the War of Independence are fresh and valuable. The illustrations, list of O'Toole's publications and index make this a valuable discovery, produced in the tradition of Jarlath Hayes by his daughter Susan Waine. &gt; * Yours Sincerely.

He was out i n the 1916 Rising and subsequently imprisoned, honorary iecretary of Sinn Fein, president of the IRB iupreme council and republican envoy in the JS, 1919-21. The major intrigues fully fleshed out?the split with Collins over the Treaty, their nutual passion for Kitty Kiernan and the /arious conflicting accounts of his shooting at he age of thirty-five in the Grand Hotel in skerries.

We weren't allowed to review the hardback (2001), being under a cloud at the time having failed to report something. It got good reviews elsewhere, but the paperback, though sewn and on decent paper, is in rather small type and the saving (we don't know the hardback price) might not be worthwhile. This is likely to remain the standard life, tracing the poet from his rustic Monaghan roots to his ociyssey into Dublin literary circles and beyond with London and America becoming part of the story.

In between is much analysis of the work alongside the quotidian and startling events that fed his art, as Foster in sleuth-like fashion attempts to unravel the man and the mystery as well as the many people that crossed his path.

Flynn's Tannery Restaurant is in Dungarvan, Co Waterford, and his dishes and ingredients are from all over the world. There are excellent colour photos of the food by Stuart Coughlan, and quite a lot of background text, mostly interesting enough and readable.

The author has made a series of films on Irish craftsmen at work, which seems to be often re-run on TV, and a first version of this book appeared in 1984. Somehow?quite unfairly?we expected a dutiful selection of stills in a rather dated book, and we were really gobsmacked by the freshness and sheer beauty of this totally revised and redesigned book, which covers fifty crafts under the headings textiles, stonework, woodwork, willow, leather, metalwork, ceramics, glassware, calligraphy and rural life. There are 621 fascinating, gleaming colour photographs that you will linger over and return to with pleasure. Justin Keating writes a foreword and various hands provide the text (including Kevin Danaher).

Notes at the end of each contribution and suggested further reading at the back. There is always the danger of over-analysing and stating the polysyllabic obvious or meaningless, as with Maud Ellmann telling us "Here Stephen attempts to motivate the arbitrary signs of language by attributing an onomatopoeic origin to 'suck'. Yet the memory of the drain in Wicklow [she means the Wicklow Hotel in Dublin!] actually sucks the meaning out of sucks."

The conclusions are alarming. The book is in the the 'twenty-first century Ireland' series, though the focus is worldwide and the water problems it describes are part of wider and deeper problems facing us all. +*- * EXPLORERS Seek The Frozen Lands: Irish polar explorers 1740-1922.

Tom Crean and Shackleton get plenty space as befits their achievements but there were others such as Crozier, captain of Terror, McClure, McClintock and Kellett, the private Arctic expeditions of Henry Gore-Booth, Jerome Collins and John Cole of Cork and of course Scott's expedition. Nugent, himself a polar explorer, as the ideal narrator. The designer has resorted to both a double-column layout and wide line-spacing, so the reading is easy.

Fifty-four songs from this area (bounded by Newry, Dundalk and Castleblaney, and taking in the Cooley peninsula) given in Gaelic and English, some with melody hand notated or in tonic sol-fa, all with notes on sources, singers, musicians, instruments, poets, collectors and places. Dance music and the social background aren't neglected, and the most immediately attractive feature of the book is the excellent photographs which are used on the text pages throughout, and (if it were needed!) bring the book to life. There are biographical listings for sixty-odd people in part 2, and in part 3 there are listings of collections, catalogues and their contents, and a hundred sample songs and tunes, again with contemporary notated melodies. There are then additional references and sources, abbreviations, a list of place-names and of the recordings. A major work of devotion, which will evoke devotion too.

Sarkisyanz from Armenia is looking forward to a Russian translation, the contents list proved too hot for Der Spiegel and Heidelberg University, where the lectures were delivered, did not admit to their existence. Angela Clifford of Athol refers to the English translation coming about through an advertisement in Books Ireland?hence she is co-translator along with the author. The thesis extends to finding proto-Nazism in British Fascism, French racism and Hitler's perception of himself as 'England's rejected lover' who had hoped to be an ally of the empire.

A chronology providing snippety summaries of great happenings for I each year (or decade or century!) from 8000 BC to AD 2002 (ten millennia: not bad). Every so often the calendar entries are interrupted by a two-page piece (nine of them) on for instance the Boyne Valley Cromwell, and the Troubles. There are colour illustrations and maps throughout, not just to sugar the pill, but often to inform or explain, for instance we have never seen the famine mortality as clearly expressed as on the map here. Perhaps mainly for schoolchildren, this is in fact an attractive and useful reference work, since the index allows you to look up an event, place or name.

On the critical success of At Swim-Two-Birds its author took to newspaper columnising that years later found a new audience far beyond the Irish Times. The Keats and Chapman pieces are a rather silly game in which O'Brien sets himself to create some nonsensical story involving the two men and a pun on a word or expression?for instance there's a farrago about Keats giving a local anaesthetic to animals in the zoo and explaining to Chapman that "there's safety in numb bears". Because of O'Nolan's or { O'Brien's or Na Gopaleen's fame as satirist, novelist and playwright, these are now treasured by his fans. Intrinsically as literature they are just samples of how someone who can write English (rare these days!) can get away with rubbish. Jamie O'Neill's introduction sets the pieces in their context while Eamon Morrissey's successful one-man show The Brother, based on the writings of O'Brien, brings up the rear. * &lt; -* * / CEE?

Plenty of laments, ballads on natural disasters, elegies, lampoons, speculations in theology, plus bawdy, angry, gentle and mad poems and of course love songs. This is essentially a scholarly and very well annotated collection (and a remarkably extensive one), but it also affords rich, entertaining and interesting reading for anyone who would like to widen his horizons.

Harty is only one of many musicians?classical, romantic, moderns, operatic, popular, traditional?who inspired Rattan's inimitable posters, cartoons, magazine and programme covers etc. which are reproduced here in unstinting profusion and colour with background notes. There is a tradition of amateur caricaturing that dates from the late nineteenth century to which Patton's work belongs, though the kindest meaning is to be attached to 'amateur' in his case, for he would beat many professionals in draughtsmanship, imagination, lettering and typography, and his wit is immense, delightful and always kind. He scores off composers, audiences and musicians but beyond that there are added jokes that require no more specialist knowledge than the average music lover commands. David Byers and Mike Catto contribute pices on Ratton (b. 1948) who writes a preface about the poster as fun and the sounding board of memory as well as herald of musical event?and an end-note about printing them.

Blackstaff (Smithsonian Institute in USA). 352 pp+ 16 of colour ?20 hb 24 cm 0-85640-744-5. Maybe the Smithsonian is in the habit of commissioning books called by the names of countries, but it does seem a little sollipsist so to name a book about the natural history of an island which is no less a physical, geological, historical, cultural, social, political, artistic and so forth entity. Actually Viney does discuss climate and geology. He takes the reader on a grand tour to discover the life on the island and in its waters as well as habitats. He goes for quantity rather than size with the colour photographs in the 16-page 'art' section; elsewhere in this column we argue that colour printing has now been long enough established and might move out of such ghettos, but reproduction of some of the black-and-white photos ih the text pages (printed in the USA) would make you wonder whether mono chrome printing has been around long enough; even Books Ireland?printed on a similar matt paper?boasts better halftones than these as a matter of course. Protection and conservation are Viney's final burden in this enchanting exploration. Source for each chapter and a list of nature reserves at the back.

Such titles as 'The Bloody Thoughts of a Butcher's Apron', 'Art Students Descending a Staircase' and 'Backstage with the Pantomime Horse's Rear End'. Bradshaw is yet another poetry publisher content to put short-line poems on the far left side of the page. Sloppiness and laziness can be the only reason?or are book publishers and poets blind to even the most elementary qualities of a pleasant page? ** / * / From 'The Life of The Count of Zagoba'. Philip Quaite. Lapwing. 40 pp NPG pb21 cm 1-898472-78-5. Tending to the psychedelic using South East Antrim turns of phrase and while Quaite?good name for a poet? is said to eschew Victorian verse, he has some hankerings for his own Mauds and gardens as in, 'When the birds sing just before dawn' but otherwise might well smoke a long fag or two with Maestro Bukowski. + / Naomhoga na Laoi.

Deeply meditative pieces. &lt; / * / September Elegies. Mary O'Donnell. Lapwing. 64 pp npg pb 21 cm 1-898472-77-7. Many of them originally published in periodicals, and alongside the elegies are poems under Hauntings and Antidotes. Plenty to choose from in this serious contemplation of serious themes. * / * Serious Angel. Jan Twardowski. Dedalus. 32 pp 10 ?7.95 brochure 21 cm 1-904556-17-5 (limited edn of 350 copies, but no number or identifier: see remarks under God in France above). Selection of English translations from 'Poland's best loved poet', born 1915, whose work reflects his faith with mention of Thomas Merton, Saint Theresa and his famous poem 'Explanation' from which one line, "I will not pour holy theology into your ears with a teaspoon". Translations by Sarah Lawson and Matgorzata Koraszewska. Lawson writes a brief introduction. ? s * / Teen Spies. Jane Yeh. Metre Editions. 32 pp 7 pb 22 cm 0-9545685-1-3 (again the dubious claim to be a limited edition of 200 copies, but no number etc.) First collection from American poet winner of TLS Blackwells poetry competition. She manages to look at life through her own original wit, making a welcome change from agony, angst and pain transformed into poems. The titles are in a jolly calligraphic italic with swash letters used correctly (for once!); otherwise uniform with Cod in France above. * -i / / What Darkness Covers. Tony Curtis. Arc Publications. 88 pp ?8.95 pb 22 cm 1-900072 53-X. Fifth collection with twelve poems after paintings by Lucien Freud, remedies for the broken hearted, melancholia, hangover and loneliness and other individual pieces. Spare, and fond of Beckett. The English publishers' design is very comparable with, for instance, that of Dedalus here. &lt; / / Brown Morning. Franck Pavloff. O'Brien Press. 32 pp 4.95 ?3.50 pb 20 cm 0-86278 838-2. Includes the original 1998 French version, Matin Brun, at the back. It was originally published for a conference on fascism in 1998 and became a bestseller malgre-lui. An allegorical tale about extreme totalitarianism where brown animals become the superior species and the others begin to disappear. Psychologist Pavloff has written books for adults and children. Though this might seem to be for the latter, we think it's just for people. Design is peculiar. ? * y An Angel a Day : the daily magic and inspiration of angels. Margaret IMeylon. Element. 416 pp ?7.99 pb 16 x 14 cm 0-00 716513-7. Guide to invoking angelic magic in your life for spiritual enlightenment. Angel wisdom, rituals and meditations with recipes and various ancillary quotations add to the supernatural input, with one piece per day of the year. There is also astrological information. The author lives in Ireland and 'holds angel workshops', where presumably the winged workshoppers learn to believe in human beans :-&gt; y Apocalyptic and Eschatological Heritage: the middle east and Celtic realms, ed. Martin McNamara. Four Courts. 192 pp 65 ?75 hb 24 cm 1-85182-632-7.

With general introduction and one for each book, plus commentary. Running parallel on each page are the RSV and New Vulgate versions (the latter very small), with explanatory commentary between them. As with the other books, a handsome cloth case, and an attractive jacket, in this case an early medieval illustration of King David and his musicians. + j Saving Christianity: new thinking for old beliefs. Hilary Wakeman. Liffey Press. 184 pp 14.95 pb 24 cm 1-904148-32-8. Rector of a Church of Ireland parish in Cork and one of the first women to be ordained discusses the crisis of faith, and the falling numbers of the devout, with pointers for orthodox and dogmatic Christian churches. New ways to express eternal truths are explored, and religious belief in the light of new understandings of the human brain. A provocative and very interesting and persuasive text?and quite an inviting one: not too dense and in a decent size of type, and perhaps putting into words what many Christians are thinking and not daring to say?with a foreword by Bishop Willie Walsh. + ^ * HiHlUHUU The Stealing Steps. John Arden. Methuen. 319 pp ?16.99 hb 24 cm 0-413-77333-7. PEN Award-winning novelist for Cogs Tyrannic, who lives in Galway with his requent playwright collaborator {and wife) Margaretta D'Arcy: nine stories moving from fourteenth-century Yorkshire to Sheridan's London theatre times and modern Ireland among failed artists, poets and writers on the margins. Hieronymus Bosch illustrates the front jacket, and it's a nice big old-style cased book if at a rather fancy new-style price. Prepare to be enchanted and mesmerised. / * The Cities of Belfast, ed. Nicholas Allen and Aaron Kelly. Four Courts. 252 pp + 76 of colour photos 24,95 ?19.95 pb 24 cm 7 -85182 . 785-4; 50 ?39.95 hb -771-4. Fifteen pieces from emerging and established writers including the editors, Terence Brown, Gerald Dawe, Tom Fbulin, Catherine Morris, Nini Rodgers and Suzanna Chan on a wide range of topics and aspects of the North's noble capital including geologies of site and settlement, Belfast and world war two, the drama of Stewart Parker, the poetry of Ciaran Carson, visual artists Aisling O'Beirn, Sandra Johnston, Mary Mclntyre and Susan MacWilliam with samples of their work reproduced in monochrome, while John Duncan's series of colour photographs from Boom town are gritty urban realism devoid of people. Each of the latter takes an undeserved half-page with white spaces above and below, so they could have used eight instead of sixteen pages. An odd and rather challenging collection edited by two Eng. lit. academics. I / * / Ceann Tire / Earraghaidheal: a&gt; gComharsanaigh Gaelacha. P?draig ? Baoighill. Cotsceim. 522 pp 15 pb 21 cm.

Coford, Belfield, Dublin 4. 269 pp 30 hb 25 cm 1-902696-27-1. The operations manager of the National Council for Forest Research and Development presents pieces by senior Coiflte people on economic and environmental aspects of planning, site productivity, and general and specific guidelines to species selection and planting, together with detailed notes on some sixty species, with glossary, bibliography, list of common and botanical names, pests and diseases, and notes on soil and foliar sampling. Colours are used both for the copious illustrations and to clarify the text and tables, but the distribution map at the front is difficult because they use yellow (hard to see especially in tungsten light) to show mixed woodland, and there's so little broadleaf woodland (except in North Clare?) that the dusting of green spots are hard to see too. A labour of love by many hands. Very heavy for its size: over 900 grams. We are sure this was printed in Ireland, but like so many publishers Coford are happy to break the law that requires (we think) an imprint &gt; * / Practical Treatise on Trees. Samuel Hayes New Island. 232 pp 30 hb 20 cm 1-902602 94-3. Facsimile of a 1794 book. Foreword by chairman of the present-day Irish Tree Society Thomas Rakenham in which he discusses the life of Hayes (1743-95) who believed it his patriotic duty to plant trees and may have done the original drawings. This is a little gem with a folding illustration amongst the others, the long s (fimilar to an F), lengthy but wonderful footnotes and other period touches along with Hayes's delicate adoration of things arboreal m Wicklow, Avondale in particular, Dublin and</page><page sequence="9">BOOKS IRELAND 2003 November 291 beyond. Rakenham believes that Hayes planted j two silver firs beside the Avon. We were going to demur a little about adapting the old engraved title page to accommodate the new publisher's name, but then admiringly and gratefully found they had provided the old one as well. A fine little book and a good gift idea for the silviphile. I *&gt;** A Girl Called Blue. Marita Conlon-McKenna. O'Brien Press. 206pp 9.99 ?6.99 pb 22 cm 0- 86278-850-1. Bestselling Conlon-McKenna has written about the plight of the orphan for adults and here is the same theme for young adults. Blue O'Malley in 1960s institutional care (never the safest environment for any child) along with her friends Mary, Jessie, Molly and Lil suffer excessive hardship and are out to work making rosary beads under the aloof and strict nuns. Blue, a bit of a rebel, is determined despite punishment to find out what lies hidden in locked filed about her origins... Ice Man: the remarkable adventures of Antarctic explorer Tom Crean.

Smith is the biographer of Crean and of explorer Captain Oates and this adaptation for younger readers begins with Crean running away at fifteen and lying about his age to get into the British navy. The true story with pencil illustrations by Annie Brady and maps is given its full breath and scope along with a timeline of the hero's life, useful information and further reading. Not big type, but very short paragraphs with extra space between them. *-**/ Mysti: a teenage fairytale (Episode 1). C. A. Budgen and John Hales. Imagineire, 3300 Lake Drive, Gtywest, Dublin 24. 98 pp ?5.99 pb 22 cm 1-904725-00-7. Recommended for 'girls only' of 12 plus, a lavishly coloured comic book story about a a talented outgoing fairy who breaks the fairy code, transforms herself into a human and befriends rebellious Ella. The story does not shy away from drugs and bullying. Rumour has it that Mysti might transfer to the big screen, but we somehow guess this is part of I magi nei re's publicity tactics. Some nice touches of humour. * -* ** / Stereotype. Claire Hennessy. Poolbeg. 192 pp 6.50 pb 20 cm 1-84223-165-0. Fourth outing in fiction from final-year Loreto student in Dublin. Abigail Evans is a misfit who is happy about her non-conforming status, buying 'stuff she doesn't need, and sometimes cutting her i arms with razor blades if she feels 'blah'.

Comic-booky illustrations by Derry Dillon for this askew chap named Bob whose world in not so much upside down as all over the place and he talks backwards. Imagine how he sets to work in his new job at the zoo or should that be eht ooz? Very big type, in the Goldcrest series. * Back up the Beanstalk. Derek Keilty. Children's Press. 64 pp 5.50 pb 20 cm 1-901737-45-4. Terry Myler at her most grotesque?but still human and good humoured?illustrates a story aimed very much as the same readership (or listenership) as for Back-to-Front Bob above, but with twice as many pages. It's one of the 'Chimp' series, introducing the giant's four sons, Fe, Fi, Fo and Fum who take advantage of Jack's mother's decision to go into beanstalks wholesale. Good fun. See also Flash Fox below, another in the series. * y Curse in Reverse. Tom Coppinger, illustrated by Dirk Zimmer. Atheneum Books, New York. 32 pp 13.99 $16.95 Can$26.50 hb 25 x 23 cm 0-689-83096-3. Zimmer's colourful and amusing illustrations are we think exactly what children of any age will latch on to, and the story about a witch's curse that turns out to be quite the opposite is nice, fun and happy. The author live in Kildare and this is his first picture book. -&gt; y Flash Fox and Bono Bear. Tessa Moore. The Children's Press. 64 pp NPG pb 20 cm 1-901737-43-8. Bertie the bear gets himself an earring and changes his name to Bono in the hope of fame as a pop star but meanwhile he has to wrestle with Flash Fox who wants to run the corner shop ('Good wages for the right bear'). As always, illustrator Terry Myler hits the exact spot. We don't think there's a book she couldn't improve! * - * ; The Great Trolley Race. Lorraine Francis.

Ambitious (and very successful) illustrations in colour by Jean Texier. The book is sponsored by Bord G?is, and one wonders did they commission a story about a 'friendly blue flame' or did it happen first and then find such an apt sponsor? Will we get books about characters eating particular makes of ice cream, wearing particular trainers and drinking particular fizzy drinks? P?ga's Wonderland is a theme park scheduled to open at Goffs in Kildare in 2004, the brainchild of actor Bryan Murray and producer Kathleen Lambe, we're told. * - y Riverside : the curse. Peter Regan. The Children's Press. 128 pp 5.99 pb 20 cm 1-901737-46-2.
