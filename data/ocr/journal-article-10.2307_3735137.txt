<plain_text><page sequence="1">MLR, 89.3, I994 7I5 Harwood's aim, to demonstrate a systematic philosophical and psychological foundation in the poem, is to be respected but he sometimes looks like a man measuring the mist on Malvern Hills. In his discussion of the third vision, for example, he compartmentalizes Will's allegorical mentors and pins a precise label on each. Thought represents the rational soul in its abstractive and divisive modes, the highest intellectual faculty short of intelligentia: thus he misleads Will by producing the abstraction Dowel and dividing it into the positive, comparative, and superlative terms. The precision of Harwood's definition may similarly allure but mislead the reader: perhaps Thought does not represent one mental activity whose limitations are easily understood but, more blurrily, all Will's thinking for 'seuen yeer' (B VIII. 75) in all its obsession, complexity, illuminations, and misdirections. Perhaps Will is released from the labyrinth of his own mind by Imaginatif not because this character personifies 'the faculty for making similitudes' (p. 85) (metaphors, as Harwood admits, 'run all through Piers, of course' (p. 86)) but because he leads Will out of his own mental processes into the vision of Kynde. Similarly Study, despite her account of her various achievements (for example, 'Plato the poete, I putte hym first to boke' (Bx. 175-81)), is reduced to the lectio divina and discussed in terms of orality rather than literacy, while Clergy becomes the understanding and exegesis ofallegoria. There is much of interest in this account but it cuts Piers down to a smaller, if clearer, poem. KING'S COLLEGE LONDON PRISCILLA MARTIN Seeing the 'Gawain'-Poet: Description and the Act of Perception. By SARAH STANBURY. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. 1992. x + I55pp. ?22.95. In this lucid and engaging examination of the four poems of British Library, Cotton MSS, Nero AX, Pearl, Purity (Cleanness), Patience, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sarah Stanbury concentrates on a crucial aspect of these texts: the way they use description as part of their evaluative processes and more particularly how, through description, they approach the problem of determining the significances and interrelation of sensory and spiritual perception within models of human understanding. This approach is especially fruitful in the chapter on Pearl, in which Stanbury usefully compares the description of the dreamer/narrator's experience with that of St John as medieval iconography represents it in manuscripts of the poem's main source, Revelations. Manuscript illustration both defines John interestingly in spatial terms with regard to his vision of the heavenly city and conveys how the divine redirects John's human desire to spiritual ends, and thus powerfully complements the Gawain-Poet's own interest in 'spatial complexity' and human perception: awareness ofJohn's spiritual position gives further poignancy to the Pearl-dreamer's location in the world of the senses. The readings of Purity and Patience are more limiting, perhaps because the argument that the texts show one 'how to read' in spiritual terms appears tacitly to assume that a perfect mode of knowing somehow exists 'outside' the human, that the idea of the sight of God is not itself a human construct, whereas I would argue that the Gawain-Poet's play on language in these two poems works to suggest the reverse. For example, to assert that Purity 'offers methodologies for interpreting God's law' (p. 7I), is to be over-optimistic about the possibility of our perceiving the ways of God when the poem's relentless anthropomorphism of the Diety tends rather to throw back to humanity only a distorted image of itself. The 'dissonance between tenor and vehicle' in the Wedding-Feast parable is curious as a means to 'heighten- ing' emphasis on models of Christian behaviour (p. 45). Surely it serves rather to</page><page sequence="2">point up (here as in the accounts of the Flood, and of the atrocities at Jerusalem) both the arbitrariness of God's law and the way in which descriptive language creates new emphases, and so challenges the reader to appreciate not only the role of the inscribed perceiver(s) but also how the rhetoric of description influences and shapes the very act of perception as the reader experiences it. In her discussion of Patience, Stanbury eloquently demonstrates how the quality of the descriptions of the enclosing spaces of ship, whale, and woodbine makes us share in and respond to Jonah's sensory perception and thus his humanity. Yet the descriptions serve a double function, for they also show how 'patience is in part the art of learning to read God's messages in visual signs' (p. 92). But one can also argue that this apparent tension between what one might designate spiritual wisdom and cognition of things temporal dissolves in the poem's blurring of these categories through its play upon the cultural and spiritual assumptions behind rhetorical and spatial enclosure: this play both suggests Jonah is trapped as much by accepted typology (he cannot escape being a Christ-figure, for example (11. 95-96)) as by an all-determining God, and shows how the narrator, in rewritingJonah's experience as a recommendation of long-suffering, simultaneously constructs his own world as one of constraint upon action, the better to counsel pragmatism in the absence of spiritual understanding. This makes the poem an even more sophisticated comment on the limitations of human perception. The analysis of Sir Gawian and the Green Knight justly notes the poem's constant shifts in points of view, but again, the reader is equipped not only with a partial and temporary sensory knowledge (p. Io7) but with a wealth of assumptions and prejudices about narrative form, genre, character, and the decorum of particular spaces: the reader is thus more radically implicated in the poem's exposition of moral choices than the focus on discrete narrative points of view intimates. In a thoughtful and thought-provoking book, Stanbury makes the valuable affirmation that the Gawain-Poet uses description to dramatize the limitations of human experience and knowledge. I would want to argue only that what is termed the author's 'scepticism' in regard to 'ocular perception' extends beyond an exploration of the attractions and limitations of individuals' sensory experiences within the poems: for such an exploration is itself mediated through a descriptive rhetoric that is part of an even richer and more searching literary programme than this study suggests, one whereby all modes of knowing are laid bare so as to make the reader question her/his own cultural perceptions.

(Medieval Texts and Studies, 6) East Lansing, MI: Colleagues Press. 199I. xxi + 235 pp. ?I9.95. Lincoln College Oxford MS Lat. 130 consists of a series of paper fragments extracted from the bindings of MS Lat. 129, a compilation of material in English and Latin made in the West Country for use in a school. Some of the material in MS 129 was written by Thomas Schort, who taught for a time in a Bristol school in the first half of the fifteenth century. The fragments in MS I30 were probably compiled by him and then used to pad the binding of MS 129 when he had finished with them. Folios 7r-9v contain an incomplete Middle English Accedence and I o-I 3r a treatise on syntax in English attributed to a Magister Wacfilde, the Regemina secundum Magistrum Wacfilde. It is these two texts which Cynthia Renee Bland has edited in this book. The Accedence occupies pages 145-64 of this book, but as the commentary fills the bottom 7I6 Reviews</page></plain_text>
