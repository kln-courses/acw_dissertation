<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME 39, No. 2 DECEMBER 1951 SOME PROBLEMS OF PLANT RANGE AND DISTRIBUTION* BY W. B. TURRILL Royal Botanic Garden, Kew Presidential addresses, like other recurrent phenomena, can be variously classified. Quantitatively they may be long or short; qualitatively they may be good or bad. Some deal authoritatively with a relatively narrow subject, others review a larger field. Among presidential addresses to the British Ecological Society we have recently had examples of the intensive class so brilliant that any attempt of mine along similar lines would be a degenerate post-climax. There is, however, something to be said for an occasional attempt to survey a wide series of related problems. For to-day, I have chosen an extensive and somewhat vague title to cover a variety of facts most of which I have met personally and many of which still await full explanation. For the first time in the history of our Society, a professional taxonomist has been chosen as president. While this is a compli- ment to the great institution with which I have been connected for over 40 years, it obviously has its dangers. However, taxonomists are becoming more and more omnivorous and perhaps one day ecology itself will be classified as a branch of taxonomy. Though this address is largely based on some of my own experiences and on problems I have had to consider in my work at Kew I have tried so to use my material as to stimulate interest, particularly that of our younger members, in matters that link up ecology, cytogenetics, ard taxonomy. The two words 'range' and 'distribution' are in my title. By 'range' is intended the geo- graphical area within which, at a given time, a taxon or a plant community is to be found. Ranges can be mapped in various ways graphically to present relationships to environmental features, such as altitude, climate, or soil, or to demonstrate the resemblances and dif- ferences between the range of one taxon or community and that of another. 'Distribution' is the detailed occurrence of a taxon or community within its range, and signifies more intensive and more ecological study than merely indicating geographical extent. Further, it includes attempts to explain the facts of range and has, therefore, to take into account the past as well as the present. Only too often the taxonomist can give the range of, say, a species, with a considerable degree of precision and completeness, but is unable to explain satisfactorily its distribution within that range. With regard to actual mapping of ranges and distributions I propose to say no more than to call your attention to the two symposia held in London last year, the one jointly by the Systematics Association and the Royal Geographical Society and the other by the Botanical Society of the British Isles. It is understood that accounts of these are to be published. Analysis of range or distribution of taxa can be on more than one basis. A taxonomic basis may be selected following the best available monographic studies. This can have the advantage of using a clear and equally balanced classification of 'related' taxa whose ranges can be mapped and compared. If the classification be a good general one, i.e. if all possible characters have been taken into consideration in its making, one may assume that it * The substance of this paper was read as Presidential Address before the British Ecological Society on 6 January 1951. J. Ecol. 39 14</page><page sequence="2">206 Some problems of plant range and distribution reflects some aspects of phylogeny. The comparative study of ranges and distributions of taxa within the group will then very possibly throw light on the place of origin, the migra- tion, and the history of range changes of the group as a whole and the taxa within it. A second basis is the floristic. This involves a range or distribution analysis of a flora not of a taxon. Analyses have been made, for example, of the British flora and the flora of the Balkan Peninsula. An advantage of using this basis, if the whole flora be analysed, is that there is no selection of examples to prove a preconceived hypothesis. One can properly balance positive and negative evidence for migration routes, for possible previous land connexions, and for past climatic changes. A third basis is an ecological one. The ranges of constituent taxa of a given plant community can be studied, say of mangroves, high mountain grassland, or beech forest. There is a wide field for research on this basis. I would like to see undertaken a thorough study of ranges of the taxa of the arable weed flora of the British Isles, of the constituent members of the steppes of eastern Europe, and of the genera and species of a selected area of East African savanna. A danger in what follows in this address is that, since I can only quote a very limited number of examples and have naturally selected these as good illustrations of this or that point, I may unconsciously show bias and thus be unfair to my subject. I can only say that I have tried to look at problems from all points of view and repeat that I regard many of them as still unsolved. One other introductory matter may be briefly commented upon. We are all famillar with the text-book statement that environmental factors influencing or controlling distribution can be grouped as climatic, edaphic, or biotic. It is usually added that these have varied in the course of time and some writers add a fourth group as 'historical'. In deference to those historians who maintain that history is limited to written records of the human story we may drop the word historical. Logically, there are two possible classifications of the above groups of environmental factors: (1) Past: (a) climatic; (b) edaphic; (c) biotic. Present: (a) climatic; (b) edaphic; (c) biotic. (2) Climatic: (a) past; (b) present. Edaphic: (a) past; (b) present. Biotic: (a) past; (b) present. Either of these classifications can be used, but they should not be confused. That climatic, edaphic and biotic factors interact in innumerable and sometimes complicated ways, and that the present is not discontinuous with the past are obvious truisms to every ecologist and every phytogeographer. FACTS AND PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH WIDELY RANGING SPECIES The collector's curse, which has so often descended on taxonomists, has led to over- emphasizing the interest and scientific value of 'rare' species, whether they be 'rare' for their total range or for a more restricted area. An ecological viewpoint helps to redress this bias with due stress on the importance of dominant or common species in many communities. Widely ranging species have not received so much attention from phyto- geographers as they deserve and there is here a wide field for research. Of the 6530 species of Spermatophyta accepted for the flora of the Balkan Pensinula, 141 were scored as 'cosmopolitan', in the sense that they occurred in the northern and southern and the</page><page sequence="3">W. B. TURRILL 207 eastern and western hemispheres. No less than 1114 had a range extending at least through most of the East North Temperate geographical region. Two ecological classes contribute most prominently to these 'wides': aquatic, marsh, or bog plants and weeds and ruderals. The latter have no doubt been dispersed by human activities. It is generally held that water-birds have been the most important agents in dispersing disseminules of aquatic and marsh plants. Ano-ther group of very widely ranging species is frequently called 'pan-tropical'. No complete list of these has been traged, still less have they been analysed as a phyto- geographical group-analysed as regards their taxonomy, their taxonomic relationships, their variation, their detailed distribution, and their ecology. Here again is a subject for research by synthetic methods. Such lists as have been seen in the works of Guppy (1912), Ridley (1930), and others, show that two groups are well represented: plants dispersed by sea currents and those certainly or probably spread widely by man. Guppy, for example, gives lists of beach plants including pan-tropical species which have buoyant seeds or fruits that can float for a long time unharmed in the sea. There is conclusive evidence of some having been carried by currents across the Atlantic from west to east, for example, and arriving at the far side in a viable condition. That man has dispersed many tropical species, intentionally as cultivated plants or unintentionally as weeds or by some other accidental method of transport, is acknowledged in many published accounts of, for instance, the floras of the Pacific Islands. Some of us would have the possibility kept in mind of human dispersal of many plants often accepted as 'native' in discontinuous areas. Written records are not available of all the voyages or travels of more or less early man, of so-called 'savage' or 'uncivilized' adventurers, or even of all explorers of the Middle Ages, still less of pirates, slave-traders, and other commercial gentlemen. Spain and Portugal had world-wide empires, and exchange of products from the early days of trade and colonization has very probably had more to do with the wide dispersal of many plant species than we are able to prove. However, there are undoubtedly examples of pan-tropical range involving other than disseminules carried by ocean currents or dispersed by man. On the whole, cryptogams, with their usually light-weight spores, can be more easily and widely dispersed than phanerogams with their generally heavier seeds. Information is insufficient for much sound generalization. Bisby (1933, 1943) has summarized many facts connected with the distribution of fungi, and concludes that the average range of species of fungi is greater than the average range of species of phanerogams. Saprophytes, in general, have a wider range than parasites. Fungi, however, with their dependence on dead organic matter or on living hosts, are less directly comparable with Spermatophyta than are autotrophic cryptogams. In the Bryophyta and Pteridophyta, the types of range in general appear to be similar to those of the seed-bearing plants. There is no published satisfactory statistical evidence for either group. The work of Irmscher on mosses suffers from faults of method, particularly in selecting data, the method of scoring ranges, and their presentation in support of the Wegener-K6ppen theories. It does seem, however, that proportionally more species and genera of Bryophyta and Pteridophyta' than Spermatophyta have a wide and even cosmo- politan range. Their distribution is also probably more often geographically discontinuous. A full comparative analysis of range and distribution of the three groups of Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, and Spermatophyta would probably throw light on several major problems of phytogeography some of which are discussed later. That plants dispersed mainly by 14-2</page><page sequence="4">208 Some problems of plant range and distribution light spores have on the whole wider ranges than plants dispersed mainly by heavier seeds suggests that dispersal mechanisms are more important than they are stated to be by some recent authors. On the other hand, a very large number of orchids, with their very light seeds, are local endemics of very restricted ranges. This may be due to extreme adaptation to a narrow range of conditions, and limiting factors, perhaps special conditions for germination, may often prevent range extension. It is worth while giving one example of the range of a widely ranging species, and Phragmites communis has been chosen. This occurs in most of Europe, the Orient, Madeira, North Africa, Central and North Asia, China, Korea, Formosa, Japan, India, Australia, Tropical Africa, South Africa, North America, Central America, West Indies, Tropical South America, and Temperate South America. It is represented by closely related species in Malaysia (P. karka), Polynesia (P. karka), and the Mascarene Islands (P. mauritianus). PROBLEMS OF DISCONTINUOUS RANGES 'Discontinuity' is a relative term, in that probably most species show some degree of break up into local populations whose individuals grow within an area continuous for pollination and for normal disseminule dispersal, but these local populations are separated one from another by distances not normally or regularly crossed by either pollen or dis- seminules. For the moment, however, we are concerned with very wide discontinuities within the ranges of taxa. Many of these involve oceanic separation but it is important to note that examples quite as striking occur over continental land masses. For some of them the phytogeographer can only give the facts and refrain from useless speculation. Ascolepis gracilis (Cyperaceae) from Siam and A. setigera from Nigeria form a distinct and isolated section of the genus (if not a separate genus) and are morphologically so similar that they were at first included in one species. Mr C. E. Hubbard has selected for me several examples from among the grasses. Fingerhuthia has one species from the Afghan-Indian border and two in South Africa. Redfieldia has one species in Madagascar and one in the United States. Trichoneura has one species in the Galapagos Islands, one in the United States, and the remainder in Africa and Arabia. Deschampsta setacea occurs in western Europe and in Temperate South America. Mr V. S. Summerhayes has shown me two strange instances of discontinuity of range amongst orchids. Ankylocheilos (Taeniophyllum pro parte) occurs in the Gold Coast, the Belgian Congo, and in the Malayan Archipelago. Tipularia has one species in the south-eastern United States, another in the Himalaya, and two in Szechuan. A doubtful species, that has not been seen by us, has been described from Japan. The well-known discontinuity in the range of the genus Hebe (formerly regarded as a section of Veroni"ca) between New Zealand and South America is often used as evidence for the former existence of an enlarged Antarctic continent. Occasionally fossils are known from areas more or less intermediate between dis- continuous parts of the present range of a taxon. Platanus is a good example which is also interesting from other points of view. P. orientalis is native in the southern parts of the Balkan Pensinula, Anatolia, Cyprus, Syria, and northern Persia. In the southern United States and in Mexico there are half a dozen other species of the genus, of which the best known is P. occidentalis. The width of the Mediterranean Sea added to that of the Atlantic Ocean separates the two discontinuous parts of the generic range. Fossils quite definitely determined as Platanus have, however, been recorded from many localities in Europe and America, notably from France and Greenland. Nevertheless, it is certain that</page><page sequence="5">W. B. TURRILL 209 P. orientalis and P. occidentalis were geographically separated for a very long period of time (the minimum has been estimated as a million years) till brought together by man in garden cultivation. Henry &amp; Flood (1919) showed by genetical experiment and historical research that the London plane (P. x acerifolia) originated at Oxford by the hybridization of P. orientalis and P. occidentalis. Later cytological investigations by Sax (1933) agree with their conclusions. Neither wild species over so long a period has so mutated as to alter the common chromosome number (n = 21) or to produce cross incompatibility genes. The hybrid (P. x acerifolia) is itself fairly fertile. Presumably those cytogeneticists who hold the extreme view that the only criterion of specific distinction is failure to breed together to produce fertile offspring would unite these plants into one species. This would be inconvenient but would not reduce the value (though it might blur it) of this example of discontinuity with morphological differentiation but not cytogenetic isolation. Fascinating problems are raised by so-called bi-polar ranges. The term 'bipolar' is not precise. What is intended is taxa with widely discontinuous ranges to the north and to the south of the tropics, that is to say species, genera, or families occurring in northern North America, central and northern Europe, and northern Asia and in southern South America, Australia, and New Zealand (and associated islands), or at least in some of these areas north and south of the tropics. The best instances are found amongst lichens and mosses, and include a fair number of species as well as groups of closely related species. Amongst seed-bearing plants the genus Carex provides examples, as do also the genera Draba and Armeria. Koenigia islandica, which has a more northern range than any other known annual, is recorded from the European, Asiatic, and North-American Arctic, the island of Skye, Faeroes, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Pamir, Tibet, Himalaya, North Mongolia, Kamschatka, West China, Labrador, Greenland, Alaska, and southern South America. Empetrum, with an almost continuous boreal range, is found in southernmost South America and the islands to the east. Primula, section Farinosae, subsection Eu-farinosae, is somewhat similar in range. In the North Temperate Region there are about a dozen species of the subsection with 9 as the basic chromosome number and with 2n = 18, 36, 54, 72, or 126. The only southern species is Primula magellanica in the southern part of South America with 2n = 72. Littorella has also a wide boreal range with an isolated one in southern South America. In a paper on Australian species of Asperula, Shaw &amp; Turrill (1928) recognized sixteen species in Australia, all endemic and limited to an area south-east of a line joining the Gawler Range, South Australia, with Rockingham Bay, Queensland. At least two species (endemic) occur in New Zealand. The vast majority of the known species of Asperula occur in southern Europe and the Orient. In the Northern Hemisphere the genus extends eastwards to Japan and southwards to Szechuan. It is not known irom Africa south of those parts belonging to the Mediterranean Region, or from the New World. It is of special interest to note that no species are known from the Indo-Malayan Region and that there is thus a wide gap in the range of the genus between the northern and the Austral- asian species. However, there are many genera which, so to speak, link these extreme examples of discontinuities with the more or less cosmopolitan type of range. They occur, in a number of species, on mountains in the tropics and at lower altitudes (and sometimes on mountains as well) in the boreal and austral areas. Ranunculus, Epilobium, and Cardamine are good examples. Ranunculus is a genus needing modern monographic study, and there are many</page><page sequence="6">210 Some problems of plant range and distribution species and groups of species within it that have ranges well worth detailed investigation. R. flammula and its allies may be particularly mentioned. Discontinuous ranges over seas and oceans raise acutely the problem of dispersal of disseminules over long distances. At the present time many writers accept the view that, apart from the action of oceanic currents and of man, this does not occur for terrestrial Spermatophyta. As a consequence, previous land connexions or continuities are postulated. My present opinion is that the problem is no more solved than it was in the time of J. D. Hooker and other earlier phytogeographers. Facile acceptance of the theory of continental drift as expounded by Wegener and Koppen has led some students of range and distribution to ignore problems that even this would not solve if it were true. The literature on the subject of continental drift is now considerable. Here it must suffice to emphasize a few points of importance. First, it must not be forgotten that shallow seas are, to land organisms, barriers as effective as are deep oceans, relative to size and shape. The evidence for wide transgressions of the sea over continents at different geological periods is proved by the sedimentary rocks laid down in these periods. It follows that, even if the continents have separated from one continuous mass, this mass was, over long periods, not all dry land but that much of it was sea surface. Transgressions of the sea at all the geological periods, at least since the advent of the Spermatophyta, retain their importance whether the hypothesis of continental drift be accepted or rejected. Secondly, the hypothesis of continental drift does seem to offer an explanation, or a partial explanation, of some problems of discontinuous ranges. In particular, there are the large number of genera, or closely related genera, common to Africa and South America. However, even this problem has not yet been properly analysed, for it is essential to keep a balance between positive and negative evidence by taking into account not only the similarities but also the dissimilarities between the floras on the two sides of the South Atlantic. There is so much evidence for north to south and south to north migration in both Africa and the Americas that one cannot help wondering if similarities are not due to a common northern or southern source or to both northern and southern sources. The discovery of a single Bromeliad [Pitcairnia feliciana (Chev.) Harms et Mildbr. in Notizbl. bot. Gart. Berl. 14, 118 (1938)] in West Africa (Fouta-Djalon, French Guinea) is not incompatible with transoceanic dispersal. It is unlikely that only one member of this important American family would be represented as a relict of a previous continental continuity. It remains doubtful whether the cactaceous genus Rhipsalis is native in Africa and Asia, but if not it indicates very early spread by man from America and raises the question whether some other present-day African-American ranges are not due to the early navigators, especially the Portuguese and Spaniards with colonies and trading stations on both sides of the South Atlantic. Nevertheless, while it may be possible to explain the various ranges including Africa and South America by other means, continental drift would explain many of them fairly satisfactorily. Thirdly, it is frequently overlooked that Wegener and Koppen intimately associated complicated movements of the polar axis with their hypothesis of continental drift. Much of their supposed evidence falls to the ground if the former be not accepted. Palaeo- botanists appear to be almost or quite unanimous in concluding that the distribution of Mesozoic and Tertiary fossil floras around the poles is against alteration in the position of the poles during those periods.</page><page sequence="7">W. B. TURRILL 211 Fourthly, the majority of geologists and geophysicists are now antagonistic to the hypothesis of continental drift. At the British Association meeting at Birmingham in September 1950 a symposium was held on the subject and it was remarkable that, while most of the biologists demanded either continental drift or something to take its place, all those speakers who had studied the subject apart from the ranges of organisms rejected it. The wisdom of accepting as a causal explanation a geological-geophysical hypothesis discarded by those who are best qualified to judge of its probable truth seems doubtful. Fifthly, continental drift by itself offers no explanation of the numerous discontinuities of range known from what are continuous land masses. QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE EFFICIENCY OF TRANSPORT AGENTS There has, in the past, been great controversy regarding the effectiveness of some transport agencies for disseminules over long distances. The evidence for wide dispersal by ocean currents of such seeds or other disseminules as can withstand long immersion in sea water is not disputed. It is also accepted that man has been and is the most effective of all transporting agents. One may, however, suggest that prehistoric man (a relative phrase in that the beginning of written history varies greatly from country to country) may have been more active, consciously or unconsciously, as a seed disperser than we realize. If he had no trouser turn-ups or cuffs he presumably had wrappings which ranged from fig- leaves to the skins of animals and which no doubt harboured the potentialities of both flora and fauna. In reading such a series of reliable books on prehistory as Peake and Fleure's The Corridors of Time (9 volumes, Oxford, 1927-36) one is struck by the numerous and extensive migrations and interchanges proved by archaeological evidence. However, leaving aside sea-currents and man, two agents of transport have been much discussed in connexion with our present problems: winds (in the broad sense) and birds. It is necessary to recall several truisms before discussing the present position with regard to wind and bird transport. First, even if they be agents for long-distance transport of some disseminules they obviously have their limits. Many fruits and seeds cannot be carried effectively any great way by either for the simple reason that they are too large or too heavy or retain their vitality for too short a time. Secondly, the enormous numbers of seeds produced by many plants and the very long period of time available, even at the rate of one seed harvest a year, mean that effective dispersal needs only to involve an infinitesimal proportion of potentially available disseminules. Thirdly, dispersal is only one factor in bringing about increase of range or the initiation of range discontinuities. To be effective there must follow establishment which involves space and environmental conditions suitable for germination, growth, and reproduction, often in competition with previously established vegetation. Let us deal first with air movements. There is excellent evidence that spores, pollen grains, bacteria, and other light botanical objects, are carried high into the atmosphere and dispersed, sometimes in a viable condition, over very great distances. The records of catches in aeroplanes, on ships at sea, or from towers on land are yielding valuable data. Seeds, however, seem very generally quite absent from the catches as recorded, when these have been taken far from or far above the land. Apart from abstracting many published papers on this subject I wrote to Prof. N. Polunin of McGill University and he replied: 'In answer to your...query as to whether during my flights over the North Pole, etc. I have managed to trap any seeds or fruits of any kind in the upper atmosphere. It has to be</page><page sequence="8">212 Some problems of plant range and distribution answered in the negative, at least so far. ... We have ... lately made quite a few long-distance flights over the mainland without coming across fruits or seeds in the upper atmosphere- though to be sure our catching methods are hardly suitable for other than microscopic particles.' The only positive evidence I have found are some records by Chase (1935), who stated that seeds taken in insect traps released at different altitudes from an aeroplane were sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for study. More than half were those of grasses, for the most part Paspalum urvillei and P. dilatatum. Of thirty collections, made at from 200 to 5000 ft., all included spikelets of the first species and about half included the latter species as well. One collection each of P. pubiflorum and Hordeum pusillum were obtained. It seems that Prof. Polunin was right in his suggestion that most experimental researches on the biotic content of the atmosphere have not been planned to catch fruits and seeds, and when these have been caught they have not been the objects of interest. The suggestion is put forward to our devoted secretaries that the British Ecological Society might organize a summer excursion to the upper atmosphere to study this problem in sttu. An indirect, though experimental method, is based on settling velocities. Lloyd Praeger (1911) records experiments with the seeds or fruits of ninety-one species of British plants falling through a still atmosphere. He found that, on the whole, plume seeds or fruits were better adapted for wind-dispersal than either the winged or powder ones. The place of honour was given to Typha latifolia, followed by Epilobium palustre and Salix repens. Epipactis palustris, amongst powder seeds, was nearly equal to the creeping willow in air buoyancy of its seeds. At the Stockholm International Botanical Congress last year Boor Patterson recorded the settling velocities in air of diaspores of twelve species. His figures involved some 17,000 determinations and are given as calculations that one diaspore in a million will reach a stated distance with wind of 10 m./sec. His figures show some agree- ment with those of Praeger, but Typha latifolia is well below the distances calculated for Chamaenerium, Epilobium adenocaulon and Salix capraea, species not used by Praeger. Ten metres a second comes within number 5 of the Beaufort Scale with statute miles of 19-24/hr. and is described as a 'fresh breeze in which smacks shorten sail and small trees in leaf begin to sway'. Winds above 70 miles/hr. are said to be very rarely experienced, while the term 'hurricane' is given to velocities above 75 miles/hr. However, velocity is only part of the story. Modern aeronautical research has shown that the atmosphere is more varied in its movements than the sea, and more changeable than even the female sex of the human species. Currents, eddies, pockets, and other aeronautical jargon, indicate the lack of uniformity in the atmosphere. The experience of gliders is particularly sug- gestive. Upward and downward currents are frequent or even constant features especially near elevations, and this makes it very probable that the results of laboratory experiments of velocity of fall in still or horizontally moving air cannot be considered to indicate what happens frequently in nature. Disseminules can certainly be carried upwards to consider- able and perhaps very considerable heights by currents and by tornadoes and swept along horizontally. Indeed, one wonders if the greater risk is sometimes failure to fall than failure to rise and be horizontally transported. If long-distance air transport of fruits and seeds occur one might expect their landing frequently to be on mountains, and there may be some connexion here with the fact that many range discontinuities are from mountain massif to mountain massif, as in the floras of the mountains of Tropical Africa. The time seems ripe for greater collaboration between students of aeronautics and botanists interested in dispersal. There are many questions one would like to ask those</page><page sequence="9">W. B. TURRILL 213 who now know so much regarding the carrying power and rates of movement of masses of air. As already indicated we have little concrete evidence in favour of long-distance wind transport of the diaspores of Spermatophyta, but this may well be because we have not yet conducted the right experiments to obtain the evidence and it seems dangerous to over- value our present negative results. The other agent for long-distance dispersal over land or sea is migrating birds. Here, again, the evidence is meagre. It has often been stated that migrating birds travel with empty insides and clean outsides. Ostenfeld (1901) quotes the results of examining birds killed at Danish lighthouses as proving this. Scharff (1907) probably refers to the same observations when he says that Winge and Knud Andersen examined many thousands of migratory birds and found that their crops and stomachs were always empty. Moreover, they never observed any seeds adhering to the feathers, beaks, or feet of the birds. I have consulted four expert British ornithologists for personal information on the subject and none of them had any. They all showed interest and it may be possible to stir them to action. Bird mortality at lighthouses has, I believe, been greatly reduced in recent years by protective devices. However, in The Sunday Times for 29 October 1950 it was stated 'more than 15,000 migrating birds, dazzled by the light, have killed themselves in recent weeks by flying into the Cape Frehel lighthouse, near Dinan, France'. If anything like this still happens round our British coasts would ornithologists combine with botanists in a post-mortem examination to prove or disprove that the earlier observations have wide validity? Much is known regarding migration routes, times of migration, and the immense numbers of birds involved in migrations. It would be strange if an occasional viable diaspore did not reach a new far-distant area by this means. Yet we want positive facts. Henshaw recorded that in 1911 members of an expedition 'were especially requested to examine carefully all their specimens of Laysan birds for the presence of seeds, and actually found attached to the foot of a Laysan albatross a seed of the bean-caper family, which is generally distributed in the South Sea islands. So far as known the plant does not grow on Laysan, .... A still more striking instance of a bird acting as a carrier of seeds was observed several years ago by Mr Bryan on Marcus Island, where he found no fewer than forty seeds of a tree of the madder family adhering to the feathers of a shearwater. These and other similar facts show how the flora of oceanic islands may be transported by birds from island to island or from continents to distant shores.' I have been forced to conclude that there is very little reliable evidence for or against long-distance transport, other than by ocean currents and by man. On both sides there have been too many dogmatic statements made and even illogical conclusions drawn without factual evidence, and one can only plead that this be sought and meantime be very cautious in affirming or denying the potentialities of wind or bird transport. THE POSSIBILITIES OF SEVERAL ORIGINS OF A TAXON In discussing discontinuous ranges we have assumed that a taxon has had one place and one time of origin and that its existing range and distribution have resulted from dispersal and establishment from one centre starting and continuing from one period of time. The possibilities of a polytopic or polychronic origin are discussed from time to time by phytogeographers. There is no doubt that mutations can recur at a gene locus. Hence the same characters can arise, and have arisen, probably sometimes fairly frequently, at different times and in different places. In Centaurea nigra (s.l.), for example, we have</page><page sequence="10">214 Some problems of plant range and distribution numerous records of 'Marguerite Yellow' variants occurring in various widely separated populations. However, 'characters' may be phenotypically indistinguishable but geneti- cally different as, for example, in some of the yellow-green variants of Silene maritima which cannot be separated except by giving different breeding results. When only one or two gene differences are involved polychronic or polytopic gene mutation may, and no doubt quite often does, account for discontinuous ranges. Fraxinus pallisae may have originated independently in the Danube and Maritza deltas by gene mutation from the widely ranging F. oxycarpa. When, however, a taxon is distinguished from all other taxa by the constancy of association of a greater number of differential characters, a number of origins, separate in time or space, becomes less and less likely proportional to the number of such characters. This follows simply from the laws of chance. Chromosome mutations, such as multiplication of chromosome sets, have been proved to occur polytopically and polychronically, and, since polyploidy is widespread in the plant kingdom, in so far as such chromosome mutations result in new taxa such may occur at more than one time and/or in more than one place. Hybridization between two taxa occurs again and again and in so far as hybridization results in new taxa polychrony and polytopy may again occur. Hybridization followed by chromosome multiplication gave Miintzing his arti- ficially produced Galeopsis tetrahit and there is no reason why Sjiartina townsendii should not arise elsewhere than in the Solent if the parents S. stricta and S. alterniflora meet. Polytopy and polychrony must be considered as possible partial explanations of range discontinuities of micro-taxa. They do not explain discontinuities of many-charactered taxa. Further, the same explanation of polytopy or polychrony cannot be extended to the parental stock. Ramonda serbica (2n = 72) in the western Balkan Peninsula may have originated from R. nathaliae (2n = 36) independently of its origin in eastern Serbia. This would so far 'explain' a discontinuity in its range, but it would not explain the dis- continuity within Ramonda between the Pyrenees and the Balkan Peninsula or the still greater discontinuity between the European and Chinese Gesneriaceae. PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH CONTINUOUS OR NARROW RANGES AND WITH DISTRIBUTION Vicarious species. 'Jordan's Law' was formulated by a zoologist on zoological evidence. It has been defined as: 'Given any species in any region, the nearest related species is not likely to be found in the same region, nor in a remote region, but in a neighbouring district separated from the first by a barrier of some sort or at least by a belt of country the breadth of which gives the effect of a barrier.' Amongst plants there are many exceptions to this 'law', as in the genera Bidens, Betula and Nasturtium, for example. Consider the last genus with its two species N. officinale and N. microphyllum (N. uniseriatum). In and by the River Glyme in Oxfordshire and the River Wey in Surrey I could find no distribu- tional differences at all between the two species. They grew side by side or in alternating individuals or groups. Around Blenheim Lake there was some slight evidence that N. officinale succeeded better on drying mud than N. microphyllum, but no other suggestion of differences in habitat preferences could be found. More recently I have found both in Jersey in similar habitats. There are, however, also supporting examples in plants. The common bluebell, Endymion non-scriptus, and the Spanish bluebell, E. hispanicus, in their natural geographical ranges occupy approximately contiguous but distinct areas. The former is native over most of France and the British Isles and the latter over much of Spain and Portugal. The two</page><page sequence="11">W. B. TURRILL 215 species are typical Atlantic phytogeographical elements that occupy respectively more northern and more southern parts of Atlantic Europe. Parallel variations occur in the two species and they produce partially fertile hybrids when brought together in gardens, as in my own garden at Kew. Silene maritima is ecologically vicarious with S. cucubalus. Chionodoxa cretica and C. nana, are altitudinally vicarious one with another. Both are endemic to Crete. Endemics. The term 'endemic' is relative in that it means, as now generally used in biology, a taxon or an ecological group limited in range to the geographical area under consideration. Confusion arises if this, or a similar, definition be not strictly applied. There is no doubt that endemic taxa have special phytogeographical interest and raise special problems. They should, however, be considered together with, and not in isolation from, the non-endemics. The number of endemics and the kind of endemism give some indication of the length of isolation of the flora under analysis. Actual figures, however, need cautious interpretation and due consideration must also be given to the size of the total flora, the size of the area covered, the degree of naturalness of the boundaries of the area, and the physiographic diversity of the area. It is often possible to decide by careful taxonomic studies whether one is dealing with a neo-endemic or a palaeo-endemic. Such a classification is relative to the taxonomic status and one not infrequently has to deal with, for example, a young microspecies of an old genus. Thus Haberlea ferdinandi-coburgii is classed as a neo-endemic in Bulgaria of the eastern Balkan Peninsular palaeo-endemic genus Haberlea. A high proportion of palaeo-endemics points to an old or, more accurately, long isolated flora. A high proportion of neo-endemics causes one to search for conditions resulting in rapid evolution of new, and often micro-, taxa. The floras of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Hawaii are island flora of long isolation. The floras of Mt Athos, Mt Kinabalu, and the Pakaraima Range with Mt Roraima are mountain floras with old endemics. South-western Australia, western China, and south-west South Africa are continental areas with highly endemic floras. What, on the basis of taxonomic studies, have to be regarded as neo- endemics are often concentrated in areas where there has been considerable recent dis- turbance of the plant life. Closed plant communities are barriers to the spread of range of species not belonging to them. If they be destroyed, secondary successions involve the extension of range and the meeting of quite different kinds of plants. There are many examples of such secondary successions caused by man's activities and often maintained well below the climax by continuation of these activities. Thus, in the Mediterranean Region there are thousands of square miles of deforested hill slopes over-grazed by sheep and goats in periodic transhumance. Forest destruction has allowed the spread of helio- philes suited in one way or another to exposed relatively dry habitats. Species formerly isolated now have their ranges overlapping. New mutations have appeared and hybridiza- tion has occurred resulting in new taxa (especially micro-species) and in hybrid swarms. The genera Silene, Dianthus, Thymus, Asperula, and Verbascum are good examples. Owing particularly to the peculiarities of Mediterranean physiography many of these neo-endemics still remain rather local. Neo-endemics are of great interest to the ecologist in that they may provide excellent material for the study of variously extending ranges and of barriers to distributions on a comparative basis. Whether a neo-endemic be regarded as a distinct species or a subspecies or variety of a more widely ranging species is in itself of quite secondary importance. If it can be recognized and most conveniently named a study can be made of its spread or of its failure to spread. Here we come into contact with the</page><page sequence="12">216 Some problems of plant range and distribution true problems of age and area as distinct from the sometimes false ones posed by statistical analyses of lists of names. How has it happened that Silene subconica var. grisebachii is restricted to a short narrow piece of sandy coast near Porto Lagos, Thrace, while the var. subconica has a very much wider range through parts of Greece, Thessaly, North and South Macedonia, Thrace, North and South Bulgaria, the Rodope Massif, the Dobruja, Serbia, Hercegovina, and Asia Minor? Palaeo-endemics raise the controversial problems of old age in species and other taxa. The terms 'old age', 'senescence', 'senility' and the like are in some ways unfortunate. A false analogy is drawn between individuals and taxa, the latter in any concrete sense being populations. The words tend to introduce teleological and anthropomorphic con- cepts. If it be accepted that strictly speaking old age and its accompanying symptoms are concerned with the physiology of individuals one has still to be very careful in applying it to plants. Animals grow old, plants become old in certain parts only while their meristems retain all the characters of youth indefinitely. One recalls the debates regarding supposed senility in cultivated plants long propagated vegetatively, such as potatoes, sugar-cane, and banana. It is now generally conceded that the described symptoms are due to invasion by diseases, especially viruses, passed on through the ramets of a clone. There is no evidence of other physiological or of any genetical degeneration. There is no evidence of wearing out of meristematic tissues whether at somatic growing points or in gamete formation. Nevertheless, we know from palaeobotanical evidence that taxa disappear. It is most likely that the great majority die out though some may change by homogenesis into new taxa. We are very ignorant of the causes of death of individuals in wild floras and still more of the death of species. Natural selection, in so far as it leads to highly specialized adapta- tion, increases vulnerability if environmental conditions change. A genetic constitution which allows of great plasticity in the body structure and functions of its individuals is an insurance against extinction of a taxon in a changing environment. Over a long period of time, the maintenance of such a constitution for plasticity is a better insurance than a high degree of genetic variability alone within the taxon as a whole. Either natural selection will tend to isolate variants in different special habitats, and in due course they will be exterminated as the environment changes, or in the area as a whole variants will one after another cease to survive a series of environmental changes. A species, or other taxon, genetically less variable but composed of individuals with more plastic bodies provides poorer material for destructive selection. Out-breeding, by giving some degree of hybridization, may restore variability and thus act against the long-range process of taxon extinction resulting from the combination of changing habitats and natural selection, but isolation reduces the chances of hybridization between variants. In considering the death of taxa we have to consider environments and genetic consti- tutions together. Under an environment stable for a very long time-even geologically 'long'-increasing adaptation gives increasing chances of survival in the competitive struggle for existence. This may be what happens in the tropical rain forest. If so, one would not seek for primitive taxa or primitive characters amongst the denizens of the tropical rain forest. With changing environments adaptation to any one environment, if based on genetic selection, may be disadvantageous in the long run. Species, or other taxa, verging to extinction may thus be species out of the environment to which they are specially adapted and which have few biotypes and are not sufficiently plastic. Old age merely in the</page><page sequence="13">W. B. TURRILL 217 sense of many years, centuries, millennia, or generations has in itself nothing to do with the conservatism, lack of aggressiveness and domination, failure successfully to compete, and other characters supposed to be symptomatic of taxon senility. It is a question of gene constitution relative to environment. Change one or the other and the symptons may disappear. Haberlea rhodopensis has already been mentioned. It is a Tertiary relict of restricted range in western Bulgaria and western Thrace. It might well have been taken as a species that has outlived its time and is ready for death from old age, if such existed for species. It grows on shady rocks and banks in montane areas. Man, by cutting down forest and otherwise opening up the country, has caused the appearance of rocky and stony banks suitable for colonization by H. rhodopensis and has removed obstacles to dispersal. As a result the species is increasing in numbers and in distribution if not in range. I have seen it occupying newly opened up areas and obviously extending in the southern Rodope Massif, almost as a ruderal along road banks. It is now behaving, locally at least, as an aggressive species. It is an 'old' type, genetically in no sense 'senile', but now 'rejuvenated' ecologically-if one should use such terms at all. The experience of gardeners in cultivating various species supposedly showing signs of 'old age' in the wild does not support any hypothesis of inherent or cytogenetical senescence for most of them. Many flourish under cultivation when conditions are decidedly different from those of their native habitats, especially with the removal of competition with other species of plants. Of course, even if there be physiological somatic vigour under cultivation there may be weak spots of which the two commonest are failure to set viable seeds or failure of regular seed germination or seedling establishment in artificial conditions except under very careful nursing. It is, perhaps, worth referring here to the subject of ecological plasticity which may be defined as the potentialities of expression of physiological characters that determine what factors of the environment shall limit the distribution of a species or other taxon. The degree of such plasticity (whether or not it be correlated with morphological plasticity) is a character (or a summation of characters) of even a homozygote. It is, in a homozygote, in no sense cumulative or reducible but is, nevertheless, of very great survival importance. Here is another subject that would well repay wide comparative investigation by experi- ments. There is some evidence that some heterozygotes are more and some less ecologically plastic than their parental homozygotes. Generally, plasticity of all kinds in a taxon is increased by increase in the number of biotypes. However, this still requires full in- vestigation. In spite of what has been said, several theoretical possibilities of genetical degeneration of a taxon can be suggested. If anything approaching mass mutation occurs then, since most mutations are deleterious, there is a good chance that selection will speedily reduce numbers even to the point of extinction. High polyploidy, by masking mutations, has been considered to be a cause of 'senescence' in taxa. Yet again, mutations having some temporary advantages may in the long run be disadvantageous, as by pleiotropic action reducing mutation rate and therefore variability. By their advantageous phenotypic reactions they may become for the time being characteristic of a taxon which, however, will eventually suffer through lack of variability in competition with taxa that have retained a higher rate of mutation. It is difficult to summarize the pros and cons of supposed 'old age' in taxa. Evidence of deterioration of the genetic system in the sense of wearing out or accumulation of deleterious genes is absent or unsatisfactory. Certainly nothing unusual in the cyto-</page><page sequence="14">218 Some problems of plant range and distribution genetical systems has been recorded in many of the so-called relict species showing supposed ecological signs of 'senility'. There is, however, a whole series of problems con- nected with palaeo-endemics. Many of them have not been studied more than super- ficially. They need both cytogenetical and autecological investigation. There is abundant material for research, if field work be possible in the areas rich in endemism. INVESTIGATION OF LIMITING FACTORS The attempt to classify endemics into neo-endemics, palaeo-endemics, and intermediates raises the wider problems of limiting factors in general. Very often most valuable questions can be framed by assuming that the range of a taxon would be cosmopolitan but for one or more limiting factors or combination of factors in the environment, given the gene content of the taxon. Personally I have often found-the limiting factor concept a more useful tool than its converse, the toleration concept. The gardener knows well that many plants tolerate conditions very different from those they meet in the wild. Indeed, he sometimes has to give them a combination of conditions that appear to be almost the opposite of those they tolerate in nature because of the impossibility of copying all the natural environmental factors on a garden scale. Thus, some coastal semi-desert or desert plants have to be given extra supplies of water to compensate for the absence of moist sea air and mists. It is well known that many plants from high latitudes or high altitudes require shelter and protection during the winter in many English gardens. Their native habitats have much more severe climates than ours, but mild wet winter weather with no long continuous snow cover is harmful to many northern and high mountain plants and they have to be kept in a frame or a greenhouse to survive our winters. Some Mexican and other short-day plants grow rapidly and flower in the late autumn and winter in this country and have then to be given special conditions that they would not require if growth and flowering could be induced to occur in the summer. At Kew, cotton can only be grown successfully to the flowering state in a boggy substratum. Drosophyllum lusitanicum is a dry habitat plant in the Iberian Peninsula. Seedlings have to be kept in dry well-drained soil at Kew till about 9 months old. The plants then do best if moved to humid conditions very different from those of the natural habitat. Conditions, especially of light, in this country sometimes cause too rapid growth with elongated internodes. This may be partially rectified by root pruning or restricting root growth to a small place. The gardener can often modifythe influence of limiting factors indirectlywithout removing them. Limiting factors are most varied. Let us consider a few examples. In the Transplant Experiments of the British Ecological Society we found that Anthyllis vulneraria flourished exceedingly well on several of the soils up to the flowering stage and plants then suddenly succumbed to the attacks of root and crown attacking fungi (Verticillium). It appeared as if the very lush growth of the plants, partly connected with the absence of competition and of grazing, made them more susceptible to the parasite. Environmental conditions were all exceedingly favourable to growth and reproduction, especially on chalky clay, but they were also favourable to the disease-producing organism which was a limiting factor to establishment under these conditions. Flowering period is a character requiring extensive comparative study. There is plenty of scattered evidence that genes and environment are involved in various ratios. Photo- periodism has been shown to be a factor limiting ranges in many species. The well-known classification into long-day, short-day, and more or less indifferent plants has obvious</page><page sequence="15">W. B. TURRILL 219 phytogeographical significance. A limited number of species has been investigated genetically for flowering time. In Tagetes erecta early flowering is a Mendelian recessive. In Solidago sempervirens variants within this short-day species can be distinguished by the dates of flower initiation and these are controlled primarily by the length of the photoperiod and the rates of bud development. The minimum number of genes deter- mining these physiological differences has been determined as 9 and they are probably located in many, if not in all, of the linkage groups. Photoperiodism, of course, influences other characters than flowering. Swedish and Danish forest geneticists have shown the importance, both for explaining natural range and for applied forestry, of the occurrence of photoperiodic variants in such genera as Populus, Salix, Acer, Robinia and Pinus. In British knapweeds of the Centaurea nigra group Marsden-Jones and Turrill have found many variants characterized by different flowering periods. The differences have a genetic basis and when combined with other characters, such as different flower colours or presence or absence of ray florets, give rather striking results in plant-breeding beds. In the wild, different flowering periods are sometimes associated with different local environments and then partially characterize ecotypes, as in the Oxford district, which has a greater diversity in Centaurea populations than any other area I know in the British Isles. There has also been natural selection on a latitudinal basis but the story is somewhat complicated. It would be interesting to score for photoperiodic reaction all the known examples of species showing so-called bi-polar ranges. If they, or many of them, be obligate long-day plants this would suggest that they have 'jumped the tropics' in their dispersal and that their now discontinuous ranges do not represent relicts of former continuous ranges. In this connexion it is interesting to note that most North Temperate species can quickly adapt themselves to flowering some 6 months later (or earlier) in South Temperate lands. This applies to all cultivated crops such as cereals, vegetables, and fruit trees. The reverse is also true. Thus Doryphora sassifras flowers in Australia in July and at Kew in January. Atherosperma moschatum flowers from August to October in Australia and in February in Dorset. Limiting factors with regard to pollination mechanisms are illustrated by the classic example of the coincidence in the boundaries of the ranges of Aconitum and Bombus, except in South America (see Knuth, 1908). Amongst the orchids there must be many other species besides Angraecum sesquipedale of Madagascar which are so highly specialized in the structure of their flowers that pollination is limited to one or a very few species of insect, though these are different from the moths with extremely long proboscis which are the pollinating agents for Angraecum. Darwin remarked: 'If such great moths were to become extinct in Madagascar, assuredly the Angraecum would become extinct.' An interesting example of a pollination mechanism helping to maintain specific isolation in a local endemic may be definitely recorded here for the first time. Salvia jurtstcti is limited to a small area in southern Serbia. Morphologically it is very distinct from other species of the genus. The floral feature of interest is that the flowers are inverted 180' or nearly so. When I described the species for the Botanical Magazine (1929), t. 9250, I pointed out that the pollination mechanism was similar to that so often described in text- books for ordinary species of Salvia except that it was upside down. Last summer I grew the species again in the Herbarium Experimental Ground at Kew and made frequent observations on the flowering plants. A honey-bee alights on the structurally upper lip which makes a lower platform, pushes in its proboscis, the stamens emerge below the bee's</page><page sequence="16">220 Some problems of plant range and distribution body, the anthers strike the underside, not the head or back, of the visiting insect, and pollen is carried away in this position. At a later stage the forked stigma will touch the undersurface of a visiting bee in the same place. In nature, cross-pollination and therefore hybridization with other species of Salvia is thus excluded, but two investigators have obtained artificial hybrids between S. jurisicii and S. nemorosa. The F1 had the flowers obliquely placed and was of low fertility. No records of wild hybrids with S. jurisicii for one of the parents are known. Some special modes of nutrition obviously act as marked limiting factors. Parasitism gives many examples. The potential range of a parasite is restricted at least to the actual range of the host or hosts. The narrower the specialization the more is the range limited. One may compare the ranges of Orobanche pinorum parasitic on Abies balsamifera in Oregon and California or Orobanche esulae parasibic on Euphorbia esulae in Serbia and South Macedonia with that of Orobanche minor with nearly a hundred known hosts. It is, however, possible that there are 'races' or 'strains' within this last species with narrower specialization in hosts. Viscum album var. album is parasitic on a very large number of trees and shrubs. Over 160 host species have been recorded for the variety. On the other hand, var. abietis is restricted to firs and var. pini to pines and spruces. There has been great controversy over mycorrhiza, and it must suffice here to say that the absence of suitable mycorrhizal fungi may sometimes be a limiting factor to the spread of range or distribution of a spermatophyte. How far the ranges of orchid species are limited in this way is doubtful. The published evidence is conflicting and the conclusions drawn from some published results do not logically follow. SOME PROBLEMS OF LOCAL DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATIONS WITHIN A RANGE The distribution of paramorphs within a species range raises innumerable problems of interest to the taxonomist, the ecologist, and the geneticist. Extensive field and experi- mental experience with the bladder campions, knapweeds, buttercups, and other genera, has convinced me that species are far more variable than they are given credit or dis- credit for in our floras, and that what shall be considered one species is often best deter- mined only on the basis of scientific convenience. This is not the place to give details of the researches by which these conclusions have been reached but they have to be stated as the background to problems raised here. First, we have the presence of mutations in wild populations. We know relatively little about these, yet the rate of their occurrence, their value in providing new phenotypes for natural selection to act upon, and their cytogenetic behaviour provide the basis of evolu- tion according to current orthodox theory. Field evidence, though very restricted, supports controlled breeding experiments that gene mutations are apparently most often random in the sense that within any one taxon they affect many different organs and many different characters. Many mutations have only been recorded once in the wild. The extraordinary male variant of Ranunculus acris has only been found once, in Cumberland. It is recessive to the normal and reappears in F2 with all the characters intact. In Solanum dulcamara the inflorescence is nearly always many-flowered. A single plant with one-flowered inflorescences and one-fruited infructescences was found in eastern Ireland. It came true from seed and on crossing with a many-flowered plant it was found that the latter was incompletely dominant. Segregation of some plants with clear-cut one-flowered inflorescences occurred in F2 families. Pulicaria dysenterica var. hubbardii,</page><page sequence="17">W. B. TURRILL 221 from near Islip, Oxfordshire, comes true from seed and may possibly belong to the same phenotype as a plant recorded previously from Lincolnshire but not, so far as I could trace, validly named. It breeds true to the varietal characters. The gamotepalous variant of Fritillaria meleagris has been found wild near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, but occurs in cultivation in three colours. In my experience it is always sterile. The var. contorta Baker has white flowers but the wild gamotepalous plant has purple tessellated flowers. It is probable that the mutation for gamotepalous perianths has occurred several times though there is the possibility that-it first occurred as a recessive in a plant heterozygous for colour. The hermaphrodite variant of Bryonia dioica, as grown in the Herbarium Experimental Ground at Kew, comes true from seed for the characters of hermaphrodite flowers. So far as I know it has only been found wild in Lancashire. Berteroa orbiculata is a species native to the Balkan Peninsula (North and South Macedonia, Thrace, Rodope Massif) and northern Asia Minor. A population we examined on one of the Mulyani Islands, to the west of the Athos Peninsula, was composed almost equally of the type variety with densely hairy fruits and the new variety glabra with quite or nearly glabrous fruits (Kew Bull. (1937), p. 222). The fruit variation in Clypeolajonthlaspi has been studied at Kew from living and dried material (Kew Bull. (1935), p. 1 and (1937), p. 224). Attempts have since been made to name paramorphs within the aggregate species but the scheme based on tabulation of characters is more suggestive than lists of intraspecific or micro- specific names. Mutational varieties within taxonomic species may sometimes be of very temporary duration. Such varieties of Silene maritima as that with long cylindric calyx (Kew Bull. (1939), p. 303), cannot survive in the wild beyond a few years, unless there be oft repeated mutation or reappearance of the phenotype from a hidden recessive. On the other hand, some intraspecific mutations, even if very rare in wild populations, can persist for long periods. Myrtus communis var. tarentina was collected by me in Dalmatia in 1925. It was recorded by Pliny, A.D. 23-79 (see Icones Plantarum (1933) t. 3203). The occurrence of paramorphs, the kind and degree of variation within a species, and the distribution of variants within populations have a wider significance than is sometimes realized. Not only are such studies essential before the taxonomist can decide how the material concerned can best be classified but it is only by them that many evolutionary hypotheses based on laboratory or breeding ground experiments, or sometimes on mathe- matical calculations, can be tested. Personally, I hold that field studies should either come before or should be concurrent with controlled experiments. One often wishes that cytogeneticists used material of known wild origin more than they do. The careful mapping of range and distribution of characters throughout the range of a species can give most instructive results. We are trying to do this for British populations of armadillo and tubercled testas in Silene maritima and S. cucubalus, for radiata and eradiata variants in Centaurea nigra (s.l.), and for the occurrence or non-occurrence of axillary tubers in Ranunculusficaria. It is surprising the number of problems one meets. One could under- stand an increase of vegetative multiplication over seed reproduction the more northern the area within the range of Ranunculusficaria. How can one explain that in populations of Silene maritima the seeds are near Aberdeen 100% tubercled, in Jersey 50-90% tubercled, in Sark 100 % tubercled, on the Chesil Beach near Abbotsbury 100 % armadillo, and so on? Armadillo is always recessive to tubercled. Some problems of evolution might be elucidated by a study of aggregate species in dif- ferent stages of a sere. It is probable that the biotypes present may vary from stage to J. Ecol. 39 15</page><page sequence="18">222 Some problems of plant range and distribution stage. On newly made road margins near Yarnton to the north of Oxford we were surprised at the number of paramorphs of Poa pratensis present in 1941-2. The verges were then mown and otherwise treated and in 1945 many of the variants had disappeared entirely. The floristic changes here were artificially controlled and very rapid but they may well be analogous to changes in more natural successions. Apomicts and clones. Genetically, apomicts and clones are equivalent. Ecologically, they are different. Their taxonomic position is chaotic in that different authors have expressed widely different views from genus to genus and even within the same genus. Here we can be concerned only with a few matters connected with their ranges and distributions. Apomicts probably occur more frequently than is realized. There are some genera, such as Hieracium, Taraxacum, and Alchemilla, in which they abound in some floras-indeed they are the rule. In other genera, such as Crepis, they are common. At the other extreme apomixis has been found in Ranunculus acris, in the stocks examined, in less than 1 % of ovules under the most favourable experimental conditions tested (Marsden-Jones &amp; Turrill, 1935). Ecologically, the apomicts of Taraxacum fall into two major groups: those occurring in natural habitats and those occurring as weeds or ruderals. Most intensive studies on both have been made in the countries of northern Europe. The recent work of S0rensen &amp; Gudjonsson (1946) has shown that from some apomicts new chromosomal and morpho- logical apomicts arise very readily, not only in considerable numbers but also the same one repeated. Some of the better differentiated groups of Taraxaca are undoubtedly ecotypes, as those of dense grassland or sand-dunes, but many of those of the aggregate T. officinale are not. Very different opinions have been expressed as to the age of apomicts. Marklund, for southern Finland, concluded that no new 'species' (i.e. apomict micro- species) had originated there since the Ice Age. On the other hand, S0rensen concludes from the results of Christiansen that a differentiation of 'forms' has occurred in Iceland 'perhaps only since the Norse colonization about a thousand years ago'. Apomicts reproduce by seeds and some of them form excellent material for ecological experiments. Taraxacum apomicts, for example, are extremely plastic. Salisbury (1942) has discussed the ecological importance of vegetative multiplication, especially in regard to competition. There is no doubt that it is often a decisive factor in local distributions and plays a part in extending the geographical ranges of some species. Recent, and partly unpublished, investigations with Ranunculus ficaria have raised many problems. In the south and south midland counties of England plants with and others without tubers in the axils of the cauline leaves are both common. The former perhaps favour rather more open and sunny and the latter more shady habitats, but otherwise there appears to be little difference in ecological preferences. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to score this character from herbarium material. Specimens are frequently incomplete or too young, since the axillary tubers may not develop till flowering is finished. Most often diploid plants (2n = 16) have no axillary tubers and tetraploid plants (2n = 32) have them. There are, however, a few known exceptions to this correlation. Some male plants without axillary tubers have 2n = 18, 20, or 21. R. ficaria grandiflorus (Kew stock) without axillary tubers had 2n = 32. This last large-flowered variety is mainly southern in its range and is common in parts of the Mediterranean Region. It is always without axillary tubers, in the many specimens examined. Most continental material of R. ficaria (in addition to R. ficaria grandiftorus) also appear to be without axillary tubers, but specimens with these have been seen from France, Italy, Spain, South Macedonia, and</page><page sequence="19">W. B. TURRILL 223 Istria. Good material is particularly wanted from Scandinavia, the north of England, and Scotland. One might expect that the variant or variants with axillary tubers (var. bulbifera) would extend farther north than plants without. This still remains doubtful. Ecotypes. Variants within a species selected for certain characters by particular habitat conditions within the range of a taxonomic species were termed ecotypes by Turesson. Ecotypes are homozygous for the characters to which they owe their special habitat selection, but may be variable for any other non-selective characters. The ecotype concept is undoubtedly a very useful one in detailed ecological researches as well as in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. My own disagreement with ecotypologists has been concerned not with the ecotype concept itself but with some definitions, especially of ecospecies, and the attempts to limit taxonomic units on a narrow specialized basis with inadequate data. Personally, I should prefer to consider taxa ecotypically rather than to make distinct categories to replace taxa. Let us take a few examples. Cytisus scoparius var. prostratus is a very distinct habit variant limited in the British Isles to coastal areas and obviously adapted to exposed situations. It came true to the remarkable prostrate habit from seed collected in Alderney and grown at Kew. Solanum dulcamara var. marinum is also a genetic variant and an ecotype. On the other hand, Silene maritima and S. cucubalus are best regarded as ecotypically differentiated species. Their habitats are different and the species rarely meet in nature. There are a score or more morphological and physiological normal differences between them. Their intraspecific variations are partly parallel, partly different. Their geographical ranges are different, though they overlap as in the British Isles and the evidence is strongly in favour of their having had different histories here. Further, ecotypes within both S. maritima and S. cucubalus have been recognized, and some of them have been grown at Kew and Potterne and investigated in some detail. Hybrid swarms. The work of the late Dr J. P. Lotsy gave a stimulus to the study of wild hybrid populations. This stimulus had largely spent itself before the subject was taken up again from new viewpoints and by the introduction of some new methods. The subject is of increasing importance since taxonomists are bringing to light many new examples, particularly in tropical floras, which require detailed field and experimental investigation. Orthodox taxonomic methods can reveal the problems and make tentative suggestions for their solution. Proof must come from combined ecological and cytogenetical investiga- tions. This is shown by the researches on Centaurea carried out at Kew and Potterne. Examination of herbarium material, character by character, suggested that hybridization sometimes occurred between certain taxa. Field studies revealed the presence of what appeared to be hybrid swarms between two or more taxonomic species in several English counties. Cytological examination confirmed the possibility or impossibility of certain crosses to give fertile offspring. Very extensive controlled breeding work, involving over six hundred crosses, resulted in the full analysis of hybrids and their re-synthesis from parental species. The researches, which are being prepared for publication, have thrown a flood of light on the composition of wild populations of knapweeds and prove the value of a synthetic approach to the problems of mixed populations. C. scabiosa and C. nigra (s.l.) keep distinct, though often growing together, because they have very different genotypes, including different chromosome numbers. C. jacea and C. nigra (s.l.) when they meet hybridize and back-cross to give complicated hybrid swarms, in which some combinations 15-2</page><page sequence="20">224 Some problems of plant range and distribution and segregations have been described and named as species or varieties while a very large number have (fortunately) remained without names. As already mentioned, the taxo- nomic difficulties met with in the Mediterranean flora in certain genera (as Dianthus, Silene, Thymus, Centaurea, Asperula, Verbascum, and Veronica) are due, at least in part, to the opening up of new habitats by man through forest destruction, the consequent spread in range of taxa adapted (or pre-adapted) to such habitats, the meeting of taxa previously isolated, and hybridization. Evidence is accumulating that very similar situations, with their resultant ecological and taxonomic problems, have arisen and are arising in tropical regions such as Tropical Africa outside the rain-forest areas. There is no doubt that man's influence on the vegetation and flora of Africa has been and continues to be very great indeed. The areas of primitive forest are now limited in extent but the evidence is all in favour of high forests as the natural climaxes over a very great deal of the African land surface below the tree limit, apart from the natural desert and semi- desert zones. Mountains above the tree limit are now of relatively very small total area and the deserts and semi-deserts have themselves been extended by man's activities. A great part of the huge savanna areas (using the term savanna in a very wide sense) has a much modified or secondary vegetation due to deforestation, annual burning, grazing, and other factors of human interference. This raises a whole series of problems regarding the status and origin of the floras. Recent investigations are suggesting that much of the more northern savanna flora is a mixture of old types and new species with many 'species in the making'. All sorts of factors are involved. Survival of forest species, increase in range and distribution of forest-margin and forest-clearing species, selection of fire- resistant taxa, spread of introduced species, and the meeting of previously isolated taxa followed by hybridization and the production of hybrid swarms. In Clematis and in the microgenus Clematopsis the facts as determined by large numbers of herbarium specimens are such as to defy classification by ordinary taxonomic methods and schemes. Not only are there all kinds of combinations of characters and intermediates between what have been called species but hybrid swarms between the two genera (if they be accepted as such) are known in the wild. In Bersama (Melianthaceae) the position is not dissimilar, and one could quickly list a dozen or more other genera where the taxonomic confusion cannot be properly straightened out on the basis of alpha taxonomy alone. Sometimes a mixed population occupies a large area geographically situated between the ranges of two different relatively uniform populations. It is then possible to explain the facts either by supposing the intermediate population to be of hybrid origin or to postulate segregation of the purer populations in two different directions. The best example I have studied in the field is that of the firs in the Balkan Peninsula. Abies alba extends its range from Central Europe into the northern parts of the Balkan Peninsula. The Greek fir, A. cephalonica, occurs in the southern parts. In the Rodope Massif and radiating thence in various directions is a mixed population to which the name A. borisii-regis has been given. Whether this population be older than or younger than A. alba and A. cephalonica cannot yet be determined. Anderson (1949) has given the name 'introgressive hybridization' to the 'gradual infiltra- tion of the germplasm of one species into that of another' through the repeated back- crossing of the hybrids to one or both parents. The whole subject is full of problems for the ecologist, the geneticist, and the taxonomist, and its study leads the investigator to consider most of the fundamentals of evolution.</page><page sequence="21">W. B. TURRILL 225 THE HUMAN FACTOR However much we may revel in studying primitive flora and vegetation, the fact is that the greater part of the land surface of the earth is now occupied by plant-life very greatly influenced by man. To the student of range and distribution two courses are open and both should be followed. First, to do all he can to have preserved as much of the remaining natural primitive flora and vegetation as possible. Secondly, not to despise the more or less artificially produced results of man's behaviour and misbehaviour in relation to the vegetable kingdom. The Garden of Eden was no doubt a botanists' paradise before Adam delved and Eve span and the potentialities of the Tree of Knowledge had resolved them- selves into the destruction of so much that is good and beautiful. We can only deal with what remains. How far and how quickly flora and vegetation would return to a primitive make up if man were exterminated may be an academic question. Very restricted experi- ments combined with observations of areas discarded by man suggest that a partial return often occurs with surprising rapidity but that a complete return would only happen after periods of geological time. Man has perhaps exterminated very few species of plants. Astragalus physocalyx was endemic to a hill at Philippopolis in South Bulgaria. The hill has now been built over and so far as is known the species is extinct in the wild. Most often relicts of the primitive flora still exist within or not too far away from or too isolated from areas of secondary succession. Normal dispersal brings them back where establishment has become possible. Of course, essential stages in a secondary sere cannot be jumbled or jumped. Hence the problems of time lag. For example, if the Mediterranean Region were cleared and kept cleared of man and his domesticated animals nearly the whole land surface up to the tree limit would become forest again but the time taken for this to happen would vary enormously. Where soil remains there would be high forest within one to two centuries. Where erosion has exposed large expanses of bare rock a millennium might be needed to make the habitat suited for high climax forest. For tropical forests, authors are not unanimous in their statements regarding the continued distinctions between primary and secondary forest. Some state that, for example, derelict clearings of shifting cultivation more or less quickly revert to a 'primitive' condition, others say that secondary forest remains permanently distinguishable from primary forest. In many parts of the world man has added greatly to the flora. How far would his intro- ductions survive were he removed? No doubt the vast majority of introductions would disappear, like the wheat of the Broadbalk Wilderness at Rothamsted. A few more would probably survive indefinitely either because they found the climax conditions such that they could compete on survival terms with native species or because by mutation and selection they became so adapted. It may be suggested that in the British Isles sycamore among trees, Rhododendron ponticum among shrubs, and Juncus tenuis among herbs could survive indefinitely. Oakwoods with undergrowth of Rhododendron ponticum, as at Burnham Beeches, recall very closely the native woods in the Stradja mountains of eastern Bulgaria and eastern Thrace. At least we learn, in reverse of the orthodox truism, that ranges depend on dispersal as well as on establishment. That human influences on plant life last a very long time is shown by air photographs of prehistoric sites. Striking examples have been exhibited at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and no doubt elsewhere also. Entirely to eliminate such influences certainly requires periods of geological not of archaeological time.</page><page sequence="22">226 Some problems of plant range and distribution Man's influence has been most marked on the land flora. He has, however, greatly modified large areas of marsh and smaller areas of open fresh water by drainage. The elimination of Lake Kopais in Greece is a good example. The history of the introduction and rapid spread of Elodea canadensis is well known. Members may be interested to learn that it is still extending its range in south-east Europe. E. callitrichoides has recently been recorded in the Longford and Colne rivers. Human influence on the marine flora has been much less spectacular. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 led to the spread of some sea plants. Thus Halophila sthp ideea has extended its range from the Red Sea to the environs of Rhodes, Syra, Samos, and the Piraeus (Turrill, 1930). Aleem (1948) records six marine algae of Indo-Pacific ranges that have spread into the eastern Mediterranean Sea presumably through the Suez Canal. Enough, it is hoped, has now been said to suppbrt the, thesis that the study of range and distribution reveals innumerable problems that are worth the attention of ecologists, cytogeneticists, and taxonomists. An attempt has been made to place a few of these problems before you so that you may realize what wide vistas of research remain little explored. In particular, it is desirable that we should remain sceptical regarding statements that imply that solutions for all problems have been found, perhaps by way of age and area, or through continental drift, or by some other hypothesis. It is, moreover, worth considering whether some theories have not been wrangly placed as opposites, one to be accepted and one to be rejected. Thus, what are now widely discontinuous ranges may be due partly to dispersal jumps and partly to former connexions that have now disappeared. It would be of very great interest to have a careful calculation of the minimal land connexions required by phytogeographers to explain cross-oceanic range discon- tinuities. In this survey of some problems of range and distribution a number of practical sug- gestions have been made which it may be useful to summarize: (1) The degree of effectiveness of dispersal agencies for disseminules (diaspores) remains an open question. Botanists should arrange to co-operate with ornithologists and with those engaged in exploration of the atmosphere to reinvestigate the possibilities of long- distance bird and wind dispersal, especially in so far as these may explain range dis- continuities. (2) Every possible encouragement should be given to the full investigation of fossil angiosperm floras. (3) Distribution problems should be examined by the synthetic methods of the so-called new systematics. In every flora there are many species or small groups of species awaiting intensive investigation by combined field observation, experimental ecology and genetics, anatomical and cytological laboratory examination, and comparative taxonomy.
