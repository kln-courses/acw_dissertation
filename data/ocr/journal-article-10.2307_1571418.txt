NAFI Oxfordshire Early mentions of Ibrahim ibn Hasan al-Kufrani (1025 AH/1616- 1101 AH/1689) in modern scholarship on Islamic intellectual history characterized him as a suifi teacher.1 Investigating the significance of a treatise on tasawwuf, al-Tuhfa al-Mursala ild Ruh al-Nabi, written by the Indian sufi Muhammad Fadl-Allah al-Burhanbfiri (d. 1619), A. H. Johns found that the Madina-based al-Kurani was closely asso- ciated with Southeast Asian Islamic revival in the seventeenth cen- tury, particularly with the Achehnese teacher 'Abd al-Ra'uf (d. 1690). Later, Johns located a manuscript of al-Kufrani's original commen- tary on al-Tuhfa, in which he defended the suifi principal of wahdat al-wujud (the unity of existence).2 Another twist in our understand- ing of al-Kuirani came to the surface when John Voll published a short but highly important article,3 identifying a group of revivalist culama' centered on the Hijazi holy city of Madina during the sev- enteenth and early eighteenth centuries, with an extensive network of associates and students in other parts of the Muslim world.

NAFI prominent among the first generation of this group of 'ulama' were Ahmad al-Qushashi and Muhammad al-Babili; the second included their students Ibrahim ibn Hasan al-Kurani, 'Abdullah ibn Salim al- Basri and Hasan b. 'All al-'Ujaymi, who in turn were teachers of a larger group that comprised, among others of the third generation, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Kurani (Ibrahim's son) and Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi. While members of this circle of 'ulama' originated from various regions of the Muslim world, their students and disciples came from and spread to Persia, Algeria, the Arabian Pen- insula, India, Syria, Algeria and elsewhere. These 'ulama', who be- longed to various Sunni schools of fiqh, were almost all affiliates of sufi tariqas, including Khalwatiyya, Naqshbandiyya, Shadhiliyya, Suh- rawardiyya, Shattariyya and Qadiriyya, and were universally interested in hadith scholarship. Since several of the late-eighteenth-century Islamic reformists, most prominently Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab (1703-92) and Wali-Allah Dihlawi (1703-62), had been associated with scholars of the Madinan circle, the implication of Voll's findings was that the origins of the eighteenth-century Islamic revivalism had much deeper roots and were the culmination of a long process of intellectual evolution and change. This should raise some questions about the position of Ibrahim al-Kurani in this process of intellectual evolu- tion. The most vexing of all questions is how it could have been possible that a scholar of profound sffi affiliation and belief in wahdat al-wujud be genealogically related to a robust salafi and anti-sufi like Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab. Although Voll did not study the intellectual making of al-Kfrani or any of his numerous treatises and books,4 basing his conclusions on the study of chains of authority, he sug- gested that al-Kfrani, and the whole phenomenon of revivalist tasaw- wuf in the eighteenth century, was influenced by and influential in a rising interest in hadith scholarship. As an intellectual development in the intellectual history of Islam, "sufi revivalism/reformism", or "neo-sufism", was first proposed by 4 For a list of al-Kurani's works, which exceeded perhaps fifty books and short treatises, see Isma'il al-Baghdadi, Hadiyat al-'Ariftn, Asma' al-Mu'allifin wa-Athar al- Musannifin (Istanbul: n p., 1955-57), vol. 1, columns, 35-6; C.

Relying on a small body of evidence, De Jong, and O'Fahey and Radtke, questioned the whole assumption of an intellectual change and reform in eighteenth-century sulfism.7 The problem, of course, is that if the dismissal argument is accepted, how exactly can 5 Fazul Rahman, Islam (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1966), 206.

One of the main problems of De Jong's evaluation of al- Bakri's convictions was his reliance on a small sample of al-Bakri's writings, which makes his findings highly inconclusive. O'Fahey and Radtke, on the other hand, dismissed the "neo-sufism" hypothesis by analyzing textual evidence of a small number of African and Middle Eastern sufis. Later, however, Professor O'Fahey qualified his earlier conclusions. In an unpublished paper, indicating the jointly written paper he published with Radke in which they rejected the neo-sufism the- sis, he wrote " In our enthusiasm to demolish the neo-suifi discourse of the colonial scholar/administrator uncritically inherited by such scholars as Hamilton Gibb, Fazlur Rahman and Anne-Marie Schimmel, I believe we went a little too far."

NAFI we explain the making of Ahmad Sirhindi and Wali-Allah Dihlawi, whose suifi roots and powerful reformist tendencies cannot be de- nied? When a scholar like Ibrahim al-Kfurani is perceived by a succession of students and 'ulama' in reformist terms, even two hundred years after his death, can we still dismiss his reformist cre- dentials? Besides attempting to provide some answers to these questions, this article will endeavor to project the intellectual profile of Ibrahim al-Kurani and seek to pinpoint his sources of inspiration. An ubiq- uitous 'alim/teacher with a long-lasting impact, al-Kurani's life and career provide a vital key to the complex relationship between tasaw- wuf and reformist thought. Although the main aim here is to ex- plore the making and some of the influential works of al-Klurani, this study is also about mapping out the intellectual environment of the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries Haramayn, which, as a major Islamic crossroad, seem to have become a melting pot for ideas and intellectual currents originating elsewhere. The significance of al-Kiurani is not, therefore, only seen in his own words but also in the vocations of his students and disciples. In the light of the continuing debate among students of eigh- teenth century Islam about "sufi revivalism" and "neo-suifism", how- ever, it is perhaps important to mention that this article is not about any specific sufi tariqa, but rather about individual 'ulama' (some may have been more committed to tasawwuf than others), who were loosely linked in informal, traditional educational relationships. Whether the phenomenon of "neo-suifism" did exist in the eigh- teenth century Muslim world or not, the assumption underlining this article is that dominant intellectual modes were being reformu- lated within certain 'ulama' circles. Reformist and/or revivalist, the terms used here to describe these trends, are interchangeable and indicate in principal intellectual change and transformation. This article is, thus, not particularly concerned with whether this pheno- menon resulted in broad social, organizational and political changes, which De Jong and O'Fahey assumed, in various degrees, to be as- sociated with revivalist tasawwuf in the eighteenth century, although some of these changes were no doubt closely related to cases of intellectual transformation. In addition, throughout this article the 310</page><page sequence="5">TASAWWUF AND REFORM IN PRE-MODERN ISLAMIC CULTURE 311 term "traditional" is used to denote the dominant Islamic cultural mode in the pre-modern era. Generally speaking, "traditional" here indicates an intellectual orientation that is based on adherence to the established fiqhi madhhabs, Ash'ari or Maturidi theology and tasawwuf. Seventeenth-Century Madina and its 'ulama' Al-Haramayn, the two grand mosques of the two holy cities of Makka and Madina, have always been centers of Islamic learning, attracting established, as well as aspiring, 'ulama' from all parts of the Muslim world. The yearly Hajj season, the holiness of the two cities and the slow and arduous means of communication, encour- aged seekers of knowledge to stay at the Haramayn for various pe- riods of time; some would even settle there permanently. Being the seat of the ashraf, the local rulers of the Hijaz, Makka was a more recognized centre of learning during the period following the Ot- toman conquest of the Arab East in the sixteenth century. Signifi- cant improvements in the security of the Hajj routes, brought about by strong Ottoman rule, together with the increase in the number of waqfs dedicated for the maintenance of the Haramayn,8 engen- dered a period of prosperity in the Hijaz. The move of the eminent Egyptian Shafi'i 'alim Ahmad ibn Hajar al-Haythami (909/1504-974/ 1567) from Cairo to Makka in the thirties of the sixteenth century coincided with the rising position of the city, and helped to establish a school of learning that influenced a wide range of 'ulama', not only in the Arab East but also in areas as far as the Indian subcon- tinent.9 During the seventeenth century, however, the political in- stability, caused by the ongoing conflict within ranks of the ruling 8 On the Ottoman effort to improve the security of the Hajj routes and places, see Suraiya Faroqhi, Pilgrims and Sultans: The Hajj under the Ottomans (London: I.

The first renowned 'alim to be associated with Madina in the second half of the seventeenth century was shaykh Ahmad b. Mu- hammad al-Qushashi (also known as al-Qushash; 991/1583-1071/ 1661).10 Al-Qushashi hailed from the Badris of Jerusalem, a family with sharifian descent, whose roots in the city went back to the sev- enth Hijri century.11 It was his father, an 'alim as well, who first moved from Jerusalem to Madina for unclear reasons. Ahmad al-Qushashi received his early education from his father, accompanying him to Yemen in 1011/1602-3, where he joined several circles of its emi- nent 'ulama' at the time. An unpleasant experience led him to leave his father behind and return to Madina where he encountered the prominent sufi shaykh Ahmad b. 'Ali al-Shinnawi (known also as al- Khami; 975/1568-1028/1619),12 who initiated al-Qushashi into the sutfi way. Al-Hamawi reported, perhaps with some exaggeration, that al-Qushashi accompanied more than a hundred stfi shaykhs, and following the ethos of his times was an associate of several tariqas, including the Qadiriyya, Shattariyya and the Shadhiliyya, establish- ing himself firmly in the dominant sufi milieu of the seventeenth century and becoming the successor of al-Shinnawi in Madina.13 Al- Qushashi seems to have been extremely charismatic, humble, pious and an immensely effective teacher, traits that explain the large 10 Muhammad Amin al-Muhibbi, Khulasat al-Atharfi A'y n al-Qarn al-Hadd 'Ashar (Beirut: Maktabat Khayiat, n. d.), vol. 1, 343-6; Yfisuf Illiyas Sarkis, Mu'jam al-Matbu'at al-'Arabiyya wal-Mu'araba (Cairo: Maktabat al-Thaqafa al-Diniyya, n. d.), vol. 2, col- umn, 1513; Yusuf al-Nabahani, Jami' Karamat al-Awliya', ed.

The problem, however, is how to define Ahmad al-Qusha- shi's position in the course of Islamic reformist currents of the pre- modern period. Intellectual reform implies renewal, breaking of cultural impasse, challenge to dominant intellectual modes and instilling vitality into a stagnant cultural situation. By the seventeenth century, Islamic culture had already succumbed to the pervasive influence of sufi tariqas and madhhabi fiqh, where middle Islamic traditions eclipsed the founding Islamic texts of the Qur'an and hadith, imitation in the form of commentary and glosses replaced the creative enterprises in fiqh and theology, and sufi popular beliefs and practices became normative even among the highest class of the 'ulama'.14 Moreover, wahdat al-wujud, the doctrinal edifice of sufi theology, which had been accepted with reservations by some 'ulama' in earlier periods, was now widely held and defended. Although a systematic assessment of Islamic intellectual reformism is still lacking, students of early modern Islamic history largely agree that Islamic reformists expres- sed themselves in terms of ijtihad, re-assertion of the position of the Qur'an and hadith, upholding the tenets of high religion and affir- mation of tawhid, either by re-interpreting the doctrine of wahdat al-wujad or by totally rejecting it.15 An emphasis on one or more of these themes would, thus, indicate the presence of reformist tenden- cies. Ahmad al-Qushashi was, as al-Muhibbi put it, "the imam of all those who believed in wahdat al-wujiud", and his writings were mainly glosses and commentaries on major sufi tracts. He was certainly regarded as one of the greatest safis of his times, but what he struggled to bequeath to his students was an extension of what he inherited from 14 Rahman, Islam, 153. For a study of the incorporation of popular tasawwuf into the major sufi tariqa during the thirteenth to sixteenth cenuries, see Ahmet T. Karamustafa, God's Unruly Friends (Salt Lake City: The University of Utah Press, 1994). 15 For various aspects of the discussion of these issues, see Rudolph Peters, "Idjtihad and Taqlid in 18th and 19th Century Islam", Die Welt des Islam, XX, 3-4 (1980): 132-45.

Al-Qushashi sought, to the best of his abilities, to maintain traditions of tasawwuf and to safeguard a line of learning and mystical vocation. Yet, he was also greatly and unusually interested in theology, on which he compiled three treatises discussing the question of kasb, or acquisition, one of the principal concepts of the Ash'ari doctrine, which exercised deep influence on his students, and on the account of one treatise, at least, he invited some controversy.16 The Azhari shaykh Muhammad b. 'Ala' al-Din al-Babili (1000/ 1592-1077/1666),17 was a no less celebrated 'alim, though in a dif- ferent manner and capacity. Al-Babili arrived to al-Azhar from his village of Babil, near Cairo, at four years of age, and was fortunate to receive his early education of fiqh, hadith and the Arabic lan- guage from some of the most eminent 'ulama' of Cairo at the time, including al-Nfur al-Zayyadi, 'All al-Halabi, 'Abd al-Ra'uf al-Munawi, al-Burhan al-Laqqani and Abu al-Naja Salim al-Sanhuri. With more than twenty teachers behind him, 1-Babili was recognized by his contemporaries as a highly established 'alim with extensive knowl- edge; yet, it was his undisputed erudition in hadith that attracted to him a wide range of students from various parts of the Arab mashriq. His ascetic mode of life and avoidance of worldly attractions, avail- able to scholars of his stature, took him to several pilgrimage jour- neys and to a ten-years sojourn in Makka where he again became a focal point for seekers of learning, particularly hadith scholarship. It was most likely during his stay in Makka that al-Babili came in touch with the vibrant group of Madinan 'ulama'. The question is what role could al-Babili have played in the making of the Madinan circle? A keen teacher rather than a writer, al-Babili left only one trea- tise, Kitab al-Jihad, which he was encouraged to compose by the Ottoman wali of Egypt at the time. The sort of book that an 'alim would write when the Ottoman state was at war or the local admin- istration fighting against dissidents, Kitdb al-Jihad cannot provide a window to the intellectual affinities of Muhammad al-Babili.

Had he not been a scholar of hadith, a fundamental criterion in the assessment of Islamic revivalist currents, al-Babili's association with the Haramayn cultural environment would have been an insignificant event, at least in the context of pre-modern Islamic revivalism. Later ijazas of Ottoman 'ulama' confirm the posi- tion of al-Babili in the chains of hadith transmission. These ijazas, however, indicate that hadith scholarship was a vibrant pursuit in Cairo from the time of Ahmad b. Hajar al-'Asqalani (d. 1449) on- ward, with uninterrupted chains of transmission,18 a fact which made Cairo a major centre of hadith learning, perhaps well into the mid- nineteenth century. It is, therefore, necessary to distinguish between two types of hadith scholarship: the transmission of hadith collec- tions, and the textual study of hadith (the study of matn), or the direct return to the hadith (besides the Qur'an) as a source of the shari'a, an approach that had been validated by al-Shafi'i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal in the third Hijri century. It is clear that the late eighteenth century reformists, including Wali-Allah Dihlawi, Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab, and the less known Muhammad Murtada al-Zabidi, were all interested in hadith scholarship, not only in its dissemination and transmission but prin- cipally in its substantive study as a primary textual source of religion and shari'a. In his biography of al-Zabidi, al-Jabarti was unequivocal in depicting his teacher's textualist approach to hadith as revolu- tionary and refreshing, an approach that set al-Zabidi apart from 18 See, in historical order, Ahmad ibn Hajar al-Haythami, "Masasid al-Haythami", ms. 2014, Tarikh, Institute of Arab Manuscripts, The Arab League, Cairo; several ijazas granted from Cairene 'ulama' to shaykh Sharaf al-Din ibn 'Usayla in the late sixteenth century, ms. 3490, Majmu'at, Dar al-Kutub, Cairo; eight ijazas granted to Shaykh Salih ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazzi al-Tamartashi, ms. 23839 B, Dar al-Kutub, Cairo; Ijaza from Muhammad ibn Sultan al-Shafi'i al-Walidi to Isma'il al- Jarahi al-'Ajluni, ms. 97, Hadith Taymur, Dar al-Kutub, Cairo; "Twenty one Ijazas Granted to Isma'il al-Jarahi al-'Ajluni", ms. 97, Hadith Taymur, Dar al-Kutub, Cairo; 'Ali ibn Ahmad al-Sa'idi al-'Adawi, "Thabt al-'Adawi", ms. 23328 B, Dar al-Kutub, Cairo.</page><page sequence="10">BASHEER M. NAFI the rest of the 'ulama' of Cairo.19 It was this common denominator in the orientation of the well-known late-eighteenth century reform- ists that suggested the close association between the rising interest in hadith scholarship and the emergence of reformist tendencies. Al-Babili was one of a few scholars who committed themselves to the study of hadith as a text since Ahmad b. Hajar al-'Asqalani and al- Suyuti. Al-Muhibbi, opening his biography of al-Babili, wrote, "He was the most knowledgeable of all his contemporaries in the matns of hadith."20 Although there was nothing conspicuously clear about his reformist tendencies, al-Babili was, in a subtle manner, critical of the intellectual mode of his time. When asked why he was not interested in writing, like the rest of his prominent fellow 'ulama', he said "one should only compile a book in something that has never been tackled before, or in something incomplete that he seeks to conclude, or in something ambiguous in order to clarify it, or in something that is so expansive in order to summaries it without blemishing its meaning, or in something so sundry in order to re- organize it, or in something mistaken in order to correct it, or in something so disperse in order to bring it together."21 The third of this group of 'ulama', who came to shape the Ma- dinan intellectual environment in the late seventeenth century, was a polymath, hadith scholar and a sifi. Muhammad b. Sulayman al- Maghribi (1037/1628-1094/1683)22 was born in a village near Slus of the Far Maghrib and studied in Marrakech and Algeria with some of the most prominent Malikis, including the renowned shaykh Sa'id b. Ibrahim,23 the mufti of Algeria. Subsequently, al-Maghribi trav- eled to Cairo where he joined the circles of al-Ajhfiri, Sultan al- Mazahi and the hadith scholar, Ahmad al-Shubari. He then moved to the Hijaz where, as he began to teach, he continued to study with '9 'Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, Tarrkh 'Aja'ib al-Athdrfi l-Tardjim wal-Akhbdr (Beirut: Dar al-Jil, n. d.), vol. 2, 103-14. 20 Al-Muhibbi, Khuldsat al-Athdr, vol. 4, 39.

His pronounced suifi affinities were first nurtured by Muhammad b. Nasir al-Dir'i,24 who revived the fortunes of the Shadhiliyya ttariqa in seventeenth century Morocco. Besides his acclaimed scholarly knowledge of hadith and fiqh, as well as ma- thematics, geometry, astrology and music, shaykh Muhammad b. Sulayman al-Maghribi was a goldsmith, inventor and bookbinder, skills that helped him earn his living and maintain a detached mode of life. In 1668, a year of severe drought and hardship in the Hijaz, he, along with the other Maghribi 'ulama' of Madina, 'Isa b. Muham- mad al-Tha'alibi and 'Abd al-Rahman al-Maghribi, took the initiative to raise funds from the wealthy in order to support the badly off and the impoverished.25 Three years later, Muhammad b. Sulayman al-Maghribi was invited to Istanbul to meet with the grand vezir, Ahmad Pasha Koprullu (grand vezir from 1661-76),26 the second of the great K6prfillu ministers of the Ottoman Sultanate, after be- friending a brother of his during the pilgrimage season. Al-Maghribi stayed a whole year as a guest of Ahmad Pasha, strik- ing a profound relationship with the enlightened grand vezir who admired the wisdom, erudition and reformist outlook of the shaykh. His visit to Istanbul and his closeness to Ahmad Pasha, the second most powerful man in the sultanate, enabled him to realize three main objectives. First, against a background of chaotic political situ- ation in Makka, al-Maghribi intervened on behalf of sharif Barakat ibn Abi Nummayy (ruled 1672-82), who was apparently well known to al-Maghribi, to replace his relative Sa'd b.

NAFI during the celebration of the Prophet's birthday. Although a sufi and adherent to the Shadhiliyya tariqa, al-Maghribi was uncompro- mising in his opposition to sufi excesses, an attitude that reflected a continuous tension within sffi circles between two frames of mean- ing, the popular ways of tariqas' saints and the suffi 'ulama's struggle to uphold the tenets of religion.27 But while most of the 'ulama' felt swamped by the popular sentiments and the huge following of the saints, a few had enough sense of confidence and authority to speak out. Third, was his appointment to the guardianship of the Hara- mayn waqfs, immediately after his return from Istanbul in 1672. This powerful position and the large resources that come with it, together with the deep understanding between him and sharif Barakat, made shaykh al-Maghribi one of the most influential officials in the Hijaz and enabled him to embark upon a period of public construction in the Haramayn and to become an effective agent in directing the government affairs of the Hijaz. An 'alim, however, was not supposed to cross the long-established line separating the men of knowledge from the men of the sword and to come so close to the circles of power. Moreover, al-Maghribi was a kind of puritan and an idealist calim who was described by a sympathetic observer of the period as "unacquainted with his times",28 an allusion to his unpreparedness to compromise with opponents and detractors. For his reform-ori- ented management of the waqfs, al-Maghribi seems to have antago- nized many quarters in the Haramayn. Hence, immediately after the death of his patron, Ahmad Pasha Koprulu, Kara Mustafa Pasha, the new grand vezir, removed him from the guardianship of the Haramayn waqfs in 1087/1676 and ordered him "not to interfere in matters of the state". Al-Maghribi, however, continued from be- hind the scene to influence the running of the Hijazi affairs through his friend, sharif Barakat. Late in 1682, following the death of sharif 27 A similar response to sufi excesses was raging in Istanbul at the time, expressed by the Kadizadeli movement. On the Kadizadelis, see Madeline C.

Yet, the temptations of power would always be strong for those 'ula- ma' with a reformist drive, and would recurrently be manifested in their attempts to reshape the world in their own image. Al-Maghribi's influence, however, transcended that brief period of his involvement in public affairs, for he was essentially a teacher with a large num- ber of students who sought him not only for learning hadith and fiqh but also mathematics and astrology. His written works were equally influential, the most important of which was Kitab al-Jam' Bayn al-Kutub al-Khamsa wal-Muwatta', where he attempted to present the six major Sunni sources of hadith in one book, an endeavor that reflected his mastery of hadith scholarship and his view of his own mission. The uncompromising, puritanical style of al-Maghribi was in sharp contrast with his fellow Moroccan and hadith scholar, 'Isa b. Muham- mad al-Tha'alibi (1020/1611-1080/1669),3? the affable fourth of the most influential Haramayn 'ulama' at the time, and resident of Ma- dina. His educational background, largely similar to al-Maghribi's, was particularly shaped by two great scholars of hadith matns, 'Ali al-Siglmasi,31 whom he accompanied for ten years, and Muhammad al-Babili, whom he met in Makka. Although his earlier training in hadith scholarship was impeccable, it was in Madina that al-Tha'ali- bi's interest in hadith was to grow to a new height,32 emerging as 29 For the event of his removal and exile, see al-'Isami, Samt al-Nujum al-'Awdal, vol. 4, 538-9 and 543-4; Dahlan, Khulasat al-Kaldm, 102-3.

NAFI one of the most sought scholars of hadith in the Haramayn. Al- Tha'alibi, although he belonged to an environment that was dominated by Shadhiliyya sufi traditions, joined the Naqshbandiyya- Mujaddidiyya through Muhammad al-Ma'sfm, son of Ahmad Sir- hindi,33 with whom the Mujaddidiyya branch of Naqshbandiyya is associated, during al-Ma'sufm's stay in the Hijaz for the Hajj. Al-Tha'alibi was perhaps one of the first of the Madinan group of 'ulama' to espouse the reformist vision of the Naqshbandiyya-Mu- jaddidiyya. In Madina, al-Tha'alibi closely identified with al-Qushashi and shared with him a number of students. Each of these four 'ulama' brought to the Haramayn intellectual milieu a peculiar strand of thought and experience. But all shared a suifi background, although expressed in different styles, a common interest in hadith scholarship, and all were aware of each other's experience and ideas, communicating between themselves and with- in a pool of disciples and students. All, too, were motivated by embryonic reformist elements, either of theological, social or sufi outlook. The importance of al-Qushashi, however, lay in his highly charismatic influence, which enabled him, out of his peers, to rise above the traditional affiliations to fiqhi madhhabs and sufi tariqas, and to emerge as a teacher of shari'a and theology as well as a lead- ing sutfi shaykh in his own right. Devotion and charismatic influence, combined with the power of traditional knowledge, helped al-Qusha- shi to leave behind a school with a strong sense of belonging, "com- panions of al-Qushashi" as an observer called them,34 in which loyalty was no longer to a specific tariqa or madhhab but rather to the memory and authority of the founder. Yet, despite his charismatic command, profound sufi credentials and large following, attributes that would usually give rise to a new sufi brotherhood or at least a branch of an established tariqa, al-Qushashi's circle did not evolve as such. This was either because of his emphatic projection of his role as a mere guide rather than sufi leader, or because the shift in 33 Al-'Aiyashi, al-Rihla, vol. 1, 207-8. 34 A visitor to Madina in the twelfth Islamic century noted how al-Qushashi's companions, led by Ibrahim al-Kurani, behaved as an exclusive group during a re- ligious festival in the city.

The Formation and Emergence of al-Kurani Disciples of al-Qushashi were numerous, but it was Ibrahim ibn Hasan al-Kturani who was the most outstanding amongst them all.35 A Shafi'i 'calim, al-Kiurani was born in the Kurdish town of Shahrazur where he also received his early education. Apparently at a young age, he left his hometown for Baghdad, the point of attraction for aspiring Kurdish 'ulama' during the Ottoman period. Al-Kfurani stayed in Baghdad for two years, then moved to Damascus where he spent a further four years, and to Cairo in 1061/1650 for a shorter period of time, attending various circles of learning in the three cities. Among the most prominent of his teachers in the formative period were Muhammad Sharif al-Kfurani in Baghdad, 'Abd al-Baqi al-Hanbali and Najm al-Din al-Ghazzi in Damascus, and Sultan al-Mazahi in Cairo. Al-Kfurani became fluent in Ottoman Turkish through his association with Turkish 'ulama' in Baghdad, butJohns' suggestion that he also attended learning centers in Istanbul is doubt- ful. Al-Kfurani reached Madina at the end of a pilgrimage journey, where he eventually met Ahmad al-Qushashi, the most influential of all his teachers, and where he finally settled. Al-Kfurani's account of al-Qushashi, as well as al-Muhibbi's biography of him, speaks of special affinity between the two men that went beyond the typical teacher-student relationship, leading to al-Kurani's marriage to the daughter of his teacher and to his designation as al-Qushashi's heir. It was certainly a relationship that combined both sufi and traditional learning elements. Yet al-Kirani's close association with al-Qushashi did not preclude him from seeking knowledge with other 'ulama' in Madina, especially Muhammad al-Babili and 'Isa al-Thacalibi. 35 Muhammad Khalil al-Muradi, Silk al-Durar ft A'yan al-Qarn al-Thanz 'Ashar (Baghdad: Maktabat al-Muthanna, n.d.), vol. 1, 5-6; Muhammad ibn 'All al-Shawkani, al-Badr al-Tali' bi-Mahasin man Ba'd al-Qarn al-Sabi' (Cairo: Matba'at al-Sa'ada, 1348 AH), vol. 1, 11-13; al-'Aiyashi, al-Rihla, vol. 1,320-8; al-Hamawi "Fawa'id al-Irtihal", vol. 1, pp. 44-66; al-Kattani, Fihris al-Faharis, vol. 1, 116-8, 208, 493-4; al-Zirikli, al- A'ldm, vol. 1, 35; EI 2, s. v.

NAFI Al-Kfurani's thabt, or index, of his teachers and chains of learning, although not comprehensive and written eleven years before his death, illustrates the unusual breadth of his erudition.36 His studies of hadith comprised all major, in addition to a large number of the minor, collections of hadith, the Arabic language, fiqh, theology, sufism, and even history. There are some peculiar aspects to his educational background that would not appear in many other ijazas and indexes of his times. First, for a Shafi'i 'alim, his study of fiqh was not limited to Shafi'i texts, not even to Shafi'i and Hanafi, the two dominant madhhabs in the region, but also to Maliki and Han- bali schools of fiqh. Furthermore, his study of Hanbali texts in Damas- cus included also the works of Ibn Taymiyya and his student Ibn al-Qayyim.37 Second, in addition to studying the common Ash'ari and Maturidi texts, his training in theology covered Kitab ftiqdd al- Shd'fi' of 'Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi, and Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad of al- Bukhari, both regarded as salafi books of theology, expressing ideas that are not necessarily in accord with the dominant Ash'ari-Maturidi modes of theology among the Sunni culama' at the time.38 Although 'ulamatic indexes are not usually the sort of books in which specific arguments are advanced, al-Kurani, when listing sources of his study of theology, made a clear mention of his belief in "following the righteous salaf of the umma, and avoiding (in relation to God's attri- butes) metaphorical interpretation (ta'wl) and anthropomorphism (tashbih)", a statement that fits a salafi/Hanbali rather than a stfi/ Ash'ari discourse. Third, in a diversion dealing with the meaning of a hadith in which the Prophet is relayed to have said, "Seeking the truth is alienation (talab al-haqq ghurba) ", al-Kfirani referred approv- ingly to Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani and his attack on the extreme sufi interpretation of the Prophet's statement. By and large, suifis pro- jected the Prophetic hadith as indicating that self-annihilation is a pre-condition for reaching the stage of divine revelation, which is the gate to proper knowledge.39 By rejecting the esoteric approach 36 Ibrahim ibn Hasan al-Kuirani, "al-Imam li-Iqaz al-Himam", ms. 504, Majmu'at Tal'at, Dar al-Kutub, Cairo. 7 Ibid., plate, 43. 38 Ibid., plates, 10-12 and 16. 39 Ibid., plate 51. 322</page><page sequence="17">TASAWWUF AND REFORM IN PRE-MODERN ISLAMIC CULTURE 323 to the text, an essential part of the suifi methodology, al-Kuirani de- fined the side on which he stood in the cultural divide between orthodoxy and esoteric sulfism Later assessments of al-Kuirani's intellectual affinities reveal a high- ly complex career and varying achievements. Nu'man al-Alusi, the Iraqi salafi 'alim, writing in the late nineteenth century, spoke of al- Kurani as an eminent salafi, a defender of Ibn Taymiyya and of salafi beliefs.40 In contrast, 'Abd al-Mut'al al-Sa'idi, in his classic study of the renewers of Islam, while not denying the notable achievements of al-Kulrani, expressed strong misgivings over his salafi affinities and characterized him as an apologist for tasawwuf and the doctrine of wahdat al-wujutd.41 The conflicting appraisals of al-Kuirani, also im- plied in Johns' and Voll's studies, emanate from the complexity of his legacy and the position he occupied in the development of the pre-modern Islamic revivalist thought. Throughout the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Ibn Taymiyya was the subject of ferocious attacks from sufi and tradi- tional 'ulamatic circles, the last of which came from Ibn Hajar al- Haythami in Makka,42 which seemed to have sealed the fate of Ibn Taymiyya's legacy for the next hundred years at least. For his own opposition to Ash'ari theology and many aspects of suifism, Ibn Tay- miyya's ideas were particularly anathema to sifis and Ash'ari 'ulama'. Al-Kurani's main Damascene teacher was shaykh 'Abd al-Baqi Taqi al-Din al-Hanbali (d. 1070/1660), the Hanbali mufti of the city and the most eminent Hanbali 'alim of Damascus in the middle of the seventeenth century.

In addition to the notable list of 'ulama' with whom he studied in Cairo, 'Abd al-Baqi joined the circle of shaykh Mar'i b. Yulsuf al-Karmi (d. 1033/1624)44 to study Hanbali fiqh. One of the rare Hanbali 'ulama' to build a recognizable reputation in early Ottoman Cairo, Mar'i al-Karmi was also a biographer and ad- mirer of Ibn Taymiyya with detailed and thorough knowledge of his life and works. That 'Abd al-Baqi al-Hanbali was introduced to Ibn Taymiyya's works through Mar'i al-Karmi is almost certain, for the latter was an active exponent of the grand salafi scholar. Although al-Kurani never listed the specific books of Ibn Taymiyya he studied under 'Abd al-Baqi al-Hanbali, the Damascene scholar, as we shall see, would continue to influence al-Kfurani's view of Ibn Taymiyyya, even after al-Kturani had settled permanently in Madina. Al-Hamawi, himself a student of al-Kuirani, who came to Madina in 1083/1672,45 about ten years after the passing of al-Qushashi and his succession by al-Kulrani, relays an incident that apparently had taken place prior to his arrival and that left a deep impact on the cultural milieu of the Haramayn. According to al-Hamawi, a fierce debate over the teachings of the Indian Naqshbandi reformer, Ah- mad Sirhindi (1564-1624), erupted in the Haramayn in the late eleventh Hijri century and led to dividing the 'ulama' of Makka and Madina into two opposing camps. The distribution of copies of Sir- hindi's maktubdt (Letters; the form in which he laid out his views) in the Hijaz, and the dissemination of his ideas by followers of his school of thought, engendered an unprecedented polemics in the Hara- mayn, especially among the Persian-speaking 'ulama' who had the opportunity to read Sirhindi's writings in its original form. Muham- mad al-Barzanji (1040/1630-1103/1691),46 another Kurdish 'alim and a main figure among al-Qushashi's students, vehemently at- tacked Sirhindi, compiling several treatises in refuting his beliefs, of which the most known is Qadh al-ZindfiJahalat Ahl Sirhind.47 The 44 Al-Muhibbi, Khuldsat al-Athar, vol. 4, 358; al-Shatti, Mukhtasar, 108-11; al-Zirikli, al-A'lam, vol. 7, 203. 45 Al-Hamawi, "Fawa'id al-Irtihal", vol. 1, p. 459. 46 Al-Muradi, Silk al-Durar, vol. 4, 65; al-Zirikli, al-A'lam, vol. 6, 203-4. 47 For a fairly comprehensive list of al-Barazanji's works, see al-Baghdadi, Hadiyat al-'Arifin, vol. 2, columns 302-3. 324</page><page sequence="19">TASAWWUF AND REFORM IN PRE-MODERN ISLAMIC CULTURE 325 argument for Sirhindi's position was forcefully made by the Egyptian 'alim, sojourning in Makka at the time, shaykh Ahmad al-Bashbishi (1041/1632-1096/1685), and the Naqshbandi 'alim, Muhammad Bek b. Yar al-Bukhari (b. 1041/1632), a new comer to the Hara- mayn.48 Al-Hamawi speaks of al-Kurani's position in this episode in highly ambiguous terms; other clues, however, indicate that al-Kuirani was far from being an ambivalent observer of the debate. Although the Kurdish Islamic environment was, during most of the Ottoman period, dominated by the Qadiriyya tariqa, and it was not until the appearance of Mawlana Khalid al-Shahrazuri (1776-1826) 49 that Naqshbandiyya would establish a foothold in the Kurdish region, al-Kurani joined the Naqshbandiyya tariqa-among others-through al-Qushashi. Yet, the Naqshbandiyya chain he was affiliated with was not a Mujaddidiyya chain, and thus was unrelated to Sirhindi.50 The fact that al-Kufrani, at a later stage of his career, was initiating his students into the Naqshbandiyya tariqa through the Sirhindi's chain of authority, the Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya,51 is an indication of change of outlook, at least at the level of al-Kufrani's view of this specific tariqa. The crux of Sirhindi's teachings was his attack on the syncretism of the Mogul emperor Akbar, and his challenge to the 'ulama's complacency towards Akbar's attempts to create a universal religion. By undertaking such a position against the powerful emperor, Sir- hindi's endeavor unfolded in a logical sequence, from his denun- ciation of bid'a (illicit innovation) to his intolerance of the customs of dance (raks) and sama' (session of singing and music-playing) associated with popular tasawwuf.

NAFI tasawwuf, Sirhindi also sought to replace the doctrine of wahdat al- wujud, which he saw as pantheistic, with the doctrine of wahdat al- shuhud (the unity of witness) in determining the sufi experience. For Sirhindi, wahdat al-shuhud offered an explanation of the suifi experience of elevation that conforms to shari'a.52 Sirhindi, however, was not the first in the seventeenth century to object to the identi- fication of tasawwuf with wahdat al-wujud. During the same period, Mulla 'All b. Muhammad ibn Sultan al-Qari al-Harawi (d. 1014/ 1606),53 the eminent and controversial Makkan scholar of hadith, wrote a caustic polemic against the excesses of suffi tariqa and Ibn 'Arabi.54 Yet, Sirhindi was the first to advance a comprehensive (that is both legalist and socio-intellectual) reformist challenge to tradi- tional sufi tariqas, laying out an alternative system of thought that aimed at reconciling tasawwuf with shari'a. The context of his en- deavor, being a response to the highest political authority, and his employing of the powerful vehicle of the Naqshbandiyya tariqa to propagate his ideas, added more weight and authority to Sirhindi's reformist message, attributes that al-Harawi lacked. Al-Kufrani's embrace of Naqshbandiyya would, therefore, have certain implications for his view of shari'a and tasawwuf, as well as for his understanding of his own mission as a teacher and scholar. 52 On Sirhindi and his teachings, see Ahmad Sirhindi, Maktubat al-Imdm al-Rabbdan Mujadid al-Alf al-Thant (Istanbul: Enver Baytan Kitabivi, n.d.), vol. 1, 41-4, 56-8, 67- 9, 192-5, 254-6, 260-80, 342-6, vol. 2, 3-8, 25-6, 45-57, 89-92; Aziz Ahmad, An Intel- lectual History of Islam in India (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1969), 4; Ishtiaq Husain Qureshi, The Muslim Community of the Indo-Pakistani Subcontinent, 610- 1947 (The Hague: Mouton &amp; Co., 1960), 151-2; Abul Hasan Nadwi, Saviours of Islamic Spirit: Shaikh Ahmad Mujadid Alf Thant (Lucknow: Academy of Islamic Research and Publications, 1983); Yohanan Friedmann, Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi: An Outline of His Thought and a Study of His Image in the Eyes of Posterity (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1971); Muhammad 'Abdul Haq Ansari, Sufism and Shari'a: A Study of Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi's Effort to Reform Sufism (Leicester: The Islamic Founda- tion, 1986). 53 On his life and work, see Muhammad 'Abd al-Hayy al-Luknawi, al-Fawa'id al- Bahiyyafi Tarajim al-Hanafiyya (Beirut: Dar al-Kitab al-Islami, n.d.), 8-9; al-Muhibbi, Khulasat al-Athar, vol. 3, 185-6; al-Shawkani, al-Badr al-Trli', vol. 1, 445; Sarkis, Mujam al-Matbu'at, vol. 2, column, 1791-2; al-Zirikli, al-A'lam, vol. 5, 12-3. 54 See, for example, Mulla 'Ali ibn Sultan al-Qari, "Risala fi al-Radd 'ala Ibn 'Arabi", ms. 199, Tasawwuf, Institute of Arabic Manuscript, the Arab League, Cairo.

Besides wit- nessing the controversial debate over Sirhindi's ideas, he was cer- tainly conscious of the ferocious confrontation between al-Harawi and his contemporaries, and sought, perhaps, to avoid falling into a similar situation. Yet, there was still another controversial episode, related to a Yemeni revivalist 'alim, which seems to have contrib- uted to the shaping of al-Kurani's vocation. Salih b. Mahdi al-Maqbali (1047/1637-1118/1696) was born in the Yemeni village of Maqbal where he was raised and educated as a Zaydi 'alim. But as he grew older, al-Maqbali developed an inde- pendent and critical outlook to the established Zaydi culture and to the dominant modes of Islamic culture in general.55 Following on the footsteps of another Zaydi revivalist, Muhammad b. Ibrahim al- Wazir (known also as Ibn al-Wazir; 775/1373-840/1436),56 who was influenced by Ibn Hazm, the Andalusian Zahiri scholar, and by Ibn Taymiyya, al-Maqbali rejected the rigid confines of the Zaydi madh- hab and embraced a broader view of Islam, a non-madhhabi Islam. What infuriated conservative Zaydi circles of San'a' even further was al-Maqbali's uncompromising attack on the tradition of taqlad and his call for unrestricted and unhindered ijtihad. Al-Maqbali, obviously influenced by the salafi school, called for the return to the Qur'an and the Sunna as the direct sources of shari'a at all times, was un- reserved in his refutation of Ash'ari and Mu'tazali theology and spared no effort in his opposition to tasawwuf and sufi tariqas. This powerful message of puritan and reformist Islam incurred the wrath of not only Zaydi circles but also traditional Sunni 'ulama' in Makka to which he escaped the highly emotional charges against him in San'a'.

NAFI from Muhammad al-Barazanji, provoking a counter-response from al-Maqbali.57 But while al-Barzanji, faithful to the dominant tradi- tions, opposed al-Maqbali, al-Kurani took him under his wings, as a teacher and student at the same time. An intellectual bifurcation was, thus, developing among disciples of al-Qushashi. Al-Maqbali's ideas, nonetheless, could have only reinforced al- Kurani's convictions, for these ideas were too confrontational and too rapturous to be embraced in full by al-Kurani. In the last de- cades of the seventeenth century, traditional Islamic culture was so powerful that it could only be challenged from within and gradu- ally. Al-Maqbali, of course, was not the only route to the reformist legacy of Ibn Taymiyya, for al-Kurani had already been initiated into that route. His prompt, and perhaps risky, support of al-Maqbali, indicates that al-Kfrani's view of Ibn Taymiyya had been formulated before meeting the controversial Yemeni 'alim. The question, how- ever, is what system of idea could have been constructed by a late- seventeenth-century 'alim with profound sufi and Ash'ari training and an admiration for Ibn Taymiyya? On Sufism and Theology Ibrahim ibn Hasan al-Kfrani was an 'alim who lived between two worlds, a world enveloped in unionist sufism and the late Ash'ari theology, which reached the zenith of its cultural dominance in the seventeenth century and could no longer go any further, and an- other world, undefined yet, which was struggling to emerge from underneath the ceiling of the established intellectual modes. In a role not unlike that of Sirhindi, al-Kurani came to contribute to defining the features of the new world. 'ulama' and suifis, such as Sirhindi, al-Harawi and al-Maqbali, with different concerns and cul- tural stratagems, posed serious challenges to the ideology of wahdat al-wujud and to Ash'ari theology. Conscious of his position as an influential teacher, the profound sufi traditions he inherited and the significance of the Madinan centre that he was associated with, 57 al-Shawkani, al-Badr al-Tali' vol. 1, 288-92. 328</page><page sequence="23">TASAWWUF AND REFORM IN PRE-MODERN ISLAMIC CULTURE 329 al-Kiurani, on the other hand, had to chart his way in the middle of currents that began to collide intensely and vociferously. For al- Kutrani, a reformist project that aimed at a total rupture with suifism and Ash'arism was undoubtedly futile and dead ended. Moreover, his intellectual, social and educational ties with the traditional circles were too powerful to be severed without painful human costs that he seemed unprepared to bear. Instead, he appears to have opted for a third way, the way of reconstructing suffism and Ash'arism to render them more consistent with what he saw as the original Islamic view. His means were the invocation and restoration of the Hanbali/ Taymiyyan legacy and the re-introduction of it as the standard Is- lamic theological vision. What is important to underline, however, is that al-Kuirani's choice was not solely the result of personal contem- plations, but rather of an objective situation in which the recourse to the Hanbali/Taymiyyan vision became a way out of a stagnant cultural milieu that seemed to threaten the bonds between the com- munity and the high values of religion. The writings of Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani were perhaps the last to project a favorable view of Ibn Taymiyya outside of the strict and evidently small Hanbali circles.58 By the mid-fourteenth century, it did seem that the salafi view of Islam, as was expressed by Ibn Tay- miyya, was largely eclipsed by the suifi/Ash'ari 'ulama' establishment. Even in Hanbali circles, the writings of Ibn Taymiyya were exercis- ing no significant influence, while Hanbali 'ulama' subscribed in large numbers to sufi tariqas, whether popular or less popular, which became a necessary route for gaining position and privilege in the 'ulama' institution.59 Hence, the early-sixteenth century's treatise on the virtues of Ibn Taymiyya, written by Mar'i al-Karmi in Cairo,60 was 58 See, for example, Ahmad ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani, al-Durar al-Kamina fi A'iyan al-Ma'a al-Thamina, ed.

Against this background, the choice made by al-Kurani should be seen as a critical choice, both in terms of its nature and implication, reflected, thus, in a discursive inner tension pervading his text. Despite receiving a substantial training in hadith, both as a text and chains of authority, and his presence in a highly active milieu of hadith learning, al-Kfirani was not a scholar of hadith in the lit- eral sense; rather he employed his vast knowledge of hadith as a means for re-reading the major issues of suifism and theology, influ- enced perhaps by al-Qushashi who too was highly interested in theo- retical sufism and theology. In one of the first works he finalized in 1071/1660-61, immediately after the passing of his teacher, al-Kurani discussed one of the most problematic issues of Islamic theology, the Qur'an and the divine speech.61 Although it is not particularly clear why he found it necessary to treat this issue, it seems that the ever-persisting question of the nature of the Qur'an was raised again during the controversy that accompanied the arrival of Salih al- Maqbali in the Haramayn. Both al-Hamawi and al-'Aiyashi relay that al-Kurani's writings in theology followed an extensive research, in- cluding correspondences with his former teacher in Damascus, 'Abd al-Baqi al-Hanbali. Al-Kurani requested that al-Hanbali provide him of "his firm and thorough opinion" of the Hanbali/Taymiyyan posi- tion on the principal issues of kaldm, and to supply him with the relevant works of Ibn Taymiyya.62 Other tracts that al-Kurani com- pleted afterwards indicate that he developed close knowledge of and familiarity with the opinions of Ibn Taymiyya and his devout disciple Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (691/1292-751/1350). Abf al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (260/875-324/939), from whose ideas the AshCari school evolved, concluded his career with a declared adop- tion of the Hanbali theological position;63 the development of the Ash'ari theology and its ultimate domination of the Sunni thought were, therefore, the function of the late Ash'ari school and the 61 Ibrahim b.

For the Ash'aris, the Qur'an is the divine speech not in the literal sense but in the sense of the mental speech (al-kaldm al-nafs) ,65 the inner kalam, unuttered in words, exactly like the Qur'anic narrative of the Prophet Yusuf speaking to himself {But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secret to them. He said (to himself): 'Ye are the worse situated"; and God knoweth best the truth of what ye assert.}.66 In this instance, Yfisuf made a defined and clear statement, yet without utterances. The principal motivation behind the Ash'ari proposition of the "mental speech" concept is the attempt to solve the dilemma arising from the related question of the nature of man's reading of the Qur'an. Necessities of transcendentalization, tanzfh, require accepting that man, including his voice, is the creation of God, which invites the question of whether regarding the Qur'an, when recited in human voice, as the divine speech, amounts to attri- buting to man what is essentially an attribute of God. The Ash'aris, by and large, saw in the "mental speech" concept a solution of what they perceived as a vexing problem, where the Qur'an is defined as "the mental speech" of God before it descended on His Prophet and was thus revealed in words, utterances, and written in books, which are all creations of God. Al-Kfirani adopted the "mental speech" concept and defended it 64 On the late Ash'ari school, see El 2, s. v. "Ash'ariyya", by M. Montgomery Watt. 65 On the concept of the "mental speech", see Bernard Weiss, "Exotericism and Objectivity in Islamic Jurisprudence.," in Nicholas Heler, Islamic Law and Jurispru- dence (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1990), 53-71, especially, 53-55.

He first tried to assert that not only the Ash'aris but also Ibn Hanbal accepted the idea of "mental speech",67 imply- ing that the latter's acceptance of it is in itself an indication of its validity. But conscious of the well known Hanbali (especially of the neo-Hanbali-Taymiyyan line) rejection of the "mental speech" con- cept, al-Kutrani invokes a statement made by Ibn 'Aqil (431/1040- 513/1119),68 one of the most controversial Hanbalis, in which he said that "the Qur'an is the divine speech before it is recited to us, when it is still in the hearts, not uttered in voice and letters", as an implied recognition of the "mental speech".69 Al-Kurani also at- tempts, with little success, to find in Shifa' al-'Alld, Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya's major work of theology,70 what might refute his own re- jection of the "mental speech" idea.71 Al-Kuirani then proceeded by augmenting his argument for the "mental speech" with evidence from the Qur'an and hadith, and with a detailed linguistic analysis of the term kaldm.72 From his perspective, however, if al-kalam al- nafsl (the mental speech) was an attribute of God, it is in Him not like it is in man, for God is unique in His essence and attributes, and His words are, thus, "mystical, free of all elements, whether materialistic, imagined or spiritual, and are eternal."73 The problem of al-Kfurani's attempt to reconcile the Ash'ari and the Hanbali views on the nature of the Qur'an lies mainly in the fact that he, firstly, failed to furnish any evidence to the effect that Ibn Hanbal approved of the "mental speech" concept, and that, secondly, he made no distinction between the late Ash'ari school and al-Ash'ari himself. Al-Kutrani's source for al-Ash'ari's opinions is Ibn 'Asakir's book, Tabyyfn Kadhib al-Muftari,74 in which Ibn 'Asakir 67 Al-Kurani, "Ifadat al-'Allam", plate 6. 68 On Ibn 'Aqil and his position in the development of the Hanbali school, see George Makdisi, Ibn 'Aqil et la resurgence de 17slam traditionaliste au XIe siecle (Damas- cuss: PIFD, 1963); EI 2, s. v.

Al-Ibdna, the last of al-Ash'ari's works, was highly praised by Ibn Taymiyya, a fact of which al-Kfurani was fully aware.75 Yet, like Ibn Hanbal, and contrary to Ibn 'Asakir's report, al-Ibdna makes no reference to the "mental speech" idea or to al-Ash'ari's belief in its validity. Al-Kfurani, there- fore, was trying to reconcile a late Ash'ari concept by employing the authority of al-Ibana, in which al-Ash'ari is generally believed to have been more in accord with the Hanbali-salafi school than with his late followers. What is important here is that al-Kfurani's highlight- ing of al-Ibana (to which he would refer directly in later works) and considering it the principal source of the Ash'ari theology, would subsequently lead him to a closer identification with the salafi-Han- bali position. Where he addressed the whole issue of the attributes of God, al- Kufrani parted company with the late Ash'ari dogma altogether, taking the side of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim. Ash'ari scholars, by and large, divided God's attributes into four categories. The first is the attributes of Being, such as the existence and knowledge, which they affirmed and described as part of God's essence; the second is the attributes of action, such as the creating and providing, which they equally affirmed but defined as extraneous to the essence; the third is the attributes of meaning, such as the hearing and seeing, which they also affirmed but refrained from discussing their rela- tion to the essence of God. All late Ash'aris, although in various manners, including al-Ghazali, al-Iji, al-Amidi and al-Razi, however, denied the fourth category, comprising the corporeal attributes (al- sifat al-khabariyya, or the attributes relayed to us in the scripture), such as the hand and the ear of God, and interpreted them alle- gorically.76 While the Mu'tazilis accepted only the attributes of Being 75 See, for example, Ahmad ibn Taymiyya, Dar' Ta'drud al-'Aql wal-Naql: Muwafaqat Sahzh al-Manqul li-Sah.h al-Ma'qul, ed.

NAFI and allegorically interpreted all others, the salafis, including ahl al- hadlth (the traditionists), Ibn Hanbal and the majority of the Han- balis, most prominently the neo-Hanbalis, Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim, affirmed all attributes, rejected ta'wil (allegorical inter- pretation) at any level, and refrained from defining the relation between the attributes of God and His essence by resorting to the "without how" principle.77 Repeatedly, al-Kufrani declared his adherence to the salafi posi- tion, and at the end of his treatise, he staged a powerful defense of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya and their theological views, especially against the accusations, widely circulating in the Ash'arn circles, of their corporealistic (tajsim) tendencies. After a detailed treatment of the salafi scholar's ideas, as were laid out in his influ- ential al-Risala al-Tadmuriyya,78 al-Kurani concluded that Ibn Tay- miyya "affirmed to God what God affirmed to Himself, and denied what God denied Himself, affirmation without anthropomorphism (tashbih) and transcendentalization without divestation (ta'tfl)."79 This vindication of Ibn Taymiyya is extended to Ibn al-Qayyim, "for the latter followed always his teacher in what they believed to be the salafi doctrine". Notwithstanding the real outcome of al-Kurani's attempt to reconcile the Ash'ari and the Hanbali views on the nature of the Qur'an, his understanding of the attributes of God was an indication of the extent to which he would go to rehabilitate the Taymiyyan legacy within the sufi-Ash'ari circles. Al-Kfirani's second field of inquiry related to the sufi experience and the principal of wahdat al-wujud, which he dealt with in two treatises, Ithaf al-Dhak ,80 and Tanbth al-'Uqul,8' written respectively in 1072 and 1073/1661-63.

It is clear, however, that Ithaf al-Dhaki was more than a commentary, since al-Kurani's independent introduc- tions to the actual commentary covered about two thirds of his trea- tise. It is, therefore, in the long introductory part that we should search for a frame of reference for al-Kirani's conceptualization of sufism and the sufi experience. Al-Kurani began by explaining that his decision to write a com- mentary on al-Burhanburi's treatise was a response to Javanese stu- dents' apprehension over the spread of deviated sui books in their country, compiled by poorly learned and unscrupulous writers, and harming the peoples' beliefs and pulling them away from the correct understanding of Islam. Al-Kurani's goal, therefore, was to convey the sufi knowledge in "a comprehendible manner and in agreement with the Qur'an and the Sunna."83 He then proceeds by laying out his definition of the science of truths ('ilm al-haqa'iq; or tasawwuf), which he believed to be the science "searching in the modes of existence from the perspective of its essence and its ap- pearance in forms". Tasawwuf is, thus, not a mere way of, or guide- lines for, leading an ascetic life, but is rather a philosophical pursuit, a position that implies al-Kurani's adherence to wahdat al-wujud. Yet conscious of the discursive consequences of his statement, al-Kurani followed by asserting that if it was understood that the "science of truths" is the science dealing with the inner (baitin) truth, this level of truth cannot be "realized without grasping the rules of the outer (zdhir, shari'a) in accordance with the righteous predecessors (al- salaf al-salih, the favorite Hanbali term)."84 This approach, reflect- ing an affirmation of an intertwined association and interdependency of shar'i obligations and sui vision, becomes the revolving point of the whole introductory part of al-Kurani's work, expressed repeat- edly in various forms and fashions. 82 For a full Arabic text of al-Tuhfa, with English translation, see Johns, The Gift Addressed to the Spirit of the Prophet. 83 Al-Kurani, "Ithaf al-Dhaki", plates 3-4. 84 Ibid., plates 11-14.</page><page sequence="30">BASHEER M. NAFI The first introduction carries the first principle of al-Kfirani's system of thought: "The Qur'an is the criterion of all criteria, judges all books and judged by no book ... and the Sunna of the Prophet is its elaboration."85 What is meant by this assertion is not only an announcement of commitment to the Islamic consensus, but main- ly setting the background against which the entire field of sufism should be assessed. It, thus, follows that any claim made by the esotericists (ahl al-kashf), which transgresses the boundaries of the Qur'an and the Sunna, should not be considered a correct knowl- edge and should be rejected. Recalling al-Junayd, to whom as well as to Ibn 'Arabi he would frequently refer, al-Kurani wrote, "our science is bound by the Qur'an and the Sunna." Further elabora- tions on his understanding of the sufi approach to the Qur'an are outlined in the second introduction, where he recognizes, as any sufi 'alim, that the Qur'an has an inner and an outer aspect, and an isthmus connecting the two. He does not, however, seek, like most sutfis, to establish dual, separate fields of knowledge, but commits himself to a holistic approach in which the divine text is to be under- stood simultaneously as inner and outer.86 What is equally impor- tant is al-Kurani's assertion that knowledge of the inner does not in any way entail freedom from the outer, for the suifi experience is not a license to release oneself from the shari'a and its obligations. The third introduction deals with the same concern from a theo- logical angle. For al-Kfrani, in order to approach the reality of things, as they exist in the divine knowledge, one should hold to the belief of al-salaf al-salih who were totally free of the ills of corporeity, anthro- pomorphism and the deviation of allegorical interpretation (ta'wil).87 Doubtless, al-Kurani was very much aware of the difficulties surround- ing any attempt to rationally reconcile the belief in the oneness of God and the necessities of exaltation on the one hand, and, on the other, the many ambiguous verses of the Qur'an, inferences of which could be incomprehensible to human mind. It is, of course, in this entangled area of meanings that the field of the sufi inquiry lay, and where the main motivations for the different sufi theories, from 85 Ibid., plates 14-16. 86 Ibid., plate 19. 87 Ibid., plate 32. 336</page><page sequence="31">TASAWWUF AND REFORM IN PRE-MODERN ISLAMIC CULTURE 337 wahdat al-wujfd to wahdat al-shuhfd, arose. By rejecting corporeity, anthropomorphism and allegorical interpretation, al-KCurani is in effect constructing a salafi foundation for suffism, exactly as the Hanbali ascetics of the classical Islamic period tried to accomplish. His objective becomes even clearer in the following two introduc- tions, where he re-emphasizes the notion that every thing that the devout people of the way (the sufis) achieve is the result of their adherence to the shari'a. Only those who fully follow the shari'a, inwardly and outwardly, can be trusted, since the belief in the unity of existence should not be taken as being against the exaltation and transcendentalization of God. In other words, " the justifying of (reaching the stage of) certainty by revealing (kashf) and then making a claim (justified by kashj) as to the lifting of the shar'i obligations is a plain apostasy (ilhdd)."88 Although al-Kurrani presents, in Ithdf al-Dhaki, a powerful intel- lectual and theological apology for the principle of wahdat al-wujiud and its accordance with the Islamic orthodox view, it is in Tanbzh al-'Uq1u89 that he discusses the issue in full. This short, but highly effective, work begins with a conventional defense of sulfism, based on the idea that the misunderstanding of the sutfi discourse and accusing sutfis of unitarianism (ittihadiyya), corporeity and anthro- pomorphism, arise from unfamiliarity with their terms and from the failure to assess their discourse according to their founding assump- tions. Al-Kiurani's attempt to secure a niche for the principle of wahdat al-wujfd in the heart of Islamic culture, an attempt for the sake of which his profound knowledge of theology, hadith and stfi traditions are all called upon, rests on the following points: 1. God is the only Being that is unchangeable and unalterable; every other existence is imagined. 2. The belief in corporeity is mistaken, for the adherence to "He is unlike any other thing" negates any illusion of corporeity, and that the "righ- teous predecessors" stated that all ambiguous verses of the Qur'an should be taken as they are, with the affirmation of God's attributes and without searching for the "how". 3. God is defined by His essence not by any extra-definer to Himself, while all contingent entities are defined by a definer extraneous to 88 Ibid., plate 57. See also plates 42, 45 and 56. 89 Al-Kurani, "Tanbih al-'Uqfil", 14 pp.</page><page sequence="32">BASHEER M. NAFI their beings. His (i.e. God) appearance in appearances does not ne- gate transcendentalization, for the realities have different self-abilities (corresponding to their functions or the purposes of their existence) that are like mirrors for the appearance of God. While the looker into the different mirrors sees himself in them, the mirror images are not in fact the real beings of the reflected entities, which are externally sustainable. So is the revealing of God in the mirrors of the realities; although God did not move into them or was transfigured in them, since He is defined by Himself for Himself and the images are de- fined according to their different abilities. 4. Again, the revealing of God in the created should not be taken as corporeity or anthropomorphism, for it is, as Ibn 'Arabi indicated, like the revealing of the sunlight on the moon, where it is rationally un- derstood that the moon has not in itself anything of the sunlight, nor did the sun transpose into the moon. Similarly, the created is a reflec- tion of God, an appearance of Him. 5. Thus, for al-Kurani, wahdat al-wujud means that the world is not the essence of God ('ayn al-Haqq), but what appeared in the essential existence (al-wujud al-haqq); God is the absolute existence, as is ex- plained by the beginning and the end of the Qur'anic verse, {To God belong the East and the West; whithersoever ye turn, there is the presence (the face) of God. For God is All-pervading, All-Knowing}.90 The vast, absolute Being is not limited by other than Himself, even when perceived as revealed in confined forms. This what makes al- Hallaj's declaration that he was the Haqq mistaken, because the es- sence of man is not the essence of God. Al-Kurani's thesis offers neither a critical nor an analytical read- ing of Ibn 'Arabi and the principle of wahdat al-wujud, but rather a selective reading, an interpretive reading with a priori agenda. It is a reading that does not search for the inner contradictions of Ibn 'Arabi's system of thought, as a typical salafi 'alim might be expected to do, nor does it seek to highlight the superiority of the esoteric- mystical understanding of the scripture; it is rather a conciliatory, syncretic reading. Informed by the great questions underlining the Islamic conceptual approach to the oneness of God and the multi- plicity of the world, al-Kfrani's text is an attempt to legitimate wahdat al-wujfud, not only in the eyes of the strict Muslim but even in the eyes of the stricter, the salafi. One may infer from the first point of al-Kiurani's argument an affinity to the Hallajian wahdat al-shuhfd (testimonial unity), despite his criticism of al-Hallaj, a result perhaps 90 The Qur'an, Sura II, 115 ('Ali's translation). 338</page><page sequence="33">TASAWWUF AND REFORM IN PRE-MODERN ISLAMIC CULTURE 339 of being influenced by the writings of Sirhindi; yet, ultimately, al- Kurani's real aim was to affirm the credentials of the sufi experience as sober and totally committed to the tenets of Islam. While the con- cept of wahdat al-wujud may seem to imply a permanent associational relationship between the divine and the contingent, al-Kurani sought to separate the two realms by affirming the limits of man and the transcendence of God. Whether in Ithaf al-Dhaki or in Tanbzh al-'Uqul, al Kurani's text evinces growing doubts over the validity of the expe- riential dimension of sufism and its impact on the spiritual making of the community. Although he never dismissed the individualistic experience altogether, he appears to admit to its sheer subjectivity,91 seeking thereby to hedge it in multiple orthodox restrictions. This tendency in al-Kurani's intellectual pursuit would reach an- other height in a tract he dedicated for the discussion of the con- cept of kasb (acquisition), which seems to have been written in the mid-1070s AH/1661, and to have been held in high regard by his students and disciples to the extent of being copied in full in the first volume of al-'Aiyashi's travelogue.92 In this work, al-Kurani's discord with the established Ash'ari dogma becomes clear, holding instead to views of the salafi school and of al-Juwayni, especially in the latter's al-'Aqida al-Nizamiyya.93 Al-Kurani's target is Sharh al-Ma- qasid of al-Taftazani (d. 792/1390), the late Ash'ari-Maturidi scholar, who contributed significantly to the final formulation of the Ash'ari- Maturidi dogma in the pre-modern Islamic period.94 Throughout 91 For a discussion of the validity of the experiential aspect of tasawwuf, see Oliver Leaman, "Philosophy vs. Mysticism: An Islamic Controversy", in M.

NAFI its history, the Ash'ari school was particularly concerned with re- sponding to the Mu'tazilis' emphasis on man's responsibility and his total freedom to determine his course of action, categorizing the Mu'tazili position as a flagrant contradiction to the Islamic belief in the omnipotence of God. The Ash'ari view on predestination and man's responsibility is posited in the notion of kasb (acquisition), which was also accepted, in a slightly different version, by the Maturi- dis.95 Although the notion of kasb can be found in a primitive and unclear form in Abfu 1-Hasan al-Ash'ari's works, it was mainly devel- oped by his followers. In its later and refined conceptualization, kasb entails the belief that the contingent (human) power has no actual effect over the accomplished actions resulting from the act, for the actions are, like the actor, the creation of God and cannot be in- trinsically attributed to human power.96 In order to justify man's reward and punishment in the Day of Judgment in proportion to man's kasb in the world, and keep faithful to safeguarding the be- lief in an omnipotent and transcendental God at the same time, Ash'ari scholars struggled to draw a line between man's responsibil- ity and his concomitantly accidental power. One of the main con- sequences of the Ash'ari fideism was the total denial of causation in nature. Late Ash'aris, including the Andalusian Maliki scholar, Ibn al-'Arabi, as well as the highly influential al-Sanfisi, held that "one who believed that fire intrinsically burns... is an infidel (kafir), and one who believes that it (the fire) burns by the power endowed in it by God (which is the salafi view) is an ignorant, grave sinner (fasiq)."97 Described by Gardet as a "negation of human freedom in differs slightly, from its more influential Ash'ari counterpart. Gradually, however, he moved closer to Ash'arism, especially in his later works, such as Sharh al-Maqasid, and is widely seen as a main figure in the rapprochement of the two schools. 95 On the differences between the Ash'ari and Maturidi theologies, see W. Mont- gomery Watt, The Formative Period of Islamic Thought (Oxford: Oneworld, 1998), 314- 6. 96 See, for example, 'Ali ibn Muhammad al-Jurjani (al-Sharif), Sharh al-Mawdqif li-'Adud al-Dzn al-Iji, ed.

To its Muslim opponents, however, the Ash'ari kasb was no more than a failed mental exercise, a disguised predeterminationism (jabriyya). After the demise of Mu'tazilism, it was left to the Hanbalis of the salafi school to lead the opposition to the late Ash'ari dogma, especially its notion of kasb.99 For al-Kfrani, the understanding that human power is concomi- tant to, but has no effect on, the acts makes kasb a name without meaning; the correct belief is that human power is effective, not independently but by God's will.100 Invoking the virtue of the middle way, in a community that is deeply imbued with the notion of being the media\n umma, al-Kiurani expresses a profound conviction that his position does neither contradict the belief in the unity (tawhid) of actions, nor does it lead to anthropomorphism, corporeity, im- manentism or unitarianism. God is the necessary Being, His existence and perfection is indebted to no other agent, while the existence and perfection of the contingent is indebted to God; it is essential for the human perfection to acquire the power to choose and to act. From al-Kurani's perspective, whereby the late Ash'ari view is implicitly predeterminstic and falls short of the Islamic moderation, the Mu'tazili view amounts to total human independence of God and rises above the moderate level. In al-Kurani's words, "Man's acquisition through his effective power, willed by God ... entails a clear distinction from predetermination (jabr), the permission (of God), and that human will is contingent upon God's will, not the belief in (hu- man) independence, which is the saying of the people of Mu'tazilism who advanced that God may will what they would not do and they do what He may not will."101 Although al-Kfurani seeks to justify his conversion to the salafi view 98 El, 2, s. v. "Allah", by L. Gardet. 99 An example of which is Ibn al-Qayyim, Shifa' al-'Alzl. This book, in 307 pp., is entirely dedicated to the discussion of will and predestination from a salafi per- spective, and though not widely known, is more succinct and lucid than the Ibn Taymiyya's similar works, although the influence of the great master, Ibn Taymiyya, on Ibn al-Qayyim is profound. 100 Al-Kurani, "al-Ilma' al-Muhit", 431. 101 Ibid., 437.</page><page sequence="36">BASHEER M. NAFI of kasb by referring extensively to al-Nizamiyya of al-Juwayni (Imam al-Haramayn, 419/1028-478/1085), he is also keen to project the significance of al-Juwayni's work through the exceptional praise that Ibn al-Qayyim bestowed on it in his Shifa` al-'All, the most compre- hensive study of predestination by the salafi-Hanbali student of Ibn Taymiyya. In fact, one has the feeling that al-Kuirani may have never dealt directly with al-Nizamiyya, which was always less circulated than al-Juwayni's other works, and that al-Kfirani's introduction to al- Nizamiyya was accomplished through Ibn al-Qayyim's approvingly long and literal quote from it in Shifa' al-'Alil,102 with which he was certainly familiar. At any rate, once more, if al-Kfirani's interest in the salafi concept of kasb, in which he seemed to see the way out of the extremist formulations of the Ash'aris and the Mu'tazilis, was not to be rejected by his contemporaries, it had to be, or to appear to be, reconciled with the Ash'ari system of thought. But never in any of his available works did al-Kfrani come closer to the salafi position than in his tract on kasb, closer perhaps than any other sifi- Ash'ari 'alim since the outbreak of the controversy over Ibn Taymiyya in the fourteenth century. Al-Kfirani's subtle and intricate transfor- mation, his apologetic approach to the cardinal issues of theologi- cal and sufi thought and his tendency to present his views without entirely parting with the traditional intellectual norms, were bound to precipitate various effects on his students. Some amongst them would certainly continue to espouse Ibn 'Arabi's wahdat al-wujud and defend the Ash'ari theology, while others would take the reformist message into its logical conclusions. What is significant, however, was al-Kuirani's emergence as a point of reference for a large num- ber of 'ulama' throughout the eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries, replacing in effect the authority of Ahmad al-Qushashi. This shift of referential authority signified a shift in the intellectual thrust of those who were linked, directly or indirectly, with the Ma- dinan group of 'ulama'. 102 Ibn al-Qayyim, Shifa' al-'AlIl, 122-5. 342</page><page sequence="37">TASAWWUF AND REFORM IN PRE-MODERN ISLAMIC CULTURE 343 Successors and Followers Al-Kuirani, though the most prominent, was not the only one to regard himself as student of al-Qushashi, or to be exposed to the cultural milieu of suifi reformism and the revival of hadith scholar- ship. Among the others were Hasan ibn 'All al-'Ujaymi (1049/1639- 1113/1702),103 the historian and hadith scholar who was also a relater of al-Harawi's books; 'Abdullah b. Salim al-Basri (1048/1638-1134/ 1722),1?4 editor of the six major Sunni collections of hadith, and Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Nakhli (1044/1643-1130/1717),105 one of the most renowned Makkan affiliates of the Naqshbandiyya tariqa; all of whom were students of al-Qushashi and al-Babili. In the com- plex Islamic relations of learning and transmission of knowledge, al-Nakhli was also al-Kfurani's student, reading with him al-Ghazali's Ihya 'Ulfm al-Din. Together they dominated hadith scholarship and its chains of authority in the early eighteenth century and influenced the education of a large number of 'ulama'. Muhammad (Abtu 1-Tahir; 1081/1670-1145/1733), Ibrahim al- Kurani's son, took his father's position as a teacher in the Prophet mosque of Madina. His rise to assume the muftiship of the Shafi'is at Madina was a clear indication of his own prominence and of the influence of the school of thought he belonged to.106 Muhammad al-Kurani studied with his father and with many others of his father's 103 Ahmad b.

The young al-Kufrani's residence at Madina maintained the legacy of the circle and contributed to the dissemination of his father's teachings well into the early eighteenth century. One of his most celebrated students was Shah Wali-Allah Dihlawi,107 whose period of study in Madina between 1731-2 left a profound impact on him and consti- tuted, according to his son Shah 'Abd al-'Aziz, a turning point in his career.108 Another Madinan scholar and student of Ibrahim al-Kurani was Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Hadi al-Sindi (known also as Abu 1-Hasan al-Sindi the elder; d. 1138 or 1139/1726-1727) .09 Born at Batata of the Indian Sind region, Muhammad al-Sindi moved to Madina where he studied with al-Kuirani and al-Barazanji, emerging as a notable scholar of hadith. Among al-Sindi's long list of writings are six com- mentaries on the major Sunni six collections of hadith and another on Musnad Ibn Hanbal (Ahmad b. Hanbal's collection of hadith), as well as other commentaries and glosses on al-Nawawi's and al- Harawi's works. A major undertaking by any standard, al-Sindi's achievement represented a major revival of hadith commentary and the re-assertion of the position of hadith as a locus of religious authority. A Hanafi and Naqshbandi 'alim, Muhammad al-Sindi took hadith scholarship into a new level, thereby opening the doors for a clearer and more affirmative approach by the eighteenth-century revivalists. Muhammad al-Sindi was later followed to Madina by another of his countrymen, Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi (d. 1163/1750), who was 107 'Aziz Ahmad, "Political and Religious Ideas of Shah Wali-ullah of Delhi", Muslim World, LII, 1, 1962, 22.

Replacing his teacher Muhammad al-Sindi as the most sought scholar of hadith in the Prophet mosque of Madina, Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi made a significant contribution to the rising interest in hadith scholarship with, among other works, a major commentary on al-Mundhiri's collection, al-Targhib wal-Tarhib, another on al-Bu- khari's Sahih, as well as a commentary on al-Harawi's and al-Nawawi's collections of forty hadiths.112 During the two and half decades of teaching in Madina, al-Sindi's circle was joined by countless num- ber of students, the most important of whom was Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab.113 Al-Madhiyala-Li, who left a detailed biography of al-Sindi, lists a treatise of his in which he refuted Far'un's belief (the Pharaoh of Moses), entitled Risalafl 'Adam 'Iman Far'un."4 For the affirmation that Far'un died as a believer was a distinctive point of Ibn 'Arabi's theosophism, which turned into one of the key is- sues separating pantheistic tasawwuf from the strict adherence to Islamic beliefs, al-Sindi's advocacy of the strict Islamic view provides an important clue to his affinities. His selection of al-Mundhiri's collection of hadith, with its strict and powerful moralist tone, to annotate, and his upholding of the supremacy of the Qur'an and the Sunna as the principal sources of religion, provide additional clues. 110 Al-Kittani, Fihris al-Faharis, vol. 1, 356-7; al-Muradi, Silk al-Durar, vol. 4, 34; al- Zirikli, al-A'lam, vol. 6, 111. 111 Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi was initiated into the Naqshbandiyya tariqa by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Saqqaf (d. 1124/1712), who was instrumental in spreading the tariqa in the Hijaz during the early eighteenth century.

NAFI Careers of other members of this generation shed strong light on the connections between the Madinan circle and the cultural revival of Egypt during the early period of the eighteenth century: Ahmad b. Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Ghani (known also as Ibn al-Banna; d. 1117/1705), and Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Budayri (known also as Ibn al-Mayyit; d. 1140/1728). Both belonged to a sharifian family whose ancestor came to the Egyptian coastal town of Dumiyat fromJerusalem, and both received their early education in the flour- ishing Islamic learning circles of Dumiyat before moving to al-Azhar. Ibn 'Abd al-Ghani, who studied hadith with al-Babili and al-Kurani before being initiated into the Naqshbandiyya tariqa in Yemen by Ahmad ibn 'Ujayl, is described by al-Jabarti as "the seal of those who carried the burden of (spreading) the Naqshbandiyya tariqa in Egypt",115 a remark that implies the later decline of the Naqshban- diyya's fortunes in Egypt. After his period of internship in Madina and Yemen, Ibn 'Abd al-Ghani settled in Dumiyat for a while, teach- ing and spreading the Naqshbandiyya tariqa. Despite his apparent success, he was an 'alim with reclusive slfi tendencies who shunned the costly exposure accompanying scholarly eminence; he thus re- turned to the Hijaz where he died at the end of the pilgrimage season. Al-Budayri, on the other hand, joined al-Kfrani in 1091-92/ 1680-81, becoming closely identified with him and reading under his supervision a wide range of hadith, fiqh and sufi tracts. Follow- ing the norms of the time, al-Budayri was an affiliate of several sufi tariqas, although regarded himself principally as a Naqshbandi.L6 His thabt shows that he first joined the Naqshbandiyya by Ibn 'Abd al-Ghani through a non-Sirhindi silsila, but then reaffirmed his com- mitment to the tariqa at the hand of Murad al-Yazbaki al-Bukhari of Damascus in 1104/1684, who was a deputy for Muhammad al- 115 Al-Jabarti, 'Aja'ib al-Athdr, vol.1, 141.

A frequent traveller, al-Budayri's career was divided between Dumiyat, Cairo, Madina and his ancestors' town ofJerusalem, a mode of life that acquainted him with the most illustrious circles of 'ulama' across the Arab mashriq.118 In Cairo, he was closely associated with the Bakris and the al-Sadat al-Wafa'iyya, the two leading Shadhili houses that made immense contributions to the city's cultural life during the eighteenth century, and in Damascus with the circles of 'Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi and his disciples. Although not influential writers, both Ibn 'Abd al-Ghani and al- Budayri were viewed with high regard by their contemporaries as hadith scholars and suifi teachers. Mustaf-a ibn Kamal al-Bakri, who is reputed of reviving the Khalwatiyya tariqa in the Arab mashriq in the eighteenth century, studied hadith with al-Budayri in Jerusalem and was initiated into the Naqshbandiyya tariqa by him.119 In fact two other principal teachers of al-Bakri were students of al-Kfira- ni: Ilyas al-Kuirani, another of Ibrahim's sons (d. 1138/1724), who moved from Madina to Damascus, and the Hanbali hadith scho- lar of Damascus, Muhammad Abut 1-Mawahib al-Hanbali (d. 1126/ 1714),12? son of al-Kurani's former teacher and a later renowned mufti of Damascus.

Born in the Indian town of Bilgram, al-Zabidi traveled for learning to Delhi, Madina and the Yemeni city of Zabid, before settling in Cairo. His connections with the Madinan circle were extensive, listing among his mentors Wali-Allah Dihlawi, 'Umar b. Ahmad b. 'Aqil (1102/1691-1174/ 1760),126 the grandson of al-Basri and one of the most illustrious students of al-Kurani's associates in Makka and Madina; as well as 'Abdullah al-Sindi (d. 1194/1780),127 student of Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi. Like shaykh Hasan al-Jabarti, al-Zabidi also joined the Naqsh- bandiyya tariqa. In his still highly influential commentary on the Ihya,128 al-Zabidi embarked on an expansive intellectual undertak- ing to reconcile tasawwuf with the Islam tenets, displaying a rare familiarity with a wide range of Islamic sources with special regard to works of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim. This picture of extensive and continuous interaction between the 'ulama' of Egypt and the Haramayn suggests that the reformist im- pulses engendered by the Madinan circle and its associates had a direct impact on Islamic learning and the linguistic and literary awakening in Egypt prior to the arrival of the Napoleonic expedi- tion, although this cultural flourishing was a complex phenomenon that cannot be attributed to a single element.129 During the eigh- teenth century, relative economic affluence combined with the Mam- luk rulers' desire to consolidate their legitimacy, contributed to a significant surge in the construction of new madrasas and dedica- 125 Peter Gran, Islamic Roots of Capitalism: Egypt, 1760-1840 (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1979). 126 On his life and teachers, see al-Jabarti, 'Aja'ib al-Athdr, vol.1, 320-6; al-Kattani, Fihris al-Fahdris, vol. 2, 792-6.

NAFI tion of waqfs for meeting the requirements of the 'ulama' class. These favorable objective conditions, nonetheless, could not rekindle a cul- tural movement without the existence of an intellectual impulse, an intellectual predisposition for growth and diversification, as well as a critical spirit of the cultural status quo. If this was true for Egypt, it should invite further research into the cultural situation, during the same period, in other parts of the Muslim world. Yet, the number and range of al-Kiurani's students and disciples are almost impossible to comprehensively account for. In Yemen, al-Kurani's students included several members of the Mizjajis,130 one of the most celebrated families of 'ulama' in eighteenth-century Yemen, as well as Ishaq ibn Muhammad ibn Ju'man al-Zabidi (d. 1094/1683), who rose to become the Shafi'i judge of Zabid.131 Among other disciples of al-Kuirani were the renowned reformist scholar 'Abd al-Ra'uff of Singkel in Southeast Asia;132 the eminent scholar and traveler, Abu Salim al-'Aiyashi (d. 1090/1679) in Moroc- co;133 and the Turkish 'alim and judge, Salih b. Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Karim (d. 1087/1676),"34 who studied with al-Kufrani during his service as the Ottoman Hanafi judge of Madina in 1078/1667-8. Except for 'Abd al-Ra'uff, we know very little about the achievements of these 'ulama'. By Way of Conclusion The reformist impulses of the group of 'ulama' described here originated partly from developments that had been taking place within the Naqshbandiyya tariqa and its reformist approach to stafism, 130 On the Mizjajis, see John 0. Voll, "Linking Groups in the Networks of Eigh- teenth-Century Revivalist Scholars: The Mizjaji Family in Yemen", in Nehemia Levt- zion and John Voll (eds.), Eighteenth-Century Renewal and Reform in Islam (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1987), 69-92. 131 Al-Hamawi "Fawa'id al-Irtihal", vol. 2, 153. 132Johns, "Islam in Southeast Asia", 314-7; H.J.

Another possible source was a recurrent salafi trend of Yemeni-Zaydi origins, extending from Ibn al-Wazir to Salih al-Maqbali (and continued afterwards with al-Shawkani and Ibn al- Amir al-San'ani). All these elements fused with a growing Islamic reaction to the excesses of popular tasawwuf and its domination of the Islamic cultural and social life during the period between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries. Some of the main features characterizing this multi-generational network of 'ulama' are: a) The diversity of their madhhab affilia- tion, which indicates a growing tendency for breaking madhhab barriers within reformist circles, and the less emphasis that reform- ist 'ulama' placed on madhhab demarcations in favor of some other shared ideas and beliefs. b) Although most of the 'ulama' identified in this study regarded themselves principally as followers of a spe- cific sufi tariqa, largely the Naqshbandiyya, they commonly sub- scribed to more than one tariqa. This development implies that tasawwuf for this group of 'ulama', trained in the best traditions of the 'ulama' class, was becoming more of a cultural outlook than an exclusive vocation in the literal sense. c) Those with intellectual affinities among this group of 'ulama' tended to begin to question, in various degrees, one or more than one aspect of the Ash'ari theo- logy, of the pervasive doctrine of wahdat al-wujfd, and to reassert the position of Qur'an and the Sunna as the sources of religion and shari'a. These features, nonetheless, should not be understood as universally applicable to each single 'alim, student or disciple re- lated to this network, neither in scope nor in intensity. Relations connecting this group of Madinan 'ulama' with each other, as well as with their students, were essentially traditional Islamic educational relations, characterized by free and uncontrolled style of intellec- tual development. Although we tend to use terms like training, in- struction and teaching to describe this type of relations, these terms should not be understood in modern educational context. Islamic traditional style of learning, wrote Timothy Mitchell, "was remarkably flexible and free from coercion, when compared to the modern disciplinary schooling typified by the Lancaster system. Learning occurred as a relationship that, as in every craft, might be found between</page><page sequence="46">BASHEER M. NAFI any individuals at almost any point. Beginners learned from one another, according to their differing aptitudes, as much as from those who were masters; and even masters continued to learn from those who possessed other skills, who had mastered other texts. The method was one of argu- mentation and dispute, not lecturing. The individual was to be deferent where appropriate, but never passive."135 In such setting, students were not indoctrinated with tightly de- fined ideologies but were largely left to make their own choices and form their own convictions over the long and diversified journey of learning. Not all of those who came in touch with the Madinan circle, in one form or another, became a Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab, for the ideas circulating within this ferment were bound to be con- ditioned by multiple personal and objective imperatives. Rather than dismissing the whole proposition of "revivalist sutfism", this article suggests that the late seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies witnessed the emergence of a series of reformist individual culama', many of whom were loosely connected and the legacy of whom had a profound impact on the evolution of Islamic thought in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century. Their critical ap- proaches to the dominant cultural modes of tasawwuf and theology, and their attempts at reviving hadith scholarship, opened the doors for the re-emergence of the salafi school of thought in different parts of the Muslim world. The truth is that reformist impulses in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were sometimes subtle, while in other times pronounced and assertive; in a few cases they were manifested in institutionalized forms, while in most other cases they were individualistic. While some suai figures expressed reformist ideas, not all newly founded and successfully spread tariqas were necessarily reformist. For those culama' with a substantial intellec- tual output, written over a long period of time, it is only by evalu- ating a tangible volume of this output, and analyzing its historical 135 Timothy Mitchell, Colonizing Egypt (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 84.

The significance of al-Kurani, being a leading scholar and teacher, was in his attempt to develop a coherent discourse in which the creative re-appropriation of past theological themes would contrib- ute to reforming the dominant themes, without creating a condi- tion of disruptive conflict with the present. Several centuries earlier, even a great Ash'ari like al-Ghazali had to recognize the force and effectiveness of the salafi mode of thinking in safeguarding the re- ligious beliefs of the ordinary Muslim.136 Directness, clarity and sim- plicity, some of the inherent characteristics of the salafi approach to the cardinal issues of religion, equipped salafism with the power to engage the ordinary people and learned classes alike, and restore the position of the high values of the Islamic system of belief. Al- Kurani's concerns for religious coherence and well being of the community, as well as the community's sense of responsibility, threat- ened by dervishes, excessive sufi rituals and customs, radical Ash'ari fideism, and extreme interpretations of wahdat al-wujud, were trans- lated in the invocation of the salafi legacy. Equally significant was al-Kurani's attempt at rehabilitating Ibn Taymiyya and his school of thought. Once more, the salafi choice returned, as it was before and during the short period after Ibn Taymiyya, to become an Islamic choice, which could be espoused by a Shafi'i, a Maliki or a Hanafi 'alim, and not necessarily be confined to a small and ineffective corner of the Hanbali madhhab. This rehabilitation would have considerable impact on the careers of later associates of the Madinan circle, including Wali-Allah Dihlawi and Muhammad b. 'Abd al- Wahhab. Even two hundred years later, al-Kuirani's work would still be effective as a source of inspiration for the mid-nineteenth-cen- tury Iraqi scholar, Abu 1-Thana' al-Aluisi (1802-54),137 as he began to move away from his Hanafi-Ash'ari roots to a more salafi position. Yet, al-Kuirani's inclusive approach did not inevitably have to lead to 136 Al-Ghazali, al-Iqtisad ft al-I'tiqad, 97-8. 137 Abu 1-Thana' al-Alusi, "Ghara'ib al-Ightirab wa Nuzhat al-Albab fi l-Dhihab wal-Iqama wal-Iyab", ms, Tarikh 1149, Institute of Arab Manuscripts, The Arab League, Cairo, plates 130-9.

NAFI the fervent exclusiveness of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, and one should look for other political, social, and perhaps subjective, elements to understand the Wahhabi radical interpretation of Ibn Taymiyya and the salafi school in general. It has often been said that al-Ghazali had succeeded in making "sfifism respectable and acceptable to those in the Muslim commu- nity who were suspicious of its antinomian tendencies."138 The ques- tion that the great sUifis of the classical age had to grapple with was that if the inner truth is accessible through the mystical path, what is the need then for the exoteric, formal practices of religion? With the subsequent rise of suflism and its domination of the 'ulama' institution, as well as the life of ordinary people, tasawwuf had noth- ing to fear but itself. Al-Kfirani's age represented the beginning of the reversal of al-Ghazali's achievement, not by rendering tasawwuf unrespectable or unacceptable but by constraining its freehold and reasserting its commitment to the tenets of Islam. Although al-Kurani did not live in a tense political situation like Sirhindi's Mogul India, and was not as confrontational as al-Harawi and al-Maqbali, his writ- ings are still imbued with a sense of dedication and urgency that characterizes endeavors of conscientious reformists. His reformist concerns would continue to be pursued in the following century, sometimes in a gentle, sophisticated manner, and sometimes in a rapturous fashion. Finally, al-Kfirani's career provides strong evidence that the re- vival of hadith scholarship in the Madinan learning circles of the seventeenth century did not become a goal in itself, but rather a means for reforming fiqh and theology. The study of hadith as a founding text, manifested in the numerous commentaries on ma- jor hadith collections, initiated a movement of reconsideration of the accumulated traditions of fiqh and theology, and made this movement possible and legitimate. What al-Kirani, his associates and disciples, were trying to achieve was to go beyond the now compli- cated and trivialized 'ulama' discourse and re-establish the mean- ingfulness of religion to the living experience. It is not clear whether 138 Oliver Leaman, A Brief Introduction to Islamic Philosophy (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1999), 80-1. 354</page><page sequence="49">TASAWWUF AND REFORM IN PRE-MODERN ISLAMIC CULTURE 355 this intellectual dynamism had anything to do with the short Otto- man renaissance of the second half of the seventeenth century, encouraged by the K6prulu ministers. Apart from al-Maghribi's case, there is still no evidence to indicate any significant degree of asso- ciation between al-Kurani, and the Madinan group in general, and the Ottoman state circles. In any event, reformism and politics would soon discover their point of convergence, as the careers of Dihlawi and Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab would attest to.</page></plain_text>
