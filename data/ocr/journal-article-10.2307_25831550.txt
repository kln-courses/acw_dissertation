<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Twentieth Century 121 THE TWENTIETH CENTURY By T. V. Benn, Senior Lecturer in French in the University of Leeds i. General The 'literature' in this field continues to be very bulky. Sub jective criticism is restricted to a narrower group of writers than ten years ago, and less attention is paid to politics. But there is a growing campaign by Catholic writers who condemn, pity, warn, or annex. Studies of the lit. as such are not wanting, nevertheless: out standing contributions incl. an outline of the period by M. Bemol; and studies on the Orpheus myth by Eva Kushner, on poetry by A. Bosquet, and J. P. Weber, and on drama by P. Ginestier; and works on individual authors by D. W. Alden (Lacretelle), M. Genevoix (on himself), R. Gibson (R. Martin du Gard), N. N. Greene (Sartre), W. N. Ince (Valery), F. R. Jameson (Sartre), R. Mallet (Jammes), P. Meylan (Ramuz and Stravinsky); there are excellent articles by B. Guy (Peguy), P. Kolb, and J. G. Linn (Proust), Judith Robinson (Valery). Books from America are still preoccupied with existentialism, but drama is also being described for the less learned reader. Many investigators successfully beg access to MS. material which is in private hands. One hopes that efforts will be made to provide skilled supervision of this material for the future. Among memoirs only those of P. Leautaud (see below) and A. Salmon stand out. Salmon's Souvenirs sans fin, ^e epoque, 1920-40, Gallimard, 401 pp., make good and informative reading, esp. on Apollinaire, Fort, Gide, Jacob, Proust, and on art circles and journalism. The index gives about 850 names. H. Bosco's Un oubli moins profond, Gallimard, 336 pp., is miscellaneous recollections, not chronological. 2. Bibliography The present selection of items should be supplemented by the use of all the following, arranged in order of appearance: (1) Livres du mois, classified; (2) Biblio, in which items appear usually one month later, alphabetically by author, title and subject; (3) RHLF, quarterly, collected by R. Rancceur, and incl. articles in periodicals;</page><page sequence="2">122 French Studies (4) SFry quarterly, a select list with comments; (5) BCLF, with book reviews, and titles of articles; (6) PMLAy in May; (7) French VII, N.York, French Institute, the most extensive list of books and articles, and the only one for the 20th c. only: last issue i960; (8) O. Klapp, Bibl. d'hist. litt. franpaisey Frankfurt/Main, Kloster mann, which has achieved its second vol., for 1959-60, listing books and articles. (See the note on ref. books of this kind by R. Shackleton, FSy xv, 4.) 3. Essays and Studies D. Anet, Du sacreauprofane, Geneva, Perret-Gentil, i960, 79 pp., measures what has been lost, or changed, in presenting Greek drama in French dress?Sophocles in Anouilh, Antigone; in Giraudoux, Mectre; in Gide and Cocteau, CEdipe; Euripides in Racine, Phedre. All but Racine are seen to expand the Greek, omit the 'silences', introduce melodrama, the romanesque, psycho analysis or the cinema. L. Barjon, Mondes d'ecrivainsy destinies d'hommesy Casterman, i960, 320 pp., seeks religious aspirations among unbelievers, incl. Suares, Camus, Saint-Exupery. M. Bemol, Essai sur Vorientation des litt. de langue franpaise au XXe siecley Nizet, i960, 338 pp., gives a patient, unemphatic and thoughtful outline of the three periods 1900-14, 1914-39, 1939-57, in which he seeks to exemplify a struggle between forward and backward looking writers, and the union of historical and social forces with the 'expression du genie individuer; the writer leans on the latter: ' la puissance poetique propre a chaque personnalite .. .decide de tout' (p. 175). This does not make him any more favourable to Cocteau. There is a short note on the influence of Bergson, and good sections on surrealism, Giraudoux, and other main figures; short shrift for Romains. A. Blanchet, S.J., La Litt. et le spirituely IIIy Aubier, 319 pp., continues his sensitive essays in annexation, or appreciation 'quand meme', incl. Gide, Super vielle, Perse, Aragon, Camus, Mauriac, Montherlant, Simone de Beauvoir, Claudel; in each case a specific aspect is chosen: e.g. 'le pari d'A. Camus' (but it was Pascal who was right); Supervielle is the poet of space^ but his last attitude, in the essay, is that of prayer; Perse is prophetic, but unconscious of it; Mauriac the polemical writer must not be attacked, but 'il lui sera beaucoup pardonne' (p. 249). The book certainly seizes the spiritual straws,</page><page sequence="3">The Twentieth Century 123 and perceptively recommends what the good reader should ap preciate. G. Bonneville, Prophites et temoins de VEurope, Leyden, Sythoff, 183 pp., outlines the attitude of certain writers to the idea of Europe, incl. federation; one can be sure that what is quoted from R. Martin du Gard, Rolland, Gide, Valery, Benda, Drieu, Bernanos, and esp. Romains, is a fair presentation and not likely to be contradicted by any alternative quotations; the writer loyally refrains from 'annexing' Giraudoux and Ramuz. M. De caudin, 'Roman et cinema', RSH, 104, Oct./Dec, points out elements not easy to capture in the film?e.g. the first person, and the passage of time. Reine-Marie Desnues, Des auteurs et des hommes, Fleurus, 523 pp., frankly proposes to warn young Christians against the moral failings, greater or lesser, of Claudel, Gide, Proust, Duhamel, Maurois, Mauriac, Montherlant, Ber nanos, Green; after outlining their themes and tendencies, allowances are charitably made: Proust could not help describing a wicked world, the only one he knew; but original sin is implicit in his presentation of the hidden evil in all joy. E. Dutoit, Domaines, Fribourg, fids Universitaires, i960, 234 pp., reprints from the JG, with date of publ., 51 short essays, on Char, Aragon, Claudel, Gide, and a host of topics, providing at every turn illuminating suggestions, e.g. in the essay on mirrors, refs to Colette, Giraudoux, Baudelaire; on Lafcadio, to Baudelaire and Descartes. L. Guissard, A.A., Merits en notre temps, Fayard, 317 pp., describes without great precision and without page refs, Saint-Exupery, Ramuz, Claudel, Aragon, Malraux, Camus and Mauriac; they are approved when anti-communist; Ramuz's 'quete de l'humain' is sympathetically treated; Camus is regret tably not Christian. Eva Kushner, Le My the d'Orphee dans la litt. contempt Nizet, 363 pp., selects principally for discussion Segalen, Cocteau, Anouilh, Jouve, Emmanuel, but touches on many others, and the documentation is thorough. The outline of 'orphism' from Virgil to 1885 would make a sizeable book, and the bibl. reveals over 70 items after 1885. The transformations of the myth are cautiously interpreted as 'symptoms' arising from the authors and their period. B. Morrissette, 'Roman et cinema', S, xv, 2, using Robbe-Grillet as a pretext, suggests that cinema techniques are not as widespread in modern novels as is thought; after all, cinema techniques appear before the days of the cinema in the behaviouristic novel and even in Flaubert.</page><page sequence="4">i24 French Studies G. Mourgue, Dieu dans la litt. d'aujourd'hui, fids France Empire, 287 pp., maintains bluntly that unbelievers hide their real preoccupation with God and the immaterial; this book will reveal the authors to themselves. The recipients incl. Malraux, Sartre, Cocteau, Montherlant and about 20 others. H. Peyre, 'Contemp. feminine lit. in France', YFSy 27, rapidly reviews many names, with bold reappraisals; he treats Colette severely, and praises Paule Regnier and Colette Audry. G. Picon, UUsage de la lecture, 1-11, MF, 1960-1, ii + 267, and 303 pp.: in vol. 1, reprints reviews, 1946-57, on Camus, filuard, Michaux, Char, Malraux, Perse, Reverdy; in vol. 11: Gide, Valery, Camus, Giono, and about 15 others, and the 'nouveau roman'. His criticisms are often grudging (Camus lacks passion, filuard is an innovator full of tradition, Robbe-Grillet clever but false) though Reverdy, Giono, and Nathalie Sarraute are admired. He is puzzled by NadaPs revelation of La jfeune Parque. The bibl. is defective. A. Rousseaux, Litt. du XXe siecle, VII, Michel, 280 pp., reprints reviews on 16 French writers, publ. 1951-60, incl. Perse, Char, Breton, Butor, Sarraute, Robbe-Grillet, Cl. Simon, calmly giving credit where he can (Butor: 'ressources et limites'; Robbe Grillet: 'soin raffine' but no metaphysical sense; Sarraute: 'soin raffine' but 'personnages sans personnalite'). Whilst omitting the word 'perhaps', this critic does not deliver anathemas or discover subconscious ' grace' as some other religious writers do. E. Ronsjo, Romanciers franpais de Montesquieu a Camus, Stockholm, Almqvist, i960, 211 pp. P. Senart, 'Jalons pour le nouveau roman', TR, 169, Feb., sketches with partiality the development from Flaubert to Robbe-Grillet, but provides some interesting quotations. C. Schlotke-Schroder, 'Zur franzosischen Literatur entre les deux guerres: Problematik von Existenz und Pathos', ZFSL, lxxi, Nov., restricts the discussion of these concepts to their reflection in Gide and Proust. G. True, Hist, de la litt. catholique contemp., Casterman, 356 pp., provides a guide for Catholic readers to the chief Catholic writers, literary and other, starting with Chateaubriand, and stressing the 20th c, up to Montherlant (errant) and Emmanuel. Each chapter has extensive but untrustworthy bibl. notes on a host of additional persons. S. Ullmann, 'L'image litt.: quelques questions de methode', in Actes du VIHe congres, Fed. internat. des langues et litt. mod., Belles Lettres, illustrates from contemp. authors,</page><page sequence="5">The Twentieth Century 125 e.g. Proust and Giono, a variety of approaches, formal and func tional?with blame and praise for statisticians, and many pointers towards work to be done. 4. Poetry Anthologies continue to abound (to be identified in Biblio under: Arc-en-ciel, Flammes vives, Janet, Lippens, Parant, Pompidou, Seghers, etc.). One interesting experiment is: J. Nielloux (ed.), Sequences, anthologie permanente de poesie franpaise contemp., 1-11, Grassin, 1958-60, 160 and 255 pp., containing poems of high quality, and biog. notes, representing 46 and 90 writers respectively, and 32 prizewinners in a recent contest. Anna Balakian, 'La langue surrealiste', in Actes du Vllle Congres, Fed. internat. des langues et litt. mod., Belles Lettres, sketches the lines of future work on the use of tenses and of the infinitive, and esp. on the unnamed phenomenon, the associative 'accouplement.. .qui delivre la metaphore de ranalogie\ A. Bos quet, Verbe et vertige, situations de la poesie, Hachette, 375 pp., inquires, in clear language, whether poetry has changed its essence, from the Cartesian 'comprendre' of the period before Baudelaire and Nerval, to 'deviner, prolonger, subir' since then. He insists that poetry, 'Pinconnu spontane', cannot be defined, and yet it influences philosophy, not the converse. Special studies on these lines are made of Perse (non-Cartesian), Michaux (who only errs in rationalizing his mescaline experiments), Bonnefoy, Pessoa, Paz and Popa. Reverdy and Valery are treated as reactionaries. There is an anthology of 20th-c. texts about poetry. R. Gibson (ed.), Modern French Poets on Poetry, Cambridge U.P., xv + 292 pp., is a well produced and well annotated coll. of about 300 pronounce ments, by poets for the most part, from Baudelaire onwards. Well indexed, but clear sub-headings in the text would also facilitate ready reference. Monique Parent, Saint-John Perse et quelques devanciers, Klincksieck, i960, 260 pp., presents the result of tech nical inquiries on selected portions of the work of Bertrand, Jammes, Gide, Fort, Peguy and Perse. The subjects are various: incidence of parts of speech (with statistical calculations), 'ecarts syntaxiques', sentence-structure, intonation (but no ref. to the book by Coustenoble), rhythm; the kymograph and the tape recorder are used to analyse readings (by whom ?) of the passages selected. We are grateful for these precise records and observa</page><page sequence="6">126 French Studies tions, which are of absorbing interest; we shall be grateful for more, but this seems to depend on improving the machines to allow multiple rapid experiments with numerous executants, alongside parallel work on 'control' passages. Meanwhile, wisdom would lie in guarded conclusions garnished with reservations? not in retreat before a mystery (p. 106, etc.); many of the writer's crit. remarks do not seem to derive from the experiments but from presuppositions and intuitions, using the well-known vocabulary of appreciative crit. J.-P. Warner, Genese de Vceuvre poetique, Gallimard, i960, 564 pp., uses a psychoanalytical notion, and succeeds in tracing the apparently unconscious recrudescence of childhood memories in the poetry of certain authors. The 20th c. is represented by Valery (who was nearly drowned in a lake, sur rounded by swans); Claudel (climbing trees, and being weaned? 'le sein amer'); and Apollinaire (memories of adults preparing and eating food, especially poultry). These memories are described more elegantly by the writer, and a fortiori by the poets. The thesis that these events were of capital importance has force of persuasion and weight of evidence, but it is to be questioned whether the fixations discovered are indeed visible in all the quota tions put forward, and whether they are central or determinative, rather than one of many which remain to be discovered, perhaps by stylistic methods. 5. Drama The RHT continues its invaluable bibl. There was an Exposition Louis Jouvet at the B.N., Oct. 1961 to Jan. 1962; the Catalogue is issued by the library. The Annuaire du spectacle, Raoult, vi + 984 pp., is in its 16th year. W. Fowlie, Dionysus in Paris, a Guide to Contemp. French Theatre, Gollancz, 314 pp., is a fairly comprehensive introd., for non-specialists, about theatres, 'tragic' writers (Giraudoux, Coc teau, Montherlant, Anouilh), Claudel, the 'theatre of ideas' (Gide, Sartre, Camus, Green), and the recent writers (Artaud, Beckett, Genet, Adamov, Ionesco, Schehade). Written clearly, in lecture form, there are good formulas and reflections (e.g. on Cocteau and surrealism), a useful bibl. for English readers and an index of authors and titles. P. Ginestier, Le Theatre contemp. dans le monde, essai de critique esthetique, PUF, viii + 254 pp., rigorously applies to 41 plays (plus Athalie), a system by which their archi</page><page sequence="7">The Twentieth Century 127 tecture ('geometrie dramatique,) is sketched, and traced on dia grams, which are certainly illuminating, applicable to teaching, and likely to lead to fruitful discussion. About 30 of the plays are French. D. I. Grossvogel, 20th c. French drama, Columbia U.P., 'paperback', is none other than The Self-Conscious Stage, Columbia U.P., 1958. One discovers this on purchasing the vol.; the procedure seems inadmissible. J. Guicharnaud and June Beckelman, Modern French Theatre, Yale U.P., xii + 305 pp., gives essays on Giraudoux, Cocteau, and Claudel who present the super natural; on Montherlant, Anouilh, Salacrou, Sartre and Camus, who bring us back to man; and on seven revolutionaries ending with Ionesco and Beckett. These objective sketches for English non-specialists present views on the predominantly 'dark' writers supposedly out of favour in America. There is a useful book-list and index of first performances. Jane W. Malin, Surrealism in the French Theatre between the Two Wars (summary in DisA, xxii, 6), traces surrealism in Vitrac, and (diluted) in Artaud, Neveux, Cocteau, Salacrou. The two latter later 'became excellent play wrights'. P. Surer, 'fitudes sur le theatre francais contemp., XI: Le theatre tragique', IL, xiii, 2 and 4, continues the art. in xii, 4, and deals shortly with Mauriac ('trop de fiel'), Montherlant ('le sublime'; some of his plays are Christian); Sartre (facility, 'dated', horrific), Camus (too intellectual); these notes seem to be intended for class teaching. 6. Authors alain. Biblio, xxix, 8, gives articles, bibl. and photos. MF, cccxlii, June, has 2 articles containing valuable reminiscences, and 2 unpubl. pieces by A. A.'s Portraits de famille, MF, 205 pp., is a new coll. of pieces mainly describing A.'s childhood, family and schooling, and incl. his revision of a study of J. Lagneau; written between 1925 and 1946. P. Senart, 'Bernanos et A.', TR, 164, Sept., draws attention to the pro- and anti-war controversy between these writers, in Rouen in 1914. anouilh. LSocadia (with Humulus), and Becket, have been publ. by Harrap, with quite informative introd. (except as regards 'style'). C. Borgal, 'J.A., technicien du neant', Crit, xvii, 165, attacks A.'s philosophy and suggests that his techniques are standard ones, or borrowed. D. J.

M. Decaudin, 'A. europeen', RLCy xxxv, 2, reports commemorations in Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Italy. Sally N. Lawall, 'A.'s "La maison des morts"', RR, Hi, 2, traces A.'s transformation of a short story of 1907 into a poem in Alcools (1913), principally as regards patterning; more work could profitably be done on these texts. R. Warnier, 'Anthologies italiennes d'A.', xxxv, 2, discusses their merits and contribution. Id., 'Ricciotto Canudo, 1879-1923, dans Pentourage de G.A.', SFr, v, 2 (no. 14), gives a well-documented account of their rela tionship, and of C. himself?an active intermediary and writer undeservedly obscure. aragon.

Vandromme, A., Gallimard, i960, 317 pp., provides the usual range of essays and docs, proper to the Bibl.

Chadwick, 'Waiting for Godot: a logical approach', S, xiv, 4, makes excellent use of an array of evidence suggesting that Godot and Pozzo mean 'God', the tramps the 'godless', and Lucky a communicant.

Ode a Charles Fourier, Klincksieck, ii + 99 pp., is a thorough piece of detective work, decoding a host of allusions in an attempt to clarify the text. The introd. is valuable for its account of Fourier's ideas and influences, and of the relationship between 'fourierisme' and surrealism. butor. In 'L'usage des pronoms personnels dans le roman', TM, 178, Feb., B. sketches the simple and complex uses novelists can make of 3rd, 1st and 2nd person narrative (one remembers La Modification), with a note on 'le "Je" de Descartes'; and he speculates on a method to 'faire parler des groupements humains' (p. 948). P. Deguise, 'M.B. et le nouveau roman', FR, xxxv, Dec, presents carefully and straightforwardly the main problems attacked in B.'s novels. J.-L. Seylaz, 'La tentative romanesque de M.B.', Etudes de lettres, iii, 4, i960, well-knit account of B.'s experiments in the representation of time recalled?strictly an impossible task. B.'s effort is named a' roman critique' (p. 217), or 'realisme mythologique', a less successful term quoted from Crit, Feb. 1958. B.'s attempt to fix the past, as it is seen at different moments, demands new techniques, one of which is a form of repetition. L. Spitzer, 'Quelques aspects de la technique des romans de M.B. (I)', ArL, xiii, 2, deals with B.'s Emploi du temps, and on the principle that 'telle conception engendre telle tech nique', examines the modes of expression which correspond with the author's aim, which is to render the confused and passionate effort, and the vanity of that effort, to reconstitute past events. Thus we get a meandering syntax, imprecise cross-refs to related events, reiterations of items and of constructions. Ref. is made to similar techniques in Proust and Peguy. (The difference would seem to be that in these authors the labyrinthine sentences do follow through to a positive and triumphant conclusion.) camus. Les Justes was ed. by E. O. Marsh, Harrap, i960, 108 pp., with useful introd. and notes. The RHT, xii (i960), 4, has several invaluable contributions: an outline by A. Alter of C.'s view of justice; notes by Nina Gourfinkel on his adaptation of Dostoyevsky; first-hand evidence and docs, by J. Negroni and R.

Borel, 'Nature et histoire chez A.C, Crit, xvii, 169, June, rightly stresses the notions of 'monde' and 'mesure', in C, and insists that 'C. depasse la notion de l'absurde'; but the art. is more difficult to read than C. Simone Crepin, A.C, essai de bibl., Brussels, Commission Beige de bibl., is valuable and timely. S. Doubrovsky, 'C. et l'Amerique', NRF, 98, Feb., is one of this writer's meaty, interesting and factual contributions. G. Kamber, 'The allegory of the names in U Stranger', MLQ, xxii, 3, finds some implications, mostly speculative, and gives a rather non-committal extract from corr. with C. Rosette C. Lamont, 'The Anti-Bourgeois', FR, xxxiv, 5, Apr., finds in C. a perpetual struggle against bourgeois comfort, and gives a one sided but perceptive interpretation of 'Jonas', La Chute, etc. Yvette Louria, '"Dedoublement" in Dostoevsky and C, MLR, lvi, 1, compares Golyadkin in The Double, and Clamance. J. Onimus, 'C. adapte a la scene Faulkner et Dostoievski', RSH, 104, Oct./Dec, seeks, through these examples, the 'difference specifique' between novels and plays, by observing what is omitted, and what is added: a clear and important statement. Les Possedes, from D.'s The Demons, is shown, incidentally, to be less successful than the Requiem from F. P.-H. Simon, Presence de C, Nizet, 183 pp., reprints 7 essays, publ. 1949-60, which attempt loyally to see C.'s thought broadly; without hiding a Catholic viewpoint, the writer is generous, even warm, in view of C.'s 'humanite'. He shows honesty in being puzzled by La Chute, suspects some ambivalence, and indeed suggests that in many sentences C.'s meaning requires a 'point d'ironie' instead of a full stop. claudel. P.C.?Darius Milhaud, corr. 1912-53, Gallimard, Cahiers P.C, 373 pp., gives about 300 letters (with cuts), an invaluable introd., based on personal knowledge, by J.

Les Caves du Vatican was ed. by F. J. Jones, U.L.P., 239 pp., with useful facts and notes for school purposes. The NRF, ix, 105, Sept., publ. a corr. with C.-L.

Two inquiries, one in Arts, 803, 4/10 Jan., the other in RDM, 4, Feb., ask 'Que reste-t-il de G. ?'; the answer seems to be 'a good deal', shown by the replies of younger writers, and the figures for library borrowings. Gerd Lamsfuss, Der Asthetizismus A.G.s in der Krisis der dsthetischen Bildung, Miinster, Aschendorff, vii + 439 pp., describes G.'s philosophical and other ideas, as related to those of Goethe, Schopenhauer, Fichte, Valery: dreams, metaphysics, atheism, according to the subject-matter of the work of G. under considera</page><page sequence="13">The Twentieth Century 133 tion; but with no evidence of French influences; there is a service able bibl., but no index. G. Michaud, G. et VAfrique, fids du Scorpion, 192 pp., balances the good and evil results of G.'s journeys to Algeria and the Congo; a serious essay, but without new material and without page refs. Irene Vilde-Lot, 'A.G. et P"art d'ecrire" d'apres les variantes des Nourritures terrestres...', FM, xxviii (i960), 4, and xxix, 1, 2 and 3, classifies G.'s corrections, demonstrating statistically and otherwise the progress made by G. in avoiding excess and achieving rhythm and harmony (grouping and balance of sounds and syllables), even sacrificing linguistic accuracy; with proper caution, this euphony is not attributed to a natural 'delicatesse d'oreille'. 'Style' is curiously defined as 'la clarte, Peconomie et le relief de P ex pression'. Some errors in previous work are corrected, incl. Naville's bibl.; misprints are said to be less frequent in current cheap eds of G. than in the (Euvres Completes or the Aveline ed. Ruth B.

Walker, 'Myth in G.'s Le Chant du monde\ S, xv, 2, gives examples of implications (here named 'myths'): symbols, metaphors, pagan superstitions (e.g. 'le sort de la terre' is an unexplained illness; a journey symbolizes life; a traveller's return is a 'life-cycle'; winter is death; 'la mere de ble' is burnt in spring). Mention could have been made of G.'s early reading of Greek classics. giraudoux.

We are left with our hunger, for this pamphlet gives us general conclusions only, and no evidence. Marie-Jeanne Durry, L'Univers de G., MF, 59 pp., is an allusive essay on G.'s women, paradoxes, inconclusiveness, and magic. A. Fongaro, ' Le theatre de G.', LMy xi, 5, analyses thoroughly and cogently certain general tendencies in G.'s thought: e.g. the conflict between human, daily life, and aspirations towards the non-human (non human incl. Demokos as well as Jupiter); the non-human is usually revealed as false. The writer seems to be unreconciled to the various forms of G.'s wit. J. Voisine, 'Trois Amphitryons modernes', ALMy no. 35, 52 pp., makes the useful discovery that G. used a modified version, by W. Henzen (ed. of 1903), of Kleist's Amphitryon (Henzen, borrowing someone's erudition, counted his play as no. 36; no. 37 is unknown). ionesco. An ed. of Rhinoceros, N.Y., Holt, has a pref. by I., and can be obtained with a record of four of the scenes, and a tape-recording of the pref. with 'extemporaneous remarks', by I. himself. R. N.

C. J.

Gaps in our knowledge are frankly pointed out: more work of this kind would be a healthy sign. J.

Kolb, 'P.'s portrait of Jaures in Jean Santeuil\ FS, xv, 4, shows by means of an excellent documentation that Couzon is modelled on Jaures (incidentally Norpois on Hanotaux), and that the inter vention in the Chamber of Deputies is a transposition of a real incident; and that politics, and Jaures, do not reappear in A la Recherche..., where the 'heroes' are restricted*to artists. J. G. Linn, 'Notes on P.'s manipulation of chronology', RR, lii, 3, traces carefully the 'markers' inserted by P., to show the passage of time; there are inconsistencies, and some events cannot be identified (e.g. the 'reprise' of a play often revived). The sug gestion is made that P. pictured Marcel as about 11 years younger than himself, but sometimes used 'markers' from his own life.

Be that as it may, a biog. account emerges, and, better still, R. himself gives, chap, by chap., 80 pages of corrections or new facts, e.g. regarding Knock, R.'s papers destroyed by the Gestapo, his schooling, Cromedeyre, Louis Bastide, Laon and Lucienne, R.'s relations with Apollinaire, Gide, and the NRF, the 1940 pen club episode, the Academy. A. E. A.

Whilst rejecting the help of psychologists, A. decides that S.-E.'s frequent refs to sterile matter must have their source in dreams. The section on style is not helpful. Renee Zeller, La Grande Quite d'A.de S.-E., Alsatia, 224 pp., does not appear to provide any new matter, though the author had access to unpubl. material; a Catholic viewpoint is evident, and a moralizing intention.

Stephane, Le Dossier S., Laffont, 143 pp. Fallois provides a rambling eulogy, and bibl.; Stephane is much slighter; Ritzen is the pseud, of a neurologist, and his contribution is more valuable: it is a 'psychobiographie' inspired by Delay (on Gide). The three book-lists need to be collated; Ritzen adds information about the regions described in S.'s novels. suARte. AS. et A.

Anne Blanchard, 'Le silence de P.V.', CS, t. li, 361, uses the Cahiers to follow the preoccupations of V. in the so-called silent years: 'se penser pensant', a search for the nature of the' possible', of consciousness; a mysticism without God, etc. A. R. Chisholm, 'V.'s "fibauche d'un serpent"', AUMLA, 15, provides a very satisfying explana tion of the 'logic' of the poem, its internal consistency, its double meanings; and speculation on the possible identity of the serpent with V. The stylistic side is only adumbrated. F. Fosca, De Diderot a V., les icrivains et les arts visuels, Michel, 304 pp., praises V. highly for his apposite reflections and his criticism of artists (Corot, Delacroix, Degas, etc.). Renee G. Geen, P.V. and the Civilisation of the 18th c. (summary in DisA, xxii, 4, p. 1174), classifies V.'s statements, incl. those in certain Cahiers, and con cludes that V.'s evocations (e.g. on Montesquieu's elliptical style)</page><page sequence="20">140 French Studies are good, but not his general criticism. W. N. Ince, The Poetic Theory of P.V.: Inspiration and Technique, Leicester U.P., ix+ 188 pp., is a thoroughly documented thesis (of 1955, revised to 1959), orderly, abstract and objective. It examines the changes in V.'s views, from unqualified opposition to 'inspiration', to a form of 'personal inspiration'; some related subjects are discussed: e.g. post-1920 mathematics, and V.'s main problem regarding the 'fonctionnement d'ensemble' of the mind. Many passages quoted from V. are not as easy to understand as the writer assumes and would not suffer from an incidental 'explication'. J. R. Lawler, 'T. S. Eliot et P.V.', MF, cccli, 1169, Jan., recounts their meetings and discusses E.'s crit. of V., usually admirative but not always comprehending. Agnes E. Mackay, The Universal Self: a Study of P.V., Routledge, 283 pp., treats V. as though he were a mystic sage, whose cryptic words are best explained cryptically; there is an outline of some previous philosophers, not clearly connected, and we do not hear much about V.'s 'self for over 100 pages. Interpretations sometimes go beyond the text interpreted. The chapters on poetics and composition are useful summaries. E. von Richthofen, Commentaire sur 'Mon Faust' de P.V., PUF, iv + 140 pp., sensibly avoids any general interpretation, and gives instead hasty but rich and valuable notes on words, phrases, and sentences: elucidations, alternative meanings, or parallel expressions from V. (incl. the Cahiers i-xxiii) and elsewhere; with a bibl. Judith Robinson, 'The place of literary and artistic creation in V.'s thought', MLR, lv, 4, shows that much remains to be clarified, with the help of the Cahiers. This valuable art. confirms that V. was not primarily intent on expository writing, but on under standing the working of the mind, mathematically instead of anthropomorphically; the composition of poems was thus a de rivative, or an experiment by which the process could be observed. Incidentally, the traditional 'nuit de Genes' and 'grand silence' recede as interpretations, in view of the continuity and consistency of the Cahiers from 1892 to 1938 and after. Id., 'Language, physics and mathematics in V.'s Cahiers', MLR, lv, 4, is an unusual and invaluable demonstration of the vigour and originality of V.'s thought: his brave attempt to find means to express ideas, using 'pure' signs, like those in modern mathematics, which indicate relationships, thus avoiding our anthropomorphic lan guage which leads to the creation of false problems. It is sug</page><page sequence="21">The Twentieth Century 141 gested, incidentally, that V.'s notion of the mind as a self-regulating structure makes him a precursor of cybernetics. H. Yvon, 'A propos d'un "ecart" de P.V.', FM, xxix, 2, discusses the syntax of subordinates beginning with si, V.'s motive for writing ' Si je ne fus, tu devais etre mort* in Mon Faust, and his statement that a writer is 'un ecart, un agent d'ecarts*.</page></plain_text>
