TIHLE QUARTERLY REVIEW of BIOLOGY "DERIVED" ACTIVITIES; THEIR CAUSATION, BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE, ORIGIN, AND EMANCIPATION DURING EVOLUTION BY N. TINBERGEN Department of Zoology, Oxford University I. INTRODUCTORY; A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE ETHOLOGY OF INSTINCTS #-T- HIS paper is an attempt at an explana- tion of certain types of behavior, many of them elements of threat, courtship, or other types of display, the origin of which has long been obscure, but is now gradually becoming known. The attempt is based on our knowledge of the nature of innate behavior, which gradually is emerging through the work of K. Lorenz and his collaborators. It is necessary to present a short sketch of what we know about innate behavior in general before attempting to apply this knowl- edge to the phenomena here collectively named "derived activities." This sketch will be neces- sarily summary. For a fuller treatment I must refer to various papers by Lorenz (1935, 1937, 1943, 1950) and by myself (1942, 1950), and to my book on The Study of Instinct (1951). Part of this paper, particularly the section on the analysis of displacement activities, is a revised English edition of a paper written in German (Tinbergen, 1940). The present paper takes some new facts into account and gives new, and I think more correct, interpretations of some problems which were treated unsatisfactorily in 1940. The starting point of all theories on instinct has been the everyday observation that animals perform movements that contribute, often in an amazingly refined way, towards maintenance of individual, group, or species. The first steps toward understanding are two obvious, though largely negative conclusions: (1) Many of these behavior patterns need not be learned, but are entirely or largely innate; they are often performed in full by individuals reared in isolation, who cannot have had opportunity to learn them; and (2) innate behavior may "go wrong," that is, miss its objective, without the animal doing anything to correct itself. Such observations show that the animal has no "insight," or very little, into the relation between its behavior and the result ob- tained. Because we human beings like to believe that our own behavior is entirely guided by in- sight or knowledge of this type-a widespread fallacy due to overestimation of "reason"-the spectacle of behavior going wrong impresses and puzzles us. These considerations make us realize that animal behavior cannot be explained anthropomorphi- cally. The behavior of animals puzzles many of us even more than our own behavior, and this leads us to the basic problem: what causes the innate, and yet so effective, behavior of animals? Briefly, present knowledge amounts to the fol- lowing. I</page><page sequence="2">2 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Behavior, with very few exceptions which need not concern us here, is coordinated muscular movement. Each contraction of skeletal muscles is the effect of stimulation by motor nerves- again, with very few exceptions which are irrele- vant for the present purpose. The impulses passed on by motor nerves towards the muscles come from the central nervous system. The coordination, or patterning, of muscular movements is largely due to patterning of the impulses leaving the central nervous system. The central nervous system per- haps discharges these impulses in part spon- taneously, on its own accord; it further acts in response to stimuli either from the outside (usually impinging upon the animal through its sense or- gans) or from within. Such agents from within are in some cases hormones, in other cases internal sensory stimuli. These internal factors, sometimes together with external stimuli, activate a "drive" or an "urge" in the animal. We know now that behavior is rarely pure "reaction." The readiness to react to certain releasing stimuli varies in time, according to the degree of activation of the drives. The internal factors are more or less specific; for instance, sex hormones activate the reproduc- tive drive but not the feeding drive. An activated drive causes specific searching behavior; the ani- mal starts "spontaneously" and searches until a situation is found which provides the specific stimuli releasing end-activities belonging to that drive. For instance: a hungry duck hawk starts searching for prey spontaneously; it is then susceptible to the sight of prey, but not, or less so, to the sight of a mate. The stimuli provided by a flock of teal release a specific response be- longing to the feeding drive: actual attack. I have used the term "spontaneous" with refer- ence to two different systems. When I said that an animal often acts spontaneously I meant that the factors responsible for action are not outside stimuli but internal factors; I referred to the animal as a whole. When I said that the central nervous system probably acts spontaneously, this was meant to say that the internal factors causing the central nervous system to discharge its motor impulse patterns need not always be factors out- side the nervous system, such as hormones, but may in part be active within the central nervous system itself. "Spontaneity" of the animal as a whole is an established fact; "spontaneity" of the central nervous system, a part of the animal, has not been proved, though it seems probable. In studies on animal behavior one often meets with the idea that certain movements are due to "general excitement." I think it is very doubtful whether excitement (by which is usually meant readiness to act) is ever really general, that is, affects all drives equally. If the evidence upon which such assertions are based is scrutinized critically, it is clear that there is no question of all the drives being activated at the same time. Almost always the increased readiness to act is confined to either fighting, or mating, or feeding, or escape. It is true that sometimes fighting and mating and even all the other reproductive drives are activated at the same time, but then the non-reproductive drives are in a state of low activation. And since we know (Hess, 1944) that sleep is also dependent on a drive, on activity of certain parts of the nervous svstem, the term "general excitement" is even more absurd, for if it were general it would affect sleep as well. An animal, "excited" in this general sense, should go to sleep more easily than under conditions of lower "general" excitement, and this is contrary to the observed facts. Excitement can be more or less specific, or less or more general, but there is a limit, and only rarely is more than one drive activated. Because now one drive, now another may be activated in an animal, we need a word to indicate this state of activation and to relate it to the drive. For this I will use the words "motivation" and "motivated," following American usage. As an equivalent of the lengthy expression "the sexual drive of the animal is activated" I will say "the animal is sexually motivated." This motiva- tion may be strong or weak. The specificity of the drives has led to the concept of "reaction specific energy." This concept has aroused criticism from various sides. It would lead too far to discuss this problem here; I merely want to stress that "reaction" should be under- stood in its widest sense, as "behavior pattern." It may, but it need not, be a simple movement, it may be mere "readiness to act," and it must not be pure reaction but "action-and-reaction-in- one." For these reasons the term "drive-specific energy" would be preferable; some use the term "specific action potential." Concluding, it is a matter of simple observation that an animal is often driven to action from within, and that this inner urge or drive can be of different kinds, each giving rise to a different be-</page><page sequence="3">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 3 havior pattern. It is this fact, the specificity of drives, which is to be kept in mind when an at- tempt has to be made to explain behavior, es- pecially of the type usually termed displacement activities (with which the greater part of this paper is concerned). The various drives of an animal are always fluctuating in strength. They are, if strongly activated, mutually exclusive: the animal usually does "one thing at a time." That is to say, how- ever variable its movements may be, even from one second to the next, there is usually some consistency: once a drive has been strongly aroused, the animal obeys it for some time, and is not likely to shift suddenly to another activity, unless forced to do so by a very powerful stimulus. This consistency is, however, as a rule a matter of minutes, or hours. In the course of a day an animal does a variety of things: now the feeding drive is predominant, causing the animal to search or even to migrate for food, now the escape drive is activated, now the sleeping drive. Some of these drives show a regular daily or, in the case of the reproductive drive, a seasonal rhythm, others are usually "kept in reserve" until an overriding ex- ternal stimulus releases them, as is often (though by no means always) the case in the fleeing drive. This relatively simple system, of internal fac- tors causing spontaneous search and increased readiness to respond to specific outside stimuli, gives rise to an amazingly varied repertoire of behavior. This variety is due to a number of cir- cumstances which are to be kept in mind con- tinuously during a study of behavior. Some of these complications are: (1) Hierarchy. Each drive is a hierarchical sys- tem, divided in subordinated drives of a more restricted type than the general drive. For in- stance, the reproductive drive of most birds, if activated, controls a number of activities: court- ing, mating, defence of territory, nest-building, incubation, etc. There is definite order in these activities. The first result of the activation of the reproductive drive in a male passerine bird, for instance, is migration towards the breeding area. Such directed, preparatory behavior, leading to a special situation, is called appetitive behavior. When a suitable territory is reached this ap- petitive behavior comes to an end, and the bird begins to sing with full force. He roams around the territory on the lookout for females and for intruding males. He is ready to react to both, but with different behavior patterns. As soon as he spots an intruding male, his fighting drive is released. If a female appears, his courting drive is released. Both these partial patterns, however different they may be, are kept in readiness; usu- ally they can only be released by stimuli from the intruding male or the female, as the case may be. In addition, however, both are susceptible to release by these stimuli only because the major reproductive drive as a whole is activated. The fighting drive, or subdrive, itself does not control merely one simple movement; it gives rise to a special form of appetitive behavior (flying aggressively towards the intruder) followed by one of several possible forms of aggression: pos- turing, attack, or chase. The form of aggressive behavior actually shown depends on the strength of the drive in the territory owner, and on what the other male does, which means, on which external stimuli impinge upon the attacking male. These and similar facts show that the repro- ductive drive is a hierarchical system. The causal system underlying it is arranged in levels. Some factors are responsible for the activation of the reproductive drive as a whole. In male song-birds of our zone, sex hormones are among the internal factors; rise in temperature in spring, releasing migration, is one of the external factors. Once the reproductive drive is activated and migration has brought the bird into a territory, it is ready to react, by various subordinated patterns such as courting or fighting, to specific stimuli which have a more restricted effect than those releasing the reproductive system as a whole. When these more restricted stimuli have switched the bird into, say, attack, it reacts to still more specific stimuli by a special type of attack. Again, I should like to stress the need to keep theory and fact well apart. While a theory evolved upon these facts, which might be called a "center- theory" and which will not be elaborated here, may be proven to be at least oversimplified, I do not think we can doubt the existence of a hierarchical organization of drives. For our present purpose it is sufficient to point out that, when a certain drive is activated, the behavior to be expected, though limited to movements belonging to that drive, can be of many different types. Which type is shown depends on which subdrive, and sometimes on which part of this subdrive, is activated. Thus it is obvious that in order to</page><page sequence="4">4 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLGY understand the causal relationships underlying behavior it is necessary to know a variety of factors and their influence, factors acting on the various levels of the hierarchical system. It is also possible to develop the same conclusion about the hierarchical structure in another way. I will take the incubation of eggs in the herring gull as an example. It has been shown by experi- ments that incubation in this species depends on external stimuli from the nest and from the eggs. The eggs stimulate by their being in the nest, and by their rounded shape. To these stimuli the bird responds by brooding, which is a special way of sitting upon them. The ventral feathers are ruffled, and by making waggling movements in a more or less squatting position the bird shuffles these feathers around the eggs, which are thus brought into contact with the naked skin. This response is dependent on the internal state of the bird as well: it must be "broody." From experiments with other birds we know that broodiness is a conse- quence of the presence of at least one hormone, prolactin. Now brooding is not the only reaction of a broody bird. When the arrangement of the eggs is disturbed, the bird reacts to the changed touch-stimuli which it receives while sitting on the eggs, by rising, bending its head down, and shifting the eggs with the bill. It then sits down again, and if the touch stimuli are still not satis- factory, it will shift the eggs once more. This is repeated until the eggs are well arranged. This reaction also is controlled by the internal state: again, only a broody bird does it. A third reaction is the rolling-in of eggs lying outside the nest-cup. Rolling is a reaction to a visual stimulus-situa- tion, "egg outside the nest." This response is also controlled by the state of broodiness. The striking point is that, although each of these three responses depends on a specific stimu- lus situation, they are all dependent on "broodi- ness" in general. Broodiness is the state into which the bird is brought by prolactin, and, probably, by some external stimulus as well, but the pattern to which it gives rise is varied, and consists of at least three types of response each governed by its own releasing stimulus situation. (2) Intensity. The form of a movement shown in a certain situation may vary immensely with the variation in intensity of the drive. Although in some cases the responsiveness of an animal may be a matter of all or none, of eating or not eating, or of attacking or non-attacking, in most cases there is a gradation of intensities of response. This is easily seen when the various intensity stages differ in degree, as in the case of the loudness of an alarm call. A weak disturbing stimulus, such as a distant human being, releases in a herring gull a scarcely audible, high-pitched "hehe." As the intruder approaches the call will become gradually louder. Its pitch may change a little, also the number of syllables will increase from a mere two to four or five, but no observer has any trouble in recognizing the same call through- out. This however is rather the exception. Usually, increasing intensity will result in the addition of elements to the movement. Good examples can be seen in nest-building behavior. A newly mated female bunting, for instance, will show the first signs of the tendency to build by occasionally picking up a straw. On the first day, this will be all, and she will drop the straw almost immediately after picking it up. Next day, she may carry it along for some time. The day after that she may carry it for a longer time, and even go to a typical nesting place, but drop it there. With still growing intensity, she will carry it to a nesting place, and will begin to build. In this case, the gradation from the vestige to the more complete pattern facilitates interpretation as an intensity sequence. This is more difficult when the next higher in- tensity stage of a type of behavior consists in a radical change of response, as for instance when a crab, with growing lack of oxygen in the water, will change from normal breathing merely with increased frequency to "emergency respiration," which is quite a different pattern. Or, when we approach the nest of a European blackbird, the male will first give a soft but penetrating, long- drawn, squeaking call. When we approach more closely, it will change to the well-known repeated "tjook-tjook-tjook," which, upon still closer approach, will change into the loud, yelling "'cheeng-cheeng-cheengcheeng-cheeng" and ac- companying "nervous" movements, even a charge. It is not only the motor pattern that changes, but also, as is well known, the responsiveness to external stimuli. Very hungry animals, or sexually very strongly motivated animals, will react to objects which would not evoke any response in a state of lower motivation. This may lead to reactions to inadequate objects, that is to say objects with which the biological end of the drive cannot be attained, such as inedible food, or females or chicks of different species, etc. When</page><page sequence="5">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 5 a very strong drive causes an animal to react to suboptimal stimulus situations we may speak, following Armstrong (1950), of overflow activities. In extreme cases an activity may even be per- formed without the situation providing any of the normally required sign-stimuli at all, and then the term "explosions" or "vacuum activities" is used. Thus variation in the intensity of the reaction may be due to variation of the strength of the drive. This in turn may be the outcome of varia- tion in internal state, or of variation of the ex- ternal situation, or (usually) both. Sometimes the variation of the intensity may be most obvious in the type of movement shown, in other cases in the degree of selectiveness towards external stimuli. Usually, we observe both. (3) Ambivalence. The picture is further compli- cated by the occurrence of ambivalent behavior. Although very strong motivation leads to one type of behavior to the exclusion of all other types, moderate motivation may allow the animal to obey two drives simultaneously. If, then, the environmental situation offers stimuli acting upon parts of two different drives, a mixture of two behavior patterns may be the result. For instance, a female stickleback arriving in a male's territory evokes attack and courtship at the same time, and a mixture of incipient attack and incipient leading-to-the-nest is the result. A herring gull offered a red egg in the nest will be stimulated to brood it by its rounded shape, but the red color will cause it to peck at it, since it has the tendency to remove red objects from the nest. Such be- havior may seem puzzling and unpredictable at first, but when one knows the brooding pattern and the reaction of carrying objects away from the nest, and also the optimal stimuli to which these two patterns normally respond, one is able to recognize the behavior as a mixture of two responses, and to explain it on the basis of one's knowledge of the effective environmental factors. As I will show below, one of the threat postures of the herring gull is such a mixture of two responses. (4) Finally, variation in movement may be due to change in position of outside objects towards which the animal orients itself. For instance, a territory-holding male song-bird may shift its favorite singing tree. This may be taken as un- predictable behavior until one finds that a new neighbor settled close to the new singing post has absorbed the owner's aggressive attention and caused him to move. Much of so-called "random behavior" is not ran- dom at all, but steered from step to step by out- side stimuli. Herring gulls flying home over the irregular dune scenery do not follow a straight course, but a very irregular one. The deviations from the true course are governed to minute de- tail by the updraughts caused by the impact of the wind on the irregular sand hills. Consequently their route changes with changing wind. In these and many similar cases it is our lack of knowledge of the influential outside stimuli that makes the movements appear random. It is not a scientific method to bring forward unanalysed observations as a support of the alleged impos- sibility to explain behavior. The student of behavior should seek to explain behavior, and not to prove that it cannot be explained. This outline of the causation of innate behavior, sketchy though it may be, is, I think, sufficient to demonstrate that the principles mentioned account for behavior' of great complexity. It may also make clear that a thorough study of the manifold factors, internal and external, and of their influence on behavior under various con- ditions of motivation, is required before a con- clusion about the adequacy of this outline is justified. Such a study, even if confined to one species, takes years. When it has been completed, it is surprising to what extent and in what detail one can predict the behavior, provided the cir- cumstances are known. In the two species I know best, the herring gull and the three-spined stickle- back, I can usually predict the behavior of any individual with fair accuracy. To mention just one instance: when a territory-holding male herring gull sees another male coming towards him, I can predict that he will stretch his neck, point his bill down, walk towards the intruder, and, upon reaching him, will peck into the ground and pull at moss or grass. If this fails to stop the intruder, the owner will attack him, by pecking at him and beating him with his wings. This possibility of prediction-always the most decisive test of a theory-seems to me to be a most encouraging testimony of the value of this type of study. Of course it is impossible to say at present what gaps and errors it still contains; for such an evaluation we simply lack the necessary (actual evidence. However extensive the data may be</page><page sequence="6">6 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY which have been brought to light by Heinroth, Lorenz, and many others, we need still many more facts so that we may test the present tentative conclusions and if necessary change them. This, however, cannot be done on the basis of frag- mentary, incidental, or superficial observations. A stage has been reached now at which systematic and thorough research, both observational and experimental, is required. II. "IRRELEVANT" ACTS Now, assuming that I have convinced the reader that following an intensive study of a given spe- cies the observer can predict what will happen under certain known conditions, he will appreciate the surprise one gets when the animal obviously acts contrary to the prediction. It is, for instance, contrary to expectation when two skylarks, en- gaged in furious combat, suddenly peck at the ground as if they were feeding; it is equally sur- prising when starlings during a territorial fight begin to preen their feathers, only to resume their fight a few seconds afterwards. It is "odd" when courting ducks suddenly interrupt their courtship to do some hasty preening, or when fighting her- ring gulls go through the motions of collecting nest material immediately after and immediately before an actual attack. The movements shown appear "irrelevant," entirely out of context with the behavior immediately preceding or following them. We are so used to what I have called above the consistency of behavior that such a sudden interruption without any obvious external stimu- lus, so contradictory to our general experience, comes as a challenge. When such irrelevant behavior is observed once, it may be taken even by an experienced observer to be a result of an unaccountable, sudden shift in the kind of the animal's motiva- tion, however surprising such a sudden and short shift may be. However, irrelevant acts occur often and in many species, and when a species is studied thoroughly it is soon obvious that there is a certain regularity in the occurrence of irrelevant acts; indeed, a given irrelevant act is often typical of a particular set of conditions. The irrelevancy is found in the fact that al- though an animal is clearly in fighting motivation, or, in other cases, in mating motivation-in general, when instinct "a" is activated-and although we know by experience that we must expect movements belonging to the executive pattern of this instinct "a," we observe move- ments belonging to the executive pattern of another instinct, "b." The activity seems to be displaced from instinct "b," to which it belongs, to instinct "a" which uses it as if it were a part of its executive pattern. In my first paper on this subject (1939b) I used the term "substitute activity" already used by Kirkman (1937). Kortlandt (1940) in- vented the German term "Uebersprungbewegung." This could be rendered by Makkink's term "sparking-over," used in a slightly different context (1936). Since I was told by American colleagues that "substitute activity" had already a different meaning in psychology, and since "sparking-over" seemed a little clumsy, especially in composite terms, I asked Dr. Huxley, Dr. Thorpe, and Mr. Armstrong to provide me with a good English term, and they agreed on "dis- placement activity" (1946). This term has been in general use since then and it seems to me that it would be wise to stick to it even though, as Armstrong (1956) argues, it may not be ideal. The genuine activity, that is the activity when caused by its proper drive, has been called by Kortlandt the "autochthonous" activity. The displacement activity derived from it, that is to say the same activity when caused by another than its proper drive, may be called "allochtho- nous," but there is usually no need to use this term. The autochthonous activity from which a dis- placement activity is derived, is called its "ex- ample." Before I discuss the causal study of displacement activities, a review of recorded instances must be given. In this review no attempt at completeness will be made; in fact I deliberately confine myself to such acts as have been observed repeatedly. For a fuller enumeration of records I must refer to Armstrong (1950). Some instances of displacement activities The aim of this section is to demonstrate the general occurrence and the variety of types of displacement activities, particularly for the bene- fit of those readers who are not acquainted with the phenomenon. I will arrange the instances according to the pattern to which they originally belong, irrespective of the circumstances that give rise to them. Also, I will describe "ritualized" as well as "pure" displacement activities, leaving the principle of ritualization to be discussed in a, later section. Though this is rather an inelegant</page><page sequence="7">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 7 way of introducing them, I prefer this presentation because it is the way in which nature itself pre- sents them to the observer. Foraging movements When a lapwing is disturbed at the nest, it will not only call the alarm and attack the intruder, but now and then it will alight, run "nervously" about, and peck at the ground. Usually this peck- ing is incomplete, only the curiously stiff bending movement betraying its nature. When the disturb- ance is prolonged it may develop into complete feeding, and I have seen a lapwing in this situa- tion actually catch a worm and eat it. A grey heron male, upon its return to the breeding colony in spring, selects a suitable nesting place in a tree. Here it begins to utter its "love call," which is true song, expressing sexual motivation and exerting an attractive influence on females. This love call is alternated with "snap- ping" (Fig. 1). "This is a very curious movement. The neck is stretched and the head is lowered to the level of the feet or even lower, when the bird bends its legs. When the head is at its lowest, the bird opens its bill and then shuts it with a loud clash. The feathers of the crest and neck are erected during this ceremony" (Verwey, 1930: 23-24). Verwey believes that "the fish- seizing movement has been put into the service of the love-life" (p. 25). This snapping is only done by the male, and only when it is under the influence of a strong sexual motivation. Snow bunting males in spring alternate fighting and threat with pecking at the snow-covered ground during boundary clashes. The same peck- ing movements are shown by the male when the female refuses copulation. This, in the early phase of mated life, leads to a "sexual flight" (Howard, 1929). Pecking movements appear before or after a sexual flight. They are just as incomplete as those shown during fighting. In the courtship they may alternate with sexual display, in which the male shows off its beautiful black-and-white dorsal plumage (Tinbergen, 1939a). According to Pickwell (1931), the prairie horned lark shows food-pecking during boundary disputes. Pickwell describes this behavior in the following words: "Now and then they will ap- proach each other in this attitude and peck away at the ground furiously, like two cock roosters in an intermission of battle" (p. 56). The similar behavior of domestic cocks, referred to here, is of course well known; it is also mentioned by Lorenz (1935). Pickwell's characterization "furi- ously" refers to a phenomenon which I shall discuss further below. Both the great tit and the blue tit show dis- placement eating during territory clashes. They will peck energetically at the twigs on which they happen to be sitting, or they will even select buds and tear them apart (Tinbergen, 1937; Hinde, 1952). Avocets show a variety of displacement ac- tivities during fights. According to Makkink (1936): "Sometimes the bowing before fighting [bowing is displacement nest-building, N.T.] is interrupted by a furious throwing of straws- especially in encounters on the land, but even in the water-and by water-pecking and shaking of the head or also by a fierce food-mowing-prin- cipally when in the water" (p. 18). While in some of the species mentioned previously the incomplete- ness of the movement often renders it difficult FIG. 1. MALE GREY HERON "SNAPPING" After Holstein, 1927. to be certain that we have to do with feeding movements, the specialized "food-mowing" of the avocet is easily recognized as such even if it is incomplete. Both displacement eating and displacement drinking have been observed numerous times in a male turkey by H. Raber (1948, p. 253): "When both the fighting and the fleeing drive were acti- vated it pecked imaginary food from the ground or showed a tendency to drink. In this case it sometimes went to the drinking cup and dipped the bill into the water, without actually drinking however." Displacement drinking has also been observed by Armstrong (1950, p. 369) in a female eider duck, which was disturbed at the nest. In animals other than birds there seems to be little evidence of displacement feeding, though occasional observations have convinced me that it is not uncommon in ruminants during aggres- sive encounters (Tinbergen, 1940). The threat posture of three-spined sticklebacks, originally interpreted by me (ibid.) as displacement-feeding</page><page sequence="8">8 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY later proved to be displacement sand-digging, a nest-building activity (see Tinbergen and Van Iersel, 1947). The wrong interpretation was due to the fact that for years we failed to see the high-intensity forms of this movement. These, as a matter of fact, appear only under abnormally crowded conditions, and until we had provoked these, we merely observed a vertical posture accompanied by an energetic budding into the ground. Somehow it did not occur to us that this might be displacement sand-digging. The more intensive movement, however, does not leave any doubt as to its origin, because sand is then actually taken up and carried away. Movements of care of the body surface ("comfort- movements," McDougall) The various movements belonging to this system (preening, shaking the plumage, wiping the bill, fir FIG. 2. PREENING AS PART OF THE PRECOITION DIsPLAY IN THE EUROPEAN AvoCET After Makkink, 1936. bathing) are also frequently used as displacement movements in a variety of situations. Fighting starlings may stop now and then and preen their wings in a "nervous" fashion. Many if not all species of cranes do the same (Lorenz, 1935). In many ducks displacement preening is a regular constituent of courtship by the drakes (Lorenz, 1941); the sheldrake always preens its wings just before coition (Makkink, 1931). Fighting snow bunting males alternate displacement-feeding with preening under the wing or in the scapulars (Tinbergen, 1939a). According to Makkink (1936, p. 13) the precoition behavior of the avocet con- sists of long bouts of preening: "The plumage preening by both members of a pair, connected with and interrupted by the dipping of the bill into the water, always precedes copulation" (Fig. 2). In pigeons displacement preening has a similar function. Many species preen the wings preceding coition, as described at length by Craig (1909), Whitman (1919), and Carpenter (1933). Kortlandt (1940b) reports that cormorants, when alarmed by human visitors, ruffle and shake the plumage when the danger is over. Various birds have been observed to displace- ment bathe. If, in a pair of shelduck, the copulation breaks off halfway, both partners may begin to bathe (Makkink, 1931). Armstrong (1950) reports displacement bathing in black-headed gulls dis- turbed at the nest. In the same situation that induces displacement-shaking in cormorants. Kort- landt observed displacement-bathing as well. In various birds of paradise bill-wiping is a regular constituent of the males' courtship (Arm- strong, 1950; Tinbergen, 1940). Scratching the fur has been observed in various primates when they are in some way frustrated (Portielje, 1939, in the orang utan; Tinbergen, 1940, in the chimpanzee). In man, various move- ments belonging to the same group of activities may be observed under conditions of stress: scratching behind the ear, biting the nails, in women various kinds of arranging the hair, etc. Nest-building movements Geese and swans of various species are known to dip their heads and necks into the water before coition (Heinroth, 1911). This has been inter- preted in various ways. Makkink, for instance, has suggested that in the sheldrake it might be a bathing movement (1931). Lorenz discovered that the birds occasionally bring up vegetable material from the bottom, which they sometimes deposit at their side with a sideways head move- ment. This shows that we have to do with nest- building movements. In boundary clashes herring gulls may take up nest-material, and throw it away with similar lateral head-movements. Sometimes they select strongly rooted plants that offer resistance and pull at them (Fig. 3). This grass-pulling, as well as another activity derived from the nest-building pattern ("choking"), will be discussed more fully in the analytical section. Nest relief in herring gulls often brings about displacement activities in the relieving bird, es- pecially when the partner is not willing to leave. The relieving bird may then bring nest-material; it may also "choke." The relieved bird may bring some nest-material as well; it may even collect it rather far from the nest and bring a load to the nest more than once.</page><page sequence="9">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 9 Kirkman (1937, pp. 78-79) gives an interesting description of similar behavior in the black- headed gull. He reports that much of the building activity seen after incubation has started is not autochthonous building but displacement build- ing. "A considerable number, if not most, of the additions are made owing to causes quite unrelated to the building of the nest, they are due to a substitute reaction, by which is here meant a reaction substituted for one that is prevented from taking place." "The occasion is the return of a bird to its nest. It is feeling broody and is eager to sit on the eggs, but its mate is in occupa- tion and refuses to budge. It tries to get the mate off by wedging itself under its breast, by pushing its foot against the immovable flank, by calling notes, by sitting on the back of the sitter. It is all no use; there is complete obstruction. "When this happens it is predictable that the frustrated bird, unable to satisfy its brooding gull, makes nest-building movements. Kirkman's report differs however from that on the herring gull in that he mentions a call "summoning chicks or the hen to food." As I will discuss later, I am inclined to believe that Kirkman here fails to distinguish between "choking" and feeding chicks or the hen; I rather think that he observe.d the equivalent of "choking." Nest-building behavior as a component of nest- relief is found in many related species, such as terns and waders. Both the relieving partner, walking towards the nest, and the relieved partner may pick up straws, pebbles, or shells, and throw them sideways. This movement is seen in a more complete form during actual nest-building in some species. When nests are in grass it serves to line them with the surrounding grass-shoots. Species nesting on the sea-shore usually pick up pebbles, shells, rabbit droppings and other odd objects that happen to lie around, and when, FIG. 3. "GRAsS-PULLING" IN THE HERRING GULL DURING A FIGHT After Tinbergen, 1951. urge, will find relief by substituting for incubation some reaction associated with the situation, usually gathering nest material. The following are two instances, and they could be multiplied." One of these instances may be quoted: "A re- turning bird, on being refused the eggs, went in search of nest material; it returned, dropped a weed on the margin of the nest, then tried to push the sitting bird out with its foot. This failing, it stood, beak downwards, uttering the crooning call note used to summon chicks or the hen to the food. As this also failed, the bird again went collecting; it returned without anything, again tried the effect of the call note, and again de- parted. It came and went twice more. The second time it appeared with a single short stalk pro- jecting from the corner of its mouth, with a comic resemblance to a toothpick. It found the nest vacated, whereupon it dropped the stalk into it and settled down." If the urge to brood is not quickly satisfied, therefore, the black-headed gull, like the herring as is often the case, it is mainly the relieved bird which picks them up and throws them back- wards, they gradually gather round the nest. As we will see later, it seems that in some species, for instance, the oystercatcher, this movement is always a displacement activity. The autochtho- nous "example," which is found in many waders, seems to have been lost in this species. In the mute swan, fighting may be interrupted by nest-building movements, viz., the picking-up of straws (Portielje, 1936). As I said before, the vertical threat-posture of male three-spined sticklebacks (Fig. 4) which I interpreted as dis- placement eating in my first paper (1940), could later be proven to be incomplete sand digging, the first stage of nest building (Tinbergen and Van Iersel, 1947). Sexual movements Even sexual movements may occur in situations that presumably do not affect the sexual drive itself. Palmgren (1934) describes how caged willow</page><page sequence="10">10 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY warblers, when showing the inhibited migratory movements called "migratory restlessness," in- tersperse them with courtship behavior. When cor- morants are fighting in defence of the nest (the center of their territory) they show, alternating with aggressive behavior, various sexual activities, such as wing-flapping and "gargling," both move- ments used in precoition behavior. In several birds coition has been observed to occur in situations where there is reason to be- lieve that the sexual drive cannot be responsible. Makkink (1936, p. 14) reports of the avocet "that copulations often occurred after the birds had been flushed. Further it was striking that they also often took place as a continuation of a battle. So too after an excitement." It would be worth while to know what kind of excitement was in- FIG. 4. DISPLACEMENT SAND-DIGGING IN THIE THREE- SPINED STICKLEBACK After Tinbergen and Van Iersel, 1947. volved, for this is of course decisive for proving the displacement character of the copulations; however, the two situations specified suggest that fighting, flight, or both, were involved rather than the sexual drive. Armstrong (1950) cites other similar observations. Lastly, song is often uttered in circumstances which have nothing to do with reproduction. For instance, a skylark may burst into violent song after just having escaped from a duck hawk or a hobby, and numerous other instances of dis- placement song are known. Food-begging movements In the herring gull the introduction to coition consists of mutual "head-tossing" (Fig. 5). Both birds withdraw their heads, and rhythmically point the bill upwards with a short jerky move- ment. This behavior is identical with that by which full-grown young beg their parents for food. Sometimes the head-tossing is done by the female alone; in that case it usually leads to the male's feeding her. Accurate descriptions are found in Goethe (1937) and in Tinbergen (1952). Incubation According to Kortlandt (1940b), cormorants often interrupt nest-battles by bouts of "false brooding." It is much less common, however, than sexual displacement activities are in the same situation. The false brooding of various waders, notably the oystercatcher, as a reaction to a predator near the nest, may be interpreted as displacement brooding. This however depends on the under- lying drives. Makkink (1942) thinks we have to do with an autochthonous continuation of brood- ing itself, which was interrupted when the bird FIG. 5. PRECOITION DISPLAY ("HEAD-ToSSING") IN THE HERRING GULL After Tinbergen, 1940. had to run from the nest. I suggest as another possibility that a combination of the attack- and the escape-drives is responsible, but I cannot prove this. Makkink reports (1936) that during exciting hostile encounters avocets may suddenly sit down. He does not interpret this movement, but Kort- landt argues that it must be displacement brood- ing. Although in this false brooding several characteristic elements, such as ruffling the ventral feathers, scraping with the legs, and the waggling movements ordinarily shown by birds settling on the eggs, are absent, this in itself is not against the interpretation, since displacement activities often remain incomplete. Koehler, in a foot-note in my 1940-paper, describes this incomplete brooding on the part of a ringed plover which was disturbed at the nest. Sleep Even sleep may appear as a displacement ac- tivity. This was first discovered by Makkink</page><page sequence="11">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 11 (1936) in the avocet (Fig. 6). It has since been observed in various other waders, always in aggressive situations (oystercatcher (Fig. 7), Makkink, 1942; Edwards, Hosking, and Stuart Smith, 1948; turnstone, Bergman, 1946; common sandpiper, Poulsen, 1950). I saw it a few times in fighting snow bunting males (Tinbergen, 1939a). Analysis The underlying drives The above review leads to a hypothesis about the causes of displacement activities. At first glance, a certain deliberation on the animal's part might seem to play a role, and this naturally tempts one to give an anthropo- morphic, psychological explanation. For instance, when an aggressive stickleback or an aggressive gull makes incipient nest-building movements, one might suppose that they are trying to show j FIG. 6. DISPLACEMENT SLEEP IN THE EUROPEAN AVOCET DURING A FIGHT After Makkink, 1936. to the other of their species that this is the spot where they intend to build a nest. I consider this anthropomorphic interpretation unsatisfactory, not only because by its very nature it can neither be proved nor disproved, but also because it can only be applied to these special cases and leaves all the other cases unexplained. If herring gulls and sticklebacks show nest-building movements in order to advertise their nest-building intentions, then why does a starling in the same situation preen its feathers, a skylark peck at the ground, or an avocet go to sleep? Certainly not in order to show that this is where they want to preen, to eat, to sleep? Another type of explanation is offered by Mak- kink (1936, p. 27). He supposes that a fighting bird is sometimes overcome by disgust. "When this disgust is not strong enough to make the bird attack, fly off or go away, it brings about another manner to withdraw from the surrounding birds." Again, apart from the problem whether this psychological interpretation satisfies us as an ethological explanation as well, it is difficult to conceive that this withdrawal from an un- pleasant situation could be effected by eating, nest-building, and preening just as well as by sleep. Thus it seems justifiable to try and find another explanation. I believe I can give a plausible, if somewhat tentative explanation. In the main, this is the theory I put forward in 1940; on the basis of new facts, I have changed my views on some minor aspects, and also extended the theory somewhat. First, it is clear that all the instances mentioned concern innate behavior patterns of a type that is usually dependent, at least in part, on internal impulses. When performed in non-irrelevant situa- tions, these activities use up at least part of the specific action potential; or, in other words, they give some relief to the underlying drive, they lower FIG. 7. DISPLACEMENT SLEEP IN THE OYSTERCATCHER Modified after Edwards, Hosking, and Stuart Smith, 1948. the motivation. This is inferred mainly from the fact that shortly after performing an activity the animal is, for some time, less ready to show the same activity again, even under exactly the same conditions as before. Are there indications that displacement activities do the same, that they are also an outlet of strong impulses? There are, mainly, two types of situations in which displacement activities occur: a hostile situation, and a purely sexual situation. Further, irrelevant acts may occur in birds that are incubat- ing or leading the young when they are disturbed by predators. I will consider these situations separately. The hostile situation. One circumstance which I have not emphasized thus far seems to give the key to the solution of the problem: displacement activities are most frequent during boundary disputes. In order to make clear what bearing this has on our problem, it must be recalled that, in a</page><page sequence="12">12 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY territory-owning male, a strange male may release two entirely different reactions, depending on where he meets the stranger. An intruder into the territory releases attack, but the very same individual met outside the territory is ignored or even, if on its own ground, avoided-i.e., it re- leases escape. Usually, there is no sharp boundary, but aggressiveness decreases and the avoidance tendency increases with increasing distance from the territory's center. When two males meet each other somewhere between the two territories, each is influenced by the other in two ways. First, because the other is so near the territory, the owner is roused to attack. But the stranger re- leases avoidance as well, for it is not exactly in the -owner's territory, but just outside it, and in its own territory. Each male is in the same ambivalent state, which often finds expression in an ambivalent reaction: attack and retreat alternate quickly FIG. 8. T:M UPRIGHT THREAT PosTURE OF THE HERING GULL and repeatedly. This reciprocal "pendulum"- movement can often be observed in sticklebacks; I saw it also in male snow buntings; one "pendu- lum duel" lasted for nearly an hour without pause. Pickwell (1931) described the same of the prairie horned lark. These observations show that two drives, at- tack and escape, are activated at the same time. Neither can find an outlet in complete behavior, for they are incompatible, but the alternation of mere intention movements seems to be a sufficient outlet so long as the drives are not too strong. Incidentally, their occurrence facilitates the recog- nition of the nature of the drives. Essentially the same situation, only in a more intense form, leads to displacement activities. Our hypothesis there- fore is that the displacement activities are outlets through which the thwarted drives can express themselves in motion. In birds, experimental proof of this hypothesis is difficult to obtain. Three-spined sticklebacks, how- ever, offered a good opportunity for experimenta- tion. It is possible to release the hostile responses in territorial sticklebacks by offering a crude model, an elongated object of about stickleback size, with a blue eye and a red underside. When this is lowered into an occupied stickleback territory, the owner attacks it. Now if the model, instead of fleeing-as any real stickleback would do-fights back, that is to say, if the experimenter hits the owner with the model as hard as he can, the territory-holding male will, after a short period of intensified attack, ultimately flee. It turns dark on the back, and slips into cover, where it remains motionless, keeping an eye on the terrifying stran- ger. This of course is a rather unnatural situation, for in nature intruding males will rarely fight and beat an already settled opponent. (Occasionally however, this happens, at least in birds, as every bird watcher knows.) If now the model is quietly held in the territory, the owner's mood will gradually change. The attack-releasing stimuli are being sent out by the model as before. In the meantime, the after-effect of the flight-inducing beating wanes. That this is so can be seen by the fact that, after some minutes, the owner begins to attack again. Now just before the actual attack comes, the male adopts the vertical threat posture, which, as we saw, is displacement sand- digging. This means, that a displacement activity indeed appears when the fighting drive and the escape drive are in equilibrium. This experiment therefore confirms the hypoth- esis based on an analysis of the situation and of the intention movements shown in a low-intensity combat. Although experimental evidence has not yet been produced in birds, the circumstantial evi- dence we have suggests that the same explanation holds here too. I have already mentioned the ambivalent "pendulum flights" in the prairie horned lark and in the snow bunting. I have more detailed data on the herring gull. Although colony birds, herring gull males defend territories as fiercely as any other territorial species. In case of intrusion, a territory-holding male chases the stranger. When on strange territory itself, it flees directly the owner attacks. Boundary clashes between neighboring males, however, release quite different types of behavior. A male walking towards an intruder assumes the "upright threat posture" (Fig. 8). The neck is stretched upward and forward. The head is pointing down. Some-</page><page sequence="13">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 13 times the wings are lifted. This can all be recog- nized as incipient attack. In a real fight, a herring gull attempts to get on top of its opponent and peck down at it; also it delivers powerful blows with the wing. The stretching of the neck, the position of the bill, and the raising of the wings are the very beginnings of these fight movements. The upright threat-posture therefore shows that the gull is in fighting mood. While the bird approaches its opponent-who, on its territory itself, usually adopts the same attitude-a slight but definite change in its posture is evident. The neck, which was stretched obliquely forward at first, is withdrawn in a more vertical posture. When the two birds are very close together, one of them may even bend the neck still further back, through the vertical. The bill is then no longer pointing down but is about hori- zontal. Such a bird is the more liable of the two to withdraw. This withdrawal of the neck is, I think, incipient retreat, or defence rather than attack. A bird which gets the worst in a struggle withdraws, if facing its enemy at all, in the same position. The upright threat-posture therefore seems to be an intention movement of attack, mixed with the intention movement of defence. This points to the conclusion again that two antagonistic drives are active, of which only the intention movements can appear simultaneously. The close parallel with the "pendulum duels" of sticklebacks, snow buntings and horned larks is clear. The only difference is that the herring gull combines the elements simultaneously into one movement instead of showing the two elements in quick alternation. A bout of mutual threatening between two herring gulls may either die down (as it does only too frequently, much to the observer's annoyance), or it may develop into a genuine fight. If it does, the behavior passes into one of two types of more intense threat. One type is "grass pulling." The gull pecks at the ground, takes some nest material in the bill, and tears it out. Sometimes it will keep it in the bill for some time, but usually it drops it at once, sometimes with the well-known sideways movement of the head. In spite of some peculiari- ties which distinguish this movement from the real movements of collecting nest-material- differences to which I will presently return-there is, I think, no doubt that this threat display is derived from nest-building movements. Since both the environmental situation ("boundary clash") and the movements exhibited by the birds show that they are being urged, not by a nest-building drive but by a combination of aggressiveness and of a tendency to flee or to withdraw, this grass pulling is clearly a displacement activity. The next type of threat behavior in the herring gull is a rather puzzling one. It is shown in about the same circumstances as grass pulling but it takes place when the partners of a pair defend the territory together. They bend their legs, squatting down in a half-hearted way, and, lowering the tongue bone, which gives them a very curious facial expression, make rhythmic pecking movements at the ground, without actually touching it, however (Fig. 9). A low, rhythmical sound is produced simultaneously. Noble and Wurm (1943), who described the same movement in the American laughing gull, called it "choking." Choking is not only shown in an aggressive situation, but also when there is no sign of ag- / FIG. 9. "CHOKiNG" OF THE HERRING GULL After Tinbergen, 1940. gressiveness. When a pair is selecting a nest site in the territory, or when they are actually build- ing, or when, in the beginning of the incubation period, they meet at the nest, exactly the same ceremony occurs. One bird may actually sit in the nest while the other squats somewhere at its side. The accompanying movements in the non- aggressive situation belong to the nest-building system: for instance, leg-scraping is often shown. Leg-scraping can also, though rarely, be observed during the aggressive choking. Since choking in non-aggressive situations is always connected with nest-building, I consider it part of the nest- building pattern, although its exact function in that context is obscure. I rather think that even in the nest-building pattern choking is a derived and probably complex movement, but that is irrelevant here; for our present purpose it is sufficient to state that aggressive choking is a displacement activity "borrowed" from the nest- building pattern; where it came from is a subse- quent problem.</page><page sequence="14">14 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY There is, however, some disagreement about the interpretation of non-aggressive choking. Portielje (1928), who observed it in the herring gull, and Kirkman (1937), who found it in the black-headed gull, both hold that it is part of the parental pattern and is derived from feeding the young. As I have argued in more detail in my forthcoming book on the herring gull, I cannot agree with them. In both species, the feeding behavior is quite different from choking. Also, evidence of related species, such as the common gull, the Iceland gull, and the laughing gull (Noble and Wurm, 1943) lead me to believe that here too choking has to do with nest-building rather than with feeding the young. My conclusion therefore is that aggressive choking is a displacement activity derived from nest-building. What function choking has in the nest-building pattern is not quite clear, because it does not materially add to the building of the nest. As I said, it may be a derived movement itself. In that case the aggressive choking would be the displacement of an already secondary move- ment. A similar situation is reported by Kortlandt of the cormorant. The hostile behavior of the herring gull there- fore contains at least five different types of move- ment. In extreme cases we may see eithpr escape, or forthright attack. In case of simultaneous and balanced activation of the drive to attack and the drive to escape we see either a combination of the intention movements of the two drives, or, in case of a higher degree of activation, one or another type of displacement nest-building. The displacement activities in the aggressive behavior of the herring gulls therefore can be explained in the same way as displacement sand- digging in the three-spined stickleback; in both cases we have strong evidence of a conflict between two drives, the executive patterns of which are antagonistic and incompatible. The result is that the drives activated by the situation (environ- mental and internal) cannot find an outlet in autochthonous consummatory acts and have to find an outlet through other, "irrelevant" pat- terns. I have little doubt that the occurrence of dis- placement activities in hostile situations in other species is to be explained in a similar, though not necessarily identical, way. In all cases there is reason to suppose that there is a surplus of drive, due to the simultaneous activation of incompatible instincts. Recently, Hinde (1952) has analyzed the hostile behavior of Great Tits and arrived at similar conclusions. J"Sudden cessation of external stimulation. Kortlandt (1940 a, b) has observed that aggressive behavior in the cormorant may suddenly change into displacement behavior, derived from the sexual patterns. This happens especially when the op- ponent flees suddenly. His explanation is that the fighting drive has been so intensely aroused that a sudden escape of the opponent leaves the ani- mal with an activated fighting drive but minus the external object at which the fighting can be aimed. In other words, the actual fighting, the consummatory activity which alone can use up the fighting impulses, cannot be performed because necessary external stimuli are absent, and this leaves the animal with a residuum of fighting drive. The displacement activities serve as an outlet of this residuum of drive. I think this explanation has to be applied to a number of cases. When a drive is strongly acti- vated, it cannot die down immediately, but there is a period of "after discharge." During this period there is a tendency to movement, strong at first, and weakening gradually. If the movements be- longing to this drive are relatively independent of external releasing stimuli, that is, if they can easily go off "in vacuo," we may see some autoch- thonous activity. But if, as is the case in many behavior patterns, external stimuli are essential for the release of consummatory activity, the dis- appearance or, in general, the absence of the stimu- lating object means a thwarting of the drive. It cannot find an outlet through autochthonous ac- tivity, and displacement activities result. This happens not only with the fighting drive, in situa- tions as described above, but also with other drives. When an incubating bird is relieved at the nest by its partner, its brooding drive, although rela- tively low after a spell of incubating, is still high enough to give rise to displacement activities when the approach of the partner stimulates it to leave the nest, and thus suddenly takes away the nest and eggs, which provide the stimuli necessary for actual brooding. In Laro-Limicolae the displace- ment activity most commonly seen under such circumstances is the well-known picking-up of straws, shells, and other material and the side- ways movements of the head by which they are thrown away. The fact that this is done not only by the relieved bird but also by the relieving bird</page><page sequence="15">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 15 before settling on the eggs, requires another ex- planation. I believe that the relieving bird, re- turning under the influence of its increased incu- bation drive, becomes progressively more strongly stimulated as it approaches the nest. Until it can satisfy this drive by actually sitting on the eggs it vents it through displacement activities. There are indications that the situation is really somewhat more complicated (for instance, the to-be-relieved bird often begins to show displacement behavior before the partner has taken possession of the eggs), but in the main I think we have to do with an excess of brooding drive, and not with any conflict. In a similar way we must, I think, explain post- coitional behavior. After coition, the drive dies down gradually and not abruptly, and this period of "after discharge" gives rise to displacement activities. The post-coition behavior is often diffi- cult to judge, because it consists so often of preen- ing or bathing movements, which both could be considered autochthonous responses to the dis- ordered state of the plumage. But in the red- necked phalarope, where the female takes the initiative in courtship and coition, she often at- tacks the male immediately after coition. Also, she goes on land and indulges in a bout of nest- building (Tinbergen, 1935). Here again we have to do with an excess of one drive only, and not with a conflict between drives. This excess exists temporarily when a drive is activated but the stimuli necessary for the release of its consummatory acts are absent. Pre-coition display. As we have seen in the de- scriptive section, the courtship displays and pre- coition displays of many species contain displace- ment activities. We have to examine the question whether in these cases there is also evidence of a surplus of drive, and if so, whether this surplus is due to a conflict between two drives, or to an excess of one drive only, or to something else. I think there can be no doubt that the pre- coition display is indicative of a state of intense activation of the sexual drive. Further, the display ends abruptly as soon as the animal performs the consummatory act of the sexual drive. The male avocet, for instance, preens until it mounts the female; the male herring gull goes on tossing its head until it attempts copulation. The display appears only as long as the sexual drive does not express itself in coition. Again, therefore, we have to do with an activated drive which gives rise to displacement activities as long as no autochthonous outlet is used. This conclusion remains rather tentative, however, unless we can find out why the drive does not give rise to autochthonous activity. In my 1940 paper I discussed two possibilities. (1) In many cases the actual mounting of the male has to be released by a special attitude of the female, indicating her readiness to mate. Thus in the avocet, the male's pre-coition preening goes on until the female adopts the flat, horizontal coition-attitude. In this, and similar, cases the male seems to be dependent on a stimulus from the female to such a degree, that without this stimulus he is unable to copulate. Strong activation of the sexual drive and absence of the necessary external stimulus seem in such cases to be the causes of an excess, and the displacement activities during pre-coition behavior can be considered to be due to this excess of sexual drive. Together with J. Van Iersel, I have analyzed the pre-coition behavior of the male three-spined stickleback, which is a chain of five activities. Two of these are displacement activities, and they appear in situations when the sexual drive is strongly activated but the next reaction of the female (which in both cases has been proved to be indispensable for the cofntinuation of the male's behavior) is not yet forthcoming. The evidence in this case therefore supports the view that the excess is due to the activation of one drive. (2) Various authors (Verwey, 1930; Kortlandt, 1940b; and others) have argued that copulation in birds brings about a situation which they nor- mally avoid, viz., bodily contact with another individual. It is quite possible therefore that the pre-coition situation evokes in each individual a tendency to keep away from the partner as well as a tendency to draw together. In that case, the cause of the excess of the sexual drive would again be conflict. Although since 1940 our knowledge of displace- ment behavior has increased, it is still not possible to decide which of the two hypotheses is the correct one. I am rather inclined to think that they are both true, that in many cases the main cause of the excess is lack of required external stimulation by the partner, but that conflict may be partially responsible as well. I even think that the tendency to withdraw may not be the only nor the main drive in conflict with the sexual drive, but that there may be a tendency to attack the female as well. Without entering into a detailed discussion</page><page sequence="16">16 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of the evidence pointing to this, I may recall the fact that so many male birds (and other animals) show, as the first reaction to an intruding in- dividual, the same response to females as they do to males, and that this first reaction is often a hostile one. It is the function of the behavior of the female following such an encounter to sup- press the male's aggressiveness and to elicit its sexual responses. The herring gull's pre-coition behavior gives some support to the view that something more than simple lack of stimuli is involved. As described above, both male and female toss their heads before coition, and this head tossing must be considered to be displacement-begging. The fe- male, unlike other species, has no special posture indicating readiness, but continues to toss her head even after the male has mounted, only discontinuing it during actual contact of the clo- acas. The male therefore mounts without having been stimulated to do so by a particular gesture. This means that his head-tossing cannot be due to the absence of coition-releasing stimuli, and that there must be another cause of the thwarting of the sexual drive. Whether this has to do with a conflict with the fighting drive seems uncertain. Concluding, it seems probable that in pre-coition behavior again the occurrence of displacement activities is due to an excess of drive. The excess may be due to conflict, as in a hostile situation, but this is not necessarily so; in fact, the main cause of the surplus is the arousing of the sexual instinct while indispensable external stimuli are absent. Since misunderstandings have arisen in this respect, it is necessary to emphasize that ex- cess of drive is not always due to conflict. Special mention must now be made of displace- ment activities during those phases of courtship not immediately leading to coition. Heinroth has already said that "courtship ("Balz") and coition ("Begattung") often have nothing to do with each other." This is true in so far that not all courtship leads immediately to coition; much courtship leads to pair formation, and coition is often preceded by a type of behavior quite different from this early courtship. This depends on whether there is a period of "betrothal" or not, and this differs from species to species. The male mallard provides an instance of this duality of courtship and pre-coition behavior. The latter consists of the vertical down-and-up movements of the head, which is, according to Lorenz (1941) origi- nally an intention movement of mounting. Court- ship, which is intensive in autumn and winter, is quite different. One component of it is displacement preening. The question arises whether during this type of courtship there is a similar excess of drive, as in pre-coition behavior, and, if so, what is the nature of the activated drive, and why there should be an excess. Although I believe that we again have to do with an unsatisfied sexual drive, I cannot present conclusive support for it, and the need of further careful study must be emphasized. The situation "predator near brood." Displacement activities have been recorded in numerous cases where birds were flushed from the nest or the young by man or other predators. In some birds the nature of the behavior shown in this situation is very obvious, as in the lapwing, which shows incomplete, sometimes even complete, feeding movements. In many birds the displacement behavior seems to be ritualized as an adaptation to a diversionary function, and may be difficult to recognize. Yet both Armstrong (1949) and Williamson (1950) show that many diversionary patterns contain displacement activities. There is still uncertainty about the nature of the drives involved in this situation. It seems to me plausible that we have to do with a conflict of at least two drives. Since the bird actually keeps away from the predator, the fleeing drive is no doubt involved, which is entirely consistent with behavior outside the breeding season. I think further that we need not doubt that a drive to attack the predator is also activated. So many birds actually attack predators at the nest that when they fail to attack, one cannot help believing that this is merely because the drive to attack is just too low to overcome the fleeing drive. This is supported by the fact that the more formidable predators are less liable to be attacked than smaller predators. It seems probable therefore that there is a con- flict between these two incompatible tendencies, the tendency to keep away from the predator and the tendency to attack it, a part of the system of reproductive drives. However, we know that a third drive is always active in this situation, the parental drive, or rather that part of it leading to incubate or guard the brood. The part played by this drive is uncertain. Obviously, the problem is complicated, and although much has already been written on it,</page><page sequence="17">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 17 the basic question of the nature of the underlying drives is still unsolved. Sleep as an outlet. If my thesis is correct, and dis- placement activities are an outlet of an excess of drive, it is at first glance incomprehensible that sleep should appear as a displacement activity, for sleep is commonly regarded as lack of activity ra- ther than activity. Not so long ago no physiologist believed that sleep was due to nervous activity; on the contrary, sleep was proved to coincide with suppression of certain aspects of nervous activity, such as sensitivity to external stimuli. On the other hand, several psychologists have regarded sleep as an instinctive activity (e.g., McDougall). The recent development of this problem is highly interesting; it has shown the psychologists to be right, and instead of a puzzle sleep has become an impressive test-case of our theory of displace- ment activities. From the point of view of ethology, sleep is similar to consummatory acts in that it is preceded by a special type of appetitive behavior. Many animals resort to a special sleeping place or roost, many birds even carry out extensive migrations every evening. The orang utan builds a sleeping platform every day (Portielje, 1939). Now it is of considerable interest that Hess (1944) has proved, by his well-known method of direct electrical stimulation of the brain of the cat, that sleep can be provoked instantaneously if a certain area of the hypothalamus is stimulated. Depending on the exact locus of stimulation Hess could produce sleep, aggressive behavior, eating, or defecation. This shows first that sleep, with the accompanying suppression of nervous activity, depends on activity of a strictly localized part of the brain, and further that in this respect it behaves exactly like movements generally recog- nized to be dependent on nervous activity. These facts show that there is no inconsistency in the occurrence of sleep as a displacement activity. They demonstrate also how a study of displace- ment activities may help towards a better under- standing of instinct in general. The types of movement used as outlets Innate or learnt? So far as we know at present, displacement activities are always innate motor patterns, at least in fish, birds, and most mam- mals. Man forms an exception, for he may use acquired patterns such as lighting a cigarette, or fumbling a bunch of keys, etc. This does not mean that man does not use innate patterns at all. The frequency of all types of scratching, rubbing the chin, etc., in men, and of adjusting the hair in women, shows that there is a strong tendency to find an outlet through movements originally serving care of the body surface, the "comfort" movements. Several of these movements are, I think, innate. Another innate pattern used is yawning, and even sleep. The use of acquired patterns, however, occurs widely in man, and thus far no parallel has been found in animals, although it must be admitted that the other primates have not been adequately studied from this point of view. I happen to have observed that chimpanzees under certain conditions of frustration of feeding are subject to violent outbursts of scratching. In most animals studied there is a certain regu- larity in the occurrence of displacement activities. A hostile situation releases displacement digging (nest-building) in a male stickleback, but dis- placement preening in a starling, and displacement sleep in an oystercatcher. A thwarted sexual drive will never release displacement digging in a male stickleback, but instead leads to displace- ment fanning (a parental activity, serving ventila- tion of the eggs if autochthonously employed). This shows that the thwarted drive is somehow limited in its outlet. The outlet differs from one drive to another, and from one species to another. As we will presently see, this connection between thwarted drive and type of outlet is not always entirely rigid. First, in mammals the outlet is not found through one particular consummatory act but through a higher system, through a variable pattern of related activities. This was pointed out by Schenkel in his admirable study of the social behavior of wolves (1947). To some extent this is also true of birds and fish. A stickleback may oc- casionally pick up nest material in hostile situa- tions of high intensity. Nevertheless, this is rare; and it should also be noted that sand-digging and picking up nest-material both belong to the nest-building pattern. I will return to this problem later. Second, some species show a variety of displacement activities even in one situation. Thus the avocet picks up nest material, or shakes the head, or makes feeding movements in inter- missions of fights; movements, therefore, that belong to three different instincts (Makkink, 1936). All these cases show that in some species a particular situation may provoke more than one</page><page sequence="18">18 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY type of displacement activity, but even in part of these cases the various displacement activities belong to the same major pattern. We may state therefore that there is often a definite connection between the thwarted drives and the type of displacement activity used as an outlet. This connection differs from one species to another. I cannot explain these differences; yet I think there are some facts which suggest in what direc- tions we may have to look for an answer. Outlet through activated instincts? It is striking that displacement activities are often innate movements which are frequently used in everyday life: eating, preening, etc. Further, when man uses an acquired motor pattern as an outlet, it is al- ways a pattern which he is using quite frequently for its own sake. This seems to indicate that an animal is apt to use as outlets those patterns which for some reason offer least resistance. As we shall see further on, the intensity of the thwarted drive which causes the displacement ac- tivity always differs from the intensity of the displacement activity itself. Even when an ani- mal is strongly motivated, the displacement activity which occurs when the drive is thwarted is incomplete and of low intensity. This indicates that displacement meets with some kind of inner resistance, causing "loss of impulses." This leads us to expect that either external factors or the state of activation of an instinct could influence the likelihood of its patterns being used as outlets by another instinct. The only reliable evidence on the first problem is brought forward by Kortlandt (1940) for the cormorant, and it seems to speak against such an influence. Fighting cormorants show displacement wing-flapping and "gargling" (both derived from the sexual pattern) and "nest-quivering" (derived from the nest-building pattern). Now although these activities, when autochthonously aroused, show a marked seasonal fluctuation, being fre- quent in spring but almost absent in winter, their use as an outlet during fighting remains the same throughout the year. This can be understood on the basis of recent research on the influence of hormones on behavior. In domestic fowl (and in other birds) incubation and care of the young are dependent on the presence of prolactin, a pituitary hormone. Domestic cocks, which nor- mally neither incubate nor take charge of the chicks, will respond to chicks and show all the maternal behavior when injected with prolactin. However, they do not show any interest in eggs. This and similar observations suggest that apart from the hormone there must be a definite mecha- nism in the nervous system reacting to the hor- mone stimulation. The mechanism of maternal care is obviously present in the cock, although owing to absence of prolactin it is never used; but the mechanism of incubation is absent, be- cause even prolactin stimulation (which promptly activates maternal behavior in non-broody hens) fails to bring about maternal behavior in the cock (Nalbandov and Card, 1945). This suggests that in the cormorant the seasonal fluctuation of the autochthonous reproductive drive is due to hormone fluctuation, but the nervous mechanisms are present and ready for action during the whole year. At least in this case the state of activation of the sexual instinct -the extent of which depends on the concentra- tion of sex hormone-does not determine the liability of sexual movements to be used as outlets of other instincts. It is, I think, important to see the restricted nature of this conclusion: it re- mains undecided whether activation by factors other than hormones may influence this liability. "Pure reactions" are not used. Another fact re- ported by Kortlandt indicates that the degree of spontaneity of an activity may determine its liability to be used as an outlet. Kortlandt draws attention to the fact that of the four patterns of the comfort instinct: bathing, preening, shaking, and wing-drying, the three first-named are often performed spontaneously, whereas wing-drying is an (almost) pure reaction. It is perhaps signif- icant that the first three patterns are used as displacement activities, but wing drying is not. It seems probable that the liability of a movement to be used as a displacement activity depends on the extent to which this movement, in its autoch- thonous form, is dependent on internal factors. This could be tested by correlating the degree of spontaneity of activities with their use as outlets. The degree of spontaneity could be assessed by various criteria, particularly the frequency of vacuum activities, and the exhaustibility. If such a correlation exists, it could explain why some activities are used more often than others. It could not explain, however, why the sexual and the fighting instinct use different outlets when thwarted. J The influence of the initial posture. Another possible factor has been suggested to me by Prof. G. P.</page><page sequence="19">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 19 Baerends. A study of the threat behavior of various fishes leads to the following, admittedly highly tentative, supposition. Many fish tend to bend forward and downward in a balanced hostile situation. In the three-spined stickleback this is the introduction to sand digging. The ten-spined stickleback and, to a lesser extent, the sea stickle- back do the same; yet they build their nests in plants well above the bottom and do not dig a pit for the nest at all. This forward bending is also found in other fish, such as various cichlids. It is possibly a posture which facilitates stopping or even witbdrawing. Now the occurrence of forward bending in the ten-spined stickleback could either be a remnant of displacement digging, originated at a time when all sticklebacks built nests at the bottom, or, the other way round, the forward bending could be primary and have developed into displacement digging in the only species which has the digging pattern. In view of the occurrence of forward bending in non-digging fish, the second supposi- tion does not seem improbable. It would then be possible that the three-spined stickleback "chose" displacement digging as an outlet because forward bending is also the natural preparation of sand digging. In other words, the posture in which the animal finds itself when a drive is thwarted might decide which activity will be used as an outlet. This hypothesis could be used as an explanation of several other displacement phenomena. The male three-spined stickleback, when strongly stimulated sexually by a female, but unable to mate because the female does not follow it to the nest and thus fails to provide the only stimulus capable of releasing sperm ejaculation, swims towards the nest, which is the normal introduc- tion to the sexual act. It does not enter it as long as the female does not enter and lay eggs, but it stops in front of the nest and remains there in a forward-bent attitude. If the female still does not react, the male's thwarted sexual drive finds an outlet through fanning and through "pushing" (a nest-building activity). It is striking that exactly these two movements require the same introductory position of standing in a down- bent attitude above the nest. ./'A similar explanation could be applied to the grass pulling of the herring gull. This develops from the upright threat-posture which, as we have seen, is an autochthonous movement, combining elements of preparation to attack and of with- drawal. The bill is pointed downward, ready to peck at the opponent. Instead, however, it pecks at nest material on the ground. Again, both autoch- thonous and allochthonous movements have the same preparatory posture. The curious displacement-begging of the female herring gull before coition and before conjugal feeding could perhaps be similarly explained. As in so many birds, the male's main reaction when in reproductive mood is aggressiveness. Mating can only take place if the female manages to sup- press the male's aggressiveness. She does this by adopting an attitude the opposite of the upright threat-posture: instead of standing upright, she bends forward; instead of stretching the neck, she withdraws it as far as possible; instead of pointing the bill down, she points it for%vard. This is the same posture adopted by the young when they have grown up so far that their gull-like shape (as distinct from the chick-shape) is apt to release aggressiveness instead of parental care in the parents. This posture, favored by selection as the best means to appease the male, is in the pre-coi- tion situation continued into head-tossing, which is the infantile begging movement. Although these few cases do not yet prove much, and although the principle, if true, would not suffice to explain all types of displacement activities, it seems to be worth testing. As with other problems, we need more facts, derived not from casual, isolated observations, but from long and detailed studies. The influence of external stimuli. The external situation at the moment when displacement activities occur may influence the type of dis- placement activity shown. A number of observa- tions prove that in certain situations a variety of different displacement activities may occur. Which of these will occur seems often to depend on the external situation; thus the presence of food may facilitate displacement feeding, nest material may tip the balance in favor of displace- ment-nest-building, etc. Fighting cormorants usually vent their excess of drive through wing flapping, gargling, and "nest quivering." If nest material or an ap- propriate substitute is absent, however, no nest building is observed, and the drive finds an outlet through wing flapping and gargling only (Kort- landt, 1940). Armstrong (1950, p. 369) writes: "When Eider Ducks, Somateria mollissii1a, are disturbed from the nest they perform various</page><page sequence="20">20 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY displacements, but do not normally displacement- drink, but in Iceland a bird which I alarmed found a stream in her way and displacement-drank repeatedly." It is possible that some of the other observations reported by Armstrong must be interpreted in the same way. In other cases, however, no such variability and no dependence on the external situation is found. Threatening male sticklebacks show always displacement sand-digging, irrespective of whether there is sand to be carried or not, threatening gulls may even "choke" while swimming (Port- ielje), and so on. It seems that variability and dependence on external stimuli are most evident in such displacement activities as have no signal- function (see below). The acquisition of a signal (releaser-) function, which is undoubtedly a secondary development and which leads to loss of the allochthonous character of the displacement activity, seems also to lead to a more rigid fixation of certain displacement activities to particular drives. This would mean that the situation of variable outlets is the more original state. It would follow that an insight into the problem of why one displacement activity would be more probable than another could be promoted best by concentrating on the nonritualized displace- ment activities, those without releaser function. Reciprocity not proved. Armstrong (1950), follow- ing Kortlandt, has claimed that there are indi- cations of a tendency of reciprocal linkages between drives in such a way that if drive a when thwarted finds an outlet through patterns of drive b, then drive b, when obstructed in its turn, tends to find its outlets through patterns of drive a. "Thus epigamic displays tend to "spark over" or become side-tracked into fighting, and vice versa." (Armstrong, 1950, p. 368). I cannot support this from my own experience. In the three-spined stickleback, while fighting "sparks over" to sand digging, this never happens the other way round. While the sexual drive finds an outlet through fanning, the parental drive, or fanning itself, if obstructed, does not lead to sexual dis- placement-activities. Although fighting in the herring gull "sparks over" to nest-building, the reverse is not true. Of course, in species such as the avocet and the cormorant, where a thwarted drive may find an outlet through more than one other pattern, the chances are (there being so few patterns) that the reverse may occasionally happen. My experience thus far does not show reciprocity to be more common than chance in this sense would make it. Displacement as regression? Nor is there any foundation for the belief that "displacements are often regressions" to behavior belonging to an earlier phase of the cycle, as Armstrong claims. This of course would be well-founded only if in reproductive behavior displacement-activities were borrowed from earlier phases more often than from later phases. So far as we know, one happens as of- ten as the other, and in addition the outlet may in- volve non-reproductive activities such as preening, sleep, etc. Thus fighting sticklebacks, fighting gulls, and courting sticklebacks all use displace- ment activities borrowed from later phases. Incu- bating gulls and waders, which show nest-building behavior when obstructed, do the reverse. The observation from Palmer quoted by Arm- strong, that "a Common Tern whose eggs have just been removed proceeds to make 'scrapes'," is open to more than one interpretation. If the nest was on sand, it might have been an autoch- thonous activity for the purpose of digging up eggs covered with sand. It is also possible, if the test was done early in the cycle, that the scraping was an autochthonous regression, the bird begin- ning a new cycle. Anyway, generalizations based on so narrow and uncertain a base should be critically tested with all the available evidence before publication. Differences between the displacement activity and its "example" In the preceding sections I have occasionally remarked upon the fact that a displacement activity usually differs from the autochthonous act from which it is derived, its "example." For instance, the displacement digging of a stickleback is often so unlike real sand-digging that we did not recognize it for years. Also, various authors have repeatedly commented upon the "nervous- ness" of an animal when making displacement movements, which of course means that the move- ments were somehow different from what the observer was used to. These differences between displacement activity and example are based on various principles, of which thus far we have discovered three. The incompleteness of the displacement activity. Displacement activities are usually incomplete in two respects. First, the act is often begun in a normal way but breaks off halfway. A fighting cock</page><page sequence="21">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 21 pecks at the ground but is never or rarely seen to pick anything up, let alone to swallow it. Displace- ment preening is often superficial and incomplete. Oystercatchers, avocets, turnstones, and other waders displacement-sleeping in front of an op- ponent often fail to close the eyes; and it is not at all unusual to see them make a mere half-hearted turning movement with the head, as if they are going to put the bill on the scapulars, but stop halfway, before they actually touch the plumage with the bill. It is now evident that this incompleteness is a matter of intensity. This was demonstrated by Van Iersel and myself in the case of the three- spined stickleback's threat posture. We could intensify the fighting by crowding several males in a relatively small tank, so that the individual territories were small and consequently the in- tensity of the fighting was high. The threat be- havior then developed into complete digging. It is possible to arrange a number of observed bound- ary-clashes according to intensity on the basis of various criteria, such as the frequency and intensity of real attacks, duration of fight, or distance from the center of the territory. Roughly speaking, the completeness of the displacement digging is then seen to increase with increasing intensity of the fighting drive. This increase in completeness of displacement digging can be compared with the increase of completeness of autochthonous digging during nest construction when, in the course of a short time, the digging develops from a mere bending down of the body, as in low-intensity threat, through a number of intermediate stages into complete digging. The striking fact is that both the completion of displacement digging and that of authochtonous digging pass through exactly the same sequence of intermediate stages. The displacement pecking of a lapwing dis- turbed at the nest will occasionally become so intensive that the bird actually captures and swallows worms. As a matter of fact, a colleague of mine who wanted to film a foraging lapwing succeeded by application of this knowledge. There is still another problem which I think has to do with this matter of intensities. For various reasons not discussed here, it is rather surprising that a drive of a relatively high order of complexity (such as the fighting drive) should, upon being thwarted, as a rule give rise only to sand-digging and not to all other types of nest- building as well. Only occasionally other nest-build- ing activities, such as collection of nest material and even actual building, may be seen to occur during or after a boundary clash. This seems to happen only after particularly intense fights. Now when one follows the sequence of activities during the whole nest-building cycle, it will be seen that sand-digging is the first element of this pattern to appear. When the frequency is plotted against time, sand-digging will be seen to increase in frequency, reach a peak, and then decrease again. Coinciding with this decrease other nest- building activities, such as the gathering of material, will appear. Soon they take over en- tirely, and digging ceases. This can be interpreted as an outcome of the growing intensity of the nest-building drive as a whole. Of all the systems subordinate to this drive, that of sand-digging has the lowest threshold. Consequently it appears first when the nest-building drive becomes acti- vated; and until the activation reaches the thresh- old of the next element (gathering of material), all the nest-building motivation is used for sand- digging. If this is true, it would explain why sand- digging is the most likely of all the nest-building activities to appear as a displacement activity, and also why, with a very high intensity of the fighting drive, other nest-building activities begin to appear as displacements. The incompleteness of the great majority of observed displacement activities is the more astonishing since they usually appear in situations of great "tension," that is to say, of strong but thwarted motivation, where experience leads us to expect behavior of full intensity. And as a matter of fact, when autochthonous behavior breaks through in such situations, it is always of high intensity. All these facts point to the con- clusion that displacement meets with a strong inner resistance, and that only a part of the impulses available for action in the underlying drive reaches the motor centers of the displace- ment activity. This explanation can probably explain another aspect of displacement activities as well. Several authors have commented upon what has been called a certain lack of orientation, or imperfect correlation with the object (Armstrong, 1950). It must be emphasized that the correlation with the object is by no means always imperfect; displacement bathing, displacement eating, dis- placement nesting are, as we have seen, complete and in perfect correlation with the object if</page><page sequence="22">22 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY only the intensity of the underlying drive(s) is high enough. Further, autochthonous activities show the same lack of correlation with the object when the drive is low. The only difference between the two cases is that the absolute level below which the activity loses connection with the object is so much lower in autochthonous behavior than in displacement behavior, but this is entirely in line with the phenomena discussed above. Superposition of autockthonous elements. The incompleteness of displacement activities is not the only aspect in which they differ from their autochthonous examples. This is obvious in the grass-pulling of herring gulls. That this is displaced collecting of nest material is clear from the con- centration on nest material as object and from the form of the movement: the material is often thrown away with the well-known sideways jerk- ing of the head found in so many Laro-Limicolae. The grass-pulling is different, however, from the autochthonous picking-up of nest material. First, an aggressive gull pecks into the grass or moss much more vigorously than it does when gathering nest material. Secondly, it often selects heavy grass-tufts or even roots that offer resistance to pulling, and it then pulls for all it is worth. Both the vigorous pecking and the pulling are instantly recognized when an actual fight is witnessed; they are part of the fighting pattern. To anyone who has seen a real fight it is clear that a grass-pulling gull treats the grass as it would treat the opponent if it only dared, or, in ethological terminology, if its fighting drive were not suppressed by its fleeing drive. The grass-pulling therefore differs from its example by a superposition of elements of the fighting pattern. In other words, it is a mixture of autochthonous and allochthonous elements. This superstructure of elements of fighting probably facilitates recognition by other gulls of this total gesture as threat. Superposition of autochthonous elements does not occur only in this particular behavior of the herring gull. There are more instances, and I believe it to be a widespread phenomenon. It should be distinguished from ritualization, a concept to be discussed later. Ritualization is the outcome of a secondary evolution. Superposition is probably there from the beginning. Superposition of autochthonous elements is one more indication that the interpretation of dis- placement activities as the result of a surplus of drive is correct. In the case of the grass-pulling it also points to another conclusion. When a conflict of drives is at the bottom of a displace- ment activity, it seems to be impossible to decide which drive furnishes the impulses for the displace- ment behavior: the fighting drive, the escape drive, or both. Kortlandt argues that it must be the fighting drive, because the escape drive really attains its end, namely, staying away from the enemy. I was never impressed by this argument and still think that the escape drive would be better satisfied if the animal fled altogether. But the fact that grass-pulling shows elements of the fighting pattern and not of the fleeing pattern seems to support Kortlandt's view. On the other hand, what would elements of the fleeing drive look like? Maybe it will be possible to study this in the stickleback, where activation of the fleeing drive causes not only movements, but also a change in color. If a threatening male stickleback were darker on the back than an attacking male, this would point to activity of the fleeing drive. I have made no observations on this point. A threatening male often erects one or both ventral spines, and this is not an element of attack but of defence. This suggests that the escape drive, as well as the attack drive, contributes to the displacement activity. As has already been indicated, ritualization is another principle responsible for differences between displacement activities and their ex- amples. This will be discussed after the releaser function has been dealt with. The biological significance of displacement activities Since displacement activities are so widespread, it seems improbable that they are a mere by- product, an accidental lack of elegance of the behavior system. On the contrary, I think we can distinguish two functions of displacement ac- tivities, a primary and a secondary one. Displacement activities as outlets. My attention was called to what I will call the primary function by Dr. Liddell of Cornell University in 1947. Following a discussion on displacement activities in birds and fish, Liddell demonstrated to me some instances in goats and sheep. In the Cornell University Experimental Farm, Liddell and his collaborators study "experimental neurosis" in various mammals. These are subjected to a treat- ment of weeks or months during which they are confined in a narrow pen several times a day, and</page><page sequence="23">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 23 get a heavy electric shock following a signal. The animals learn that the signal announces the shock, and between signal and shock they are subject to a strong tendency to escape. Actual escape, however, is blocked. This treatment results in the long run in "experimental neurosis," but long before neurosis becomes apparent the animals react to the signal by various displacement activities, usually movements belonging to the feeding patterns. This work seems to show that neurosis may be the result of long-continued thwarting of the escape drive. The fact that displacement activities appear before a neurotic stage is reached, or rather that neurosis follows a long period of thwarting of a drive and consequent displacement activity, indicates that outlet through displacement be- havior is a form of defence against neurotic dis- order of the central nervous system, enabling it to "get rid" of the surplus of impulses which would otherwise damage it. The fact that Liddell's animals could not entirely escape neurosis does not contradict this hypothesis; after all, an animal cannot be expected to be adapted to the continued impossibility of escaping from a heavy bombard- ment of electric shocks over months at a time. For these reasons I think it is probable that displace- ments do serve a function as outlets, through a safety valve, of dangerous surplus impulses. Displacement activities as social releasers. In many cases, displacement activities are reacted to by other individuals belonging to the same species. We have experimental proof, for instance, of the intimidating influence of displacement digging in the three-spined stickleback. This is of course why it is justifiable to call it threat behavior. It can scarcely be doubted that grass-pulling in herring gulls has also threat value. And although experimental proof has been provided in few, if any, cases, I do not think we need doubt that many displacement activities, particularly such as form part of threat or of courtship and pre- coition behavior, act as social releasers (for a review see Tinbergen, 1948). The evolution of displacement activities Ritualization. When displacement activities which have this releaser significance are compared with those that have no influence on members of the same species, it is at once obvious that in the first category the differences between the dis- placement activities and their autochthonous examples are much larger than in the second category. In both categories the incompleteness and superposition of autochthonous elements can be observed, but the releaser group has some- thing in addition. It may even be impossible to recognize a releaser as a displacement activity at all, until comparison with less specialized move- ments in closely related species reveals its origin. Comparison here renders essentially the same service as in morphology: it may reveal homologies. The "same" displacement activity is often found in all members of a group of closely related species, and the differences between species can often be shown to be due to adaptive radiation. Thus Lorenz (1935) reports that all cranes show dis- placement preening in hostile situations. In the Manchurian crane, however, the threat behavior is so different from preening that nobody would interpret it as such, if comparison did not show that it is only an extreme case of displacement preening; it is connected with species in which the movement is obviously displacement preening by forms which are (in this respect) intermediate. Similar conditions can be observed in the stickle- backs where the movement of ventilating the eggs ("fanning") is used as an outlet of a thwarted sexual urge. In one species these movements are so different from true fanning that they could hardly be recognized without comparison with other species. These facts have led to the hypothesis that such displacement activities as have the function of releasing responses in other individuals have ac- quired it secondarily. This new function must have started a new evolutionary development during, which the displacement activities became in- creasingly better adapted to it. This evolutionary development I have called "ritualization," fol- lowing Huxley (1923). The nature of the process itself is not known, although obviously selection has to do with it. Its results however are clear, and a study of these results, or the differences between strongly ritualized displacement activi- ties and non-releasing displacement activities, will enable us to describe what principles of change have been involved. In my previous papers on the subject (1940, 1947) I had not yet clearly realized the difference between ritualization as the secondary evolu- tionary change, and superposition of autochtho- nous elements. Much of what I considered then to be ritualization is in reality, I think, due to super-</page><page sequence="24">24 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLGY position. The distinction is essential, because superposition may be quite independent of evolu- tionary change. Because I realized the importance of superposition only recently (having completely forgotten that I mentioned it in my 1940 paper), I have at present no clear idea of what ritualiza- tion comprises. Some facts, however, stand out -clearly. Morphological support. First, ritualization implies the development of conspicuous morphological structures which are demonstrated by the dis- placement activity. The best-known examples are found among ducks (Lorenz, 1941). The male mandarin duck has, among its dark green second- aries, one in which the inner vane is extremely broadened and orange colored. This huge orange flag stands out permanently, and the displace- ment preening of the courting drake is nothing but an emphatic touching of this vane with the bill. Exaggeration and simplification of the movement. The development of such a conspicuous structure runs parallel with an adaptive change in the displacement movement itself. This is not only obvious in the mandarin duck, but also in the garganey. Here the primary coverts form a con- spicuous light-blue patch. Whereas in most ducks the displacement preening brings out the speculum, the bill touching the inner side of the wing, the garganey does not touch the second- aries, nor is the wing lifted to allow the bill to preen its inside, but the bill points at, or actually touches, the blue patch. In these cases the change in the movement is an adaptation to the function of showing off a conspicuous structure. The movement can also undergo changes serving to make the movement itself more con- spicuous. This is done by exaggerating the move- ment by slowing it down and by increasing its amplitude. Instances may again been found in the ducks, and also in pigeons. For instance, Craig (1909) reported that the blond ring dove male "shows eros, by a certain spasmodic preening of the inside of the wing" (p. 67). So far as our knowledge goes, it seems that, in the process of ritualization, certain elements are exaggerated, other elements tend to disappear entirely. Ritualization therefore is addition as well as simplification; in short, it is schematizing. All these changes seem to aim at one end: adaptation to the responsive capacities of the reacting individual. It is becoming more and more obvious that innate behavior usually responds to "sign stimuli," to only a few aspects of the total situation. The social releasers seem to be "ma- terialized sign stimuli"; as a result of adaptation to this type of responsiveness. It is in line with this that releasers seem, perhaps always, to release innate, not conditioned, responses. The differentiation of displacement preening in ducks by ritualization in directions different in each species has presumably to do with the de- mand of specificity typical of all social releasers, and particularly those which act as sexual isolating mechanisms. Neurophysiological "emancipation." Ritualization of a displacement activity, resulting in an increase of the difference between it and its original ex- ample, has of course neurophysiological implica- tions. When the movement changes through rituali- zation, this means that the underlying nervous mechanism changes and thus becomes different from that of its example. In this way ritualiza- tion brings about a kind of emancipation. The further ritualization proceeds, the more the move- ment loses its displacement character and be- comes an element of the drive which uses it as an outlet. It is of course impossible to draw a line between what is "still" a displacement activity and what is "already" an independent element of the drive which uses it, unless one uses arbi- trary criteria. The only thing one can say in such cases is that a movement was originally a dis- placement activity. The study of ritualization therefore reveals to us a way in which "new" behavior elements may appear during evolution. Before an activity is ritualized, its nature as a derived movement may be easily recognized. Through gradual adaptive change it may become so different from any other behavior element that eventually it ceases to be a derived movement and becomes a "new" type of behavior. Conclusion Although it will, I hope, be clear that the avail- able evidence is still fragmentary, and that con- tinued, systematic research is desirable, what evi- dence I have been able to present seems to be sufficient to form, with some confidence, a theory on the nature of displacement activities. Two aspects seem to be essential: the "irrele- vant" nature of displacement activities, and their dependence on excess of drive. The irrelevance, or</page><page sequence="25">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 25 the fact that the movement shown does not belong to the executive pattern of the drive which is activated, making the movements to appear "out of context," is, as the name indicates, the very essence of the concept. It is the irrelevance which makes us single out these movements as something requiring explanation and is the phe- nomenon to be explained. It is therefore highly confusing to label an activity as a displacement activity when it is not certainly irrelevant, or worse, when it is clearly not irrelevant. Because the concept has become popular it is now often handled in this uncritical and loose way. This, as Heinroth (1944) pointed out, only tends to blur the whole issue. The confusion to which this dropping of the basic criterion leads is well il- lustrated by the following passage quoted from Armstrong (1950): "Is the persistent display... of an ocellated turkey, Agriocharis ocellata, which I have seen displaying persistently while alone in its cage, to be regarded as normal, overflow, or displacement activity? The display is normal in so far as the movements are similar to those of a bird in normal circumstances. It can be regarded as overflow activity to the extent that it finds ex- pression when the stimulus from the perceptual field is suboptimal; and it can be considered a displacement activity if we suppose that its sustained character arose as a result of the pro- longed absence of the female, and it can then be ascribed to the absence of an external stimulus- link" (p. 374). Of course, only analysis can settle which of the three explanations is correct. The persistent display while alone in the cage must be considered overflow display and not normal display if analysis shows, as we may expect, that display in the absence of a female is exceptional. Only thorough study can tell us that, but once we know, it is no longer a matter of taste whether one calls the display normal or an overflow ac- tivity. Whether it was a displacement activity or not could only be judged when we had indications about the nature of the bird's motivation at that time, so that we knew whether the activity was "fed" by its own or by another drive. By conclud- ing that an activity must be a displacement ac- tivity because of the absence of an "external stimulus-link," Armstrong is reversing the argu- ment. It is true that displacement behavior is sometimes dependent upon absence of a stimulus, but the reverse is of course not true. Whether "displaying persistently while alone" is displace- ment activity or not depends upon whether the display is a movement belonging to the activated drive or not, and it takes study to find that out. Because such unanalyzed and incidental ob- servations are used as arguments again and again in Armstrong's and in other discussions, it cannot be stressed too much that a detailed knowledge of the whole behavior pattern is an absolute pre- requisite for the critical interpretation of an al- leged displacement activity. One needs to know to which of the executive patterns an activity belongs, and also which drive is activated at the moment the activity is seen. This is only possible after prolonged observation, and therefore in- cidental observations are almost worthless. True, the form of the movement can often be recognized at a glance; but to know which drive is active at the moment requires more than a glance. The uncertainty in the case cited by Armstrong is due to the absence of these analytical data. To reason, as Armstrong has, that this uncertainty is due "not to deficiencies in our observation or analysis but to basic similarities" (p. 375) is to cover up dissimilarities where analysis shows them to exist. It is quite correct to stress basic similarities where thorough study proves them to exist, but it is confusing when it is done on the basis of ab- sence of evidence. There is an enjoyable synthetic trend in modern science to see the relative value and the artificial nature of many partitions, but it is deplorable wilfully to ignore criteria of dis- crimination or to neglect the search for them. We have seen that displacement activities which have releaser function tend, through ritualization, to lose their allochthonous character and to become autochthonous. In this respect, therefore, no sharp boundary can be drawn between displacement and autochthonous behavior. It is also true that dis- placement-sleep during a fight is a more extreme case than displacement-nesting, because nesting and fighting both belong to the major reproductive drive, whereas sleep does not belong to it. Sleep therefore can be said to be "more irrelevant" in a fight than nest-building. But all this does not in the least relieve us from the need to distinguish between displacement and autochthonous be- havior. Concluding, I propose that the concept of displacement activity be defined in the following way: "A displacement activity is an activity be- longing to the executive motor pattern of an instinct other than the instinct(s) activated."</page><page sequence="26">26 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY The analysis carried out by Kortlandt and my- self allows us to add a second criterion: there must be a surplus of drive. Although I must admit that there are many cases known, or rather half-known, where the irrelevance of the activity is dear but where there is uncertainty about the existence of an excess of drive, the excess has been demon- strated in the more thoroughly studied cases, and it seems probable that it is a general feature of displacement activities. However, this is a hypoth- esis about the causation, while the irrelevance is a matter of observed fact. I therefore suggest that the definition given above should continue as follows: "A displacement activity seems to appear when an activated drive is denied discharge through its own consummatory act(s)." It is pos- sible to describe at least two conditions which can prevent autochthonous discharge, namely, conflict between antagonistic drives, and absence of indispensable releasing stimuli, but it seems possible that future study of unanalyzed cases will reveal other causes. III. INTENTION MOVEMENTS Intention movements as expressions of low motivation In the introductory sketch of the theory of innate behavior I pointed out that certain be- havior elements may appear in varying degrees of intensity. Up to now I have been discussing mainly the outcome of motivation of high intensity. We must now consider low-intensity movements, for they are not only very common, but they are also another source of derived movements. When a song bird, or a pigeon, or a duck, is flying off, it starts by jumping up into the air, so as to be as far away from the ground as possible before the wings come into play. Daanje (1950), who has studied various aspects of bird locomotion in detail, has described how in preparation for the hop the bird not only bends the "heel"-joints, but also the hip-joints (bending the front half of the body downward, and lifting the hind half); further, it withdraws the neck, lifts the wings slightly away from the body, and erects the tail. In the actual take-off, the action of all these parts can be compared with a loosely coiled spring that is relaxed after having first been pushed in. "The maximum effect is reached when the stretching is performed by the whole spring. In much the same way, a leaping bird does not confine the stretching to the legs but uses the muscles of legs, body, and neck" (p. 50). As remarked above, many behavior patterns, even relatively simple ones, consist of introductory appetitive behavior followed by one or more con- summatory acts. In many cases the appetitive behavior consists of going toward something, or of going away from something. In other words, many types of appetitive behavior consist of directed locomotion. This is why incomplete movements caused by a drive of low intensity, are in most cases just incomplete locomotory movements. In the case of flying, hopping, or walking (which is nothing but a kind of alternate hopping of left and right half of the body), low-intensity move- ments may be no more than the first (with- drawing), or the first followed by the second (stretching) phase of the jump. Every observer knows these half-hearted starting movements; I need not give more examples. They must not necessarily be locomotory movements; I refer to the description given of the various grades of low- intensity sand digging of the three-spined stickle- back. Heinroth called attention to these incomplete movements long ago (1911); he named them in- tention movements ("Intentionsbewegungen"), because they betray to the observer what the animal is "intending" to do. Lorenz (1941) gave a detailed account of some of these intention movements in surface-feeding ducks, but on the whole they have received less attention than dis- placement activities. Yet many field observers have a detailed knowledge of intention movements and use them to a great extent, often uncon- sciously. Especially in the beginning of the re- productive season intention movements may be very common, and the ability to recognize them is of fundamental importance for a correct inter- pretation of the drives which govern the behavior at a given moment. In an important paper, Daanje (1950) showed that by a detailed descriptive study of complete movements it is possible to recognize intention movements with more precision and more cer- tainty, and he showed that intention movements are even more common than hitherto recognized. It is unnecessary to give a summary of his highly stimulating account here; for a critical apprecia- tion it is necessary to read the original paper. It need scarcely be emphasized that although intention movements are formally similar to, and may even be identical with, displacement ac- tivities (both showing the same kind of incom-</page><page sequence="27">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 27 pleteness), they differ basically as regards the underlying causes: intention movements are autochthonous movements. Ambivalent combinations of intention movements Above, I described the upright threat posture of a herring gull and interpreted it as the simul- taneous combination of the intention movements of attack and withdrawal. I believe that such ambiv- alent combinations of the intention movements of two different, antagonistic patterns are much more common than is recognized at present. In several cases it is easy to recognize the two com- ponents, especially when they are linked in suc- cession. This is the case in the "pendulum duels" which I described above. In the three-spined stickleback, the tendency to attack a female entering the territory, and the tendency, aroused simultaneously, to lead her to the nest (the ap- petitive behavior of egg-fertilization, or mating) are combined into a movement which at first glance does not give the impression of being a "derived" movement at all. As a matter of fact, we had seen it many thousands of times, season after season, before we became aware of its ambivalent nature. It would be very worth while to study various forms of display from this point of view, because it could give us important information about the nature of the animal's motivation. Ritualized intention movements; parallel evolution of displacement and intention movements It is not at all surprising that many animals have evolved, on the instinctive plane, the same ability as the bird watcher on a higher psychologi- cal level, namely, that of recognizing the nature of another individual's motivation by the latter's intention movements, and that, therefore, in- tention movements often have releaser function. In fact, this is much less surprising than responses to displacement activities, and I believe that displacement activities could only acquire releaser function because they often alternate with autochthonous movements. Now these intention movements which have acquired releaser function have clearly undergone an evolutionary change of the same type as dis- placement activities; they have been "ritualized." On the whole, this ritualization seems to have followed the same lines in both cases, which sup- ports our hypothesis that ritualization is adapta- tion to the releaser function. Morphological support As in displacement activities, conspicuous mor- phological features have evolved which accentuate the movement. This is particularly obvious in one of the courtship movements of ducks, called by Lorenz "das Kurzhochwerden" ("shortening-up posture"). As examples I reproduce two of Daan- je's pictures, redrawn after Lorenz, of the mal- lard (Fig. 10) and the pintail (Fig. 11), respec- /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~... ...

Many of the grotesque courtship postures of gallinaceous birds seem also to be derived from the huddled first phase of the hop, (showing the tendency to proceed towards the female), and the variety of adornment used for demonstration in these displays is simply bewildering. Further adaptation of the movement to the demonstration function As with displacement activities, there has been in intention movements a parallel evolution of the movement itself, serving to perfect the demonstra- tion of the color. The threat-display of the robin, so well known since the work of Lack (1939), is believed by Daanje to be derived from the huddled phase of the hop. Subsequent or parallel evolution has added a curious orientation component to it: the bird turns the red breast towards the opponent, whether it is to the left or to the right, above or below. Exaggeration and simplification Again, as in displacement activities, the move- ment can undergo changes which make it more conspicuous by itself; this is often an alternative to the development of conspicuous morphological structures. Thus the garganey and the Chilean teal exaggerate parts of the movement (throwing back the head in the former, lifting the breast in the latter). This coincides with a regression of other elements of the movement, such as, in these cases, the lifting of the tail. Probably this exag- geration of parts of the movement at the cost of other parts is the same phenomenon as that called "shifting of thresholds of component ele- ments" by Daanje. As in displacement activities, therefore, ritualization may simplify the pattern, thus adapting it to send out simple but conspicuous "sign stimuli." Loss of coordination Finally, Daanje mentions loss of coordination between components as a principle of ritualization of intention movements. One very common form of coordination is synchronization, absolute or relative (von Holst, 1937), of the various parts of the movement, such as those of the tail, the wings, the legs, and the neck. Ritualization may cause these parts to "get away" from the sychronizing influences of the central nervous system, "al- lowing" them, so to speak, to have their own tempo independent of those of the other elements. I do not at present know of similar phenomena in displacement activities, but I have never studied them from this point of view. These few remarks may suffice to indicate the close parallels that seem to exist between the ritualization of displacement activities and that of intention movements. Further detailed study is promising. The work done so far is no more than a first tentative step. IV. "REVERSED 1 MOVEMENTS One of the elements of courtship of the black- headed gull is "head flagging." When sex partners, or prospective mates meet, they stretch their necks and turn the head away from each other with a sudden, jerky movement. This has been interpreted as the reverse, or opposite, of the "forward display," one of the species' threat postures, which consists of a lowering of the head while the beak is pointed forward. This threat gesture is made more conspicuous by the brown face. It is characteristic of the head flagging that instead of showing off the weapon (the bill) and the brown face, it conceals them. It is supposed that this movement acts as an appeasing gesture, because it is exactly the opposite of the threat posture. Similar appeasing gestures, which are really the opposite of threat gestures, are found in many species; since the bill (or in the case of mammals the teeth) are usually shown off in threat, the appeasing ceremonies often consist of turning the occiput towards the opponent (Tin- bergen and Moynihan, 1952). V. TOWARDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DISPLAY Not so long ago there was an enormous gap be- tween our understanding of "ordinary" activities such as feeding and nest building on the one hand, and all kinds of display on the other. It was rela- tively easy to understand not only what useful purpose the first type of activities served, but also something of their causation. Internal factors were known to be influential, and were named drives, instincts, urges, or the like. Moreover, it was known that the behavior was to some extent a reaction to stimuli emanating from the outside object to which the activity was related. But all kinds of display were much less easy to under- stand, as regards both their function and their causation. Displays were admittedly beautiful and striking, or they were found to be "curious,"</page><page sequence="29">"DERIVED" ACTIVITIES 29 "remarkable," "odd," and so on, but about their functions no more was known for a long time than that they were somehow stimulating or pleasing to the female, and were therefore enhanced by sexual selection. This all has changed. We now begin to under- stand the function of displays, their relation with underlying causes, and their evolution. Functions of display Many different functions of display have been discovered. Some serve as threat or intimidation, some serve to stimulate individuals of the other sex, to attract them or to raise their sexual drive generally. It has been suggested by Huxley (1914) that some serve to strengthen the pair bond. There are further displays which serve to tie the partner to the nest site (Tinbergen, 1935). Other displays have a "diversionary" function (Arm- strong, 1949), and so on. It is Lorenz's merit to have seen the common element in all these dis- plays: they are "social releasers" ("Ausl6ser"); they are all adapted to the function of sending out stimuli to which other individuals react, usually innately. The reaction is sometimes very simple, immediate, and overt, but in many cases it is internal, a gradual change, in a positive or a nega- tive sense, in the intensity of a drive, which does not at once express itself in overt action, but which increases or decreases the readiness to react. In such cases the releaser function is less obvious and has even been doubted. The term could perhaps better be replaced by "signal" or some such term to prevent these misunderstand- ings; this, however, does not impair the value of the all-embracing conclusion that all displays elicit specific reactions in other individuals. In most cases these "reactors" belong to the same species; they are either sex partners, or social companions, or parents, or chicks. In the case of diversionary and defence displays they affect predators and are adapted to this function in fundamentally the same way. They either release flight or withdrawal, or, as in diversionary dis- plays, they release pursuit. In a very valuable paper, Baerends (1950) has shown that there are many more types of releasers with an interspecific function than those known to exist in birds; many insects and plants have evolved behavior or structures which have in common the one feature that they are all adap- tations to the releaser function. Whether intraspecific releasers in birds do more than effect changes in the reactor's nervous system and effect "somatic" (endocrine) changes as well, as has been suggested by Darling (1938), is still undecided, although it seems probable in some cases. Some authors mention displays serving "recog- nition" as a function separate from the releasing or stimulating function. This is a confusion of thought and of terminology. When a certain dis- play releases a reaction in another bird which cannot be released either by an individual of another species or of the other sex, this specific display enables the reactor to "recognize" the displaying individual as one of a class, say, as a sexually active male of the same species. "Recog- nition" is a descriptive term, indicating that an animal reacts to one special type of display and not to others. The female mallard reacts specif- ically to the mallard drake's display and not to others. Another and legitimate way of saying the same thing is to state that she "recognizes" the displaying bird as a mallard drake. The more specific and selective the reaction to a releaser is, the more we are inclined to speak of "recognition." But these differences of degree exist in the effect of the releaser just as well as in the precision of the "recognition," and every display can be said to serve recognition with as much justification as it can be said to serve the release of reactions. If "recognition" is used to indicate the subjective state accompanying selective response, the term is the exact subjective counterpart of the etho- logical term "selective response." On the highly integrated level of behavior we can use both ethological (biological) and psychological (sub- jective) terminology (at least when we believe in projecting our own subjective experiences into animals); they run parallel. A courtship display can be said to release a sexual reaction and to raise sexual emotion; an intimidating display can be said to release escape or withdrawal and to cause fear. But to say that one type of display causes escape or withdrawal, and another type causes fear, is to make a distinction on the basis of two different criteria. The result is that phenomena studied from both angles will be discovered to belong in both categories, and that only such phenomena as have been studied from one of the two angles can be distinguished, not because they are different, but because we happen to see only one of our criteria in one case, and the other</page><page sequence="30">30 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY criterion in the other case. One could just as well divide tumblers into two categories, one that serves to contain liquid, and another that is beautiful. The causes of display A second step in the understanding of display is the recognition of so many types as displace- ment activities or intention movements, for the analysis of these types gives us an idea of the causes underlying display. Display in aggressive behavior and in sexual behavior baffles us because it seems as if it does not follow the relatively simple rules that apply to "ordinary" behavior. The pattern of the feeding drive can be described rather satisfactorily as a series of appetitive be- havior patterns followed by one or more consum- matory acts-searching for prey, going towards it, catching it, killing it, eating it. But this frame- work cannot be applied at first sight to all these displays. An aggressive gull does not merely go towards an opponent and attack it, but it adopts an upright threat-posture, does some grass-pulling, and chokes. It may even do all this instead of attack. Our analysis has enabled us to see that the general scheme can certainly be applied, and that the simultaneous activation of two drives causes complications which in themselves can be under- stood on the same general principles as hold for any "ordinary" kind of behavior. Ambivalent combinations of low-intensity movements, and displacement activities arising from strong but thwarted motivation ("tension") are the result of this complicated situation. Hinde (1951) has shown convincingly that the many types of ag- gressive behavior of the great tit can be understood in the same way. Further, the same principles have been applied successfully in the unravelling of the mating behavior of the three-spined stickleback (to be published elsewhere). It has shown that mating behavior can be understood as well as aggressive behavior by applying the same principles. In the three instances mentioned (herring gull, great tit, stickleback), all originally inexplicable ele- ments have been proved to be derived movements of the types discussed in the present paper. Such complete analyses have been attempted only in these few cases. All the other evidence mentioned in the present paper applies to isolated parts of display. It is therefore still impossible to say that all display will, upon closer inspection, be proved to be nothing but combinations of dis- placement activities and intention movements, in simple or more integrated form-although in the light of the analyses of the herring gull, cor- morant, ducks, sticklebacks, and tits one gets that impression. The main reason why it is as yet impossible to say whether these two categories exhaust the possibilities is the fact that ritualization must have changed so many derived activities into "new," still puzzling forms. To unravel these, detailed study of closely related species will be necessary. Such study, leading to a clearer insight into the nature of the drives underlying these complicated behavior patterns, and to a picture of surprising simplicity compared with the baffling complexity of the overt behavior, is highly re- warding. The evolution of display It is curious that, through the discovery of ritualization, the study of the evolution of innate behavior patterns has proceeded farther with derived movements than with "ordinary" be- havior. This is of course mainly owing to the change of function, from merely relief of impulses ("safety-valve") to releaser function. Even here, however, the study of evolution is still in its infancy. It has just been possible to indicate, very vaguely, some "principles of ritualization." Further comparative study, in which (1) the ori- gin, (2) the mixture with other elements prior to evolution as a releaser (superposition of autoch- thonous elements, and addition of intention movements of other drives, respectively), and (3) the later changes will have to be well distinguished, will doubtlessly reveal much of extreme interest. It is very probable that comparison will need to comprise not only closely related species, but different subspecies of single species as well. Thus the study of display has entered a most fascinating phase. The work of the last decade or two, itself based on much preparatory work by Whitman, Heinroth, Selous, and Huxley (to name only a few of the most important pioneers), has been just sufficient to make us see along what lines further study can proceed.
