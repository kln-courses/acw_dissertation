Andrew Marvell, 'The Garden'.1 Gardens, horticulture and their literary representation intersected with many of the critical, defining social transformations of the early modern period; from shifting patterns of land use to evolving political discourses of magnifi cence and power, new scientific ideas about the natural world, botany and medicinal writing, religious changes and aesthetics. The natural world was invoked to justify and make sense of unprecedented social, cultural and political change. However, gardens also reflected new forms of self-fashioning, leisure and pleasure. Garden history has not been revolutionized by the emergence of environmental criticism, instead gardens have become inter twined in other disciplinary areas from archaeology to gender studies, art history to literary studies. This volume seeks to demonstrate the ubiquity of the garden in Renaissance culture, whether as metaphor, symbol or real space, as a site for contemplation, agricultural production or cultural inscription, and at the same time reflect the diversity and range of academic writing on the subject. Woodcut illustrations in herbals (medicinal treatises about plants) were pirated and reused to the point of being unrecognizable and of no practical use in the identification and classification of plants. This points to the persistent tension between experience and authority in the way the natural world was understood. The emergence of horticulture and botany as 1 John Dixon Hunt (ed.), The Oxford Book of Garden Verse (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993), 56.

Attempts to read historic gardens aesthetically point to the inadequacy of art historical categories like 'Renaissance' or 'Baroque' and the differences not simply between national but also regional traditions. Changing fashions in flowers reflected a democratization of the garden and its appropriation for aesthetic, non-utilitarian ends, as a space for new forms of leisure, contemplation and moral improvement. The changing role gardens played in mediating between people and the natural world were reflected and appropriated in literature and art. The complex interplay between poetics and gardening saw art understood through metaphors drawn from the garden and the garden recast as a living form of art. WRITING GARDENS IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE: BOTANY, HORTICULTURE AND LITERATURE The explosion of writing on gardens and horticulture in the early modern period, beginning with translations and printings of classical authors, reflected the different ways in which the return to nature was used to ground and make sense of the shifting relationship between people and the natural environment. In the case of England, Xenophon's treatise on household management and agriculture, the Oeconomicus, for example, was published in a Latin translation as early as 1508 and then reprinted in five further editions by 1526, before being Englished in 1532. Virgil's Eclogues/Bucolics and Georgics appeared in English in 1575 and 1589 in translations by Abraham Fleming. An underlying factor in the growing popularity of writings on agriculture and gardening was economic: low rents and labour costs alongside rising food prices as a result of the growing population persuaded landowners to end demesne and enter into commercial farming, taking closer economic control of how their estates were managed. This return to farming by magnates after generations without direct experience of agriculture was accompanied by a practical interest in classical writing on husbandry.2 Barnabe Googe, a kinsman of William Cecil, and major conduit for the dissemination of Spanish literary culture in England, translated in 1577 the German humanist and servant of the Duke of Cleves, Konrad Heresbach's Four Books of Husbandry, first published in Latin 1570.3 At precisely this time, Cecil was expanding and 2 Joan Thirsk, 'Making a Fresh Start: Sixteenth-Centuiy Agriculture and the Classical Tradition', in Michael Leslie and Timothy Raylor (eds.), Culture and Cultivation in Early Modern England: Writing and the Land (London: Leicester University Press, 1992), 15-34, esp. 15-16 and 19. 3 Ibid., 25. Googe translated Jorge de Montemayor's Diana, the most widely read pastoral novel in early modern Spain and was the first person to translate verse by Garcilaso de la Vega, whose Eglogas, an imitatio Castilianising Viriglian landscape resonated in the Spanish literary imagination throughout the rest of the century.</page><page sequence="3">Gardens and horticulture in the Renaissance developing 'the most influential Elizabethan garden' at Theobalds, which was overseen by the herbalist John Gerard, who dedicated his Herball to Burghley in 1597.4 Alongside a revived aristocratic interest in agriculture, a democratizing impulse is apparent throughout Europe in much writing on gardens. The first gardening handbook to appear in England, Thomas Hill's A Most Briefe and Pleasaunt Treatyse howe to dress, sowe and set a Garden of circa 1558 aimed 'to please the common sort, for whose onelye sake, I have taken these paines and have published this Booke'.5 A similar popularizing aim had impelled William Turner, father of English botany, whose works were condemned in 1546 under Henry VIII and in 1555 under Mary, to publish Libellus de Re herbaria ( 1538) and then translate it as The Names of Herbes ( 1548). He complained that his plant list was needed because herbalists were not communicating their knowledge to their fellow Englishmen.6 Eleven herbals and eight horticultural treatises appeared in England across the sixteenth century.7 The first book in English dedicated exclusively to vegetable growing was Richard Gardiner's Profitable Instructions for the Manuring, Sowing and Planting of Kichin Gardens of 1603, while the first book to focus on flowers was John Parkinson's Paradisi in sole paradisus terrestris or A Garden of all sorts of pleasant Flowers of 1629.8 Perhaps the biggest selling book of poetry from the Elizabethan period with eighteen editions before the end of the century, was Thomas Tusser's agricultural treatise A hundredth good pointes of husbandrie of 1557, expanded in a second edition of 1562 to consider more fully 'huswifery'; and eventually becoming the Fiue hundredth points of good husbandry in 1573.9 Tusser took it for granted that the garden was the special province of the housewife, listing the plants she should grow. Ironically, this horticultural theorist was less than successful as a farmer; unsuccessfully attempting to farm at Cattiwade in Suffolk, then West Dereham, Norfolk and finally Fairsted in Essex. Tusser's text is also of interest for its defence of enclosure. Underlying changes in land usage in this period played out against this background of an increasingly informed and textually mediated understand ing of cultivation. Rising food prices, then as now, did not just add impetus to commercial farming, but also made it more attractive for private individuals to grow their own. Tusser was dismissed by Gabriel Harvey as a poet 'for common 4 Roy Strong, The Renaissance Garden in England (London: Thames and Hudson, 2nd ed., 1998), 52 and 54. 5 The only extant copy of the first edition is in the University of Glasgow library and is undated: Thomas Hill, A Most Briefe and Pleasaunt Treatyse howe to dress, sowe and set a Garden (London: Thomas Marsh, 2nd ed. 1563), cited in Martin Hoyles, Gardeners Delight: Gardening Books from 1560 to 1960 (London: Pluto Press, 1994), 7. 6 Ibid., 9. 7 Ibid. 8 Richard Gardiner, Profitable Instructions for the Manuring, Sowing and Planting of Kichin Gardens by Richard Gardiner (London: Edward Allde for Edward White, 1603) andjohn Parkinson, Paradisi in soleparadisus terrestris or A Garden of all sorts of pleasant Rowers which our English ayre will permit to be noursed up (London: Thomas Cotes for Richard Royston, 1629).

On the other hand, he underlined that 'no metiéndome en las médicinales, sino en aquellas que tienen buena flor y vista . . . podré decir con razön ser yo el primera que escribe esta materia' [I do not deal with medicinal plants but rather pretty ones with flowers ... I can rightly say that I am the first person to do so] and 'Debiéndoseme dar crédito en lo que por experiencia he descubier to ... no se puede probar con autoridades de otros' [I should be trusted for what I have discovered through experience... it can not be proved according to the authority of others].12 Not only were the precise status of gardening and horticulture as branches of knowledge being negotiated in this period, but also who the space of the garden belonged to, whether professional or amateur, male or female, landlord or commoner. The very function of gardens themselves was also the subject of debate, whether utility or pleasure, contemplation or commerce, science or art. POLITICAL LANDSCAPES Until the fifteenth century, gardens had depended on empirical experience and were not seen as works of art, lacking an underlying conceptual process. By the mid-sixteenth century, however, gardens had begun to reflect the ideas of architects like Francesco di Giorgio and Sebastiano Serlio, involving con ceptual thinking, models and drawing. With the concept of the garden as a work of art came iconography, gardens that told a story through their inter twining of motifs, themes, and complex mythological schema. Giovanni Bat tista Ferrari's 1633 De florum cultura provided the first complete theory of garden design akin to those formulated for architecture. Botany, aquatic engineering, and the medicinal uses of plants, as well as their association with cookery, tipped the balance of gardening and gardens towards being consid ered liberal rather than merely mechanical arts.13 Leon Battista Alberti was 10 Oxford, Dictionary of National Biography, http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27898 (accessed Novem ber 2010). 11 On botanical gardens, see John Prest, The Garden of Eden: The Botanic Garden and the Re-creation of Paradise (New Haven: Yales University Press, 1981). 12 Gregorio de los Rios, Argicultura defardines (Madrid: P.

He wrote a twenty-nine canto, 23,000 line-plus poem, Laurentina (c. 1580-90) for Philip II. Only a fragment (seven cantos) survives in a manuscript presentation copy at the Biblioteca de El Escorial with the dedication, first canto and those parts of the poem relating to San Lorenzo (cantos 24-28).16 The poem's protagonist is the river Tagus, who describes the woods of Aranjuez (canto 1, octaves 32-97) and the estate around the monastery at El Escorial (canto 24, octaves 36 - 97), and the gardens annexed to it (canto 26, octaves, 17 - 9).16 An even more striking example of this process of dignification was the French gardener and land scape architect André Le Nôtre, who when offered a coat of arms by Louis XIV suggested that they should figure three snails, a cabbage and a spade.17 Large formal gardens were expressions of power and courtly magnificence. When Richmond Palace was rebuilt by Henry VII following a fire that destroyed the old palace in 1497, it became the first in England to possess extensive formal gardens.18 His son's first essay into gardens at Hampton Court Palace in the 1530s with alterations first to the Privy Orchard and then the Privy Garden were captured in Anthonis van Wyngaerde's famous pan orama of Hampton Court from the Thames, circa 1558.19 Gardens reflected the magnificence of their creator's mind 'magnificenza dell'animo suo': 'exotic planting and expensive ornamentation of ephemeral materials con veyed the magnificence of a garden's owner, so too did the ordered squares and rows of trees, manifested above all in a view of that garden.'20 Visual depictions of gardens, painted or engraved views, followed conventions and sought to replicate the modes of viewing gardens that their layout and design encoded, with raised walkways (as at Hampton court or Valladolid in 1605) or parterres creating specific ways of seeing and reading the spaces. Knot gardens, formal terraces and walkways symbolized through geometry, the ability to shape and control of nature.

Gardens were frequently invoked in political discourse as a metaphor for the ideal republic; their harmonious unity of sense and smell, animal and plant life, contemplative and spiritual qualities, evoked nostalgia for a prelapsarian Eden, a golden age when every need was supplied by nature's spontaneous, natural abundance free from conflicts brought about by private property. By the second half of the seventeenth century in England, cultivation, in this case of trees, was seen as political in this way. The first major publication of John Evelyn, now generally known as a diarist, the first 'Publique Fruit of your Royal Society' as he wrote in the dedication to Charles II, was about 'Woods, [which] contrib ute to your Power, as to our greatest Wealth and Safety . . . For, as no Jewel in your Majesties resplendent Crown can render you so much Lustre and Glory as your regards to Navigation.'22 Forest, chase and warren had been tradition ally exempt from common law and forbidden to any but the king 'privileged for wild beasts and foules', 'for his princely delight and pleasure, which Territorie of ground, so privileged, is meered and bounded with unremov able, markes, meeres, and boundaries'.23 The laws governing forests had fallen into disuse by the Restoration and the resultant change of land use had led to the cutting down and decimation of plantations that Evelyn objected to. He underlined the fact that Pliny and Cicero had ' disdain'd not to exercise themselves in these Rusticities'.24 The virtuous republican ideal and citizen in contrast to the decadence and corruption of imperial Rome was often sym bolized by the figure of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, the Roman called away from his plough to save the republic. In the accompanying almanac, Evelyn's patriotism extended to a concern for his fellow countrymen's spiritual well being: As Paradise (though of Gods own Planting) had not been Paradise longer then the Man was put into it, to Dress it and to keep it. .. there is not a more laborious life then is that of a good Gard'ners; but a labour full of tranquility, 21 See the discussion of the philosophical garden in Justus Lipsius, De constantia/ On Constancy (1605), trans.

In sum, a condition it is, furnish'd with the most innocent, laudable and purest of earthly felicities, and such as does certainly make the neerest approaches to that Blessed state, where only they enjoy all things without pains25 The cottage garden came to be seen as a site for self-improvement, a symbol of fruitful labour and the morally salutary effects of gardens. The word para dise derived from Old Persian meaning an enclosure, park or orchard.26 While the etymology of 'hortus' the Latin word for garden also meant 'enclosure' and conjured up the notion of retirement, self-reliance and content away from the public world of politics. With boundaries, however, also came the possi bilities of transformation, exclusion and transgression.27 In the classical world priapus was the guardian deity of gardens and tension between the sensual and spiritual is a constant theme of gardens and their description. Justus Lipsius in his De constantia exclaims to his friend 'You have heavan here, Langius, and no garden', to which Langius replies with a diatribe against the collectors of 'strange herbs and flowers'.28 The commonplace of gardens as another Eden, alerts us to the way in which the study of gardens crosses over into more general considerations of evolving conceptions of nature.29 Antonio de Torquemada's philosophical and theological treatise Jardin de flores curiosas [Garden of curious flowers] (1570) invoked Aquinas' definition of nature as the representation of the 'voluntad y mente de Dios' [mind and will of God].30 Evelyn's particular formulation here of the relationship between God and nature, sets improving labour at the centre of man's purpose within the divine plan. John Parkinson's Paradisi in Sole (1629), alluded to above, exemplified the notion of the garden as a lost paradise. In his dedication to the queen, he prayed 'that your Highnesse may enioy the heauenly Paradise, after the many yeares fruition of this earthly'.31 Gregorio de los Rios argued that his treatise, despite the fact that, like Parkinson's, it dealt with flowers, was suitable even for monks and nuns: para religiosos es honesto y loable, cuando, después de cumplir con sus obliga ciones, ocupan la vista en aquella hermosura y variedad de flores y verduras; con 25 Kalendarium Hortense: Or, the Gardners Almanac (Printed by John Macock for John Martyn and John Allestry, 1664), sig.

An ordered and fruitful nature shaped by human ingenuity and art reflected early modern discourses of mastery and stewardship. LITERARY ARCADIAS Trends towards seeing landscapes instrumentally, for maximizing profit by better exploitation of the land through enclosure, drainage and disafforesta tion, were countered by literary trends that sought to re-enchant the natural world through romance or mythify the economic structure at the centre of the countryside, the country house.34 As nature was being transformed by the New Science into a 'governable utilitarian object', writers like Mary Wroth strove at 're-enchanting, or better, reinventing nature according to vitalist principles'.35 At the same time that new ways of exploiting the land were being employed, changes to the countryside, concerns about rural depopulation, the absence of sturdy yeoman to people armies for defence, or trees for ships, as Evelyn argued, underlined that sustainability was already an issue even in the seven teenth century. However, claims of scarcity as objective facts about the natural environment, whether of grain or timber, need to be treated cautiously as strategies to create value and manufacture control.36 For Watson, nostalgia for unmediated contact with the world of nature, efforts to identify with flora and fauna, an objective of seeing things in themselves, without recourse to proso popeia, anthropomorphism or personification, was a response to 'epistemo logical anxieties brought on by mediation', a crisis of representation and the 32 Gregorio de los Rios, Argicultura de Jardines, 19. 33 Robert Waston, Back to Nature: The Green and the Real in the Late Renaissance (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006), 6. 34 These themes were explored at a conference Land, Lanscape and Environment, 1500-1700, Early Modern Research Centre, University of Reading 2008, convened by Adam Smyth. 35 Sylvia Bowerbank, Speaking for Nature, 18. 36 Robert Waston, Back to Nature, 4.</page><page sequence="9">Gardens and horticulture in the Renaissance 'internal referentiality and historical instability of any verbal system'.37 Chorographies and the country house poem invested place with the mythic solidity of the age-old, ancient and unchanging, obscuring the true conditions behind nature's bountiful production of plenty. As Raymond Williams wrote more than three decades ago with characteris tic lucidity of Ben Jonson's country house poem for the Sidneys, 'To Pen shurst', their plenty was raised 'unlike others, "with no man's ruine, no mans grone"; with none, "that dwell about them" wishing them "downe" . . . [rather through] the gentle exercise of a power that was elsewhere, on their own evidence, mean and brutal'.38 The Edenic vision of natural plenty and order, linking Christian and classical myth, deliberately set out to exorcise the curse of the fall, guilt at consumption without labour. There is 'more than a hint... of that easy, insatiable exploitation of the land and its creatures - a prolonged delight in an organized and corporative production and consump tion - which is the basis of many early phases of intensive agriculture . . . this natural order is simply and decisively on its way to table'.39 This vision of providence is decisively linked by Jonson to human sharing and charity. The Arcadian ideal in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England was inexorably linked, whether as palimpsest or not, to changes in the early modern rural economy and impact of copyhold land tenure.40 There is an important differ ence between this leisured Arcadianism mediated through Virgil's Eclogues and the poetry of husbandry and agriculture inspired by Virgil's Georgics, Xenophon's Oeconomicus and Thomas Tusser. Agriculture was also, of course, at the centre of colonial enterprise, the plantation being at the centre of the civilizing processes of colonization. Gardens were always part of a 'wider cultural experience', more than simple reflections, they were 'cultural landscapes', 'sites where human beings dis cover and realize whole patterns of belief, authority, and social structure'.41 This is particularly true of the refraction of ftaliante models in English gardens, tracing an ambivalent cultural relationship of emulation and rejec tion. The generally accepted picture is one of a change away from the archi tectural settings of the Carolingian masque with avenues of trees, water features, topiary, arbours and grottoes, a rejection of formal parterres, staged effects, fountains and mythological Baroque statuary, towards variety and wilderness, blurring the boundaries between the formal garden and the wood land and agricultural land that surrounded it. This more 'natural' style of landscaping, however, became political in highly sophisticated and subtle 37 Ibid., 13 and 15. 38 Raymond Williams, The Country and the City (London: The Hogarth Press, 1985), 29. 39 Ibid., 30. 40 See Adam Nicholson, Earls of Paradise: England and the Dream of Perfection (London: Harper Press, 2008). 41 John Dixon Hunt, Garden and Grove: The Italian Renaissance Garden in the English Imagination 1600-1750 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996), xiii.</page><page sequence="10">10 Alexander Samson ways.42 Despite this, the English landscape garden 'owed much to a continuing emulation of Italian Renaissance models'.43 The simultaneous presence and absence of the Italianate garden is crucial to the aesthetic, moral and political understanding of English gardens from this period onwards. English visitors tended to elide historical differences and regional variations in Italian gardens, even the gardens of the Medici villas in Tuscany differed markedly from each other. Italianate gardens possessed important religious and political associations in the early modern English literary imagination. At the same time that the Earl of Leicester was creating the first Italianate, Renaisssance garden in 1575 at Kenilworth, Spencer's Guyon was destroying the 'Bower of Bliss': an exten sive garden populated by sweet-smelling flowers, scented herbs, the burbling of running water and fountain, erotic pictures 'of naked boyes', the melodious trilling of songbirds and a series of perspectives that required the spectator to read and interpret the scene and apply the moral.44 The rejection as opposed to sophisticated, knowing enjoyment of the 'Bower of Bliss' and by extension Italianate gardens by Spenser's Guyon, stems from their mythological, heathen schema and religious distaste with what they connoted. The classical, Ovidian gardens and landscapes alluded to in eulogizing the beauties of the 'bower' all signify death.45 The rejection of lascivious statuary, mythological themes and structures, topiary, lettering and heraldic symbolism, the falsity of image, sexual temptation and seduction through the senses and sensuality is part of a broader Protestant rejection of Roman Catholic aesthetics. It is not just that gardens of this type were Italianate but more specifically Roman and Florentine, with all the associations of immorality that came with it of sodomy, murder and corruption. The antitype of the 'Bower of Bliss', the 'Garden of Adonis', opposed Roman luxuriousness, decadence and immorality, nature as feigning simu lacrum, to the Venetian Republican's utilitarian virtue, exemplified by Tris sino, according to which nature is productive, pleasure and utility combined, garden, villa and farm interrelated, nature cultivated and improved rather than traduced with automata or suggestive erotic imagery.46 Venice was gen erally anti-papal, something that endeared it to Protestant observers, who were most likely to visit the Veneto, England's most significant trading area in Italy.47 Roman tyranny and oppression, its Baroque aesthetic of visual trickery and allusive, complex allegorical/mythological symbolism were anathema to 42 See Tim Richardson's The Arcadian Friends: Inventing the English Landscape (Bantam Press, 2007), 3-14. 43 Dixon Hunt, Garden and Grove, xvii. 44 This whole paragraph relies heavily on the brilliantly illuminating article by Michael Leslie, 'Spenser, Sidney, and the Renaissance Garden', English Literary Renaissance 22 (1992), 3-36.

Sidney had visited Prague in 1575 and then 1577 shortly after the accession of the ecu menical Rudolf II. Another house, Kalander's, as in Spenser provides a foil in Sidney's poem, with its 'well-arrayed ground', 'neither field, garden, nor orchard - or rather it was both field, garden and orchard . . . set with trees of the most taste-pleasing fruits . . . new beds of flowers, which being under the trees, the trees were to them a pavilion, and they to the trees, a mosaical floor'.48 It is curious that biblical imagery is almost totally absent from Renais sance gardens, despite the potentially rich theme of Christ as Gardener and providential understandings of nature.49 The Italian painter Federico Zuccaro had been invited to England by Leicester in the same year as the Kenilworth entertainment, having worked on frescoes in the Villa Farnese at Caprarola and Sala Regia in the Vatican, underlining that his garden was a self-conscious emulation of Italian models.50 The mercer and his servant Robert Langham described how the garden was 'beautified with many delectabl, fresh and umbragioous Boowerz, aberz, seatz, and walks, that with great art, cost, and diligens wear very pleazauntly appointed'.51 At the centre of the garden was a fountain where there wear things ye see, moought enflame ony mynde too long after looking: but whoo so was foound so hot in desyre, with the wreast of a Cok waz sure of a coolar: water spurting upward with such vehemency, az they shoold by and by be moystned from top too to.52 This amusing jape alerts us to the theatricality of gardens, the ways they employed humour and jokes as part of how they were to be experienced, controlling perspectives and their own interpretation, like the terraces con structed to give particular prospects over the garden and surrounding park land and also link house and garden. Water jokes were common in Italian gardens such as the Villa Medici in Castello and Villa Lante at Bagnaia, and known as 'burladores' or tricksters in Spanish.53 Elizabeth I commissioned a fountain for Hampton Court, finished in 1590, that included a giochi d'acqua sometimes catching bystanders unawares with water spurting out of marble 48 Philip Sidney, The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia (The New Arcadia), ed.

FASHION FOR FLOWERS Concerns with profit and pleasure, art and nature, authority and authorship link gardens, garden writing and poesie with changing concepts of land and landscape. Evolving notions of private property and ownership read estates as not solely available for economic exploitation and personal pleasure. Their improvement, as for Evelyn, was a patriotic imperative, improving and strengthening the kingdom and its natural resources while being simulta neously morally beneficial to those involved in such a project. Labour and its moral benefits accrued not just to the great retired soldiers and statesmen of the age as they celebrated their achievements, but for everyone down to the humble huswife. Gardens were notjust other Edens, their cultivation was a way back to the prelapsarian world for those who cultivated them. Pruning to control nature's wanton excess and reign in the sprouting of wild vegetation symbolized the constant need to police sexual desire.55 As horticultural trea tises proliferated, cuttings, splicing, transplanting and grafting became loaded with metaphorical resonances of the relationship between art and nature, art's ability to improve on nature, metaphors further extended to explore the nature of poetic ornament and rhetorical artifice. Sexual reproduction and the life of plants became intertwined in a shared language by which new hybrids, bastard scions or offshoots, new growths grafted onto old rootstock and dynasty or familial hierarchies were envisaged through hortulan lan guage. One metaphor eliding the boundaries between body, landscape and natural world figured mining as an abortion. Family trees and genealogies proliferated at the same time as chorographies invented a new language with which to celebrate landscape and the sites of historical memory. The distinc tions between gardens and landscapes specifically shaped for leisure, land scape architects as opposed to mere gardeners, emerged or were blurred while the purpose and understanding of gardens, for utility or pleasure, art or science evolved. There is no doubt that gardens were 'ideologically charged spaces' that conveyed 'social meaning', particularly as sites where gender power relations and those between men and women and the natural world were shaped, negotiated and formulated.56 Changing fashions in flowers reflected the way in which gardening encoded ongoing reaffirmations of social difference; as gillyflowers and carnations proliferated and became 54 See Paula Henderson's article in this issue, note 40. 55 Rebecca Bushneil, Green Desire: Imagining Early Modern English Gardens (London: Cornell University Press, 2003) 96. 56 See Jennifer Munroe, Gender and the Garden in Early Modern English Literature (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008).</page><page sequence="13">Gardens and horticulture in the Renaissance 13 accessible to people lower down the social scale, tulips and auriculas became fashionable among the upper classes. A 'preoccupation with novelty, rarity and hybridization',57 led to the importation of exotic, tropical delicates kept alive in heated greenhouses. The first tulip had of course been brought back by the Habsburg embassy to Suleiman the Magnificent's court in Constantinople in 1555, allegedly by the Flemish ambassador Busbecq. They were seen in Augsburg gardens by the naturalist Conrad Gesner, including that of the Fuggers a few years later.58 Lope de Vega in the dedicatory letter to his play Lucinda perseguida [Lucinda pursued] addressed to the Flemish Emmanuel Sueyro, thanked his friend for some tulips he had sent for the poet's garden of 'varios colores, hermosa y peregrina vista' [various colours, beautiful and rarely seen] ,59 Frustrated social ambition cast a shadow over Lope's brilliant career. In Justus Lipsius' neo Stoic dialogue, aspiradonal fashions in flowers were denounced: 'that sect ... who . . . hunt after strange herbs and flowers, which having got, they pre serve and cherish more carefully than any mother does her child; these are men whose letters fly abroad into Thracia, Greece, and India only for a little root or seed', whereas gardens 'were ordained for modest recreation, not for vanity; for solace and not for sloth', the 'true end and use of gardens, to wit, quietness, withdrawing from the world, meditation, reading, writing'.60 Francis Bacon in his essay 'Of Gardens' dismissed medieval 'knots . . . under the windows of the house on that side which the garden stands, they be but toys: you may see as good sights many times in tarts', along with topiary ('I, for my part, do not like images cut out in juniper or other garden stuff; they be for children') and statuary - 'great princes' 'sometimes add statua's, and such things, for state and magnificence, but nothing to the true pleasure of a garden.'61 The more formal and splendid gardens concerned with display and magnificence were tainted and tarnished by their hollowing out of nature. While there may have been a desire to see things in themselves, related to the empirical and scientific interest of gardens, the personification of nature, anthropomorphism and prosopopeia ran riot in the early modern garden, compensating for nature's disenchantment. Comparisons of teaching to gar dening were commonplace in humanist educational treatises, as were meta phors likening books to gardens.62 Gardens were a symbol of self-fashioning and the ability of art to improve on nature. Baltasar Graciân wrote that art: 57 See Susan C.

Suple de ordinario los descuidos de la naturaleza, perfeccionan dola en todo; que sin este socorro del artificio quedara inculta y grosera' [a complement of nature and a second being that greatly beautifies it... It makes up for nature's defects, perfecting in every way; without this aid from artifice it would be coarse and uncultivated].63 Iago's extended conceit to Rodrigo in Othello rejects the idea that it is not in his power to bend his will away from temptation: our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners, so that if we will plant nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop, and weed up thyme; supply it with one gender of herbs, or distract it with industry, why, the power, and corrigible authority of this, lies in our wills.64 From the Muses' garden or Apollo's garden, the garden came to symbolize art, creative power, the shaping and improvement of nature, a metaphor for humanity's divine nature and ability to impose spirit and reason on matter, disorder and chaos. Numerous similes compared gardening to poetry. George Puttenham for example argued that when the poet 'speaks figuratively ... he doth as the cunning gardiner that vsing nature as coadiutator, furders her conclusions &amp; many times makes her effectes more absolute and straunge.'65 Poetic ornament like gardening worked with nature, to embellish and improve on her through art. Collections of romances, the indigenous Castilian metre dating back to the medieval period, were frequently titled with the names of plant-life: from Juan de Timoneda's Rosas [Roses] (1573) to various 'silvas de romances' [forests of romances] (Barcelona 1561, Zaragoza 1588) and of course Pedro de Mexfa famous prose miscellany Silva de varia lecciôn, 'ramillete' [posy] and simply 'flores' [flowers].66 As Susan Staub points out in this issue the term anthology derives from the Greek for flower collection, like its Latin synonym 'florilegium' which means flower culling. There was a fundamental ambiguity in relation to the garden as a space of intimate retire ment, female leisure and pleasure and as an extension of the public space of the household. The pleasure or walled garden was specifically created as a female space. Fertility and the well-ordered household were reflected by it. Although it also had a negative opposite, a dark other as a sexual space, of 63 Baltasar Graciân, Obras Complétas, ed.

Gardens, women and poetry had long been associated in the early modern period, the poetic bower being the clichéd place of choice for literary and perhaps real amorous encounters. The first literary garden of early modern Spain is Melibea's 'huerto' or 'huerta', garden or orchard, the walled space created for her pleasure into which Calisto trespasses and first speaks to her, where their relationship will be graphically consummated and from whose walls her lover will fall symbolically to his death before she commits suicide throwing herself from a tower into the same place.67 While the country could be read providentially in terms of morally improving labour, in contrast to the city's moral confusions, it could equally be seen as a space of sexual freedom, a liberation from stifling bureau cratic norms of the emergent modern state. Lope de Vega's play El villano en su rincôn [The Peasant in his Niche\ based on an apocryphal story of Francis I becoming lost while out hunting and spending the night in a woodcutter's hut, explores the confrontation between king and unrepentant old peasant, who wishes to avoid at any cost meeting the royal gaze that bound the subject through awe to a semi-divine majesty and brought the individual into being in a political sense, providing a model for emulation, and a mirror where a morally exemplary human being is reflected. While, for the king it is a philo sophical awakening to the truth of his own condition, through confronting his own self, divested of the trappings of majesty and royal business, a desengaho and self-awareness crucial in his development as king, for the peasant the plot's denouement with his installation as chamberlain at court, is a deeply ambivalent 'elevation'.68 AMERICAN IMPORTS Perhaps the final, important stimuli behind horticultural and garden writing in the early modern period were the challenges of the Americas.69 New introductions quickly spread across western Europe. Floral treasures intro duced through Spain included the African marigold, the Marvel of Peru, and 67 Fernando de Rojas, La Celestina: Tragicomedia de Cailsto y Melibea, ed. Francisco Lobera et al.

By the end of the sixteenth century, it was clear that American nature had overrun the descriptive possibilities of traditional interpretative schemes and detailed descriptive studies were required, a need fulfilled by José de Acosta's Historia natural y moral de las Indias (1590) [Natural and Moral History of the Indies\ ,72 Despite its date and wealth of information, the Suma de geographia (1519) [Geographical Summary] of Martin Fernandez de Enciso remained on the margins of the introduction of botanical knowledge, despite a translation of the section on America into English in 1578, which probably circulated mostly amongst cosmographers and 'pilotos'.73 The most important early texts were De la natural historia de las Indias (1526) [Natural History of the Indies] and Historia general y natural de las Indias (1535) [General and Natural History of the Indies] by Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo. It is notable that it is American nature that is central to the historic importance of these early accounts. Later, Francisco Lopez de Gomara brought together material from Angleria and Oviedo in Historia de las Indias (1552) [History of the Indies]. This account was translated into English by Thomas Nicholas (1578 and 1596), who also ren dered the Historia del descubrimiento y conquista del Peru (1555) [History of the Discovery and Conquest of Peru] by Agustfn de Zârate into the vernacular in 1581. The same translator also published Nuevas... del gran Reino de China [News . . .from the Great Kingdom of China] in 1577.74 Perhaps the most important text in the dissemination of knowledge about American plants was Nicolas Monardes' Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales (three parts apperaed between 1565-74) [Medicinal History of Things Brought Back from our West Indies], Monardes was translated by Frampton in 1577, reissued in the same year and then in aug mented editions in 1580 and 1596.75 Hariot's A briefe and true report refers the reader back to this translation, The ioyfull newes from the West Indies. Gerard's The Herball (1597) derived much of its information on American plants from Dodoens, who in turn was heavily influenced by Monardes.76 In the story of 70 John H.

He visited Spain as the preceptor of Jacob Fugger, whose family were early cultivators of the tulip, arriving in Vitoria in mid-1564 and staying in Seville around January 1565 before returning to Madrid in April. He maintained a correspondence with the Seville-based naturalist Simon de Tovar who died in the city 1596. Clusius of course produced an annotated translation of Monardes in 1574 printed by Plantin, getting hold of copies in London in 1571, only a few months after they were published in Seville, as well as producing his own account of Iberian flora, Rariorum aliquot stirpium per Hispanias observatarum historia (1576).78 In these texts, a metaphorical language was born around plants to think about the relationship between the Old World and the New, through notions of geographical distribution, of a natural sympathy between climate and type, exoticism, transplanting and hybridity.79 These ideas associated particular plants with national types and the natural philosophy that linked climate and character. LOCUS AMOENUS AND GARDEN HISTORY The academic study of gardens is a relatively recent phenomenon. According to Roy Strong,80 garden history took off 'as a serious academic industry' in 1979 following the exhibition at the Victoria and Albert museum entitled The Garden,81 Paula Henderson discussed the sources on gardens in England in her book on The Tudor House and Garden - from the great surveys of Willian Camden and John Norden, to foreign visitors' accounts, as well as, of course, books on gardening and husbandry and estate maps. Many of these accounts make frustrating assumptions about the visual evidence in front of them, the way that Renaissance gardens actually looked are difficult to reconstruct, caught between plans, general structural descriptions and the more detailed scientific attention to specific plants. Surviving verbal accounts by travellers or participants in outdoor festivities, in addition to visual evidence in engravings, paintings, gardening manuals and so on, supplemented by archaeological evidence for the structure, architecture and layout of groundworks allow us to go some way towards reconstructing them. However, gardens never remain 77 See Brent Elliot's article in this volume. 78 Pinero and Terrada, La influencia espanola, 67 and 89-90. 79 See Londa Schiebinger and Claudia Swan (eds.), Colonial Botany: Science, Commerce and Politics in the Early Modern World (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006), esp.

The most difficult thing to recover are planting schemes, although looking at the plants imported for big, lavish princely gardens may give us some idea of when flowers, herbs or trees took root in particular countries' gardens. Any inves tigation of these green spaces runs into the problem that gardens are con stantly in flux and change, alive and never the same, sprouting beyond and breaching the limits of wall, fence, bed and frame that separate them from nature and attempt to contain them apart from the landscape that surrounds them. Roy Strong noted in the preface to his 1997 reissue of The Renaissance Garden in England82 that the one avenue through which massive advances have been made in our understanding of this subject has been garden archaeology. The essays in this volume seek to contribute to and expand on debates about gardens and environmental thought in the early modern period in areas from botany and art history to gender studies, literature and archaeol ogy. Brent Elliott's essay confronts and draws our attention to the ways in which the technology of the book itself affected the spread of botanical knowledge, with pirated illustrations slowly more worn eventually become all but unrecognizable; the dependence of the herbal on tradition and authority and the ways this dependence influenced the development of new classifica tory schemes and the prestige of particular examples of this early modern genre. The first systematic attempt to respond to the attack on the medieval herbal (treatises on medicinal plants) that had begun in 1492 with a text pointing out the confusions, discrepancies and misidentifications within clas sical sources (in particular Pliny and Dioscorides) was the Herbarum vivae eicones (1551) by Otto Brunfels, a Basel-based physician. Plants introduced from the Americas gave impetus to the concept of geographical distribution and certain environments being suitable for particular flora. Leonhart Fuchs's De historia stirpium (1542) described American introductions like maize and was possibly the first herbal based on observation rather than imitation. Maize had of course been brought back from the Carribean by Columbus on his third voyage, the first illustration of it appearing in Fernandez de Oviedo. Paula Henderson author of the seminal The Tudor House and Garden83 considers here the issue of whether the English garden had a 'Renaissance' at all, looking at the patchy evidence from estate maps for the survival of medi eval features from galleries to banqueting houses, earthworks and snail mounts to moats well into the sixteenth century; in the same way that earlier gothic and chivalric forms continued to haunt the architecture, visual art and literary imagination of the Tudor and Stuart period. William Lawson's A New Orchard and Garden of 1618 demonstrates the availability of Italian Renaissance 82 Strong, The Renaissance Garden in England, 6. 83 Paula Henderson, The Tudor House and Garden: Architecture and Landscape in the Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries (London: Yale University Press, 2005).

Nevertheless, the water garden continued to be popular, chiming with the popularity of the ornamental canal in the Low Countries, often also a functional feature providing drainage on the flat flood plains and the French enclosure of pleasure gardens and houses within moats and canals. Understanding the mutually influencing factors producing English gardens in this period, the movement between past and present, indigenous and foreign, as an evolution reinforces the prejudices of later architectural historians and obscures the eclecdc and heterogeneous confluence of culture, politics, geog raphy and religion producing the landscapes and topography of Tudor England. A shift in emphasis from heraldic to classical motifs on the indig enous table fountains of John Harington and Lord Lumley is one of the fragmentary pieces of evidence to betray the influence of Italian Renaissance imagery. The English Heritage reconstruction of the fountain at Kenilworth is also discussed. Pyramids and obelisks, free-standing statuary all cropped up with greater frequency towards the end of the sixteenth century. Nevertheless, in Jacobean England it seems that fantastic or romantic medievalism made a return that foreshadowed the political revival of the gothic in the eighteenth century, both resurrections were intertwined with patriotic fervour. Garden history is complicated by its non-linear phases and evolution, the difficulties of tracing influence even when enough evidence survives for us to gain a rough approximation of what a garden actually looked like. Some of the best surviving evidence of the complexity of mapping gardens onto broader art historical categories are the Giusto Utens lunettes of Medici villas from around 1599-1602 (Fig. 1). The Cafaggiolo garden from the mid fifteenth century (panel d) typifies an ideal of rural retreat, a productive, enclosed, agricultural style that persists into the seventeenth century and was mirrored at Collesalvetti (panel a). By contrast the Tuscan Villa La Petraia of 1575 (panel c) is more self-consciously architectural, with house and garden drawn together on one scale, also found in the mannerist dell'Ambrogiana depicted as it was at the end of the sixteenth century (panel b) still probably in the process of being rebuilt. Claudia Lazzaro explores the political and cultural uses of colossal statues of ancient river gods unearthed in Rome in the early sixteenth century, which soon found their way into papal and then, through imitations, later Medici gardens. Their settings, mounted on trays with rippling or trickling water against natural backdrops, blurred distinctions between art and nature, and eventually led to their use in fountains with water incorporated into the figure's design. These anthropomorphic figures were also used in entries and gardens as assertions of territorial lordship, symbolizing the relationship between the fertility of a given state and its rulers. The age of a river could be symbolized by the figure's youth; its having changed course through the crossing of its legs; and a male-gendered natural abundance through water spurting from its penis.</page><page sequence="20">20 Alexander Samson (d) Figs, la-d Giusto Utens, Villa Collesalvetti, Villa dell'Ambrogiana, Villa La Petraia, Villa Cafaggiolo, from a series of lunettes depicting views of the Medici villas, c. 1599-1602, tempera on panel, Florence, Museo di Firenze com'era Some were given new identities like that transformed into the Arno, complete with Medici symbolism carved around the rim of the vase it was holding. Stylistically it echoed the work of Michelangelo and came to adorn the sculp ture garden of the Florentine Medici Pope Leo X. If nature was holy, a mask for the creator, then the personification of river gods reflected the evolving ways in which this sacredness was imagined in political, artistic, gendered and cultural terms. From ideas about natural science to good lorship in flood defences and acqueducts, the river god was a gauge of evolving relationships between the natural world, its artistic representations, its stewards and their territories, mankind's place in the changing geographies of their environment. This was a landscape shaped above all by Medici patronage, the artistic genius of Mich elangelo and the centrality of the city of Florence. Susan Staub's subject in this volume, George Gascoigne, had been involved by Leicester in composing the Kenilworth entertainments and commemo rated them in his The Princelye Pleasures at the Courte at Kenelwoorth (1576). He had appeared as a savage man dressed in ivy. As well as his The Noble Arte of Venerie or Hunting, a translation of 1575 of works on hunting by Jacques du Fouilloux and Gaston de Foix, he had also unsuccessfully tried his hand at farming, leasing the manor at Willington in Bedfordshire in 1562. There is a reconfiguration of authorship between the first and second editions of Gas coigne's poetry, from that in A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres of an anonymous editor of a coterie volume circulated in manuscript, bringing together a</page><page sequence="21">Gardens and horticulture in the Renaissance 21 bunch of disparate blooms, to that in The Posies of George Gascoigne where a controlling and directing authorial voice already announced on the title page categorizes the plants in order to direct his readers' interpretation and under standing of them. Poetic collections and gardening manuals betray similar social aspirations. This essay explores the meaning of gardens in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, through the conversation between garden rheto ric, a burgeoning discourse of horticulture, in gardening manuals and herbals, and other forms of writing. Gascoigne's purpose, like that of garden writers, was to uncover for readers a privileged and cultivated private world, and appeal to their 'green desire'84 to become involved with the making of England as hallowed, fertile and profitable ground, the result of morally improving labour. The issue as to whether gardens were more properly the domain of men or women in this period is explored in this volume in Jennifer Munroe's consid eration of Mary Somerset (1630-1715), Duchess of Beaufort, whose 'innocent diversions' on her estate in Badminton, centred on collecting, categorizing and analysing plants. These 'innocent diversions' blurred the line between gardening, horticulture and botany. Far from displaying deference to the male scientific establishment, she was part of an inner circle of natural scien tists working on plant classification, cataloguing and description. Her exten sive correspondence with Sir Hans Sloane, botanist and long-time president of the Royal Society underlines the scientific value of her investigations and classifications of plants, which were compiled in a twelve-volume manuscript, the Herbarium. She was sent copies by Sloane of his printed works and those of another botanist, John Ray, who was lent Sloane's copy of her manuscript and made copious annotations on it. Without the monumentalization of a print edition, however, Mary Somerset's labours were as ephemeral as the garden she dedicated her life to. Despite the fact that her contemporaries clearly took her seriously, her reputation has wilted and been forgotten. My contribution to the volume departs from a consideration of the Spanish lexis for outdoor spaces, arguing that climatic conditions played a crucial role in shaping the invocation and imagination of gardens in early modern Spain. The climate affected the boundaries between public and private spaces in the baking plains of Castile, with shade and water - which were dominant features of literary evocations of the natural world - found most frequently on river banks. The word 'jardin' did not enter common usage until the eighteenth century, rather huerto/a, an outdoor space for leisure or recreation defined by trees for shade and running water, a stream or river to cool and freshen the air. The permeable borders of the huerto/a reflected the ambivalent meanings 84 Phrase taken from the title of Rebecca Bushnell's Green Desire: Imagining Early Modern English Gardens (London: Cornell University Press, 2003).</page><page sequence="22">22 Alexander Samson of gardens by the end of the seventeenth century as spaces of danger and temptation as well as spiritual contemplation, places of moral and mortal effects. The newest critical tool for understanding gardens in the past is repre sented in this volume by Brian Dix, whose chapter looks at the uses of garden archaeology and how much what lies beneath the contours of great gardens can tell us about what was originally there and serve as a critical tool in carrying out sensitive reconstructions, such as those in recent years at Kenil worth and Vaux-le Vicomte.85 He points to the inherent limitations of relying on any single source of evidence and that this tool is at its most powerful where archaeology can be combined with several other generically different ones. There is a certain irony about what the archaeological evidence tells us about Kenilworth. The reconstruction is a monument to a kind of solidity and permanence that the original garden clearly did not possess, its imperma nence and ephemerality suggesting it was erected just for the duration of the queen's stay. Only thirty years later, little remained, the obelisks mentioned in Langham's description of the entertainments, probably wood painted to look like stone, unmentioned. The planting at the manor of Sir Thomas Tresham at Lyveden may have paid tribute to his Catholicism with willows around the moat canals and roses and raspberries, associated with Christ's passion appar ent in the circular beds emanating out from the central Edenic orchard. The profusion of recent writing on nature is finally beginning to reflect its own wild abundance, sprouting up everywhere, endlessly fertile and only with difficulty controlled by pruning, weeding and digging over.86 The material in this volume is inevitably selective encompassing only certain aspects of the early modern garden, but nevertheless we have been lucky enough to attract writing from scholars of garden history, botany, archaeology, art history, gender and early modern natures. The arrival of ecocriticism, championed by among others Jonathan Bate, might have been expected to have given new impetus to the consideration of landscape, horticulture and figurations of the natural world in this period.87 Ecocriticism - nature not just a projection of human values, an irreducible nature beyond anthropomorphism, prosopo peia, and personification - and a recovery of early modern 'nature' is under way.88 Recent critics have demonstrated that early modern writers were aware 85 English Heritage have attempted to reconstruct at Kenilworth the paradise garden built by Leicester for the festivities with which Elizabeth I's visit in 1575 was feted; described by Robert Laneham, a mercer in Robert Dudley's court, see Robert Langham, A Letter, ed. R. J. P. Kuin (Leiden: Brill, 1983) and on the reconstruction John Watkins (ed.), forthcoming book. 86 An 'Early Modern Gardens in Context Research Network' has been set up at Trinity College Dublin co-ordinated by Anatole Tchikine, based in their Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. 87 A good recent survey of these approaches is Thomas Hallock, Ivo Kamps and Karen Raber (eds.), Early Modern Ecostudies: From the Florentine Codex to Shakespeare (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008).

However, it is clear that '[e]nvironmental criticism in literature and the arts clearly does not yet have the standing within the academy of such other issue-driven discourses as those of race, gender, sexuality, class and globalization.'89 Ecocriticism initially sought to bring literary studies closer to life sciences in a way that underlined the disjunction between the natural and human. A turn away from this cri tique of discourses of nature and the natural and the employment of organi cist models saw the questioning of distinctions between natural and human environments. From controversies about the historical reconstruction of early modern gardens and their fake fruit, to the political and aesthetic implications of plants, gardens, statuary and landscape, it is clear that the locus amoenus is still very much central to the study of the Renaissance. 89 Lawrence Buell, The Future of Environmental Criticism: Environmental Crisis and Literary Imagination (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), 129.</page></plain_text>
