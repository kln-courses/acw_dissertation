BEVERLEY tf We can see, then, that metaphor occurs at the precise point at which sense comes out of non-sense, that is, at that frontier which, as Freud discovered, when crossed the other way produces what we generally call 'wit' (Witz); it is at this frontier that man tempts his very destiny when he derides the signifier. Jacques Lacan At the center of literary attacks on the Soledades has always been the question of the relation of G6ngora's hyperbolic formal mannerism with a possible signification; thus, for example, Cascales' celebrated opinion that the poem represented a poetic Babel "volviendo a su primer caos las cosas." 1 In an exchange in the late seventeenth century on the Soledades, the Portugese critic Faria y Sousa accused G6ngora of failing to display what he termed a "misterio scien- tifico." Echoing the topic of Cascales and the earlier detractors, including Lope or his cohorts in the " Carta de amigo," he main- tained that the poet " era invencible en las burlas, porque essas no constavan de ciencia, sino de ingenio, y genio para ellas." The Peruvian Gongorist, Espinosa Medrano, replied to the effect that it was not the business of poetic discourse to constitute a science or to align itself with any existing corpus of natural doctrine.2 As Andree Collard has shown in her recent study, Espinosa Medrano's position anticipated the incorporation of the Soledades into Euro- pean literature as an exemplar of " pure " poetry, and the formalism of the Generation of '27 critics, notably Damaso Alonso. She argues that the distinction between " ciencia" and " ingenio " constitutes an effective definition of G6ngora's new poetics: i.e., that it breaks 1 Francisco Cascales, Cartas filol6gicas (Madrid: Clasicos Castellanos, 1959), II, p. 188. 2 Faria y Sousa's remarks and the reply are both in Juan de Espinosa Medrano, Apologetica en favor de Don Luis de G6ngora, ed Ventura Garcia Calder6n, Revue Hispanique, LXV (1925).</page><page sequence="2">234 M L N with the traditionalist poetic of an " arte docente," challenges with "erudici6n peregrina" the doctrinal authority of theology over literature, celebrates linguistic and formal complication for its own sake.3 I would like to suggest that this kind of distinction may be overdrawn, that the formation of language and image in G6ngora's poetry itself presupposes a kind of " misterio scientifico," an attempt in an expanded and technified linguistic structure to absorb and materialize the new phenomenology and psychology which had else- where emerged out of the Renaissance sciences. To this end, I want to undertake here an analysis of the opening sequence (verses 1-61) of the Soledad primera. Despite the Arcadian thematics of the Soledad primera, G6ngora was not the poet of the inland bucolic locus amoenus like Garcilaso or San Juan. There is in his poetry a constant attraction to the sea; more accurately, he tends to explore over and over again the bound- ary between land and water, to compose the shoreline as a language spectacle. Now the appeal of a shoreline landscape in Spanish late Renaissance poetry is a double one. On the one hand, it permits the activation of the rich material of the sea and navigation, as in Herrera or Carrillo. On a conceptual plane, it also provides a setting in which the poet is free to construct metaphorically a dialectical interplay of the four elements-Earth, Air, Fire, Water. In such a shoreline setting, which manifests the cyclical generation and regen- eration of Nature, man and his artifacts appear as teleological accident; it forms for the poet a kind of mobile theater for the brief human pathos it contains. (Thus the old fisherman in the Soledad segunda speaks of his island lookout as a " teatro de Fortuna.") Throughout the history of G6ngora's poetry, the elements of this shoreline setting re-appear as an obsessive fixation, to borrow a term from psychoanalytic jargon, an Urszene somehow at the heart of his poetic strategy. They are already evident in the lyric romances which G6ngora cultivated as part of his apprenticeship some thirty years before the composition of the Soledades: En el caudaloso rio donde el muro de mi patria se mira la gran corona y el antiguo pie se lava, 8 Nueva poesia: conceptismo, culteramismo en la critica espafola (Madrid: Castalia, 1967), p. 102.</page><page sequence="3">M L N 235 desde su barca Alci6n suspiros y redes lanza, los suspiros por el cielo y las redes por el agua. (Mille #5) In the Polifemo, the intricate elaboration of Ovid's tale is enclosed within an initial description of the shoreline of Sicily below Etna and its reappearance as the "escollo fatal" with which the giant crushes Acis. The ocean is both the genesis and the destiny of the hero: from ". . . el mar siciliano / el pie argenta de plata al Lilibeo" to "corriente plata al fin sus blancos huesos." The Soledades are likewise framed by this shoreline Urszene. It appears in the opening sequence as the context of the shipwreck of G6ngora's hero, at the beginning of the Soledad segunda as a prelude to the piscatory themes developed there, and as the landscape of the indefinite ending of the poem. This setting, the " incierta ribera" of the Soledades, is at once a concrete landscape in Nature and a virtual landscape of the mind, saturated by mythic allusions which compose an epico-lyrical " stage" on which G6ngora's multiple persona-the pilgrim-plays out his role as protagonist of the representation, actor of the teleonomic operations of language in the poem. It is a landscape in which the elements are given as " confused," the initial dimension of the "soledad confusa" (of language, of Nature, of soul) in the dedicatory proposition: Pasos de un peregrino son errante cuantos me dict6 versos dulce musa: en soledad confusa perdidos unos, otros inspirados. The description of the Urszene occupies the first sixty-one lines of the Soledad primera, the sequence I have chosen to analyze here. With the appearance of the " mal distinta lumbre " in verse 58, the pilgrim leaves the shore and proceeds inland towards the goatherds' albergue. D6imaso Alonso in his edition of the poem divided this section into seven major syntactic periods: verses 1-14 (the ship- wreck), 15-21 (rescue on the wooden plank), 22-28 (surf and shore- line), 29-33 (arrival on land), 34-41 (ritual drying of clothes), 42-51 (ascension of the shore cliff), and 52-61 (appearance of the light inland). For the sake of convenience, I will follow this arrange-</page><page sequence="4">236 M L N ment section by section since it is used in most modern texts of the Soledades.4 1. Era del anio la estaci6n florida en que el mentido robador de Europa -media luna las armas de su frente, y el Sol todos los rayos de su pelo-, luciente honor del cielo, en campos de zafiro pace estrellas; cuando el que ministrar podia la copa a Jupiter mejor que el garz6n de Ida, -naufrago y desdefiado, sobre ausente- lagrimosas de amor dulces querellas da al mar; que condolido, fue a las ondas, fue al viento el misero gemido, segundo de Ari6n dulce instrumento. The opening unit of the Urszene series, verses 1-14, is broken into two sections by the semicolon at the end of verse 6. The first of these presents an image of cosmological light against the blue of an afternoon sky (" campos de zafiro "); the second, an image of the surface of the Ocean. The celebrated invocation of the constellation of Taurus which opens the poem defines its initial seasonal mode as Spring, the rebirth of Nature. G6ngora's astrological lore leads to the equation of Spring, Sun and Bull (as sexual energy); in Spring the Sun is supposed to enter the planetary house or sign of Taurus, hence "y el Sol todos los rayos de su pelo." The Sun/Bull is then "horned" by the Moon: "media luna las armas de su frente." (This is a descriptive ellipsis of the late afternoon setting of the opening when Sun and Moon would be simultaneously visible in the sky.) As cosmological light, the image manifests the primary element of Fire combined with the anthropomorphic form of the Bull as the metamorphosis (" mentido robador ") under which Jupiter abducts and rapes Europa. The complex involves a series of opposing terms and categories which will continue in operation throughout the Soledad primera: masculine (Jupiter) / feminine 'But G6ngora's intention was to present the text as a single unbroken silva encompassing the length of each Soledad, thus identifying the "confusion" of the poetic form with the "soledad confusa " of the pilgrim. See Maurice Molho, Sdmantique et Poetique:. a propos des Solitudes de G6ngora (Bordeaux: Ducros, 1969), p. 37, n. 6.</page><page sequence="5">M L N 237 (Europa), mythic or divine entity / human protagonist, Nature (the Bull) / Culture (Jupiter as anthropomorphic deity). The rape of Europa involves sequentially, in Ovid's collation of classical mythology, the pilgrimage of her brother Cadmus to rescue her, a pilgrimage which will terminate through the Theban cycle in the foundation of the City, that is, in a transformation from state of Nature to state of Culture. The binary sexual antagonism of Jupiter and Europa, expressed in the violence of the rape, will be resolved on the level of human protagonists by the " yoke " of the wedding ceremony which ends the Soledad primera. Cadmus is thus implicit in the initial complex as the archetype of human love (here the " equal " fraternal love of brother and sister). In his character as a pilgrim in search of reunion with the feminine principle, he models G6ngora's abstract persona, the " peregrino." The function of the semicolon after the pastoral image of the Bull (" en campos de zafiro pace estrellas ") is to halt the periphrastic complex and introduce in antithesis the piscatory scene of the ship- wreck and the figure of the pilgrim. The shift involves a spatial opposition of ascensional and descensional perspective: Europa as she is carried up into the heavens from the shoreline, the pilgrim (" Cadmus ") now appearing in the Ocean. As in the desastre of Byzantine romance which may be G6ngora's model here, the ship- wreck as a narrative topos connotes the idea of a fall from plenitude; hence the adjectives which modify the form of his appearance: "-naufrago y desdefiado, sobre ausente-." The direct allusion to Ganymede complements the tacit model of Cadmus. Ganymede is the archetype (human) of adolescent male beauty, the ideal type of male homosexual love. The allusion, then, inverts the Jupiter/ Europa relation which opens the action: Europa is the female human object of Jupiter's (" animal "/divine) love, Ganymede the male. To abduct Europa, the god takes the form of the Bull (animal of the Earth), to seduce Ganymede the form of the Eagle (animal of the Air). Like Cadmus-Ganymede, the pilgrim carries within him a division, a separation of sexual or fraternal unity into opposing or perverted terms. Jupiter as Bull is the figure of a mature man, the Father/procreator, while Cadmus/Ganymede is adolescent male con- sciousness which has been violated, which has fallen from innocence. (The pilgrim is " garz6n," " mancebo," " inconsiderado peregrino," "extranjero," etc.) The tears and cries of the pilgrim conjoin his</page><page sequence="6">238 M L N (psychic) disaster, the shipwreck, with the natural harmonics of Water and Air. Now, in the code of classical myth which G6ngora draws on, the Ocean would be anthropomorphized as Venus, the "absent" Woman, providential reconciler of sentimental disaster. The implicit logic is that Nature (as Venus), moved by his plight (" condolido "), operates to set up the means of rescue which appear in the next unit. The " misero gemido " is thus " segundo de Ari6n dulce instrumento," as Arion, another version of the pilgrim exile, is said to have saved himself from drowning after being thrown over- board during a storm by playing his lyre. (Arion is the model of the psychic power of the " lyric " poet in a piscatory context as Orpheus is in a pastoral one.) Taken together, the next two syntactic periods of the series, verses 15-21 and 22-28, are isomorphic with the first period of fourteen verses; the former is broken into two semi-periods at verse 6; the latter form two independent sentences of six and seven verses respectively. 2. Del siempre en la montafia opuesto pino al enemigo Noto piadoso miembro roto -breve tabla-delfin no fue pequeiio al inconsiderado peregrino que a una Libia de ondas su camino fi6, y su vida a un lenio. Whereas the syntactic break in the first period contained an implicit opposition of the elements of Fire (Moon, Sun as male Jupiter) and Water (Ocean as female Venus), this begins with an immediate and graphic image of the interaction of Earth and Air: the pine tree opposed to the storm wind (" enemigo Noto "). The period develops around a typically Gongorist amphibology. We can read here that either a piece of wood broken off the " opuesto pino " by the storm wind, or a " tabla "-wood fashioned into a plank which is torn loose from the wreckage of the ship-, becomes a " dolphin " or vehicle of rescue for the drowning pilgrim. In either case, this "piadoso miembro roto " enters as the effect of the earlier sympathetic Nature (" fue a las ondas, fue al viento ") which turns from its wild and destructive force (the Bull, the storm) to aid the pilgrim providentially (Venus). The "delfin no fue pequefio," apparently totally epiphonemic, is a logical extension of the identifi-</page><page sequence="7">M L N 239 cation of the pilgrim and Arion. The whole amphibology is built around a series of coded oppositions between its connotative ele- ments: " pino " and "montafia" opposed to " enemigo Noto "; pine as wood in Nature / " tabla" as wood fabricated in the " lefio," a conventional synecdoche for ship; wood as inanimate natural object / the dolphin as animate. The terminal " una Libia de ondas su camino" complements the initial Earth-Air opposition with a conceit of reversible Nature built on the identity of the desert (as extreme of dehydration) and the waves (as excess of Water) as dimensions of danger for the " inconsiderado peregrino" who has dared to venture away from his origin. 3. Del oceano pues antes sorbido, y luego vomitado no lejos de un escollo coronado de secos juncos, de calientes plumas, -alga todo y espumas- hallo hospitalidad donde hallo nido de Jupiter el ave. The progessive geometry of relations of identity and difference continues in the third unit, verses 22-28. The key moment here is the "hallo hospitalidad" which negates the "-naufrago y des- defiado, sobre ausente-" of the first period. The pilgrim reaches on his "raft" the surf-line dividing Earth and Water; thus he is first ingested (" sorbido") by the undertow, then expelled (" vomi- tado ") by the surf onto the shore. This places him " no lejos de un escollo"-a variation of the previous ascensional image of the mountain pine standing against the storm. The shore cliff, which will later (55) become " arbitro igual e inexpugnable muro," marks the exact demarcation between Earth and Water. Where the hero's disaster is descensional (the " fall" of the shipwreck), his future pilgrimage must begin with his ascension of the cliff: hence the image (from below) of the "crown" of dry rushes and warm feathers, the nest of the Eagle as " ave de Jupiter." At the summit the " secos juncos " and " calientes plumas " both resonate with the "Libia " of the second unit as forms of heat and dehydration, but now manifesting the quality of hospitality and shelter (" nido "). At the base, the pilgrim emerges from his " expulsion " covered with " alga " (seaweed, green plant life like the rushes) and "espumas " (seafoam, white like the warm feathers). The spatial antithesis of</page><page sequence="8">240 M L N summit and base is converted into a relation of identity by the equation of the nest with the shoreline, below, which now shelters the pilgrim from the " Libia de ondas." As noted above, the Eagle is the animal metamorphosis which Jupiter assumed to seduce Gany- mede, whose identification with the pilgrim is already explicit. Both the Bull and this Eagle (as forms of Jupiter) are in antithesis with the epiphonemic "Dolphin" (as animal of Venus). The three animals, in turn, encode the interplay of the four elements: the pastoral Bull grazing in the heavens, Taurus as the sun, the wood on land becoming a dolphin in the ocean, the nest of the Eagle denoting the pilgrim's return to his proper element, the Earth. I have mentioned a tacit allusion to Venus in the earlier units. It should be kept in mind here that G6ngora rarely names or alludes directly to this central figure in classical myth in the course of the Soledades; nevertheless, her presence as a hidden metaphoric signifier is decisive to the thematic elaboration of the poem. (She is, in effect, a version of the " misterioso " ciphered behind the " corteza " of the text which the poet speaks of in the " Carta en respuesta.") The linguistic emblem for Venus is the curious repeated rhyme of " pluma " and " espuma," which here echoes the opposition/identity of "calientes plumas" (of the nest above on land) and the " espumas " (of the sea below). The key to this emblem is revealed in the crucial terminal couplet of the Soledad primera which cele- brates the sexual union of the rustic couple: Bien previno la hija de la espuma a batallas de amor campo de pluma. "Espuma" derives from aphro-geneia, "born of the foam" as epithet for the Greek name of the goddess, Aphrodite: consequently, the topical association, which G6ngora uses, of Venus with the ocean and the dolphin. The " calientes plumas " are detached from their immediate connection to the " ave de Jupiter" to function as a synechdoche for the opposing bird of Venus, the Dove (a common variant would be Cupid's "wings ") as symbol of mediation of discord in Nature or in the psyche. In part, the traditional symbolism of Venus/Aphrodite as repre- senting teleological providence behind the blind force of Nature (G6ngora's "mentido robador ") depends on her position in the intricate kinship system hypostasized in classical mythology. She is</page><page sequence="9">M L N 241 Jupiter's daughter, consequently in a fraternal relation (cf. the initial Cadmus-Europa) with Apollo, Mars, Diana, Bacchus, Mercury, Minerva, etc. As Vulcan's wife, therefore, she is sexually joined to at least a half-brother. And, significantly, she is made by Virgil the mother, and supernatural vehicle of the epic furor, of Aeneas, who is another concrete identification of G6ngora's abstract form of the hero as "wandering exile." In the material of the Urszene presentation analyzed so far, the implicit Venus-Jupiter relation has depended on the Water/Fire opposition of Taurus and the ocean. This now can be seen to involve a psycho-sexual dimension: Venus as Mother/Sister (the conventional topos of the ocean as mater genetrix), Jupiter as Father (the Bull, the Eagle as sexual energy and destructive force), Cadmus-Ganymede-Europa-Aeneas as the "violated" consciousness of the dependent adolescent. In the piscatory soliloquy of the Soledad segunda, which is the pilgrim's own address to the riddle of his character, he represents himself centrally through the emblem of the flight of Icarus: Audaz mi pensamiento el cenit escal6, plumas vestido, cuyo vuelo atrevido -si no ha dado nombre a tus espumas- de sus vestidas plumas conservaran el desvanecimiento los anales diAfanos del viento. (II, 137-143) Now the representation of the fall of Icarus involves crucially the elements of G6ngora's Urszene; hence the logic of the piscatory context of the soliloquy. As a didactic emblem, Icarus signifies the violation through excess of the prudential norm between extremes: Sun (the dream of flight), Ocean (the dream of enclosure or expan- sion on the surface). In conventional " Horatian" wisdom, Air and Water are unnatural elements for man.5 Analogically, the moral emblematism is compounded by G6ngora into a opposition of kinship relation: Icarus' ambition to fly into the Sun represents the 6 Compare this stanza from the " Bienaventurado albergue " encomium: No a la soberbia esta aqui la mentira dorandole los pies, en cuanto gira la esfera de sus plumas ni de los rayos baja a las espumas favor de cera alado. (I, 129-133)</page><page sequence="10">242 M L N overcoming of the Father, Daedalus, who has fashioned the very means of the overcoming; the Oedipal catastrophe inherent in the impulse, like the pilgrim's shipwreck, leads inversely into the ocean as Mother/Sister: softness, wetness, embrace (" Oh mar, oh tu, supremo / moderador piadoso de mis daftos "). We are meant to understand by the " desdefado " of verse 9 that G6ngora's persona manifests the Petrarchan typology of the lovesick consciousness. His sea-voyage is a flight into free space (and danger: " inconsiderado ") away from but also towards the alienated Woman, the " enemiga amada" of the Soledades who is the necessary condition of both his loss of harmony and its restoration in the indefinite future towards which his pilgrimage points. He bears, that is, a psychic disintegra- tion-an absence-manifested through a crisis of language itself, a confusion of the signifier, a fall of discourse into cathecresis or a " non-sense." The divided ego exteriorizes its trauma in the binary labyrinth of the genetic landscape. Foucault has noted the affinity which obtains between the sea and madness in the medieval institution of the Stultifera Navis: Navigation delivers man to the uncertainty of fate; on water, each of us is in the hands of his own destiny; every embarcation is, potentially, the last. It is for the other world that the madman sets sail in his fool's boat; it is from the other world that he comes when he disembarks. The madman's voyage is at once a rigorous division and an absolute Passage. In one sense, it simply develops, across a half-real, half-imaginary geography, the madman's liminal position.... Confined on the ship, from which there is no escape, the madman is delivered to the river with its thousand arms, the sea with its thousand roads ... he is the Passenger par excellence: that is, the prisoner of the passage. And the land he will come to is unknown-as is, once he disembarks, the land from which he comes. He has his truth and his homeland only in that fruitless expanse between two countries that cannot belong to him.6 This allows a certain insight into the relation of the Soledades as linguistic process and the narrative function of the pilgrim. The Venereal emblem of "espuma "/" pluma " serves polysemically as a metonymy designating the act of writing itself, G6ngora's pen tracing its imaginary voyage into a "silva (poetic form) /soledad Michel Foucault, Madness and Civilization, trs. Richard Howard (New York: Mentor, 1967), p. 21.</page><page sequence="11">M L N 213 (psychic territory) confusa" on the white ground of the page. What can be seen emerging from the structured complex of the Urszene is the (eroticized) genesis of a composition of language functioning as a psychagogy, a formation of " fallen " consciousness through discourse. These observations bring my analysis to the mid-point of the Urszene series, where the pilgrim attains the unknown dimension of the land that lies above and beyond his marginal position on the shoreline. After the chaos of Nature in the first verses, a kind of temporary calm ensues: 4. Besa la arena, y de la rota nave aquella parte poca que le expuso en la playa dio a la roca; que aun se dejan las pefias lisonjear de agradecidas sefas. Basic to this period (29-33) is the idea of a restoration of normal order (linguistic and natural). The ritualized offering of the wood to the rocks completes the cycle of metamorphoses that this provi- dential agent of the hero undergoes from its initial appearance as " opuesto pino " in verse 15, a cycle which is homologous with that of the pilgrim himself as sea-faring exile. That is, the wood is first presented in its normal context as a tree on land; then is alienated from its place and natural form into " lefio "-the cultural artefact of the ship-; then disaggregated by the storm into the broken "tabla "/" delfin "; here it is reintegrated with the element of Earth at the base of the initial mountain.7 The development of the fifth period (verses 34-41) in terms of this motif of restoration and " ordering" is equivalent, but in an inverse direction. Whereas, in the first case, the wood and the pilgrim return to their proper element of Earth, concluding the Roy Jones has alleged a "parallel between the physical and the moral order" in G6ngora's descriptive conceits: "The Poetic Unity of the Soledades," BHS, XXXI (1954), p. 193. One case is the image of wood in the second period. In the Metamorphoses (which is a necessary reference text for the Soledades), the pine/hill unity signifies the reign of the Golden Age, the landscape of innocence; the "fall" of wood into the ocean-that is the synecdoche of wood (" leio ") for shipping-marks the violation of proper limit imposed by Nature and the consequent decay of society into the historical conflicts of the ages of the lesser metals. See, on the theme of navigation in G6ngora, Robert Jammes, Etudes sur l'oeuvre poetique de G6ngora (Bordeaux: Feret, 1967) pp. 554-564.</page><page sequence="12">244 M L N chaos of the storm and shipwreck, now, in the second case, by wringing out his clothes the hero is restoring Water to its natural context, the ocean: 5. Desnudo el joven, cuanto ya el vestido Oceano ha bebido, restituir le hace a las arenas; y al sol lo extiende luego, que, lamidndole apenas su dulce lengua de templado fuego, lento lo embiste, y con suave estilo la menor onda chupa al menor hilo. The celebrated conceit reinvokes the antithesis of Fire and Water which opens the Urszene. The liquid flows from the clothes through the mediate sand of the "incierta ribera" back to the ocean (Venus). The sun, again as the anthropomorphic Taurus/Jupiter, " licks " the clothes dry, collaborating in the restoration. The wild energy of the Bull as " mentido robador " (storm) undergoes trans- formation into images of domesticity: " dulce lengua," "templado fuego," " suave estilo." With the pilgrim momentarily "desnudo," Venus and the Bull, Sun and Ocean, hover around the scene as proud parents over the birth of a child. The role of the Urszene, as representing the form of a genesis is accomplished. It will be noted that the pilgrim acts grammatically in the first three units principally as a predicate, a passive object of the chaos of elements which are the subjects of the active verbs. With the initial " Besa la arena " of the fourth period this relationship begins to transpose itself; the Urszene as natural totality becomes object, the protagonist subject. The place of the two restoration periods which concretize the pilgrim's transfer to land are to oppose the opening chaos of genesis by the sequence of purposive, ritualistic gestures which he now undertakes. The line of these gestures will extend into the trajectory formed by the pilgrimage itself, the " pasos," commencing with the ascension of the shore cliff in the gathering twilight, the subject of the sixth period, verses 42-51. 6. No bien pues de su luz los horizontes -que hacian desigual, confusamente montes de agua y pidlagos de montes- desdorados los siente cuando-entregado el misero extranjero en lo que ya del mar redimi6 fiero- entre espinas crepusculos pisando,</page><page sequence="13">M L N 245 riscos que aun igualara mal, volando, veloz, intrdpida ala, menos cansado que confuso, escala. The twilight and the difficulty of climbing tend here to reestablish the vortex of chaos and illusion the pilgrim has passed through in the storm: " desigual," " confusamente," " desdorados," " crepfuscu- los pisando," " menos cansado que confuso." Nature again dissolves into hyperbolic inversions: " montes de agua y pielagos de montes," "riscos que aun igualara mal, volando." But the decisive terminal " escala" gives coherent closure to the extended grammatic periph- rasis of the period with an image of the pilgrim's imposition of purposive action over this chaos of Nature. Along with the previous ritualization of the rescue, the " escala " manifests, through the con- crete axis of movement of the " pasos," the development of repre- sentations of work, technique, architecture, agriculture, sport, music, war in the poem-the multiple forms of cultural praxis which make the Soledades a kind of miniature historical anthropology. In the final period (verses 52-61), consequently, the whole landscape of the Urszene appears from the summit finally attained as "con- quered " and " legislated " by the pilgrim's action: 7. Vencida al fin la cumbre -del mar siempre sonante, de la muda campania arbitro igual e inexpugnable muro-, con pie ya mds seguro declina al vacilante breve esplendor de mal distinta lumbre: farol de una cabaria que sobre el cerro esta, en aquel incierto golfo de sombras anunciando el puerto. The permutation of elements now is apprehended as phenomeno- logical distinctness: " muda campaa "/" mar sonante." The Urszene, bifurcated by the cliff and the visual perspective from above, acquires an architectonic geometry (" inexpugnable muro ") and an anthromorphic identity (" arbitro igual "). The central line " con pie ya mas seguro " opposes the earlier "entre espinas cre- pusculos pisando " (48) and " una Libia de ondas su camino " (20). With the appearance of the light, the pilgrim's journey will be downwards (" declina ") and inland towards its source. This pas-</page><page sequence="14">246 M L N sage, which occupies the rest of the Soledad primera, is an anabasis on the " sea " of the land through mountains, valleys, paths, villages, orchards, culminating in the haven of the wedding hut and the sexual union of the bridal couple. After this, he will reappear on the shoreline at the beginning of the Soledad segunda with the wedding party; hence, the conceptual antithesis of the pastoral (and comic) first Soledad and the piscatory (and tragic) second. G6ngora prefaces the narrative conceit by having the light here signify doubly a "farol de una cabana" (pastoral) and simultaneously a port beacon or light ship as a psychological " trace " of the destination of the initial sea voyage. The light undergoes, in tandem with the pilgrim's movement, a series of metamorphoses (verses 62 to 90) from this initial piscatory / pastoral identity. Those bring him to its source, the goatherd's albergue, the initial form of human community which will index the mastery of consciousness over Nature: Llego pues el mancebo, y saludado sin ambici6n, sin pompa de palabras, de los conducidores fu6 de cabras que a Vulcano tenian coronado. (90-94) The "llego " and the invocation of Vulcan close definitively the passage through the initial Urszene and the cycle of transformation that had begun in the chaos of the "mentido robador." The terminal value of Vulcan in the logic of G6ngora's code of mythic allusion is that he is the archetype of the control of Fire, god of the forge. The nocturnal oak fire which attracts the pilgrim to shelter is the antithesis of the initial Taurus/Jupiter, Fire as a free element in Nature, limitless cosmic energy. Jupiter, is, in contrast, the archetype of sexual metamorphosis and disorder-rape, incest, homosexuality, bestialism, adultery-like Tirso's "burlador" the free force of shifting identity (" mentido ") which disintegrates the human norm. He is the image of the Father (of Venus), whereas Vulcan, as representing the human assimilation of Fire, is the Husband of Venus, that is, the form of rationalization and sublima- tion of sexual energy. He foreshadows the full human community of the wedding village and the apotheosis of G6ngora's algebra of division and unification in the terminal ritual of the Soledad primera. The "mentido robador" gives perhaps Cascales' sense of the</page><page sequence="15">M L N 247 Soledades as a Babel, a crisis of the signifier. But we have also seen that the crisis is ultimately an illusion, a deception. The expanding tissue of shifting oppositions in the Urszene sequence reaches a limit of potential chaos; then it dissolves into a structure of interaction as linguistic figures which hold in order the metamorphosis of the signifier, defining cycles of repetition and a "progress" towards cohesion and harmony. This is a mastery of contingency through language, a calculus of (in Gracian's metaphor) a " mundo trabu- cado"-the fragmentation of experience and the perversion of consciousness.8 In the binary "soledad confusa" of the poem, G6ngora interjects the pilgrim as a tertium quid, a principle of intelligibility. Through his mediating and transcoding function as Subject, the pilgrim becomes effectively mind itself (ingenio) hypostasizing its internal history in a pilgrimage of language. Consider again the question which prefaced this analysis, the charge of the lack of a " misterio scientifico " in the Soledades. In one way, Espinosa Medrano was quite right in dismissing it as irrelevant; " doctrinal" poetry in post-Tridentine Spain could have been at best a tiresome allegory of obsolete Aristotelean natural science and Scholastic apologetics. Gongora himself stakes his epistemological defense of the poem (in the " Carta en respuesta ") on the Platonic equation of poet and Vates. But I am inclined to see the Soledades, in a related way, as a special Spanish contribution to the development of scientific method and production. G6ngora's experiment and exercise in the territory of language-in the letter he speaks of the need of the reader to "trabajar el discurso "- belongs on the same methodological ground as the speculations of a Huarte or a Descartes on the foundations of reason and intelligence.9 8 Note Gerard Genette's genial aphorism on Baroque stylistics: "Le monde ainsi biseaute devient a la fois vertigineux et maniable, puisque l'homme y trouve dans son vertige meme un principe de coherence. Diviser (partager) pour unir, c'est la formule de l'ordre baroque. N'est-ce pas celle du langage m~me?" Figures (Paris: Seuil, 1966), pp. 37-38. 9I hope to develop this idea in a future monograph on the influence of Huarte's Examen de ingenios on Spanish poetics. Chomsky has identified the main tenet of " Cartesian linguistics " as " the observation that human language . . is free from the control of independently identifiable external stimuli or internal states . . .The language provides finite means but infinite possibilities of expression constrained only by rules of concept and sentence formation . . . The finitely specifiable form of each language . provides an 'organic unity' interrelating its basic elements and underlying each of its individual manifesta- tions which are potentially infinite in number." Cartesian Linguistics (New</page><page sequence="16">248 M L N His "wager" is with the dimensions signification potential in language, with a possible language which would express the reality of the human condition as free, self-creating, unalienated, universal, utopian. Passed beyond in the labyrinthine conceits of the Soledades is the idea of language reading out passively a content established and guaranteed by Nature or a divine will-the signatura rerum of Renaissance gnosticism. Rather, as our analysis of the opening sequence of the poem has implied, G6ngora deploys a language which has been invested with the power of a technology to harness and organize the "nature" of language itself into the service of human intelligence and desire.
