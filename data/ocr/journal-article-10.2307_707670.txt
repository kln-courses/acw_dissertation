Paper, DM. 14. DR. PAUL has written a methodical study of the place occupied by divine pity in the Homeric pattern of morality together with a brief survey of the development of the idea in the work of later epicists. Her dissertation well deserved the accolade it received from Professors Kraus and Lesky. The work is firmly based on an analysis of the texts and deals deftly with the researches of earlier students of religion. The instances of pity shown by divinities and human beings are listed and selected examples discussed at length. However, some of the common faults of the thesis genre, venial as they may be, are in evidence. Thoroughness may lead to irrele- vance or, in the opposite direction, to too narrow a focus. It is necessary to list and distinguish the Homeric vocabulary of pity, not so to report exhaustively the linguistic and etymological status of each term. The Homeric sense and interrelations of ~AEos, olKTpdS, oIAoS, etc., are not to be determined from their (rather obscure) etymologies but from their Homeric usage. Parts of the key scene, II. xxiv. 18-76, are discussed in five separate places-nowhere is it treated as a whole. The emotion of pity touches the hearts of about equal numbers of gods and men. The gods include all the active Olympians (Zeus being by far the most compassionate), and a sprinkling of minor divinities. Paul rightly maintains that the pity of the gods is part of Greek anthropomorphism-popular, rather than poetical, anthropomorphism, because the hope at' K JXAE'ra is bound up with the ritual of sacrifice. The expression of divine pity is motivated by the same circumstances as human pity. There is no theological doc- trine inherent in it, as we understand theo- logy. No one will quarrel with this. However, according to Paul neither is there any ethical principle involved in the act of pity, because a man cannot be obligated to feel pity, as he can in certain circumstances, for instance, be obligated to feel alS;d. For 9AEOS in Paul's view is a function of t~Ata. Indifferent as the gods may be in general to the lot of man, some gods are helpers and saviours by nature, others 'love' certain men (especially their own offspring), and certain peoples and places. Moved by OLAla these gods render assistance to men, unless the claim of pity is overridden by a higher force, e.g. by Moira. There is some difficulty in accepting this altogether as Paul presents it. The behaviour of ethical terms is admittedly complex and cannot be justly treated in a few words. But it must be observed that it is a misleading error to suppose that )tAla or LA)dr-q (for that is the Homeric term) is a 'tiefergehende pers6nliche Ergriffenheit': it is rather the recognition by deed of a certain status and relationship. This relationship is important in Homeric society. Those familiar with the methods of A. W. H. Adkins (the name is missing from Paul's bibliography) can at once draw certain conclusions. Because the relationship is important, who is ?blAov is fairly clear, and the claim of the #01o% for aid and protection, enforced by al&amp;tc' and v4pLETL, creates a powerful and well-attested obligation. But the claim of the EAEEv0'd is very weak. It is often overriden by various aspects of the self-sufficient man of valour- supremacy in battle, love of honour, or lust for vengeance. The claim of the AEELV0ST rests, it appears to me, on the affront to ordered society constituted by one suffering what he does not deserve. This is the basis of Odysseus' claim on Leucothea (Od. v. 299 ff., read with the parallel passage II. xxi. 273 ff., where the term ~A'ELVdS appears). A rationa- lized justification for the ethic of pity ('Life is uncertain. You may one day want pity yourself') is made by Odysseus to Amphi- nomus at Od. xviii. 125 ff- New College, Oxford J. B.
