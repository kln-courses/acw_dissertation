Published for the London School of Economics and Political Science by Percy Lund, Humphries and Co., London, 1940.) The continuance of this series, which makes available by photolithic reproduc- tion data of interest mainly to specialists, is a heartening sign that anthropology in Britain is not suspended by the war. This volume completes the unique account of a Polynesian annual cycle of religious rites that was begun in No. 1 of the series. The rites of the monsoon season, part of which took up Volume I, are here concluded, and rites of the trade-wind season described. The volume is almost entirely descriptive. The author explains: "In the study of Polynesian religion so much has been re-construction, so little the result of the actual observation of rites that a statement of the facts, in detail, has seemed to me to be the most imperative need." Yet this mass of detail is full of illuminating suggestions for comparative study. Thus the first rite described is the fono, best known in its Samoan form as a governing council, but here a set speech formerly recited once a year in the interests of good husbandry and righteousness, and suggesting what seemed to these people the most essential rules of conduct. Similarly, the full de- scription of sacred dances and that of the ritual extraction of turmeric supplement the comparatively sketchy record of these activities from other parts of Polynesia. Although interpretation is kept to a minimum, there is enough of it to clarify what otherwise would be a bewildering catalog. Excellent use is made of occasional inci- dents in which opinions differed, or something went wrong, to reveal meanings and attitudes. The conclusions, taking up only a page and a half, suggest that minute differ- ences in procedure are significant not so much as variants of a hypothetical proto- type, but "in relation to difference in rank, social standing, individual interests and even character and personality." Two of the premises of Tikopia religion are stressed. "The most fundamental is the existence of a set of invisible beings, ancestors and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 663 spirits who may be called deities." Their character, anthropomorphic in a distinctly Polynesian way, is suggested in a few sentences. A second basic premise is the con- cept of manu, a variant of the familiar mana. In Tikopia, Firth finds manu "is not the figment of anthropological theory, a vague concept of impersonal power; nor is it simply the mainspring of magic, as opposed to religion. .. . In its broadest form it is the correlate of any belief that human efforts, unaided, are insufficient for suc- cess; that there is an unknown factor in the equation between men and nature. But it is not the principle of success in abstract form; it is the concrete manifestation of the results." This seems to deserve fuller explanation. If the kind and degree of ab- straction involved could be clearly defined, it might light up dark recesses in primi- tive religion and, for that matter, semantics. Explanation may be forthcoming in a later interpretive work. Problems explic- itly left for treatment elsewhere are "the analysis of Tikopia formulae and their imagery; the inadequacy of commonly accepted criteria for drawing a distinction between magic and religion"; and "the relation between past and present which is expressed in myths, formulae and rites." The twelve photographs are well taken and well reproduced. Most of them are unique in that they show Polynesians in the act of performing their rites. Since this book will be used mainly for reference, an index, or failing that, a more detailed table of contents would have been helpful. EDWIN G. BURROWS UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT</page></plain_text>
