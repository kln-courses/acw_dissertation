<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gregory Schrempp Folklore and Science: Inflections of "Folk" in Cognitive Research While folklorists are wringing their hands over the term "folk" and its derivatives, intriguing and largely unselfconscious usage is made of these terms in several overlapping fields concerned with epistemology. Among the more interesting usages are those found in some branches of "cognitive science," a field created in the last few decades out of shared concerns of computer science, linguistics, psychology, philosophy, folklore, and anthro? pology. A central goal of cognitive science is to develop models of basic cognitive processes. "Folk," "folk knowledge," "folk science," "folk classifica? tion," and the like occur frequendy in discussions of such processes, though primarily in the works of the more philosophically and humanistically inclined commentators (for ease, I will use "cognitive science" to refer to what might more properly be characterized as a contingent within it). "Folk" is usually used as a label for principles or systems of cognition, especially classification, that have developed outside of the formalized procedures characteristic of academic disciplines, especially those of mathematics and the physical sciences. The last few decades have also seen numerous attempts by folklorists to offer new and improved definitions of "folklore," many of which attempt to disassociate themselves from the connotations of backwardness and paro? chialism?the want of epistemological sophistication?that is so often im? plied by "folk" or "folklore." Among the problems encountered by such redefinition projects is the fact that these can quickly become esoteric? specific to the field of academic folklore. In some cases such definitions overlap only slightly with less technical?dare I say "folk"??usages, even with those used by academics who are not folklorists (folk academic defini? tions?). Words can mean whatever we want them to, but that doesn't necessitate anyone else's going along. Scrutinizing usages of "our" terms within another Journal of Folklore Research, Vol. 33, No. 3, 1996 Copyright ? 1996 by the Folklore Institute, Indiana University</page><page sequence="2">192 Gregory Schrempp academic field helps us to monitor our situation within academia generally. Viewing our own conceptual apparatus as refracted in another discipline offers a glimpse into our own quandaries. "Folk" as a modifier within epistemology, and most visibly in some cognitive science literature, is en? meshed in an intriguing set of tangles, most or all of which have some sort of counterpart in the discipline of Folklore. Encountering the snares on the terrain of an "other" provides the critical faculty with an opportunity to ex? perience them in a new way, more in the manner of an object than a subject. As the contrary to academic science, "folk" is applied, in the epistemo- logical sphere, to knowledge systems of societies largely or entirely outside the influence of academic science, as well as to the "everyday" knowledge? the non-academically scientific moments?of people in scientific societies (hereafter "science" will mean academic science). It is frequently noted that even in scientific societies a relatively small part of life is comported accord? ing to the formal scientific procedures. The contrast of "folk" vs. "scientific" can be elaborated in different ways and with vasdy different implications. I will discuss four general ways in which the contrast of "folk" and "scientific" has been elaborated. I. As a displacement model. "Science" and "folklore" offer alternative, competing explanations of the same phenomena, and hence they have an antagonistic relationship. In this view, the rigorous findings of science historically displace the less critical opinions of folklore. 2. As a complementarity model. "Folk" and "scientific" designate two distinct kinds of knowledge, founded on different cognitive principles, both of which are legitimate and necessary for human life. 3. As a continuum model. "Folk" and "scientific" knowledge differ signifi? cantly; but in terms of ultimate properties and procedures, the relationship of "folk" and "scientific" knowledge is one of continuity, not of "great divide." 4. As a reflexive model. "Folk" and "scientific" exist in a mutually constitutive relationship; each serves as a vantage for assessment and critique of the other. 1. DISPLACEMENT MODEL In this model, "folklore" epitomizes popular but unexamined ideas about the nature of things, while science denotes research aimed at developing rigorously substantiated explanations; scientific explanation in its very nature seeks to displace folkloric explanation, at least as far as literally- intended descriptions of the natural world are concerned. Though the notion of this antagonism has been with us for several millennia, the pro? ximate formulations, those at the root of the modern discipline of Folklore, derive to a large degree from cultural evolutionists of the nineteenth cen-</page><page sequence="3">Folklore and Science: Inflections of "Folk" in Cognitive Research 193 tury?figures such as E. B. Tylor. Twentieth-century folklorists have gener? ally tried to fashion alternatives to the "displacement" model. But whether or not folklorists have succeeded, the displacement model retains a signifi? cant presence among some writers in cognitive science and related fields. A flamboyant and popular articulation of the displacement model is Carl Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. The histori? cal schema of this work has essential affinities with the schema that, in its articulation by E. B. Tylor, influenced several generations of folklorists in the late nineteenth century. Notably, both Tylor and Sagan invoke "folk? lore" as an exemplar of the credulous, anthropomorphic, entertainment- seeking, and desire-ridden habits of mind that science seeks to counter with its rigorous and laborious path. Note, for example, Sagan's use of the term "folklore" in the following passage: At the heart of some pseudoscience (and some religion also, New Age and Old) is the idea that wishing makes it so. How satisfying it would be, as in folklore and children's stories, to fulfill our heart's desire just by wishing. How seductive this notion is, especially when compared with the hard work and good luck usually required to achieve our hopes. (1995:14) Tylor's most influential writings were concerned with "animism," the belief in spiritual beings and agencies. Tylor regarded animism as a particu? larly natural and attractive error of reason; more than any other principle it was responsible for human misunderstandings of the natural world. Sagan, too, in his concern to unmask present day pseudosciences, takes particular aim at theories that assert what he regards as scientifically dubious animate agencies (i.e., the "demon-haunted world"), and once again "folklore" provides useful illustrations of the erroneous principle in question. For example, Sagan points out how &lt;4world folklore" depicts the moon anthro- pomorphically, exemplifying "a characteristic conceit of our species to put a human face on random cosmic violence"( 1995:45). Tylor wrote with confi? dence in science's continued progression, while Sagan writes at a moment that he regards as threatened with retrogression. But the sense of scientific reasoning engaged with animistically inclined pseudoscience in a sort of zero-sum game?with human mentality as the prize?provides a common undergirding to the two visions.1 Sagan's book is, among other things, a fascinating document of Ameri? can anxieties in the late twentieth century. It embodies numerous contradic? tory tendencies, not the least of which is the fact that this appeal to scientific sobriety is presented by one of the great showmen of science. The Hallow? een black-and-orange glossy jacket is apt for this book, which complements the high-tech wizardry of Sagan's "Cosmos" series with an equally bedazzling appeal to the lurid, centered especially in luxuriant discussions of witchcraft practices. But here it is enough to call attention to Sagan's restatement of an</page><page sequence="4">194 Gregory Schrempp older schema. Sagan may be marginal both to philosophy of science and cognitive science; but Dmon is useful as a conspicuous example of a schema? and a connotation of "folklore"?that is present, as we shall see, more subtly in more specialized cognitive research. 2. COMPLEMENTARITY MODEL The idea of "scientific" and "folk" as necessary complements in human knowledge has to do with the scientific/folk dichotomy coming to be aligned with another dichotomy which has proven to be of great interest in cognitive sciences, namely the opposition of Aristotelian logic and so-called "fuzzy logic." Aristotelian categories are based on qualities shared by mem? bers of a set and are binary in the sense that a given entity either possesses them (and therefore is unambiguously "in" the category) or does not possess them (and therefore is "out" of the category). Ludwig Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations), however, pointed out many cases in which one cannot find qualities universally shared by members of categories used in natural language. Rather, categories are sometimes based on "family resem? blances," that is, clusters of features, not all of which are possessed by all members of the category. Later research, notably that of Eleanor Rosch, has revealed that, in real-world categorization, humans frequently depend upon "prototypes" or "best examples" vis-a-vis progressively less-good examples. Categories based on "family resemblances" or "prototypes" have fuzzy bound? aries and contrast with the clear boundaries of Aristotelian binary catego? ries. The issues surrounding Aristotelian vs. "fuzzy" logic are manifold and complex. One issue of immediate consequence to Folklore lies in the tendency in some cognitive research to align the Aristotelian/fuzzy di? chotomy with the scientific/folk dichotomy, as if Aristotelian logic is the modus operandi of science and fuzzy logic is the modus operandi of folk knowledge. Something in this alignment seems very natural,2 and yet it is fraught with contradictory and unresolved tensions. It is far from certain that this alignment really works. Examples of the tension can be seen in John Taylor's recent Linguistic Categorization. Taylor takes the position that humans make use of both binary and fuzzy logic, and he labels the categories produced by these two types of logic as, respectively, "expert" and "folk." Folk categories are catego? ries of "everyday use," are structured around "prototypical instances and are grounded in the way people normally perceive and interact with the things in their environment" (1991:72). "Expert categories" on the other hand are "specifically created, usually in conformity with Aristotelian principles," for what experts do, namely the "drawing of boundaries" around fuzzy catego? ries (1991:72). This includes creating "technical definitions"which "serve to</page><page sequence="5">Folklore and Science: Inflections of "Folk" in Cognitive Research 195 eliminate the fuzzy edges from the categories, giving them the status of technical, rather than merely pre-theoretical constructs" (1991:72). The complementary dualism implied in Taylor's position is of course given an interesting twist by the choice of "expert" and "folk" as labels. The terminology would seem to introduce, at least by connotation, something of an asymmetry of sophisticatedness between the two kinds of categorization (more significant than any connotations of unsophisticatedness of "folk" is its position as the contrary of "expert"). But the situation is more complex. Taylor also informs us that he is using the word "expert" in its "folk" sense (1991:72), an observation which threat? ens to turn the connotative hierarchy topsy-turvy. And in a later section, apdy entided "Hedges," Taylor quotes Lakoff in claiming that the widely spread assumption that our ordinary way of classifying is through Aristote? lian principles is itself "our everyday folk theory of what a category is" (quoted in Taylor 1991:75). One might get the impression that such inver? sions are preparing us for the great deconstruction to follow: science is about to be revealed, in its foundations, as a form of folk belief (and surely one of the favorite aims of deconstructionist readings is the deflating of claims of superiority in systems of knowledge or taste). But the deconstruction does not transpire; rather, the demonstration of the folk quality of a purportedly scientific concept serves as an indication of the necessity of more science, and an illustration of how easily the scientific can lapse into the unexamined folk belief.3 This turn-around is an instance of what has become one in a repertoire of standard moves in cognitive research, where great delight is taken in showing that a purportedly scien? tific concept is really a "folk" concept. But, again, the momentary collapsing of the "folk" and the "scientific"?which, in a deconstructively inspired reading might lead to a questioning of the epistemological privilege of science?is more likely, in the context of cognitive science, to ultimately reenforce that sense of science's privileged vantage. In the course of Taylor's discussion, we thus move from a concept of "folk" as denoting one (of two) types of categories of which all humans make (seemingly legitimate) use, to "folk" as a designation of uncritical?or, to be less mealy-mouthed: incorrect?understandings of the world which can be remedied through rigorous empirical research. The notion of "folk" which we end with, of course, has much in common with Sagan's schema (includ? ing the notion that religion offers one of its primary locations). 3. CONTINUUM MODEL I invoke the rubric of "continuum" to designate perspectives that argue for the recognition of significant continuities between "folk" and "scientific" knowledge. The strongest of these assert that "science" is merely one more</page><page sequence="6">196 Gregory Schrempp form of folk knowledge; and it is probably fair to say that the stronger con? tinuum models are more characteristic of the cultural fields (such as folk? lore, anthropology, and ethnic studies) than they are of cognitive science or history of science. There would seem to be two main sources, in the "cul? tural" fields, for resistance to the idea that "science" deserves a special epis- temological status: (1) the tradition of "cultural relativism" in its many forms and (2) a sociological orientation, which tends to lead toward the assess? ment of systems of knowledge in terms of their overall social functionality? their efficacy in the upholding of distinct ways of life. While cognitive sci? ence is certainly not unaware of such sociological considerations, "folk" knowl? edge is frequently assessed in terms of how well it accomplishes the goals of academic science; I take the latter to be (or at least to be believed to be) something like a socially decontextualized description of the physical world through isolatable propositions that can be instrumen tally verified or falsified.4 In discussing continuum models from cognitive literature, I focus on a work, Stephen Stich's Deconstructing the Mind, that some folklorists might regard as overly cautious, or too circumscribed, in its defense of "folk psychology"; Such might seem to be all too willing to sacrifice the entire fleet to win the battle. Nevertheless, Stich's book provides a fascinating tour of the complex, and sometimes quite mysterious, idea of "folk" knowledge as it has taken shape in fields other than folklore. In briefest terms, Stich is confronting the claim of some of his colleagues that some of the entities posited by "folk psychology"?such as beliefs, desires, and other mental states?do not really exist. Specifically, it is claimed that physical brain-states modelled on computer-inspired processing networks (such as so-called "connectionist" models) can more economically explain cognition than the mind states posited by folk psychology, and hence the latter are to be regarded as superfluous entities, mere fabrications from incorrect theories. The program of ridding scientific perspectives of such fabrications, and confining them to the realm of non-existence, has been labelled "eliminativism": In its strongest form, eliminativism claims that beliefs, desires, and many of the other mental states that we allude to in predicting, explaining, and describing each other do not exist. Like witches, phlogiston, and caloric fluid, or perhaps like the gods of ancient religions, these mental states are the fictional posits of a badly mistaken theory. (1996:3) Stich writes as one who was originally attracted to the doctrine of eliminativism but who is now skeptical. He accepts that cognitive research may disprove many of the specifics of folk psychology, but he rejects that such disproofs entail the non-existence of the basic entities?the mental states?posited by folk psychology. Stich's great concern is to discover why he had gone wrong. He attributes his acceptance of the entailment of the eliminativist agenda to a certain theory of reference which he has come to</page><page sequence="7">Folklore and Science: Inflections of "Folk" in Cognitive Research 197 reject (at least as a sole theory of reference). Stich's discussion of theories of reference is highly technical. Perhaps of more direct interest to folklorists are some of the specific illustrations that he cites in exploring theories of reference; for example: One way to explain the problem is to imagine a community of ancient stargazers who have what we now know to be wildly mistaken views about the objects visible in the night sky. They think that most of them are holes in a black and otherwise solid celestial dome through which we can see the light in the heavenly region that surrounds the dome. But even though their theory about the stars is about as mistaken as it is possible to get, it seems to make perfectly good sense to say that when these ancients spoke about the objects in the night sky, they were talking about stars. (1996:35) But how wrong, or in what respect wrong, does a previous theory have to be for the present-day analyst to conclude that rather than talking incorrecdy about existent things, the holders of the theory were talking about things that do not exist?5 The gist of Stich's claim is that there are no rigorous rational procedures for determining the ontological conclusions that should be drawn when a reigning theory is adjudged defective, and that such decisions are fre- quendy made on other grounds (especially political and social grounds). The consequence specifically for folk psychology is that there are no ration? al grounds for going from disproofs of theories of "folk psychology" to the ontological conclusion that the entities posited by folk psychology do not exist; that the status of mind states are presently indeterminate; and that their ultimate disposition will have much to do with social and political negotiation. There is something refreshing in "folk" ideas being considered in a genuinely metaphysical frame, and, if Stich's conclusions seem timid, less robust than they might be, their significance stands out when his work is juxtaposed to Sagan's. In the narrower sense, Such is arguing against the assumption that the basic posit of "folk psychology"?mind states?should necessarily be regarded as the next spiritual entity in line to fall to science. But more broadly, he is skeptical of monolithism and finality of interpreta? tion in the history of science, and particularly skeptical about the possibility of finding a historical pattern of necessary ontological conclusions ratio? nally required by the findings of science.6 I turn to two aspects of Stich's work that would be of particular interest to folkloristics and which are quite odd. The first of these concerns Stich's attempt to locate the source of (what he now sees as) his original error. Stich recounts the discovery of his error as occurring in the context of juxtapos? ing a highly systematic theory of reference (wherein if one term mis? matches, the entire theory falls) with a more historically situated theory of reference, which, among other things is rather more liberal in admitting</page><page sequence="8">198 Gregory Schrempp degrees of overlapping reference between correct and incorrect, or earlier and later, theories about similar phenomena; he adopts the latter, historical, theory of reference as the corrective to the former, which was his own earlier view. So, Stich concludes, it was an inadequate theory of reference that provided the hidden extra step that led him astray. But I find Stich's assessment of the sources of his error to be a bit precious; isn't there a kind of philosopher's snobbery in attributing one's wrong turns to such lofty errors? The fact that Stich finds his solution in the consideration of history is significant. But if it is a certain take on history that promises to straighten things out, might it not be that a certain take on history (and not a theory of reference) supplied the hidden, ill-fated step? If not for Stich (who, after all, wants an error befitting an analytical philoso? pher) , then at least for the rest of us, the extra step comes our way in the form of a deep cultural principle of Western civilization: "the schema of the conquest of mythos by logos" (Gadamer 1975:242). In relation to this master schema, "eliminativism" emerges as a technical, disciplinarily situ? ated variant, and Sagan's treatise as a vernacular, best-seller variant. Regard? ing anything "spiritual" (whether spiritual entities or spiritually inspired designs such as Ptolemaic epicycles), one who has internalized the vision of the historical displacement of mythos by logos possesses the connective that carries one from perception of initial discontents with an explanatory scheme to predictions of its impending demise and the relegation of its contents to "fiction." Interestingly, in an earlier work, a work leaning more towards acceptance of the impending demise of folk psychology, Stich does cite "an inductive generalization from the sorry history of folk theories in general" (1983:229) as a reason to think that folk psychology might be radically wrong: [F]olk psychology really is a folk theory, a cultural inheritance whose origin and evolution are largely lost in prehistory. The very fact that it is a folk theory should make us suspicious. For in just about every other domain one can think of, the ancient shepherds and camel drivers whose speculations were woven into folk theory have a notoriously bad track record.. . . However wonderful and imaginative folk theorizing and speculation has been, it has turned out to be screamingly false in every domain where we now have a reasonably sophis? ticated science. (1983:229) Such certainty is difficult to sustain under Stich's later (1996) key argument about the history of science, namely, that it is necessary to recognize the decisive influence exerted by larger social currents?currents not strictly within the formal rationality of scientific procedure?in the construction of the historical fate of theories judged erroneous. The second oddity?the real treat of Stich's book?is the rich and varied use of the term "folk" (especially in the phrase "folk psychology"); below is a sketch of some relevant issues.</page><page sequence="9">Folklore and Science: Inflections of "Folk" in Cognitive Research 199 a.) Words frequendy invoked by Such as correlatives of "folk" uses are "commonsense," "everyday," and "ordinary," as in the beliefs of ordinary people. In many respects "folk" seems to be treated not as culturally variable but as universal: the natural way that anyone would think, including the natural errors any human would make. A lot rides on what is meant by "commonsense," and this is not clear. Stich is writing for an academic audience but often writes as if any human would assent to his version of "commonsense," which seems to be thought of more as a natural than a cultural product. In "folk," too, the issue of "natural" vs. "cultural" is an important point of uncertainty. b.) When considering the sense of "folk" among Stich and his colleagues, it becomes evident that what is considered to be "folk" theory or "commonsense," and conversely what is "scientific," may change signifi- candy through time. In some cases, "folk" and "scientific" appear to have almost switched places since the early twentieth century. For example, aspects of Aristotelian logic are now cited as comprised in "folk" psychologi? cal theory. As noted above, Lakoff and Taylor cite a belief that we think in Aristotelian categories as a "folk" belief. But at the turn of the century, stemming from the nineteenth-century evolutionist picture of thought as evolving from indistinction to clarity, it was common to picture Aristotelian logic as the very pinnacle of philosophy and science, and as the antithesis of our natural mental inclinations?we had to struggle for millennia to achieve it. Although we know of it from the writings of academics (e.g., Durkheim and Mauss [1972]), this view of our mental inclinations is as heavily conjec? tural, as little subject to empirical verification, as the alleged present-day "folk" view that we naturally think in Aristotelian categories. Hence, histori? cally, it seems that we find nearly opposite assumptions regarding what our "folk" theories consist of. Such considerations raise problems for the claim that "folk" really designates some natural (i.e., non-cultural) commonsense. To some extent at least, "folk" seems to be a kind of mythical construction (see point c, below) of a position inverse to the latest scientific truth, under the supposition that this inversion represents what people in those prior, dark days must have believed. c.) Some of the cognitive scholars seem to regard themselves as fluendy bi-cognitive.7 Besides writing sophisticatedly as scientists of cognition, they seem to regard themselves as able to give accurate self-report of "folk" theory; the underlying assumption would seem to be that everyone is folk and some people are, additionally, scientific while still retaining their folk fluency. There are some fascinating quirks here. First, discussions of folk cognition are dotted with what seem to be stereotypes of folk thought and presentation (in their terms, this would be a sort of folk folklore). A favorite word invoked to characterize folk theories is "myth," and indeed some scholars have composed memorable litde scenarios or origin stories as</page><page sequence="10">200 Gregory Schrempp media for portraying the principles of folk psychology (e.g., see the ex? amples by Sellars and Fodor in Stich 1996:119,122). The tendency to invoke myth as the form appropriate to a theory that is about to be displaced by science might be seen as one more way of instantiating the schema of the conquest of mythos by logos (discussed above). There is frequent appeal to introspective methods, if not a tendency to adopt the lack of rigor presumed to be characteristic of folk thought. Given the tendency in Stich's academic tradition to use "folk" as a designation of unreliable theories, the attempt at "folk" self-reporting conjures up something like the classical dilemma inher? ing in the set of statements conditioned by the premise "everything I say is false." By their own criteria, why should we trust them? d.) Stich (1996:41) well points out that there are two theories involved in his type of research. There is the folk theory; then there is the analyst's theory about the folk theory I would add that among researchers on cognition, it is sometimes difficult to determine which is on stage at any moment. Regarding "fuzzy logic," for example, it is sometimes unclear whether a particular theorist is merely excited by a new scientific theory about thought that is "folk" and which therefore is of interest to science solely as an object, or whether the theorist is excited by the prospects of non- Aristotelian logic deployed in scientific research. The fact of two modes of cognition, either seemingly capable of standing as object of analysis or as analytical framework, renders the situation interestingly complex, with immanent possibilities of accidental spillovers. 4. REFLEXIVE MODEL In the "complementarity model," complementarity referred merely to a division of labor in the application of two cognitive modalities ("folk" and "scientific"). Each modality was superior for certain applications, and be? tween them they seemingly took care of all possible circumstances. But the idea of polar cognitive modalities implicitly contains the possibil? ity of a "reflexive"?that is, a mutually constitutive?relationship, each modality reflecting the other back to itself, thus providing a means of evaluation and self-critique, or even a kind of grounding unavailable to a given modality from its own resources. That "science" has played this role for folklore is incontestable. Along with other fields the study of folklore has been greatly influenced by the enlightenment agenda of bringing the study of social/cultural phenomena under the regimen of the natural sciences. In a scientific worldview, this move is tantamount to recognition of existence. However, without wishing to imply that the state of folklore research vis-a-vis the "science" of culture is adequately understood, it is to our present purpose to move on to consideration of the question of a possible reverse dynamic: to the question of whether there is a significant tradition of</page><page sequence="11">Folklore and Science: Inflections of "Folk" in Cognitive Research 201 folkloric representation, or indeed a folkloric construction, of science? I will argue that there is such a folkloric construction, though (as science is generally the privileged term) more effort is required to bring it into focus. My observations here were triggered by a chance conversation that I had with a sociologist of science (who, because of the clandestine nature of his comments shall remain an anonymous informant/informer). The writer in question, who had no special training in Folklore, several times referred to the "folklore" of science. He was using "folklore" in part to refer to ideas and opinions that circulate informally among the community, or subcommuni- ties, of scientists; and as this is certainly not far from what we mean by "occupational folklore" I did not immediately make anything of it. After our conversation, however, I began to realize that he was also using "folklore" as a contrast to published analyses and proceedings, and sometimes specifi? cally to designate ideas and opinions that were retained sub rosa?i.e., as "folklore"?because of a fear that they would imperil the official image that scientists wanted to present to the public. He implied, for example, that the folkloric accounts of physics portray a greater disarray in the world of theory than do published accounts. It may be that the use of "folklore" and the characterizations of the sciences which I encountered in this chance conversation are somewhat idiosyncratic. However, I recendy encountered a similar usage in the very popular introduction to the field of chaos theory, James Gleick's Chaos: Making a New Science. Benoit Mandelbrot is a key figure in the surge of interest in "fractals"; in discussing one of Mandelbrot's early projects con? cerning errors in electronic data transmission, Gleick comments: By talking to the engineers, Mandelbrot soon learned that there was a piece of folklore about the errors that had never been written down, because it matched none of the standard ways of thinking. . . . (1987:91) This is indeed an interesting use of "folklore": it inverts the normal relationship of, shall we say, pure truth and socially compromised truth. The usual connotation is that "folk" knowledge is compromised because it is coerced by traditional ways of thinking which are in turn enmeshed in social functionality (e.g., to question religious beliefs would entail social disrup? tion); and science is removed from such concerns. But in the above usages, "science"?or at least science in its official version?emerges as coerced by its theoretical traditions and/or its social pragmatics, and it is in the realm of "folklore" that one catches glimpses of uncompromised truth. The folklore in question, of course, should not be equated with the folklore of non- scientists. On the other hand, the double context of usage?the folklore that is nonscience, and the folklore of science?does suggest a perceived parallelism between two realms of ignorance situated, so to speak, on the opposite edges of science, namely, that which is "beneath" science (and</page><page sequence="12">202 Gregory Schrempp which science is in a position to critique) and that which is "beyond" science (and from which a critique of science may emerge). It may be that the relationship is best understood as a dialectic of motivation, each term continually creating the necessity of the other. Besides this novel use?as theory-defying observations that circulate clandestinely among scientists?one finds other connotations of folklore in Gleick's work. Some of these are relevant to the idea of a folkloric construc? tion of science, at least in the sense that they attempt to reveal the relation? ship between scientific ideas and ideas that exist in folklore. One would expect any perspective that recognizes a "reflexive" relationship between "science" and "folklore" to also presuppose some degree of continuity between them (as discussed in relation to "continuum" models, above), as a condition of their reflecting one another. Gleick uses "folklore" in one instance to suggest the continuity of a folkloric idea and one of the main tenets of chaos research: The Butterfly Effect acquired a technical name: sensitive dependence on initial conditions. And sensitive dependence on initial conditions was not an altogether new notion. It had a place in folklore: For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; For want of a shoe, the horse was lost; For want of a horse, the rider was lost' For want of a rider, the battle was lost; For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost! In science as in life, it is well known that a chain of events can have a point of crisis that could magnify small changes. (Gleick 1987:23) "In science as in life": a most interesting opposition and correlation, and one that seems to be a slightly larger version of the relation Gleick sees between science and folklore. That is, the convergence of the folkloric view and the view of "chaos science" is not limited to the principle of "sensitivity of initial conditions"; rather, Gleick seems to regard "chaos theory" as furnishing the means to close the overall rift that has developed between the world perceived through science and the world perceived through life as ordinarily lived: [T]he revolution in chaos applies to the universe we see and touch, to objects at human scale. Everyday experience and real pictures of the world have become legitimate targets for inquiry. There has long been a feeling, not always expressed openly, that theoretical physics has strayed far from human intuition about the world. Whether this will prove to be fruitful heresy or just plain heresy, no one knows. But some of those who thought physics might be working its way into a corner now look to chaos as a way out. (1987:6)</page><page sequence="13">Folklore and Science: Inflections of "Folk" in Cognitive Research 203 The fact that Gleick cites scale as the first of his criteria is not an accident; it is a point that he is insistent upon: As the revolution in chaos runs its course, the best physicists find themselves returning without embarrassment to phenomena on a human scale. (1987:7) Gleick's emphasis on the theme of the return to human scales of magni? tude as part of the closing of the rift between scientific and "lived" under? standing of the world, flows from what he regards as the dominance of concern with the very large and very small, cosmology and quantum me? chanics, in the worldview of contemporary science. If one goes back in time to some of the charter texts of Western philosophy and science, to literature that proclaims the opening of a rift between ordinary understanding of the world and scientific understanding, one finds that Gleick's emphasis on human scales is not misplaced. Lucretius's first-century b.c. poem, DeRerum Natura, for example, is only one of the more elegant calls for replacing ordinary understanding of the world with a new, atomistic view. In the new view, an understanding of the structure of the world and of all processes of causation within it are to be sought in the actions of entities "vasdy below the range of our senses?vastly smaller than the first objects, on a descending scale, that the eye can no longer discern" (Lucretius 1951:133). The proper? ties and interactions of atoms would replace the agency of spiritual beings, so that Lucretius's atomistic theory is also rightfully seen as an early cri? tique of the demon-haunted world. But in the midst of ridding us of the demon-haunted world, which is also the world of human scales of magnitude, Lucretius makes some arguments in which we encounter one more?perhaps the original and most impor? tant?sense of a folkloric construction of science, as he eulogizes the new view: Who has such power within his breast that he could build up a song worthy of this high theme and these discoveries? Who has such mastery of words that he could praise as he deserves the man who produced such treasures from his breast and bequeathed them to us? No one, I believe, whose body is of mortal growth. If I am to suit my language to the majesty of his revelations, he was a god?a god indeed ... ?who first discovered that rule of life that now is called philosophy, who by his art rescued life from such a stormy sea, so black a night, and steered it into such a calm and sun-lit haven. Only compare with his achievement those ancient discoveries of other mortals that rank as the work of gods. Ceres, it is said, taught men to use cereals, and Bacchus the juice of the grape; yet without these things we could go on living, as we are told that some tribes live even now. But life could not be well lived till our breasts were swept clean. Therefore that man has a better claim to be called a god whose gospel, broadcast through the length and breadth of empires, is even now bringing soothing solace to the minds of men. (1951:171)</page><page sequence="14">204 Gregory Schrempp Lucretius creates a scheme of the significance of the new understanding of the world by invoking the old one?a scheme of gods, a mythology. One could argue that Lucretius is merely being cunningly literary: he does not profess a belief in the gods but only claims that the achievements of some men are so great that they might be spoken of as though gods. In order to valorize science, he makes use of the mythical scheme, even while dismissing it. But the question arises whether the mythic scheme can ever be dismissed. Even this use of mythology?as a scheme of spiritual values invoked as analogy in a naturalistically conceived world?is still a use of mythology, and a sort of fudge-factor. The old question returns of whether science can provide its own grounding, a grounding that will be considered acceptable in human terms, or whether there will always be a necessity for some other appeal to a way of understanding the world which is more ... sort of.. . folk, for instance.

The bulk of Tylor's data on animism was drawn from various societies of the world as reported in the then-burgeoning ethnographic tradition; but it should be noted that Tylor also was interested in the spiritualistic fashions of his own society in the Victorian era and attended seances in order to investigate spiritualistic claims. The comparison of Tylor and Sagan is not intended to implicate Sagan in the charges of racism that have frequently been made of Tylor and other nineteenth- century evolutionists. The racism of the latter arose in the context of the application of a scheme of the development of science in Western society as a yardstick for cross- cultural ranking of the world's societies and more especially from a resorting to biological arguments to explain what he regarded as differences in relative attain? ment. Though there is plenty for staunch cultural relativists to dislike in Sagan's historical schema, the specifically racist propositions of the earlier social evolution? ists are not characteristic of Sagan's analysis. 2. What makes this alignment seem natural? Some possibilities: a) The "fuzzy" of fuzzy logic seems to go with the "warm and fuzzy" of the strain of nostalgia in folklore. Emotional resonances might be: gregarious, expansive folk vs. harsh formal scientists and exclusive binary categories. b) Fuzzy logic is more "natural," and therefore logically and historically prior to, Aristotelian logic, which had to wait for Aristotle and the birth of philosophy. Does Aristotelian logic involve more of a deliberately contrived formalism?</page><page sequence="15">Folklore and Science: Inflections of "Folk" in Cognitive Research 205 c) Much of the data demonstrating the existence of fuzzy logic comes from natural language contexts (e.g., Wittgenstein's examples, Rosch's research). d) Taylor (1991:65 if.) thinks "prototype" categorization is developmentally prior to Aristotelian categorization. e) Durkheim and Mauss (1972:8 ff.) argue that kinship genealogies (i.e., "family resemblances") were the first human classifications. f) In general we regard education as a process of replacing looseness with precision; do we unwittingly translate this idea into the assumption that "fuzzy logic" is first and gradually is replaced by Aristotelian logic? 3. Taylor (1991:75) links our folk beliefs about classification with religious beliefs, specifically the Genesis creation story, while Lakoff says: This classical [Aristotelian binary] theory was not the result of empirical study. It was not even a subject of major debate. It was a philosophical position arrived at on the basis of a priori speculation. Over the centuries it simply became part of the background assumptions taken for granted in most schol? arly disciplines. In fact, until very recently, the classical theory of categories was not even thought of as a theory. It was taught in most disciplines not as an empirical hypothesis but as an unquestionable, definitional truth. (1987:6) 4. Complementarity models sometimes rest their assertion of the necessity for two forms of knowledge on something like the distinction drawn here between knowledge whose telos is society and knowledge whose telos is socially decontextualized, instrumentally verifiable description (Cf. Tambiah [1990:chapter 5]). 5. Such choice of perspectives is, of course, a dilemma frequently faced by ethnographers who are trained in the legacy of Western academic science. Upon encountering beliefs in spiritual agencies, ethnographers frequently correlate these with psychic processes recognized in more naturalistically construed psychological theories, thus making their "existence" more palpable for writers/readers who have rejected the "demon-haunted world"; the implicit or explicit claim is that the spirits "refer to" specific psychic processes. But the problem of differentiating between the continuous and the incompatible, when comparing belief systems, has always been one of ethnography's most vexing problems. 6. For example: The skeptical conjecture that I've been trying to make plausible in the last few pages is that the normative-naturalist strategy will not uncover principles of rational ontological inference that are rich enough to tell us, in lots of the most interesting cases, what ontological conclusions we ought to draw when we come to believe that some previously accepted theory is seriously mistaken. In support of this conjecture, I've suggested that in many historical cases the resolution of ontological questions can be explained in part by the personali? ties of those involved or by social and political factors in the relevant scientific community or in the surrounding society. (1996:70) 7. It might be interesting to compare this to a trend in anthropological theory that recognizes the special situation of bi-cultural researchers (e.g., see the discus? sion in Fischer 1986).</page><page sequence="16">206 Gregory Schrempp REFERENCES CITED Durkheim, Emile, and Marcel Mauss 1972 Primitive Classification.
