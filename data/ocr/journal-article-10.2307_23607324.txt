<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND PSYCHO-BEHAVIORAL FOUNDATIONS OF GANDHISM M.V. Naidu Political Science, Brandon University Brandon, Manitoba, Canada Gandhism is a holistic philosophy that contains many challenging propositions and it evolved through experimentations with innovative schemes in the realms of politics, economics, social and cultural affairs, education, health, minority rights, women's liberation, international relations and world peace. All Gandhian ideas and schemes are built on the foundations of certain philosophical and psycho-behavioral postulates that pro vide rational and scientific explanations of Gandhian humanism. These postulates, in my opinion, can be identified as the following six: (1) Safya (truth); (2) Prema (love); (3) Seua (service); (4) Saruodaya (universalism); (5) Ahimsa (nonviolence); (6) Satyagraha (nonviolent struggle). Satyagraha &lt; &gt; Sarvodaya</page><page sequence="2">Satya (truth): The sanskrit term satga literally means truth. Search for the truth has been an eternal struggle for theologians, philosophers and scientists all through the ages. The core of Gandhism is the concept of truth. All the three Middle-Eastern religions1 — Judaism, Christian ity and Islam, conceive of the supreme truth as God. However, religionism presents God in personalized and anthropomorphic terms, representing human values, attitudes and behaviours. In theological terms, religions proclaim the comprehension of the truth (i.e., the absolute or the supreme truth). In other words, the founders and the followers of religions, all finite human beings, claim that they can comprehend in/iriity; a contradiction in terms. The religionists go further; they claim that their religion has the monopoly over the truth; other claimants are, therefore, false; i.e., all other religions are wrong and their sacred books, their prophets, their popes and their churches are peddlers of falsehood, not the truth; at best, other religions, in their opinion, are immature, inferior or partially blessed in their comprehension of and commitment to the truth. How does any religion claim the truth? Through a belief system that is blind and narrow-minded; blind belief can be both non-rational and irrational. For its propagation, irrational faith relies upon ignorance and indoctrination; for its adherence, it inculcates intolerance and fear; and for its sustenance and expansion it invokes physical and structural violence. Thus religionism defines truth in terms of irrationalism, intolerance, authoritarianism and violence. With such attributes, religionism shapes and activates the personal, the social, the cultural, the national and the international agencies and activities of the religious believers. Most often religionism invokes racism, sexism, chauvinism, authoritarianism and militarism in the defence and propagation of its religious beliefs.2 Unlike theologians, philosophers have defined truth vari ously — as the First Cause, the grund norm, the absolute, the</page><page sequence="3">eternal, the mathematical concept of infinity, the logical concept of the hypothesis etc. 1 have defined elsewhere, truth as the hypothetical absolute of an ultimate explanation of universal validity; and I maintain that in the realm of human understanding, truth can only be conceptual.3 To all sciences, truth is a human concept that is subjective and relative to human knowledge and experience. Every scientific search for truth begins with a hypothesis that is formulated on the basis of human intuition, knowledge or experience. Experimen tation and verification that are conducted on the basis of the hypothesis, may prove and disprove the hypothesis. Therefore, hypothesis, by definition cannot be called the truth. Gandhian "Truth": Gandhian approach to truth can be seen as rational and ethical though expressed in religious terminology, essentially to communicate with the Indian masses. This has led to certain confusion. Religionists, both in the West and in India (where they are called "communalists") have claimed that Gandhi was an adherent of Hindu religion. I contend that Hinduism is not a religion, as the term is used with reference to Judaism, Christian ity and Islam. Some sects of Hindus may contain certain features that resemble those of religions.4 At one time, Gandhi made the statement that "God is truth." But Gandhi's God is not God like the Judaic Jehova, or the Christian God/Supreme Father, or the Islamic Allah/Khuda. In other words, Gandhi's God is not a supreme (male) being sitting, like a monarch, on a throne in Heaven (above the sky), who can sleep or keep awake, who can be angry or pleased, who can be bribed or beseeched, who can be punitive or partial, who can be revengeful or forgetful, and so on and so forth. Religions, it seems, have made God in the image of man. Gandhi's God is, in the philosophy of the Upanishads (the ancient Hindu philosophical treatises), a nameless and a formless power or energy or grund norm that cannot be seen or comprehended by finite human beings. When Gandhi realized that his phrase — "God is truth," was being seen or interpreted in the narrow terms of theology and</page><page sequence="4">blind religionism, and not in the broad terms of philosophy and open-ended rationalism, he reversed his phraseology; he said — "Truth is God". In other words, God to Gandhi is a philosophical concept, not a theological belief; it is a logical concept of infinity, not an irrational ultimate of blind faith; it is a hypothesis for human investigation into the unknown, not an unquestionable postulate of blind belief. "To me," said Gandhi, "God is truth and love; God is ethics and morality; God is fearlessness. God is the source of Light and Life . . . "5 If the truth, by theological definition, is absolute, infinite and eternal, how, then, can a human being comprehend the truth? A limited being cannot comprehend the absolute; a finite being cannot understand infinity; and a time-bound being cannot grasp in her mind the vistas of eternity. So when religious leaders claim knowledge on the existence and on the attributes of God, the truth, the absolute, the omnipotent and the eternal, they are claiming to be superior to God because God is within their grasp; if they deny this argument, then they are generating a philosophi cal contradiction and a logical fallacy because a part cannot comprehend the whole, and the finite entity cannot see or identify the infinity. In philosophical and scientific terms, the human being can only conceptualize or hypothesize the truth, but human concept is not the truth and scientific hypothesis is not the reality. The nature or quality of human conceptualization is the product of human capacities, environment and experiences; and these factors vary from person to person, society to society, and time to time. In other words, all human knowledge is subjective, relative and tentative.6 Philosophy and science deal only with concepts of truth that are bound by time and space. These concepts are continually examined, experimented with and refined or rejected. Further, philosophy and science establish the fact that all normal human beings are capable, potentially and actually, of thinking and gathering knowledge. This potential intellectual equality of humans also means that all human beings must be</page><page sequence="5">provided the same opportunity and the same freedoms to develop their thinking and knowledge.7 Human equality and liberty in intellectual pursuits can lead to many different concepts of truth that are equally valid until proven invalid. Thus, any monolithic approach to the conceptualization of truth is irra tional, anti-intellectual and anti-human. On the other hand, pluralistic approach to truth not only generates a variety of concepts of truth, but also demands freedom, tolerance, empa thetic understanding and dynamic search for better and better comprehension of truth. Human minds that seek simple, final and unchanging truth could be disappointed and disheartened with the complexities, the subjectivity, the relativity and the tentativeness of human conceptualizations. Their frustrations could turn them into skeptics and cynics — those who disbelieve everything and those who refuse to search for the unknown declaring the unknown as the unknowable. For such individuals, blind faith and irrational beliefs could become their escape or their consolation. The rational or scientific approach starts its search for truth with the premises that human being is the measure of all truth; that the absolute or the ultimate truth can only be a hypothesis; that human conceptualization of truth, the only modality of rational search for human understanding, can be refined and redefined through endless struggle to improve existing knowl edge. In science, therefore, every established truth is truth until it is disproved. Thus, scientific knowledge moves between accept ance, challenge and change. In other words, human concepts of truth should be constantly examined, the unproved should be discarded, the convincing ones should be incorporated in order to improve existing knowledge. If all human knowledge is subjective, relative and tentative, how, then, can any religion or ideology claim comprehension of the absolute truth or condemn other religions or ideologies making similar claims? Or attack those that deny the possibility of human comprehension of absolute truth? These monolithic, narrow-minded and intolerant values and attitudes are possible</page><page sequence="6">only through irrational faith and blind beliefs system. Gandhism is opposed to such irrational and fanatic religionism. In the words of Gandhi: All faiths constitute a revelation of truth, but all are imperfect and liable to error .... We must be keenly alive to the defects of our faith ... we would not only not hesitate but would think it our duty to adopt into our faith every acceptable feature of other faiths.8 The Gandhian approach to truth, therefore, demands an open mind, an empathetic understanding of other's concepts of truths, a willingness to accept convincing new proof and a readiness to change existing views — and all without ill-will, prejudice, intol erance and violence. The Gandhian truth, (satya) is a negation of the monolithic and negative assertions of religionism, racism, sexism, jingoism, authoritarianism, militarism and materialism that pronounce fanatic finalities, that preach prejudices and that resort to violence of thought, word and deed. In a word, without religionism, Gandhian invocation of God is not theological; it is only a metaphor for rational and scientific hypothesization of the truth, satya. Prema (love): Rational approach to truth implies not only certain philo sophical values, but also certain socio-psychological elements. Rationality requires intellectual humility and open-mindedness, and empathy and respect for others' views. Every rational enquirer realizes that his or her own knowledge is, by definition, limited, and therefore the enquirer should be ever ready to receive and examine new or different ideas. But such reception can be hindered if one has preconceived notions towards others. In other words, prejudice, suspicion, fear, anger or hate can cloud the mind towards others. On the contrary, empathy or sympathy can keep the gates of the mind open for the entry of new ideas. But empathy cannot exist where disrespect prevails. Assumptions that other persons are ignorant, stupid, sinful or damned, cannot</page><page sequence="7">inculcate respect. Without respect towards the mental and human qualities of other persons, empathy cannot arise. Without empa thy and respect, open-mindedness is impossible. And without an open mind we cannot hear; even while hearing, we may not listen; even after hearing and listening, we may refuse or hesitate to understand. Understanding of others can help us grasp others' ideas. The logic, the soundness and the persuasiveness of a new idea constitutes its beauty. Thus understanding leads to the apprecia tion of beauty, and to the attraction and the admiration for the beautiful. Perception of beauty can evolve into "liking." Intensi fied liking grows into "love" or Prema. By eliminating prejudice, fear, hate and violence, love or prema becomes the fruitioning of understanding and appreciation of beauty of all kinds — beauty of the body, of the heart and of the head.9 Thus prema creates invisible bonds among all human beings. As Gandhi writes — When you want to find Truth or God, the only inevitable means is Love, i.e., nonviolence, and since I believe that ultimately the means and the end are convertible terms, 1 should not hesitate to say that God is Love.10 As the source of understanding, appreciation and enrich ment, and as the expression of nonviolent and peaceful relations, love has been the core concept in the social philosophy of many thinkers and reformers who have identified prema in various terms and concepts. To Jesus Christ prema is "love"; to Francis of Assissi prema is "compassion"; to Aristotle it is "friendship"; to the leaders of the French Revolution the bond of love is "fraternity"; to sociologists love for the society is "affiliation or nonalienation"; to the psychologists, it is "belongingness"; to the patriot, love for the country is "patriotism"; to the modern social analysts, prema is "community consciousness"; to Gandhi "truth is love" and "God is Love." Seva (service): Prejudice, hate and violence lead to uncaring and intolerant</page><page sequence="8">behaviour, and even to a desire to destroy or hurt the object of our disapproval and dislike. On the contrary, understanding and empathy leads to the perception of goodness, i.e., beauty, and to growth of love. Love leads to "giving" and "sharing," because it evokes a desire to care for and to serve the ones we love. Such service, in Gandhian terms, is seva. In the process of seva the lover is willing even to sacrifice and suffer for the wellbeing of the object of love. Sacrifice is tyaga; self-suffering is tapasya. Thus love {prema) conquers our ego, banishes our selfishness and greed, and ennobles us. Love without service is superficial lip service; service without love is a mechanical or involuntary act performed out of sense of duty or discipline. "The test of love," according to Gandhi, "is tapasya and tapasya means self-suffer ing."11 "Voluntary service of others," said Gandhi, "demands the best of which one is capable, and must take precedence over service of self."12 In the commercial culture everything is for "buying" and "selling" at a price. We "sell" commodities, ideas, knowledge, friendship, love, and so on; and we "buy" goods, goodwill, affection, services, etc. The capitalistic ethic teaches us that "you can't get something for nothing," and that "everything has a price." In other words, everything we do for others is and ought to be motivated by our expectation of compensation, profit, reward or gain. Profit or gain is seen as the only "incentive" that prompts all human activities, including service to others. The incentive for any service could be monetary and materialistic or psychological — social honour, title, praise, gratitude, or thank fulness from the receivers of the service. While the materialistic rewards boost selfishness, greed and acquisitiveness, the psycho logical rewards pamper the ego and egotism, boost self-impor tance and superiority complex. Contemporary capitalist-com mercialism has vastly expanded this ethic of incentive-reward as never before, and this ethic has penetrated deep into our psyche shaping every relationship in the society — between the mother and the child, the wife and the husband, the teacher and the pupil, the employer and the employee, the administrator and the operator, the politician and the public, the priest and the church members, and so on and so forth.</page><page sequence="9">The concept of compensation introduces another unhealthy element — the focus on rights, instead of duties. When reward becomes a right, it not only enhances self-centredness, but also introduces the conditionality for love and service. When individuals are brainwashed on the concepts of incen tives and rewards, they can be disappointed or frustrated or angered if they don't receive the expected compensation. The frustration of the giver ends up hurting the receiver of the service. Both are unhappy; both end up with negative feelings. Such negativism nullifies the goodness of service and sacrifice, and becomes counter productive. Knowledge, affection and service should be seen as duties, not rights, so that the ego is sublimated into selflessness, and loving and giving become unconditional and remain anonymous. Unselfish service is the manifestation of true love; as such, service becomes the lover's happy obligation. According to an old saying in Urdu, one must do a good deed and drop in the river. Bhagavad Gita prescribes that service should be without any expectation of or desire for reward. Gandhism focuses on duties rather than on rights;13 if everyone performed his/her duty, then the rights of others could be protected and guaranteed without being de manded and enforced. If everyone could develop true love, then everyone would be eager to render service to others without expectations of rewards. Without such expectations, there would be no disappointments; without disappointments, there would be no frustrations, no anger and no bitterness; without recrimination and conflicts, life could be cooperative and constructive, and satisfying and even inspiring. Gandhi insisted that all those who followed his movement, should render some service (without reward) for social uplift; he called this requirement "constructive programme."14 Some of these programmes included helping Khadi industries, village sanitation, uplift of women, basic education, care of the lepers, health and hygiene, etc.</page><page sequence="10">Sarvodaya (universal wellbeing): Understanding and empathy for one should not be built on the bases of misunderstanding and hatred for another. Love and service for one person or one group should not mean dislike and disservice for another person or another group. The capacity to love can be unlimited and expansive. Human love should not be restricted by narrow-minded appeals in the name of race, religion, region, nationality, status or wealth. It is the tragedy of human relations that the capacities for human understanding, love and service can be artificially manipulated, controlled and even destroyed by racism, religionism, classism, nationalism, territorialism and materialism. If I admire the beauty of the Canadian Rocky mountains, cannot I also admire the same Rockies in California? On the same logic, why cannot I also enjoy the Alps in Switzerland, the Urals in Russia, or the Himalayas in India? If I love my Canadian neighbour because he is a good man, then why should I not be capable of loving other good men who happen to be Americans, Russians, Chinese or Nigerians, or who happen to be poor or rich, or who are physically handicapped or are Olympic champions? Thus Gandhian logic reaches out to all humanity. Gandhian universalism issarvodaya, i.e., sat ¡ja (truth), prema (love) and seva (service) must cover all universal dimen sions expanding to humanism. The doctrine of sarvodaya is very much relevant and crucial for the contemporary world that has evolved intricate, intiminate and critical interdependencies at local, regional, national and international levels, especially through industrial-technology and trade relations, and through military weapons, alliances and wars that threaten the very existence of humanity on earth. This approach should be meaningful even to those who advocate or pursue enlightened self-interest: healthy persons living in the midst of the diseased cannot remain healthy; the wealthy cannot become enriched by spreading poverty among the rest; the free people cannot enjoy their freedom when their potential partners are enslaved in chains. There will be no victors and vanquished in a world war fought with nuclear weapons. The environmental destruction in one continent cannot be restricted from affecting 10</page><page sequence="11">all other continents on earth. The fate and fortune of individuals, families, nations and ecologies have become interlocked. The choice before humanity is either universal existence or mutual destruction. Gandhian sarvodaya is a powerful message for humanity's coexistence and coprosperity. Ahimsa (nonviolence): The term himsa (violence) means the use of physical force that destroys things or that hurts, harms or kills human beings. As the opposite, ahimsa is nonviolence. The human action that inflicts physical pain or destruction, is the climax reached by psychological and emotional state caused by intolerance, fear or anger. This is sometimes called "psycho logical violence." Most often psychological violence is generated by economic deprivation, social mistreatment, cultural dissatis faction or political oppression. These factors constitute structural violence. Gandhism, therefore, prescribes nonviolence in thought, word and deed, and in the individual, the group, the nation and the world. Gandhism demands that the practitioners of ahimsa (satyagrahies) should, first of all, cleanse themselves of prejudice, spite and hate, and should inculcate empathy and goodwill towards others, including their opponents. This is ahimsa at the psychological level. Gandhism advocates national freedom and political liberties, social and cultural equalities, elimination of poverty and exploitation, and humanistic fraternity. If research for truth demands understanding and empathy, then intolerance and hatred cannot lead to truth; if appreciation and liking can evolve into love, then fear, firearms and force are antagonistic to love; if unconditional service is the manifestation of love, then egotism, desire for reward, or greed are antithetical to love. In a word, ahimsa is the foundation for satya, prema, seva, and saruodaya. In the context of the dualism of the means and the end, some view ahimsa as a strategy of action, or as the means for the ends of satya and prema. At an early stage, Gandhi accepted this view of ahimsa. But very quickly he realized the intimate interdepend 11</page><page sequence="12">ence between means and ends. "The means," Gandhi wrote, "may be likened to a seed, the end to a tree ... "15 In other words, the means predetermines the end or that the means and the end are the two sides of the same coin. Thus, ahimsa to Gandhism, became both the means and the end. Gandhi wrote: As the means so the end. There is no wall of separation between the means and the end . . . Realization of the goal is in exact proportion to that of the means. This is a proposition that admits of no exceptions.16 Merging the means and the end into a single category, Gandhi equated nonviolence with truth, with service, with love and with humanism. He enunciated "the sovereignty of ahimsa." "Nonvio lence," wrote Gandhi, "is cin active force of the highest order. It is soul-force or the power of Godhead within us . . . We become Godlike to the extent we realize nonviolence. . ."17 Satyagraha (nonviolent struggle): Literally, "graha" means holding on; satyagraha means seeking and hanging on to truth. In Gandhian terms satyagraha has come to mean nonviolent struggle against immorality or injustice; satyagrahi is the person who is involved in a satyagraha. If satya (truth), as propounded by Gandhism, is enlighten ment that liberates the human spirit from the darkness of ignorance, then pursuit of satya is the most meaningful search for humanity. Human beings should, therefore, continually struggle to seek and hold on to truth. When it is a struggle for satya, satyagraha needs the freedom to think and express, and the opportunities to seek and hold on to the improved concepts of truth. Liberty and equality are, therefore, the prerequisites for satyagraha. But liberty and equality without empathy become mere legalities or technicali ties. Thus satyagraha integrates liberty, equality and fraternity. If these prerequisites are not present, then satyagraha should be launched to struggle for attaining liberty, for creating equality and for inculcating fraternity. 12</page><page sequence="13">But satya, prema, seua and sarvodaya are built upon the foundations of ahimsa and are expressed throughahimsa; hence satyagraha can only be nonviolent. Gandhi called the nonviolent struggle, "the soul-force" or "truth-force." In Hind Swaraj Gandhi said — When I refuse to do a thing that is repugnant to my conscience, I use soul-force... If I do not obey the law and accept the penalty for its breech, I use soul-force. It involves sacrifice of self . . . (which) is infinitely superior to sacrifice of others.18 As the operational scheme of Gandhism, satyagraha has four elements: the perpetrator of the untruth or injustice; the nature of the untruth in the context of time and space; the satyagrahi who resists the untruth; and the techniques of the nonviolent struggle. First of all, at the beginning of a struggle the satyagrahies have little direct influence or control on the nature of a crisis and on the thinking and the behaviour of the perpetrator of the wrong. Hence Gandhism focuses on the satyagrahies and their methods of satyagraha. "Satyagraha, "said Gandhi, "is possible of fulfilment only by a long course of self-purification and suffering."19 This postula tion involves three elements. Firstly, self-purification that de mands purging oneself of psychological violence i.e., of intoler ance, prejudice, selfishness, dishonesty, vengeance, fear, anger, etc. Secondly, self-suffering through nonviolence that involves discipline and willingness to sacrifice and serve others even by facing death, physical pain, economic hardship, social ostracism, cultural deprivation, and political oppression. Thirdly, the disci pline, the training and the experience that a satyagrahi has to undergo in self-purification and self-suffering are not one-shot affairs, or sporadic or short-term undertakings; they demand long-term and consistent commitments and practices. Because satyagraha is commitment to truth, the satyagrahies should not knowingly pursue or demand un 13</page><page sequence="14">truth. They should be ever ready to discover their own faults and failures, while being ever-willing to acknowledge the truths in the opponents' positions. Satyagrahies should keep everything open without secret plots, dishonest deals or misleading propaganda; they should keep the opponent in formed on their own positions, policies and plans of actions. In Gandhi's words, "A satyagrahi bids goodbye to fear. He is therefore never afraid of trusting the opponents."20 In order to show goodwill, open-mindedness and credibility, the satyagrahies should be always willing to seek compromise if necessary, but without sacrificing principles.21 Because inculcation of love is the objective of satyagraha, the satyagrahies should be ever-willing to listen, to under stand and to empathize with their opponents.22 Satyagraha is noncooperation with the evil deed, not with the evil doer. Therefore, satyagrahies should never harm, or hurt, or exploit or even embarrass the opponent, simply because these elements will not lead to friendly relations (love); on the contrary, service and sacrifice are the manifestations of love, so the satyagrahies should be prepared to undertake seva (service) and tyaga (sacrifice) for the opponent. Self-suffering is the proud badge thatsatyagrahieswear. In other words, the satyagrahies, if they are true lovers, should be willing to die not only for their own "sins," but also for the "sins" of their opponents. Satyagraha is for the emancipation of both the victims of untruth and injustice, and of the perpetrators of these wrongs. Because a satyagrahi is committed to the well-being of not just one person, one group or one nation, but of universal well being (sarvodaya), he or she is never unmindful of the interests of other persons, other groups or classes, other towns or regions, other countries or continents. True satyagrahies can never plan to impoverish, disable or destroy others, including their oppo nents. Because the satyagrahies are committed to satya and prema, and are dedicated to seua and sarvodaya, they cannot resort to himsa i.e., physical force, structural violence and 14</page><page sequence="15">psychological violence. Gandhism rejects the doctrine of justified use of physical force in the name of fighting "evil" forces or ending the "unjust" wars, or in the name of self-defence. Especially in the context of the modem weapons of mass destruction and the nuclear weapons of human annihilation, any doctrine of "bellum justum" (just war) is irrational and inhuman. Against all evil and injustice Gandhism advocates nonviolent struggles, nonviolent police and nonviolent armies, or their contemporary versions of "nonviolent or civilian defence."23 Structural violence — poverty, discrimination and op pression — should be fought through nonviolent satyagraha. Psychological violence should be eliminated through the inculcation of rational and humanitarian values, attitudes and behaviour. Prejudice, hate and violence have never been eliminated on the principle of an eye for an eye; in Gandhian sense, doubling blindness can never enhance vision. The true and effective antidote to prejudice is truth, to hate is love, and to violence is nonviolence. Satyagraha aims at long-range transformation of human beings and societies even while fighting short-range crises. The techniques of Satyagraha: The techniques of satyagraha can be deduced from the Gandhian experiments and case studies. But as a social scientist in the real sense of the term, Gandhi was always experimenting, altering and developing new methodologies that suited different sets of circumstances. Gandhism should remain dynamic and open-ended in developing new techniques of satyagraha. How ever, the particular methods that Gandhian experiments evolved may be identified in the following terms: (1) Petitioning the government; (2) Taking court action; (3) Representation to the legislators, the political parties or the interest groups; (4) Appeal ing to the general public; (5) Participating in the elections. If none of those constitutional avenues are open or effective, what then? Satyagraha can then resort to extra-constitutional techniques, which can be broadly categorized into two — (a) nonviolent non cooperation with the perpetrators of injustice; and (b) civil 15</page><page sequence="16">disobedience i.e., nonviolent breach of the existing rules or regulations, and the preparedness to peacefully accept the punishment for such disobedience. The last two methods were the unique, the creative and the revolutionary contributions of Gandhism; they wed democracy to nonviolent revolution. This seemingly incompatible marriage that had never been tried in human history, has been proven most successful. Traditional democracy had made provisions for the first five methods. When those five methods were not always available, or when available were not effective, the dissatisfied or frustrated groups, classes or minorities, faced dead ends; the pre-Gandhian democracy provided no solutions. Without any other instrument of change, democracy became static, committed to status-quo. The instrument for change that the revolutionary ideology pro vided was violent damage or destruction of the political system. The violent method could be sabotage, terrorism, coupe d'etat, insurrection, civil war, or foreign military intervention or aggres sion. Violent revolutions led to counter revolutions, democracies established police states, and wars for democracy led to the creation of dictatorships. Traditional theorists on democracy failed to understand and point out that in the fundamental sense, democracy and violence are antithetical to each other. Rejecting both the static democracy and the violent revolu tion, Gandhism created a new dynamic force — nonviolent revolution, that is committed to democracy and also to radical transformation of the individual and the society. The nonviolent revolution cannot only stop the cycles of violence and dictator ship, but can also eliminate the staticism of democratic constitu tionalism. Unfortunately, even to this day Western democratic theory is still oblivious to the fact that true and lasting democracy has to be built on the foundations of nonviolence — physical, structural and psychological; Western democracies are still heav ily committed to violence in domestic affairs and militarism in foreign affairs that have been corroding the very foundations of democracy. A living testimony to the Gandhian experiment with nonvio lent revolution and the Gandhian legacy of far-reaching results is 16</page><page sequence="17">democratic India, the world's largest democracy and one among some thirty democracies that have been running for the last fifty years continually and effectively. In spite of being almost equal to the territorial size of the European continent, in spite of being the most pluralistic country in terms of races, religions, languages and social systems, in spite of the colonial legacies of illiteracy and poverty, and in spite of all the Western predictions of the early disintegration of India and the demise of its democracy, Indian democracy is alive and healthy without civil wars, coup d'etats, military or communist dictatorship. On the other hand, during the last fifty years many European and Latin American states and the more than one hundred Afro-Asian countries that became independent in the post-war era, have remained or have become authoritarian states. This unique achievement, however unrecog nized in the West, is very much attributable to the Gandhain education and legacy. To a lesser extent, the successes of cross-cultural applica tions of Gandhian methodologies have been vindicated in the following cases outside India: The ousting of Marco's dictatorship in the Philippines; the American civil rights movements under Martin Luther King; the Intifada movement of the Palestinians; the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, the independence movements in the Baltic countries; the overthrow of communist regimes in Eastern Europe; and the nonviolent dismantling of the Soviet Union and its empire. Even in the most authoritarian state on earth — China — the students organized the pro-democracy nonviolent agitation in the Tienanmen Square in Beijing. Conclusion: Gandhism is most relevant and important in dealing with the contemporary challenges of tribalism, ethnicism, racism, religionism, chauvinism, authoritarianism and militarism. Hence the need to have a clear grasp of the philosophical and the psycho-behavioral foundations of Gandhism, to restate them and to interpret them to make them relevant to our current crises. 17</page><page sequence="18">NOTES A religion like Christianity consists of six elements: (1) Blind belief in certain supernatural elements like God, heaven, etc., (2) A founder accepted as "the son of God," (3) A book of divine revelations, (4) A blind faith in the religious head accepted as "the vicar" of Christ, (5) The church domination (churchianity), (6) Ritualism in the name of religion.
