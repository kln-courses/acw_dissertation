<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Mead, Joint Attention,   and the Human Difference lawrence cahoone College of the Holy Cross the struggle between the parties bent on inflating humanity’s self- conception and those bent on deflating it continues. Mind, consciousness,  soul, reason, free will, language, culture, tool-use—all have been invoked as  the unique character of the human, some deriving from Judeo-Christian reli- gion, others from classical philosophy and modern anthropology. Opponents,  sometimes motivated by ethical concerns about the treatment of animals, and  buoyed by scientific advances in animal and especially primate studies, have  either deconstructed these traits or ascribed them to nonhumans. Seeking  to block human exploitation of nonhuman species, they argue that humans  are not “exceptional” and possess no “cognitive module” separating human  cognition from that of our closest nonhuman relatives (Booth; Fouts and  McKenna; McKenna; Fesmire). The attempt to draw such a distinction is  seen as the remnant of a Victorian mentality, its species-ism continuous with  human social domination.1 In the opposite corner, any discussion of human  animality or Darwinism is taken to be threatening.  This is an example of a subtle, complex problem made more intractable  by moral and political inflammation. Certainly our conception of nonhumans  has implications for how we treat them, just as all our notions of political  rights of and ethical obligations to humans rest on some distinction of hu- mans from nonhumans. And concern for the value and ethical treatment of  other animals, in reaction against their conception as value-neutral resources  for our use, is certainly legitimate. But surely we can justify ethical treatment  of nonhumans without accepting anthropomorphism on practical, ethical  grounds; presumably we can treat a being decently without insisting on its  likeness to ourselves.2  For a blanket denial of human distinctiveness is troubling. What would  it mean practically for humans to treat other species “equally” or with “equal  the pluralist Volume 8, Number 2 Summer 2013 : pp. 1–25 1  ©2013 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois </page> <page sequence="2"> 2 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 respect”?3 Would it be any more possible than for a deer to treat an owl, not to  mention a wolf, with equal respect? Is it right, morally or ecologically, to try  to extend the bubble of domestic civic morality that our species has uniquely  constructed (and, of course, continually violated) to wild nature? Are we to  prevent, not just human, but nonhuman predation? If we are responsible to  stop human adults from killing human children, should we stop Languor  males from killing Languor infants fathered by other males? Conversely, ought  we treat fellow humans the way other species treat their conspecifics, adopting  Languor practices, or like chimpanzees occasionally engaging in cannibal- ism? Isn’t the demand that humans extend a moral respect to other species a  demand that we adopt an attitude more or less unique among animals?4  The human side of this discussion brings another set of concerns usually  ignored by those concerned about animal treatment: human psychopathol- ogy. Some accounts of human distinctiveness concern attributes that can  be turned off by brain damage or fail to arise in abnormal development.  Neuropathology and developmental psychology are important sources of  information about the human difference, for they show what it concretely  means for characteristic human functions to be absent. To deny cognitive,  linguistic, and emotional “exceptionalism” would be to deny that, if a human  child functions at the level of, say, a nonhuman primate, anything important  is wrong or missing. But physicians and loved ones seem quite clear that  something is missing, and mourn its absence. Are they wrong?  If ideological conflict recedes enough for us to credit the evidence of  both science and our senses, there is a clear answer to the question, Are we  continuous or discontinuous with nonhuman species? That answer is yes.  We are like and unlike, or “continuous and distinct” (McKenna 37). We are  one species of animal among millions. This is not a revelation: Aristotle knew  twenty-three hundred years ago that we are animals by definition. Since Dar- win we have known we are a species of primate and share traits with primate  ancestors as well as other animal lineages. If one accepts naturalism, then it  is a category mistake to treat “human” versus “animal,” or the related “cul- ture” versus “nature,” as concepts of equal level. In the logical sense, they are  related as species to genus.  But having accepted naturalism, and recognizing ourselves as one evolved  species among others, it remains impossible not to notice how distinctive we  are. We are “exceptional” in the sense that in some respects we behave differ- ently from all other animal species on Earth (not to mention other biologi- cal kingdoms), including the primates and cetaceans that are closest to us in  brain size relative to body size. We are animals, and we are exceptional: we are  </page> <page sequence="3"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 3 exceptional animals. If we were to discover an ape or dolphin cooking, dress- ing up, recording its history in pictograms, or worshipping an icon of King  Kong or Flipper, would we have to revise our understanding of that species?  If so, then the absence of such a discovery is significant. In short, the human  difference is real, even if our understanding of it, along with our ethological,  neurological, and genetic knowledge of the complexity of nonhuman species,  will continue to evolve, or as Peirce would say, “converge” for an indefinitely  long time. We cannot avoid guessing about that difference, for we cannot  live among humans without differentiating humans from other living things.  Even the extension of moral concern to nonhumans requires we understand  their distinctiveness from us—for example, their characteristic abilities, needs,  and lifestyles—and from each other.5 Only that can allow us to treat pigs  like pigs, chimpanzees like chimpanzees, and humans like humans. Ascribing  features uniquely to humans by itself neither justifies nor implies that only  beings with this capacity have moral value. So the question is not whether to  assert the human difference. The question is what is the difference?  The problem with the question is that it is hard to answer. Indeed, the  question itself needs clarification. Every biological species is different, by  definition.6 To ask about the distinctiveness of a species is normally to ask  how it differs from others of its genus. In our case, all others of our genus  are extinct. While we are naturally interested in what distinguishes ourselves  from our nearest living evolutionary ancestors and their living descendents,  the great apes, we cannot assume they are more “advanced” or closer to us  than other nonhuman animals in all relevant respects. For example, in the  variety of our vocalizations, we are more like some birds than apes. Even in  terms of brain structure, there are non-mammal lineages in which different  brain modules have developed to achieve mammal-like sophisticated learn- ing (e.g., the nidopallium caudolateral seems to allow complex learning in  crows, who lack the laminated neocortex mammals have).  It is also useful to remember that, while humans are primates, we did not  evolve from existing apes. Homo sapiens evolved only 200 thousand years ago  directly from an earlier species of the genus Homo (e.g., Homo erectus), which  evolved from yet earlier Homo species (e.g., Homo habilus), which evolved from  earlier non-Homo “hominin” species (e.g., Australopithecus), which evolved  from an unknown primate precursor we shared with chimpanzees six to eight  million years ago, which evolved from an unknown common ancestor of  all the great apes long before that. There are six million years of evolution  separating us from the lineage of any extant nonhuman ape. Many hominin  species litter those years; only we are left. No species is d iscontinuous with  </page> <page sequence="4"> 4 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 historical species or phylogenetic history, but we have been made relatively  more discontinuous with existing species by those extinctions. The species  with whom we would have been most “continuous” no longer exist.7  Certainly we cannot assume there is, or could be, merely one human dif- ference. Species are distinct in multiple ways, and so are we. Geist lists twenty- nine “diagnostic features” of Homo sapiens (Geist 412–13). For example, the  notion that we are only mentally gifted is wrong. We are physically endowed  to be jacks of most trades. Large mammals with opposable thumbs, an om- nivorous gastrointestinal tract, teeth for grinding and tearing, feet good for  quiet stalking, the ability to climb trees, run long distances, and swim (the  great apes cannot), daylight color vision from a head held aloft by an up- right stance leaving hands free, a larynx capable of nuanced vocalizations—  humanity’s achievements are barely conceivable without these. Still, what  most concerns us here is our core mental distinctiveness, that is, cognitive,  emotional, and hence behavioral attributes that exceed the capacities of all  other Earthly species (although these will be dependent on a host of geno- typic and phenotypic factors).  There are some famous candidates for our core distinctive trait(s). We are  tool users and makers. It was once common to consider this unique, but it is  now known that a variety of mammals and birds use rudimentary tools, even  carrying them to the site of their use for the purpose. Our intellectual abili- ties are an obvious candidate; for example, we have a capacity for discursive  learning or “reasoning” that appears unique. We seem to have a distinctive  kind of agency, our acts being more open-ended or “free” and subject to moral  evaluation. This may be related to some special self-consciousness (although  here, careful distinctions would have to be drawn from analogous nonhuman  behavior). Certainly human language is far more complex than any nonhuman  system of communication. We speak sentences composed of meaningful units  (words) governed by syntactic rules of assembly, hence can form an unlimited  number of sentences (what is called recursivity). How much of, and in which  respects, human language could be exhibited by nonhumans is unclear.8 Last,  our use of signs extends to culture, which we create and transmit across time  (although some claim evidence of generational transmission of local cultural  learning among nonhumans).  All these are objects of a growing literature at the crossroads of anthropol- ogy, paleontology, primatology, neurology, cognitive science, developmental  psychology, linguistics, and philosophy of mind, which cannot be summa- rized here. It would, however, be particularly striking to find a candidate  core feature that cuts across and plays a role in the genesis or expression of  </page> <page sequence="5"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 5 many of the candidate features above, if such can be found. Does some hu- man capacity link to the others listed, forming a thread that runs through or  enables the whole nexus of such traits? Some contemporary research suggests  there is. Notably, it was formulated a century ago by American philosopher  George Herbert Mead. Today the capacity is called mind-reading, the ability  to recognize and attribute mental states to conspecifics, which in the human  case seems to develop through the phenomenon of joint attention between  infant and caregiver. This is tantamount to or dependent on what Mead called  the ability to take the perspective of another. It is a prime candidate for a, if  not the, core human difference. We will explore Mead’s notion, its support  by some contemporary research, and its possible significance. Mind-Reading Mead Mind-reading is the ability not merely to recognize and predict a conspecific’s  behavior—which many animal species do—but to attribute mental states to  the other. This can often be observationally and experimentally discriminated  from mere behavioral prediction. A crucial part of our human equipment, it  can be dissected into the abilities to attribute perceptions, attitudes, goals, and  false beliefs, which abilities are acquired by children at different ages. Mind- reading is explained by two rival theoretical perspectives, “theory of mind”  and “simulation theory,” the former claiming attributions presuppose a folk  psychological theory or set of concepts about the mind of the other inferred  from behavior, the latter claiming such attribution is not primarily concep- tual or inferential but an internal simulation on the part of the attributor,  often called “empathy.” The issue was introduced into comparative ethology  and philosophy of mind thirty years ago by Premack and Woodruff ’s essay,  “Does the Chimpanzee Have a Theory of Mind?” (Premack and Woodruff ).  Many mammals categorize objects on the basis of perceptual similari- ties, remember objects in spatial locations, follow and anticipate object  permanence when the object is temporarily unobserved, and use insight  in problem solving. They cognize or “know” (Griffin; Kornblith). Many  recognize fellow troop members, kin and dominance relations (to them- selves), have strong affective ties, predict behavior based on emotional sig- nals, use social communication, cooperate in problem solving, and learn  by observing others (Tomasello). Nonhuman primates seem additionally  able to recognize “tertiary” relations—that two other primates are related,  for example, submissive to dominant—as well as analogous relations—that  x and y are related like b and c. </page> <page sequence="6"> 6 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013  However, based on a mammoth survey of primate testing, Michael Toma- sello claims nonhumans do not recognize the intermediaries of intentional or  causal relations, they do not understand that the relation of antecedent and  consequent, or stimulus and response, may entail an intermediate causative  force or agent intention, hence the same result might be preceded by a variety  of antecedents (Tomasello and Call). Thus they do not ascribe intentional  states, or at least complex intentional states like belief states, to others.9 Most  telling, he notes a host of nonverbal communicative acts that are simple for  us, but that wild primates do not perform. In . . . natural habitats nonhuman primates: do not point or gesture  to outside objects for others; do not try to bring others to locations so  that they can observe things there; do not actively offer objects to other  individuals by holding them out; do not intentionally teach other in- dividuals new behaviors. (Tomasello 21) And there appears to be an affective dimension to this. Jane Goodall her- self, after many years of experience with chimpanzees in the wild, wrote: “I  cannot conceive of chimpanzees developing emotions, one for the other,  comparable in any way to the tenderness, the protectiveness, tolerance, and  spiritual exhilaration that are the hallmarks of human love. . . . [This] may  represent the deepest part of the gulf between them and us” (van Lawick- Goodall 194). Might there be a kind of social relating, with both cognitive  and affective features, that forms a key difference between ourselves and our  closest living relatives?  A century ago G. H. Mead argued against the current of most of modern  philosophy that communication is logically and temporally prior to mind.  A human mind is a set of activities that emerge through social interaction  rather than the other way round. His most famous innovation was “significant  gesture.” Gestures are the communicative behaviors that animals produce  to enhance the process of “mutual adjustment.” One organism responds to  another’s act, or to an environmental condition, by a signaling device that  changes the situation communicatively: A, rather than biting B, barks or  growls; rather than running away, B shows a submissive posture. The gesture  is the initial phase of an act (e.g., growling before biting) that functions to call  out a response on the part of another organism (Mead 44). Many animals,  including humans, communicate by using gestures.  But, Mead argued, humans alone also engage in significant gesture, pro- ducing a gesture that has become or functions as a sign. Such a sign, as C.  S. Peirce noted, is something which stands for something to someone. For  </page> <page sequence="7"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 7 Mead, a significant gesture is still the initial phase of a developing act, but  now it means or stands for the later phase. This grants the gesture objective  standing for others and the self or gesturer as a part of the environment,  whereas for the nonhuman animal, the gesture is “invisible to the gesturer,  as it were, because it is merely part of his or her physiological or neurological  state” (Baeten). Mead explains the way the sign means with the example of  coming upon a bear’s fresh “footprints” in the woods. A dog sniffing the print  feels fear, in effect is afraid of the footprint. The human fears the footprints’  cause. That is, the human thinks the sign “bear,” which calls up a host of  aspects of the bear and the potential situation that play a further role in the  human’s response (Mead 120–21).  Mead’s essential contribution is his account of what is required for sig- nificant gesture to arise. Gesture as sign is only possible if A responds to its  own gesture from the perspective of B. It does so “implicitly”—we might say  “out of gear”—rather than explicitly. This also means A must regard herself  as an object from the viewpoint, or attitude, of B. Gestures become significant symbols when they implicitly arouse in an  individual making them the same response which they explicitly arouse,  or are supposed to arouse, in other individuals, the individuals to whom  they are addressed; and in all conversations of gestures within the social  process. . . . [T]he individual’s consciousness of the content and flow  of meaning involved depends upon his thus taking the attitude of the  other toward his own gestures. (Mead 47) Mead went on to analyze human play and games as the venues in which we  are trained to occupy the roles, hence standpoints, of others, and so to shift  among gestural positions, viewing the self and its gestures from the perspec- tives of multiple individuals. This eventually allows us to act in terms of a  “generalized other,” the representative of any interlocutor as such in our own  thought. All significant gestures embody perspectives that select out features of  the natural world as an organism’s environment. The status of environmental  features for perspectival acts is objective but relative to the perspective or at- titude of the actor. Mind is then the process of significant gestures, and self is  the organization of a human organism’s set of attitudes toward environment,  and toward itself from others, as expressed in significant gesture.  It is my hypothesis that Mead is basically right. Some others agree (e.g.,  Booth ). But qualifications of Mead’s view are necessary. Mead regards the  following list of attributes as unique to humans and, if not synonymous,  at least nomologically linked, so one cannot have one without the others:  </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 (a) significant gesture; (b) mind; (c) recognition of the “objective” status of a  gesture (of another or self ); (d) ability to take the perspective of the other on  the self; (e) ability to cognize meanings themselves or possess or have “ideas”;  (f ) awareness of or even possession of a self; and (g) the ability to produce and  consume, or act in relation to the meaning of, cultural objects or activities.  This list is the right place to look, but there are at least two problems with it.  The first is basic: there is no reason to restrict mind (or consciousness,  which is not the same thing) to humans. We cannot engage the problems of  philosophy of mind here, but we need at least a preliminary definition. Let  us say that mind is a suite of intentional activities, with intentional contents,  canonically listed as perception, memory, emotion, will, thought, imagina- tion, and consciousness, and the activity of processing or inter-relating their  contents. A mind is an integrated subset of those activities performed by an  organism; not all of them are required for a mind to be active or present.  Whatever other physiological or environmental conditions are necessary for  mind, I assume a brain and central nervous system, and perhaps some specific  brain structures, are necessary.  Ethologists routinely ascribe mind and consciousness to many nonhuman  animals. And with good reason: wherever we find nonhumans exhibiting be- havioral and neurological similarities to mind-implying behavior in humans,  we have at least prima facie reason to ascribe mind to those nonhumans. To  assert nonhuman mind is to say, with Fesmire, that humans are “not alone on  the third plateau” (Fesmire). Fesmire notes that John Dewey accepted Aristo- tle’s tripartite qualitative distinction of three kinds of life: vegetative, animal,  and human.10 Dewey connected mind to communication and denied both to  nonhumans. Mead, like Dewey, restricts mind to Aristotle’s “third” plateau.  Fesmire is right that Mead and Dewey were very likely wrong. Contrary to  Fesmire, however, whether we and nonhumans are on the same plateau de- pends on how many plateaus there are. That humans and nonhumans exhibit  mind does not erase the human-nonhuman difference if there are different  kinds of minds, or to continue the analogy, more than three plateaus.  The second problem is more subtle, and it will take the rest of this paper  to address it. Is significant gesture uniquely human? Determining the dif- ference between a nonhuman social organism emitting and responding to a  communicative gesture, and its treating that gesture as a sign in Mead’s sense,  is not easy to discern. However, today it certainly appears that a few primates  (e.g., at least Washoe, Koko, and Kanzi, cf. note 8), while not having the ca- pacity to engage in significant gesture in the wild, have acquired significant  gesture through human training. If this is true, and if one does not (as I do  </page> <page sequence="9"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 9 not) conclude that those apes thereby became mentally, cognitively, or lin- guistically indistinguishable from humans, then Mead’s significant gestures  are by themselves insufficient to distinguish the human, and their relation  to the other entries on the above list is more complex than he allowed. We  will return to this. Joint Attention Mead’s analysis is echoed in recent work on mind-reading in both comparative  ethology and human development. Tomasello, in his studies on nonhuman  and human primates, and Peter Hobson, in his studies on human autism,  separately track the development of the ability to take the perspective of  others in the form of the early childhood phenomenon of “joint attention.”  Both refer to Mead.  They point out that in the first few months of life, the normal human  infant is frequently drawn into dyadic, affect-laden, facially mimicking proto- conversations with adults. This presupposes a biological-emotional tie to a  caregiver. Emotion and cognition develop together in the “musical” rhythm  of the proto-conversation, where the infant finds that another’s attitude and  act answer its own. Nonhuman primates do not engage in this intense face-to- face relating; among primates it is new with us (or earlier hominins). Indeed,  failure of the proto-conversation, for example due to non-responsiveness or  “still face” of the caregiver, has been shown to generate problems for the infant.  Through a series of studies over the last four decades, Tronick and others have  analyzed early infant-caregiver interactions in minute detail, involving both  normal and depressed and pathogenic caretakers (see, e.g., Tronick). Failure  of caregiver responsiveness is immediately noticed by very young infants,  and they respond with changes in behavior. There seems to be a genetically  inherited pattern of facial communicative action-pause-response in infant  behavior. In his “Mutual Regulation Model,” Tronick argues the physical  and emotional homeostasis of the infant can only be managed dyadically,  that is, socially, leading to what he calls “dyadic states of consciousness.” Just  as we know that humans are uniquely “neotenic,” or born in an unusually  caretaker-dependent state that lasts for years, we seem genetically constructed  to require social interaction even to maintain our internal state within toler- able parameters, at least during infancy.  Then at nine-to-twelve months, human infants begin to interact triadi- cally in events of jointly attending to some object.11 The adult introduces a  toy. The child looks where the adult looks; acts on objects the way the adult  </page> <page sequence="10"> 10 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 acts on them and toward the same goal; engages in dialogical “turn-taking”  in collaboration or vocalization; uses “declarative” (rather than imperative)  deictic gestures like pointing and holding objects up to be seen or handed off;  attributes to the other an intended goal along with differentiation of means  from goal, hence recognizing alternative choices of means as intermediaries;  and engages in “role reversal” imitation, using symbolic objects toward the  adult as they have been used by the adult toward the child.  In this process, which is not observed in wild nonhumans, we witness the  infant gaining the ability to take the perspective, which includes the attitude,  of the other. When the caregiver introduces an initially distressing object— say, a wind-up monkey toy—the child first looks worried, then looks at the  caretaker. She smiles, amusedly handling the toy, exhibiting her attitude of  enjoyment rather than fear. Then the child smiles and handles the toy it- self. The object has become acceptable by virtue of the child’s taking up the  caretaker’s attitude toward the object, which of course requires first that the  child “read” the attitude of the caretaker. Hobson calls this early identification  and transference of attitude the “Copernican Revolution” of human mental- ity (Hobson 73). Some of the objects of joint attention become, Tomasello  adds, “communicative devices” loaded with “communicative intentions.”  Eventually jointly attended objects come to be recognized in play as a single  entity that can have multiple meanings for self and other. Joint attention is  the beginning of shared intentionality, which Tomasello conceives through  the empathy model. He suggests that the human child is hardwired to be  motivated to engage in these activities; joint collaboration is certainly affect- laden and pleasurable. While nonhuman primates are capable of a limited  form of mind-reading, such as attributing perception or knowledge and goals  to another, he argues that shared intentionality is uniquely human.  Recent neuroscience has shown just how “hard-wired” such mind-reading  may be. While we undoubtedly make inferences using concepts or “theories”  of the other’s mental contents, the fortunes of the simulation or empathy  hypothesis have been recently bolstered by the discovery of mirror neurons.  When observing an act or a facial expression, neurons in the areas of the ob- server’s brain that would fire if the observer enacted the expression herself,  become excited. When I hear or see evidence of a mental state in another, my  brain re-enacts that state in an out-of-gear sense. So there is a scientifically  recognized neurology of an internal modeling of the observed dispositions of  others. Doubtless, social learning and inferencing contribute to the growing  child’s ability to explain behavior, but mirror neurons appear to be central to  what will eventually become a normal, mind-reading human individual. It  </page> <page sequence="11"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 11 seems that, as Karsten Stueber remarks, “Nature does not have the problem  of other minds” (Stueber 142).  Returning to joint attention, we can depict it using a diagram of Hob- son’s, reproduced below with my modifications (Fig. 1). As Hobson pointed  out, in the infant-other-object relation the infant and other each attend to  an object (A, F), to each other (B, C), and the child reads and attends to the  other’s attitude toward the object (D). (Hobson’s original diagram consists  of my lines labeled A, D, F, with one double-headed arrow in place of my B  and C. His arrows are unlettered.) The infant also attends to how the other  attends to itself (E), and the other attends to how the child attends to itself  (H) and to the object (G). (The other’s attentions are dotted arrows, the  child’s solid.) The result is the child adopts the other’s attitude (F) toward the  object. This three-cornered relationship may be called the intentional triangle.  Let us analyze these relationships a bit more. To attain or incorporate  the perspective of the other, the child does not see the object as it would  from the other’s position in space; described through the empathy model of  mind-reading, it must be able to recognize the other’s attitude and imitate  or generate and hold that attitude within its experience while not ceasing  to have its own experience. Particularly, the child must hold in one act of  awareness, or switch quickly between, attention to: the object (A); the other  (B); the other’s attitude toward the object (F); and presumably the other’s  attitude toward the child (C). Taking this complex from the child’s point  of view, given an environment charged by the other’s cognitive-emotional  enabling presence (C, G, H): A plus B seems to be the basis or initiation of  Fig. 1. Intentional Triangle. Modified from Peter Hobson, The Cradle of Thought: Exploring the Origins of Think- ing (London: Pan Macmillan, 2004), 107, Fig. 2. </page> <page sequence="12"> 12 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 the experience; but then the child’s D, perhaps with the help of E, allows  the child to incorporate F either into A or along with A as an alternative to it.  Hence, given the other’s enablement, (A,B) + (D,E) → (F + A).  From eighteen to twenty-four months, symbolic play develops simulta- neous with early language. The child can pretend, say, a spoon is a car. This  means the child can hold both meanings (car, spoon) together and begin to  name them. Words serve as signs—communicative devices—for perspectival  selections of objects and object-features and an attitude toward them. Calling  a hat a “hat” is to take one of the attitudes toward it that pick it out; pretend- ing it is a “house” is to take another. Pretending cannot happen unless the  child can distinguish its perceptions from the play-meaning; if not, the spoon  would really be a car, which is a mistake or a delusion. Also, the meaning of  the word has to be “reversible,” as Hobson says, the same for the child and  the other. We will see that Hobson considers this the beginning of thinking.  Eventually, at four years—as most agree—the child is able to ascribe  mistaken beliefs to the other’s mind, as well as make distinctions between  appearance and reality. The latter, Hobson suggests, is a generalization of the  perspective of others, the perspective anyone would take if he or she were  in the right position to judge, the perspective that trumps others (Hobson  146). The child’s cognitive and sign-manipulative ability, coupled with the  fuller learning of language, eventually makes it part of that uniquely human  product, what Tomasello calls “cumulative cultural evolution,” systematic  teaching of the young and hence accumulated cultural learning over mul- tiple generations.  Reviewing development up to twenty-four months, we can distinguish  four apparent, mutually implicated achievements (not in temporal order).  First is recognition of the other’s attitude, or attribution of an attitude to the  other, presumably through an empathetic internal modeling of the other’s  perspective, holding it along with its own, despite the difference between  them. For the child at any moment already has an attitude of its own, so to  recognize the other’s as the other’s, it must model that attitude while hold- ing it distinct from its own attitude. Second is the incorporation of the other’s  apparent attitude toward something into self, or “taking on” the attitude of the  other on some external object or on the environment, for example, when the  child takes on the caregiver’s amused attitude toward the toy. Philosophers  since Wittgenstein have written of “seeing-as,” that is, alternately seeing an  intentionally ambiguous drawing as a duck or a rabbit (Wittgenstein). The  current point is that there must be joint seeing-as. Third, this can hold as well  for an act of the child, when the child takes the other’s attitude toward its  </page> <page sequence="13"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 13 own act, hence a gesture taken to mean the same for other and self at the same  time. These are Mead’s significant gestures, loaded with Tomasello’s “com- municative intentions,” in short, something functioning as a sign. Fourth,  all this implies or enables an object, including the other and the self, to be  recognized as a single entity capable of multiple jointly recognized meanings. The  spoon can be a spoon in one perspective, a car in another, manipulated in  terms of its meanings, re-created or awarded novel roles by an agent and/or  other, while not losing its common objective status as a spoon. Likewise self  and other are each single entities capable of multiple jointly recognized roles  and perspectives—for example, playing mom or dad or doctor—while yet  remaining the same object.  Mead’s notion that human mentality emerges from the ability to take up  the standpoint of the other coheres with this account. There seems to be a  distinctive human form of mentation that does not merely involve or require  communication in the coordination of activity, but is itself communicative.  The human brain, coupled with caretaker interaction and culturally inherited  language, has managed to socialize animal intentionality. Nonhumans com- municate, of course, and are often social; wherever social membership and  conspecific communication makes a difference in the individual organism’s  behavior, we can say the organism or species is social in a significant sense.  Certainly maternal care before weaning carries social learning with it. But  the way humans are social appears to be novel. Not only does the individual  communicate with gestures, as many species do, or depend on the group for  survival and satisfaction, as some do, or spend much of its time concerned  with social others and their troop relations, as a few do; the human indi- vidual’s very thought process and self are social and hence communicative.  For the others are in my head, part of the constitution of my psyche, as well as  present in my public practices. My mind represents them, and I incorporate  and think from their perspectives, take on their roles, converse with them  internally, and exchange signs with them that arouse the same response in  myself, a self that emerges out of my relations to them.  It is not difficult to see that this account touches on a variety of the candi- date core human capacities mentioned earlier. To attend to one’s body, behavior,  and attitude from the perspective of another, to merge this with or relate it to  one’s own experience of one’s body, feelings, images, and thoughts, and to dis- tinguish multiple roles potentially taken by, or perspectives on, one’s body and  behavior, is to achieve what neurologist Antonio Damasio calls “extended” or  autobiographical consciousness (Damasio). Damasio distinguishes three kinds or  levels of consciousness. First is a minimal or “proto” consciousness that grows  </page> <page sequence="14"> 14 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 out of and accompanies the automatic neurological and chemical monitoring of  the body’s internal state, generating basic feelings (e.g., excitation, fear, hunger).  Second for Damasio is “core consciousness,” a second-order mapping of the  feelings of proto-consciousness in relation to objects and processes perceived  in the environment. The crucial achievement here is the construction of an  integrated, ongoing representation of world and soma involving perception,  memory, and emotion, all linked to action. It provides “images” (although  not only visual ones—perhaps “schema” would be a better term). Both forms  of consciousness seem to be present in neurologically sophisticated animals.  Last of Damasio’s levels is extended consciousness. This is a third-order rep- resentation of the processing of the first two levels as an activity of the agent,  as “owned.” Core consciousness’s representation becomes an autobiographical  narrative centered on the self. Here is where language, inference or reasoning,  long-term and working memory, and greatly enhanced imagination reside. It  is this that humans usually call consciousness, in Damasio’s terms, the “self- in-the-act-of-knowing,” which requires that the self own its narrative history.  It is a distinctive mental module, for it can be turned off by brain damage or  disease or be absent because of developmental problems, while the minded  human still functions with respect to core and proto-consciousness.  As noted, humans seem to have a unique kind of agency. Doubtless te- leological behavior, action guided by ends-in-view, is not restricted to human  beings. The fear of the predator, desire for food or mate, coupled with the  perceptual image of any one of these can lead behavior in the nonhuman ani- mal. But there is a different, more complex level of human action. Whatever  else the self is, in the context of social communication it understands itself  as an object and, as Damasio says, narrates to itself that identity over time as  possessor of its experience and responsible for its acts. As self-conscious we  carry a cumulative history from the past into the next act, all as ours, and  anticipate a welter of different, fragmentary possible futures. To ascribe an  act to such an agent is to say it manifests the disposition and choice of the  actor, as something done and not merely undergone, hence as the agent’s  responsibility. It seems we cannot morally blame or praise the conduct of an  organism that is not an autobiographical agent. The concept of freedom is far  too complex to be discussed here, but we can at least say that part of the folk  notion of freedom in human society is the condition of being a responsible  agent making choices. We can have the latitude for such choice only if we  can imagine alternative possible doings, multiple perspectives, and multiple  roles. The social morality of such choices depends on, as Mead put it, taking  the perspective of the “generalized other.” </page> <page sequence="15"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 15  It is perhaps unnecessary to make an argument that taking the perspec- tive of the other is necessary to our unique cognitive abilities, technologies, and  reasoning, all of which are rooted in our distinctive form of social communica- tion. We are able to regard things from multiple perspectives, and to dialogue  about things independent of any one perspective. A community of linguisti- cally enabled inquirers capable of multiple perspectives is perhaps the greatest  mechanism for learning on Earth. Presumably this is as well crucial to our  tool-making, not only because such has probably always been a cooperative,  communicative endeavor, but because, as Dewey argued, objective knowledge  of natural processes and instrumentality are linked (Dewey). We must analyze  how processes take place, and how parts combine to make wholes, in order  to decompose and recombine materials into technological enhancements of  our native manual and sensory abilities, mimicking natural processes in the  process. Connected to both inter-subjective cognition and agency is our abil- ity to act on the basis of, and justify beliefs with, reasons, prospectively public  statements of belief-and-desire states, and of the conformity of those states  to publicly understood rules of possible actions. Reasons and reasoning are  developed through the identification with others and the social need com- municatively to justify action before the perspective of the generalized other.  Taking the perspective of the other is clearly central to the use of signs,  both in language and more broadly in culture. The human agent uses social,  conventional linguistic signs in communication and creates, and lives in  relation to, an artificial environment of practices, artifacts, and narratives  that carry meaning for social members, none of which could be created or  interpreted without incorporating the perspective of the other. But language  and culture suggest a deeper and more speculative hypothesis about what the  ability to take the perspective of the other enables humans uniquely to do. Meanings The further hypothesis is that humans uniquely have the ability to treat and  manipulate meanings as objects, and this ability is dependent on the capacity  to take the perspective of the other, as described above. An adequate justi- fication of this hypothesis would require addressing a host of issues in the  philosophy of language, mind, and metaphysics. My present aim is only to  suggest the broader significance of the above account.  We may begin with one of the most difficult topics: thinking. Some  use “thinking” to refer to any mental state or process whatsoever. But using  “mental processing” for the relating of mental states and contents in general,  </page> <page sequence="16"> 16 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 which must be possible for neurologically sophisticated nonhuman species,  allows us to reserve “thinking” and “thought” for something narrower. Some  ascribe “having” an idea or concept to any animal behaving in a regular way  toward selected objects—for example, a type of food. But this would apply  very widely across species, including un-encephalized invertebrates. Behaving  in rule-governed ways or integrating mental contents from different percep- tual, or memorial, sources need not demonstrate or resemble anything like  the thinking we ascribe to humans.  It is true that sophisticated nonhuman animals perform many of the same  mental functions as we do; they perceive, learn, remember, emote, cognize  bounded equivalence classes or categories of objects and conspecifics, com- municate subtle social cues, even imagine.12 As noted, those who both ex- hibit behavior strongly analogous to our minded, or intentionality-implying,  behavior, and possess comparable neurological structures are presumptively  having mental intentions or experiences. In Damasio’s terms, they appear at  least to possess core consciousness of feelings and images. If so, such animals  must mentally process—that is, relate and integrate—a welter of feelings,  perceptions, and memories; the scent of food, the memory of a predator seen  earlier, hunger, and fear must be brought decisively into relation in the act.  But this mental processing need not be what humans call “thinking” nor  “having ideas.”  A discussion of Hobson’s is relevant here. He describes a bout of his own  thinking: while looking out the window, he remembers images and facts and  feelings, anticipating future possible happenings, considers an event from one  perspective or in one connection, then another, then another, all while per- ceiving the scene in his study and out the window. Hobson is having a series  of intentional contents, some imagistic and concrete, many non-analogical,  all perspectival renditions of or about some feature(s) of things (including  himself ) that occasion further judgment. He describes this as an internal  conversation among various shifting perspectives on a variety of memories,  perceptions, and anticipations. In this he follows Mead, who saw thinking  as an internal or “reflexive” conversation among the perspectives the human  mind is able to invoke (Mead 141–48, 191–92). Reflexive conversation inter- nalizes the roles and perspectives of others, and with it, the varied aspects  of objects and states of affairs that are objects of attention. Mary Warnock  suggested that “the possibility of taking up different perspectives is essential  . . . to having a thought about something” (Warnock 171). For Tomasello,  as actual or potential objects of joint attention and communication, all our  experiences can serve as the point from which other features of reality can be  </page> <page sequence="17"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 17 judged. Human thinking seems to require the ability to call up the sense of  something not present as well as the development of a self, since for Hobson,  the self arises as an entertainer of perspectives: “A person needs a self in order  to think,” he suggests (Hobson 206).  If this is plausible, then we can distinguish the kind of “thinking” and  “having ideas” we ascribe to humans from the broader mental processing  and integration of contents that must occur among nonhumans (and in our- selves) in at least three ways. First, what humans mean by “having” a thought  or idea is not mere rule-governed behavioral responses, nor the sheer pres- ence of mental experience, nor the integration of mental contents, but the  discrimination and at least short-term preservation or “holding” of a mental  content, even without a continuous perceptual stimulus. This may depend  on autobiographical self-consciousness, which makes it possible to select  and hold a moment, phase, or constituent of the process of core conscious  experiencing, which is after all a constituent of self, as an object for atten- tion. The human, unlike the nonhuman mind, may not only be able to have  flowing experiences of core consciousness, but also to manipulate moments  and constituents of that experience and hold them in attention apart from  other ongoing perceptions. Second, humans possess a unique technology for  doing this: signs or significant gestures, the most prominent system of which  is natural language. The labeling of phases and constituents of experience by a  sign seems to be crucial to their discrimination and manipulation. (This holds  true even if some nonhumans can acquire a limited amount of significant  gesture from human training, as we will see below.) Third, if thinking is a  conversation among perspectives drawn from joint intentionality, nonhumans  may simply not have a multiplicity of perspectives from which to draw an  internal conversation. Autobiographical consciousness and the discrimina- tion of phases and constituents of experience may require the ability serially  to adopt multiple perspectives, which hangs on mind-reading and the ability  to take on the “read” perspectives of others. The nonhuman mind, without  joint intentionality, may not be able to incorporate and entertain enough  perspectives to conduct that internal conversation we call “thinking.”  We can put this in terms of meaning. A theory of meaning adequate for  the philosophy of language cannot be provided here. Nevertheless, however  else the meaning of a gesture, word, or entity ought to be conceived, it in- cludes that thing’s possible function or role in some context. If possibilities are  traits of a thing or type or collection of things, a meaning can be understood  as a perspectivally selected subset of such possible functioning. Things in the  world have traits, among which are possibilities; the spoon in the drawer is  </page> <page sequence="18"> 18 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 actually hard, shiny, and silver, but it has the possibility of being an eating  utensil, or being a pretend car, or being bent. There are some invariances  among sets of possibilities of individual things and sets of things, consistent  sets of possibilities in some context or situation. A meaning can be under- stood as a perspectivally selected, consistent or rule-governed set of some of  those possibilities. (“Rule-governed” implies the selected possibilities must  be consistent; if inconsistent, they are not part of one meaning.) When social  communication picks out and manipulates such coherent sets of possibilities,  they are meanings. Meanings are thus “objective” in the sense that the pos- sibilities of which they are a subset may obtain independently of the agent,  but their selection and collection into a meaning is relative to the agent’s  perspectival activity. As Mead notes, an apple is, or can be, food. What en- ables it to be such are its characteristics, including its chemical properties,  which are independent of the existence of other creatures. However, it only  acquires the characteristic or meaning “food” if there exist living beings who  do or can eat it; and that meaning is independent of what anyone “thinks”  about it. The bearer of a meaning in communication is a sign. Signs are things  specifically utilized as tools by social communication, and habitually granted  particular meaning, whether verbal or nonverbal. Because the communication  is social, it is equally true to say that its meanings are emergent upon social  communication as upon sign use. Semantic externalism is justified here, for  while my having a meaning in thought or speech is not public, the meaning  thereby had is. That is the lesson of Dewey, Wittgenstein, and the last half- century of philosophy of language.  Many animals with complex brains must deal with possibilities and hence  with meanings in some sense. The remembered, now possible event is crucial  to recognize—for example, wariness in entering an area where a predator was  seen the day before, the growl that indicates a possible attack, etc. Natural  kinds are one set of possibilities that matter particularly—the deer must  beware not only of the particular coyote seen yesterday, but also this darker- colored, smaller version today, while not fearing a raccoon. But even in these  cases, the nonhuman seems to be generalizing a retained response, the basis  of which is an instinct or fixed action pattern—that is, fear of the tokens  of “coyote,” now generalized. The list of possibilities that matter, hence are  responded to, is very limited; what might be food, what might be a coming  storm, what might be a predator, what might be a mate. It appears the lim- ited number of relevant possibilities is small enough to be handled without  a complex representational device, for example, mental representation of sets  of possibilities as meanings. </page> <page sequence="19"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 19  So while there are doubtless nonhumans who must respond to some of  the meanings of events, to respond to the events as having meaning, we alone  have the means and capacity to represent and attend to the meanings them- selves, hence to consider and manipulate possible meanings. Our uniquely  componential, syntactically constructed, and recursive languages present the  clearest example.13 Every word, sentence, gesture, and speech act we utter is  shot through with possibilities. Each refers partly to things and events that  are not present. As a result, we can attend to, consider, and respond to what  is not present systematically. Meaning manipulation allows us to do some- thing remarkable, to objectify and communicate about what is non-actual,  and thus be able to communicate about the actual through, or in the context  of, the non-actual or non-present. All of which grants our unique latitude  of action or behavior. For Mead, “The [human] mind holds on to . . . dif- ferent possibilities of response . . . and it is [this] ability to hold them there  that constitutes his mind” (Mead 135). This is, I think, roughly correct, with  the exceptions that there are animal minds that can and must hold some  possibilities, and that human core and proto-conscious mind can be present  without this level of “mind.” It appears humans alone can occupy a “we”  perspective that is coordinated with and includes an “I” that, along with the  representational device of linguistic signs, allows action to be to some extent  controlled by a systematic consideration of meanings, hence possibilities.  Now we can return briefly to the role of significant gesture. It appears  that significant gesture, which for Mead requires the ability of the gesturer  to take the perspective of others on the gesture, can to a limited extent be ac- quired by some individual nonhuman great apes (e.g., Washoe, Kanzi, Koko;  cf. note 8). Some nonhumans have the neuro-mental-behavioral capacity to  acquire use of some significant gesture. So this is evidently possible without  being, or “becoming,” human, which is to say, behaviorally indistinguish- able from, for example, a five-year-old speech-impaired human who has been  taught sign language.  What implications does this have for the use of Mead’s account as a hy- pothesis for a core part of human distinctiveness? First, we must remember  that, since Washoe et al. acquired this ability through human training, it  remains the case that significant gesture seems only to exist in the context of  human society. It would not be odd, for Mead or us, to regard significant gesture  as primarily—in logical and temporal terms—a social rather than individual  possession. Second, the linguistic behavior of Washoe et al. does imply that  a distinction must be drawn between the acquisition of some significant ges- ture, which means a relatively small number of signs and the ability to take  </page> <page sequence="20"> 20 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 the perspective of others on those gestures, and an ongoing, systematic, open- ended use of significant gesture. In terms of the current account, this would  mean achieving the perspective of others on some acts is not tantamount to  living in and experiencing the world through the intentional triangle. It may  be significant gesture should be seen as a means or vehicle of communication  that may help to stimulate the intentional triangle, and in which it later plays  a crucial role, but evidently can exist without it. That is, the learning of a  relatively limited set of significant gestures, gestures treated and experienced  as signs, including linguistic signs, is possible without the systematic use of  such signs and ongoing occupation of the perspective of others and generalized  other that emerges in human childhood. Once “in” the triangle, some usages  of significant gesture become uniquely human. What seems special to humans  is the ability to function in the triangle, as a kind of platform (or “plateau” in  Fesmire’s sense), a systematic mode of experience and behavior. Culture The most encompassing mode of signification within which humans uniquely  function by perspective-taking is culture. Human beings uniquely create an  artificial environment out of signs. Many species to some extent construct  environments for themselves, from anthills to beaver ponds. But only humans  construct an environment out of things that mean.  Some claim culture is not uniquely human. There are other species that  manifest unique group practices, versus species-wide behavior, passed across  generations via learning rather than genetic inheritance. One of the most  famous cases is a troop of Koshima macaques, who alone among their spe- cies wash their sweet potatoes before eating them. (The sweet potatoes were  actually a gift of human researchers, and it took two years for the behavior  to spread throughout the troop [Tomasello 26–31].) This is sometimes called  “culture.” But we must distinguish culture from society (Cahoone). If not,  we would have to say any social change is a cultural change and vice versa,  and deny that one can change independently of the other (not to mention we  would have to deny the existence of “multicultural” societies). Societies can  be defined as extended, stable groups of conspecifics for whom membership  makes a difference to individual behavior. Society is a horizon of interaction  and interdependence, requiring communication and rules of behavioral pro- priety and intelligibility. Cultures are horizons of meanings and ends, more  specifically, the collection of practices, narratives, and artifacts that constitute  the mediate significance of acts. The kind of communication uniquely used in  </page> <page sequence="21"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 21 cultural practices, for example rituals, is typically quite different from everyday  social communication (Dunbar, Knight, and Power). Human societies have,  but are not, cultures. The two overlap and interact, but are not the same.  A macaque troop is a society. When it acquires potato washing, its society  has indeed changed and it has passed on social learning across generations.  Evidently there are some nonhuman species capable of this. Human societies  change in this way as well. But human societies also have cultures, which is to  say they make things that mean. Cultural objects, whether artifacts, narratives,  or practices, exist and endure as meaning-endowed material entities or human  activities or both. One may say, following Margolis, that cultural phenomena  are real, intentional or meaningful entities, processes, structures, or proper- ties, “emergent” upon or “embodied” in physical or biological phenomena  (Margolis 134–41). In addition to their material properties as constructions  or performances, they have meaning-properties independent of their enjoy- ment or creation, like many other sets of possibilities. They are communicative  things, things carrying—and objectively created to carry—meanings, which  play the role of expressing and coordinating human judgments in a society.  And crucially, cultures are inter-generational; they outlast individuals.  We know that this ability to create and generationally transmit meaning- carrying practices, narratives, and artifacts, hence information and resources  for social life, is an enormous alteration of biological evolution (Lorenz). All  life evolves by environmental selection of genetically based or influenced  phenotypic features (among other factors). But humans alone are also sys- tematically Lamarckian, inheriting acquired or learned characteristics via  stored public signs, artifacts, and practices designed for that purpose. This  does not mean biology or nature has been transcended. It means that we are  the only species on Earth (unless this was also true of Neanderthals or other  hominins) systematically to augment natural selection in this way. Culture is  the way “modern” Homo sapiens lives in nature.14 Just as nonhuman nature  contains structures, processes, possibilities, pasts, purposes, behavior, learning,  experiences, and communication, in the human case it also contains cultural  signs, languages, meanings, ideas, art, rituals, narratives, and religions. All  these exist, in fact they interact, and the current state of local Earthly nature  cannot be understood without recognizing that they do (e.g., current global  warming appears to be at least partly a cultural product).  In conclusion, we can summarize this broader account of the human  difference in an expanded version of the intentional triangle (or, if the cen- ter of the triangle is seen as rising out of the page, a tetrahedron) (Fig. 2).  It represents the relation between self-consciousness, taking the perspective  </page> <page sequence="22"> 22 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013 Fig. 2. Expanded Intentional Triangle. of others, joint attention to objects/events in the world, and the ability to  use special objects/acts as cultural signs. These four capacities are linked  and together provide the resources for most of the core features that make  humans distinct, like language, reason-giving, responsible agency, discursive  cognition, inquiry, and cumulative cultural evolution. Each of these core  features doubtless requires other genotypic, phenotypic, and environmental  conditions. I do not mean that all human mental functioning occurs at this  level; we also operate on the levels of Damasio’s core consciousness and proto- consciousness. But it appears that several sources of information, starting with  Mead, are currently converging on the notion that the core phenomena of  human distinctiveness emerge in the space of the intentional triangle. notes  1. The notion that human domination of nonhuman nature is correlated with op- pression within human society of humans culturally regarded as representing nature was  first formulated by the Frankfurt School, later employed in a different form by French  post-structuralism. It is interesting but by no means obviously true. It does not seem that  human social oppression is a necessary or sufficient condition for domination of nature,  or vice versa. </page> <page sequence="23"> cahoone : Mead, Joint Attention, and the Human Difference 23  2. Booth, in summarizing Fouts’s view, writes that “[a]nthropomorphism is also im- portant for practical ethics: the more we see apes as being like us, the more likely we will  be to support efforts to improve their conditions” (Booth 26). Perhaps this statement was  intended to reflect the view of Roger Fouts, to which Booth’s piece is partly a response.  3. Note that even the classic statements of ethical treatment of animals do not claim  either that a nonhuman animal has in principle as much moral value as (Singer) or the  same rights (or rights to the same things) as a human being (Regan). They have value  or rights, not equal value or rights, and those must be un-prejudicially weighed in the  balance with human values or rights. To put it practically: neither of them claims that if  forced to choose whether to save one of my children or two cats from a burning building,  I ought to save the two cats.  4. McKenna refers to Mary Midgley’s recognition that some nonhumans extend such  courtesies, for example, racehorses sometimes establish social and apparently emotional  relations with goats or cats (McKenna 40). But how many wild, as opposed to domesti- cated, examples are there? Cooperation or “symbiotic” behavior among species, in which  each benefits the other, is not unusual, but a cross-species social bond is quite another  thing.  5. This is not least true because whoever grants moral value to nonhumans must distin- guish nonhuman species as to their degree of moral value and the level of moral treatment  and respect they are owed by us, that is, which nonhumans are to be treated how. This  requirement is not merely theoretical but practical. Generally speaking, the “lower” we  go on the phylogenetic scale, the more widespread the type of organism and the more  difficult it is not to “exploit” or harm it. It is plausible to comply with the demand that  we cease to exploit or harm chimpanzees, but very hard to imagine ceasing to exploit or  harm invertebrates (Fouts and McKenna).  6. The species concept remains controversial. The “biological” conception of a spe- cies as a reproductively isolated interbreeding population applies only to sexual species  (Mayr 166). And there are ongoing questions regarding many biological forms about  what constitutes a species versus a subspecies or population.  7. Homo neanderthalensis evolved, perhaps from erectus, a million years before Homo  sapiens and had a slightly larger brain mass-to-body mass ratio than we do. It is possible  that we humans and Neanderthals interbred. If we did, then technically we are subspe- cies of one species. See Finlayson.  8. A number of domesticated great apes have famously been taught some representa- tional language. Washoe, a chimpanzee, was taught some American Sign Language by  Allan and Beatrix Gardner, and later she herself tried to teach signs to a younger chimp.  (Roger and Deborah Fouts also worked with Washoe. See Fouts and Mills). The gorilla  Koko was taught sign language by Francine Patterson. The bonobo Kanzi was taught by  Sue Savage-Rumbaugh to press lexigrams on a keyboard that lit up pictures of referents.  Kanzi could even differentiate word order, for example, distinguish “make the doggie bite  the snake” from “make the snake bite the doggie” (Anderson). But prepositions, connec- tors, conjunctions, disjunctions, subordinating clauses, and embedded sentences seem  beyond Kanzi’s ability. Steven Pinker (336–40) and Cheney and Seyfarth have argued  that these cases are not comparable even to rudimentary human language use, spoken  or sign. I cannot, and do not need to, decide this question. For present purposes it is  sufficient to say at least some features of human language use are certainly unique. Just  how many are, and why, is another matter. </page> <page sequence="24"> 24 the pluralist 8 : 2 2013  9. After concluding in 1999 that nonhuman primates do not mind-read, in his later  work Tomasello qualified his view after conducting studies in which chimpanzees showed  evidence of the ability to attribute perceptions and goals to others, but not false beliefs  (Call and Tomasello; Kaminski, Call, and Tomasello). Thus for Tomasello, it is not the  complete absence of theory of mind that differentiates chimpanzee and human, but the  kind and extent of the human mind-reading ability.  10. Aristotle lacks our post-Cartesian tendency to identify mind and consciousness.  For Aristotle, mind is intellect, rationality, and language. Perception and desire, hence  consciousness of perceptual content and feeling of desire, are characteristic of the animal  level of soul or life (which we, of course, share). Aristotle’s third plateau is narrower than  mind in our modern sense.  11. While Tomasello uses the language of vision (“shared gaze”), I see no reason that  joint attention could not arise where touch and/or hearing are substituted for vision,  just as I see no reason signed-language could not substitute for spoken-heard language.  Of course, whether that is true is a matter for empirical studies.  12. The insight learning of orangutans and others implies rudimentary imagination,  so it seems there must be imagining without language (Cheney and Seyfarth 270–72).  13. My claim is not that we can mean only possibilities; we certainly can mean actualities  too. But words refer to actualities through universals, hence possibilities. The particular  wall is actual and actually white, but both wall and whiteness are classes of possibilities  through which I understand the actual particular. “Cahoone the philosopher” refers to  me. “Cahoone” is a name or rigid designator, but “the” is an article whose meaning is a  set of possibilities, and “philosopher” is a kind, again a set of possibilities.  14. The caveat “modern” refers to humans since 50 thousand years ago, before which we  have little or no evidence of artifactual culture. Cultural narratives and practices, which  may or may not have existed before that, leave no archaeological trace. references Anderson, Stephen R. “A Telling Difference.” Natural History Nov. 2004: 38–43.
