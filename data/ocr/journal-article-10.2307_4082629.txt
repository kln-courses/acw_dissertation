<plain_text><page sequence="1">Birds in the sun.-Malcolm MacDonald. Photographs by Christina Loke. 1962. London, H. F. &amp; G. Witherby, Ltd. 128 pp., 49 color pls., 6 black-and-white photos. 111/2 X 83/4 in. 48 shillings.-Readers of books and periodicals dealing with North American and European birds have become rather sophisticated about bird photog- raphy in recent years. Only a really striking picture, if the subject is a common species, will make us sit up and take notice. It must be admitted, therefore, that at least some of the initial fascination of Christina Loke's photographs in this hand- some new book is based on the unfamiliarity to us of her subjects. Upon second thought, however, we realize that certain of the photographs are so brilliantly com- posed, or catch the bird so neatly in action, that we would exclaim over them if their subjects were catbirds and flickers instead of tailor-birds and barbets. This is unashamedly a picture book; Malcolm MacDonald's text consists of a few pages of introduction and acknowledgments, and a page or two of observations from his own experience about each of the Indian species portrayed. His style is lively and informal, not infrequently verging on the anthropomorphic (as he is fully aware), but without being offensive. Christina Loke, whose husband Loke Wan Tho is also a world-famous bird pho- tographer, is ranked by Roger Tory Peterson in a dust-jacket blurb as ". . . ahead of any other female bird photographer in the world." This reviewer believes that Dr. Peterson, ordinarily among the most gallant of gentlemen, was unnecessarily restrictive in his statement. Surely there can be but a handful of male photographers who would willingly spend hour after hour in a small blind during the peak of a Delhi summer, with air temperatures outside the blind sometimes reaching 114?F. During the first few days of the summer of 1959, when these pictures were taken, Mme. Loke's weight dropped from 104 pounds to 92 pounds. Adding to simple heat such other hazards as dust storms and monsoon rains, rickety scaffolds 40 feet high, and hordes of curious villagers, one can but wonder at the beauty of the final product. All of the photographs are not classics, of course, but their quality as a whole (and the excellence of their reproduction) makes this one of the most attractive books of bird photographs to have appeared in recent years, with the added fillip, as men- tioned above, that so many are so unfamiliar to American readers. The color plates</page><page sequence="2">Jan.] Reviews 103 illustrate 44 species, arranged in phylogenetic sequence. Only vernacular names are used in the text, but English, Hindi, and scientific names are given in the index. The only misprint noted occurs in the latter: Columba "iiaria" for Columba livia. The coated paper used is exceptionally heavy; the binding is inadequate and is already badly warped in the review copy. The reviewer cannot resist a comment on the remarkable abundance of birds in Delhi. If the well-known Hindu reverence for life is responsible for Mr. MacDonald's being able to observe no less than 15 species of diurnal birds of prey from his garden in the heart of the city, then perhaps India should send missionaries to a country in which federal legislation is necessary to reduce ("stop" is too optimistic) the slaughter of eagles, and in which 60 per cent of the states still pay bounties on predators.-KENNETH C.
