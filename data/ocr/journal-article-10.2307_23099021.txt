<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRVING DEER* Strindberg's Dream Vision: Prelude to the Film There are a great many ways in which much of the literature of the past eighty or ninety years can be (and has been) seen as prelude to the film. Akin in spirit to our own artistic vision, that literature reflects and continues to contribute to the cultural preparation essen tial for any comprehensive grasp of that vision. Eisenstein himself, although somewhat begrudgingly, saw James Joyce as a writer who attempted to break the traditional (and therefore " capitalistic") literary mold by creating an aborted cinematic technique, aborted because it was, after all, still literature and not films he was creating.1 We, too, can see in the work of Strindberg, Dostoevsky and Kafka, among that of many other writers, expressionistic, psychological and dream techniques strangely akin to the film in the fluidity they suggest about human experience, a fluidity expressive of particularly modern ideas about the dissolution of character, the possible distortions and interdependence of time and space, the strange intermingling of illusion and reality, and the breakdown of any fixed moral or spatial reference points. Such techniques are forms of accommodation to a new emerging view of the world, a view greatly influenced by the rapid develop ments in the sciences since the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Wylie Sypher is not alone in pointing out the great influence of science on contemporary art, and the accommodation of the new art of the film to a twentieth century world view grounded in a metaphysic nurtured by science.2 To some important critics and scholars, the film has indeed become the epitome of the means by which the arts have today accommodated themselves to a scientifically grounded world view, the embodiment of the aims of all of the arts in the twentieth century. Arnold Hauser has gone so far as to express the feeling that * Editor of three books on the popular arts and contemporary culture, and author of numerous articles and reviews of modern drama and fiction, Irving Deer teaches at the University of South Florida. 1 Sergei Eisenstein, Film form, ed. and trans.

These can lead from explorations into the nature of specific works of art, and of the artist's vision, to the relationships between his vision (and his works) and the contemporary world view, one which em bodies not only the latest ideas about art and the film, but also those most expressive of significant, influential current thinking in the sci ences, social sciences, and the humanities in general. The scope of possibilities is overwhelming, extending even to the discovery, explana tion and substantiation of a comprehensive contemporary world view, something far from achievement today despite the welter of attempts from every quarter. The best one can do is to begin at the beginning. This paper is an attempt at another beginning. It attempts to probe a few of the important ways in which some of the plays of one play wright, August Strindberg, show an inclination toward a cinematic conception of form. If it also suggests ways by which science helped to promote that inclination, so much the better from the standpoint of its contribution toward inspiring further research and reflection on the significant relationships between art and science today. Whatever the specifics of our world view, it is shaped as surely by science as the prehistoric was by magic, the classical by myth, and the Christian by religion. Science is our myth, our source for metaphor. Our artists and writers have for some time sensed this. Our critics and scholars are just beginning to. What complicates the situation today is that science itself has been undergoing drastic changes. Classical New tonian physics has been overthrown. Its overthrow demands a drastic reinterpretation of the whole range of human experience. Throughout most of his creative life, Strindberg was dedicated to making of his personal struggles as an artist a significant source of modern experience. His struggle to accomplish this has some startling similarities, especially in its later phases, to a similar struggle currently waged by such outstanding film artists as Antonioni, Bergman, Fellini and Kubrick. By examining several aspects of this analogous concern, we may not only shed some light on Strindberg's contemporaneity, but also on his problems and his stature. Strindberg was moving rapidly 3 The Social History of Art, Vol. IV, trans. Stanley Godman (New York, 1951), p. 239.</page><page sequence="3">Strindbergs Dream Vision 255 toward a twentieth century vision of human experience, a vision much influenced by physical science since the last decade of the nineteenth century, and implied in the principle of complementarity4 first ex plained by the physicist Neils Bohr.5 J. Robert Oppenheimer defines the term " complementarity " simply and memorably as the idea " that an electron must sometimes be considered as a wave, and sometimes as a particle." As Bohr and others have explained the implications of this principle, the smallest component of matter, the ultimate basis of physical reality must be seen sometimes as one thing and sometimes as another; both are adequate interpretations even though different.6 If physical reality can be seen only in different but equally valid ways, this implies to some philosophical minds of our scientific age the possibility that we must make an approach to experience in which " radically opposed and equally total commitments to the meaning of life coexist in a single harmonious vision." Born into the old world, Strindberg sensed impending changes and struggled with some success to accommodate himself artistically to these changes. In doing this he moved in the direction of a fluid form and discovered a new subject requiring that form, both exemplified in the work of the best film makers of our day. Preoccupied later in his life with mysticism and Eastern religions as well as science and psychology, and suffering near insanity himself, Strindberg unselfconsciously created a new dramatic form capable of directly expressing the inner turmoil he had suffered. We call this form expressionism, and accept it as a seminal twentieth century form significant not only in the theatre but in all of the visual arts. It is no 41 am not arguing that this principle is a scientific law, that it is accepted by all physicists, or even that it's known, much less understood, by most, or even many, people the way, say, some of Freud's ideas are. I am merely saying, along with Gerald Holton, that the principle of complementarity is a characteristic con ception of our age, one that gives "it its own unmistakable modernity." It's a conception that is, that marks " a turning point in the road from which our view of the intellectual landscape, in science and in other fields, will forever be qualitatively different from that of earlier periods."

The intensity of his passions, their apparent cynicism and amorality, and the strange newsness of his ideas and techniques put them outside the grasp of those oriented to a nineteenth century view of experience and art. Intensely sensitive to the intellectual and artistic cross-currents of his time, he was again and again moved to try to understand and express his extreme personal suffering in terms of them. As early as November 1877, while he was undergoing the anguish of his separation and eventual divorce from Siri, he wrote a letter to the young Swedish writer, Axel Lundegard, in which he sounds as if, in laying bare his deepest feelings and thoughts, he is expounding a theory of avant garde art, and even more amazingly, a theory of the new art form that was to develop in the twentieth century, the art of the film, and relating both to new ideas in science and philosophy. After explaining how impossible it was for a romantic to live without an ideal, and how shattered his life had become since his ideal—" incarnated in a woman " —had fallen, he went on to the crucial perceptions that were eventually to culminate in The Dream Play and his many other expressionistic works. It seems to me as though I walk in my sleep—as though reality and imagination are one ... it is as though I no longer walk the earth, but hover weightless in a space filled not with air but with darkness . . . what is curious is that in a dream which often recurs to me at night I feel that I am flying weightless, and I find this quite natural, as though all concep tions of right and wrong, true and false, had ceased to exist for me, so that everything that happens, however strange, seems inevitable. Well, I suppose this is the logical conse quence of the new philosophy of indeterminism, and perhaps it is because I am unaccustomed to this new intellectual climate that I am amazed and fearful.7 To those familiar with Susanne K. Langer's ideas on the film, the most obvious filmic idea expressed in Strindberg's letter is his con ception of experience as a dream. For as Langer tells us, this is the way in which the film presents experience. Movies are not dreams, but they are like them in important ways. Her explanation of this 'Quoted in the "Introduction to The Father" by Michael Meyer, trans. The Plays of Strindberg (New York, 1966), pp. 21-22.</page><page sequence="5">Strindberg's Dream Vision 257 point has important implications not only for an understanding of the work of our best film makers, but it bears directly on what Strindberg was doing in his expressionistic plays. As she says: The most noteworthy formal characteristic of dream is that the dreamer is always in the center of it. Places shift, persons act and speak, or change or fade—facts emerge, situations grow, objects come into view with strange importance, ordi nary things infinitely valuable or horrible, and they may be superseded by others that are related to them essentially by feeling, not by natural proximity. But the dreamer is always " there," his relation is, so to speak, equidistant from all events. Things may occur around him or unroll before his eyes; he may act or want to act, or suffer or contemplate; but the immediacy of everything in a dream is the same for him. This aesthetic peculiarity, this relation to things perceived, characterizes the dream mode-, it is this that the moving picture takes over, and whereby it creates a virtual present. In its relation to the images, actions, events, that constitute the story, the camera is in the place of the dreamer.8 With the help of these insights, we can see from Strindberg's letter that he was rapidly moving toward a filmic conception of experience. He was defining for himself what Langer calls the " dream mode a way of presenting drama that would accomplish each of the following: 1. it would make extremely subjective states objective; 2. it would be anti-solipsistic, inimical to the old conception of character as an ego committed to one fixed point of view; 3. it would emphasize things and actions in themselves, magnifying them and minimizing any concern over the motives, morals and value judgments of the protagonist involved with them. This would tend to minimize and perhaps even eliminate the use of plots, the traditional means of gaining the essentials of a structure, progression, coherence and unity. Through his plays, Strindberg reveals a growing awareness of the possibility and desirability of creating a dramatic form which accom plishes these ends. Although first attracted by the naturalistic theatre, Strindberg became more and more intensely concerned with the 8 Feeling and Form (New York, 1953), p. 413.</page><page sequence="6">258 Irving Deer validly of subjective experience. By showing " that the subject-object coupling could be cut only in an arbitrary way," the new physics and philosophy developing in the last ten or fifteen years of the century supported this concern. Science was, in other words, rejecting its former ideal of total objectivity. The observer was beginning to count. As Holton says, "What Bohr was pointing to in 1927 was the curious realization that in the atomic domain, the only way the observer (including his equipment) can be uninvolved is if he observes nothing at all." 9 With the discoveries of Neils Bohr, Werner Heisen berg and others in the first quarter of the twentieth century, this process was complete. Physics had now, in Gamow's words, become " de classicalized." The scientific observer of sub-atomic reality, no matter how painstakingly objective were his efforts, was always a partial contributor to what he saw. Moreover, if science now required two indispensable unrelated theories of light, perhaps science itself did not have a priority on reality. Just as science required different maps of reality, perhaps it was itself only one map, and art was another. The artist's struggle to transform his inner turmoil into art could thus become a legitimate chart of reality. Although at first, like Ibsen, Strindberg was attracted to naturalistic drama, to drama that is, which presents the illusion of objectivity, he sensed early in his career the necessity for taking subjective states into account, and the impending changes that were being prompted by science and philosophy. Not only did he write the letter, from which we quoted earlier, just after he had finished writing The Father, a play usually considered one of his naturalistic triumphs, but both this play, written in 1887, and his next, Miss Julie, written in 1888, contain significant and obviously subjective, expressionistic elements. Both are centrally concerned with the hypnotic spells the protagonists cast over each other. Miss Julie is brought to so high a pitch of sub jectivity that just before the end of the play, she acts and sounds as if she were a character in a purely expressionistic play. She says to Jean: I am already asleep—the whole room is like smoke around me—and you look like an iron stove—which resembles a man dressed in black, with a tall hat—and your eyes shine like coals, when the fire is dying—and your face is a white smear, like ash—10 9 Holton, p. 1018. 10 The Plays of Strindberg, pp. 160-61.</page><page sequence="7">bTRINDBERG S UREAM V XSION 259 As a glance at his many expressiorustic plays shows, Strindberg became more centrally concerned with objectifying highly subjective states. He cast whole plays in the form of dreams, many of them frankly titled as such, indicating their highly subjective form. Some times, as in The Spook Sonata, they are given the shape of grotesque, harsh nightmares with mad, bizarre characters, characters who appear (as in films) from nowhere, characters who can be seen only by one character, and not by others. Sometimes, as in the Dream Play, Strindberg's expressionistic plays are compassionate and lyrical. But here again the transitions are abrupt (analogous to cuts in a film), with scenes and details shifting according to the attitude of the character whose subjective state is being projected at the moment. borne scenes from 1 he Dream Play will illustrate Strindberg s technique. The season changes in an instant and a character is older, suddenly gray haired and weary of life. The lights go off in one part of the stage, on in another part, then off again and on back in the first place. Even the fits of light and darkness express the character's desperate sense of life's fits and starts. The objects, too, take on a lite of their own, expressive of the highly subjective states of the characters. The castle and tree change from scene to scene. The castle grows. The tree loses its leaves or gets new ones. Both express the unfulfilled natural passage of time deeply felt by both the Officer and Indra's Daughter. The door is there again and again blocking the Officer. The dipnet is there always expressing the Billposter's unfulfilled expectations. Even when objects do not grow or change as if they literally had a life of their own, like the door and the dipnet, they take on a subjective significance that amounts to the same thing. They become vivid images, ends-in-themselves, with no meaning derived from any extrinsic significance they might have. A door and i dipnet are neutral, mundane objects, ordinarily of no special signifi cance. But to the Officer and the Billposter they have great subjective significance. Like all of the details in Strindberg's dream plays, they are meant to express the inner states of his protagonists. Ultimately, of course, in so far as they are successful, they present the inner states )f the dreamer himself, the playwright's persona, the one fictive char icter in whose dream they occur. They clearly show Strindberg's ntense concern with objectifying highly subjective states—a concern ve have proclaimed as the first characteristic of an ideal film form. 1 he second and third basic characteristics of the film—the dissolution )f the old conception of character as ego-centered, and the emphasis )n things and actions in themselves—are also implicit in his work. In</page><page sequence="8">260 Irving Deer his Preface to Miss Julie, he spells out a new conception of character which denies the validity of the old conception.11 Miss Julie's char acter, he tells us, is not motivated by any single physiological or psychological motive. She is a patchwork of many motivations. Strind berg himself mentions more than a dozen, including " the chance that drove these two people together." Scientists were exchanging a statisti cal interpretation of law for the previous causal interpretation. Strind berg was doing sometimes analogous to that in his new interpretation of character and event. However, as he clearly recognizes, in providing Miss Julie with a " multiplicity of motives," he is not himself making a moral judgment of her actions. He is merely interested in her as a modern character, as he says, "living in an age of transition more urgently hysterical . . . than the age which preceded it." His " filmic" tendencies increased rapidly. More and more he stripped away externals so that he could present passionate inner states as directly as possible. More and more he became interested in people and things in themselves, not on the moral significance of their acts. He magnified objects, people and actions so that they were intensely real, although presented as if seen in a dream or hallucinatory state. Unlike Maeterlinck, he heightened and intensified the details he presented, giving them a life of their own, a separate intensity unrelated to other separate, intense details except by association. As we have seen, his castle in The Dream Play grows, has a character of its own and affects his characters as if it were one of them. The door, too, has a separate, intense significance, which by association relates to his characters. The grotesque exaggeration of the Mummy and of many of the other characters in The Spook Sonata gives each of them a supernatural vividness, a mad, nightmarish separate existence. They are joined with others only in an insane common human dance of death. The action of waiting had itself been Strindberg's inspiration for The Dream Play. He had at first conceived the play as one entirely concerned with the act of waiting as an expression of the failure of fulfillment in life, perhaps a kind of Waiting for Godot. Even in the final version of the play, the scene of the officer waiting is like one of his short chamber plays in itself. What is confusing about many of Strindberg's more realistic plays, or even about the more realistic elements of his expressionistic plays, is that he seems to be indulging in analysis and logic, the old fashioned debate techniques for which Ibsen became so famous in his social 11 Ibid., pp. 101-04.</page><page sequence="9">Strindberg s Dream V ision 261 problem plays. Motivation and plot are essential concerns in such plays. The writer of such a play is vitally interested in morally evalu ating his characters. We have seen that Strindberg is not; that, at least in his more obviously expressionistic plays, he is attempting to destroy traditional configurations based on clear, logical plots and moral evaluations of character. He is interested in intensely magnifying his incidents so that they are significant in themselves. How, then, can we account for his heavy reliance on what still looks like court room debates? The answer lies, of course, in the way in which Strindberg uses debates. Ibsen is more interested in analyzing the causes of his char acter's predicaments. Strindberg is more interested in the way in which his protagonists try to destroy each other, whether by logic or through physical force, the means being incidental. It is a matter of emphasis. I do not mean to say that Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts is merely trying to understand her predicament by explaining it to Man ders. She is also trying to extricate herself from it. But she is not really attacking Manders directly by explaining how false his ideas are about her husband. She is trying to assert reason as an ideal. The fact that she hopes it will, once established, replace the false traditions that have trapped her is beside the point. Unlike Strindberg's pro tagonists, she is not engaging through words in a direct physical assault on an adversary. Strindberg's characters are. The assault comes first, the concern with causes is only a poor second. For Ibsen the emphasis is the other way around. Like the film maker Langer describes, Strind berg is interested in seeing as directly as possible a grossly magnified view of the inner life of his characters, the fragments of their subjective explosions, not the logic of their interrelationships with others. We can see Strindberg's method clearly at work in The Dance of Death. At the beginning of the play, Alice and the Captain sit trying to get at the causes of their misery. Everything they say about their situation is true. They have no money. Their marriage was forced on them by illusion. The servants are deserting them. The Captain is growing more ill, and Alice is by now completely isolated from the company of other military wives. But in another sense, the logical causes of their predicament are of only secondary interest to them. Each seizes on the other's weaknesses as a way of destroying him. Alice does not really care that the Captain's eyes are failing. She is interested only in gloating over his weakness. The Captain does not really care that Curt is with the other officers. He cares only as a way of showing Alice that she is deserted even by her own family. Later,</page><page sequence="10">261 Irving Deer when each gets Curt alone, each tells his story more to gain help in a struggle against the other than to gain sympathy or to find objectivity or solace in his misery. The play becomes darker and darker as each becomes more isolated from the world, more wrapped up in his own hysteria. Realistic as it may seem at first, the play moves closer and closer to expressionism, to a direct presentation of a dream state. Strindbergs use of words in The Dance of Death is not unlike his use of them in so obviously expressionistic a play as The Spook Sonata. In the second scene, Hummel sits with the assembled dinner party. He asks for silence rather than conversation. Then, in the silence, almost as if he is speaking the thoughts of each man, he tells just enough of each man's past guilt to destroy that man utterly. What he is doing can no longer be called either particularly rational or analytic. It is a kind of direct, intuitive, destructive expression of the guilt each one feels. The key to Strindberg's use of language, debate-like or not, is that it functions in the same ways as the non-verbal expressionistic elements in his plays. Whether he uses words or bizarre visual effects, beginning with The Father, Strindberg is clearly concerned with directly expressing the inner states of his characters. This is why he can, to the end of his career, switch back and forth at will between obvious expressionism and apparent naturalism. It is also why he can so effectively commingle naturalistic and expressionistic elements in the same play. For him, all of his later techniques are essentially expressionistic, that is, all are used to directly reveal subjective states. Sometimes, as in the ending of Miss Julie or in his expressionistic plays, like To Damascus, The Dream Play and Spook Sonata, this is very obvious. Sometimes it is not so obvious. But even where it is not so obvious, as in The Dance of Death, as we have seen from the way in which he uses words in the play, the protagonists use words as instruments of dissection, as the means by which they cut each other up as surely as if they were using swords. Abstract as the language sounds, it is the precise act which can and does directly reveal their passionate inner states. It is on such icts which Strindberg concentrates. He is interested in them for themselves, not for their moral significance or for any significance they might have in a large configuration such as a plot or some logical scheme. He is simply interested in presenting them as intensely as possible, in transforming them into art. Each of the three tendencies Langer characterized as intrinsic to the film is, thus, also intrinsic to Strindberg's later work. All three ivere artistic means of expressing a new consciousness of human experi</page><page sequence="11">Strindberg s Dream V ision 263 ence supported by a new philosophy and science that was abandoning its classical frame of reference. Some illustrations from contemporary films by Antonioni, Bergman, Fellini and Kubrick should help to explain and support these conclusions. It may at first seem a startling claim that the ideal film must objectify extremely subjective states. Most people still think of the motion picture merely as a very good means of recording objective physical reality. Yet to those familiar with the films of Antonioni, Bergman, Fellini and Kubrick, this is no paradox. How much more centrally can Kubrick be concerned with directly presenting the inner states of his protagonists than in the last, amazing psychodelic sequence in 2001, where the character seems to be travelling literally through his own eye into his very psyche? As for Fellini, we could hardly wish that he dealt more directly with subjective states than he does in the dream sequences in 8-1/2. Take also the nightmarish, exaggerated and dis torted sequences which he presents as if from the point of view of his protagonists in La Dolce Vita, who are trying to escape the world through sexual fantasies. Bergman, too, shares this tendency toward a central concern with presenting the dream-like subjective states of his protagonists. This is literally true in the opening sequences of Wild Strawberries where the protagonist dreams that he is witnessing his own funeral and that he sees himself opening his own coffin and discovering himself lying there. In this film, as in The Magician, Bergman tries to avoid any semblance of a traditional plot structure. As in Strindberg's Miss Julie, and even more obviously in his expressionistic plays, cause and effect relationships are deliberately blurred if not obliterated. The actions are related essentially by emotional association. There is no plot, no beginning, middle and end, as there was in nineteenth century drama. Character, with its myriad motivations, its infinite probabilities, re places the traditional plot structure. If Strindberg's plays express the impact of such emerging positivistic tendencies as those exemplified in the anti-metaphysical conceptions of science and psychology ex pressed by Ernst Mach, the intervening years seem to have greatly reinforced this impact on Bergman. Positivistic science has had its heyday. Mach had shaken Einstein's faith in " mechanics as the final basis of all physical thinking," had decried " the conceptual monstrosity of absolute space " along with other metaphysical ideas in science, and had removed from psychology the " unnecessary " assumption of das Ding an sich in favor of a theory of simple correlated sensations. Each of these ideas is at work in Strindberg's plays. By the time</page><page sequence="12">264 Irving Deer Bergman and Antonioni inherit them, however indirectly, their impact is immense. The anti-metaphysical tendencies of positivistic science have all but destroyed Telos itself. For all of its rudiments of a murder mystery plot, Antonionis film, Blow-Up is an even more extreme version of this conception of human experience, and progresses even more fully through association rather than logic. This is precisely Antonioni's point, one which he tries to make again in Zabriski Point. The central tension of these films (call it " conflict" if you must) is really a conflict between two conceptions of character at war within the protagonists. On the one hand, they want to be what they really are—like Miss Julie, a composite of many unrelated motivations, an ego-less composite of many desires, (or to use Mach's terminology, a pattern of sensations or " elements"), drives, hopes, a mysterious being not easily fixed or classified. On the other hand, they desire to discover the truth to satisfy some ego centered conception of themselves participating in or at least observing some kind of plot, a beginning, middle and end to human experience. To stress the inadequacy of this ego-centered conception of char acter and experience, Antonioni relies again and again on the third tendency we have characterized (with Langer) as intrinsic to the film: he emphasizes things and actions in themselves, magnifying them, literally—as his title suggests—blowing them up, filling the whole screen with objects or even with small details from a photograph. Experiences, even objects, take on a life of their own, thus denying any interpre tation of them as subordinate elements in a traditional plot. What the film can do, according to our conception of it, is just this: it can imbue objects with a life of their own. Bergman, too, does this with startling effects similar to those gained by Strindberg through analogous techniques in his expressionistic plays. In his film, Through a Glass Darkly, Bergman has a scene in which an insane young woman stares at the wallpaper in her room, certain that it contains God. Because of the intensity with which Bergman concen trates on the wallpaper, we are suddenly able to believe the girl's vision of it. It takes on an existence of its own. Just at the moment when the concentration becomes so intense that we believe the wallpaper will reveal God, the spidery shadow of a helicopter coming to take the woman to an asylum crosses the wallpaper. Ironically, God in the form of a spider, has come to take her, not to paradise but to an asylum. The Marxist critic would see this whole sequence as an example of the alienation wrought by contemporary fetishism, an instance in which things take on a life of their own and against man.</page><page sequence="13">Strindberg s Dream Vision 265 He would point to the bitter irony of salvation coming not in the form of a cross but, rather, in the form of a straight jacket. Bergman has made so simple an object as the wallpaper reveal the girl's whole tormented subjective life. This is precisely what Strindberg is trying to do with the wallpaper, the clothes hanger and the dipnet in The Dream Play. There, as with the telegraph key in Dance of Death, he has imbued objects with a life of their own. Along with the best film makers of our day, he accomplished his desire to make reality and imagination one. To use what I hope is a telling ambiguity, he made objects in nature super-natural; he gave them an aura of creatures of the imagination, creatures with a soul and will of their own.12 Intensely subjective himself, yet dedicated to the objectivity of art, he struggled passionately to transmute the raw stuff of his inner life ino the substance of art. In his enthusiasm to discover how to achieve that transmutation, he assimilated an amazing number of avant garde ideas ranging from art through science to mysticism. The particular synthesis he achieved, his own peculiar mythology if you will, allowed him to portray an anthropomorphic conception of physical reality consistent with the strong anomic and acausal tendencies of twentieth century science. In providing an independent perspective on reality, art had asserted its equality with science. Along with our contemporary film artists, Strindberg was helping to bring men into a new inde pendent relationship, a dialogue as it were, with nature. In his work, as in theirs, science and art are joined together in a new humane concept of man. Man is no longer seen as a mere observer of a mechanical universe. He is subjective and objective at once. Like the artist, he is at last a creative participant in the search for knowledge in a mysterious, wonderful and once again unpredictably human world. la A more literal example of Strindberg's attempts to accomplish this can be seen in his use of " flowers with souls " in his play Easter.</page></plain_text>
