<plain_text><page sequence="1">Material Culture, Daily Life, and Archaeological Possibilities in the Plantation Borders of the Guanabara Bay Region1 Maria Dulce Gaspar The Guanabara Bay area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has a long occupational history that spans approximately four thousand years. Initially, the bay's contours were occupied by fishers and gath erers that built several shell mounds (sambaquis). Later, ceramic making Tupi groups from the Amazon settled villages along the rivers and islands that led to the bay. European invasion intensified the rhythm of changes with the African slave commerce and the establishment of the royal family and court (figure 1). The Sambaqui people occupied settlements along the coastal shore throughout much of the Brazilian territory, always look ing for areas near large bodies of water, like bays, lagoons, rivers, and canals (Gaspar 1991). The Tupi occupation followed the main hydrographie network like a spiderweb, where old inhabitants re mained within the empty areas (Prous 1992). This group, propelled by war and their technological superiority, invaded the territory of the Sambaqui people and interrupted sambaqui construction, lead ing to collapse of these fisher-gatherers (Gaspar 2004). Europeans were searching for commodities and safe ports for their ships, and Africans were brought to meet the demand for labor in agricultural lands, turning Rio de Janeiro into an impor tant locale for the slave trade. Africans and their deseendents flee ing slavery sought safe and strategic areas to assure survival and 1 Projeto de Caracterizaçâo, Preservaçâo e Resgate do Patrimonio Arqueológico do COMPERJ, a partnership established among the Museu Nacional/UFRJ, Associaçâo de Amigos do Museu Nacional and Petrobras S.A.

In order to investigate the daily lives of Africans and their descendents, this study focuses on the area between the Guapi-Macacu and Caceribu Rivers within the Guanabara Bay region. The Caceribu River is one of the main tributaries of the Guanabara Bay, extending al most 60 km from springs in the forested mountain range of Rio Bonito and Tangua cities, before crossing Itaborai and part of Sâo Gonçalo and flowing into the eastern part of the bay through the Guapimirim mangrove. The sub-basin of the Guapi-Macacu River is limited on the north and northeast by the Orgàos mountain range, to the northeast by the Macaé de Cima range, to the east by the Botija and Monte Azul ranges, and to the south by the Sambê and Garcia ranges. Originally, the Caceribu was a tributary of the Macacu River, but large construction projects from 1940 through the 1960s for the sanitation of the Baixada Fluminense connected it to the Gua pimirim River, creating two sub-basins where the Macacu (Guapi) and Caceribu rivers flow separately into the Guanabara Bay. The geographical configuration that was the foundation of the histori cal occupation of the area was breached. These rivers represent ed the region's social and economical structural axis since they were the main way people and goods circulated between the certâo (countryside) and the royal court in Rio de Janeiro (Negreiros et al. 2002). The colonial occupation of the Macacu and Caceribu basins began in the early sixteenth century, after the Portuguese victory in the dispute with the French for the Guanabara Bay. The region had an important role for four centuries, representing the main communication net between the certâo and the Court. The Santo Antonio de Sá Village was founded in 1567 with the donation of land close to the Tupi settlements named Aldeia Velha I, II, and III (Dias 2003). In 1697 it became a Village, the first in the surround ing plains of Guanabara Bay. The ruins of the Sâo Boaventura Convent, a focal point for Portuguese settlers, still demonstrate the importance of the locality during the colonial period. Around 1770, practically all of the territory of the Macacu re gion was already distributed by the king of Portugal. One of the main economic activities in the region was logging, practically equally important as sugarcane and manioc agriculture. According to Marques de Lavradio (1946), the district of Santo Antonio de Sá</page><page sequence="3">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 219 of Macacu was, in 1778, the biggest producer of lumber planks in Rio de Janeiro (Cabrai 2004). The region was never an area of great prominence in sugar production. Abreu's (2006) study of the evolution and spatial dis tribution of sugar mills in Rio de Janeiro capitanía in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries indicates that the Tapacurá/Caceribu area only began production in the 1640s, following the progressive movement of the capitanía population. The number of mills grew in areas further inland, occupying spaces far from the city. It is important to mention that the Tapacurá/Caceribu area is not only the last one to have sugar mills, but also it was never an important sugar producer. The region never accounted for more than 8.5% of the existing mills in Rio de Janeiro. Making use of the good quality clay and native experience in ceramic production, the Portuguese colonizers also developed pot tery factories in the region.2 In 1790, there were twelve pottery factories in the village of Santo Antonio de Sá (Lisboa 1967). In the nineteenth century, the Santo Antonio de Sá municipal ity produced sugar, sugarcane rum, flour, beans, corn, and rice, and traded sawed lumber, firewood, and charcoal. The main rivers were used to transport the goods through the Guanabara Bay to Rio de Janeiro. The importance of Santo Antonio de Sá intensified with the growth of coffee production, increasing the number of Africans used as slave labor. The situation changed with the silt ing of rivers, brought about by deforestation and heavy precipi tation that damaged the soil and created unsanitary conditions. Epidemics in 1829 and 1836 caused the extinction of settlement centers and railroad construction drew interest away from the re gion (Guzzo 1999). The occupation of this region should not be seen as isolated from the central core of the Portuguese coloniza tion of Brazil. Amantino and Cardoso (2008) demonstrate that the Macacu valley region was directly connected to the Court during the eighteenth century, since it was considered a "grain silo." Given this sociopolitical context, we can further explore the Macacu IV site, identified through archaeological research carried out between the Caceribu and Macacu Rivers. Researchers from the Casa de Pedra Laboratory of Archaeology, Museu Nacional, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFiy), have studied reg 2 The archaeological site Nascente III, located in the same research area, is an excel lent example of the first pottery factories in Caceribu and Macacu Valleys.</page><page sequence="4">220 Maria Dulce Gaspar isters and other documentary evidence, and above all, have com pleted an archaeological survey, locating 45 archaeological sites, in addition to the well-known historic site of Santo Antonio de Sá village. The sites include seven shell mounds (sambaquis), two Tupi settlements, and 36 colonial-period sites. Researchers found strong indication of the presence of Africans and their descendents at the colonial sites, within the confines of slavery, as well as runaways (see table and figure 1). Macacu IV is a site that represents a total area of 29.000 square meters, with a concentration of remains re lated to Africans and Europeans. For this reason it was chosen as the focus of our research, despite the fact that the analyses of the recovered material have not yet been completed. Table 1 Archaeological Sites Identified during the Survey and Their Cultural Affiliation Site Type Cultural Affiliation Quantity Shell sites (sambaquis) Fisher-gatherers 7 Pottery component Tupi 2 Colonial European component 34 Colonial African component 2 In an evaluation of the picture that results from the archaeo logical surveys, it is important to highlight the low incidence of sites with indubitable evidence of African occupation, even though the literature emphasizes the presence of several maroon commu nities (quilombos) in the region. According to Gomes (2006: 35), the Guanabara Bay area flourished with quilombolas (escaped slaves or maroons) that found shelter in the mangroves and along creeks of the plains. Africans formed quilombos, and the most important ones were located along the margins of the Sarapui and Iguaçù Rivers, close to the Nossa Senhora do Pilar and Santo Antonio de Jacutinga parishes. Particular attention must be paid to the Su ruhí quilombo, located near the Magé, Santo Antonio de Sá, and Inhomerim villages.</page><page sequence="5">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 221 Figure 1 Map of Research Area with the Locations of Archaeological Sites</page><page sequence="6">222 Maria Dulce Gaspar Taking historical sources into consideration, the scarcity of ar chaeological sites occupied by runaway Africans is surprising, but can be explained by the influence of several factors. This social segment was entrenched within the developing Brazilian society and their associated domestic articles are not necessarily differ ent from the items owned by other Brazilians of low means. On the other hand, some of their settlements were by their nature discreet, either to avoid detection by the Brazilian authorities or because they did not have sufficient material resources, such as roof tiles, bricks, and metal hardware, to construct their settle ments. Santo Antonio de Sá village had a strong presence in the region and controlled farmable lands. Despite the existence of qui lombos like Suruhi, we can visualize residences as small wooden houses made of materials from their surroundings. Their frailness did not leave noticeable evidence for archaeological investigation. This invisibility contrasts with the ruins of the buildings associated with Europeans, constructed with mortar and foundations that are easily detectable during surveys. The invisibility of the African oc cupation reinforces the importance of Macacu IV and demands its detailed investigation. THE MACACU IV ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE The Macacu IV archaeological site, located in Itaborai, is estab lished in an area characterized by the presence of low-lying hills, on top of a small elevation 20 meters high, approximately 2 km from the Caceribu River, and 100 m distant from a small creek. The hill has three flat areas and a slope that descends to the north. Two hundred ninety-seven shovel tests, following east-west transects, were excavated to identify archaeological deposits, allowing the team to establish the site limits that encompass an area of 29,000 square meters and to define the excavation areas. Seven areas were excavated, totaling 468 square meters. Excavation was completed following stratigraphie layers, using 15 cm levels as vertical control. Surrounding the excavation areas, backhoes were used to excavate 29 test trenches measuring 85 cm wide and varying between 8 and 52 meters in length. These trenches were excavated in order to more accurately delimit concentrations of archaeological materials and investigate the presence of external structures, such as ditches</page><page sequence="7">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 223 or drains (see figure 2).3 The association of shovel tests, excavation areas, and test trenches allowed analysis of spatial patterning of the site. The observations presented in this article are supported by the analyses of three areas with distinctive characteristics: the African dwelling space (E1/E2), the combustion area (E5), also associated with Africans, and the ruins of a building constructed following European norms (E3) (see figure 3).

Characterized by numerous African and European artifacts, it presented evidence of an ephemeral structure through negative impressions of the posts used to support a roof. It includes nine postholes measuring approximately 8 cm in diameter, and 22 larger postholes about 30 cm in diameter. The large postholes were filled with charcoal and roof tile fragments arranged in a wedge 3 The description of the methodology used in the studies done at the Guanabara Bay is currently being prepared for publication.</page><page sequence="8">224 Maria Dulce Gaspar position, probably to help stabilize the structure. The spatial dis tribution of the postholes suggests a circular space, probably built with wattle and daub. In the interior of the space, a corrugated bowl with beehive motifs on its handles was recovered. The team found charcoal, ce ramic fragments and the neck of an olive jar within the vessel. The arrangement suggests that it was carefully placed, and its proxim ity to the postholes implies the possible presence of a small shelf (Jirau). All seem to be indicative of a ritual offering.

It is characterized by greasy/oily sediment and a large thermally altered feature full of bone fragments, shell valves, fragments of ce ramic vessels (thin, thick, with or without decoration), fragmented pipes (with and without decoration), tin-glazed ceramic fragments (white and decorated, predominantly blue), manganese concretions, quartz blocks, roof tile and brick fragments, along with charcoal.</page><page sequence="9">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 225 A small stove was also identified in this excavation area. It is composed of two holes surrounded by clay. The team recovered ceramic rim sherds, charcoal, and faunal remains in the midst of the greasy sediment within the feature. Large and small postholes were identified in association with the feature. The presence of iron slag indicates that the area was used for metal work. In one sector of the excavation area, archaeologists systematically collect ed samples for macrobotanical4 and zooarchaeological5 analyses, which have already produced preliminary results. In the area with more evidence of European occupation (E3), most of the house foundation was identified, including ten rooms distributed in an area measuring 30 by 30 meters. The house was a substantial structure, and the mortar used to join the bricks in cluded clay, lime, shells, and quartz fragments. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATION AND THE PIPES Shovel tests and test trenches revealed distinctively colored sed iment in the northwestern part of the site. It suggests an intensive and/or distinct occupation in relation to other investigated sites. The large quantity of pipes that was recovered during excavations added to the distinctiveness of the area. The presence of pipes alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of a slave settlement, since smoking was a common activity in the colonial society that was being formed in the tropics. How ever, according to Agostini (2009), pipes are privileged for the study of conscious decoration choices among daily and ritual objects in comparison with other artifact classes. The presence of decorative motifs that can be associated with African patterns, either in pipes or other ceramic artifacts, such as a small clay reproduction of a face with scarification, indicate that the space is different from the others investigated by the team. In a comparative analysis with other sites studied in the area, the presence of a high number of whole and 4 Macrobotanical analysis consists of the identification of charcoal. Samples from this project are being analyzed by Gina Bianchini, under the supervision of Dr. Rita Schell-Ybert, Museu Nacional. 5 Zooarchaeological analysis consists of the identification and interpretation of faunal remains. Dr. Daniela Klôkler, a postdoctoral fellow at Museu National/UFRJ, developed the faunal analysis (Klôkler 2010).</page><page sequence="10">226 Maria Dulce Gaspar Figure 4 Quantity of Pipes by Archaeological Site.

Comparison of both charts (see figures 4 and 5) indicates that Macacu IV's European space (E3) exhibits pipe quantities compa rable to the other settlements Europeans already investigated in the area between the Macacu and Caceribu Rivers. This reinforces the hypothesis that the northwest area of the site (including E1/E2 and E5) was primarily occupied by Africans. Figure 4 shows that Macacu II is also an exception, since it presents quantities of pipes similar to the African quarters of Macacu IV, and for this reason, it will be included in our study. Preliminary analysis done by Agostini (performed during the fieldwork season) highlights that the assemblage of pipes from Macacu IV exhibits highly variable shapes and decoration mo tifs (2008), but they are compatible with other collections studied by the same author (Agostini 1997). Some patterns identified at Macacu IV site are similar or even identical to patterns recovered from nineteenth-century contexts in other sites, but some pieces that exhibit baroque characteristics indicate an earlier period of manufacture. Agostini proposes that the pipes were produced using model ing or press mold techniques, and the diversity of clays utilized in their manufacture suggests diversity in the production sources of these objects (2008).6 The high indices of decorative diversity, clays, and production techniques point to the varied provenances of the pipes. The high number of pieces in one place does not necessar ily indicate that Macacu IV was a pipe production center. On the contrary, the data suggest that the site attracted people from dif ferent regions, becoming a meeting point and a locale of intense sociability. The study of the pipes estimated a minimum of 67 individual pipes present at the site. A motif resembling gastropod shells is present in four pipes and a composition of triangular shapes oc curs in another twelve. These triangles are also present in some ceramic fragments. Among the pipes and pipe fragments found, 24% exhibit motifs inspired by African patterns (figure 6). 6 Analyses confirmed that the pipes were manufactured with clays from different provenances (Coelho 2012; Calza et al., forthcoming).</page><page sequence="12">228 Maria Dulce Gaspar The high number of pipes with elaborate decoration and the repetition of motifs found in ceramics compelled us to perform a detailed investigation of these artifacts. The plant material used in the pipes recovered from Macacu II, III, IV and Morro do Sol sites is being studied, so more African customs may be identified.7 The analysis of microscopic remains seeks to investigate the smoking practices in Brazil during the colonial period, search ing for evidence of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum and N. rustica) and cannabis (Cannabis sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis) in the pipes found in the sites. The analysis did not identify diagnostic phyto liths of these species in the material recovered from the pipes, nor was it possible to find matches in the reference collection. On the other hand, the presence of calcium oxalates (calcium oxalate phy toliths) in crystal/rosette aggregates form was identified in some of the samples. Studies have demonstrated that calcium oxalates, especially in crystal/rosette aggregate forms, can be found in can nabis trichomes. Its presence in the pipe and C. sativa and C. rude ralis samples from the reference collection suggest that it can be a valuable way to identify cannabis, but more studies are needed to obtain more consistent data. Agostini's (2008) assertion that the average size of Macacu IV pipe bowls is small reinforces the preliminary hypothesis that plants other than tobacco were used. In light of the data, the re searcher suggests that the burned plants could be stronger, which could account for the small dimensions of some pieces. The laboratory analyses of the objects recovered from the African space were surprising, due to the volume of material, but also due to the diversity of shapes and decoration of the artifacts. Ceramic vessels with motifs different from the ones found on pots clearly related to native or European societies stood out during the analysis. Above all, the aforementioned pipes, one with the reproduction of a scarified face, and ceramic handles with varied shapes reflect goods associated with African or African-descendent groups. In addition, the marks left by wood posts or poles delin eate a space organized in a different way than European patterns. The household artifacts in general confirm an African origin for the occupation. 7 Phytolith analysis is being performed by Regina Norma Santana, under the super vision of Dr. Rita Scheel-Ybert, Museu Nacional/UFRJ.</page><page sequence="13">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 229 Figure 6 a) Pipe; b) Ceramic Fragment; and c) Representation of Face with Scarifications a) ..vdjs b) c) Source: Photos by Beto Barcellos.</page><page sequence="14">230 Maria Dulce Gaspar SLAVE QUARTER OR MAROON SETTLEMENT (QUILOMBO)? The dataset indicates that the area had an African occupation and its proximity to the ruins of a building with European ele ments begs the question of whether these Africans were slaves un der the rule of landowners, or runaways. In the first hypothesis, the area with concentrated African elements would be the slave quarters and the two areas would have been occupied contempo raneously. A second hypothesis is that both occupations (African and European) happened consecutively. In this case, the area El/ E2 included a shack occupied by maroons, and European settlers later inhabited the same locality. Taking into account the ruins' characteristics—size, dimension, and building material—we can in fer that if the occupation of both spaces was not contemporaneous, the European house was built later and was active for a long period of time. The spatial study of Macacu IV suggests that is not likely that the African area was slave quarters, since it is located relatively distant from the landowner's house. The literature informs us that there is great variability in the distances between slave quarters and the main house. Slave quarters were built contiguous to the house, for effective slave control, as is the case of the Aurora farm in the town of Araruama; or they could be placed at a distance of more than 70 meters, as these spaces are at Macacu IV (figure 3). Despite the existence of examples in which the landowner's house is distant from the slave quarters, it is not probable that slaves were controlled without close physical proximity, since the Macacu val ley was a region based on an extractive economy and survival af ter an escape could be easily accomplished by Africans. It is also known that slaveholders chose to use men who had family ties to conduct wood exploitation operations, an activity that offered fa vorable conditions for escapes (Cabrai 2007). We must highlight the fact that metal artifacts from the site are primarily building tools and objects used on a daily basis. In the area where the brick building is located (E3), the materials are mainly objects that were part of the building, such as lock parts and hinges (door and window), as well as personal property, like eye glasses. In the African space, materials are distributed as follows: in area El a horseshoe nail, another nail, and a colander or grat er were recovered; from E2 a horseshoe nail, nail, and cartridge;</page><page sequence="15">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 231 and at E5 iron slag, a horseshoe nail, another nail, and a colander were found. Surprisingly, artifacts that could be associated with slave control were not found in any areas of the site. Handcuffs and chains are not present at Macacu IV. Researchers recovered only objects used in daily life and related to the household, which included metalworking activities. The presence of a cartridge fits well with the lives of possible runaway slaves who needed to safe guard their protection and hunt for food. The iron slag, associated with the greasy sediment, suggests that the space was an area for processing raw materials. The recovery of metal objects and fragments leads us to men tion the conditions that allow their preservation in the soil. The dimensions of the investigated area aided the recovery of a signifi cant sample of metal objects. This reinforces the significance of the lack of items for restraint or punishment. The absence of artifacts associated with slave control, along with the relative distance be tween the African space and the European homestead makes the physical control of slaves less viable, and therefore also the simulta neous occupation of both the main house and the slave quarters. ARCHAEOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES AND TIME It is always a challenge to build chronologies for settlements oc cupied after the European invasion. The timing of artifact manu facture offers a limit for the occupation period as it relates to the range of time in which items were being used and discarded. How ever, many objects have long use-lives and can be used throughout many generations. Radiocarbon dates have error margins that en compass decades, during which significant changes can occur in the social arrangements involving the various segments of a society that was being formed, and that at the same time was integrated with large European centers. Despite these exceptions, we try to compose a framework for our research. Mandarino and Vences (2009) synthesize the studies already done on the site. In the building area (E3), approximately 1,740 ceramic fragments were recovered, and the majority (n=1160) ex hibit simple decoration, followed by examples of glazed (300) and brushed/scraped decoration (140). Simple and refined tin-glazed ware fragments are also represented. In relation to quantity, the</page><page sequence="16">232 Maria Dulce Gaspar tin-glaze ware subclass surpasses the refined tin-glazed ware. Some decorative patterns are common. "Yayal Blue-on-White" is pre dominant, followed in decreasing order by concentric semicircles and "Ichtucknee," with production dates ranging from the end of the sixteenth until the beginning of the seventeenth century, ac cording to the Florida Museum of Natural History (website). In the same temporal context, however in lower numbers, we can in clude "Aranhâo"—with manufacture dating to the second half of the sixteenth century. The remaining patterns, such as Lace, Dots, "Volutas," Heraldry, and Monogram, date between the second half and the end of the seventeenth century. In the case of the pattern named "Pseudoepigráfica" or "Louça do Brioso," the production period has been defined by some authors as corresponding to the beginning of the eighteenth century (Barreira et al, 1995: 159 61). The zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remains recovered from the area identified remains associated with domestic animals, such as cattle, as the dominant component of the samples; the only specimen representing wild animals was a single catfish bone. An important characteristic of the African space (E1/E2) is the presence of particular ceramic elements not found in the rest of the Macacu IV site. Among these elements are: a bowl with beehive decoration on its handles; an anthropomorphic figure; ceramic fragments with triangular motifs and a fragment with a decora tive motif called "horizon"; the neck of a type A olive jar from the seventeenth century, found inside the bowl; and the bottom of a sugar loaf mold. The team also recovered: glass beads; heraldic tin-glazed ware; an 80 réis imperial copper coin; and a round ob ject similar to a metal coin with peculiar symbols that have not yet been identified. The symbols are similar to a crossed key inside a coat of arms, with a star on top. It could be a seal used on official documents. The tin-glazed ware predominant in the area has concentric semicircle decoration, followed by "Yayal." Refined tin-glazed ware was not recovered. The E1/E2 locality at Macacu IV is marked by the presence of a tin-glazed piece with the heraldic sym bol of the Silva family, similar to the plates recovered from the Sacramento shipwreck at Todos os Santos Bay (Brancante 1981: 271), and another plate fragment with the symbol of the Domini can order, demonstrating the presence in the region during the</page><page sequence="17">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 233 seventeenth century not only of nobility, but also of a religious or der besides the Jesuits and Franciscans. Area E5 is characterized by a thick black layer, holes with greasy sediment, and a great quantity of iron and manganese concretion, among other materials. Laboratory analyses also indicated the presence of high numbers of ceramics, approximately 2180 frag ments. Like the building area, the great majority is composed of simple ceramics, followed by vitrified and brushed varieties. The iron concretion calls attention to area E5 because of its volume and singularity. It was probably created during the smelting process. Like E3, E5 has higher frequencies of "Yayal" (Yayal Blue-on White) tin-glazed wares, totaling 93 specimens. On the other hand, tin-glazed materials from later periods were not found. A 10 réis copper coin with the representation of the armillary sphere with out a blazon/coat of arms used in Portuguese colonial coins was recovered, along with glass and stoneware fragments. The earthen ware fragment corresponds to the body of ajar decorated in cobalt blue, probably produced between 1575 and 1759 in the Frechen Raeren region, in the Rhine Valley, Germany.8 The analysis of the earthenware, especially the Portuguese ma jolica and an olive jar neck produced during the seventeenth cen tury and recovered from within the bowl with African decoration, suggests the possibility that the first European occupation of the site occurred between the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries. It could have been the first effective incursion of non-native groups in the region. This hypothesis does not dismiss the African presence, it only reinforces the co-occu pation of European and African elements at a moment when the building (E3) did not exist. On the other hand, the brick structure could have been built at the end of the eighteenth century and oc cupied throughout the next century. The volume and the variety of archaeological materials recov ered are remarkable, as well as the chronological range of the items. Areas E1/E2 and E5 contain a preponderance of objects produced between the end of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, while there is high incidence of materials from the end of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries at area E3. However, it is important to 8 Information collected at: http://www.Jlmnh.ufl.edu/histarch/gallery_types/type_index_ display. asp?type_name=stoneware,%20Rhenish%20blue%20and%20gray.</page><page sequence="18">234 Maria Dulce Gaspar highlight that the majority does not mean totality, since materials from both chronological ranges were found at all areas. As a result of the difficulty in understanding the possible con temporaneity between the African and European spaces solely through the study of the artifact assemblages, the team sent sev eral samples for radiocarbon dating. Three dates from different excavation areas are already available. Even taking into account that the error margin in radiocarbon dates can encompass succes sive occupations—the shack and the homestead—the team believes the results can provide important temporal parameters. Due to the belief that the beehive-decorated bowl could be associated with African rituals and because it was intentionally deposited by the shack's inhabitants, I gave preference to samples recovered from its interior (M4e2S2) and in charcoal fragments found in the proxim ity, at 35 cm deep (M4E2S2N4). The results presented an inconsistency, since the charcoal sample collected inside the bowl provided a very early date, be fore the European invasion, and was not considered. On the other hand, the sample recovered from the area surrounding the bowl (M44E2SN4) provided a date between 1440 and 1630 a.d. This date presents a large range of probability, an inherent characteristic of radiocarbon methods. However, if we take into account the rela tive dating of archaeological materials identified in the area, it is possible to affirm that the period of occupation is closer to the 1700s. Comparison of the date from the African space with the date from area E3 (M43T4Q4), which provided an interval from 1650 to 1960, shows clearly that both spaces were not occupied simultane ously. The house, of European style, was occupied later than the wattle and daub construction, around the 1800s, as indicated by the analyses of refined tin-glazed ware and stoneware recovered from this space. The preliminary results offer more possibilities than certain ties, reflective of the dynamism of historical sets that allow a va riety of social situations. Conversely, it underscores the existence of a stronger hypothesis among the ones presented in this study. Distributions of earthenware, majolica, refined tin-glazed ware, stoneware, metals, and associated radiocarbon dates demonstrate a temporal precedence of the African space in relation to the area built by the Europeans. The preponderance of refined tin-glaze</page><page sequence="19">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 235 wares, distinctive of the nineteenth century, glass fragments, and even a pair of glasses (invented in 1784), places this component comfortably within the nineteenth century. The same cannot be said for the African area, which suggests an earlier occupation. Figure 7 Available Dates from the Macacu IV Site M4E2S2 6I7436BP A A. M4E2S2N4 426±37BP ■k L—ZZT1 —.——f—.

They were able to break away from slaveholders' control and inserted themselves into the Macacu Valley economy, exploiting the Atlantic forest resources. Area E5 contains the great majority of faunal remains recov ered from the site. Zooarchaeological analysis identified animal bones from wild species like cavidae, paca, peccary, and two spe cies of armadillo. Fish and cattle remains were also recovered. Macrobotanical analysis from charcoal recovered in E5 found that evidence of edible plant remains, such as seeds and fruits, is in significant. The low frequency of bark remains should also be em phasized. The unimportance of these items at Macacu IV indicates that most of the wood was probably derived from processed logs. As mentioned before, the exploitation and commercialization of wood in the Macacu River region was intense, and the leftovers of the activities probably served as an excellent fuel source for the lo cal communities.</page><page sequence="20">236 Maria Dulce Gaspar Wood removal and processing for the market allowed the in habitants to participate in the local economy, and this is represent ed in the material culture not only by the presence of processed wood, but, above all, by the presence of European artifacts. On one hand, a diet largely based on wild animals alludes to a life way relatively independent of European-dominated centers. The integration is not intense, since dietary needs were fulfilled more by the exploitation of nature than the acquisition of items sold in markets or trading posts. The lower frequency of domestic animal elements could also be linked to the difficulty in accessing them or to food preferences. It is worth mentioning that the E5 material commonly presents evidence of burning, indicating a type of proc essing that differs from methods used in other areas of the site. Pipes, due to their decorative, paste, and production variabil ity, suggest that the area was a meeting point for Africans coming from different locations. The indication of African ritual practices reinforces the idea that Macacu IV was an important location in the slavery escape strategy and an area where one could (re)en counter a traditional lifestyle, as lived on the African continent. It is in this context that evidence of metallurgical activities, a tra ditional practice full of meaning for Africans, can be understood. Macacu IV seems to have been an important locale in the African escape and survival network in Guanabara Bay. MACACU II Macacu II is another archaeological site that presented a large concentration of pipes, so it provides an interesting comparative dimension (figure 4). It is located on the left margin of Macacu river, and also presents a structure facing northwest, in front of the river. The building, covering an area measuring 13 by 7 meters, has five small rooms of varied dimensions. One room contains the base of a round brick structure, measuring 1.4 m in diameter. In close proximity to one of the building's walls there was another cir cular construction with the same dimensions, with residual brick marks and evidence of burning and charcoal. In addition to this building, the site includes the remains of a mud/adobe building with a hearth. In another area, materials were found spread across the surface and also buried, without indication of other structures.</page><page sequence="21">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 237 Similar to Macacu IV, there is an indication that one component preceded the other in time, since the refined tin-glazed wares from the brick building have later production dates. The earthenware recovered include pot, pan, lid, and jar frag ments, and some exhibit evidence of burning. Among the many types of decoration, a few pieces have lines and stamping that are reminiscent of African decorative motifs. The Macacu II site is notable for the abundance of refined tin glazed wares, and, on a minor scale, the presence of stoneware. Both subclasses are related to the period between the second half of the eighteenth and the end of the nineteenth centuries. Among the refined tin-glazed ware, there are British wares with and with out decoration. The pieces without painted decoration are plate fragments with molded rims, in the Royal Rim pattern with yel lowish enamel, an attribute of creamware. The beginning of pro duction of this type of ware in England is identified between 1720 and 1740 (Godden 1980: xv). This type of refined earthenware, in the case of Macacu II, primarily consists of small cups, bowls, and chamber pots. "Shell-Edge Blue" and "Shell-Edge Green" decorat ed elements were also recovered. According to Hunter and Miller (1994), this was cheap and readily available tableware that circu lated through British commerce between 1780 and 1860. Fragments with transfer printing were also identified. They were produced in England during the first decades of the nine teenth century, with several motifs extending into the twentieth century. Regarding serveware pieces, the volume—as noted during preliminary analysis—is not significant, and most elements were identified as plate fragments. Conversely, there are greater num bers of isolated pieces such as small cups, bowls, and mugs. These elements contain either of two decorative techniques: hand-painted polychrome and dipped. In the first case, the motifs include large and small stylized flowers, corresponding to decorative elements used from 1810 (Majewski and O'Brien 1987) and known as "Peas ant" (Tocchetto et al 2001), Free Style (Godden 1980), or "Early Hand-Painted Polychrome" (Florida Museum of Natural History website). English vessels with applied slips and dipped earthenware with production dates ranging from the beginning of the eigh teenth until the end of the nineteenth century were identified at Macacu II. Their design motifs were "Annular Banded" (band, bar, stripe) and "Annular Engine Turning" (c. 1770 until the end of the</page><page sequence="22">238 Maria Dulce Gaspar nineteenth century). Besides these types, one piece was identified with characteristics of blue mottled decoration ("Borrâo Azul"), a style produced during the nineteenth century that enjoyed great popularity during the Victorian period (1837-1901). Stoneware containers are temporarily linked to the period be tween the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The pieces are be lieved to belong to cylindrical bottles, suitable as containers for transport and storage of water and distilled drinks, such as Genever (Hollands gin). Noël Hume (2001: 80) associates brown cylindri cal stoneware bottles with production dates ranging between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The bottles from Macacu II include specimens from the Netherlands and Germany, mainly from the Wynand Amsterdam, Wynand Focking, and Setters Herzog thum Nassau brands. The first two are related to beverage distilla tion and commercialization, active since 1679 in Amsterdam. The last brand represents mineral water from Germany from a source in the Niederselters region. In Brazil, stoneware bottles similar to the ones recovered in Macacu II were reused for beverage storage, especially distilled sugarcane (aguárdente). Regarding metal, pieces related to storage and labor (tools, chains, hooks, bell, and barrel belt), riding and clothing (stirrup, buckle, horseshoe), building (nail, horseshoe nail, bolt, plaque, and key), household use (an oil lamp piece, scissors, silverware), and personal use (button, earrings, brooch) were found. One of the coins is from the eighteenth century, while the rest date to the end of the nineteenth century. Four metal pieces are still under analysis and may have been used to punish slaves. The strategic location of Macacu II, at the margins of the Macacu River, and its materials suggest that the site was an area where products and people were circulating. It is probable that it was an important point in the clandestine commerce, protection, and solidarity net of quilombolas (maroons), as suggested by Gomes in his study of maroon communities in Rio de Janeiro (1996: 11). Located on the Macacu River, whether it was a tavern, shop, or resting place, it was probably a meeting point where drink, food, and other goods created and maintained a network that involved sellers, farmers, workers, local authorities, runaways, and slaves. It could have been a trading post where food and beverages were sold, as the great quantities of bowls, small cups, plates, and stone ware and glass bottles suggest.</page><page sequence="23">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 239 The analysis of the beverage containers and the chronologies obtained from the identification of some types of refined tin-glazed wares supports the notion that Macacu II was occupied from the be ginning of the eighteenth until the end of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, the tin-glazed ware with patterns associated with the sixteenth and seventeenth, and in some cases up to the eighteenth century,9 suggest an earlier occupation. This showed the charac teristics of a richer household, due to the presence of heraldry patterns, such as a knight helmet with jar beak and part of the bla zonry of the Silva family in the bottom of a plate (Brancante 1981: 271). The hypothesis is reinforced by the identification of púcaro (a small bowl with handles) or Terra Sigilata from Estremoz fragments (thin-walled pottery).10 This type of earthenware, made in the Por tuguese region that borders the Estremadura in Spain, has lately been considered as refined, with production defined between the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centu ries (Dordio 2004; Gomes and Gomes 1995). The vitrified green or yellow ceramic fragments from big bellied water pitchers, basins, and/or globe-shaped little jars, are similar to Iberian products dur ing the seventeenth century. Later, between the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, this strategic area was part of the route of goods that circulated through the Macacu River, which was at the time the fastest and safest way to distribute and also receive goods. The evidence suggests small-scale production, storage, and com mercialization of manioc flour and/or sugarcane rum. Tool blades were used to cultivate the soil, and round structures were probably used to process root plants, hypotheses confirmed by macrobotani cal analysis. Zooarcheological study revealed the important evidence of cattle elements, as well as pig and horse remains, among other species. The presence of skull fragments associated with bone with cutmarks, indicates that animals may have been raised in the sur rounding area or brought to Macacu II to be butchered and proc essed. Fish bones and mollusk valves suggest the exploitation of the nearby river and Guanabara Bay. Containers, stoneware bowls, glass, and vitrified bottles were used for storage of goods that could 9 As attested by a Spanish Blue green basin piece with production dates between 1750 and 1820 (according to the Florida Museum of Natural History website). 10 http://portal. iphan.gov. br/catálogo_iphan/index, htm.</page><page sequence="24">240 Maria Dulce Gaspar be stocked in one of the small rooms. The smaller bowls and cups were used for serving containers. Notwithstanding the large quantity of pipes, where are the Africans in this context? Unlike Macacu IV, the first component of Macacu II is not related to runaway slaves, but to European colonizers. There is no indication that the Africans inhabited the area and organized the space according to their customs. In con trast, the recovered chains, possibly used to restrain slaves, suggest the presence of people in a condition of domination. Its presence can be related to the inner workings of a canteen, where Africans could, at the same time, provide service and/or exchange goods, to insert themselves into a network that involved colonizers, slaves, runaways, and others. Pipes could be among the traded goods and we cannot dis count the idea that it could be the reason for their high incidence at the site. However, it does not seem likely that this is the explana tion for their numbers. As suggested for Macacu IV, Macacu II can be understood as a meeting point, but in this case it was controlled by Europeans and associated with the acquisition and commercial ization of goods. Bottles, cups, and bowls are related to the con sumption of food and alcoholic beverages, habits that are usually combined with smoking. The strategic position of the site suggests a locale to load and land goods assembled by Europeans and slaves of different status, where products extracted from the area or obtained through theft were exchanged. Since it was a space characterized by merchandise trading, it could be intensely visited by slaves or runaways, a pos sibility indicated by the large numbers of pipes. CONCLUSION Although the analyses are still underway, there are strong in dications that the E1/E2 portion of Macacu IV was occupied by a group of Africans and/or their descendants who escaped from the control of slaveholders. Members of the group pursued an oc cupation that would fit into the "independent quilombo" category adopted by Amantino (2003: 251), which according to his defini tion, refers to groups devoted to the simple exploitation of natural resources, without previous investment of human energy. Its mem</page><page sequence="25">PLANTATION BORDERS OF THE GUANABARA BAY REGION 241 bers obtained sustenance through hunting, fishing, gathering, and plundering/looting, and they changed bands frequently. Maybe the best way to characterize Macacu IV is by the image of a shack where Africans who escaped from slavery could hide. We can envision a small group that survived through the ex ploitation of natural resources, as suggested by the analysis of food remains, which suggests wild animals were an important part of the diet. The artifacts with European origins and the wood exploi tation, indicated by the analysis of charcoal remains, indicate a cer tain level of integration with the local community. It is known that wood was one of the most important products of the Macacu River valley. On the other hand, the diversity among pipes indicates that the site was an important meeting point for Africans, and their social interaction was certainly marked by African rituals, which the beehive-decorated bowl seems to evidence. The presence of a dark-colored layer suggests an intensive occupation with large deposition of organic materials, characteristics that coincide with African ritual practices. Evidence of metalworking activities, part of the traditional knowledge of several African nations, could indicate a point of at traction for runaway slaves, who would find the means necessary to reproduce their routine activities at the site. If we are facing a context of challenging the order of slavery, metal working would have incredible importance. It seems that the Africans that occupied Macacu IV were run aways from slaveholders, had independent means to obtain food resources, and were integrated with other social groups through the exchange of goods. At present, we believe that it is possible to consider Macacu IV as a meeting place and a location for the acqui sition and repair of metal objects, as well as a space full of religious and symbolic meaning.
