<plain_text><page sequence="1">MELISSA IANETTA JAMES FREDAL University of Delaware The Ohio State University Surveying the Stories We Tell: English, Communication, and the Rhetoric of Our Surveys of Rhetoric In rhetorical studies recent attention to the central role of pedagogy in the for mation of disciplinary identity has obscured the disciplinary-based differences in the presentation of the history of rhetoric in English and communication class rooms. This essay surveys introductory rhetoric textbooks to contrast our presen tations of rhetorical history. For a long time, Speech, [. . . a] half-brother, had lived with English; but after his association with Elocution, English just couldn yt accept him, so he soon moved out. Speech later broke up with Elocution but in the sixties had a happy relationship with Rhetoric [...]. Around 1970, Composition struck up its acquaintance with Rhetoric, who was not getting along very well with Speech. [. . . T]he result was that Speech lost interest in Rhetoric, and Rhetoric took up with Composition on the rebound. [. ..] Composition and Rhetoric were married, and instead of a hyphenated last name, they used a slash and became Rhetoric/Com position. ?Winifred Bryan Horner {"Kneupper Memorial Address: An Allegory" 198-99) Once upon a time, but not very long ago, there was a poor waif named Rhetoric. Though once the ruler of the arts, he had been banished from Europe and had found an academic home only in a new and unstable fief dorn known as the American Department of Speech. The people who lived in this fief dorn were concerned to define its boundaries so that it would not be annexed by powerful neighbors. Most of all, they feared the Duchy of English, which might try to enslave Rhetoric and com mandeer his sections of the public speaking course. [...] As it turned Rhetoric Review, Vol. 25, No. 2, 185-203 Copyright ? 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. 185</page><page sequence="2">186 Rhetoric Review out, the lords of English were concerned with their own squabbles and had no time to invade other territories. So the fiefdom of Speech survived. ?Michael Leff ("The Habitation of Rhetoric" 55) Regardless of their disciplinary homes, contemporary scholars have an en during interest in revising the history of rhetoric, although there can be consider able variations in the stories they tell.1 These differences often engage questions of disciplinarity, territoriality, and power, even as they betray fundamental simi larities that point to rhetoric's precarious status within higher education. For whether we personify Rhetoric as the jilted lover of Communication (n?e Speech), now in a second marriage with Composition studies (both currently living in the household of English), or as a poor waif whom Communication rescued from threatened enslavement by the Duchy of English, both sides of this custody dispute cast Rhetoric as without a home of its own?as Leff says, "ban ished"?and in need of a protector?as Horner describes, "on the rebound." Like these fictionalized accounts of an anthropomorphic Rhetoric, the family histories created in our textbooks are often shaped by the tensions in herent to rhetoric's disciplinary status. Unlike the epigraph to this essay, how ever, textbook presentations often overlook the current situation, preferring to dwell instead upon a glorious and regal past, when rhetoric ruled its demesne independently and was itself paid tribute by many smaller fiefdoms. Alterna tively, when dealing with rhetoric's current living arrangements, textbooks tend to set disciplinarity to the side, allowing us to meditate upon current narratives of "Big Rhetoric" and its expansive interdisciplinary and metatheoretical so phistication.2 That is, given the universal importance of academia's "rhetorical turn," we seem to say, "What does it matter where rhetoric is housed?" Such historically and theoretically informed moves allow introductory courses to avoid the "indelicacies" of institutional dependence and interdisciplinarity, and all those paradoxes, disagreements, and contradictions that help shape contem porary rhetorical study. Put another way, we tend to avoid unseemliness when telling familial stories for the children; or in the case of rhetoric, the students. And yet the histories we offer our students, like the stories told to children, are not only the most powerful in terms of identity formation but also the most revealing about how we conceive of ourselves and our place in the world. Just as Leff's and Homer's tales reveal disciplinary biases within a common narrative pattern, a comparison of the histories of rhetoric told in classrooms re veals both interdisciplinary common ground and departmental differences. By</page><page sequence="3">Surveying the Stories We Tell 187 examining the textbooks used in undergraduate and introductory graduate rhetoric courses, we can better understand the current rhetoric of our histories of rhetoric. Such an investigation discloses important, departmentally oriented differences in our framing of rhetorical history and theory as well as a surprising neglect of rhetoric's current disciplinary affiliations. Exploring these histories, we believe, improves our understanding of rhetoric as it is taught in departments of English and Communication and so contributes to the growing dialogue surrounding rhetoric's disciplinary status. Such an examination seems particularly timely. With the founding of the Alliance of Rhetorical Societies (ARS), rhetoricians from a range of disciplines are paying increased attention to the possibilities created by the dispersal of rhetoric across the university: The Alliance of Rhetoric Societies exists to advance research and teaching in the art of rhetoric. Toward that end it seeks to foster col laboration among the different scholarly organizations and commu nities whose members' work includes, in whole or in part, the tradi tions and techniques of rhetorical studies [...]. ARS seeks to bridge these institutional borders in order to make scholars known to one another, to facilitate dialogue, to promote intellectual community, and to provide advocacy in support of the continuing development of the art. ("About ARS" par. 1) As an organization, then, ARS seeks to define areas of mutual interest to scholars from a variety of departments to enrich our understanding of rhetoric's interdisciplinarity. Speaking of the 2003 ARS conference, Michael Leff suggests that scholars from across the university find the common ground of a "disciplin ary rhetoric" in their rhetorical traditions and teaching experiences: As far as I could judge, the people at the conference tended towards disciplinary rhetoric, and there seemed two common features that marked this tendency. The first is a knowledge of and interest in a canonical group of texts. [...] The second mark of disciplinary rhet oric has to do with its grounding in teaching. I mean here specifi cally the teaching of composition, public speaking, argumentation, and persuasion. People who teach such subjects regularly and seriously have common interests that surface whenever they talk together, and this classroom experience is as close to a bedrock for disciplinary rhetoric as anything that I have encountered. (Lunsford and Leff, "Theoretical and Practical" par. 5)</page><page sequence="4">188 Rhetoric Review In this same interview, Andrea Lunsford concurs with Leff's assertion regarding rhetoric's pedagogical focus, noting its "long and rich tradition of taking this teaching very seriously" (Lunsford and Leff, "History" par. 4). Leff and Lunsford rightly cite the foundational role of pedagogy in the rhetorical tradi tion, and the recent formation of the ARS reflects a growing concern with the disciplinary status of rhetoric. While such professional developments enrich our historical understanding, when we examine how rhetoric's "rich tradition" is constructed in the classroom, we discover disciplinary differences between the stories we tell our students and the histories we share with our peers. Such an in vestigation also reveals in our introductory courses a surprising lack of attention to those contemporary issues of pedagogy and disciplinarity that currently concern scholars of rhetoric. Although individuals have addressed the shape of rhetoric courses taught in communication studies (see Rhetorical Studies) and in English studies (see Enos, "Survey"), somewhat less attention has been paid to the pedagogical effects of rhetoric's interdisciplinarity on the education of our next generation of scholars.3 By focusing on Introduction to Rhetorical Theory courses offered at the advanced undergraduate and introductory graduate level, this essay examines Leff's notion that "a canonical group of texts" and common classroom experi ence provide the "bedrock" for a disciplinary rhetoric. To begin such an investi gation, we conducted a survey of introductory rhetoric textbooks used in class rooms across the university. The first section of this essay accordingly discusses the results of that survey and describes the disciplinary-based differences they imply. In the essay's second section, we use the results of this survey to examine the disciplinary status of rhetoric as it is handled in the textbooks themselves. We conclude by suggesting the ways in which scholars of rhetoric are disciplined?and divided?by the historical stories that these textbooks tell and by offering strategies for negotiating rhetoric's interdisciplinary status. Surveying Our Choices: Introductory Rhetoric Texts For this survey we used a variety of methods to gather data: First, we requested information from those programs listed in the 1999 Rhetoric Review "Survey of Doctoral Programs in Rhetoric and Composition," and we solicited input from rhetoric-related listservs, including H-RHETOR, WPA-L, and WCENTER. We then searched for online syllabi from programs not otherwise represented in this study. The survey instrument requested that respondents indicate what introductory or survey rhetoric courses their departments offer, the course levels (advanced undergraduate/graduate4), and what textbooks have</page><page sequence="5">Surveying the Stories We Tell 189 Table 1 Affiliations of Departments Reporting Data Department No. of Courses English 40 Communication 17 Humanities 2 Arts &amp; Sciences 1 Unknown 2 been used in these courses. The instrument also provided a place for discursive comments. From these diverse means, we gathered usable information about sixty-two courses at fifty-one colleges and universities.5 Course data were gathered from the departments shown in Table 1. As Table 1 indicates, the majority of the data came from departments of English, and as a result of this bias, the results of this survey are by no means definitive. Nevertheless, given the frequency with which the most popular texts were cited?and the minimal disciplinary overlap these texts evidence?distinct trends emerge from the data (see Table 2). What Table 2 shows is, on the face of it, unsurprising: English professors tend to adopt textbooks written by English professors, such as Patricia Bizzell, Edward P. J. Corbett, Robert Connors, Sharon Crowley, and Bruce Herzberg. By contrast, communication professors adopt texts penned by their disciplinary colleagues: Goodwin F Berquist, Thomas Conley, Karen Foss, Sonia Foss, James L. Golden, James A. Herrick, J. Michael Sproule, and Robert Trapp. Table 2 Texts Reported by More than One Respondent6 Textbook Communication English Total The Rhetorical Tradition, Bizzell and Herzberg 0 18 18 The History and Theory of Rhetoric, Herrick 4 3 7 The Rhetoric of Western Thought, Golden, Berquist, 5 0 5 Coleman, and Sproule Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student, Corbett and 1 3 4 Conners Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric, Foss, Foss, and 3 0 3 Trapp Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students, Crowley 0 3 3 Classical Rhetoric in the European Tradition, Conley 2 0 2</page><page sequence="6">190 Rhetoric Review The notable exceptions to this rule are those English departments that adopted Herrick's The History and Theory of Rhetoric. Its cross-departmental use might be explained partially by the fact that Herrick's text was only reported by English classes at the undergraduate level. This popularity suggests that the survey approach and brevity of Herrick's text?301 pages to The Rhetorical Tradition's 1,470 pages and The Rhetoric of Western Thought's 527 pages? might be exceptionally well suited to undergraduate classes. Aside from Herrick's book, with the exception of the single communication class that adopted Corbett and Connors' Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student, all other textbooks were adopted by the authors' departmental peers. The results from this study are not only useful in establishing a depart mental correlation between authors and teachers. Comparing the range of historical accounts in these texts also suggests pedagogical differences in the way communication and English scholars present rhetorical theory in the class room and reveals a surprising level of division in rhetoric's modern (interdis ciplinary status. Focusing on the three most-cited textbooks from this study? Bizzell and Herzberg 's The Rhetorical Tradition: Readings from Classical Times to the Present {The Rhetorical Tradition), Herrick's The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction {History and Theory), and Golden et al.'s The Rhetoric of Western Thought: From the Mediterranean World to the Global Setting {Western Thought)?simultaneously supports and undermines Leff and Lunsford's assertions concerning disciplinary rhetoric's shared "core of texts" and pedagogical concerns. Surveying the Formats: How They Tell the Stories Even before encountering the histories of rhetoric told by these three texts, the reader is struck by generic differences in the ways these stories are constructed. The Rhetorical Tradition's table of contents, for example, offers some clues as to why it is most commonly used by respondents in departments of English. Bizzell and Herzberg divide the history of rhetoric into periods familiar to literary scholars?classical, medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment, nineteenth century and modern and postmodern?and focus the subsections of these eras on specific authors. Thus the prefatory matter for the section titled "Nineteenth-Century Rhetoric" is followed by headnotes and primary text excerpts from individuals ranging from Richard Whately to Friedrich Nietzsche. This historical-period focus and author-oriented format should seem comfortingly familiar to many of Bizzell and Herzberg's English department colleagues because these individuals have long been used to author-and</page><page sequence="7">Surveying the Stories We Tell 191 period-structured literature and composition anthologies. As Jeffrey J. Williams describes, the anthology is a mainstay of the English department: Anthologies, it often seems, are ubiquitous in literature departments, bowing the shelves in our section of the campus bookstore and splayed open on the rows of desks in our large survey courses. They are a quintessential physical object of our academic environment, distinctive to the university [...] and to our discipline (other disci plines typically use introductory textbooks). ("Anthology" 197) By extension, using an anthology focused on historical periods and the "greats" of the rhetorical tradition gives the introduction to rhetoric course a structure and character similar to longstanding English department survey courses. Likewise, students familiar with classes of the Beowulf-to-Virginia Woolf variety will recognize the reading strategies needed to cope with these texts, for their education in the English department will have developed their abilities to move quickly across a wide range of authors, genres, and periods in a fifteen-week course. The Rhetorical Tradition, then, carries an embedded pedagogy akin to English department mainstays such as the Norton and Longman anthologies. Anthologizing the history of rhetoric has far-reaching pedagogical and ideo logical implications. This author-based approach not only provides students with a series of texts suited to the literacy skills related to textual analysis developed in other English classes but also, as Barbara Johnson argues, preserves some of the polyphonic character inherent to any theoretical tradition: [Organization by birthdate prevents the anthology from telling a continuous or overarching story?and is thus exactly the "raw" that prevents the anthology from getting excessively too cooked in any one way [...]. Organization by birthdate does not result from any interpretation?except, of course, the massive interpretation that this is an appropriate way to organize an anthology. (179) On the one hand, anthologies avoid establishing a singularly voiced narrative that recounts a monologic tradition. On the other hand, such collections' deference toward the notion of the author suppresses historical context and influence, "automatically biographizing [...] theory" and "ty[ing] it not to in tellectual dialectics or historical movements but to individual writers" (Johnson 179). As Laura Finke argues, even while preserving the author's prose, the</page><page sequence="8">192 Rhetoric Review very act of anthologizing contributes additional ideological connotations to these primary texts: [The anthology's] purpose is to provide a relatively inexpensive col lection of texts that might be used in a particular course. [...] In do ing so it reifies a series of cultural ideas about texts. [...] These texts are furthermore seen as the private property of the individuals credited with creating them, the fruits of their labor and their genius, seen as a quality that inheres entirely within the individual rather than the social relations structured by particular institutions. This format alone makes these documents seem disembodied outside human history and politics. (191) Finke's positive comment concerning the purpose of anthologies is certainly ap plicable to The Rhetorical Tradition. Indeed, this text not only offers a "rela tively inexpensive collection" but, by compiling a broad range of primary texts that are not otherwise readily available, it also provides an invaluable service to the field of rhetorical studies. Students would rarely be exposed to the works of a Robert of Basevorn or A. S. Hill were it not for their presence in this anthol ogy. However, Finke is not alone in arguing that the very focus on primary texts that is the anthology's strength may also produce less-positive pedagogical side effects. As Williams notes, such collections lend themselves to a "Romantic view of history, casting major theorists as great Romantic figures who are unique and individual, original and extraordinary [...]. History becomes anthropomorphized to a series of Great Men (and a few rare women)" ("Pack aging Theory" 286). We might call this the "theory-in-a-vacuum" effect. Such an effect would seem particularly inimical to a course focusing on the history of rhetoric where, presumably, some common course goals are (1) to teach rhetori cal theory in its historical context, (2) to relate the theories examined to their generating social and cultural circumstances, and (3) to connect developments in rhetorical theory to those rhetorical practices that they both codify and prescribe. In other words, when using a rhetoric anthology, care must be taken not to teach the theories it contains arhetorically. By contrast with Bizzell and Herzberg's emphasis on primary texts, those historically organized textbooks cited by communication instructors focus on survey, summary, and synthesis. Both History and Theory and Western Thought describe theory second-hand and do not include primary texts. As Carole Blair notes of the first three editions of Western Thought, such an approach can be read as an illustration of Douglas Ehninger's description of systems of rhetorics</page><page sequence="9">Surveying the Stories We Tell 193 (413). Indeed, the preface in the most recent edition of Western Thought overtly identifies this text with a systems approach: A rhetorical system is an organized set of generally understood ana lytical principles about communication that are practiced and taught in a given time and place. Only in a system of rhetoric does commu nication become a discipline distinct from philosophy, politics and ethics. That is, in a rhetorical system, rules and principles are comprehensively collected so that rhetoric can be deployed as an independent body of knowledge and can be taught according to consistently organized methods. (Golden et al. vii) Rather than associating the history of rhetoric with the author-function, Western Thought focuses on the relationships among theorists and describes complexes of ideas, arguing that only in this synthetic format does rhetoric become a "dis tinct" discipline, an assertion that sharply distinguishes this text from an anthol ogizing approach. Like Golden and his collaborators, Herrick also appears to take a systems approach to rhetorical history and theory, claiming, for example, that his goal is "to provide students with an interesting and accessible survey of the history of rhetoric, and to equip them with a conceptual framework for eval uating and practicing persuasive writing and speaking" (xi). Thus chapter one of History and Theory describes this "conceptual framework" in terms that recol lect Golden et al.'s definition of rhetoric's "consistently-organized method" (vii). Here Herrick introduces his readers to rhetoric by "presenting] the defining characteristics of rhetorical discourse," those qualities and elements that he argues can be used to understand the history of rhetoric (xi). Herrick's textbook, like Western Thought, seems less concerned with illuminating individual theorists than with describing networks of ideas. This systems-based approach is reflected in these texts' organizational schemes as well as their stated goals. For example, while maintaining a periodization frame similar to that of The Rhetorical Tradition, Western Thought is organized around the theoretical frameworks that form the system rather than historical periods or the theorists themselves. Part II of Western Thought, "Brit ish Continental Theory and Enlightenment Rhetoric," for instance, is not organized around authors and dates but around movements and "schools," with chapters like "Neoclassicism, the Belletristic Movement and the Rhetoric of Hugh Blair," "The Epistemologists," "Enlightenment Rhetoric in America," and "Women Emerge as Speakers: Nineteenth-Century Transformations of Women's Role in the Public Arena." Similarly, the chapter on "Rhetoric in Christian Europe" in History and Theory briskly surveys the "thousand years between</page><page sequence="10">194 Rhetoric Review A.D. 400 and 1400" (141) in twenty pages and under the larger framework of "Tension and Fragmentation" (121), a dual thematic that echoes other works like Vickers' Defence of Rhetoric (214) and Conley's Rhetoric in the European Tradition (73), though necessarily without the nuance exhibited in those longer works. Both Western Thought and History and Theory treat important authors such as Hugh Blair or Boethius in the context of theoretical movements, such as belletrism, or larger intellectual trends, such as the reduction and systemization of Greek and Roman works to increasingly narrow and prescriptive institutional ends. In contrast with Bizzell and Herzberg's author-based approach, this more topics-oriented format seems designed to introduce students to a manageable set of foundational concepts and themes that unify rhetorical study. The pedagogical apparatus of both History and Theory and Western Thought further supports this systems-based approach. In Bizzell and Herzberg's anthology, the apparatus for each section is limited to an historical introduction of approximately twenty-five pages and, for each author, a headnote, explanatory footnotes and a brief bibliography. Contrasting the com paratively unobtrusive approach of the anthology, both of the system-based textbooks include considerable apparatus materials designed to reinforce the authors' narratives of rhetorical development and so provide students with an explicit model for creating connections among individual theorists. Each chap ter of History and Theory includes, for example, "Questions for Review," "Questions for Discussion" and "Key Terms" to reinforce the ideas central to the material covered. Likewise, Western Thought includes summaries titled "Major Figures" and "Key Concepts" in its chapters. Similarly, both textbooks use formatting qualities, such as sidebars, subheadings, and boldface to fore ground central concepts. If in The Rhetorical Tradition the reader is introduced to rhetoric as a field based on textual analysis and great thinkers, then the systems-based textbook presents broadly integrated, summarized theories of rhetoric for students to explore. Just as an anthology risks "automatically biographizing" theory (Johnson 179), however, so too a systems-based approach has intrinsic pedagogical hazards. Carole Blair, for example, argues that systems studies capture the history of rhetoric within standardized period divisions of intellectual history, raising the issues of whether these "systems" really are paradigmatic formulations of rhetoric and whether they capture the peculiarity or discreteness of rhetoric's history. [... SJystem studies are so encompassing that they mask the diver sity they claim to reveal. Although recognizing differences between systems, these histories elaborate no differences within systems.</page><page sequence="11">Surveying the Stories We Tell 195 Instead, they reduce the rhetorical theories contained in a system to a "dominant" or representative rhetoric ofthat system. (410-11) In contrast to anthologies of "Great Men (and a few rare women)," textbooks may offer context and comprehensiveness (Williams, "Packaging Theory" 286). Yet they may also lose important distinctions among individual theories, and they may elide the wide range of work that does not fit within "the system." The "fragmentation/systemization" theme evident in the chapters on Medieval/ Christian rhetoric in both History and Theory and Western Thought, for instance, emphasizes "a somewhat constricted and fragmented appropriation of the rich classical tradition" {History and Theory 123), which nevertheless "kept the clas sical tradition viable" {Western Thought 104). By focusing on the reinscription of classical elements in this manner, both textbooks necessarily marginalize work outside this thematic, including work by women, Islamic, or Byzantine scholars. In other words, in order to make history "accessible," systems text books must create a unified narrative that can be readily understood by novice scholars (Herrick xi). None of this will be surprising to readers of Hay den White, who argues that the writing of coherent history necessarily imposes upon the historian narrative constraints and choices as they seek to fit a chronological series of "facts" into a narrative form. And these constraints and choices inevita bly introduce a second level of meaning into the narrative, a meaning that results from its formal pattern of emplotment (White 106-14). Even before turning to the substance of their histories, comparing the narra tive presentation of these three texts reveals their inherent (and unavoidable) pedagogical biases. An anthology offers students the opportunity to cope with a range of texts and a firsthand introduction to key thinkers in the rhetorical tradi tion, albeit sometimes by minimizing cultural contexts and noncanonical works and trends. Systems textbooks, however, offer conceptual summaries and histori cal contexts that synthesize large-scale periods and regions, though often at the cost of specificity and diversity. There are also biases that seem to cut across genres, for neither systems textbooks nor anthologies seem particularly amena ble to the inclusion of many examples of rhetorical practice or the foregrounding of those material conditions, technologies, media, and genres that inform theory and practice. The pedagogical difference between anthologies and textbooks would seem to offer students a different understanding of "theory" itself: In the anthology a theory appears as the construct of a single author, originating in the mind of the individual. Such an orientation preserves notions of Romantic genius and intel lectual ownership by focusing students on what Gorgias or Hugh Blair "thinks." In systems textbooks a theory is an interrelated nexus of ideas that arise with a</page><page sequence="12">196 Rhetoric Review "system" and can be effectively summarized by a third party. Here then, theory is not the property of an originating mind but results through the use of a terministic screen of conceptual definitions. Such an approach focuses student attention on what sophism or belletrism "is." While either approach can be effective for first introducing students to the history of rhetoric and while no approach will avoid bias, a distinct, albeit unstated, definition of theory emerges from each approach, and these definitions, we argue, are tied to disciplinary differences in the way rhetoric is taught. Further, these conceptual differences among definitions of "rhetoric" and "theory" require different learning activities on the part of the student. When reading the anthology, the primary learning strategies relate to textual interpreta tion?an activity supported by the editors' headnotes and footnotes. By contrast, textbooks require students to familiarize themselves with the authors' account of theoretical constructs, and mastery of this material is supported by the pedagogi cal apparatus in these textbooks. Thus our selection of course materials for the introductory rhetoric class influences both the way in which the history of rheto ric is communicated, how the notion of "rhetoric" itself is understood, and what types of knowledge we will require from our students. Considering these pedagogical differences in light of the disciplinary biases suggested by our survey implies that while scholars in communication and English might all be concerned with rhetoric's history, we are often?at least initially?members of different interpretative communities. This pedagogical disparity does not deny assertions of rhetoric's interdisci plinary status. As Leff rightly notes, there is considerable overlap in the theories that concern scholars in departments of English and Communication as repre sented, for example, by those uses of History and Theory cited by English de partments. As might be expected then, a review of the contents of all three texts reveals the "common core of texts" Leff cites (Lunsford and Leff, "Theoretical and Practical" par. 5). More surprising, however, is the interdisciplinary erasure of disciplinarity?and its attendant focus on pedagogy?from the treatment of contemporary rhetoric in all three works. Surveying the Contents: What Stories They Tell Reviewing these textbooks, it becomes evident that their contents support, at least in part, the assertion that a unified canon underlies rhetoric's departmental variations. That is, while The Rhetorical Tradition excerpts and History and Theory and Western Thought summarize, all three texts have several theorists in common (see Table 3).</page><page sequence="13">Surveying the Stories We Tell 197 Table 3 Theorists Considered in All Three Texts7 Classical/Early Christian Enlightenment Contemporary Gorgias Ramus Burke Aspasia Vico Weaver Isocrates Campbell Toulmin Plato Blair Perelman Aristotle Whately Foucault Cicero Quintilian Longinus Augustine While this comparison suggests that rhetoricians in English and communi cation share a common group of texts, underneath this similarity is a growing trend toward disparity. Admittedly, in the classical period, there is considerable overlap in what all three textbooks cover, and the authors seem to share a vision of the key theorists in this period. In contemporary rhetoric, however, there is considerably more divergence of opinion concerning what constitutes an "important" theorist. Indeed, the relatively small "common core" appears even smaller when considering the number of twentieth-century theorists included in each text. In all three volumes, twentieth-century rhetoric is one of the larger subsections. Almost half of Western Thought is devoted to twenti eth-century rhetoric, for example; and in both History and Theory and The Rhetorical Tradition, only the classical section receives more space than does contemporary rhetoric. When discussing modern developments, each of these histories includes an extremely broad range of theorists. From Herrick's discussion of "Deirdre McCloskey and the Rhetoric of Economics" to Golden et al.'s consideration of "Michael Meyer and a Problematic Theory of Rhetoric" to Bizzell and Herzberg's inclusion of H?l?ne Cixous' "The Laugh of the Medusa," each of these textbooks charts a different narrative for contemporary rhetorical study. No doubt this variance is due in part to modern academics' mixed emotions about canon formation, as well as the fact that this is contemporary rhetoric. Simply put, not enough time has passed to see which works will have an enduring influ ence. More importantly, however, this divergence lays bare the fiction that any era can be reduced to one system defined by a few broad themes or to the contributions of a readily identifiable handful of remarkable individuals. A close examination of the modern history of rhetoric as told in these books reveals another reason for the disparity beyond the merely chronological; in all</page><page sequence="14">198 Rhetoric Review of these volumes, modern rhetoric moves away from disciplinary status and from pedagogy. In each instance from the classical through the Enlightenment and well into the nineteenth century, rhetoric is framed as a teaching subject whose ends are overtly pedagogical and whose means are set within disciplinary boundaries. All three volumes, for example, offer the sophists as the earliest teachers of rhetoric and discuss Plato, Aristotle, Isocrates, Cicero, and Quintilian in terms of their teaching and/or their visions of education. Likewise, all treat the role of rhetoric in Renaissance education, and in their considerations of the Enlightenment include the Elocutionary Movement and belletrism. As seen by this recurring focus on education, in all three volumes much of the history of rhetoric can be characterized by an enduring interest in how eloquence is taught, where it is taught, and by whom. Nevertheless, each text's description of contemporary rhetoric focuses on the philosophical framework rather than the pedagogical applications of rhetori cal study. All three histories are marked by a movement away from the educa tional and institutional context of rhetoric?rhetoric as the discipline that pro motes oral and written eloquence?to an emphasis on rhetoric as an attempt to explain how meaning is made and persuasion is achieved?rhetoric as the disci pline that theorizes oral and written communication. The modern theorists who receive attention in all three texts?including I. A. Richards, Kenneth Burke, Richard Weaver, Cha?m Perelman, Stephen Toulmin, and Michel Foucault?are represented as being more concerned with how language works than with how it is taught or learned. Likewise, many of those theorists who are dealt with in only one or two of the volumes under consideration?such as Jacques Derrida, Stanley Fish, Mikhail Bahktin, and Ernest Bormann?are shown to be more concerned with how meaning is made than with the best way to improve one's ability to make meaning. Each volume thus moves the scholarly gaze away from issues of pedagogy to focus instead on abstract language or sign theory. This movement of rhetoric into theoretical realms simultaneously under mines and supports the notion of a transdisciplinary rhetoric that finds a range of departmental homes. On the one hand, by detaching rhetoric from a single mode of written and/or oral communication, these books offer a range of theories (many articulated by scholars whose disciplinary affiliations lie outside rhetoric) that can be employed by scholars of language in a range of disciplines, and so provide a theoretical basis that can be shared across many departments. On the other hand, by freeing rhetoric from disciplinary fetters without acknowledging this move, these volumes bypass pesky questions of pedagogy and disciplinarity altogether. This leaves the reader ignorant of rhetoric's interdepartmental varia tions, its current institutional status, and its relationship to larger questions of language, power, and the making of knowledge.</page><page sequence="15">Surveying the Stories We Tell 199 Such is the case in Bizzell and Herzberg's The Rhetorical Tradition. The preface opens with the assertion that "[s]ince 1989, when we sent the first edi tion of The Rhetorical Tradition to the printers, there has been an explosion of new work on the history of rhetoric by scholars in classics, composition stud ies, English literature, history, philosophy, rhetoric and speech communication" (v). Yet they notify the reader on the next page that "given rhetoric's great di versity and the difficulty of representing it fully in an already lengthy collec tion, we have omitted the very recent work on rhetoric from the fields of com position studies, speech communication, and English" (vi). Omitting "very recent work" from the fields most immediately concerned with rhetoric means, in fact, omitting pedagogical concerns as well. Though Bizzell and Herzberg describe this "difficulty" as inherent to the "great diversity" of the field, it is of course their own predilections that lead the authors to include language theorists like Cixous and Bahktin but not educators like Mina Shaughnessy, Sondra Perl, or Mike Rose. Each of Rhetorical Tradition's first five sections?"Classical Rhetoric" through "Nineteenth-Century Rhetoric"?includes excerpts that treat rhetoric in an overtly pedagogical manner and so substantiate rhetoric's identification as a teaching subject in the volume's preface. Yet the selections included under the heading "Modern and Postmodern Rhetoric" turn away from matters of peda gogy and the classroom, focusing instead on abstract philosophies of language; the excerpts included in this section evince no particular interest in rhetoric as a teaching subject. Thus, while Bizzell and Herzberg acknowledge the twentieth century growth of communication and the rise of rhetoric and composition in the section's prefatory matter, the primary texts do not evidence this claim; rather, rhetoric appears to transcend its pragmatic pedagogical orientation for the universalizing sphere of theory. In those textbooks written by individuals with an affiliation to departments of Communication, contemporary rhetoric again transcends classroom matters for more abstract theoretical realms and so escapes disciplinary difficulties. For example, in a move reminiscent of Bizzell and Herzberg's acknowledgement of interdisciplinarity, the authors of Western Thought claim that "[contemporary rhetoric is influenced not only by work in speech Communication and English but also by the incorporation of insights from critical social science" (237-38). Even as they acknowledge rhetoric's interdisciplinary state, neither disciplinarity nor rhetoric as a teaching subject makes an appearance in the second half of Western Thought. Likewise, History and Theory focuses its examination of contemporary rhetoric around systems that seem detached from questions of pedagogy and disciplinarity: "Arguments, Audiences and Advocacy"; "Rhetoric as Equipment for Living"; and "Texts, Power and Alternatives." Although both</page><page sequence="16">200 Rhetoric Review textbooks avoid issues of pedagogy to engage the "rhetorical turn" of the contemporary academy, neither takes up the interdisciplinary tensions that help to define contemporary rhetorical study. While these editorial choices of all three volumes can be interpreted as an accurate reflection of the "rhetorical turn," this shift in emphasis nevertheless re sults in an oddly adisciplinary discipline. By removing rhetoric's pedagogical concerns, all three volumes free rhetoric from any classroom, English or com munication. While this move might have the effect of broadening rhetoric's scope by including theories that bring new insight to rhetorical studies across the curriculum, it also serves to suppress those issues of interdisciplinarity, peda gogy, and practice that are integral to contemporary rhetorical study. Through its textbooks contemporary rhetoric presents itself as separate from any pedagogical concerns or disciplinary affiliations. But unlike the epigraph to this essay, the rhetoric of these anthologies and textbooks has no heroes or villains; rather, it appears to have escaped into the theoretical ether and so avoids the inevitable frictions of interdisciplinarity altogether. To note the pedagogical qualities that unite and divide these textbooks is not to denigrate their value. We do not offer this analysis of the rhetoric of our class room histories of rhetoric to question the obvious value of those intellectually influential and pedagogically useful textbooks considered here or to deny their substantial contribution to our field. Indeed, as one reviewer of an earlier draft of this essay rightfully reminded us, the sorts of exclusions, emphases, and theoret ical biases we discuss in this essay are inevitable, for "when we produce histo ries of rhetoric, there are choices to be made." And these choices will be deter mined in part by the kind of story we want to tell and the way in which we tell it: We either anthologize and risk not presenting adequate historical context and connections with other literature (and all the other risks that go with identifying a canon), or we create our own way of mak ing sense of history, and risk being described as a "system." True enough, all textbooks will have "biases." Heck, all language-use is biased and partial. The question is how can we improve what we are doing? ("Review," n.p.) As in this reviewer's comments on the inherent nature of bias, we too assume that every textbook will inevitably have an embedded pedagogy. However, the pedagogies implicit in an authorial-based or systems-based approach to rhetoric are not flaws in these texts' construction, for they are the very foundations of these volumes' success and provide our students with a necessary entry point to our professional conversations. Rather, we argue that increased attention to our</page><page sequence="17">Surveying the Stories We Tell 201 textbooks' own rhetoricity provides scholars of rhetoric a departure point for discussing the differences of our disciplinary perspectives and the grounds for understanding what the disciplinary permutations of rhetoric can offer to one another. In a similar vein, attention to the pedagogy of our histories of rhetoric from teachers and textbooks authors offers students a fuller understanding of rhetoric's contemporary configurations, as well as an immediate artifact for rhetorical analysis and critique?the textbooks themselves. Or, to return to the trope with which we began, only by realizing what histories necessarily suppress in their attempts to present a coherent narrative will teachers and textbook authors understand which familial stories we need to expand and explain, to assure to that the next generation fully appreciates the richness and variety of the family into which they are marrying. Notes lrThe authors would like to thank peer reviewers Janice Lauer and Edward Schiappa as well as RR editor Theresa Enos. 2The subject of much debate in contemporary rhetorical study, David Fleming concisely defines, "Big Rhetoric" as the "globalized metadiscourse oriented to the interpretation and criticism of symbolic inducement in all its forms and settings" (171). For further discussion of the issues surrounding this term, see Gaonkar; McCloskey; and Leff "Modern." 3Petraglia and Bahri's recent Realms of Rhetoric examines the topic of rhetorical education and disciplinarity by attempting to "reflect and further educators' current enthusiasm for a more theoreti cally informed curricular space for rhetoric instruction" (2). However, rather than focusing on the pedagogical implications or rhetoric's current interdisciplinary form, as does this essay, the contents of Realms of Rhetoric seem to be either broadly oriented to the revising of rhetoric's institutional locale(s) or specifically focused on case studies of individual courses. 4Originally, we included early undergraduate courses in our data analysis. However, the responses we received on this topic primarily dealt with freshmen composition and so were omitted. 5Omitted from this analysis are incomplete responses and responses concerning graduate-level composition pedagogy courses and undergraduate general education writing requirements. ^Omitted from this table are textbooks cited by only one respondent and customized course packs, which are outside the scope of this study. 7Rather than referring to all works merely cited in all three texts, "Considered" here designates those theorists whose ideas are dealt with in some detail. In Bizzell and Herzberg, for example, this group is defined as those theorists whose work is excerpted. In Herrick and Golden et al,, this designation refers to those authors whose work is the focus of a chapter or subsection of a chapter or whose contributions are foregrounded in the textbooks' pedagogical apparatus.
