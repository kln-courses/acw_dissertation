Rather than endorsing the continued attempt to define Art with a capital A in terms of aesthetic experience, I recommend alternative lines of research for contemporary philosophers of the arts. Keywords: Modern System of the Arts, the aesthetic theory of art, Monroe Beardsley, Gary Iseminger, the aesthetic function of art. Introduction The shaping influence of the eighteenth century upon the contemporary philosophy of art and aesthetics continues to be momentous. If the animating questions of the philosophy of art, on the one hand, and of aesthetics, on the other hand, are, respectively, "What is art?" and "What is aesthetic experience?" then it is in the eighteenth century that these preoccupations came to the fore, and, in addition, some of the answers introduced in that period still command estimable philosophical alle giance. The question "What is art?" becomes pressing in the eighteenth century because once the Modern System of the Arts (a.k.a. the Fine Arts, the Beaux Arts, or just Art with a capital A) assembles itself, the philosopher wants to know what features something needs to possess in order to join this charmed circle. That is, as soon as poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and various other practices are taken to compose a distinctive domain, the question of what warrants membership in this exclusive club seems irresistible. Initially this was a question about what practices are Artistic practices (with a capital A), whereas nowadays philosophers frame the issue in terms of which works are Art (again, with a capital A). Nevertheless, I speculate that the origin of our current investigations into the definition of art first appears under the intellectual pressure to establish the criteria © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Lid</page><page sequence="2">158 NOEL CARROLL required to credential certain practices as full-fledged citizens of the Republic of Art (with a capital R and a capital A). It is also in the eighteenth century that a concern with the experience of beauty transmutes into the notion of aesthetic experience, which, although acknowledged to occasion objects of all sorts, including natural ones, comes to be associated especially with artworks, such as those produced by the practices that compose the Modern System of the Arts. Indeed, the association is so close that it has been suggested by some that the defining function of art is precisely that it is intended to afford or promote aesthetic experiences. This is called the aesthetic theory of art, and it is because of this theory that many are disposed to collapse the philosophy of art into aesthetics. For, on this view, the answer to the question "What is art?" is simply "something produced with an aesthetical intention, that is, an intention to afford or promote an aesthetic experience." This theory of art, of course, rests heavily upon its operative concep tion of aesthetic experience. And the most popular views of aesthetic experience abroad today still evince their eighteenth-century lineage in the notion of disinterested pleasure that has subsequently been etiolated even more vaguely into the idea of "experiences valued intrinsically for their own sake." This approach to the nature of art, as I will try to explain, has a number of attractions. But the concept of aesthetic experience on which it depends is exceedingly uninformative; indeed, as the title of this essay advertises, I believe it is a dead end. I do not, however, merely wish to argue that the very eighteenth century inclination of the aesthetic theory of art is a cul-de-sac. I also want to propose that the prospect, at this late date, of discovering a comprehensive defining-unity to the Modern System of the Arts seems unlikely, due to, among other things, the proliferation of novel art forms and the prolixity of the many avant-gardes. Instead, I will suggest that philosophical inquiry today would profit by starting to treat the various practices and genres corralled under the rubric of Art with a capital A as ars with a small a in the Latin sense (which, in turn, derives from the Greek notion of techne). That is, rather than asking "What is art?" we might ask, like Aristotle, "What is tragedy?" or "What is comedy?" as well as attending to the special features and problems of the specific practices under examination. This premodern reorientation of philosophical research will not only render the scope of our inquiries more manageable. It will also focus more exactly our analyses of our responses to the pertinent artworks. For, to advert to the example of Aristotle again, it is easier to develop a concrete sense of the ways in which emotions like pity and fear are engendered by drama than it is to get an operational handle on the aesthetic experience of any imaginable example of a work of art, properly so called. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="3">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 159 In order to make my own program sound attractive, I will need to tell you why I think the Enlightenment's Modern System of the Arts is obsolete and also why I maintain that the aesthetic theory of art, with its accompanying conception of aesthetic experience, is not up to repairing it. At the same time, I hope to make evident some of the advantages of, shall we call it, premodernism, a research program consonant with what Peter Kivy endorses as the philosophies of the arts.1 In Disarray: The Modern System of the Arts As is widely known, Paul Oscar Kristeller has argued that it is only in the eighteenth century that Art with a capital A began to enlist its core membership.2 That is, Art with a capital A is a modern idea. In premodern times, the arts were any practice whose exercise required skill, based upon training rather than solely upon some innate capacity.3 So, carpentry was an art, as were medicine, rhetoric, statesmanship, archery, and navigation. Often when these arts (with a small a, in the Latin sense) were sorted into different categories, the categorizations would be made on the basis of social status. For example, the liberal arts, such as rhetoric and grammar (and by extension poetry), were those associated with free men, while the contrasting practical or mechanical arts, such as armature, building, and agriculture, were associated with slaves or laborers. That is, the liberal arts were liberated—they were the arts to be cultivated by those who did not have to work by the sweat of their brow, as opposed to menial workers. Many of the arts that we today think of as card-carrying members of the Modern System of the Arts were previously classified as useful, or mechanical, or practical arts; painting, for example, was sometimes grouped with saddle-making, since saddles were painted. Even Vasari refers to painters as artificers rather than as artists.4 If the liberal arts were cerebral and/or theoretical, the mechanical arts, including painting, 1 Peter Kivy, Philosophies of the Arts: An Essay in Differences (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997).

" Following Raymond Geuss, I define a skill as "an ability to act in a flexible way that is responsive to features of a given environment with the result that action or interaction is enhanced or facilitated, or the environment is transformed in ways that are positively valued." Moreover, that ability is learned and rests upon the body of practice, know-how, and norms associated with the art and acquired by training.

In 1747, Abbe Charles Batteux wrote a treatise entitled Les Beaux Arts reduits a un meme principe (The Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle). Batteux wrote: "We will define painting, sculpture, and dance as the imitation of beautiful nature conveyed through colors, through relief, and through attitudes. And music and poetry are the imitation of beautiful nature conveyed through sounds, or through measured discourse."6 Here, of course, the principle that unifies these practices under the same umbrella concept is the imitation of beautiful nature or the imitation of the beautiful in nature. The idea of the imitation of nature, on this view, derives from the Platonic-Aristotelian identification of poetry and painting as essentially arts of imitation, or mimesis. But the beautiful in nature that the arts are intended to portray also would appear to suggest a Platonic residue, or at least a Neoplatonic one. The beauty in question is most likely to be understood as the perfection, or completion, or idealization of nature. It is that which, Plotinus maintains, is accordant with the Ideal Form, which when stamped upon common shapes "gathers into unity what still remains fragmentary, catches it up and carries it within, no longer a thing of parts, and presents it to the Ideal-Principle as something concordant and congenial" (Enneads\.63).7 The pertinent arts, on Plotinus's view, do not simply "imitate the visible world, but refer back to the emanation [logoi] from which nature derives" (Enneads 5.8.1). The beautiful in nature is, so to speak, a construct. As Alberti suggests, "Excellent parts should be selected from the most beautiful bodies and every effort should be made to perceive, understand, and express beauty."8 The tree in my garden, in other words, will never exemplify the Idea of tree-ness inasmuch as it will suffer the wavering material vicissitudes of wind, weather, and water. But the artist can offer us a more perfect approximation of the ideal. And that is what is involved in the imitation of the beautiful in nature—it provides us with a glimpse of reality, with Indeed, artists of the Renaissance whom we count as Artists with a capital A were often also engaged in pursuits that we would not readily count as fine arts, such as military engineering, casting armor, and designing sugar sculptures. That is, painters and sculptors of the period did not regard those activities as utterly distinct from what—by the lights of the Modern System of the Arts—we might consider their more mundane labors. 6 Abbe Charles Batteux, Les Beaux-Arts recluits a un meme principe, ed.

Goethe says, for example: "The highest demand made on artists is this: that he be true to nature, that he study her, imitate her and produce something that resembles her phenomena," where he goes on to indicate that the resemblance pertains to the deep character of the phenomena, not their surface appearance.9 The Fine Arts or the Beaux Arts—poetry (presumably including theater), music, painting, sculpture, and dance—belong together concep tually, since they, by their different means, share this common function. Moreover, insofar as this view assigns the relevant arts a cerebral or theoretical mission—the disclosure of the true nature of reality—this approach hives those arts off from the merely mechanical ones. According to commentators like Kristeller, this way of organizing the arts was not common before Batteux. Comparisons between the arts under discussion were often only pairwise—as in the cases of Plato, Aristotle, and Horace. In the Renaissance, comparisons between painting and poetry occurred, but often in the context of attempting to bolster the social status of painters and painting. Artist-writers like Alberti and Leonardo desperately wanted to garner respect for their profession. To this end, they employed a number of strategies. They showed, for instance, that the painter possesses the kind of knowledge, like knowledge of geometry, that was associated with the liberal arts, and, therefore, presumably the painter should be counted among the gentlefolk. Moreover, artist-writers of the period produced theoretical treatises, another mark of the liberal arts. And, of greatest significance for my purposes, painting was frequently compared to poetry. In his 1390 treatise II libro del arte, the Florentine painter Cennino Cennini argues that painting is second only to poetry among the arts because both painters and poets have the power to reconstruct reality (King 2007, 256). Leonardo went further and drew the comparison to the benefit of painting, rating painting higher than poetry.10 In the pursuit of status, sculpture then followed the lead of painting. In his 1504 treatise De sculptura, Pomponio Gaurico links sculpture and poetry by arguing "writers work in words and sculptors work with things: the former narrate while the latter portray and exhibit" (King 2007, 274). Of course, underlying these comparisons is the idea that if poetry has an elevated cultural status as a liberal art, then so should the arts that are either abundantly like it or that outdo it on its own terms. Comparisons 9 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, "Introduction to the Propylden (1798)," in Goethe on Art, selected, edited, and translated by John Gage, pp. 3-17 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980), pp. 6-7. 10 Leonardo da Vinci, The Notebooks of Leonardo ila Vinci (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 201. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="6">162 NOEL CARROLL between painting and poetry and between sculpture and poetry were ways of socially enfranchising these visual arts as something more than mechanical or manual arts, and of raising the symbolic capital of the artists who practiced them. Likewise, when Leonardo semisystematically compares painting not only to poetry but also to music and to sculp ture—finding painting superior to music in virtue of being more perma nent and superior to sculpture in terms of its ability to represent more aspects of things—he is not attempting to work out a principle that unifies these various endeavors; rather, he is clamoring for social recognition. But the creation of the Modern System of the Arts appears to be about something more than achieving status (although, as my discussion of dance will indicate, it was about that too). The Modern System was, in addition, presented as a theoretical discovery. Poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and dance, it was hypothesized, formed a kind unto themselves. Undoubtedly, previous ventures in comparing the arts, especially in terms of poetry, paved the way for this conjecture. I say this because poetry, as theorized by Aristotle and Plato in terms of imitation, appears to have fixed the framework for yoking these particular arts in a single category. Nevertheless, it took a philosophical leap to go from those comparisons to the generalization that founded the Modern System of the Arts. Furthermore, the generalization—that this group of arts specialized in imitation—seemed approximately accurate, at least for a short time. That is, much of the most prominent art around the time that the Modern System of the Arts was erected fitted the mimetic patent. For instance, most painting, sculpture, and poetry were imitative, as were the dominant musical forms with words, such as opera and song. Yet I only say "approximately accurate" here, because the very notion that a condition for membership in the church of modern muses was imitation also inspired some artists to reform and thereby transform their practices in that direction in order to be taken seriously. Choreography is an excellent example of this. For Adam Smith, dance was "a certain measured step ... which keeps time with, and, as it were, beats the measure of Music which accompanies and directs it."11 That is, for a philosopher like Smith, a country air or a social reel counts as dance, although it imitates nothing. Professional choreographers like Jean-Georges Noverre, however, realized that this conception of dance, given the cultural context, lessened its stature. And as a result, Noverre attempted to annex the Aristotelian conception of poetry as a theory of dance. This highly revisionist maneuver not only involves bracketing much social dancing from the order of ballet but also cashiers from its ranks much of the nonimitative jumping and scampering " Adam Smith, Essavs on Philosophical Subjects (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), p. 207. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="7">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 163 that audiences of Noverre's own day would have considered the epitome of theatrical dancing. Nevertheless, in spite of popular opinion, Noverre wrote, in 1760, in his Lettres sur la Danse et les Ballets that "I am of the opinion, then, that the name of ballet has been wrongly applied to such sumptuous entertainments, such splendid festivals which combine magnificent scen ery, wonderful machinery, rich and pompous costumes, charming poetry, music and declamation, seductive voices, brilliant artificial illumination, pleasing dances and divertissements, thrilling and perilous jumps, and feats of strength" (1975, 52). Instead, argued Noverre, "A well-composed ballet is a living picture of the passions, manners, ceremonies, and customs of all nations of the globe ... ; like the art of painting, it exacts a perfection the more difficult to acquire in that it is dependent on the faithful imitation of nature" (1975, 16). In his Lettres, Noverre explicitly acknowledges his debt to Aristotle and the reigning concept of imitation. At the same time, Noverre realizes that not everything that might be called dance by his contemporaries fell into what might be called the Art of dance with a capital A, that is, the dancing that belongs in the Modern System. In large part, that kind of dance remained to be created in the very image of the Modern System of the Arts, and, of course, Noverre himself was an major agent in that project, inventing as he did the so-called ballet d'action that served as the staple of the emerging Romantic Ballet that would come to reign over the early nineteenth century. Noverre, in effect, broadcast a self-fulfilling prophecy, using the defining feature of the Modern System of the Arts as his touchstone and thereby enfranchising theatrical dance as an Art with a capital A. Kivy has suggested that a similar story might be told about the evolution of program music. Program music became increasingly important in the eighteenth century, beginning with Johan Kuhnau's publication of his six Bible sonatas in 1700. Later examples include Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Couperin's Apotheoses. The development of program music was connected to the production of music for the ballet. But by the mid-eighteenth century, program music was being produced independently of the dance, as in the case of Ignazio Raimondi's Les aventures de Telemaque dans I'isle de Calypso, which was based on an epic poem by Fenelon. By taking on the function of narrative, Kivy speculates that composers, heretofore held in low esteem, were attempting to elevate themselves to the status of poets, a hypothesis perhaps partly confirmed by Liszt, who in coining the phrase "program music" spoke in terms of the articulation of a "poetic idea."12 12 The material on program music comes from Roger Scruton's "Programme Music: 1. The form and its meaning; and 2. History of the concept," in Grove Music Online, http:// www.grovemusic.com. Kivy's remarks were made at the Aesthetics Conference in Honor of Gary Iseminger at Carlton College on Oct. 20, 2007. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="8">164 NOEL CARROLL With some other relevant art forms, regimentation was perhaps less immediately urgent than with dance and program music. Poetry, whether narrative, dramatic, or lyrical, was generally representational, as, of course, was music with words; likewise, the most prominent painting and sculpture was imitative. Thus, the notion that what unified these practices was the imitation of the beautiful in nature seemed persuasive, by and large, while, at the same time, it also accorded these practices a certain dignity. For, insofar as they were in the business of disclosing nature shorn of the cluttering details of contingency, these practices could lay claim to subserving the quest for knowledge in a way parallel to the sciences. On the founding notion of the Modern System, the relevant practices were committed to revealing reality, as were the sciences. There can be no doubt, I think, that representation was the most important entry ticket into the Modern System. For, even when theorists like Lessing and Dubos attend to what differentiates the arts in the Modern System, what they focus upon is what the different arts represent best. Moreover, the emphasis on representation fitted well empirically with the art that surrounded audiences in the eighteenth century, while also, undoubtedly with the approval of Leonardo, placing these practices alongside the sciences in the knowledge game. No sooner is the Modern System of the Arts up and running, however, than both of these advantages begin to unravel. Internal to the System, the growing popularization of absolute music, as explicitly distinguished from program music, threatened the unity of the System, since most absolute music imitates nothing. Nor is this a minor anomaly, like nonimitative folk dancing, since pure orchestral, nonprogrammatic music quickly became a leading art form, one to which other artistic practices in the System were at least alleged to aspire. Thus, the System appeared imperiled from the inside virtually upon its arrival on the scene. But things are not working out in favor of the System externally either. For, by tying the reputation of the Modern System of the Arts to its capacity to deliver knowledge through representation, the arts were pitted in a losing competition with the natural sciences, whose breakthroughs from the seventeenth century onward, especially with reference to nature, manifestly dwarfed the contributions of the arts. Thus, the Modern System of the Arts started teetering almost as soon as it was erected. On my view, much of the subsequent development of the philosophy of art has most often involved the attempt to find a replacement for the notion of the imitation of nature or of representation that first rational ized the Modern System of the Arts. Most notably there have been two recurring strategies for repairing the unity of the Modern System. The first has involved versions of the expression theory of art, including Hegel's expression-of-history theory of art, but, more often than not, perhaps under the influence of Romanticism, these theories have been © 2009 The Author Journal compilation £) 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="9">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 165 about the expression of the various mental states of individual artists. The second strategy is what I previously called the aesthetic theories of art. It is my contention that both these approaches have failed to find some principle of unity for the Modern System of the Arts. The reason is that the Modern System of the Arts is no longer a system. Indeed, in my estimation, it was a barely a system in the first instance, since it ignored various claimants for theoretical attention, such as nonimitative dance, but even in this unstable state it only lasted very briefly. And since that time, the prospects for repairing the incongruities among the practices thought to be within the ambit of Art with a capital A have dwindled exponentially. Rather, the so-called system is by now at best a collection of disparate practices whose actual unity is historical. What we now recognize as members of the Modern Collection of arts are practices that are genealogically related to those practices that once at least fleetingly appeared to have a generally shared function in the eighteenth century. Since that time, no other shared function of comparable persuasiveness has been identified. And that is a fact that the philosophy of art needs to negotiate by retooling itself in terms of the philosophies of the arts (where being one of the relevant arts is to be determined by means of historical narration). Yet before I say anything further about this, I need to indicate why I think that neither expression theories nor aesthetic theories can make sense of what we still call, if only honorifically, the Modern System of the Arts, which, to speak frankly, might be better labeled Our Inherited Collection of the arts. On the Failure to Reassemble Humpty-Dumpty According to Kafka's parable of "The Leopards in the Temple," "Leopards break into the temple and drink to the dregs what is in the sacrificial pitchers; this is repeated over and over again; finally it can be calculated in advance, and it becomes part of the ceremony."1 Likewise, since the eighteenth century philosophers of art have been indulging in an obsessional return to the origin of the Modern System that has become a ceremony, viz., the recurring search for some principle to relieve the obsolescence of the representational theory of art and to return order to the Modern System. As Deleuze and Guattari might put it, our inherited collection of arts has shot off rhizomatically in so many different directions—ones often chosen in explicit defiance of the theories of art that would pretend to organize them—that our almost compulsive reversion to these theories has effectively become ritualistic. The inven 13 Franz Kafka, Parables and Paradoxes, translated by E. Kaiser and E. Wilkins (New York: Schocken, 1961). © 2009 The Author Journal compilation @ 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="10">166 NOEL CARROLL tion of new art forms, like the cinema, video art, conceptual art, and so forth, and more than a century of avant-garde attempts to outrage not only the bourgeoisie but also the philosophers of art have made a shambles of the Modern System.14 We are living in its ruins. Of course, as noted previously, developments within the inaugural art forms had already challenged the Modern System, almost upon arrival. For it was difficult to incorporate a great deal of the pure orchestral music by means of the concept of imitation. Thus, if the Modern System was to be sustained, it would have to be founded upon some other principle. The notion of expression was one option, one encouraged by Roman ticism, and, indeed, it is probably still the most popular opinion regarding the nature of art among lay audiences. And it has also influenced many philosophers for at least half a century. It even served, more so than any other theory, as the philosophy of art that enfranchised film as an art form on all fours with the original members of the Modern System.15 Much of the ambitious art of the twentieth century, however, was created in ways that aspired to defeat expression theories of art. Conceptual artworks, found objects, and aleatoric art challenged the expression "theory of art" by devising strategies predicated upon severing the connection between the relevant mental states of artists and their artworks. The Dadaist Tristan Tzara made poems by cutting words out of newspaper articles, tossing them into a hat, and randomly drawing them out. The resulting concatenation could scarcely count as an expression of his emotions, if, indeed, he was feeling any. Nor could it help the expression theorist to protest that anything produced by a human being cannot avoid being an expression of the feelings of its maker, because (1) this is patently false and (2) if it were true, that would entail the existence of far too many artworks. I will not dwell on the shortcomings of the expression "theory of art," since it does not appear to be a pressing theoretical option at present. There is, however, a growing number of philosophers who still have faith that1 some form of the aesthetic theory of art can put the Modern System back together again. 14 For example, many of the novel art forms that have arrived on the scene—such as cinema, photography, and video—appear only to lay claim to art status, as in our earlier example of dance, by aping art forms already in the System. Cinema at first apes theater; photography, painting; and video, cinema. But after this first stage of imitating preexisting art forms, the new entries declare their independence from the art forms they initially copied, and they emphasize their differences from their forebears, often by exploiting what are allegedly unique features of the relevant media. This then leads to further refinements, revolutions, and counterrevolutions, branching off rhizomatically into many different programs, such that the art forms in question can only be related genealogically. 15 See, for example, Rudolf Arnheim, Film as An (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1956). © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="11">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 167 The aesthetic theory of art begins to take shape in the eighteenth century around the same time that the Modern System of the Arts is being cobbled together. The notion of disinterestedness, introduced by Shafts bury, is an initially important ingredient. Francis Hutcheson uses the idea of disinterested pleasure as the cornerstone of what we might call a proto aesthetic theory of art, although what it is, more precisely, is an aesthetic theory of beauty. On Hutcheson's account, beauty is a sensation, and the experience of beauty in response to an artwork is a feeling of disinterested pleasure triggered by a certain proportion of uniformity amid variety in the stimulating object. Kant agrees with Hutcheson that judgments of free beauty rest upon a subjective experience of disinterested pleasure that arises from the free play of the imagination and the understanding while attending to forms of finality. From here it but a short step—taken by popularizers, perhaps beginning with Benjamin Constant, who under stood Kant insufficiently—to an aesthetic theory of art, that is, to the contention that an artwork is such that it is intended to afford experiences of disinterested pleasure. This form of aestheticism corresponded neatly with changes in the patterns of consuming art that occurred as the bourgeoisie were becoming an important part of the clientele for art. In premodern times, the primary consumers of art had been very imposing social players: the monarchy, the aristocracy, the church, the guilds, the municipalities, and so forth. These patrons commissioned artworks to serve important social pur poses: to honor the monarch, to instill loyalty or obedience, to preach the commandments, to commemorate historical achievements and sacrifices, and so on.16 In contrast, the rising bourgeois classes, with increasing amounts of leisure at their disposal, frequently looked to the arts as a delightful way of passing time. Although people continued to use the arts for ends other than amusement, the association, which was evolving in theory, of the arts with beauty, of beauty with pleasure, and of the arts as a source of that pleasure, also nicely fitted the new patterns of consumption. Of course, as a matter of definition, the connection between art and pleasure was obviously inadequate. Pleasure is not a necessary condition for art. Think of all those altarpieces of the crucified Christ. They were not meant to instill pleasure in the hearts of the faithful, nor did they. Likewise, innumerable visions of hell, though undeniably art, were clearly intended to provoke not gladness but horror. Nor was pleasure, even disinterested pleasure, sufficient for art status, since so many other things, such as mathematics, could be said to impart it. 16 As also noted by Terry Eagleton in his The Meaning of Life: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 21. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="12">168 NOEL CARROLL Because disinterested pleasure was too narrow to cover the field, it was replaced by a more elastic concept, namely, that of aesthetic experience, understood as experiences valued for their own sake. Moreover, crucially, where Hutcheson and Kant had proposed disinterestedness as a condition for making judgments of taste, subsequent theorists made having disin terested experiences—experiences valued for their own sake—the point of engaging with things like artworks. Schopenhauer is a decisive moment in this transition, since for him aesthetic experiences liberate one from the mundane world of suffering and are occasioned by a feeling of release. This notion of aesthetic experience is then given a less Wagnerian inflection by Clive Bell, who domesticates it somewhat in his book Art. In Bell, one finds a distillation of the kind of thinking that we saw emerging from the eighteenth century and its redeployment in an aesthetic theory of art. For Bell, art is defined in terms of significant form (an echo of Kant's forms of finality), which is what gives rise to aesthetic emotion (a.k.a. aesthetic experience), which is itself said to be a release from ordinary, garden-variety emotions and the concerns and interests they serve. It remains for subsequent philosophers like Monroe Beardsley to attempt to weave the basic eighteenth-century elements of Bell's theory into an effective aesthetic definition of art. Although I am anything but a friend to this sort of theory, I do concede that it is undeniably alluring. Its keystone is the concept of aesthetic experience, experience valued for itself and not for any end that it might serve. By making this the essence of art, the aesthetic theorist, in the same breath, separates art from every other end (moral, cognitive, political, religious, and so forth), since the aim of art is an experience disconnected from everything else. Thus, aesthetic theorists appear to realize the goal of a successful analysis almost automatically by the choice of their central, defining concept. Moreover, the aesthetic theory of art offers an appealing, systematic set of answers to some of the most nagging questions in the philosophy of art. For example: What determines the degree of goodness of a work of art? The amount of aesthetic experience it affords. And: What counts as a reason for commending a work of art? Any feature of the work that contributes to its capacity to deliver aesthetic experiences. And so on. In fact, I would contend that due to its undeniable attractions the aesthetic theory has come to function as something like the superego of the analytic philosophy of art. Many of the unexplored, underexamined, or forbidden aspects of art under the analytic dispensation—such as authorial intention, art history, emotional arousal, morality, politics, and so on—have been exiled exactly because they are irrelevant from the perspective of the aesthetic theory of art. Even many philosophers who do not endorse the aesthetic theory of art explicitly nevertheless seem persuaded by arguments subtly based upon it—arguments with names like the intentional, genetic, and affective fallacies. @ 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="13">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 169 Stated in one of its best-known formulations, the aesthetic theory of art maintains that something is a work of art if and only if it is created with the primary intention to afford aesthetic experiences. This theory combines the eighteenth-century desire for a principle that defines art by means of a concept, aesthetic experience, which in turn also owes its provenance to the eighteenth century. Admittedly, this theory is very elegant. But it doesn't take much effort to show that this version of it is misguided. Much of what we call art was not created with the primary intention to afford aesthetic experience. Many objects that we regard as art objects were originally intended to be ritual objects, like the masks of the Dan people of Liberia; they were intended to be utilized rather than contem plated, and were discarded after they were used to wipe the blood off sacrificial blades after circumcisions.17 Some of what we recognize as art—like the images on tribal shields and war paint on the faces of warriors—is not meant to be delectated by invaders, it is meant to scare them away. The Maori invented a dance called the haka that involves stamping feet, beating the chest, bulging one's eyes, sticking out one's tongue, and so forth, for the purpose of sending intruders running for their lives rather than in order to entrance them in experiences that they would value for their own sake. Nor do we have to go to alien societies in order to find counterexamples to the claim that a necessary feature of art is that it be primarily intended to support aesthetic experiences. Innumer able religious paintings in our own culture were created to assist devotion, and their creators would have found it sacrilegious for them to be treated otherwise. In response, the aesthetic theorist might dilute the definition by dropping the qualification "primary." But then it may be hard to exclude very many contemporary, manufactured items from the order of art, since most of them are designed to afford, one way or another, some inkling of the sort of experience aesthetic philosophers would accept as meeting their requirements. Even toilet plungers are designer objects nowadays. I have one that looks like an abstract sculpture. So, jettisoning "primary" from the formula would entail a grievous loss of definitional sufficiency. It would admit not only a flood of manufactured goods but also mathemat ical theorems that are elegantly contrived intentionally. Moreover, the concept of aesthetic experience that the aesthetic philosopher relies upon so heavily is also problematic. Clearly, it is not sufficient to pick out only art-relevant experiences, since if one accepts the notion of intrinsically valued experiences, there are many sources for them besides artworks, including ones involving controlled substances and sex. 17 Roy Harris, The Necessity of Art Talk (London: Continuum Books, 2003), p. 114. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="14">170 NOEL CARROLL Nor is it evident that aesthetic experiences must necessarily be experiences valued for their own sake. The classic case here is the student who attends to a work of art qua the kind of work it is, noticing all of its pertinent artistic features and understanding their relationships perfectly, but who does so solely in order to pass an examination. He values the experience, in other words, instrumentally, rather than for its own sake. Yet it would appear arbitrary to say the student did not have an aesthetic experience of the work. If he is focused with understanding on the relevant patterns in the music, what kind of experience could that be, if it is not an aesthetic experience? But perhaps an even deeper worry about the version of aesthetic experience on the table is that it is so empty and impoverished. Imagine trying to tell someone how to go about having an aesthetic experience. I can assist another person's understanding of a piece of dance by calling her attention to certain recurring patterns of figures and movements. I can show her what there is to look for and, thereby, how to begin to absorb herself in the choreography. But telling her to try to value the experience for its own sake is about as unhelpful a piece of advice as I can imagine. Although putatively pertaining to an appropriate mode of attention to artworks, the advice supplies no substantive guidance as to how one might do it. It is even less helpful than Bell's notion that such experiences are grounded in attention to significant form. In short, from the perspective of explaining how to appreciate art, the concept is nearly vacuous. Nor would it be of any service in attempting to design experiments regarding our responses to artworks, since the concept is so elusive. If this assessment of the aesthetic theory of art is correct, then we may have identified, along with the aesthetic theory of art, two other likely dead ends with respect to the legacy of Enlightenment Aesthetics: the project of defining art and the conception of aesthetic experience that legatees of the eighteenth century have mobilized to construct their theories. Before counting eighteenth-century aesthetics out, however, I am required by prudence to take the measure of the most recent and most powerful aesthetic theory of art available. Gary Iseminger's Theory of Art It might be suggested that my complaints about the aesthetic theory of art hit their mark so easily because I have chosen to assail a very weak version of it. Had I introduced a more formidable variant, it might be said, my objections would falter. The most thoughtful, indeed ingenious, and philosophically sophisticated aesthetic theory of art on offer to date has been proposed by Gary Iseminger in his book The Aesthetic Function of Art. So before declaring the Modern System of the Arts to be a dead end, one needs to confront Iseminger's reconstruction of it. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="15">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 171 For Iseminger, the task at hand is to specify the function of the art world, the arena of practice brought into existence by the crystallization of the Modern System of the Arts. He regards the art world as an artifact that came into existence with the christening of the Modern System sometime in the eighteenth century and that might go out of existence at some point. Like artifacts in general, the art world has a function. That function, according to Iseminger, is to promote aesthetic communication. For Iseminger, a communication is something that is designed to be understood. What is it that other people are intended to understand when the communication is aesthetic? Putatively: that whatever is communi cated is to be appreciated, where appreciation "is finding the experiencing of a state of affairs to be valuable in itself' (Iseminger 2004, 36). That is, I appreciate the experiencing of .* just in case I come to know noninferen tially that said experience is valuable in itself. The modern institution of art has been created to promote aesthetic communication by means of works that are understood as opportunities for appreciation, that is, experiences known noninferentially to be valuable in themselves. This then leads Iseminger to propose that works of art are good to the extent that they have the capacity perform their artifactual function, which in this case is to afford appreciation (2004, 22). Iseminger believes that this is the artifactual function of the art world not only because this is what the designers of the system had in mind but also because (1) this is what the art world does better than any other practice world and (2) because among all the things that the practice of the art world does, this is the function it performs better than any of the other functions it performs. For these reasons, Iseminger believes that the art world was literally designed in or around the eighteenth century to perform the function of promoting appreciation. The idea that this system was designed sounds strained, but Iseminger renders it somewhat more palatable by saying that all he is suggesting here is that there were and are people with this function in mind who have maintained and modified the system. But even though it is undeniable that there are people who have maintained and modified the system with this function in mind, it is doubtful that historically the eighteenth century founders of the system had the function of promoting aesthetic communication (in Iseminger's sense) in mind when the Modern System of the Arts was given birth. For as I pointed out at length earlier, the founding idea was that the practices in the Modern System were all devoted to the imitation of the beautiful in nature where beauty, as the idealization, the realization, or perfection and discovery of a form immanent in nature, was connected to the acquisition of knowledge that was not necessarily noninferential or noninstrumental. Of course, I would not want to deny that throughout the modern period there have been people who have maintained and modified the art world in the belief that the function of the art world is rather as Iseminger © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="16">172 NOEL CARROLL has it. Walter Pater comes to mind, for example. But for every Walter Pater, there has been at least one Leo Tolstoy who has plumped for a rival vision of the function of art. That is, the hypothesis that the animating function of the practice of art—even construed as our art or art of the modern period or just what we now say is art—has been a perennially contested one virtually from the inception of the modern system of the art world up to the present. I do not know whether there are more aesthetic maintainers of the art world historically than there are maintainers of opposing sorts (like Hege lians, Marxists, Thomists, constructivists, socialist realists, and progressives of every stripe), but the point is that they deserve to be accorded as much authority in identifying the function of the art world as do the aesthetes. Nevertheless, at the very least, if we heed historical voices other than those of the aesthetes, we will not find agreement from within the art world as to what it was designed to do. We will find a running controversy. Moreover, since Iseminger's conjecture about the function of the art world is a factual one, he cannot argue that the alternative functions, defended historically, can be discounted because they are conceptually unfounded. The pronouncements of all the maintainers and modifiers of the practice must be accepted—something that will probably result in the acknowledgment of a plurality of art world functions, rather than of one superordinate one. Indeed, since Iseminger's project is historical—the determination of the existing function of art—his apparent discounting of the ample testimony of artists and audiences who remain committed to a function for art alternative to his is disquieting. Isn't it rather like the skeptic who denies that shoemakers are involved in making footwear, despite the fact that this is what the shoemakers and their customers maintain? Surely the claims of many that art serves functions other than aesthetic commu nication cannot be ignored without comment. Of course, Iseminger will want to bolster his conjecture about the aesthetic function of art not only by claiming that the so-called designers of the system thought of it that way but also on the grounds that the art world is demonstrably good at discharging that function. But Iseminger's criteria of goodness are pretty steep, and I am not convinced that he is correct in maintaining that the aesthetic function of the art world scores well when weighed with his own scales. For a practice to be good at performing a certain function, it must acquit that function better than any other practice (call this interpractice success) and it must also be superior at implementing that function in comparison with every other function it performs (call this intrapractice success). However, I don't think that Iseminger can defend the aesthetic function of art on the basis of either of these criteria. With respect to interpractice success, why suppose that the practice of art affords appreciation better than the practice of nature appreciation © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="17">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 173 does? There is a nature-appreciation world, just as there is an art world. Certain places are set aside and marked off for special attention and carefully maintained. There are guided tours and books to assist the appreciation of nature. People travel far and wide to engage in the practice of nature appreciation, and their experiences provide the source of lively conversations, often supplemented by photographs and videos. Furthermore, nature appreciators meet the standards of Iseminger's account. For example, a nature appreciator may aver that she intrinsically values her experience of coming to know noninferentially that the Alps are sublime. There are even arguments that purport to show that the practice of nature appreciation is better at delivering the relevant experiences than is the art world, although it is enough for our purposes to maintain that there is no clear-cut winner here. Iseminger is prepared for this gambit. He contends that because nature lacks a creator, it affords a less rich range of qualities to appreciate. Nature, for example, putatively cannot be appreciated for its wit or its boldness. In fact, Iseminger goes so far as to suggest that the appreciation of nature alone would result in a relatively impoverished appreciative life. These responses, however, are controversial. Even if it is true that there are more qualities to be appreciated in art than in nature—a proposition about whose method of confirmation I don't think anyone has the slightest idea—what difference would that make, since the nature appreciators would undoubtedly counterclaim that experiencing the aspects of nature in question is more intrinsically valuable (for being more pure) when the experiences are carried off properly? And in any event, isn't it also likely that the nature appreciators will claim that there are appreciable properties that nature possesses beyond those available in art? In short, I predict at best a standoff here. Moreover, because nature appreciation frequently involves legitimate exercises in anthropomorphic imagining, it is not clear that we cannot call the swagger of penguins, if not witty, then at least funny; or, less contentiously, we can describe the upward thrust of a mountain peak as bold. Maybe almost anything art can do, nature can do—albeit anthropomorphically—if not better, then just as well. But then it is at least arguable that the practice of nature appreciation challenges the art world's claim to interpractice success. In response, Iseminger might claim that the function of art that he is talking about is aesthetic communication, and he may add that nature does not communicate to us. But remember, I am talking about the practice of nature appreciation—a practice in which nature lovers call to the attention of each other the appreciable aspects of nature by means of marking off and maintaining sites, by means of tours, photographs, essays, and so forth. As far as I can see, it is not obvious that this practice is inferior to the practice of art when it comes to alerting us to opportunities for appreciation. (Of course, at this point, you may be © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="18">174 NOEL CARROLL tempted to grumble that it's just silly to try to measure whether nature appreciation or the art world is better at signaling appreciative opportu nities. But if there is a problem here, it may be with Iseminger's methodology, since it mandates such comparisons).18 Iseminger also claims intrapractice success for the modern institution of the art world. That is, of all the functions that the art world can perform, the promotion of opportunities for aesthetic experience is the one it does best. He supports this conjecture by comparing the aesthetic function of the art world with a number of its other alleged functions, such as providing status markers. For this form of argumentation to win the day, however, Iseminger must be sure that he has canvassed all of the relevant competitors in the vicinity. But I think that he has neglected an extremely obvious candidate, and the omission of a discussion of this function of art seriously compromises his argument decisively. The candidate that I have in mind is the function of the art world to transmit and to reinforce the ethos of its culture. The arts, since time immemorial, have been a leading vehicle for inculcating in peoples the values, beliefs, examples, commitments, emotions, desires, behaviors, myths, morals, manners, ideals, feelings, and so on, that constitute the cultural order of society. By simultaneously addressing often, but not always, pleasurable perception, memory, emotions, and cognition with concrete images—that is, by engaging so many faculties of the whole person at once—the arts that compose the art world deeply embed the ethos of the culture in the very being of appropriately prepared recipients. By mixing sense and sentiment, feeling and information, the art world renders the ethos of a culture accessible to its members and also eminently retrievable for memory, insofar as it encodes that ethos across multiple faculties. The practice of the arts makes values perceptible to sight and audition, or, in the case of literature, it describes them by means of powerful, emotionally arresting, and memorable images, often in the form of exemplars. This is undoubtedly why every known society possesses the arts, and why the arts have survived for centuries. Many of the structures that lie at the center of the various art forms that constitute the Modern System of the Arts were evolved to perform the function of disseminating, maintaining, and buttressing the ethos of the pertinent cultures. Vivid imagery, rhyme, meter, alliteration, rhythm, music, dance, song, narrative, dramatic enactment, verisimilitude, and so forth, were developed to instill indelibly a society's wisdom and virtues in 18 Another practice that might compete with the art world as a resource for promoting aesthetic communication (in Iseminger's sense) might be the practice of single-player video games. Single players are invited to engage in experiences of amusement that they value intrinsically. They aren't paid to play these games and they need not be competing with other people. They may be simply entertaining themselves for the fun of it (valuing the experience for its own sake). How obvious is it that the art world is better at this than the game world? Probably not as obvious as Iseminger assumes. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="19">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 175 the hearts, minds, and memories of its citizenry. The art world in this respect is a key participant in the continuous reconstruction of the social order. It is highly likely that in large measure the art forms, and a great many of the artistic structures, that we have are a consequence of the socially adaptive purposes they serve in terms of promulgating, circulating, and sustaining the ethos of their home cultures. Surely this is the reason why the practices that make up the Modern System have endured as long as they have. Moreover, I believe that the case can be made that the art world continues to perform this function. Indeed, in the age of mass art, it is very probable that the arts are fulfilling this function more comprehen sively and more effectively than ever before. There is no reason to suppose that this function of art, which we may call the communication of ethos or cultural communication—and which may, indeed, be the founding function of each of the members of the ensemble of practices we currently call the Arts—is not equal in efficacy to the function of aesthetic communication that Iseminger favors. If one function of a practice is better than another function that the practice exercises just in case the practice exercises that function more reliably, then the case can be made that the art world communicates culture better than it promotes aesthetic appreciation, since modest art works relay the ethos of the culture with far greater frequency than they curry apprecia tion. At the very least, Iseminger needs to demonstrate the error in thinking that the dissemination of the mores, the common sense, and the sentiment that constitute culture is a function that the art world achieves to a greater degree than its promotion of aesthetic communication. Unless this is done, the case for his revised aesthetic theory of art seems stalled. One objection that Iseminger might level at my candidate for the leading function of art is that it is not an artifactual function but what he calls a systemic function, a function that evolves rather than being self consciously made. However, since many of the practitioners of the arts in question have not only created works and even styles in order to disseminate the ethos of their culture but have also argued that this is what art should be doing, it seems unjustified to deny that communicating culture is not among the contenders for the title of the artifactual function of the art world. Of course, it may be the case that aesthetes use artifacts designed to broadcast the ethos of the culture for the kinds of appreciation that Iseminger has in mind, although that would appear to have little import with respect to what we take the objects in question to have been designed to do, as well as having no repercussions regarding the historical function of the practice in which the artifacts were produced. Nor can Iseminger argue that cultural communication is not an essential feature of the art world, since his argument is historical rather than conceptual, and who (Q 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="20">176 NOEL CARROLL can deny that cultural communication is not a genuine function of the practice of art? Let anyone who doubts this spend a few weeks in Rome. Furthermore, consideration of the function of the practice of art as a conduit of the ethos of a culture also invites us to reopen the discussion of that which the art world accomplishes to a greater degree than any other practice does. Iseminger awarded the interpractice success prize to the aesthetic function of art. But it is very plausible to suppose that there is no other practice that transmits the ethos of a people and acculturates its participants and/or audiences more expeditiously than the practice of art. It is widely believed, for instance, that the maxims, virtues, and ideals of a culture are more efficaciously taught by stories that provide gripping examples than by statements of the social creed like catechisms and moral treatises. Likewise the commitments, feelings, and folklore of a culture are more readily remembered through song than through almost any other medium. What examples like this suggest, moreover, is that it may be that the communication of culture (also known as the transmission of ethos) is the function that the practice of art excels in to an extent greater than any other comparable practice or institution. Unfortunately, Ise minger does not even explore this possibility, whereas I think that he needs to defeat it in order to defend his new version of the aesthetic theory of art. Of course, in denying that the aesthetic function of art is the function of art, I do not mean to suggest that it is not a function of the practice of art. For the practice of art or, even more narrowly, our practices of art perform a plurality of legitimate functions. If in the eighteenth century, for some brief spate of time, there was a System of the Arts reducible to a dominant function, that system soon gave way to a collection of different practices that, in my view, are now more profitably engaged on their own terms. Concluding Remarks Enlightenment Aesthetics have cast a long shadow over the field of the philosophy of art. In the eighteenth century, the Modern System of the Arts was convoked, thereby engendering the intellectual compulsion to discover the principle that held the system together. Thus, I speculate, the project of defining art was born. In addition, the eighteenth century evolved the concept of aesthetic experience, which suggested to many philosophers a key for solving the problem of defining art, namely: art is something that is produced with the intention to promote or afford aesthetic experience. This view whose prototype makes a fledgling appearance in the eighteenth century in Hutcheson's theory of beauty has been refined and defended in the contemporary philosophy of art by figures like Beardsley and Iseminger. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="21">LES CULS-DE-SAC OF ENLIGHTENMENT AESTHETICS 177 I have argued that even the most sophisticated versions of the aesthetic theory of art have failed. Insofar as such theories are descendants of Enlightenment Aesthetics, the aesthetic theory of art is one of the dead ends to which my title alludes. The problems of the aesthetic theory of art, moreover, add fuel to the suspicion that the project of defining art, another product of the eighteenth century, may itself also be a dead end. Indeed, I believe that it is, owing to the fact that what it is based upon—the Modern System of the Arts—is itself a blind alley. If there was a System of the Arts, rooted in a coherent principle, in the eighteenth century, that system has since broken down under the pressure of history. Among other things, its walls have been breached by ready mades and found objects. At this juncture, it makes more sense to recalibrate our inquiries in terms of the various arts (with a small a) that command our attention, asking about their functions and purposes, their means of discharging them, and the special problems these practices raise. In other words, as Kivy has urged, let us transform the philosophy of art into the philosophies of the arts. We have no reason to worry that we will be mistaken for philosophers of law if we give up the title of philosopher of art and call ourselves philosophers of music or of literature. All we will be forswearing is the responsibility we never mastered anyway, the definition of art with a capital A.19 Lastly, aesthetic experience, conceived of as an experience valued for its own sake, is also on my list of Enlightenment dead ends. Appearances notwithstanding, I do not think that it helps us construct a serviceable definition of art. Even less does this concept enhance our understanding of the nature of our engagements with works of art. For it is too thin a conception to do so. It has virtually no substance. It is too elusive to operationalize. I can tell you how to look at an impressionist painting in a way that will enable you to experience it appropriately. I can design experiments to ascertain which structures in musical works correlate with certain feelings rather than others. But I cannot tell you how to go about having an aesthetic experience of any unspecified kind of work of art whatsoever, nor can I test for variations in aesthetic experience when it is defined so abstractly or, less charitably, amorphously. Just as it may be more instructive to speak of categories of artworks rather than Art with a capital A, I suspect that we will learn a 19 Another advantage in speaking of the philosophies of arts, rather than of Art, is that it will dissolve the perplexing question of the identification of so-called first-art, which bedevils the family-resemblance approach, as well as other approaches, to the question of sorting the Art from the Non-art. For even if there is a problem in principle with naming the first work of Art with a capital A on some theories, the problem is not so daunting when it comes to identifying the earliest sculptures or protosculptures. Needless to say, I am not claiming that this can be accomplished empirically; 1 am only suggesting that it is not a theoretical impossibility, as it might appear to be on certain proposals regarding the application on the concept of art with a capital A to the relevant objects and performances. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation @ 2009 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="22">178 NOEL CARROLL great deal more by focusing on our responses to kinds of artworks rather than artworks bereft of functional and structural differentiation—that is to say, in terms of aesthetic experience, as that notion has come down to us from the eighteenth century. Of course, we need not focus exclusively upon the nature, problems, and responses that pertain to all and only singular art forms. Some problems (like the paradox of fiction) and some of our responses to artworks (like suspense) may cross art forms and can be comparatively studied and theorized with profit. Rather, my point is that we should not proceed under the assumption that the pertinent philosophical problems will apply to all of the arts that concern us, and we should not presuppose that there is some single response, affective state, or experience that every art form is designed to deliver.20 That is, if we endeavor to make statements across a range of artistic practices about art forms and the responses they engender, we should proceed from the bottom up and bracket the presumption that there is a way from the top down.21 Philosophy Program Graduate Center City University of New York 365 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10016 USA Knollcarroll@gmail.com 20 A similar point is made in Aaron Meskin's "From Defining Art to Defining the Individual Arts: The Role of Theory in Defining the Individual Arts," in New Waves in Aesthetics, edited by K.
