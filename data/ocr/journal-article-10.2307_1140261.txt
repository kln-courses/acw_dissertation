<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABSTRACTS AND NOTES "OBSCENITY AND THE LAW" To the Editor: In Vol. 48, No. 3, September-October, 1957, of this Journal, there appeared an article by Henry H. Foster, Jr., Professor of Law, University of Pittsburgh, entitled, "The 'Comstock Load'-Ob- scenity and the Law;" Foster points out the di- lemma besetting the law in its attempt to shield society from obscenity, i.e., one can go far, even too far, in thought control and on the other hand, one must heed the established principle in criminal law to intercede only with overt conduct. Whatever the causal connection of obscenity with criminal conduct may be, the difficulty would be eased if we basically knew what obscenity is. Within our society as well as in practically all civilized nations the moral obligation is felt to pro- tect the growing human plant and sexual imma- turity at any age. In this Journal, Vol. 45, No. 3, 1954 and Vol. 47, No. 4, 1956, it was shown that there is a criterion by which to judge immature sexu- ality. This criterion was defined according to Freud's concept of the development of sexuality, published in 1905. The application of the criterion of pornog- raphy was shown and a number of verifiable con- crete factors were outlined. The criterion applies irrespective of the problem whether or not any causal relation exists between pornography and otherwise objectionable conduct. My papers were quoted in the Modern Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 6, May 6, 1957 of The American Law Institute, pp 32 and 43. Instead of familiarizing themselves with these facts, jurists, sociologists and others continue doing learned work which consists in rehashing again and again what Coke, Hale, Blackstone and other pre- historic and historic authorities have said. "Prehis- tory" in this field extends to the latest decision of the Supreme Court of The United States in which the new adjective, "purient," was added to the ven- erable array of adjectives used in former centuries such as "salacious," "lewd," "lurid," etc. (more adjectives can be found in the articles in "Obscen- ity and the Arts," Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. XX, No. 4, Autumn, 1955). It is a paradox worth noting that those who feel professionally antagonized by obscenity use the same array of adjectives without substance as do the pornog- raphers themselves. How long will lawyers go on limiting themselves to mere historical descriptions of the futile at- tempts to deal with the real problem! W. G. ELIASBERG Practicing Psychiatrist, New York City To the Editor: I cannot accept Dr. Eliasberg's anthropomorphic conception of Freud nor his evangelical certitude that an esoteric definition of pornography elimi- nates all of the problems pertaining to obscenity. From my point of view, which may be blurred, things are not black or white, but gray. His "cri- terion" for recognition of an appeal to sexual im- maturity seem amorphous and inevitably subjec- tive. I do not regard them as "facts." I agree that there may be a felt moral obligation "to protect the growing human plant and sexual immaturity at any age" but am impertinent enough to ask: "From what?" I also suspect that if Dr. Eliasberg gave a careful look he might find a sadistic element back of the "moral obligation." It is true that the drafters of the Model Penal Code cite one of Dr. Eliasberg's articles along with others by Karpman and Mead. But after citing different definitions of obscenity, the following con- clusion is reached: "However, although psychiatry in general gives insight into the significance of ob- scenity, the legal definition of obscenity cannot incorporate any specific psychiatric formulation, first, because there is no psychiatric concensus, and second because the legal test must be one reasonably within the power of ordinary citizens to understand, and of policemen and courts to apply" (emphasis supplied). Thus, after mature deliberation, the drafters rejected Dr. Eliasberg's magic formula due to the disagreement among experts and because it was believed unworkable. In answer to the query "How long will lawyers go on limiting themselves to mere historical de- scriptions of the futile attempts to deal with the 634</page><page sequence="2">ABSTRACTS AND NOTES real problem," all I can say is, I hope only so long as we are forced to do so due to the lack of cogent sociological and psychological data. There is a great need for a thorough and scholarly study of the causal relation, if any, between so-called ob- scenity and misconduct. That is the problem which many of us feel should be explored by our psy- chiatrist friends such as Dr. Eliasberg. We await their findings, and until they are received, I suspect we'll go along with our own inadequate definitions and continue our historical and sometimes analyti- cal studies. HENRY H. FOSTER, JR. Professor of Law, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa. International Congress on Social Defence--The Fifth International Congress on Social Defence will be held in Stockholm, August 25-30, 1958. The Fourth Congress was held at Milan in 1956. At that time the International Society for Social Defence received an invitation from the Swedish Minister of Justice to arrange to hold its Fifth Congress in 1958 in Stockholm. The council of the society has chosen as its subject: "Intervention, by the courts or by other authorities, in the case of socially maladjusted children and juveniles." In choosing this topic for discussion, the Society is continuing the studies entered upon at the Fourth Congress. During the first three congresses the general principles of social defence were dis- cussed, and the outcome of this was the adoption of a basic programme. At the fourth congress a study of more specific issues was initiated and the principles of social defence, that the Society in- tends to uphold, were applied to definite situations and practical problems. The topic chosen is undoubtedly one of very great importance both from a practical and a theo- retical point of view. In nearly all countries the problems concerning juvenile delinquency are be- coming steadily more acute. At their First Congress in Geneva in 1955 to discuss the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders, the United Nations very properly included on their agenda a debate upon the prevention of juvenile delin- quency. However, since the discussions in Geneva had to be kept within certain limits, the question as to the measures to be taken when an asocial act has been committed had to be postponed. Hence it seems appropriate that an international congress should now study this problem. The vital importance of these issues has prompted the choice of a topic for the Fifth Inter- national Congress on Social Defence, which pro- vides opportunities to exchange opinions upon the manner in which public authorities should inter- vene when the behaviour of a minor calls for their intervention. In formulating the topic, the council has avoided limiting it to the cases where a minor has com- mitted an offence or an act which would have been regarded as an offence if it has been committed by an adult. As the following comments will make clear, one issue to be studied is, in fact, whether it is desirable and, if so, to what extent, to restrict the interference of the authorities to cases of mis- behaviour of this nature, with regard to persons under a certain age. The topic chosen for the congress involves a whole series of problems; since, however, it is nec- essary that the congress should be able to reach conclusions within the limited time that will be at its disposal, the following three aspects of the sub- ject have been singled out for particular attention. 1. STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIALLY MALADJUSTED MINORS It seems suitable to discuss first of all the extent to which special provisions should be made regard- ing minors when a system of social protection is being drawn up. It is necessary to examine whether it is desirable to lay down an age limit below which young chil- dren should be free from intervention by public authorities. Furthermore the discussion should take up the question of an upper age limit above which the special measures for young persons should not be applicable, and of an age limit for the imposition of penalties or other measures proper to the ordinary administration of justice. It follows that the concept of criminal responsi- bility must be discussed. There is a tendency at the present day to do away with the concept of discernment in favour of a classification by age groups referring to the need of measures for re- habilitation and reassessment. This attitude gives rise to the question whether it is not convenient to examine separately for each measure its appro- priate application. The consequences of this view for the concept of criminal responsibility should be considered. The question arises whether the con- cept of a legal age of majority in criminal matters ought to be maintained. 1958] 635</page></plain_text>
