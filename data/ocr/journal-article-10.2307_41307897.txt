<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Folk to Popular and Back: Musical Feedback between Studio Recordings and Festival Dance-Songs in Uttarakhand, North India Stefan Fiol Abstract: Every day central Himalayan musicians travel to studios in east Delhi to record their own renditions of rural festival dance-songs. The resulting recordings, infused with studio techniques and sonic "folk " tropes , are distributed, consumed, and reinterpreted back in the mountain villages where they may reinvigorate festival dance-song performances and perhaps eventually stimulate new studio productions. This article ethnographically traces processes of musical feedback and influence between the urban recording studio and the rural festival, thereby complicating the routine dichotomization of musical life into categories of indigenous/ cosmopolitan, traditional/modern, or production/ consumption. Since the late 1970s, an increasing number of amateur and semiprofessional mu- sicians from the central Himalayan state of Uttarakhand have been performing in two distinct settings: rural mountain festivals and urban recording studios in Delhi, North India. One result of their exposure to both of these sites of musical activity has been a gradual adaptation of the festival musical repertoire, particu- larly round dance-songs, to regional commercial recordings collectively known as Uttarakhandi git (songs). These vernacular language recordings are dissemi- nated across plains-based urban migrant communities and mountain-dwelling village communities via radio stations, 24-hour television cable networks, and kiosks selling cassettes and video compact discs (VCDs). Some critics have ar- gued that Uttarakhandi git have gradually standardized and diluted regional culture, threatening the survival of village musical traditions. While these con- cerns are understandable, commercial recordings have also generated consider- able public interest in village music and dance, and they have become a direct source for learning the dance-song repertoire that is performed at rural festivals. This article explores musical communication across festival and studio set- tings with particular attention to round dance-song genres. Many other styles of village music - panwara, jagar, Baddi git, and mangal git - have been recorded in Delhi studios and transformed through this process, but these recordings' re- ciprocal influence on village practice has been negligible.1 Small-scale producers Â© 2011 by the University of Texas Press, P.O. Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713-7819</page><page sequence="2">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 25 have tended to release these albums in low volume, with limited distribution in the mountains. Moreover, these are specialist genres rooted in ritual practice and performed by predominantly hereditary caste-musicians who have had little exposure to commercial music. In contrast, Uttarakhandis of all geographic and social backgrounds actively participate in round dance-songs during com- munal gatherings, and the genres themselves facilitate widespread participation by being open-ended, repetitive, flexible, and inclusive of secular and sacred interpretations. By shifting between ethnographic examples in studio and festival locations, this article explores the circular process whereby commercial recordings be- come a source of creativity for festival dance- song performances, and the latter become a source of creativity for recording studio projects. Despite the neat- ness of this formulation, there is no grand, circular design in the minds of most studio or festival participants. The opinion of many Uttarakhandis is that the rural festival and urban recording studio are spaces of traditional and modern musical production, respectively, and that whatever comes out of one setting is neither appropriate nor intended for the other setting. This perspective emerges not so much from a belief that the musical values or styles in studio and festival settings are incompatible but rather from a widely shared modernist discourse through which cultural practices, forms, and spaces acquire dichotomous meanings as global/local, modern/traditional, or popular/folk. The ideological polarization of festival and studio performance is mediated by geographical distance in the case of Uttarakhand but also by the historical context of rela- tions between mountain villages and urban centers in the North Indian plains. Until the nineteenth century, Uttarakhand was an important center of trans- Himalayan trade, agriculture, and mining. Once ceded by the British Raj in 1815, the regions strategic importance was measured less in terms of its produc- tive capabilities and more in terms of its geographic features as a buffer zone against Soviet and Chinese threats, as an alpine retreat from the sweltering heat of lowland summers, and as a source of resource extraction for plains-based development projects (Rangan 2000). Throughout the ninteenth century, by necessity or choice, increasing numbers of Uttarakhandi males migrated south to the urban plains for military service and educational and employment op- portunities. The plains came to be imagined as a place of opportunity and status elevation, in spite of the considerable economic uncertainty, social alienation, and discrimination that Uttarakhandis faced in this environment. Writing in 1828, the British commissioner to Kumaon, G. W. Traill, remarked, "The rate of wages [in the hills], greater by one half than that which exists in the plains, fails in inducing the voluntary attendance of day laborers: the people of this class will, however, without hesitation wander hundreds of miles, and spend weeks to gain a few annas by peddling the commodities of the plains" (1991, 138).</page><page sequence="3">26 Asian Music: Winter/ Spring 201 1 Following national independence in 1947 and the dissolution of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal, the western and eastern halves of Uttarakhand (Kumaon and Garhwal) were administratively conjoined under the state government of Uttar Pradesh. The male migrant population had become so large and so desta- bilizing to the region that many observers wrote of a "money order economy" in Uttarakhand.2 In response to the threat of a Chinese military invasion in the early 1960s, the Indian government constructed roads through the Uttarakhand hills, up to the northern and eastern borders with Nepal and Tibet. These roads became the veins of the regional economy, facilitating the extraction of labor- ers and resources southwards to the urban plains as well as the importation of plains-manufactured consumer goods northwards into the mountains. By the early 1990s, discontent over this economic imbalance fueled a popular move- ment for regional statehood. It was argued that the state government of Uttar Pradesh had consistently failed to account for the unique environmental, social, and cultural conditions of the Uttarakhand hills and that the smaller government of an Uttarakhand state (eventually realized in November 2000) would facilitate greater inclusion in the fruits of national modernism and development.3 This longstanding pattern of interdependent and exploitative economic rela- tions between the urban plains and the rural hills has been replicated within the music industry. Since the early 1980s, the expressive culture of mountain festivals (music, dance, dress, poetry, etc.) has been exported to recording stu- dios in Delhi, and more recently to the regional state capital of Dehradun, to be codified, edited, packaged, and finally distributed back to the hills in the form of a commodity that ultimately benefits the plains-based company (see map in Figure 1 ). Few hereditary specialists from regional musician-castes (Bajgl, Baddi, Hurkiya, Jagariya) have participated in the regional music industry; the lack of financial resources and social networks in the urban plains, combined with issues of caste-based discrimination, have largely precluded these professional musicians from participating in studio recording. In their place, increasing num- bers of semi-professional singers from higher-caste backgrounds (Rajput and Brahmin) have traveled to Delhi, eager to make a name for themselves and at the same time represent their local communities (cf. Grandin 1989, 188). In order to find financial viability and regional prominence, many have found it necessary to participate in both studio recording and live stage performances. While commercial recordings are rarely profitable (and often incur significant debts on young singers), they generate cultural capital that may eventually lead to invitations to more lucrative live performances. In spite of the geographic and cultural gaps between rural festivals and the urban recording studios, the political and economic context of urban migration, consumer capitalism, and cultural regionalism have created the conditions for significant contact and overlap between these settings. Given this context, it is</page><page sequence="4">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 27 Figure 1. Map of Uttarakhand (courtesy of Natalie Fiol). understandable that studio musicians are utilizing musical forms and styles from village festivals, while festival dancers are incorporating songs and movements created in recording studios. In South Asia, where predominantly rural tradi- tions have co-existed with diversified music industries for decades, such mutual interaction between live and mass-mediated performance is quite common and has been well documented. Ethnomusicologists have long been interested in the stylistic transformations of musical genres such as thumrl , bhajan, rasiya, ghazal , and qawwalt after they have been widely disseminated via studio recordings and films. In some cases, the commodified styles of these genres have transformed the way they are subsequently performed in live presentational settings (Manuel 1986, 1993, 1994; Qureshi 1999). Scott Marcus (1993) and Gregory Booth (1993) have explored this issue from the other direction (bottom-up) by demonstrat- ing the ways in which musical ensembles resignify film songs and commercial devotional songs to suit local contexts of performance. On a transnational stage, Timothy Taylor (2001), Steven Feld (1996, 2000), and Thomas Turino (2000) have each examined unanticipated confrontations resulting from musical bor- rowings (or appropriations, to use a more politically charged term) between multinational companies, pop stars, and indigenous communities.</page><page sequence="5">28 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 20 1 1 While building on these studies, this article focuses on a more regionally contained set of interactive processes. Instead of locally produced music mov- ing outwards to global/transnational mediascapes, or commercial albums moving inwards to local performance contexts,4 Uttarakhandi musicians and sound commodities circulate between studios and festivals, conjoining these two performance settings within a regionally integrated migrant economy. Al- though there may be little agreement about what this type of cultural interaction means, or how it should proceed, few would refute that studio production and festival performance mutually shape the corpus of music and dance within any Uttarakhandi community. Musical feedback across these settings is facilitated by relatively closed loops of consumers/listeners and producers/performers who communicate through the vernacular languages of Garhwali, Kumaoni, and Jaunsari.5 While Hindi film songs, transnational pop, and other Indian regional musical styles have influenced the development of Uttarakhandi git (see below), the relatively circumscribed consumer base- consisting of approximately nine million inhabitants - results in a certain degree of stylistic insularity and feed- back across these performance locations. If my focus is on horizontal rather than vertical relations between these per- formance contexts, this does not mean that issues of power are non-existent or irrelevant. Ones access to, and control over, technology obviously mediates the degree of participation in this process. As mentioned above, musical specialists from lower-caste communities are integral to musical performance in regional festivals, but they have mostly been absent from studio recording contexts. Similarly, female participation in festival dance-songs has always outnumbered male participation in my experience, and there are numerous varieties of dance- songs exclusively performed by women. In the male-dominated space of the recording studio, however, female participation is limited to subsidiary vocal roles performed by about a dozen professional singers, most of who are either unmarried or are married to studio producers or music directors. In village contexts, moreover, hereditary specialists and women tend to have less access to playback technology than high-caste males; as a result, it is somewhat less common (though certainly not rare) for them to integrate commercial songs into communal dance performances. An ethnographic focus on musical and social interaction across festival and studio environments also uncovers more subtle issues of power having to do with the imagination of the urban plains and the mountain village. The conten- tious history of post-colonial capitalism, migrancy, and cultural regionalism has polarized the respective association of the plains and mountains with "moder- nity" and "tradition." Urban studios and village festivals are likewise imagined as oppositional spaces of popular music production and traditional/folk music production. A focus on interactions between these performance contexts can</page><page sequence="6">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 29 reveal how individuals selectively draw upon this bifurcated discourse to ra- tionalize stylistic choices in one setting that, intentionally or unintentionally, inform the other setting. For example, many recording artists choose to include songs from their village locality on commercial albums because of a general perception that these songs are old, autochthonous, traditional, and slowly dis- appearing. Adapting these songs to the conventions of studio recording may be motivated by a desire to revive this repertoire in the village and simultaneously to elevate their own local and regional status. These albums may be listened to and reinterpreted by villagers because they are considered locally relevant, but at the same time, having been produced in urban studios, they are valued for their novelty and sophistication. In the musical texts and the ways that people engage with them, the values for modernity and tradition thus overlap and intersect (Rudolph and Rudolph 1967). This article brings areas of musical life that are normally treated as disparate into one analytical framework so as to demonstrate how they articulate and regenerate one another. At the risk of reifying "the rural festival" and "the urban recording studio," I privilege each of these settings in turn, highlighting a num- ber of redundant features that lend coherence to musical performances. The goal is not to comprehensively account for stylistic constancy and change in each of these settings but rather to demonstrate how conventional patterns of behavior, sound, and meaning within one performance context may facilitate or impede musical adaptation within the other context. A number of critical questions will be examined: How does an awareness of the regularized recording of the dance-song repertoire in the studio transform the way that villagers experience and reinterpret this music? Conversely, how does the habituated integration of commercial recordings into festival dance- song repertoires transform the way that studio participants understand their task and make musical choices? Finally, how and why do certain musical elements translate from the studio context to the festival context, or vice versa, while others do not? Incorporating Uttarakhandi Git into Festival Dance-Songs In Uttarakhand, as in agrarian societies across South Asia, festivals are opportu- nities to celebrate profane and sacred relationships and to mark auspicious times and places. Festivals in Uttarakhand are known by a variety of different names that offer clues to their varied social functions: "sacred geography ( thaul ), lust or curiosity for spectacle ( kauthik ), longing for togetherness (me/a), religious urge for communion with the divine, and innate responses to the changing rhythms of nature ( ausar )" (Purohit 2001, 365). The variety of musical perfor- mance on display across this spectrum of occasions is likewise extremely diverse and may include: hill bands (consisting of bagpipe and dhol-damaun);6 brass</page><page sequence="7">30 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 20 1 1 bands (modeled on plains-based ensembles); solo ballad singing ( panwara ); unaccompanied devotional chanting; processional music on drums and natural trumpets ( karndl , bhankora, ransingha ); ritual dances performed by musician- caste specialists (Dakki, Bajgi, Baddi); staged dances and songs performed by commercial artists and folkloric dance troupes; and most commonly, participa- tory round dance-songs. With the growth of the regional music industry since the 1980s, cassette play- back, amplified through loudspeakers, has also become an increasingly com- mon sonic feature of festival environments.7 While this is to be expected in large-scale, urban melds that incorporate competition and stage performances,8 it has also become part of the sonic environment of interior festivals. Several music producers describe rural festivals as an important testing ground for new albums. Even though a larger percentage of Uttarakhandi gzf consumers reside in urban centers in the plains, some producers attempt to gauge the positive or negative reception of an album among highland audiences first because they claim this provides an accurate indication of how the album will sell elsewhere. Music companies often release albums several weeks prior to a major festival, especially if the album has songs honoring the local deity or the festival in ques- tion. Cassette shops along the major roadways in the foothill urban centers of Vikasnagar, Dehradun, Rishikesh, Kotdwar, Haldwani, and Kathgodam stock the latest albums and sell to tourists, pilgrims, and vendors traveling to mountain festivals. Less-experienced musicians who have self-produced albums may also sell or give these away at festivals as a form of advertising; if the album is well received, it can lead to private bookings or live performances at other festivals. Even when cassette playback is desirable during a festival, it is often not pos- sible because of intermittent or nonexistent electrical current and the remoteness of many festival locations. In such contexts, the influence of commercial music is indirectly evident in the performances of round dance-songs, by far the most ubiquitous and participatory form of festival music making. There are many terms for round dance-songs across this region- tandi, harul , laman , chopati are common in Jaunsar and western Garhwal; jhumeilo, thadya , and caunfla are common in eastern Garhwal; cdnceri and thoda are common in Kumaon- yet all of these involve dancers in circular formations stepping together while sing- ing call-and-response, antiphonal, or unison verses. While some of the local terms for dance-songs correspond to specific rhythmic and footwork patterns, the styles of rendering these dance-songs may vary significantly even between two neighboring villages that use the same terminology. As festivals are meeting places for members of many different communities, dance-song performances are a means for people from one locality to set themselves apart from others, just as they also facilitate experimentation and borrowing across communi- ties (Hatwal 2009). The repertoire of dance-songs performed within a single</page><page sequence="8">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 31 village is often very large, encompassing a variety of styles and social functions (e.g., courting, demonstrating gender solidarity or complimentarily, exhibit- ing martial prowess, narrating local histories, highlighting seasonal changes, worshipping local deities, etc.). Many of these dance-song styles are rarely if ever performed today, while others have been disseminated on cassette, VCD, radio, and television, encouraging the participation of young people in festival performances. In March 2005, 1 accompanied friends to the popular Naugaon mela , which had attracted more than two thousand people from Rawain, in the northwest corner of Garhwal, and from the urban plains. Throughout the day and into the night, people gathered in the main village courtyard, singing and dancing in cir- cular formations of anywhere between four to fifty people. Some of the smaller groups danced unaccompanied, but their songs were drowned out by the larger circles, which were accompanied on the dhol performed by Bagji, hereditary drummers from their locality. (Despite the participatory nature of dance-songs, the roles of dancer and drummer tend to be divided by caste background.) Almost every group of dancers exhibited a distinctive footwork pattern and a unique form of linking hands and arms across the waist or shoulders. When dancers became tired of a particular song and the volume of the singing began to dissipate, one, or several, in the group introduced a new song without losing a step, although often times the footwork pattern and rhythmic accompaniment shifted slightly to fit the melodic rhythm of the new song. At times, I became aware that dancers were drawing on commercial record- ings as a source for dance-songs. Young male dancers, amidst much laughter from their peers, directed romantic lyrics toward young women on the other side of the circle while mimicking the stylized movements portrayed on VCD albums. Throughout the day, dancers incorporated songs from a number of different artists, but the songs of Narendra Singh Negi, the most prolific and popular recording artist in Uttarakhand, and Mehinder Chauhan, a young singer from Rawain, were the favorites. Several adolescents admitted to having learned the texts of these dance-songs through repeated exposure to cassettes and VCDs. One individual claimed that he was not so interested in dance-songs until he began listening to Negi s albums, which often include one or two tracks labeled "traditional" ( paramparik ) that are modeled after village dance-songs. In conversations with Narendra Singh Negi and Mehinder Chauhan, it was apparent that they anticipated and welcomed the incorporation of their compo- sitions into festival settings. These musicians clearly measured their success in commercial terms (numbers of albums recorded, amount of fees commanded), but they also identified the purpose of their recording to be one of regenerating interest in "folk music" ( lok sangit). Both musicians have sought out village elders and folklorists to gather material for their recordings. Chauhan has collected and</page><page sequence="9">32 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 2011 recorded a number of texts and melodies of laman from Rawain in an effort to revive this repertoire among the present generation. He claimed that during live performances in Rawain he is requested to sing this traditional repertoire even more than his own compositions. I attended one of his collaborative songwriting sessions and observed him and several poets from the region composing song verses by extracting themes from various local historical narratives. Negis approach was less localized and more pan-regional (as was his fame), but he showed a similar interest in preservationist projects and in maintaining what he called the "folk element" (using the English phrase) in his songs. Which time do we save? [The songs from] seven hundred years ago? What hap- pened to the creations from four hundred years ago? In the fifty years to come, what will be the folksongs? You can call it anything you like: traditional song, new song, modern song. Maybe it's fifty or forty years old, [but after] one hundred years it will become a folk song. It is a circle out of which some songs will fall and become extinct and some others will prevail . . . Now, when my name is not in the songs, so my name will gradually be deleted from these songs, and then the songs will remain. If they have the strength to remain, then they will remain. In this way, folk music ( lok sangit) will be made. In this way, the "folk element" will be important. You have to see whether there's a "folk ele- ment" in this [music] or not! If not, then reject it. If there is, then record it. Because [through these] songs, Garhwali git, Kumaoni git, folk will be made after fifty, sixty, one hundred years. But it will only happen if [people] record and play it. (Narendra Singh Negi, personal interview, April 11, 2005, emphasis added) For Negi, a commercial recording would only become accepted over time as a legitimate folk song if the "folk element" were retained in the recording.9 One pertinent question, which will be considered below, is how Negi goes about iden- tifying and isolating the folk element for his compositions? Another question is whether songs originating in the recording studio could ever be considered folk songs in the same way as localized, anonymously composed, orally trans- mitted, and communally rendered festival songs? This obviously depends upon the degree of sonic and social transformation that can occur when commercial songs are adapted to festival settings. Certain musical transformations are more immediate, and stem from the structural differences between music-making in the studio and in the festival. For example, studio-produced Uttarakhandi git are soloist driven, verse-refrain structured, and three to five minutes in length, and the temporally fragmented, multi-track production process is oriented toward the end product. When adapted to festival settings, which emphasize participa- tory dancing, dhol-driven accompaniment, and open-ended songs consisting of one or two repeated melodic phrases, Uttarakhandi git will necessarily be altered in terms of tempo, texture, melodic structure, instrumentation, and overall form.</page><page sequence="10">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 33 The fundamental transformation of the identity of a song, however, will result not from these superficial stylistic alterations but from a more gradual process of communal identification and adaptation. Narendra Singh Negi, for example, described a festival performance in which he was unable to recognize his own compositions because of what he termed a continuous process of "filtering." Negi: I've seen villagers in Jaunsar [western Garhwal] . . . singing a song [while dancing]. But I couldn't recognize the songs, and I couldn't even understand the words. Afterwards they told me, "Negiji, this is your song." Fiol: So, in their own way, they changed your song? Negi: Exactly. This is what's so special. There is a "filter" at work, and for this reason songs last for one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, years. Today, the songs that we call canceri , you cannot know how these were written two hundred years back. The original song was something else. But over time, the "filter" was working, and changes in the melody were introduced so that people would enjoy it more, and certain words would be linked to other words so that it would reflect their life. So this filtering over time is what has allowed the songs to come in the form that we have them, and they may be two hundred or three hundred years old. Today these [songs] are perfect; there is no need to change them. People cut them and reformed them so much and have revealed these forms to us today. This is how much filtering has happened. (N. Negi, personal interview, April 11, 2005) Negi s metaphor of a communal filter that strains the content of commercial songs over time, subtracting irrelevant features and adding locally meaningful ones, is a provocative (if somewhat romanticized) way of describing the trans- formation of commercial recordings into village dance-songs. In my experience, the village dancers who incorporated Negis songs remained conscious of the fact that they were singing his songs (even if Negi would not have been able to recognize them as his own), and not autochthonous village songs. Neverthe- less, Negi has good reason to believe that with the passage of time some of his compositions may enter the folksong repertoire (if by folksong one accepts the conventional interpretation of an orally disseminated and communally owned song of unknown provenance). In the mid-twentieth century, Brij Mohan Shah and Mohan Upreti, two lead- ing ambassadors of Kumaoni music, theater, and dance, composed the song "Beru Pako." It was first performed by Upretis Delhi-based theater company Parvatiya Kala Kendra at a stage program in 1952, and Upreti also recorded the song for the HMV label. (Legend has it that after a folk festival, Prime Minister Nehru selected this song as his favorite and distributed the LP album to other dignitaries.) By the 1980s, "Beru Pako" had become the folk anthem of Utta- rakhand, and even today it is a ubiquitous part of the repertoire of weddings, processions, and festivals. The songs notoriety must be attributed at least in</page><page sequence="11">34 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 201 1 part to its commercial diffusion beginning with the LP album and followed by numerous cassette and VCD remixes, mobile phone ringtones, and a national Coca-Cola advertisement.10 Few of the village musicians I worked with knew how old this song was nor who had composed it. One Kumoani music producer I spoke with lamented the fact that this relatively modern song was erroneously categorized by many people as a folk song, and Upreti, a composer-poet working to professionalize Kumaoni art forms, was erroneously labeled a folk artist. In his opinion, "a whole generation of people is looking to capitalize on the name of folk when they are, in fact, burying it" (personal communication, Prabhat Gangola Shah, August 7, 2005). While there are differing viewpoints regarding the merits of commercializa- tion, this example bolsters Negi s claim that some commercial songs are gradu- ally filtering into the village repertoire. Yet it also qualifies Negi s claim, because this filtering process is not simply the unmediated response of villagers adapting these commercial songs to traditional settings. The widespread incorporation of "Beru Pako" into rural performances has been contingent upon its dissemina- tion and consumption through a wide array of commercial media. Rather than imagining a shift from a commercial sphere of production into a traditional sphere of consumption, it is necessary to consider how village engagements with mass-mediated music have become part of the process of constructing the category of folksongs. As in the British and American folksong "revivals," the music industry has played a pivotal role in valorizing the concept of the folksong ( lokgxt ) as a primordial and communal voice of the people and has become a primary means of locating and disseminating a corpus of folk music. One further example may elucidate the impact of commercial mass-mediated music on village-based festival performance. In April 2005 I attended the on- site shooting of singer Mehinder Chauhans video album Minu Ai in Rawain. A production team of around fifteen individuals performing various roles - drivers, make-up artists, soundmen, lighting assistants, actors, dancers, cam- eramen, utility men, producer, director, and assistant director- assembled at Chauhans village home after a seven-hour drive up the Yamuna river valley from Dehradun. Most of the crewmembers were originally from Uttarakhand, but none was from the Rawain area. It took approximately a week for the production team to record the mate- rial that would later be edited into a video album of eight songs. At around ten o'clock on the first night, the crew set up in front of the temple court- yard in Chauhans village to record the title track, "Minu Ai." Chauhan had composed the songs text on the theme of the beauty of a village girl, and he set this to a tune common to many regional tandi - the generic name for round dance-songs. The filming did not coincide with any local festival, but the occasion nevertheless created something close to a festival atmosphere.</page><page sequence="12">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 35 Many high-caste women and men from this village and several nearby vil- lages donned their best clothes and assembled in the courtyard. It took several hours for the director to rein in the enthusiasm of the dancers and get them to synchronize their movements with the barely audible playback of the cassette recording (released several weeks earlier) through a small tape player (Figure 2). The tempo of the studio recording was unnaturally slow for the dancers, and many found it difficult to move together. To improve this, they would begin singing alongside Chauhan's recorded voice but would then be unable to hear the recorded playback and would gradually increase the tempo, to the director's consternation. The next night, in an effort to find better material for the title track, the direc- tor accepted the invitation of the headman of another nearby village, who no doubt wanted to memorialize his village by virtue of a VCD production appear- ance. Chauhan had a difficult time teaching the dhol drummers to only mime the action of drumming without actually striking the drum because this once again drowned out the cassette playback, making it difficult for the dancers to follow the correct tempo. Meanwhile, I asked several elderly women seated in the courtyard if they were excited to have their village represented on the com- mercial VCD. To my surprise, one woman replied that a number of video albums had previously been filmed in this village, and that it was in fact becoming a Figure 2. On-site shooting of the VCD Mtnu Ai.</page><page sequence="13">36 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 20 1 1 nuisance, because these production teams demanded a lot and never gave any- thing back. Part of her resentment was triggered by the manner in which this production team interacted with the villagers. Arriving late at night, they set up a noisy generator to power their spotlights, enlisted the help of the village headman to bring the entire village out of bed and to the courtyard, and then advised many women to clean up and change clothes because they were deemed unsuitable to appear in the scene. In contrast to the previous night, there was little enthusiasm on this occasion; the director frequently cued the spectators and dancers to clap and cheer, which often produced little or no response.11 This VCD shoot is a rather atypical example of the cyclical feedback between the studio and the festival, contexts that are normally separated geographically and temporally. Here, in contrast, the contingencies of these two contexts con- verged within one localized performance space, exposing areas of synthesis and compromise. Chauhans already-released audio recording employed the con- ventional rhythms and melodies of tandi dance- songs, prompting the creation of a festival scene for the VCD album in the first place. Yet his recording also introduced a slower than normal tempo and a new text, and the dancers in the recording were required to learn and adapt to these elements while reconstruct- ing a festival experience. For many participants from the second village, this was a completely manufactured experience of "tradition" by the video production team. Yet for many of the dancers in Chauhan's village, the video shoot was treated as a truly auspicious occasion; it was an opportunity to demonstrate the unity of the village and to share the success of one of their own kin. Mass- mediated and festival-based music thus interacted at many levels and prompted a range of positive and negative interpretations. My objective thus far has been to assess the impact of the commercializa- tion of round dance-songs on their performance and conceptualization in rural festivals. I may be guilty of overstating the influence of commercial recordings on festival contexts, and there is a vast corpus of festival music and dance that, for whatever reason, has yet to be commercially recorded. Yet it was only after repeatedly returning to several villages in Rawain and participating in their local festivals over the course of two years that I began to consider the broader ef- fects of the music industry on festival performance. One evening, while viewing one of my video recordings of a recent festival performance on the television of the village headman ( padhan), 12 several male viewers began arguing about the authenticity of one of the dance-song texts. The particular song under discus- sion was a variety of harul , a slower-paced dance-song genre often performed by Rajput men and associated with historical narratives of valor. One elder man felt that an important section of this song's narrative was left out while his middle- aged son-in-law disagreed, claiming that this was the way he had learned the song. As part of his defense, the latter admitted that this was also the version</page><page sequence="14">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 37 presented on Mehinder Chauhans cassette album, Dandi Kureri. This remark drew scorn from the elder man, and several others present, who argued that "kaset music," essentially a modern phenomenon, could not be regarded as an authority on traditional matters. While this point essentially ended the debate, it was nevertheless striking that Chauhans recording had entered this conversation at all. As recording artists are seeking to authenticate their songs by drawing on festival practices, some village performers have turned to commercial recordings as a source for learning and legitimating the music performed in "traditional" festival contexts. Making Uttarakhandi Git "Traditional" in the Urban Recording Studio If the previous section focused on the effects of recordings of round dance-songs on festival performance practice, this section is concerned with the reverse re- lationship. How does the regular incorporation of recorded songs into festival performances alter the way that producers, music directors, and singers make musical choices in the recording studio? Before considering this question, it is necessary to historically contextualize the use of "folk elements" within Utta- rakhandi git recordings. Radio was the first electronic mass medium to have a major impact on mountain-dwelling populations.13 Beginning in the 1950s, live studio performances featuring regional musicians were broadcast on the state- owned All India Radio (AIR) stations in Delhi and Lucknow (and from 1978 in Nejibabad, northern Uttar Pradesh). AIR staff also went on field expeditions to mountain villages to record a wide range of hereditary musical specialists. By the 1990s, government-run media were losing ground to the private sector, and these field expeditions were deemed too expensive; henceforth, musicians were required to travel to AIR studios in the urban plains to make recordings. One consequence of this policy shift was that hereditary musicians from lower caste and lower-class backgrounds had fewer opportunities to participate in the music industry. Beginning in the late 1970s, amateur or semi-professional musi- cians living in the urban plains established informal social networks and reg- istered cultural organizations. Musicians from Akhil Garhwal Sabha, Kumaon Sabha, and the aforementioned Parvatiya Kala Kendra, for example, began to seek opportunities within the Delhi-based music industry at the same time that private music companies emerged to capitalize on the potential for regional music markets (see Manuel 1993, chapter 8). By the mid-1980s, private music companies such as Saraswati, Neelam, and Rama began specializing in vernacu- lar language recordings and soon became brand names for Uttarakhandi git aficionados. During this period, the only individuals in the recording studio from Uttarakhand were the lead singers; producers, music directors, engineers,</page><page sequence="15">38 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 20 1 1 and session musicians had little to no knowledge of the language or music of Uttarakhand. As a result, music directors resorted to generic folk arrangements, incorporating stylistic features from the better-known and larger Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Punjabi regional industries or from light-classical ghazal and bhajan genres, accompanied on flute, harmonium, dholak , and tabla. By the 1990s, Uttarakhandi migrants, particularly from Garhwal, had estab- lished themselves in the Delhi-based music industry as accompanists, music directors, and, in rare cases, producers. Albums from this period featured an expanded range of cosmopolitan instruments (guitar, mandolin, drum pads, and synthesizers), indigenous instruments such as hudka (an hourglass-shaped pres- sure drum) and binai (Jews harp), non-indigenous instruments that were nev- ertheless evocative of Himalayan landscapes such as bansuri (bamboo flute) and santur (hammered dulcimer), and standard percussion instruments used across North India ( dholak and tabla). The texts of Uttarakhandi git treated sentiments familiar to both the villager and the male migrant: the married woman pining for her natal village and family, the beauty of the hills during different seasons, and the separation from ones kin and one's beloved. While all albums were ge- nerically labeled Uttarakhandi git (or, more specifically, Jaunsari git , Garhwali git, and Kumaoni git), the musical arrangements on the albums revealed one of two distinct stylistic approaches: an "unadorned" style rooted in indigenous musical forms and texts, and performed by a small number of hereditary vil- lage musicians; or a "commercial" style assimilating characteristics of Hindi film music and other regional commercial styles, and performed by high-caste urban migrants (Alter 1998). 14 On commercial recordings since the late 1990s, there is evidence that these two distinct styles of presenting Uttarakhandi git are merging. Migrant musicians continue to be interested in "modernizing" the sound of Uttarakhandi git , but they are also interested in drawing upon specialist genres (e.g., jagar, panwara, Baddi git) and round dance-songs. The latter, commonly labeled "folksongs" (lokgit) or "traditional songs" (paramparik git) on the album covers, appear on the recent albums of each of Uttarakhand's most commercially successful singers (Narendra Singh Negi, Pritam Bhartwan, Gajender Rana, Manglesh Dangwal, Hira Singh Rana, etc.). The remainder of the tracks on these albums consists of "original" compositions (although the originality of these songs can be debated as they are often based upon recombinations of village-based rhythms, melodies, and texts). The impetus for singers and music companies to combine different styles of presentation on the same album may in part be found in the expansion of con- sumer markets, in both the Uttarakhand hills and the urban plains, connected by a bourgeoning migrant economy. An even more important factor for the mixed song selection may be the heightened social and physical mobility of migrant</page><page sequence="16">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 39 singers. As migrant singers move frequently between village festivals and re- cording studios, interacting across varied social networks, they become cultural intermediaries who necessarily mediate between rural and urban perspectives. Like the "stars" of major international music industries, successful recording artists in Uttarakhand demonstrate their cosmopolitanism through mobile practices. Unlike many musical celebrities elsewhere, however, Uttarakhandi musicians remain closely connected to village communities through affine and kin relations, and they return to the village frequently during festival seasons. The mobile lifestyle of the recording artist produces what could be called an experience of "double nostalgia": while in the city, the migrant singer longs for the simplicity and purity of village life, and while in the village, he longs for the sophistication of plains-based modernity. Each of these experiences of nostalgia manifests in the musical styles and lyrics of Uttarakhandi git, which serve as virtual "memory banks" for real and imagined experiences of the city and the village (Greene 2003, 48). Because of the migrant singer s position of "in-between-ness," there have been paradoxical tendencies to standardize and vernacularize the musical ar- rangements of Uttarakhandi git Standardization has been evident in the use of external sonic elements, such as the use of dense textures and electronic sound effects associated with Hindi film soundtracks. Narendra Singh Negi defended the practice as follows: The atmosphere of the city and the village are different. No? And when the child watches Hindi films and English films, listens to Hindi songs, and your Hollywood and Bollywood ... so he also wants that this type of thing be made in Garhwali. So be it. And we try to give it to them . . . what I'm writing and composing that is new, I'm trying to keep this theme in mind. To give the new generation something in the beat, [something] that gets them interested. So that they say, "this will be good to dance to." (N. Negi, personal interview, April 11, 2005) Standardization within Uttarakhandi git has also resulted from a conscious synthesis of texts and musical styles from different parts of Uttarakhand. Narendra Singh Negi s songs are predominantly written in the Salan dialect of Garhwali associated with his home district of Pauri; yet Negi regularly borrows rhythms, melodies, and vernacular phrases from different sub-regions, a prac- tice that also has also parallels in Nepali lokgit (Greene 2003; Henderson 2002). Negi s skill as a songwriter has been attributed to his ability to evoke localized cultural sentiments (vernacularization) while also maintaining a level of acces- sibility and intelligibility among nearly all Uttarakhandis (standardization).15 The dual processes of vernacularization and standardization are also evident in the ever-expanding VCD industry. As evidenced in the above example of Chauhans Minu Ai album, plains-based production teams and dance troupes</page><page sequence="17">40 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 20 1 1 regularly attend mountain festivals or recreate festival-like settings for video shoots. Yet many mountain towns and villages can now boast their own teams of singers, instrumentalists, dancers, videographers, and producers who travel to the plains long enough to rent a recording studio and get copies made of a master album. With little or no input from plains-based music directors, these albums exhibit mostly localized content with selective influences from main- stream popular music. For example, Hao Jao Bdbd Naukari (2001), one of the first VCDs released in Uttarakhand, was a small-scale community production recorded almost entirely in a Jaunsari village courtyard on a personal camcorder. The album sold extremely well in nearby towns and villages because of the per- sonal connection that these viewers felt toward the community and the round dance-songs styles represented on the album. Surprisingly, the album also sold well in other parts of Garhwal and in the migrant communities around Delhi. One producer attributed this success to the albums evocation of an authentic "folk style" and to the dancers' use of colorful costumes and choreographed routines, inspired by Bollywood song and dance routines. Achieving a balance between standardization and vernacularization and marketing to both local audiences and pan-regional audiences was an explicit goal for a number of regional music producers I met in Delhi. Many were will- ing to fund albums dedicated to a particular deity, festival occasion, or dance- song style if they could be confident of a concentrated (if still temporally and geographically limited) market for their investment. Even on these localized albums, however, producers replicated standardized features of Uttarakhandi git (e.g., verse-refrain form with instrumental interludes, bansuri and dholak-tabla tracks, pentatonic melodies, and nasal vocal timbres) because, according to one studio producer, "if you [attempt to] experiment, the old people [in the villages] have the mindset that this is not Uttarakhandi git" (personal communication, Rajiv Masi, February 7, 2005). The positive reception of cassette and VCD albums in village communities, and their integration into festival dance-song repertories, has also influenced the way that producers and music directors construct Uttarakhandi git. Many refrains are antiphonally structured, with gendered choirs alternating between an antecedent phrase and text (generally posed in the form of a question) answered by a consequent phrase and text (e.g., Chauhans title track on Minu Ai). This practice mirrors the antiphonal, gendered performance style of many dance- songs in which women and men sing independently while moving in concentric circles. Other sonic features employed on studio albums are even more obvious icons of festival contexts, such as audio sampling of ringing temple bells, piercing cadences of the ransingha (the S-shaped trumpet played in procession or in the presence of deities), and collective exclamations of dancers (e.g., "sobase, sobase").</page><page sequence="18">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 41 A number of studio performers I spoke with attributed the marked emphasis on percussion in recordings of the last decade- in terms of both an increased number of rhythm tracks and the relative intensity of these tracks within the overall mix - to the use of Uttarakhandi git as the basis for live-dance perfor- mances. The expectation that recordings will be used for dance performance can also alter decisions about tempo. One in-studio discussion about the correct tempo of a song was resolved only after the lead singer argued that his composi- tion was based upon a cauhfla dance-song and thus needed to be recorded in a moderately fast tempo so that dancers in his village would find it easier to follow in their performances. Since the early 1990s, when Uttarakhandi percussionists began to accompany regional albums in Delhi studios, they have developed a corpus of rhythmic pat- terns coded by sub-region. For example, the chalan (lit. "movement," but here referring to the internal rhythmic articulation) of kemta tala and kaherva tala (cycles of six and eight beats, respectively) will be rendered differently by studio percussionists depending on whether the song and/or lead studio singer come from Jaunsar, Kumaon, or various parts of Garhwal.16 Although these rhythmic patterns are usually performed on dholak-tabla in the studio, as opposed to dhol-damaun , they are nevertheless indices of dance-song performance, and their inclusion may thereby facilitate a recording s incorporation into the festival dance context. From a longue duree perspective of the regional music industry, the appropriation of village-based rhythmic patterns is an example of vernacu- larization and demonstrates the influence that regional dance-songs styles have had on Uttarakhandi git From the perspective of village practice, however, these rhythmic patterns represent only a small fraction of those in general use, and their repeated use in studio recordings has contributed to the gradual standard- ization of village drumming practices. From the Festival to the Studio and Back Again: Nanda Devi Raj Jat The story of one of Narendra Singh Negis most successful albums offers a final example of the circular interaction between studio and festival performance that is the focus of this article. Nanda Devi is the most widely worshipped form of the goddess in Uttarakhand; she is more commonly known as Parvati, the wife of Lord Shiva, but is also locally known by many other titles such as Gaura, Uma, Bhagwati, Chandravati, and Raja Rajeshwari. Each winter, Nanda Devi is processed on a palanquin ( dholi ) during the "small pilgrimage" ( chota jat). The raj jat, or "royal pilgrimage," occurs approximately every twelve years and involves a much longer journey from Nanda s high mountain abode, where she lives with her husband, Lord Shiva, to a number of villages, each of which regards</page><page sequence="19">42 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 201 1 the goddess as its own out-married daughter ( dhyanl ). In a particularly famous instance of the anthropomorphism that characterizes the popular Hinduism of the central Himalayas, Nandas journey from her affinal home ( sasural ) to her natal home ( mait ) mirrors the journey that married women make generally once a year. The arrival of the goddess is thus particularly significant for all of the out-married women who return home and perform dance-songs about their experiences of joyfully reuniting with and painfully separating from the goddess and their village kin (Sax 1991). Many of the round dance-songs honoring Nanda Devi are no longer per- formed by village women. One of the ways that I heard locals account for this loss was to argue that commercially recorded music had inundated the village and had obviated the need for live performance during the festival. (Uttarakhandigzf is doubly cast as the villain and the savior in this story.) A prominent folklorist, playwright, and close collaborator of mine, Datta Ram Purohit, had participated in several of the pilgrimages for Nanda Devi, and, noting the decay of this rep- ertoire, he decided to stage an open-air recording session in 1991 with some of the old women who still remembered these dance-songs. The transcription in Figure 3 is taken from an excerpt of one of the items on this field recording, which had neither titles nor clear beginnings or end- ings. The text expresses the female devotees' desire for Chandravati (another name for Nanda Devi) to dance ( nac ) in the village courtyard ( candan ki cauki). They asked why the Goddess was angry ( ruthu ) and tried to appease her by reminiscing about the different jewelry she received on her wedding day: earrings ( kan kundal ), nose hoops ( nak nathuli ), and ankle bells {ghunri ghungur). After the lead singer introduced each line of text, the group repeated it three times before a new line was introduced. While singing, the group interlinked their arms and moved in a dance pattern called caunfla: three steps to the right and one step to the left. After four repetitions of this pattern (corresponding with two statements of the melody), the dancers reversed direction, inverting the basic pattern - three steps to the left and one step to the right - for four more repetitions before reverting back, and so on. One of the idiosyncrasies of this NSic NSc Chandr3va-ti chandana-ki chau-ki chau Figure 3. Lata Village performance.</page><page sequence="20">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 43 dance is the rhythmic anticipation of the change in rotational direction. On the fourth repetition of the pattern, the final step to the right (or left) becomes the first step to the left (or right) in the new pattern; this is represented by the two missing beats in the second ending of the transcription. The most recent royal pilgrimage of Nanda Devi, in 2000, received an un- precedented amount of national publicity, in part because it coincided with the formation of the new regional state of Uttarakhand in North India, and it was hard to imagine a better sign of regional unity and spirituality than Nanda Devi. Narendra Singh Negi saw commercial potential in an album of songs dedicated to the goddess, and he used the aforementioned field recordings as the basis for a two-cassette album.17 Working together with musical accompanists and music directors at the T-Series studios in Delhi, he produced an arrangement scored for a female choir and flute, hammered dulcimer, keyboard, tabla , dholak, and hudka. Besides the added instrumentation, Negi's adaptation of "Nac Nac Chandravati" (Figure 4) differed from the field recording in terms of its bounded length, slower tempo, and regularized 8-beat rhythmic pattern. The melodic rhythm was squared off in this version, and the melodic movement was simpli- fied, repeating a nearly identical ascending and descending phrase and returning to the tonic at the initial beat of each measure. Negi added an additional pitch to the melody (B-flat, or komal nishad), creating modal affinity with raga dhuni, which is commonly used throughout the region.18 He also presents the text in verse-refrain form, despite maintaining a singular melodic phrase throughout the song. Each line of text repeats only once, returning to the refrain, which is also repeated once. Negi justified many of these changes as an effort to minimize the redundancy of the field recording. Other changes were not intentional, but they may be un- derstood to result from conventional patterns of technological mediation and the collaboration of many people in the recording studio, many of whom have had little exposure to festival dance-songs. Despite these transformations, Negi was committed to retaining what he identified as the "folk elements" of the field 0 = 120 I NSc NS.C ChandrSva-ti chandanM-ki chau-ki Figure 4. Narendra Singh Negi s commercial recording of "Nac Nac Chandravati."</page><page sequence="21">44 Asian Music : Winter/Spring 201 1 recording, and he claimed that these essential aspects were only clarified by the commercial recording: The thing [we have produced] is ultimately the same [as the field recordings] . But I gave [the singers] something new in the throat; I made it a little musically rich, no? And the tunes [dhun] I used are also from these [old songs] . But the way these things were dying out, we realized this as we were in the process . . . Why did people stop listening [to these songs]? One reason was that the words weren't coming clearly. What was being sung? It was not always clear what words were being spoken in the recordings, because these were old ladies. So the words are coming clearer [in our recording] , but the tunes are the same, the themes are the same, it deals with Nanda Devi, and the storyline is the same. Everything is the same. (N. Negi, personal interview, April 11, 2005) The Nanda Devi Raj Jat cassette album reportedly sold over three hundred thousand copies within a few weeks of its release, making it one of the best- selling albums in the history of the regional music industry. Vikram Rawat, Negi s manager and producer, explained that the key to the success of the album was that "it went [to the] plains, and the media covered it so much- it found so much promotion- that all over Garhwal and Kumaon it was famous at that time. So much so that the inlay card of our cassette was placed on the plate [used for devotional offerings during Hindu rituals] ( puja ke thana )" (personal communication, July 15, 2005). The recorded playback of these songs was a ubiquitous component of the pil- grimage, and festival dancers adapted the texts and tunes into their participatory dances. Interestingly, many dancers were unaware that they were reinterpreting a much older stratum of village dance-songs, instead believing that these were Negis original compositions in honor of the goddess. Following the success of the cassette album, T-Series produced a video album (see Figure 5) that su- perimposed footage of pilgrimage scenes and festival dancing over the studio soundtrack. This album quickly became the best-selling VCD on the market, and many industry insiders credit its success for the explosion in VCD production at the beginning of the decade. Several regional companies attempted to piggyback on the success of the T-Series production, producing audio and video albums of the raj jat that combined live footage with studio-produced aspects.19 The success of this album can be explained in part by Negi's retention of the underlying rhythm and cadence of the songs from the field recording, which facilitated their incorporation into communal caunfla dances. The collective, embodied movement of the caunfla dance was a stable feature through which a range of old and new texts and tunes was continuously recycled. Moving to- gether with arms interlinked, these female participants adapted Negi s tunes and texts to their movements, re-establishing them as an important component of devotional practice during this festival. Only time will tell whether any of these songs lose their identity as Uttarakhandi git and gradually become "filtered" into the communal folksong repertoire.</page><page sequence="22">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 45 Figure 5. Narendra Singh Negis VCD album, Jai Ma Nanda Devi (2000). Concluding Thoughts This article has explored musical feedback between live and mass-mediated con- texts of dance-song performance, as sound commodities and semi-professional migrant musicians oscillate between rural festivals and urban recording studios. The underlying social processes that facilitate this feedback in Uttarakhand cor- respond with a wide range of cases documented elsewhere (e.g., Fenster 1995, Grandin 1989; Keil 1984; Meintjes 2003; Mukuna 1992; Rasmussen 1995; Rosenburg 1993; Scales 2002; Silverman 2007; Venkataraman 1994). Each of these studies highlights a context in which private or state- run music indus- tries have expanded and diversified to produce recorded music for specific sub- national regions or ethnic, racial, linguistic, or religious minority communities. In most cases, this process was precipitated by the growth of an urban migrant class. As an increasing number of migrants from distinct cultural groups began to participate in the urban music industry, it became easier and more important for them to distinguish the style of their cultural group from that of other groups (in the case of Uttarakhand, this desire was coordinated with a political region - alist movement in the early 1990s). As a result, studio musicians adapted and standardized many aspects of village musical life and combined these aspects with mainstream studio techniques. Migrant performers became the cultural in- termediaries in this process, translating village codes into a cosmopolitan idiom and facilitating the incorporation of this idiom into the cultural life of the village.</page><page sequence="23">46 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 20 1 1 At the same time, contemporary festivals in many parts of the world have un- dergone processes of commercialization and folklorization (Dudley 2002; Borah 2005; Widdess 1994); the Nanda Devi pilgrimage is an example of the conver- gence of local, state, and regional commercial interests that has become common elsewhere. Moreover, with the availability of inexpensive playback technology in the latter decades of the twentieth century, vernacular-language recordings have been disseminated beyond urban migrant communities to rural populations via radio, cassette, and television stations, and more recently, VCDs.20 In the case of Uttarakhand, it is difficult to determine the extent of the festival/ studio interactions described in this article, but it is safe to say that only a small portion of all Uttarakhandi git ends up being performed in festivals and that the majority of festival dance-songs never find their way onto commercial record- ings. One reason for this is the geographic distance between these settings, but an even more important reason may be the unique socio-musical features of each performance environment. The experience of performing dance-songs in festival settings is shaped by the relatively circumscribed roles of drummer and singer-dancer; by the circular stepping pattern of the dance; by the introduction of melodic phrases and texts that are known to and supported by the majority of participants; by the gendered arrangement of song and dance patterns; and by the broader socio-religious meaning of the festival occasion. The experience of recording dance-songs in studio settings, in contrast, is mediated by the circum- scribed and somewhat hierarchical roles of producer, music director, engineer, session musician, and migrant singer; by the relationships to technology and to the end-product; by the fragmented process of multi-track recording; by the conventions of verse-refrain form; by the bounded length of songs and albums; and by the broad range of electronic and acoustic instrumentation available. Because of these contextual differences, songs that do migrate from one setting to the other are rarely transferred intact; rather, as the example from Nanda Devi Raj Jat demonstrated, it is more common that particular timbres and textures, or fragments of tunes, rhythms, and texts, are reassembled in and adapted to the new performance environment. One obvious point to take from this is that musical performance evolves unevenly and unpredictably across many arenas of social life; it is made up of many streams of influence, making it difficult if not impossible to determine a starting or ending point in the creative process. While it is commonly assumed that commercial studio recording encourages musical standardization and vil- lage festivals encourage musical vernacularization, it is more accurate to say that both of these processes are unfolding dialectically as songs are continuously refashioned across these contexts. Uttarakhandi git have helped to codify a rep- ertoire of regional folk songs (e.g., "Beru Pako")&gt; but they have also stimulated localized interpretations of melodies and movements in festivals. Similarly, the increasing number of Uttarakhandis entering the regional music industry as</page><page sequence="24">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 47 session musicians, directors, and producers, has, on the one hand, led to the commercial availability of a variety of locally meaningful, idiosyncratic festival music and dance, and on the other hand, has standardized a number of sonic features in Uttarakhandigft (e.g., gendered singing parts, dhol-damaun inspired rhythmic patterns). The habit of dichotomizing musical life into categories of traditional and mod- ern, popular music and folk music, and even production and consumption, has been shown to influence musical behavior in studio and festival settings. In much scholarly discourse, one encounters these terms as a shorthand to signify particular contexts of musical production, means of dissemination, and stylistic tendencies (e.g., Booth and Kuhn 1990). Yet such binary thinking is unhelpful for understanding the broader creative processes under discussion, and it may obscure an awareness of the "filtering" process that Negi anticipates whereby recorded music may evolve into the anonymous folksongs ( lokgit ) of a commu- nity. Conversely, it may obscure an awareness of the process Negi participated in directly, whereby participatory dance-songs were "revived" in villages as a re- sult of commercial recording. Close ethnographic attention to musical feedback between live and mass-mediated performances can enable scholars to develop more nuanced ways of thinking about the evolution of musical style. In spite of the perception that recording studios and festivals in Uttarakhand are settings for respectively "modern" and "traditional" music, it has been demonstrated that a combined value for newness and oldness on the part of all participants involved is what stimulates musical feedback across these settings. University of Cincinnati Notes 1 Elsewhere I have written about the commodification of Baddi git (Fiol 2010b) and jagar possession rituals (Fiol 2010a). While there has been little evidence of video record- ings of j agar influencing live ritual practice, viewers may simultaneously interpret these videos as "real" rituals and "artificial" entertainment, facilitating multiple understandings of authenticity and an experience that I refer to as "dual framing." 2 Although migrant remissions contribute a great deal to the regional economy, Uttarakhandi women's labor in homes, fields, and forests certainly makes up the bulk of the regions economic activity, even if this fact often goes unremarked in economic analyses (Majumdar 1998). 3 In a separate article (Fiol, forthcoming), I examine the role of vernacular-language popular music in sustaining and articulating regionalist movements in Uttarakhand and in other South Asian contexts. Readers interested in the Uttarakhand movement are encouraged to consult Husain (1995), Kumar (2000), and Mawdsley (2002). 4 Binary conceptual models for social change have been influential in South Asian anthropology, from Redfield and Singers model of great and little traditions (1954), to Marriotts model of universalization and parochialization (1955, 197-203). While the circularity of mutual influences between festival and studio-produced dance-songs</page><page sequence="25">48 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 20 1 1 could be evoked through the use of these binaries, I find it less helpful to think in terms of "processes of upward universalization" or "downward parochialization" in this case (Marriott 1955, 201). 5 Despite being variants of the Pahari language family (a subset of the Indo-European language system), Garhwali, Kumaoni, and Jaunsari are regional designations for clusters of dialects that are often mutually unintelligible. 6 The dhol-damaun pair is the heart and soul of much secular and sacred music in Uttarakhand. The dhol is a large, two-headed, barrel-shaped drum slung over the shoul- der with a cloth strap, and played on one drumhead with an open hand, and on the other drumhead with a stick. The damaun, a shallow kettledrum played with two thin sticks, fills in the strong beats of the dhol with more regular pulsations. For a more detailed description of hill bands and brass bands, see Alter (1998). 7 See Greene (1999) for a comparable example of the use of cassette music during festivals in Thanjavur, South India. 8 Some more recent festivals in urban areas (e.g., the Virasat and Saras melds) are partially sponsored by private music companies located in Delhi or the state capital, Dehradun, injecting an overtly commercial influence into the setting. On one occasion, I witnessed a singing talent competition sponsored by T-Series company in which con- tenders sang compositions by the popular artist Narendra Singh Negi on his birthday; the winner was guaranteed a cash prize and a studio recording opportunity in Delhi. 9 Negi s perspective that mass-mediated music can continuously regenerate folk music contrasts sharply with the perspectives of many twentieth century folklorists. A statement of Maud Karpeles (1968) is representative here: "Folk music is the product of an oral tradition. The factors that shape the tradition are continuity, variation, and selection. A song composed for popular entertainment lacks those distinctive features generated by the molding process of oral transmission. Unlike folk song, it remains static or disappears. The creation of folk music is related primarily to the pre-literate stage of a community. In the age of mass-media new folk music can hardly be created, but the folk music we have inherited can be enjoyed for its intrinsic merits." 10 The advertisement campaign was called "Thanda Matlab Coca-Cola" (Cold Means Coca-Cola). Filmed in Manali, Himachal Pradesh, the advertisement depicted a "Gurkha" guide (played by Bollywood actor Amir Khan) humming the tune to "Beru Pako." While the use of this tune was a point of pride for many Uttarakhandis, the fact that it was not filmed in Uttarakhand was also a point of irritation. 11 It did not come as a surprise when, after returning to Dehradun, the producer told me that the sequences recorded in this village would not be used in the final version of the VCD. Despite the efforts of the crew and the reluctant involvement of villagers, his decision was a reminder that the authority over the presentation of "tradition" ultimately rests with producers and performers in plains-based studios. 12 In contrast to the pradhan or official village leader, who may be given certain local administrative responsibilities, the padhan (also called syana) is the unofficial headman of the village and is often a descendant of the original founding family of the village. 13 The earliest commercial recordings of Uttarakhandi musicians were released on 78 rpm records by the Gramophone Company of India (HMV). The first album was recorded sometime in the mid- 1940s by two Kumaoni sisters named Gopi Devi and</page><page sequence="26">Fiol: From Folk to Popular and Back 49 Champa Devi, who, it is rumored, were working as prostitutes in Mumbai. The first Garhwali language album was recorded in 1949 by Jeet Singh Negi, Mohini Sharma, and Keshav Anuragi in Mumbai. While I have been unable to track down these albums, or to adequately assess their influence, it is doubtful that they would have been heard outside of a small group of regional elites who owned gramophone players. 14 Similar developments were taking place in the urban popular music of Nepal. Lokgit recordings since the 1950s have been modeled on village songs and dances (and on the intermediary work of folklorists), with the texts translated into the lingua franca Nepalese (Henderson 2002; Grandin 1989). Paul Greene (2003) has also described the more heavily mediated lok pop genre emerging in the early 1990s, which utilizes a range of studio audio techniques and draws upon more cosmopolitan musical styles. Lok pop singers eulogize mountain village life from a "wide-angle lens, in which [villagers] appear more remote and ephemeral than they actually are" (Greene 2003, 6). 15 Outside of cassette sales, Negis song lyrics are popular in print media. Two booklets of poetry (Negi 1999, 2002) and a Festschrift (Navani and Kughshal 2000), along with countless articles in magazines and regional newspapers, have been published on Negi s work and life. His lyrics are so popular that some commentators have credited them for a resurgence of interest in the Garhwali language, particularly among youth; still oth- ers lament the fact that the Salan dialect has become more dominant than other local dialects of Garhwali. 16 For description and notation of a number of sub-regional rhythmic patterns used in Uttarakhandi git, see Fiol 2008, 211-15. 17 Narendra Singh Negi, Sri Nanda Devi Raj Jat: Garhwali Git , Part 1 &amp; 2, T-Series Cassette (2000). 18 Although Negi is familiar with Hindustani music theory as a classically trained tabla player, he demonstrates little interest in strictly following the conventions of raga theory in this song, or in Uttarakhandi git more generally. The important point is that he and the other studio musicians felt the need to expand the four-note melody of the field recording. 19 Another VCD album, entitled Nanda Devi Raj Jat , was released by Park (Srinagar) just a few days after the pilgrimage had ended in 2000. The producer and singer both hail from the Joshimath region where the raj jat took place. The music for this album, dubbed alongside the video commentary in a single take, is strikingly different from Negis T-Series version. The singer, Darwan Naitwal (from village Nauti), performed a devotional genre ( jagar ) and lament ( khuder ) for Nanda Devi in a very slow tempo, accompanied by a single melodic line on a synthesizer and with indigenous percussion accompaniment on the daunr and thali. Despite low production quality (by the standards of many urban studios) and limited distribution in the hills, the album apparently sold well among regional audiences. I gratefully acknowledge Anoop Sinha for bringing this recording to my attention. 20 The proliferation of the VCD format across Asia over the last decade deserves more scholarly attention. As a relatively inexpensive medium that integrates sonic and vi- sual cultural components, the VCD appears to have intensified the interaction of urban commercial genres and village-based (especially dance-driven) musical forms. In Ut- tarakhand and Nepal, the fact that VCDs are so often filmed in village locations both anticipates and encourages these feedback relationships.</page><page sequence="27">50 Asian Music: Winter/Spring 201 1 References Alam, Juhur (ed.) 2006 Uttarakhand ke Lok Nritya: Jhora, Canceri, Chapeli aur Choliya.
