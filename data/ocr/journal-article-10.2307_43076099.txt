Pritchard was the general director of the excavations at the modern village of Sarafand (ancient Sarepta) on the coast of Lebanon. From 1969 to 1974 (inclusive, except for 1973 which was dedicated to the study of the data and the preparation of a preliminary report) there was every year a three-month season of excavation.</page><page sequence="2">114 Recensiones In this volume, Pritchard presents the objects which were retrieved from Area II, X which was the largest sector excavated at Sarepta. The book is largely a cat- alogue of the aforementioned objects except for ordinary potsherds which "were recorded quantitatively by locus by means of a type series of forms" (p. 2). Prit- chard offers an overview of the material culture that ranges from the later phases of the Middle Bronze Age to the Byzantine period. There are times, however, when several categories of objects are discussed at some length and are also provided with detailed bibliographic references. Such, for example, is the case with the presenta- tion of the Phoenician inscriptions. Pritchard's catalogue is primarily arranged by the categories of artifacts such as inscriptions, charms, and figurines. However, some objects could not have their function identified and therefore they were pre- sented in groups which were set up according to the material they were made of, namely metal, bone, glass, and stone. The political conditions of Lebanon prohib- ited Prichard from re-examining some objects, with the result that his description of objects is uneven (pp. 2-3). The description and study of the objects from Area II, X at Sarepta are well presented by Pritchard. The Table of Contents (pp. V-VI) is followed by the List of Figures (pp. VII- VIII) and the Introduction (pp. 1-6). In the latter, Pritchard sets forth the aims he had in publishing this volume, and he also presents a summary of the method of excavation used at Sarepta as well as the collaborators who helped him both in the field and in the preparation of this catalogue. Chapter I (pp. 7-29) deals with Inscriptions and Marks, whereas Chapter II (pp. 31-71) is a presentation of the Figurines and Masks. Charms and Adornments are dealt with in the follow- ing chapter (pp. 73-92), whereas Whorls and Weights are catalogued in chapter IV (pp. 93-100). The following chapter (pp. 101-125) is about Miscellaneous Objects, whilst the Ceramic Vessels are dealt with in the final chapter (pp. 127-197). Three appendices follow: appendix 1 (pp. 199-200) consists of a presentation of a series of CI 4 dates; appendix 2 (pp. 201-244) is a list of loci in which the catalogued objects from each locus are listed by the field number they were given during the excava- tion; appendix 3 (pp. 244-253) consists of an index of field numbers which are arranged in numerical order and each of which is identified by the object it stands for. Finally there are the Figures (pp. 255-325), consisting of seventy-six plates which contain photographs and/or drawings of the objects mentioned in the catalo- gue. Pritchard's book has a very clear print and the photographs and drawings are of a very good quality. It is a pity that the volume contains far too many mis- prints which the reader can look up for himself on the following pages: p. 5, par. 1, 1. 4; p. 16, par. 2, 1. 4; p. 24, par. 2, 1. 2; p. 26, par. 3, 1. 2 ; p. 47, no. 60, second line from the bottom; p. 65, 1. 1; p. 162, no. 1, last line; p. 168, fourth line from the bottom; p. 180, no. 29, 1.6; p. 181, no. 33, 1.6; p. 182, no. 37, 1.6; p. 185, no. 47, penultimate line; p. 201, par. 1, 1.8; p. 201, par. 1, 1.9. Sometimes, a word is left out: of is missing before a in 1. 1 of the last paragraph on p. 121, and the word ring is left out before the word base in the penultimate line of no. 3, on p. 163. On the other hand, there is an unncecessary reduplication: on p. 179, all of line 7 should be deleted. Besides the foregoing misprints, there are others which are of a more serious nature. Thus, on p. 10, 1. 3 men stands for the letter mem , whereas the letter * stands for ' in the transliteration of Shadrapa's name on the same page (cf. fig. 1:5 and fig. 4:5). In the Greek transcription of Asclepius' name on p. 25, there is a rough breathing instead of a smooth one. Finally, there seems to be a contradic-</page><page sequence="3">Recensiones 1 1 5 tion regarding the total number of figurines found in shrine 1. In the penultimate paragraph on p. 48, Pritchard says that " a total of 36 figurines and fragments were catalogued". However, a few lines further down, he claims that half of the catalo- gued pieces make up nineteen items (p. 48). So is the total amount of figurines that were catalogued thirty-six or thirty-eight? An analysis of the final paragraphs on p. 48 and of the first paragraph on p. 49 does not lead to any solution. The result- ing contradiction could be due to an error in printing: it is likely that some infor- mation was left out. Pritchard's book is replete with very interesting information. With respect to epigraphy, we learn that out of the twenty-one inscriptions in the Phoenician script, eight were retrieved from a sacred precinct, namely the shrine (p. 17). These in- scriptions include the seventh-century b.c. one, in which Tiniťs name makes its first "unequivocal occurrence" in Lebanon (p. 8). An inscription on a scaraboid of green and brown stone reveals that "the place name Sarepta would seem to corre- spond to that found in I Kings 17:9" (p. 11). Pritchard also discusses the first Phoenician inscription which is written in the Ugaritic cuneiform script which runs from left to right. Lloyd W. Daly then tackles an interesting fourth-third century B.c. digraph, the first two lines of which are in Greek and the third in syllabic Cypriote. The inscription is on a fragment of a base in white marble which is broken to the right. Unfortunately, it was found on the surface of a field adjacent to the excavated area. The Greek text "is evidently a dedication of whatever object the base was meant to support" (p. 25); the dedication was made to Ascle- pius, who is also mentioned in the syllabic Cypriote script. The fact that at Sarepta "there is already evidence of the cult of the healing god Eshmun and Shadrapa" (p. 26) makes it very likely that the digraph's origin lies on the site itself. Generally, Pritchard is aware of the importance of the find-spots of the mate- rial that he presents. His analysis reveals the importance of the sacred precinct at Sarepta. Indeed, the majority of the anthropomorphic figurines, and of the scarabs and amulets, and of the beads stem from shrine 1 (p. 96). This fact sheds light on the meaning of the aforementioned objects. On the other hand, the stamped jar handles with the Greek legends do not seem to be associated with any particular area. However, a final answer can only be given when the architecture of the Hel- lenistic quarter is more fully worked out. It is interesting to note that the seventy closed lamps tackled by Pritchard con- stitute the largest collection of this category of finds published from an excavation in Lebanon. His presentation and discussion are very useful, and he provides a solid overview of closed lamps from Sarepta that range from the Hellenistic to the Byzantine periods. On the whole, Pritchard's book is interesting, solid and reliable. However, there are some problems of a general nature too. At times, his work suffers because he did not wait for the results of the stratigraphie analysis of the area where some of the material that he presents was retrieved. Thus, for example, 54% of the stamped jar handles mentioned above came from area II-A-/D-5/6; however, "until the architecture of this section of the Hellenistic city has been more clearly defined it is impossible to say that the high distribution of handles in this area has a meaningful explanation" (p. 24). Pritchard has the same type of difficulty with the figurines. He clearly states that given the stage of the study of the stratigraphy of the areas whence the figurines came, "it is impossible to make generalizations of figurines by strata" (p. 65). Finally, there is an analogous problem with the closed lamps. Out of the sev-</page><page sequence="4">1 1 6 Recensiones enty closed lamps mentioned above, only sixty-five can be dated. When the latter lamps are distributed in chronological blocks, it is seen that twenty-eight belong to the fourth-first centuries b.c., twenty-five are first-century a.d. lamps, whereas the remaining twelve belong to the fourth-fifth centuries a.d. This picture led Prit- chard to conclude that it seems that there is a gap in occupation at Sarepta during the second and third centuries a.d. (p. 195). There are two reasons why one should be wary of this conclusion. In the first place, the lamps that could be dated were "assigned dates on the basis of analogous examples found elsewhere" (p. 194), In this case, Pritchard is making use of the method of pottery chronology which is fraught with difficulties especially with those of circular arguments and non-sequi- turs. Indeed, the period of use of a particular type of vessel can differ from site to site. Secondly, Pritchard does not base his conclusion regarding the aforementioned gap in occupation on stratigraphie analysis. In fact, he himself says that it is pos- sible that the five lamps which he could not date could belong to the centuries for which he postulated a gap in occupation (pp. 194-195). This is a problem of chron- ology which shows how important it is to establish independent means of dating a pottery repertoire from a given phase on a particular site. To adduce typological and stylistic arguments devoid of a stratigraphie basis does not lead anywhere. The foregoing points do not detract anything from the merit which is due to Pritchard for publishing this book. Through it he renders an enormous service to Levantine archaeologists and to any scholar interested in the interactions of trade and culture in the eastern Mediterranean basin in antiquity. Besides, it is obvious that he also makes a great contribution to Phoenician-Punic studies thereby also shedding light on problems of Phoenician archaeology in the central and western Mediterranean.
