Ithaca (New York): Comstock Publishing Asso- ciates (Cornell University Press). $49.95. xxi + 534 p; ill.; index. ISBN: 0-8014-3507-2. 1999. Snakes, either as heroes or villains, have not been prominent in conservation efforts. Typically, they are neither critical ecological keystone taxa nor ecological threats. In addition, snakes do not have large or influential constituencies that advocate vig- orous action for preserving them, as they seem to lack aesthetic, anthropomorphic, charismatic or symbolic wilderness appeal. Thus, it is unfortunate that this book is on snake "management" rather than on snake "conservation," and that the two spe- cies covered pose significant dangers to human safety (habu, Trimeresurus flavoviridis) and a signifi- cant ecological and nuisance threat (brown tree- snake, Boiga irregularis). Both species are large (adult lengths up to 1.7-3.1 m) and venomous. This book is significant for other reasons. It is the product of two largely independent research teams that met for a joint conference. The first is a Japa- nese team that for many years has studied the en- demic habu-a pit viper-on Okinawa and adja- cent islands, centering their work in an institute with enviable facilities for housing, rearing and ob- serving snakes. The second team, composed mostly of Americans, focused on the brown treesnake, a VOLUME 75 192</page><page sequence="2">JUNE 2000 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 193 rear-fanged colubrid introduced on to Guam and responsible for the extermination of several avian species, as well as reductions in numbers of many other vertebrates. It is also responsible for .power outages, and it often invades homes, sometimes bit- ing people. The book is comprised of 39 chapters organized into 7 sections. The chapters and sections are di- vided roughly equally across the two species. The sections cover basic biology, venom and human health, behavioral and sensory biology, population biology, capture and detection, means of control- ling populations, and conservation biology. It is this last section, along with Hariy Greene's Foreword, that situate the often justified fears of snakes into a broader cultural and ecological context. There is much here that would be useful to ecologists, con- servation biologists, natural resource managers, and especially all scientists working in any area of snake biology and behavior. Although most of the chapters focus on only one species, several combine data on both species (e.g., comparison of venom deliveiy systems, phero- monal control and parasites), including the excel- lent internationally authored Introduction and Epi- logue. The chapters, with their diverse topics and state of knowledge, vaiy in depth, coverage and methodological sophistication. In terms of control- ling populations (for example), the design of bar- rier fencing is most advanced for both species, while finding effective prey or sexual attractants to lure these secretive animals to traps has been less suc- cessful. The editors have succeeded in providing a comprehensive progress report.
