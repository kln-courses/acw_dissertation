The Drawing Center, New York, April 16—June 13. When Victor Hugo made his first major drawings, in his early forties, he had already achieved the 19th-century equiva lent ofWarholian media fame as a poet, novelist, dramatist, politician, and journal ist: he was famous most of all simply for being Victor Hugo. From 1830, when riot ing that disrupted performances of his play Hernani was said to have signaled the bap tism by fire of the Romantic movement, to his 19-year exile from France for his oppo sition to Louis-Napoleon, followed by his triumphant return in 1870, to his funeral in 1885 attended by over two million peo ple—more than the population of Paris at that time—Hugo was perceived as larger than life, an embodiment of France itself, engendering at least a dozen eponyms ranging from "Hugolien" to "Hugoïst" to "Hugolâtre." His drawings, which were given their first solo museum exhibition in this country at the Drawing Center, include no self-portraits as such, but many pictures of his name or initials, and towering, anthropomorphic structures that often read as metaphors for the self; while his images of the ocean and his astonishing abstrac tions seem attempts to lose that self in sub mission to natural forces, operations of chance, formlessness, and the unconscious. 40 July-August 1998 Hugo drew primarily in ink, occasion ally gouache and charcoal, but also used coffee, burnt matchsticks, coal dust, soot, squid ink (sepia), blackberry juice, caramelized onion, toothpaste, saliva, and "even less respectable materials," according to Hugo's latest biographer, Graham Robb. (Ed Ruscha's use of various organic or house hold substances in his word paintings of the 70s comes to mind here, not to men tion Warhols urine-splattered Oxidation paintings). In addition to or in combina tion with traditional pen-and-ink draw ing, Hugo's techniques included "pliage or the folding of blotted paper to create double images in the manner of Rorschach blots (again like Warhol, or Bruce Conner), the use of stencil and gum reserve to create dramatic effects of chiaroscuro and mottling, printing with his fingers or with pieces of lace dipped in ink, and "automatic" drawing. Many of his first drawings were straight forward traveler's records of Gothic build ings, whose picturesqueness Hugo, as a member of the Romantic generation, was among the first to appreciate. They led to his impossibly elaborated architectural fan tasies, of which there were several wonder ful examples in the exhibition, particularly Castle Overlooking a River (ca. 1847) and Town With Tumble-down Bridge (1847). Hugo's visionary images of old buildings, castles, towers, bridges, and lighthouses, encrusted with redundant gables, turrets, bow windows, dormers, pennants, buttress es, gargoyles, pinnacles, portcullises, case ments, escutcheons, and half-timbering, echo the redundancies of his poetic language. Drawing was for Hugo an extension of writing, at certain times a substitution for writing, which then became a form of writing. An important series of relatively large drawings dates from around 1850, when his involvement in tumultuous polit ical events in Paris brought his poetry almost to a standstill and redirected his poetic imagination into drawing. The soli tary structures that loom over vast plains in many of these works (Landscape With Castle, 1847; A Tower at Dusk, ca. 1847) have a way of resolving themselves into the initial "H." But if Hugo's many towers and castles are phallic monuments to selfhood, their very blackness can become ambigu ous, reflective, reading as insubstantial shad ow as much as solid mass, like the dark bul warks that frame View of Paris (ca. 1849). Although his work does not fit easily into our notions of 19th-century art, it is wrong to suppose that Hugo was com pletely isolated artistically. He was influ enced by the painters of the Danube School, by 17th-century Dutch prints, especially Rembrandt's, and by Piranesi. His seascapes can remind us of Turners, and his "tacheist" landscapes have parallels in Alexander Cozens s landscape etchings derived from ink blots (published in 1785), as well as the etchings and mono types of Hercules Segers, though it is unlikely Hugo knew these. Even in exile, he kept abreast of the work of contempo rary printmakers like Meryon, Bracque mond, and Doré, and his drawings, which were published as engravings as early as 1838, were praised by Gautier, Baudelaire, and Huysmans. Even though in most cases there can have been no direct influence, it is irre sistible to note some of the striking simi larities between Hugo's work and that of later artists and techniques. Planet (ca. 1854), a large dark orb centered in a dark inde terminate background, calls to mind Redon's "black" drawings and lithographs, or the paintings of the late Dana Garrett. Spiritualist Drawing (ca. 1854), with its ink</page><page sequence="2">Museum Reviews flames biting into the paper, has the inten sity of a drawing by Artaud. Many of the so-called "tache" (ink spot) drawings, such as Composition avec taches (ca. 1875), recall Polke's poured resin paintings, or his pho tographs, milkily fogged with chemicals poured directly onto the paper. Hugo's use of stencils also brings to mind the nega tive/positive principle of photographic printing. As early as 1825, 14 years before Daguerre's invention of photography, Hugo sent his brother-in-law a tracing of the shadows cast by leaves on a page, call ing it "a drawing made by the sun and shadow," and his drawings of the 1850s may have been influenced by his sons' involvement with photography (and pho tograms) at that time, as Marie-Laure Prévost points out in the excellent cata logue to the exhibition. Hugo's lace impressions (which recall Talbot's pho togram of lace, published in 1844 in The Pencil of Nature) are, like the stencils, a kind of monoprinting, and prefigure Max Ernst's "frottages," Philip TaafFe's decora tive patterning, and even Warhol's use of camouflage patterns. From 1853 to 1855 Hugo and his household on Jersey were deeply absorbed in a series of spiritualist séances, during which Hugo conversed with the spirits of Dante, Shakespeare, Racine, Molière, Aeschylus, Galileo, Moses, Jesus Christ, St. Augustine, Voltaire, Androcles's lion, the Ass of Balaam, the Shadow of the Tomb, the Wind of the Sea, Death, the Ocean, and the Shadow's Mouth (who dictated a 600-verse poem, which Hugo published as What the Shadow's Mouth Said). As Luc Sante observes in the catalogue, "[Hugo] had discovered a means of overriding con scious control of his verse." The planchette also made "automatic" drawings, and the two or three of these that are included in the exhibition are less significant in them selves, perhaps, than as tokens of the cru cial role his surrender to the unconscious played in all of Hugo's drawing (and writ ing). Perhaps the most Hugolian of these otherworldly voices was that of the Ocean, images of which pervade Hugo's written and visual work during his years of island exile, when he spent much time in contemplation of it. Appropriately, the exhibition concluded with a series of drawings related to the ocean, some of which Hugo bound into the manuscript of Les travailleurs de la mer (1864—65): ship wrecks (his Disasters series), stormy seas, and a giant octopus whose tentacles form a "V" and an "H." These were shown near the powerful abstraction Composition avec tach es, a late image of metamorphosis and flux spread across a large sheet, folded open book-wise, combining a mysterious small winged figure with large dark abstract blots, Frankenthaler-like stains, and seething splotches like those left by viscera in pho tograms by Adam Fuss. Though it was drawn much earlier, it is fitting that the abstraction known by its inscription, " Toujours en ramenant la plume" ("Always bringing the pen back around"; ca. 1856) should also have been hung near the later images of Ocean and the void, for not only does its record of the artist s hand repetitively working back and forth across the paper read as an image of waves rolling onto the shore, but its inscription seems to sum up Hugo's relationship to his art. What makes Hugo's drawing look and feel so contemporary is that often its method, its process, appears to become its content. "Always bringing the pen back around," Hugo's work exemplifies an untrammeled spirit of experimentation and exploration, rare in any era.—Nathan Kernan -Nathan Kernan</page></plain_text>
