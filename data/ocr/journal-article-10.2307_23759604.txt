There are cies of individual groups and types in this sample are given in several reasons for this situation. First, few figurine collec- Table 2 (groups) and Table 3 (types), tions from Aztec archaeological sites have been adequately published. Archaeologists have published descriptions of small numbers of figurines from Aztec sites (e.g., Brumfiel 1996; Guilliem Arroyo 1997; Otis Charlton 2001; Parsons 1972). Second, aithough there are hundreds (perhaps thou sands?) of whole figurines in muséum collections, very few of these have been published. The best-published collection is the Lukas Vischer collection at the Ethnographie Museum in Basel (Baer 1996), and several other works illustrate small numbers of muséum figurines (e.g., Barlow and Lehmann 1990; Guggenheim Museum 2004; Pasztory 1998). There are several unpublished MA theses on muséum collections of Aztec figurines (Kaplan 1958; Millian 1981). A third reason for the low level of understanding of Aztec figurines is the nature of past scholarly approaches, many of which concéntrate only on the finest examples and ignore the range of variation within the category (e.g., Guggenheim Museum 2004; Matos Moctezuma and Solls Olguln 2002; Pasztory 1998).

Our classification was conservative in this area, leaving for 53 mexicon • Vol. XXVII • April/Juni 2005</page><page sequence="10">others the question of whether some of these représentations were meant to portray deities or perhaps deity impersonators. The Yautepec figurines can be divided into three catégo ries that shed light on processes of trade and stylistic interac tion. These catégories were first isolated by Cynthia Otis Charlton (1993; 1994) on the basis of her study of the figurines from Cuexcomate and Capilso First, some figurines were clearly imported from the Basin of Mexico, most likely through processes of commercial exchange (groups 1,2, and 3). Second, some figurines were made locally in local styles not found in other areas (groups 4, 5, and 11). Third, most figurines were made locally (group 6) in styles that match Aztec figurines in the Basin of Mexico. Otis Charlton (1994:208-209) uses two catégories here: "direct copes" and "locally-made stylistic imitations," but we did not feel quali fied to make this distinction in the Yautepec collection. The abundance of group 6 figurines at Yautepec - and at other Morelos sites like Cuexcomate and Capilco as well (Smith 2005a:chapter B3) - suggests a broad geographical distribu tion of the Aztec figurine style within central Mexico. Similar figurines have also been excavated at Calixtlahuaca in the Toluca Valley (Smith, et al. 2003), and perhaps other high land sites outside of the Valley of Mexico. These three catégories were présent at Yautepec starting in the Pochtla phase or Middle Postclassic period, which corresponds to the Early Aztec period in the Valley of Mexico (Smith 2003a). The presence of both Valley of Mexico imports and locally-made figurines in the Aztec style at this early period indicates that the relevant processes of trade and stylistic interaction long predated the founding of Tenochtitlan (ca. AD 1325) and the formation of the Triple Alliance Empire (AD 1428). There is no evidence to support the considération of the locally made Aztec-style figurines from Y autepec as "imitations" of objects from the Valley of Mexico. People living in both areas were participating in dynamic processes of exchange and interaction, and these interactive processes were probably responsible for the presence of the Aztec figurine style in both régions. It is interesting to note that in the Molotla phase, after conquest of Morelos by the Triple Alliance Empire, the frequency of imported figurines increased while the fre quency of local unique styles declined (Table 2). A similar pattern can be observed in the figurines from Cuexcomate and Capilco (Smith 2005a: cuadro B3-5), suggesting that these data may describe widespread social processes related to the effects of Aztec imperialism in Morelos (Smith 2001; Smith 2004). In any case, the three catégories of figurines are abundant in all phases, including the Early Colonial Santiago phase. Colonial figurines depicting Spaniards (figure 6, A-E) were added to the basic Aztec figurine assemblage, which continued into this time. Although this paper includes only brief descriptions of the Yautepec figurines, the illustrations and data are sufficient to show that Aztec figurines and the Aztec figurine style were not limited to the Valley of Mexico. In this sense, the figurines epitomize the likely distributions of other types of Aztec art and material culture, whose relevant spatial universe was much wider than Tenochtitlan or its immédiate hinterland in the Valley of Mexico (Smith 2003b).

RESUMEN : Este artículo describe una colección de 1,906 fragmentos de pequeñas figurillas de barro excavadas en la zona arqueológica de Yautepec en el estado de Morelos, México. Se presentan tres categorías: 1) figurillas importadas del Valle de México; 2) figurillas hechas al nivel local en el estilo azteca; y 3) figurillas hechas al nivel local, en estilos distintos. La gran mayoría de las figurillas son antropomórficas, con las formas femeninas el doble que las formas masculinas. Datos cuantitativos muestran la abundancia de las categoría varias en cada uno de tres periodos postclásicos y un periodo colonial. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Keramikfigurinen aztekischen Stils aus Yautepec, Morelos: Der Beitrag beschreibt eine Kollektion von 1906 Fragmenten kleiner Keramikfiguren aus dem spät-postklassischen (Aztekische Periode) Fundort Yautepec im mexikanischen Bundesstaat Morelos. Drei Kategorien von Keramikfiguren können beschrieben werden: 1) Importe aus dem Tal von Mexiko, 2) lokal hergestellte Figuren im aztekischen Stil, und 3) lokal hergestellte Figuren in spezifischen lokalen Stilen. Die meisten der Figuren sind anthropo morphisch, dabei sind weibliche Formen doppelt so häufig wie männliche. Tierformen sind ebenfalls weit verbreitet. Seltene Formen sind Rasseln, Tempelmodelle, und andere Dinge. Quantitative Daten gewähren einen Einblick in die Häufigkeit der verschiedenen Kategorien während der drei postklassischen Perioden und der Kolonialzeit. 55 mexicon • Vol. XXVII • April/Juni 2005</page></plain_text>
