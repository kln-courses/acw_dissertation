<plain_text><page sequence="1">TEMPLES OF ANCIENT HADRAMAWT Alexander V. Sedov and Ahmad Bâtâyi Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History, describes Sabota, i.e. Shabwa, the capital of the ancient Hadramawt kingdom, as a fortified town with sixty temples (VI: 154-156). Despite the fact that the French Archaeological Mission which had been investigating the ancient settlement for many years (Pirenne, 1990; Breton, 1992) did not find this number of religious buildings, the Roman historian could hardly be mistaken in his indirect characterization of religious life in the ancient kingdom. Judging by the inscriptions, the number of gods of the ancient Hadramawt pantheon was considerable. Along with Sayyin, the supreme god, the general Hadramawt pantheon included the goddesses Dhat Hymyam (also called Dhat Sahran), QAthtaram and Shamas (the last name occurred only on rock graffiti) and the gods cAthtar, QAmm, Hawl and Wadd. It seems likely that each of the above-mentioned gods had a temple of his own somewhere in the settlement or nearby. There occurred inscriptions with the gods' names in pairs, for example Sayyin and QAmm or Sayyin and Hawl. It can be assumed that there were 'united' temples of these pairs (Beeston, 1984; Ryckmans, 1987). The exploration of numerous ancient settlements in the Wâdî Hadramawt carried out both by the French Archaeological Mission and the Russian-Yemeni Joint Expedition, as well as previous studies, has provided us with valuable and unique material on the Hadramawt temples. Religious buildings, that is the temples intra muros, can be distinguished in nearly every settlement investigated, as, for instance, at Raybûn settlement. Besides temples intra muros, numerous temples were revealed beyond the limits of the settlement, i.e. the temples extra muros. The latter were generally located on a steep wâdî-side, not far from the settlement, such as near al- Hagra settlement. Such a classification, using only one aspect, namely the temple's position, is undoubtedly extremely general (Beeston, 1980, 5-17; Breton and Seigne, 1982, 16-21). One should also take into account the size of religious buildings. Among the extra muros temples it is necessary to single out large temple complexes, such as the al-Hagra temple, or small temples, like Bâ-Qutfa. In the ancient oasis of Raybûn, in the lower reaches of Wâdî Duwan, the Russian-Yemeni Joint Expedition fully or partly excavated temples of different gods of the Hadramawt pantheon. These are the temple of Sayyin dhu Mayfan, the enormous complex of religious buildings located on the steep wâdî-side, the two temples dedicated to the goddess Dhat Hymyam, the Rahban temple at the settlement and the temple of Kqfas beyond the site limits, and the temple of QAstaram dhat</page><page sequence="2">184 Temples of ancient Hadramawt Sedov, Bâtâyic Hadran situated on the outskirts of the ancient town. Besides, in every surrounding settlement we recorded their own temples as well as separate religious buildings. Thus, we have a series of excavated and recorded religious structures dedicated to different gods. This fact allows us to generalise from the material and draw some preliminary conclusions. The sacred territory To all appearances, each structure, whether it was a small temple or an enormous temple complex consisting of several buildings and a number of structures, had its own distinct territorial frontiers. The temple walls were therefore recorded at Husn al- Qays and at Makaynum as well as around the small structures such as the Bâ-Qutfa and Sûna temples or the temple at al-Mashgâ settlement (Breton, 1980, 5-17; Breton and Seigne, 16-2 1 ). However, it is more likely that huge complexes such as the temple at al-Hagra and the temples of Mayfcfan, Kqfas or Rahban had no temple walls. The sacred territory apparently comprised the whole area on which structures and religious buildings were situated and it could be marked by another way than walls. Moreover, around the temple of Dhat Hymyam dhat Kqfas we found, for example, a large area of cultivated land, which had once surrounded the religious buildings. The ruins of an irrigation system - dams, locks and sluices - were preserved. A rectangular network of ancient fields could be clearly distinguished. To the south and west of the temple, in its close vicinity, there were areas with traces of root systems of ancient trees, probably palm and 3říb trees, which had once grown there. The traces could be clearly seen in slanting light. The supposition that in ancient times these farmlands could have been the basis of the temple's economy seems to be justified. The structures We know almost nothing about ancient religious buildings of the early stage of the Hadramawt civilisation, from the late second to the early first millennium ВС. At the Raybûn settlement, under a stone foundation of the Hadran temple, we succeeded in clearing the remains of a small mud-brick structure which had been situated here. It is quite possible that these are the remains of the most ancient of the known religious buildings at Hadramawt. All the other temples investigated in the Wâdî Hadramawt may belong to a rather later stage of the ancient Hadramawt culture, to the second half of the first millennium вс and to a later period. The core of each temple was a building, rectangular in layout, with a hypostyle hall where, probably, the major cults connected with the goďs worship were officiated. As a rule, this building was erected on a high stone platform or socle. The entrance to the building was usually designed in the form of a four-columned propylon, of which only the stone bases and some capitals and parts of wooden column bodies remain. Stone stairs led to this four-columned propylon. These were generally small, two- way staircases situated on both sides of the propylon, but sometimes they were monumental, multi-stepped and about 40-50 m long. Large extra muros temples such as the al-Hagra or MayfaQan temples had particularly stately constructions. A similar type of monumental staircase could be found in intra muros temples such as the Hadran temple at Raybûn settlement. Along with the four-columned propylon a monumental staircase is one of the distinguishing architectural features of the Hadrami temples (Breton, 1980, 15-17).</page><page sequence="3">Temples of ancient Hadramawt Sedov, Bâtâyic 185 In the central building, just opposite the entrance, there was an altar. In almost all structures investigated the position of the altar can be clearly defined. However, as a rule, the altar is so ruined that it is difficult to reconstruct it completely. However, we were lucky enough to be able to do so while excavating the central building of the Kqfas temple. The building turned out to be so well preserved that it is worth describing in detail. The temple was built on a stone socle, rectangular in layout. Its long side was oriented west-east along the axis; its entrance faced east. This eastern side of the building was faced with fine stone slabs on which dedicatory inscriptions were engraved. In front of the entrance was a wide square, a kind of a porch, with a four- columned propylon facing, as has been said, east. A little corridor led into the hall of the main temple. There were two rooms situated on the right- and left-hand side of the entrance. The room on the left (the southern one) had a staircase leading to the roof. Fragments of large vessels for water (?) were discovered in the ruins of this room, high above the floor. Probably once the vessels stood on the roof. The room on the right (the northern one) was likely to have been the temple treasury. Particular features of its layout, such as a high doorstep between the room and the main hall, causing difficulty of access, as well as the character of the find (a large number of glass and stone beads, pieces of gold foil, incense burners and others) speak well for the room's function. The main hall, about 11 x 12 m, was divided by columns into three parts. There was an altar in the central part with a rather complicated layout. Its main part was a cubic platform, not less than 1.3 m high, consisting of a wooden frame filled with stone pebbles. A three-stepped stone staircase was fixed to the platform. An offering table with a long stone gutter was mounted in the floor paving in front of the staircase. Two stone slabs with relief images of ibex or goats were mounted near the gutter of the offering table, while near the north-eastern corner of the altar was revealed a high profiled column with the original incense burner. It is most likely that the entire altar was covered with cloth: burnt pieces of cloth were found at the foot of the altar and on the staircase. Here, on both sides of the staircase, were discovered the remains of offerings: a little bronze mirror, a fragment of a bronze animal sculpture, a gold amulet with an insertion in blue glass, glass and stone beads and so on. At the foot of the staircase were found two pottery vessels, which are typical of the so-called *late Raybûn perioď: a bowl with incised decoration and a goblet on a high base. It is worth mentioning that similar vessels were discovered near the ruins of the altar in the Rahban temple, also dedicated to Dhat Hymyam. It seems that we can speak with good justification about specific temple pottery of certain types. The altar itself was situated in the open air surrounded by a multi-columned covered gallery, where stone benches were erected between the column foundations. All the temple rooms and the main hall were paved with stone slabs, which often bore dedicatory inscriptions. Some fragments had been taken from earlier-period structures of the temple. One of these 'early' dedications contained the name of the temple: Dhat Hymyam dhat Kqfas (dt hmym dt fcfs1). The layout of the central hall unearthed by us in the Kqfas temple is typical of ale temples. The temples of cAstaram dhat Hadran, Dhat Hymyam dhat Rahban, Say у in dhu Madhabum and probably Dayyin dhu Mayfacan demonstrated exactly the same layout, namely the four-columned entrance, the propylon, the rooms on both sides of the passage, the hypostyle hall with the altar in the open air. There is some</page><page sequence="4">186 Temples of ancient Hadramawt Sedov, Batayť difference only in the details of planning, particularly in the number of columns supporting the roof of the hypostyle hall. There are sixteen or eighteen columns in the temple of Hadran while in the temples of Mayfaan and Rahban there are clearly eight. Of special note are the stone benches built between the hall columns in the central buildings of the Kqfas temple. Similar constructions were found by us in all temples excavated, including a supposed cult building of an earlier period which had existed at the site of the Hadran temple. Such benches were also erected in the covered gallery of the Mayfacan temple, along the walls in the room with the well in the temple of Sayyln in Khor Rorî, ancient Sumhuram, the Hadrami fortress on the Dhofar coast (Albright, 1 952 , 1 9-2 1 ), in the shrine situated outside the Say yin temple at the Hureida settlement (Caton Thompson, 1944, 1 9-60). To all appearances, these benches played an important role in the religious ceremonies being held in the temples. It is noteworthy that stone benches were also encountered in the Sabaean and Minean temples: in the Barajan temple at Marib, in the QAthtar temple in As- Sawda3, in the temple of Baraqish (Breton, 1992a). Besides the central buildings nearly all large Hadrami temples had other structures located nearby having a hypostyle hall. Such structures were recorded in the temples of Rahban and Mayfacan. The temple of Dhat Ну my am dhat Kqfas also has this kind of structure, which could indicate the building's function. It was connected with the central building by a passage and also erected on a high stone foundation. Ruins of two hypostyle halls, adjacent but not connected with each other by a passage, and surrounded by small rooms were found. At one time it had been one building with a* huge twenty- five-columned hall. However, later a wall blocked the central row of columns and divided the building into two. In the eastern part of the building we discovered remains of a stone-pebble cubic platform or pedestal (an altar?) with fragments of two large vessels which had once stood on it. On the floor of the hypostyle hall were various votive objects, probably offerings: a bronze spearhead, a bronze dagger, an excellent stone incense burner with an inscribed dedication to Dhat Ну my am and others. Of no less interest is the western part of the building. In the centre of its hypostyle hall was cleared a large fireplace containing the fragments of large vessels, probably for cooking of ritual meals. The low square- and rectangular-shaped stone and mud-brick benches were situated between the hall's columns. In a layer above the floor were numerous table and kitchen pottery fragments which are too great in number for a building of pure religious function. We cannot be sure of the function of the rooms; however, some suppositions could be made. It would be very tempting to interpret the eastern building as a hall for some formal ceremonies and the western one as a refectory where people came to take part in ritual banquets. The indirect supposition that it had been a refectory could be confirmed by findings in a garbage layer, between the central and north- eastern buildings of the temple, i.e. in close vicinity to the entrance of the supposed refectory. The finds included numerous ibex and goat bones. Similar 'heaps of leavings' were recorded by us near the structures with hypostyle halls at the temples of Rahban and Mayfacan. Another kind of building was excavated or recorded in huge temple complexes such as Rahban, Kqfas, Mayfacan or Dhat Hymyam, partly excavated at Shabwa by Hamilton. Its layout is very similar, nearly identical to the Hadrami dwellings which are usually interpreted as aristocratic or rich houses. They were found at the Raybûn site and in Shabwa, recorded at many Hadramawt ancient settlements such as al-</page><page sequence="5">Temples of ancient Hadramawt Sedov, Batayť 187 Mashga, Sûna and others. We can hardly be mistaken in supposing these dwellings to be the houses of priests. Thus, archaeological research has made it possible to make a detailed reconstruc- tion of the general pattern of the Hadramawt temples. Unfortunately, at present the scarcity of the material makes it impossible to single out some characteristic features, typical, for example, of the temple of cAstaram and not of the temple of Sayyin. To all appearances, future investigations will shed light on the problem but for the time being we should point out not only the similarity in general planning of the temples but the coincidence of a number of details in the composition of the temples of different gods. Of special note is the temple of Sayyin dhu эЛ*т, the main temple of the supreme Hadramawt god. The temple is located in Shabwa, the capital of the kingdom. A central street of the ancient city leading to it begins at the north-eastern gates and divides the town into two parts. The French Archaeological Mission, which had been excavating in Shabwa for many years, revealed a monumental stone staircase which led to a four-columned propylon and a huge pedestal intended for a colossal human statue. Small pedestals for statues were situated in front of each column base. Behind the portico there was a narrow ground terrace closed by a wall or a kind of structure which could be a foundation for the main temple building. This construction was erected using ashlar masonry and partly faced with polished stone slabs. The French Mission did not discover the temple building itself. It is quite possible that it was situated somewhere to the south of the propylon and one could enter the temple by one staircase running from an area behind the propylon (Pirenne, 1976, 413-415). The interior decoration of the temple In all probability, the interior of temples and different temple structures was rather simple and monotonous. Inscribed dedications on the walls of buildings, both inside and outside, on steps, on benches and on stone paving slabs played an essential if not predominant role. Besides inscriptions on facing slabs, special dedicatory stelae, musnad, were mounted inside and outside the structures. It is not quite clear whether they were special rooms where these stelae could be kept for a long time, as in the cAwwam temple in Marib. In the temple of Mayfcfan we discovered, for instance, the dedicatory stelae mounted on special stone pedestals. Such constructions were erected in the covered gallery around the central temple building. Parts of the same pedestals are know from Bâ-Qutfa temple (Breton, 1979, Pis Villa, IX). An important role in the temple interior was perhaps played by imagery. When excavating temples in the Wâdî Hadramawt, we often find the pedestals of small and large statues. Usually they have traces of fastenings form figures which had once been placed on them. There occur sculptures themselves but more often only their fragments. Sometimes figurines represent animals, often very stylised. They apparently symbolised not only sacrificial animals but the zoomorphic representation of a deity, his animal manifestation. Sayyin, for instance, was represented by a bull and an eagle (according to the inscriptions and images on the Hadrami coins). Of special interest is the fact that the French Archaeological Mission found in the temple of Sayyin dhu эЛт at Shabwa several stone pedestals for animal statues, most probably bulls, apparently life-size. These pedestals were situated just to the north- east of the monumental staircase (J-F. Breton, personal communication). However, anthropomorphic figures are more numerous. These sculptures could be higher than a man, like the statue which once stood on the pedestal near the propylon of the</page><page sequence="6">188 Temples of ancient Hadramawt Sedov, Bâtâyic temple In Shabwa, or the small ones like the figurine from one of the Blcr Hamad temples. Who does the human imagery represent? It is believed, since the first bronze statue of Mcfadl Karib in the temple of cAwwam in Marib was found, that they were images of noblemen, aristocratic donatore of the temples. It is quite possible that the statues in the Hadramawt temples were of this character. The majority of pedestals remaining from these statues have a standard dedicatory formula, namely *Such-and- such a person dedicated to such-and-such a goď. At the base of the niche in the Mayfcfan temple, where a statue probably once stood, there was the following inscription: t:&gt;Ilhumaw, qayn of Raybûn, son of...'. However, Pirenne in her day, and in our opinion rather successfully, tried to prove that some south Arabian sculptures were the anthropomorphic representations of south Arabian gods such as Dhat Ну my am or ^Ilmaqah (Pirenne, 1965). In a series of bronze Hadrami coins with the eagle on the reverse there is a representation of a male head with long ringlets on the obverse. The legend on the obverse can be easily read as Say у in. On the obverse of another series of Hadrami coins there is a representation of a male (?) head surrounded by rays. In monetary iconography that was the usual way of representation of a solar and sometimes lunar deity. Thus, the question of a possible anthropomorphic representation of some south Arabian gods or perhaps those of the Hadramawt pantheon should be solved positively. Is the head on the obverse of the Hadrami coins just the representation of the statue of the supreme Hadramawt god Sayyin, perhaps, standing once in front of the temple propylon on Shabwa? In our opinion it is reasonable to believe so. Along with the sculptures, the interior of the Hadramawt temples was decorated with mural painting. During the 1984 excavations we revealed in the Rahban temple the fragments of unfortunately badly preserved polychromie frescoes covering the stone-slab inner facing of the hypostyle hall. There were fragments with images of people, fish and plants. Separate parts of the interior of the temple, for example altars, were covered with textiles and the floors of the rooms with wickered palm mats. On the walls of the ceremonial halls were hung votive weapons and some other votive objects such as in the Kqfas temple. In addition, in specially assigned parts of temple rooms were large vessels, apparently for water, and incense burners. Sacrificial tables with long gutters intended for the blood of sacrificial animals were mounted in the paving. The bodies of rectangular-section columns in hypostyle halls and propylons were made of wood. As a rule they were coated with clay or gypsum. The bases and capitals of the columns were made of stone and usually were of prismatic or truncated- pyramid shape. The roofs of the buildings and galleries were decorated with triangular antefixes, as in the MayfaQan temple. Special attention was paid to the lower and upper parts of the wall's facing, to corners, staircases and doorways. Here profiled and decorated facing slabs were assembled. A special subject for investigation could be the decor of the stelae-musnad. Besides the stylised bucranians or antelope and ibex heads, they bear rather realistic images of different animals, for example panthers in the so-called 'heraldic' pose, standing on their hindlegs. The ritual It is hard to say definitely what kind of rituals were performed in the Hadramawt temples. Unfortunately south Arabian inscriptions and other written sources give practically no evidence for this subject. But, as is known, temple inscriptions say that</page><page sequence="7">Temples of ancient Hadramawt Sedov, Batayť 189 dedications were made by the order of deities, in compliance with an oracle, to fulfil a vow, or when asking a favour. The themes of the inscriptions included requests for help, for deliverance from troubles, for prosperity or for protection. Sometimes it is a peculiar 'report' of an administrator of high rank about his activities, for instance as a kabir 'for Sayytn and for people', like the inscription from the Mayfcfan temple. However, what concrete actions were performed by priests and visitors is open to question. Nevertheless, taking as a basis the results of our archaeological excavations we can draw a conclusion. In the temple of Dhat Hymyam dhat Kqfas the principal rituals dealing with the deity were, probably, performed in the central building, around the large cube-shaped altar. A sacrificial table with a long gutter for animal's blood was installed in front of the altar. Here, on a high-columned incense burner, the incense was burned and different offerings were placed. Ceramic vessels of certain shapes were used for ritual ceremonies. A large vessel stood above the altar and was also used for a kind of ceremony. Judging by the fact that the altar frame was made of wood while the altar itself was covered with textile, any ceremonies connected with open fire should be excluded. It is most likely that a priest stepped up to the altar to preach or to offer up his prayers directly to a deity. Temple visitors probably settled themselves under the roof of the hypostyle hall, on both sides of the altar. It is hard to say whether it was a ceremony to walk round the altar. Anyway, the visitors had enough space to do so. In the temple of Mayfcfan the covered gallery found the central temple building seemed to play an important role in the rituals. In a little room in the corner of the gallery were found small pieces of frankincense trampled into the floor. In the other room were carefully plastered baths intended perhaps for ablutions. In the Rahban temple, at the foundation of the central building, there was also found a large stone basin for water. In the Hadran temple the stone basin was found at the staircase, near the four-columned propylon. Both the Rahban and the Hadran temples had wells in their close vicinity. Large stone mortars were found in the Rahban, Hadran and Kqfas temples. In the gallery of the MayfaQan temple there was a stone altar for incense burning. In the centre of this altar was found a very smoky large vessel in which, in all probability, the incense was burned while the aromatic smoke was spreading over the gallery through the system of holes in the altar. The gallery had a fine pavement with stone slabs; perhaps it was a ceremony to walk around the main building. We have described special kinds of rooms or halls in the large temples. It seems reasonable to assume that these halls were refectories for ritual meals. Written sources testify to the existence of such ritual ceremonies in ancient south Arabia. It is believed that Jabal al-Lawd, one of the largest cult places in the north of Yemen, was just intended for this kind of king's ritual meals devoted to some common Sabaean public ceremonies (Robin and Breton, 1982). The epithet of the supreme god of Hadramawt who was worshipped in Shabwa was Sayyin dhu 3/Hm, which, according to J. Ryckmans, means 'Sayyin of (the) banquets' (Ryckmans, 1973, 37). It appears doubtful that the refectories in the temples of Kqfas, Mayfacan or Raban can be considered as special rooms for common Hadramawt ritual banquets. However, in our opinion, there is no doubt that these rooms served for this kind of ritual ceremony, but on a local scale. Even at present in Hadramawt, Mahra and other districts of Yemen any ritual ceremony referring to the pre-Islamic period, such as for instance the rite of rogation for rain or the ritual hunt, is accompanied by collective meals.</page><page sequence="8">190 Temples of ancient Hadramawt Sedov, Batayť Some ritual ceremonies took place outside the temple buildings. Thus, in the temple of Say y in dhu Madhabum by the entrance to the central building there were small shrines consisting of altars standing apart from each other, groups of votive objects, sacrificial tables and stelae surrounded by a little oval fence (Caton Thompson, 1944). To the north-west of the Dhat Ну my am dhat Kqfas temple, on one of the neighbouring mounds, were erected gigantic stone stelae which had probably been used in a ritual. The sources and the genesis: The interaction of the temples of different gods If we compare general architectural planning with the interior details of composition of Hadramawt, Sabaean or Minean temples, we can see numerous similar features, namely hypostyle halls, cella with an altar situated in a part of the building just opposite the entrance in the open air, entrance designed as a multi-columned propylon, dedicatory stelae, and inscriptions and sculptures in the temple interior (Schmidt, 1987). This kind of similarity can be explained, at least, in two ways. In the late eighth to early seventh centuries вс a strong flow of Sabaean influence was recorded in the material culture of Hadramawt. It is quite possible that this influence was reflected in the composition or design of the Hadramawt temples. However, in our opinion, it is more likely, if not true, to explain these similarities by the availability of a common ancient Semitic source which gave rise to the development of Sabaean and Minean as well as of Hadramawt religious architecture. The problem of the interaction or co-subordination of different temples is completely unexplored. No doubt all Hadramawt temples recognised the supremacy of the central temple of the supreme god of Hadramawt, the Say yin dhu *Ilim temple in Shabwa. In the series of inscriptions discovered, for example, in the Raybûn temples, it was clearly recorded that the temple of Say y in dhu Mayfacan submitted to the temple of Say y in dhu ^Ilim. On the other hand, our 1991 expedition discovered in the Kqfas temple the inscription concerning, according to Lundirťs interpretation, a dedication for the temple of Dhat Ну my am made 'by order of Say yin dhu MayfaQarì. This inscription provided us with the first valuable and important information on the interaction of the different gods and temples of Hadramawt. References Albright, F.P., 1982.
