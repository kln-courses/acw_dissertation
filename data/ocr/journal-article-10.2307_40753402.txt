<plain_text><page sequence="1">The God of the Philosophers Kenneth Seeskin Although philosophers have discussed God from the time of the ancient Greeks, people have long argued that the conception of divinity that emerges from philosophic literature is not the same as that which emerges from Scripture. One is the product of reason, the other of re- velation. As the Rabbi in Judah Halevi's Kuzari asserts:1 I believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, who led the Israelites out of Egypt with signs and miracles; who fed them in the desert and gave them the (Holy) Land, after having made them traverse the sea and the Jordan in a miraculous way; who sent Moses with His Law, and subse- quently thousands of prophets, who confirmed His law by promises to those who observed, and threats to the disobedient. As the Rabbi admits later on, there can be nothing in the Torah that contradicts what reason has established.2 So there is no question of believing in a God who looks like a human being and sits on a throne in heaven. Still the Rabbi's view contrasts sharply with that of the phi- losopher, who believes in a God who is the first cause of the universe but has no emotions and takes no notice of human beings.3 For many people, the Rabbi's opinion has become part of the ac- cepted teaching of Jewish philosophy. No less an authority than Julius Guttmann observed: "The God of Philosophy, whether in the Neopla- tonic version of the highest unity or in the Aristotelian version of the highest thought, is radically different from that of the personal, willing, and ethical God of the monotheistic religions."4 Even if Guttmann is right, and there is a radical difference between these conceptions of 1 Kuzari, 1.11 (Heineman trans). 2 Kuzari, 1.67. 3 Kuzari, 1.1. 4 Julius Guttmann, The Philosophy of Judaism, D.W.

To get started, let me make two suggestions. First that we drop the designation "God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Although we know how they reacted to God, we know very little about how they conceived o/God. Second that we drop the designation "the God of philosophy" because philosophers have never reached unanimity on what God is. Rather than think in terms of an either/or dichotomy, I want to ap- proach this issue by looking at three traditions: two of which derive from the history of philosophy, one of which derives from Biblical and Rabbinic literature. It will come as no surprise that each tradition claims it is talking about a being than which no greater can be conceived be- cause each has a different understanding of perfection. Perfection as Richness of Essence The first conception has its roots in Plato and Aristotle but finds its clearest expression in the thought of Plotinus: perfection is understood in terms of richness or self-sufficiency. In the words of Plotinus, God seeks nothing, has nothing (independent of himself), and needs noth- ing.5 God then is the source from which everything else proceeds and to which it seeks to return. Again from Plotinus, God is "the source of being and the why of being, giving both at once."6 In this way, all things are contained in God in the sense that their being is derivative and can be seen as an expression or modification of God's being. To continue with Plotinus, the world proceeds from God not because of any action God has taken or choice God has made but simply by virtue of what God is: a perfect being. The consequences or effects of this perfection flow from God in a manner that is both necessary and continuous. There is no decision to make because it is impossible for God not to produce everything he is capable of producing. Nor can God decide to hold back or limit his production. Although one can speak of creation in this context, one does not mean a point in the past when the world came to be but the eternal dependence of the world on God. To use a familiar example from the Neo-Platonic tradition, the in Kenneth Seeskin, Searching for a Distant God (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000). 5 Enneads, 5.2.1 6 Enneads, 6.8.14.</page><page sequence="3">(2006) The God of the Philosophers 207 moon can be said to possess created light from the sun not because there was a point when the sun first began to shine but because the light reflected by the moon is completely dependent on the sun. The precedent for this view of perfection goes back to Timaeus 29e, where Plato suggests that perfection manifests itself as generosity or abundance. Expanding on this principle, Plotinus claims that all things necessarily produce from their own substances a surrounding reality directed to what is outside them, a kind of image of themselves.7 Thus fire produces heat, snow produces cold, and perfumed things produce fragrance. Because all things produce offspring, God, who is the most perfect thing, produces eternally. A God who was self-enclosed or pro- duced nothing would therefore be a contradiction in terms. The difference between Plato and Plotinus is that the former has the Demiurge deliberate and consult an eternal model before creating the world while the latter regards deliberation as a sign of weakness and indecision. Rather than think and then do, Plotinus' God just is, and all of reality proceeds as a result of his being. The rationale for Plotinus' position is clear: If God must take specific steps to create the world, his perfection is not sufficient to produce the world on its own and some- thing else would be needed above and beyond that perfection. The effects of this doctrine are to deny to God anything that we normally associate with personality. As we saw, God is responsible for the world in the same way that fire is responsible for heat: given the nature of the cause, the effect cannot help but follow. Strictly speaking, it would be better to describe this God as a first principle than as a deity in the traditional sense. In addition to Plotinus, this view finds its way into the thought of Proclus, Alfarabi, Halevi's philosopher, and even- tually Spinoza. Not only does it rid God of any hint of anthropomorph- ism, it relieves God of any taint of partiality. There is no question of favoring one group over another because there is no such thing as show- ing favor at all. As Spinoza says: strictly speaking God does not love or hate anyone.8 The purpose of human life is to love God, which means to rise above the particular features of one's own situation and contemplate the universe sub specie aeternitatis. This raises the question of whether it is possible to love or praise such a God. It is clearly possible to love a being who chose to create the world and make me part of it, but what sense does it make to love something simply for being what it is - if we agree that it is impossible for it to be otherwise? In Halevi's terms, what 7 Enneads, 5.1.6. 9 Ethics, 5.17.C.</page><page sequence="4">208 Kenneth Seeskin JSQ 13 sense does it make to love something that is not really God but more appropriately described as a first principle? For many people, this conception of divinity also raises the question of pantheism. If all of reality proceeds from God, or, to look at it an- other way, if the richness of God's essence is manifested everywhere in the world, one has to take special precautions to say how God and the world are different. In various places Plotinus claims that God is in all things, is the productive power of all things, or even is all things.9 Though it could be argued that Plotinus' God is logically prior to the world and therefore separate from it, we can understand why early Christians felt uncomfortable with the idea of procession and held that unlike the persons of the trinity, who emerged from the essence of God and are still in some sense a part of that essence, the world was created ex nihilo. In Jewish tradition, the pantheist objection was raised against Spinoza, who maintains that all things exist in and are conceived through God.10 Perfection as Agency As I mentioned earlier, we should be careful not to identify the previous conception of God with philosophy because there is another tradition, one I would associate with Maimonides, Aquinas, Leibniz, and to a certain extent Kant. Unlike the first conception of God, this one in- volves action and freedom of choice. Along these lines, Maimonides claims that belief in creation is second in importance only to belief in the unity of God and that both were espoused by Abraham.11 It hardly needs to be said that the view I am attributing to Maimonides has been disputed for centuries and that there are still people who think he is committed to a version of the Plotinian view. Because I have argued at length that such an interpretation is not supported by the text, I will not repeat myself here.12 According to the present option, the world is not only dependent on God, but dependence and contingent. This means that it is possible God could have created a different world or no world at all. Thus the fact that God created this world is not due to any inherent necessity in God 9 Enneads, 4.5.7, 5.3.15, 5.5.9, 6.8.18, 6.5.1. w Ethics, l.d. 5. 11 Guide of the Perplexed, 2.25, 3.50. 12 Kenneth Seeskin, Maimonides on the Origin of the World (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).</page><page sequence="5">(2006) The God of the Philosophers 209 but to an act of will. As Maimonides puts it: "What exists, its causes, and its effects, could be different from what they are."13 Once we admit that the world came to be by an act of will, we have a God to whom it makes sense to offer praise and thanksgiving, an agent rather than a first principle. Reduced to simplest terms, existence is a gift, something we have been given but have no right to demand. With will and contingency, we get purpose. According to Maimonides, to say that something exists for a purpose is to say (1) that its existence is contingent, and (2) that what- ever is responsible for its existence chose to make it this way rather than that.14 So it makes sense to say that the world exists for a purpose that is bound up with the goodness of the creator. Accordingly the creator has taken responsibility for the world and has some interest in what happens to it. Once we have purpose, we have the possibility of an end or goal of existence and thus the idea of redemption. In short this alternative asserts that will, purpose, and redemption are not only compatible with the God of the philosophers, they are required by it. The question is whether we want to go beyond will to the more troublesome idea of personality. As we normally understand it, person- ality refers to the traits, dispositions, virtues, and vices a person exhibits over time. In Jewish tradition, God reveals the substance of the divine personality at Exodus 33^: a benevolent ruler who wants justice but recognizes that his subjects are fallible and need to be forgiven. No matter how committed one is to Maimonides, it is hard to read these lines and not think of God in anthropomorphic terms. The pas- sages that assign physical qualities like arms and legs to God can be reinterpreted without much difficulty. But this passage is different be- cause it says that if there is a resemblance between God and us, it is not in respect of arms and legs but in respect of something that goes to the core of our understanding of ourselves: the ability to feel compas- sion. Were it not for the fact that Maimonides and the rest of the phi- losophic tradition would shudder, I would be tempted to say that more than any other passage in the Torah, this passage reveals the human side of God. To understand what is at stake here, let us return to the issue of divine volition. On either philosophic alternative we have considered, God is not subject to change and does not manifest character traits or disposi- tions. So it is wrong to imagine God listening to court cases and re- 13 Guide, 3.13. 14 Guide, 2.20.</page><page sequence="6">210 Kenneth Seeskin JSQ 13 sponding to appeals for leniency. How then can we say that God exer- cises free will? The usual answer is to follow Aquinas (who may have been influenced by Maimonides) and distinguish between willing change and changing one's will.15 Consider a judge who is inclined to rule that a person is guilty, then hears an impassioned speech by a defense attorney, searches her soul, and comes down on the side of acquittal. This person has changed her will. Since this kind of change can take place only if the original decision is overturned, it obviously implies imperfection. Now consider a judge who decides that someone is guilty and should pay a fine, serve a jail term, then be set free on probation. In this case, no decision is overturned. Rather than a change of will there is one decision that requires several stages to be implemented. It is like decid- ing to write a book: what the agent commits himself to in the blink of an eye may involve a series of acts to be carried out over a period of time. In short there is agency without indecision. If we are going to ascribe volition to God, we should think of it along these lines - rather than a willingness to revise one's intention as new problems or opportunities present themselves. If this option is sound, there is no point trying to persuade God to alter the course of the world as people do on Yom Kippur when they plead with God to erase the evil decree that has been entered against them. Nor is there any point in asking for miraculous intervention to save drowning victims or bankrupt financial institutions. Like most re- ligions, Judaism allows prayers of petition. To the degree that they en- courage repentance and inculcate fear of God, they serve an important social function. But in the last analysis, God cannot undergo change or feel emotion.16 To cross that barrier is to worship not God but a glor- ified version of a human being. So it is wrong to suppose there is a heavenly court in which God renders a separate judgment every time we ask to be forgiven. Rather than personality traits that manifest themselves in a temporal setting like a courtroom, the qualities revealed to Moses at Exodus 33-4 should be understood as permanent features of the world. Graciousness has to do with God's decision to create beings who have no claim to be created, mercy with the fact that nature provides for living creatures by endowing them with faculties needed to protect themselves, anger with the fact that nature is unkind to creatures who abuse or fail to develop their faculties, etc. Once again, everything comes down to creation and the 15 Summa Theologica, 1.46.1, cf. Guide 2.18. 16 Guide, 1.35.</page><page sequence="7">(2006) The God of the Philosophers 2 1 1 plan or purpose God chose for it. If, as Kant says, the only thing that is good without qualification is a good will, we have no choice but to ascribe will to God.17 Not to do so might give us something richer, older, and more self-sufficient than a human being, but it would not give us something better. Like the first alternative, this one seeks to demythologize religion by playing down the importance of miracles and denying that God can feel emotion. Taking Maimonides as its representative, the problem is that for all his efforts to reconstruct Judaism along rational lines, his version of the religion is still a hard pill to swallow. At several places, e.g, his understanding of repentance, he has no choice but to say that the ma- jority of followers should be told one thing, the educated few who can hear the truth without abandoning their belief in God something differ- ent.18 This has led to countless debates over what Maimonides' position was and how far he strayed from the Biblical and Rabbinic view of God. My own reading is that he tried to capture the essence of that view by defending the idea of agency. But the agency he has in mind is solitary. God creates the world in a single act that no one else can imitate, let alone understand. There is in his view no room for reciprocity or part- nership as we understand them. Though we can love God, other than conferring the gift of existence, it is hard to see how or why God should love us in return. Needless to say, the Maimonidean alternative strikes many as a form of atheism. Each time we demythologize religion by stressing the trans- cendence of God, we take away one of the features that people want to cling to. If Maimonides taught us anything, it is that all people - Jews included - are subject to a powerful tendency to worship a glorified image of themselves. Tell them that this image is a figment of their imagination and they will accuse you of saying that God is a figment of their imagination. Here I feel the deepest sympathy with Emmanuel Levinas, who argues that if the process of demythologizing religion runs the risk of atheism, it is a risk that must be run.19 17 Kant, Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morals, 393. 18 Guide, 3. 36. 19 Emmanuel Levinas, "A Religion for Adults," Difficult Freedom, trans.

God's power to forgive is infinite even if we do not understand the way it operates. According to Exodus 33:19: "I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and merciful to whom I will be merciful." What right do we have to impose limits on this prerogative? The chief argument in favor of this alternative is that the idea that change implies imperfection is legacy of Greek philosophy for which there is no biblical precedent. Arbitrary change is a sign of imperfection; but it does not follow that we should regard openness to needs of human beings the same way - especially if those human beings have appealed to God for mercy. Does the Torah not say that God backed down when confronted by appeals from Abraham and Moses? Would the narrative have re- vealed a higher degree of perfection if God had refused to budge? If the answer is yes to the first question and no to the second, it is wrong to think of perfection in terms of invariance. Following Rosenz- weig, bringing the world into existence is not enough for God to reveal the full nature of his perfection because it still allows God to remain distant and mysterious; instead God must reach out to the inhabitants of the world in an act of love.20 We can think of love in terms of the commandment given at Deuteronomy 6:5 or in terms of a willingness to forgive iniquity. But no matter how we think of it, love involves a degree of reciprocity that neither of the philosophic alternatives allow for. But here too there are problems. An extreme version of this alterna- tive - say one that would appeal to Alghazali, Descartes, or Kierkegaard - would claim that there are no grounds for objecting to the idea of an arbitrary God. To put limits on what God can do or decide is to posit something superior to God, which is clearly absurd. On the whole, ex- treme voluntarism of this sort has not taken root in Jewish soil because traditional sources clearly imply that God is bound by the limits set forth in his own Torah. God, in other words, is a being under law even if the law is one of his own making. Still the problem with perfection as personality is that it opens the door to partiality. If the laws set forth in the Torah are necessary for human salvation, why did God reveal them to Israel rather than to one of the other nations? Or rather: why did God not reveal them to every 20 The Star of Redemption, 2. Revelation.</page><page sequence="9">(2006) The God of the Philosophers 2 1 3 nation? If, on the other hand, these laws are not necessary for human salvation, why are Jews obliged to obey them? Mendelssohn wrestled with these questions, but as far as I can see, never reached a settled conclusion. He did argue however that partiality is a vice. A God whose revelation is based on historical accidents, a God who leaves much of humanity in the dark regarding his intentions, is therefore not a being than which no greater can be conceived. In fact, partiality is the usual criticism made against Halevi, who believed that natural born Jews are closer to God than anyone else and that Jews living in the Holy Land are closer than Jews in the Diaspora. One way to understand the rationalism of Maimonides is to see it as a rejection of this attitude. To put this point another way, the problem with the Biblical and Rabbinic view is that God becomes too close, too ready to forgive, too tailor-made to suit the needs of a particular group. From a philosophic perspective, the greatest danger we face in talking or thinking about God is that we will miss God entirely and end up worshipping a projec- tion of our own imagination. The more available God becomes, the more disposed to uphold our point of view and our way of life, the greater the likelihood that we have succumbed to this tendency. That is why Maimonides insists that God does not resemble a human being in any respect. The truth is however that despite the lip service it pays to the second commandment, the sacred literature of Judaism fosters a seemingly irre- sistible impulse to think of God in human terms. Faced with the Scylla of idolatry and the Charybdis of abstraction, Jewish tradition typically comes down on the side of the former, at least in its public pronounce- ments. The reason is easy to understand. If we cannot think of God in hu- man terms, what other terms will we use? What other comparison will allow us to offer a higher level of praise or thanksgiving to God? While a person with the mental discipline of Maimonides might be able to say that we should train ourselves not to attribute positive qualities to God and be content with a form of learned ignorance, the majority of people will never be able to accept this. So there is no alternative but to say that God loves us, wants to be loved in return, listens to our pleases, and grants absolution. But what do we say about God's relation to the rest of humanity? Why is God more pleased with Israel than with anyone else? Why would God reveal important messages to us but be silent when it comes to others? And if this is what God does, is personality really a form of perfection?</page><page sequence="10">214 Kenneth Seeskin JSQ 13 Conclusion To return to the question with which we began: Is the God of philoso- phy a being than which no greater can be conceived? In true philosophic spirit, the answer is: It depends which understanding of perfection you prefer. The reason I side with the philosophic understating is that I do not regard perfection as an idea that is easily accessible, especially if we are talking about perfection simpliciter rather than perfection of a kind: the perfect horse, the perfect house, the perfect husband. To arrive at an understanding of perfection simpliciter, we have to go beyond the times in which we live, the part of the world we inhabit, the religion we prac- tice, and try to adopt some measure of what Thomas Nagel calls the view from nowhere.21 Though there are obvious problems involved in saying what the world looks like when seen from nowhere, I feel comfortable in saying it is not a human-centered world so that the tendency to think of God in human terms has to be overcome. If Maimonides and his cohorts are right, agency is not the same as humanity. God's will is free from hindrances or incentives and seeks nothing outside itself. From the perspective of Plotinus or Spinoza, even agency concedes too much to human beings and should be rejected. But it is here that I would draw a line. If we have to give up the idea that God can be measured in our terms, we also have to give up the idea that we are necessary features of the universe whose existence can be viewed as a finite manifestation of a metaphysically perfect being. When push comes to shove, our existence is contingent and our estimate of our own importance almost certainly too high. If that is the case, the Maimonidean alternative takes us as close as we are likely to get to a being than which no greater can be conceived. Again I reject the claim that this being is best described as "the God of philosophy." Maimonides went to great lengths to show that it is also the being whose name is shrouded in mystery, whose face cannot be seen by mortals, and who addressed Job from the whirlwind. Though Mai- monides argues that the world was created for a purpose, he argues with equal intensity that we cannot know what that purpose is and that there is no reason to think it was made for our benefit.22 If this is a difficult pill to swallow, the God who spoke to Job warns us that we are making a serious mistake if we try to sugarcoat it. 21 Thomas Nagel, The View from Nowhere (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986). 22 Guide, 3.13.</page></plain_text>
