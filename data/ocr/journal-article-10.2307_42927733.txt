In the Altai region, archaeologists from the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences in 1961-63 excavated in a late Palaeolithic (terminal Pleistocene-initial Holocene) settlement on Urozhainaia Sopka in the Biisk area and discovered sites of the same age at Gornaia Shorii and Staryi Kuznetsk. An unexpected feature was the combination of the usual pebble technology with the Levallois technique of core production. The latter evidently penetrated the Altai from Mongolia. Similar cores also occur in the Fergana Valley, Soviet Central Asia. The year 1964 produced perhaps the earliest evidence of man's presence in Siberia from two localities: Bobkovo in the Rubtsovsk district (northwestern foothills of the Altai), where an indubitable blade of Levallois-Mousterian type was found in a deposit assigned by geologists to the second half of the Middle Pleistocene (Okladnikov and Adamenko 1966); and Ulalinka near Gorno-Altaisk, where a pebble chopper, scraper, and split pebbles were recovered from a deeply-buried stratum evidently of considerable age, possibly dating back to the first half of the Middle Pleistocene. In 1967 the Hermitage Museum sent a party to the Pazyryk area to investigate the Usť- Balyktyiul cemetery. This proved to contain 548 burial structures divisible into three temporal stages. The oldest can be equated with the famous Pazyryk culture; those of the middle period date from the first half of the first millennium A.D. ; the latest represent Turkish tribes {Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 182-183). The central basin of Tuva - the headwaters of the Yenisei - is the scene of operations of the largest undertaking ever organized by the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences, the Sayan-Tuva Expedition, which will carry out salvage work in the future reservoir area of the Sayan- Shushen hydroelectric project over the period 1965-72. The 150 members of the scientific staff are divided The author is a Professor in the Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin.</page><page sequence="2">2 Asian Perspectives, xiv, 1971 into sections which specialize in the archaeology of some period from the Palaeolithic to the 19th century; there are also sections for ethnographic and environmental studies, and aerial reconnaissance. The great bulk of archaeological remains in Tuva are kurgāns or other types of burials, and the majority of these belong to the Mongun-Taiginsk culture of the early stages of the Bronze Age or perhaps even earlier (the oldest known kurgāns, at Argalykty II cemetery, are Eneolithic or very early Bronze Age). However, excavations were carried out in sites of all periods : kurgāns of the Scythian period (5th-3rd centuries b.c.), an Inner Asian variant of the Pazyryk culture; sites of the Hun-Sarmatian period (1st centuries B.c.-lst centuries A.D.), again a local variant. Ancient Turkish remains (6th-9th centuries A.D.- the period of the formation of the ancestors of the modern Turkic peoples and of the formation of the big nomad states) threw light on the periodization, social structure, and ethnic territories of this time. There are also many sites in the area from the Yenisei Kyrgyz kaganate (9th-10th centuries); excavations in one cemetery yielded data that will help to date the famous Yenisei script inscriptions. The 17th-19th century burials examined provide a link between the expedition's archaeological and ethnographic studies. An extensive search for Stone Age sites in the first season (1965) turned up only a few surface finds, indicating that Pleistocene man did not reach the area of intensive Palaeolithic occupation on the middle Yenisei by following the river downstream. In the following year a typologically Mousterian surface site was discovered at Chinge-Dag-Uzhu, and, elsewhere, four late Palaeolithic and fourteen Neolithic surface sites. Finds of pottery are very rare on the latter, and of a nonde- script sort. The main effort in 1966 was devoted to cemeteries of all periods. Mongun- Taiginsk culture remains were found stratigraphically under those of the Scythian period, confirming the assumed antiquity of the former. The first finds in Inner Asia of the Karasuk type were recovered at Kuilug-Khem I. And a new type of Hun-Sarmatian burial was discovered that is reminiscent in some ways of the famous Noin-Ula tombs of Mongolia. A special section in 1966 devoted its efforts to the location and study of petroglyphs. Some of those found are stylistically similar to the distinctive art of the Okunevo culture of the Minusinsk Basin. The study of petroglyphs, dating from the Bronze Age onward, continued in 1967. In the same season additional Stone Age materials were found exposed at 28 points. Some of these are considered to be of late Palaeolithic age, but in all cases the finds are scanty and there is little actual basis for dating. Cemetery excavation continued to be the main occupation of the expedition, but an ancient Uigur fortified town of the 8th-9th centuries A.D. (Bashyn-Alak) also received attention {Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1965 Goda : 22-32; Arkheologi- cheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda : 124-134; Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 159-161, 169-176). Perhaps the richest archaeological area in Siberia, the Minusinsk Basin and the valley of the Middle Yenisei north to Krasnoyarsk, will be extensively inundated by the reservoir of the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric project. Nineteen sixty-three marked the fourth season of salvage activity here by the large Krasnoyarsk Expedi- tion of the Institute of Archaeology directed by M. P. Griaznov. Most of the archaeological remains in the area are kurgāns and other metal age burials, and the</page><page sequence="3">Chard: Northeast Asia 3 bulk of the work was naturally devoted to these, but sites of all periods were surveyed and a number excavated, from the Upper Palaeolithic to the time of the Kyrgyz state, plus old Khakass burials of the 18th century. Excavations were carried out in five stratified Upper Palaeolithic settlements, the most interesting find being a bison scapula pierced by a bone point, revealing hunting techniques of the time. Extensive excavations in the Biriusa Neolithic settlement provided the first good information on the distinctive features of the Yenisei Neolithic, which include survivals of Palaeolithic technology. The excavator equates the site with the Serovo stage of the Baikal area. The pottery displays traits characteristic of both Cis-Baikal and the Urals-Kama region. (Prior to this, the Neolithic of this important part of Siberia was known only from scattered finds of uncertain provenience.) Five Afanasievo cemeteries yielded 77 burials. A major success was the demonstration of the Okunevo culture (130 burials) as a new and distinct archaeological culture of the early metal period, with much stone still in use and a rich and distinctive art style. In general, the resources of the expedition made possible for the first time the complete excavation of metal age cemeteries, providing valuable demographic information. Three settlements and 75 burials of the Andronovo period and 253 Karasuk burials (including 132 at the type site) were uncovered. Another major achievement was the study of a settlement and six cemeteries of late Karasuk age (10th-8th centuries b.c.) - to which the name Kammenyi Log stage was given - including the first Bronze Age pit house to be examined on the Yenisei. The population was sedentary and practiced a farming-herding economy. (Remains of this type had previously been considered to represent a separate ethnic group contemporary with Karasuk and had been termed the Lugavskoi or Beiskoi culture.) The most abundant archaeological remains in the area are those of the Minusinsk Kurgan or Tagar culture (7th-3rd centuries b.c.), which was shown to undergo continuous cultural development throughout this time so that the recognized archaeological stages (Bainovo, Podgornovo, Saragash) proved to be merely arbitrary divisions. Some 300 burials were opened. For the first time examples of the so-called collective burials of the final stage were excavated meticulously, showing that these kurgāns were definitely used for successive burials over a period of time. Also examined were two settlements containing both aboveground and pit houses, and a metallurgical workshop of this same stage. Three settlements of the succeeding Tashtyk period were investigated; the uniformity of the pottery did not reflect the hypothetical subdivisions into which the period has been divided (Kratkie Soobshcheniia Institūta Arkheologii 100: 62-71). By 1966 a total of 800 sq. m had been uncovered at the Palaeolithic site of Kokorevo I (Zabochka). The six horizons seem to represent relatively brief occupa- tions and are not thought to be separated by any great lapse of time. Some horizons are rich in remains ; in others they are scanty. Smaller-scale excavations were carried out in several other late Palaeolithic sites in 1966-67, including Tashtyk I (three horizons) and Tashtyk II. Both seem culturally related to Afontova Gora. A large Neolithic site, buried 125-160 cm from the surface and stretching 400 m along the Yenisei by the mouth of the Syda River near Uniuk, was investigated. It contained remains of aboveground dwellings and pottery with pit-comb and stab-and-drag decoration. Large-scale excavation of metal age cemeteries of all periods continued through 1967 (. Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1965 Goda : 5-21;</page><page sequence="4">4 Asian Perspectives , xiv, 1971 Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda : 135-147; Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 146-151, 161-162, 177-182). Large areas of Siberia have remained little known archaeologically. Some of these have now begun to be explored for the first time. In 1963-64 a reconnaissance was carried out by G. I. Andreev along the middle and lower course of the Podkammenaia Tunguska River, one of the major tributaries of the Yenisei. The closest cultural affinities of the materials collected proved to be with such middle Angara sites as Chadobets, but there were also evident parallels with Cis-Baikal, the Lena valley, and western Siberia. Another 160 km of the riverbank was surveyed in 1966, at which time a considerable number of sites were located. And in 1967 examination of the locality around the confluence with the Yenisei revealed sites ascribed to the second half of the first millennium B.c. and to the early and later Iron Age. The Lower Tunguska River was also an object of attention beginning in 1965, when survey and surface collecting was carried out along a 300 km stretch and especially in the vicinity of Tura, the center of the Evenki National District. Here many sites were located that are of different ages, but which are thought to fall within the confines of the second millennium b.c. In 1966 the first actual excavation was begun at a three-level site at Tura containing hearths and different lithic complexes; the lowest level is nonceramic. This work continued in 1967. In the same area excava- tions were also begun in a single-component site culturally quite similar to the upper level of the former (. Kratkie Soobshcheniia Institūta Arkheologii 101: 94-98; Andreev and Fomin 1966; Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda : 161-162; Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 152-153). Another "blank spot," the Taimyr Peninsula, the northernmost portion of Siberia, received its first archaeological exploration in 1967 when a survey of the eastern part revealed 33 sites. The course of cultural development in this desolate tundra zone seems to parallel that of the taiga, and includes a nonceramic core and blade site at a depth of 1 .3 m as well as a ceramic site yielding examples of hair temper and textile impressions. Complexes with prismatic cores, triangular points, and linear stamped pottery resemble the site of Buolkalaakh on the Olenek River, assigned to the late Bronze or early Iron Age. The pottery in other sites shows parallels with the Baikal region. Some localities revealed traces of ironworking. Another area visited in 1967 was the Yamal Peninsula, the first archaeological work here since Chernetsov's pioneer effort in the 1920s, and the first discovery of stone tools, in sites ascribed to the Bronze Age (second millennium b.c.) {Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 147-149, 153-155). On the upper Angara River, one of the classical archaeological areas of Siberia, 1963-64 saw the conclusion of eight years' work at the important Usť-Belaia site by Irkutsk University, the Irkutsk Provincial Museum, and (initially) a geological- palaeontological expedition from the Academy of Sciences. In place of the former five Mesolithic levels underlying metal age and Neolithic (reported as of 1962), more extensive investigation had now revealed thirteen, all separated (under optimum conditions, in certain areas) by sterile layers 5-30 cm thick. These levels are not evident in all parts of the site, or else they run together. The lower twelve lie in the alluvium of the first terrace of the Belaia River, up to 2.5 m under the present surface. The period of existence of a Mesolithic settlement at this place corresponds to the whole time of the accumulation of the floodplain alluvium of the first terrace</page><page sequence="5">Chard: Northeast Asia 5 and the beginning of the development of the covering deposits on its surface. This is considered to represent no more than 3000 years. Since the fauna is purely Holocene in character, the first occupation of the site is thought to be no older than the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary ; yet a sample of bone from the upper Mesolithic levels (III-IV) has a radiocarbon date of 8960 ± 60 (GIN-96). The relative continuity of occupation here is evident. Mesolithic remains have been found over an area of more than 12,000 sq. m, suggesting the areal extent of the site. Through 1964, more than 900 sq. m of the Mesolithic levels had been excavated. The settlement pattern remained the same through time: a line of temporary hearths along the riverbank. Pits, presumably for storage, are a feature not hitherto found in Angara Mesolithic sites. Filled with rubbish, including dog coprolites, they were all dug from levels XIII-I, the later of two main stages in the history of occupation. The 46 hearths are all very similar and with rare exceptions lack any stone lining. There is technological unity throughout all these levels. Of the 36,440 recorded finds, 57% represents flint débitage, 31% faunai remains, and 12% artifacts. Of the identified bones, 56% are roe deer; fish comprise 5%, moose and maral 3%, birds 1%. Of the flint artifacts, 65% are prismatic blades (microblades, macro- blades), irregular blades and artifacts made from blades, and 20% (797) are cores. There is a gradual evolution toward typically Neolithic forms; for instance, few prismatic cores occur in the lower levels, and the first typical Neolithic core drills appear in the topmost Mesolithic level. The inventory includes 72 burins (the 44 of Verkholenskaia type are all from the later stage of the site), 24 small skreblo, 22 chopperlike or adzlike pebble tools, 6 polished slate tools and a very primitive nephrite adz. A bifacial foliate arrowpoint in level XV and 4 other arrowpoints (mostly from later levels) all precede blade arrowpoints. The 120 bone artifacts include 7 slotted tools, 6 fishhooks, 8 harpoons, 3 leister prongs, a birdbone needlecase, etc. There are 197 ornaments of agamatolite, slate, bone, and mother of pearl. In the excavator's opinion, the complex is typically Mesolithic in that old forms still persist and Neolithic forms are primitive and just taking shape, so to speak (Medvedev 1967). In 1967 a still older level was discovered (XVI), containing two hearths, many fish remains, and a lithic complex that included some traits absent in later levels. Of particular interest was the find of a cult burial of a dog in a storage pit considered to date earlier than 9000 years ago. This is by far the oldest dog burial in the Angara region (or perhaps anywhere). The deceased was adorned with a necklace of red deer canines and was surrounded by wild cattle bones. The Irkutsk University party also investigated the similar but badly eroded site of Uliakha 10 km distant which proved to comprise three late Mesolithic horizons similar to levels XIII-I at Usť-Belaia. The presence of cores with beveled platform (Okladnikov's "epilevallois type") is reported ( Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 163). Elsewhere on the upper Angara, a survey of Mesolithic sites for future work was carried out by Irkutsk University in 1966, covering 150 km of the river below Irkutsk. Sites of the "Badai group" (e.g., Cheremushnik, Badai) were examined; these are geologically post-Pleistocene and typologically equivalent to levels XV-XIV at Usť-Belaia. New sites discovered included Sosnovyi Bor, and Kamenka I-V near the mouth of the Ida River. The latter are stratigraphically similar to the Badai group, but show cultural similarities to Verkholenskaia Gora. In 1967,</page><page sequence="6">6 Asian Perspectives , xiv, 1971 excavations were begun at the very promising stratified site of Sosnovyi Bor on the Belaia, revealing five cultural horizons in clear stratigraphie conditions. Level I is mixed Neolithic-Bronze Age; II is late Mesolithic; III, early Mesolithic; IV and V are Palaeolithic. The lowest level, which appears to lie in the alluvium of the third terrace, may be of considerable antiquity. This is a potentially important site, but the cultural remains recovered so far are still inadequate for any definite conclusions (Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda : 166-167; Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 162-164). From 1963 to 1965 new investigations were undertaken at the famous site of Verkholenskaia Gora by Irkutsk University and the Irkutsk Provincial Museum in order to clarify uncertainties in the geological and stratigraphie interpretations set forth in Medvedev's restudy of 1959, which was carried out upslope from Petri's original site. (Medvedev had concluded that the site represented only a single component.) This time excavations were made directly adjoining Petri's. They revealed three clear horizons: I, which is disturbed, contains remains from all levels plus Iron Age; II is Mesolithic, and although subjected to some mixing and movement contains no later materials; III is represented by three hearths, two slab-lined, situated at the bottom of cracks and fissures that evidently had served as shelters. Finds in level III included amorphous cores, lateral burins of Verk- holenskaia type (considered similar to the Araya burins of preceramic Japan), skreblo, choppers, five kinds of knives, harpoons of the previously known type (or variations of this) - also a new type recalling Glazkovo (early Bronze Age), a piece of ostrich egg shell, and many fish remains. Level II showed no sharp differences culturally, although some new modifications and types appear. The amorphous cores are replaced by definite forms: wedge-shaped (including Gobi), conical microcores, and crude prismatic cores. There are fragments of possible bifacial points. The inventory of level I is mostly similar to the preceding, with some new types, including a bifacial (but not foliate) point and a fragment of a possible base of one. The investigators, taking into consideration all lines of evidence, assign an age of 11,000-10,000 years to level III and 10,000-9000 to level II. In 1966 another excavation was carried out on the summit of the mountain 500 m from the original dig; this is labelled Verkholenskaia Gora II. Finds include bifacially retouched knives of ulo type, a pebble chopper, pebble core, wedge-shaped and prismatic cores, and lateral burins of Verkholenskaia type (Aksenov 1966 b; Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda: 165). Another well-known Palaeolithic site on the Angara, Krasnyi IAr, was also reinvestigated by Irkutsk University in 1964-65 just prior to its disappearance beneath the rising waters of the Bratsk Reservoir. 613 sq. m were excavated to a depth of 4 to 6 m, revealing four new horizons underlying the three known pre- viously. Geological studies were also carried out. Level VI contained six hearths, a rhinoceros bone, 16 Gobi cores, microblades, large blades, and artifacts made from them (7 burins, including lateral, and knives), a chopper, and a skreblo . (Gobi cores, lateral burins and knives on prismatic blades are all absent in the upper levels.) Almost all finds in the lowest level (VII) were associated with three hearths. Of interest are beads made of ostrich egg shell, and microblades. On the basis of the earlier excavation of the upper levels, Abramova had argued that Krasnyi IAr represented a cultural successor of Mal'ta. The present excavators point out that</page><page sequence="7">Chard: Northeast Asia 7 the new lower levels have nothing in common with Mal'ta and could not be descended from it, although geologically they are probably somewhat younger. They believe that the site reflects a separate cultural tradition pointing toward Trans-Baikal, the nearest source of ostrich egg shell, and an area where Gobi cores and lateral burins are also typical (Medvedev 19666). In 1963 the first reconnaissance of the northern shore of Lake Baikal was carried out by the Irkutsk Provincial Museum and Irkutsk University; the work was continued in 1965. In all, 27 sites were located. Surface collections reveal close relationships with Yakutia as well as with the Angara area (Svinin 1966). Also in 1963 two earlier sites were reported by L. P. Khlobystin from the northwestern shore: Ludarskaia I, with an Iron Age level underlain by a stratigraphically distinct horizon which he considers pre-Neolithic (a nonceramic blade industry with no arrowpoints, one wedge-shaped core, many burins including polyhedral forms, and one harpoon but no other fishing equipment); and Ludarskaia III, consisting of five stone artifacts from the surface which he believes to be of terminal Palaeolithic type. Khlobystin also revisited the famous Ulan Khada site and confirmed the distinctive nature of Petri's lowest (XI) level, about which doubts were widely held. He believes that the locality had been abandoned after this initial early settlement and was only later reoccupied in Serovo times ( Materialy i Issledovaniia po Arkheologii SSSR 131: 252-279; Kratkie Soobshcheniia Institūta Arkheologii 97: 25-32). In Trans-Baikal, an interesting Palaeolithic site (Ikaral) was discovered by a geologist in 1964 in the Onon River valley, Chita Province. It contained a hearth and stone artifacts (burins, blades, microblades, and wedge-shaped microcores) associated with bones of woolly rhinoceros (Shamsutdinov 1966). Also in the Onon valley, the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences in 1965-66 excavated at the Neolithic settlement of Chindant. The settlement lies buried at a depth of 6-8 m, an unusual stratigraphie situation in this part of Siberia. The finds are concentrated around hearths, and the evidence suggests a temporary settlement of a hunting group with impermanent structures. The lithic technology is of the small-tool core and blade type, showing many parallels with Mongolia, but there are also big skreblo made of pebbles reminiscent of the Gromatukha culture on the Middle Amur. The pottery is of the usual Trans-Baikal type. In the same area, stratigraphically earlier than the Neolithic remains, were discovered traces of Palaeolithic occupation associated with woolly rhinoceros ( Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda : 171-172). Mongolia has continued to be an active area of fieldwork. In 1964 the Soviet- Mongolian Expedition, jointly sponsored by the Academies of Sciences of the two countries and led by A. P. Okladnikov, carried out an extensive survey of the Tola valley in the region of Ulan-Bator, discovering a number of Palaeolithic localities (one - Khudzhir-Bulun - a stratified site), a Mesolithic site, and Bronze Age petroglyphs. This was followed by a survey along the route from Ulan-Bator to Karakorum, which located materials of Palaeolithic type, studied the Pleistocene geology of the area, and discovered several Neolithic sites (including Lun-Somon, with small tools and food-grinding equipment). Surveys were also carried out along the Orkhon River in the vicinity of Karakorum. Excavations were then resumed at the important Palaeolithic site of Moil'tyn-am, where an additional 44 sq. m were</page><page sequence="8">8 Asian Perspectives 9 xiv, 1971 uncovered, making a total of 130 to date. Geological and geomorphological studies of the site and vicinity were also made. In 1966 western Mongolia and the Mongolian Altai, hitherto archaeologically unknown, were surveyed by the expedition. Palaeolithic workshops were discovered in the region of Baian-Urgi, in which older and younger components were identified on the basis of typology and weathering (the oldest being labeled "Lower Palaeolithic"). Large collections were made from similar sites 30 km southeast of Kobdo. In the Mankhan-somon area apparently Palaeolithic paintings were discovered in Khoit Tsinker cave. Judging from the number of sites of all periods observed everywhere along the route, it is evident that western Mongolia has been well populated from early times. Following this survey, studies were carried out in the Tola valley near Ulan- Bator to elucidate the stratigraphy of the Palaeolithic remains in the area. Attention turned to eastern Mongolia in 1967. Sites believed to be Neolithic were investigated, including burials and (at Tamtsag-Bulag) the first Neolithic (or possibly early Bronze Age) dwelling to be excavated in Mongolia, which proved to be a pit house reminiscent of those of the Amur or Maritime Territory. Structures of this type have not been found before either in Mongolia or in adjacent Trans-Baikal. Also investigated was a Mesolithic site at Mt. Khereul on the Khalkin-Gol River containing a complex described as very similar to Tadusha and preceramic Japan, especially with respect to cores, blades, core scrapers, and ski spalls (Okladnikov 1967, Okladnikov and Larichev 1967, Okladnikov and Troitskii 1967). A party from the Irkutsk Provincial Museum surveyed the upper Lena between the Anga and Tira Rivers, locating 15 sites, three of which lacked pottery. Excava- tions were then carried out at the previously known Makarovo site, uncovering 75 sq. m. A Mesolithic dwelling with cultural remains said to resemble Verk- holenskaia Gora was found underneath Iron Age, Bronze Age, and Neolithic horizons {Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda: 169-170). The Aldan River valley has in recent years been the scene of active fieldwork by IU. A. Mochanov of the Yakutsk branch of the Academy of Sciences, the results of which have contributed very significantly to our understanding of Siberian prehistory. In 1963 he discovered and excavated the Ikhine site at lat. 63° N, the first indubitable Pleistocene site to be found in Yakutia. The fauna includes mammoth, Bison priscus, and a small type of horse. Although 74.5 sq. m were uncovered, cultural remains were scanty, a fine Gobi core being the most diagnostic. Closest parallels are seen with Krasnyi I Ar (levels VI-VII) and Ikaral in Trans- Baikal. In 1965 seven sites of the "Holocene Palaeolithic" (Sumnagin culture) were examined - all temporary camps with stone hearths around which tools, bones of Holocene animals, and fish remains are concentrated. The materials from all the sites are quite uniform and represent a single distinctive complex which in Mochanov's opinion resembles such late Palaeolithic sites as Afontova Gora, Tashtyk, Krasnyi IAr, Fediaevo, Verkholenskaia Gora, and Oshurkovo. The lithic industry includes wedge-shaped and prismatic cores, lamelles and flakes, angle and lateral burins, and end scrapers, but not a single example of bifacial technique. There are also chopping tools, skreblo and adzes, and pebble net sinkers. On the majority of sites this complex is overlain by an Early Neolithic horizon with no</page><page sequence="9">Chard: Northeast Asia 9 indication of a significant time gap (Mochanov 1966a, 19666 ; SovetskaiaArkheologiia 1968, 4: 244-248). A study of four stratified Neolithic sites on the Aldan in 1964 plus five other single-component sites made possible a division of the Neolithic of the area into three stages and the characterization of each stage. This is the first stratigraphically- based periodization of the ceramic Neolithic in interior Siberia and has subsequently been expanded to apply to most of the rest of Yakutia (Lena basin), where the pre- viously known Neolithic sites contained mixed materials. It also has significance for a far wider area in view of the general lack of well-dated evidence elsewhere. The Early Neolithic is characterized by pottery hand-molded with the aid of a net or mat, with resultant impressions on the outer surface. The vessels are of the usual egg-shaped forest form with a row of perforations around the rim. In many cases the lip is decorated with oblique incisions, sometimes executed with a dentate stamp. A radiocarbon date of 5975=1=70 b.p. provides the first index of the time depth of pottery in the forest zone of northern Asia, and substantially exceeds the maximum age hypothesized by many leading authorities. Stone tools are made mostly from lamelles taken from prismatic or wedge-shaped cores, and include burins, blade arrowpoints, bifacial stemmed arrowpoints, and various types of knives and scrapers. There are also big unifacial skreblo of Palaeolithic type, adz-like and chisel-like tools, and bone harpoons. The excavator sees many parallels with early Angara sites and with preceramic materials in Hokkaido. He is of the opinion that this is essentially a Mesolithic complex plus pottery (Mochanov 1966c). The Middle Neolithic ("Berkachi culture") is characterized by cord-wrapped paddle-impressed pottery, some with rims thickened by appliqué and decorated with designs made by a dentate stamp or dentate spatula, the remainder with perforations often supplemented with horizontal incised lines. It is believed to fall in the third millennium b.c. The majority of the earlier stone and bone tool types survive, but the stone inventory is greatly enriched by new forms borrowed from here and there all over northeastern Asia (nowhere else do they occur as a complex). The source of the new technique of pottery manufacture is also obscure ; nowhere else in Siberia does it occur so abundantly (Mochanov 1967c). The Late Neolithic ("Ymyiakhtakh culture") features check-stamped pottery, often with hair temper; the commonest decoration is rim perforation and incised zigzags. There is a marked decrease in the quantity of tools made on blades, flakes being the common material. The culture is ascribed to the second millennium b.c. (Mochanov 1967 b). Extensive reconnaissance was carried out in Yakutia in the summer of 1967. The Lena was examined from the Kirenga River to the Niua, with finds of Palaeolithic and Neolithic-type materials. New studies were carried out at Chastino. A survey of the Olenek River found some 30 new sites. The valley of the Maia (the right tributary of the Aldan) proved to belong culturally to the Aldan-Lena sphere, which here comes within a short distance of the Sea of Okhotsk. Many sites were located of all Neolithic stages as well as of Bronze and early Iron Ages. The most exciting discovery was made during a further reconnaissance on the middle Aldan: a Palaeolithic cave near the mouth of the Diuktai River with deposits 1.5 to 2.5 m deep containing mammoth and other Pleistocene fauna associated with skreblo , massive archaic-looking burins, and bifacial pressure-flaked projectile</page><page sequence="10">io Asian Perspectives , xiv, 1971 points and knives. This is the first occurrence of such points in Siberia in an indubitable Pleistocene context. The cave floor is 75 sq. m in extent, of which 10 were excavated in 1967. Further work is scheduled. Charcoal for dating purposes is present. The first real archaeological investigation of the region of the Middle Amur valley has been carried out since 1961 by the Far Eastern Archaeological Expedition of the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences under the direction of A. P. Okladnikov - initially as salvage work in the future Zeia Reservoir area. From 1961 through 1965 over 50 Stone Age sites were investigated, including the finds of possible human artifacts in very early deposits at Filomoshki. Most fully excavated were the settlements at Novopetrovka (2000 sq. m), Osino Lake near Voikovo, Sergeevka and Gromatukha. As a result, four Neolithic cultures have been identified in the region: the Novopetrovka blade culture; the Gromatukha; Osino Lake; and (intrusive) Lower Amur cultures. However, their relative chronological position remains to be demonstrated. Three field seasons at the Novopetrovka site uncovered ten pit houses and a large part of the intervening areas. The stone industry is a core and blade technology analogous to that at Tadusha in the Maritime Territory, with the addition of such Neolithic elements as polished adzes, abraders, and fiat-bottomed pottery decorated with notched appliqué. On typological grounds the Novopetrovka blade culture is regarded as early; the pottery may be the oldest in the Soviet Far East. A different economic and settlement pattern is revealed in the Sergeevka and Gromatukha sites (Gromatukha culture). Here there are no pit houses, only hearths suggestive of impermanent aboveground structures. The stone industry, also different, is characterized both by a microblade technology and by large unifacial skreblo- like and adz-like implements made from pebbles which the excavators delight in likening to Hoabinhian. There are also bifacial pressure-flaked foliate arrowpoints and large bifacial knife-daggers, the latter made from flakes. The pottery typically is covered with impressions of a wooden paddle wrapped with coarse grasses or coarse threads made of grass. Some sherds are decorated with comb-punctate, stab-and-drag, or combinations of linear incision; dentate roller and notched appliqué have also been reported. There is general agreement that the culture is intrusive in the area, but whether from Yakutia to the north or from the lower Amur is a matter of dispute. The Osino Lake culture is again different. It has semisubterranean houses, a farming economy (evidenced by grains of millet as well as food grinding equipment), and a stone technology lacking blade cores or lamelles (flakes from nodules provided the material for tools). The pottery, reminiscent of the earliest, is notched appliqué and the vessels are flat-bottomed. The intrusive sites of Lower Amur Neolithic type have pit houses, a large amount of fishing equipment, pottery of familiar Lower Amur types, and equipment for digging and food-grinding that has suggested farming. The expedition has also excavated later sites: an early Iron Age fortified site at Kokui near the Blagoveshchensk airport; a settlement of the same period at UriF Lake below that city; another at Pol'tso near Kukelevo; and a hunting-fishing settlement at the mouth of the Ango River in the Zeia valley that seems Neolithic except for one bronze object.</page><page sequence="11">Chard: Northeast Asia n The Urir Lake site is a large settlement with a row of big semisubterranean houses. Many stone tools were in use, but the probable farming equipment includes some made of iron. The pottery is flat-bottomed and decorated with incisions and notched appliqué. The Pol'tso site, on which work is continuing, represents a later stage of the Uřiť Lake culture. Farming is evidently the main economic base, with remains of millet in the large jars used for grain storage. There is a wide variety of iron objects, and stone tools are rare. The site has yielded a radiocarbon date of 980±80 b.C. Mohe settlements with semisubterranean houses as well as cemeteries have also been investigated, dating from early in the Christian era, as well as medieval pit house settlements of the 8th-9th centures and 1 1th- 13th century villages of large houses (over 100 sq. m) with heating flues. Fortified sites of the Daurian period (15th-17th centuries) bring the record to historic times (Derevianko 19666; Okladnikov 1966č; Okladnikov and Derevianko 1966; Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda : 173-175; Sovetskaia Arkheologiia 1965, 3: 114-123). The first extensive program of archaeological work on the Lower Amur was also carried out by the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences beginning in 1961. A number of sites (some stratified) were investigated at Kondon in the Komsomol'sk district in 1961-63, including a Neolithic settlement of large semisubterranean houses 100 sq. m or more in size. Here were found many flint prismatic cores and lamelles, polished and partly chipped axes and adzes, nephrite beads, flat-bottomed pottery often decorated with rich designs, and a unique female portrait figurine. Another site reflected the subsequent intrusion of an alien Neolithic group with round-bottomed pottery decorated in Cis-Baikal style. Bronze Age culture developed here in the first millennium b.c., and an Iron Age culture very similar to that of the Middle Amur took over in the 6th-3rd centuries b.c. Mohe culture is represented in sites of the first centuries A.D., and there are remains of subsequent medieval occupation. In 1965-66 excavations were carried out at the stratified Voznesenovka site at the mouth of the Khungari River. Three Neolithic levels here, stratigraphically distinct, enable periodization of the Lower Amur Neolithic for the first time. These levels are overlain by early Iron Age and Mohe horizons. The early Neolithic is characterized by small tools and pottery of truncated conical form with horizontal bands of vertical dentate stamps ("zoned dentate"). Another ware, occasionally with a polished bright red surface, is richly stamped with triangular designs sometimes seeming to be executed by a cord technique, perhaps a cord-wrapped stick. Closest analogies to this horizon are found in the single-component Malyshevo site below Khabarovsk. The term "Malyshevo culture stage" is proposed. The middle Neolithic level is characterized by pottery with meander design or the "Amur woven" decoration, and white nephrite rings. Closest analogies are found at Kondon. The final Neolithic level has pottery decorated with vertical zigzags executed by a comb-punctate roulette technique or, less often, with spiral ornament. There are also plain vessels with narrow necks. Slate arrowpoints with notched bases and slate knife blades are also characteristic, as are big tools made of split pebbles. The type site for this complex is Suchu Island, studied earlier, which is considered to date about 2500 b.c. {Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1966 Goda: 175-178; Věstník Akademii Nauk SSSR 34(6): 71-78).</page><page sequence="12">12 Asian Perspectives , xiv, 1971 In the Maritime Territory, A. P. Okladnikov in 1963 carried out the first systematic excavations at the often-discussed Tadusha site near Ustinovka village, 30 km upstream on the Tadusha River from the Sea of Japan. 60 sq. m were uncovered, revealing a single-component site with a unified and distinctive technological complex, evidently a workshop for the production of blanks of volcanic tuff for subsequent fabrication into tools. No industrial or living complexes were noted. Blanks for Gobi cores are a numerous category. Other distinctive core types are classified as "epilevallois." Owing to the absence of Neolithic traits and the dissimilarity to the Palaeolithic industry of the region, Tadusha is judged to fall in between and is classified as "Mesolithic" in this sense. Closest parallels at the time were seen with preceramic Japan. It should be noted that the laurel leaf points reported by the geologist Petrun, the original discoverer of the site, now appear to have come from near the surface in another area and are evidently not a part of the Tadusha complex (Okladnikov 1966a). In 1966-67 one of a group of sites along the lower Maikhe River in the southern Maritime Territory, Maikhe I, was completely excavated, over 2000 sq. m being uncovered. The site has four levels: two Early Iron Age cultures (Chapigou and Sidemi); Neolithic and Mesolithic. The Sidemi culture occupation was a farming- fishing settlement of 18 semisubterranean houses including two large community structures. Village pattern, house construction and domestic life could all be studied, supplemented by data from the similar horizon at Maikhe II, a very large site of which 500 sq. m has been uncovered. Maikhe I is the second site of this culture to be completely excavated, the other being Peschanyi near Vladivostok. The Maikhe settlements are regarded as a regional variant of the typical Sidemi or Shell Mound culture of the Vladivostok area. The uppermost (Chapigou culture) level at Maikhe I was a village of nine houses, and is the only settlement of this culture to be fully excavated. The Chapigou culture arose in the interior of the southern Maritime Territory (Lake Khanka) contemporary with the Sidemi culture on the coast, and in its later stages spread to the coast and replaced the latter. The earliest Chapigou site is radiocarbon dated at 1060±80 b.c.; this is considered to reflect the first appearance of iron in the Maritime Territory, well in advance of the traditional Han Dynasty date in China. (Bronze in this same general area is dated to 2200±60 b.c. at the Kirovskoe site.) The Neolithic horizon at Maikhe I contains 25 pit houses. Hoes and grinding equipment suggest farming. The underlying Mesolithic horizon is described as stratigraphically very distinct. It contains Gobi cores, microblades, "epilevallois" cores, lamelles, and transverse burins of Verkholenskaia or "Araya" type. Many parallels are seen with preceramic Japan ( Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 155-157). The most sensational development in 1967, however, was the discovery of artifacts in the Geographical Society Cave near the port of Nakhodka associated with an early form of mammoth. An age of 25,000-30,000 years has been suggested on this basis. The artifacts include a Levallois core and pebbles treated with side blows. In the Magadan area in 1964 R. S. Vasil'evskii carried out excavations in an Ancient Koryak pit house settlement at Sredniaia Bay consisting of 15 round houses 18-29 m in diameter. The largest one was excavated. Evidence suggested that iron was in use for piercing and cutting the edges of implements, although no actual iron</page><page sequence="13">Chard: Northeast Asia 13 was found. The house also contained bronze Chinese coins, not yet identified. At Cape Trex Braťev three crevice burials out of eight were opened. There were no cultural materials and the ethnic affinities of the people are still undetermined. The matter has remained a mystery since the first discovery of the site in 1955. One of the most important sites ever discovered in Siberia is the stratified locality on Ushki Lake adjoining the Kamchatka River in central Kamchatka. In 1961-62 five levels separated by volcanic ash falls were identified ; four were considered to be Neolithic, and the lowest to date from the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. The site provides a chronological-cultural yardstick for much of northeastern Siberia and the associated pollen profile furnishes an integrated vegetation-climatic history as well {Arctic Anthropology 3(1): 10-25). In 1964, low water levels enabled testing of deeper levels underlying level V (dated at 10,360 b.p.), resulting in the discovery of four new horizons (Va, VI, VII, VIII), all of Pleistocene age with pollen reflecting a vegetation cover of stony tundra. The lowest level contains only charcoal. Hearths are present in the other three horizons, and VII, in addition to 12 hearths, contains a burial from which the human remains had almost completely decomposed owing to ground water. However, the grave contained red ocher, artifacts, pendants, and a great many stone beads which had evidently been sewn onto the costume of the deceased. Level VII, which has been excavated over 180 sq. m at one locality, is considered to represent an early stage of the Kamchatka Palaeolithic; it yielded arrowpoints of a different type from the foliates of overlying horizons. A date of 14,300=b200 was subsequently obtained on charcoal, which is consistent with other evidence. Levels V, Va and VI represent a culturally different later stage of the Palaeolithic {Arctic Anthropology 5(1) : 191-212). In following years these levels were excavated at two additional localities of the Ushki site, revealing not only more hearths but seven semisubterranean houses of rectangular, round, or oval shape, 12 to 20 sq. m in size. The stone industry includes Gobi cores, ski spalls, and bifacial foliate arrowpoints; burins are very rare and blade production is negligible. The complex has no exact parallels elsewhere, but finds its closest analogies in Kokorevo III on the Yenisei and Fediaevo on the Angara; there are also some links to preceramic Japan. A terminal Pleistocene age is indicated by both cultural and pollen data, consistent with the radiocarbon date of 10,360 b.p. for level V. The determination of 21,100±900 (GIN-186) for a sample from level VI is obviously erroneous and must be disregarded. There is no cultural continuity to the later levels of the site where wedge-shaped are replaced by prismatic cores, blade technology predominates, and arrowpoints are completely different. The year 1965 saw the termination of nine years' archaeological fieldwork by the Institute of Ethnography at East Cape on Bering Strait, devoted primarily to the excavation of the remarkable prehistoric Eskimo cemeteries at Uelen and at Ekven 35 km to the south. The Uelen cemetery, comprising 76 burials, was completely excavated; at Ekven, 152 burials have been opened. Both cemeteries were used over many centuries. Finds are predominantly of Old Bering Sea type, plus Okvik (now known to be contemporary with and closely related to late Old Bering Sea), Birnirk, and Punuk. The latter two cultures are demonstrated to be contemporary, representing two different regional economic specializations developing out of a late OBS-Okvik base.</page><page sequence="14">14 Asian Perspectives , xiv, 1971 In addition to the largest sample of an extinct Eskimo population yet recovered, the excavations yielded no less than 617 toggle harpoon heads which have been subjected to intensive typological analysis. This has resulted in a hypothesis that toggle harpoons have a dual ancestry, in the composite slotted spears and knives of the late Palaeolithic tradition, and in barbed leister prongs. A great quantity of art objects were also recovered, including the first wooden mask from OBS times. Interpretation of finds, burial practices, and settlement patterns was constantly aided by reference to folklore and information from Eskimo informants participating in the excavations (Arutiunov and Sergeev 1966 ; Sergeev 1966a ; Arctic Anthropology 5(1): 72-75). The first petroglyphs to be found in the tundra zone or anywhere in northeastern Siberia were studied in 1967 by N. N. Dikov on the PegtymeP River 50-60 km from the coast of the Chukchi Peninsula. They are situated on cliffs along a 400 m stretch, and depict scenes of reindeer hunting, whale hunting, and anthropomorphic figures evidently of cult significance ( Arkheologicheskie Otkrytiia 1967 Goda: 157-159).

Report on 1959 excavation of a stratified settlement near the Amur Sanatarium. Evidence of four occupations: Neolithic, Late Bronze-Early Iron, late Medieval, and 17th century Nanai (Gold). An area of 625 sq. m was uncovered. No undisturbed Neolithic horizon was located, but there were scattered finds of Neolithic-type material including pottery of Tetiukhe "woven" type indicating an early occupation destroyed by later settlements. Most of the cultural deposit belongs to level 2, and the bulk of the report is devoted to this. The settlement comprised a row of pit houses. There is a brief account of the Nanai house in level 4. The late Medieval occupation was a Jurchen settlement.</page><page sequence="24">24 Asian Perspectives , xiv, 1971 1964 Oleri zolotye roga [The deer with golden antlers]. Moscow.

Outline paintings in shades of red on walls of Khoit-Tsenker cave, 25 km southwest of Mankhan-Somon, western Mongolia, discovered by the 1966 Soviet-Mongolian Expedi- tion. The majority are in the farthest depths in semi-darkness. In their location and style they differ from all other known rock art of Mongolia and Siberia. Some parallels are noted from Soviet Central Asia. The author sees stylistic kinship to Aurignacian art. He identifies two figures as Elephus namadicus and three as ostriches, and feels that the major part of the pictures belong to the Palaeolithic. (There are abundant Palaeolithic remains in the area.) In the author's opinion this is beyond question the oldest art site in this part of Asia. Okladnikov, A. P., and O. M.

After briefly sketching the earlier Neolithic period on the north coast of the Sea of Okhotsk, the author is concerned with the development and relationships of the Ancient Koryak culture, the first sea hunting economy in the area, regarded as representing the direct ancestors of the modern Koryak. Five stages of development are identified, covering the span from A.D. 500 through the 17th century. Attention is also given to ecological aspects. (See note under 1966a above.) Verkhnii Pleistotsen.

Identical pottery is found in early Mohe sites on the Middle Amur, and close analogies in Trans-Baikal (burials found in 1958 near Oloviannaia Station and dated by Okladnikov to the first centuries A.D.).
