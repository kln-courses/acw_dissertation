The Quest For Fundamentals E VERY man is at heart a fundamentalist. The quest for fundamentals is as natural as it is inevitable. Especially is it true at a time of political, social and religious up- heaval. Today we live in the midst of a period fraught with infinite perils and possibilities. Political organizations and ideals that have both fortified and handicapped us have been thrown into the discard. Long accepted social theories have suddenly been rejected, and new ones are being adopted. Many of the moral standards of our fathers are being set aside in theory, as well as in practice. The rising generation has no fear and little respect for elders. The elders, recognizing what a wreck they have made of civilization, question their own infallibility. Religious dogmas long regarded as the corner- stones of religion and the church are being dis- proved or supplanted by the discoveries of modern science. All theologies suddenly seem sadly out of date. Meantime the brilliant discoveries of scien- tists are changing and expanding our entire conception of life, of man, and of the universe. The life processes, as well as the inorganic world, are found to be governed throughout by definite chemical and physical laws. The ardent advocate of the mechanistic theory goes further and proclaims that blind chance rules the uni- verse. For the personal God of our childhood days he substitutes adaptation and the survival of the fittest. In the fields of psychology the extreme behaviorists and psychoanalysts reduce human thought and consciousness to a series of mechanical reflexes which seem to the layman to hold out no hope to the mechanism known as man of personal immortality or belief in an over-ruling God. It is not strange that the majority of the men and women in this war-shattered world are unhappy because they feel that the foundations beneath them are tottering. This feeling is not without reason. In reality the old foundations *The late Professor Charles Foster Kent, represented by his widow, was present in spirit at our twenty-fifth anniversary last Christmas. Hie was the first president of NABI, and for fifteen years its guiding genius; and to no one is NABI more indebted than to him. It is highly appropriate that he bring us a mes- sage in connection with our celebration. Through the kindness of Mrs. Kent, who secured the permission of the Press of the University of Pennsylvania, we herewith reprint Professor Kent's George Dana Boardman Lecture, delivered before the University of Pennsylvania in 1925. "The following lecture was his last public word, bravely de- livered in ill health; and, as though prescient of the coming end, he made as its epilogue the noble Confession of Faith, which strikingly expresses the man and fittingly crowns his services to the world." These words, taken from the preface of an unnamed editor, express also NABI's indebtedness to his legacy; and the reproduc- tion of the lecture is all the more fitting because it bears so strikingly upon the theme of the symposiun: Framing a World- View, which was the dominant thought during the annual meeting. THE EDITOR.</page><page sequence="2">66 Journal of the National Association of Biblical Instructors are not as solid as they had thought. Some seek to fortify them by frenzied legislation or by attacking all who question their stability. Others long to sink these foundations deeper and closer to the bed-rock of reality. The latter would seem to be the only sane and safe method. This relaying of foundations is the supreme task for the present age. Upon the spirit and thoroughness with which it is done, depends the future of the individual and of humanity. It calls for vision, breadth and poise. It can be done by no one group of men, however devoted or learned. It is a task for all man- kind. Where shall we find these foundations or the material out of which to build them? Many are ready today to reject all religious and ethical teachings of the past and to find in the discoveries of science the foundations on which to build our faith and our new civiliza- tion. We already have a "Decalogue of Sci- ence." Years ago Herbert Spencer sought to formulate its gospel. Here is reality, so ma- terial that we can touch and weigh it. Here are facts that we must recognize, if our civiliza- tion is to survive. And yet will these physical facts alone furnish a foundation broad enough to support the superstructure which we desire to rear? On the other hand millions still find in an authoritative Church and an infallible Pope these needed foundations. "Will these con- tinue to satisfy?" is a question which every thoughtful student of the modern drama of life involuntarily asks. Or shall we select seven or eight dogmas, long cherished by certain sections of the church, and declare that these alone are the fundamentals on which Christianity and the religion of today and tomorrow must stand? Shall we in so doing be justified in ignoring a majority of the principles under- lying historic Christianity and the vital truths regarding life which modern science has laid bare? Deeper still is the question: Shall we build on dogmas formulated by mediaeval theologians or on facts and principles that already have been and still can be tested in the laboratory of human experience? Beyond question the Bible contains many of the most vital laws of life. It also records certain of the most significant events of human history. It has proved the inspiration and the guide to countless millions in search for truth. In this age of many books it remains the supreme guide book in the way of life. Shall we, therefore, declare it inerrant, infallible in every statement, the unchanging foundation on which we can build, confident that no part will reveal limitations and imperfections due to human origin? In so doing shall we accept the primitive and divergent traditions regard- ing the origin of man and the universe found in the opening chapters of Genesis as final and reject the testimony of that other authoritative chapter in divine Revelation clearly inscribed in the rocks? Shall we by interpreting those ancient oriental stories as scientific documents ignore their inestimable moral and religious values, which, like the parables of the New Testament, establish the supreme claim of the Bible to be "useful for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for religious instruction that the man of God may be complete and perfectly equipped for every good work?" In our search for fundamentals shall not we who bear the title Christians, whatever be our inheritance or point of approach, go back to the teachings of the common Founder of our faith and there seek to find the basal truths which once fundamentally transformed a century strikingly similar to our own? Thither any quest for Christian fundamentals logically leads us. Therefore, let us lay aside every fear and the prejudices which so easily beset us, and honestly ask the question: "Does the Jesus of history meet our challenge?"</page><page sequence="3">The Fundamentals of Christianity 67 II. The Fundamentalism of Jesus Jesus himself was in quest of fundamentals. His joy was obvious when he found that in the hour of misunderstanding and popular defection one disciple, Peter, was loyal and that, as his name suggested, he was a rock on which the Master Builder could found his be- loved community. Jesus was fully aware of the universal craving for fundamentals. The luminous des- cription of the characteristics of the true sons of God, found in Matthew 5-7, known as the Sermon on the Mount, is his concrete answer to this challenge. Briefly he describes the hap- piness, special mission, moral standards, reli- gious duties and chief dangers of those who would enter into their divine heritage and find real joy and satisfaction. At the end of this summary of his teachings he significantly de- clares: "He who hears these words of mine and acts upon them will be like a wise man who built his house upon a rock; the rain fell, the floods came, the wind blew and beat upon the house; but it did not fall, for its founda- tion was on a rock." Here we have one of the clearest revelations of Jesus' purpose. His words also imply that he himself felt that he was presenting a philos- ophy of life, so broad that every man could, with absolute assurance, make it the foundation for his daily living, as well as thinking; so vital that no man could safely neglect to build upon it. Jesus stated very clearly that he did not come to set aside the earlier teachings of the Jewish law-givers and prophets. "I did not come to set them aside but to bring them to completion." They had sought by rule, precept and ex- hortation to lay down definite laws to govern each man's action in all possible situations. This approach to the problems of life was necessarily imperfect and unsatisfactory. Jesus aimed at completeness. He therefore set forth universal principles. Usually he presented the data upon which they are based; then he left his hearers to draw their own conclusions. To make clear these data, he often used short stories or parables, which reflected the com- mon facts of experience. These parables were eminently fitted to set forth not rules but prin- ciples. For example, if the much misunder- stood parable of "The Unjust Steward," who seeing that he would be discharged, cancelled the debts due his Master, that out of gratitude they might receive his tricky servant into their home, be interpreted legalistically and literally, it would teach dishonest use of another man's property. The principle, however, of larger foresight in the use of one's personal property, which this parable dramatically sets forth, is one of the most important and revolutionary ever laid before the economic world. Mark intimates that, in teaching the people, Jesus always used parables or short stories. The statement reveals his patient zeal in hold- ing up before them their problems and in helping them to arrive at definite conclusions. Only after they themselves had drawn the natural inductions did he at times formulate the principles. Jesus' occasional direct statements of prin- ciples are masterpieces of simplicity and clarity. Some times they are paradoxical, as for ex- ample, "he who loses his life shall find it," They are always thought and act-provoking; but they are never to be interpreted as arbitrary rules. They are simply principles to be applied by each individual in the light of his own knowledge, experience and circumstance. They are, therefore, applicable in every age and situation. Parable and direct statement are effective; but Jesus used a still more dramatic way to set forth his fundamentals: he demonstrated them in his own life and in that of his loyal follow- ers. Through the vivid gospel narratives we can still see these principles in operation and judge them by their fruits.</page><page sequence="4">68 Journal of the National Association of Biblical Instructors Jesus was the most modern of ancient thinkers, the most western of eastern teachers, the practical scientist who used the scientific method centuries before it was definitely form- ulated or its epoch-making results achieved. The scientific method is the opposite of the dogmatic. It begins not with assumptions, but with a study of facts. It accepts as final only well established and cumulative testimony. On this broad basis it builds hypotheses. When these are confirmed by multiple experiments, they are accepted as working principles. The Jewish wise men, who have given us the Book of Proverbs, based their teachings on keen observation and wide experience. The recognized teachers of Jesus' day and race, however, had largely abandoned this scientific method. They depended rather upon the authority of the past and of certain famous rabbis. As a result, they no longer spoke with authority of personal knowledge and conviction. Jesus adopted the more scientific methods of the earlier Jewish wise men. Speaking of his own work, he declared: "Wisdom is known by what it achieves." He not only built squarely on facts and reality, but also taught his disciples to do the same. The suggestive formula, "Have you not seen or have you not heard?" echoes throughout his teachings. Even in discussing the deepest philosophical questions, he begins by asking his hearers to consider familiar natural phenomena, such as the life of the wild birds and the growth and beauty of the lilies. "Now," he continues, with his simple, direct logic, "if God so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today, but tomorrow is thrown into the oven, is it not far more certain that he will clothe you, O men of little faith ?" The common people heard him gladly because they recognized at once the ringing note of author- ity, based on personal experience and on a close and sympathetic observation of life. Does Jesus after nineteen centuries still com- mand the same popular following? Have the discoveries in the field of pure science, politics, economics, and psychology disproved or con- firmed the accuracy of his inductions? Are there common fundamentals upon which the modern scientists and the fearless followers of the Founder of Christianity can in this transi- tional twentieth century build their faith and life ? III. Jesus' Fundamentals Jesus' teachings are so many-sided that it is impossible to do justice to them all in a few brief statements. Any selection of his funda- mental principles will necessarily be influenced by the point of view of the one making it. Great care must also be taken not to read our modern ideas into the gospel records; and yet many of his most important principles are im- plied by his words and acts rather than directly stated. Even in the face of these difficulties the wide-spread demand for Christian funda- mentals would seem to justify the attempt to group and formulate certain of his basic prin- ciples. For a growing majority of men today, the language of theology is either obsolete or objec- tionable. Living as we do in a scientific age, we are under obligations to use the language which men understand. At the same time, tech- nical scientific terms should be avoided as far as possible. Although it is obviously impos- sible to attain the clarity and simplicity of Jesus' original statements, these should be the ideal in any modern paraphrase. To those familiar with the creed and formu- las of the Christian churches a plain statement of Jesus' basic teachings seems almost unor- thodox, for their emphasis is on life rather on creed. But to all who face squarely the dis- coveries and problems of the twentieth century, it brings deep satisfaction. Also we soon dis- cover that Jesus was not seeking to set forth a</page><page sequence="5">The Fundamentals of Christianity 69 system of Christian ethics. He was principally concerned with men's personal relation to God. Morals were essential to the establishment of that relation, for, as he said, only the clean- minded can see God; but ethics are only a corollary to the religion of Jesus. A brilliant teacher of religion has recently remarked, "If God be included in the friendly circle, social ethics become religion." Jesus would have reversed the statement: Social ethics are the necessary prerequisites and the inevitable results of seeing God. Hence, in keeping with the Boardman lec- tureship, we are endeavoring, not only to study the ethics of Jesus but also the foundations on which they rest and the motive power that inspires them. Among the many facts and principles which Jesus set forth, we of the present age may per- haps put first his statement of the great prin- ciple of progressive growth of unfolding of life. Jesus recognized the working of this principle in the physical world, "First the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear." He uses this illustration to make clear the similar development in the spiritual realm: "God's rule is like a man who sows seed in the ground and sleeps by night and rises by day, while the seed sprouts and comes up with- out his knowing it." Modern scientists are beginning to make very clear to us that upward thrust of life which begins with the smallest one-celled organism. It adapts itself marvelously to an ever-chang- ing environment. Even the most insuperable obstacles or calamities cannot permanently stay its progress. All the forces of the chemical and physical world are enlisted, until after millions of years life appears on earth incar- nate in man. The tiny blade has developed into the ear and begins to give promise of "the full grain in the ear." It was perhaps inevitable that, in discover- ing the chemical and physical processes that characterize this development and in tracing life back almost to its beginning, many scien- tists should feel that in the fortuitous combina- tions of blind matter they had found the very source of life itself. Deeper knowledge and broader vision are correcting this mistake. To- day many of the leading scientists of the Anglo-Saxon world recognize that the type of purely mechanistic interpretation which finds blind chance ruling life and the universe, sat- isfies neither the facts nor the reason. Repre- sentative of the new trend is the statement, drawn up by twenty-five prominent Americans, including fifteen eminent scientists: "It is a sublime conception of God which is furnished by science, and one wholly consonant with the highest ideals of religion, when it represents Him as revealing Himself through the in- breathing of life into its constituent matter, culminating in man with his spiritual nature and all his Godlike powers." No one would for a moment claim that Jesus anticipated the discoveries of scientists in the field of nature. He did, however, perceive the great principle of progressive growth of which the detailed discoveries are but the signal con- firmation. Jesus was interested in man's higher moral and spiritual evolution. Where the work of the modern specialist in science ends, that of the great spiritual Specialist be- gins. The broad principle that they have in common may be formulated as follows: The law of life and of the universe is that the higher forms gradually develop from the lower in accord with a definite purpose. In describing the supreme Spirit in the uni- verse, Jesus was far more eager to picture the character of God than he was to define him; more desirous of bringing men into intimate touch with him than to give them a perfect creed. In the gospel records he makes only three brief statements regarding God: "God is one God. God is spirit. God alone is good." The old anthropomorphic, nationalistic God of his race completely disappears from the pic- ture. Even the distinctive Jewish name for the</page><page sequence="6">70 Journal of the National Association of Biblical Instructors deity, Jehovah or Yahweh, also vanishes. In- stead, Jesus addresses God as "Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth." These two titles well describe the two characteristics of God which Jesus stresses. The one is that which scientists discover in the changeless laws and intricate mechanism of the physical world. It is a God whom Jesus declared sends his rain upon the good and evil alike. It is that quality in God which he, like the scientist, saw revealed in the processes of nature and in the unchanging laws which govern life. It is that aspect of the divine rule which gives to man his large free- dom of choice and corresponding responsibil- ities. Jesus proclaimed this princple most clear- ly in the parable of the servants to whom were intrusted certain talents. Each was absolutely free to use them as he wished; but for their use he was held inexorably responsible. Here is an aspect of Jesus' teachings regarding God which is often overlooked; but it is as clear as it is true to experience. The other characteristic of the great Reality which Jesus stressed is set forth with equal clarity in the stories of "The Lost Sheep," "The Lost Coin," and the matchless parable of "The Prodigal Son." In the -last, the two as- pects of the divine character are blended. The Prodigal is granted far greater liberty than would be given him by a human father. He is left absolutely free to learn his lesson in the stern school of experience. Yet when he has found himself and turns in his hour of utter need and extremity to his divine Father, he is met with love and with a response to which even the word "Father" cannot do full justice. Again the picture is absolutely true to man's deepest experience. Whenever a human being reaches the limits of his own resources and turns to the infinite Source of strength, it is never in vain. Jesus' leading teachings regard- ing God may, therefore, be briefly stated in modern terms: The one supreme Reality in the universe is spirit, just and altogether good, giving to man full freedom and responsibility, yet never failing him in his time of need. Equally central in Jesus' philosophy of life was his teaching regarding man's worth and capacity. In asserting this principle Jesus took issue with the social standards of his age and with the religious leaders of his race. The Pharisees condemned him because he reached out a helping hand and healed the sick on the Sabbath day. In common with the ancient world they valued institutions, such as the Sab- bath, far higher than they did the individual. In their laws they guarded the life of a sheep more than they did that of man. Against all this obtuseness regarding relative values Jesus protested, "Is not man worth more than a sheep ?" In man he saw culmination of the creative process. To his humble followers he declared, "In the sight of God, you are of more worth than many sparrows." Of the poor and lowly he said, "It is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish." In his day, as today, there was a vast amount of human refuse, rejected by the church and by society. In the outlawed tax-gatherers and the fallen women of the street Jesus saw in- finite possibilities of moral and spiritual growth. In many cases he signally demon- strated these possibilities. What Jesus recognized intuitively and through experience, science is discovering anew. Man stands intellectually far above all other ?animals; but it is in his moral and spiritual life that he has the greatest capacity for future development. Like the Infinite, he has consciousness and personality. He is rapid- ly becoming the master of his physical environ- ment. With the aid of memory and imagina- tion he is able to live in the past, present and future. He has vast resources of love and loyalty. He is in a very true and unique sense a son of God. Therefore, in the light of scien- tific discovery, as well as of the teachings of Jesus, we may accept as a fundamental fact: Man is of far greater worth than all else on earth, for he is the culmination of the creative</page><page sequence="7">The Fundamentals of Christianity 71 process and has the capacity for unlimited moral and spiritual development. Closely related to the preceding, is the prin- ciple of completeness implicit in Jesus' com- mand, "Be perfect even as your heavenly Father is perfect." Each new discovery of science reveals this urge toward completeness. It is one of the universal laws of nature. It governs the life of every organism. Every instinct within us cries for full expression. Our dreams by day and night reveal this inner urge. Jesus recognized this urge in the moral, as well as in the physical world. In the Old Testament scriptures he saw a record of its outworkings in the life of his race. He never made the mistake of declaring those scriptures or the moral standards that they set forth in- errant. Instead he frankly pointed out their incom- pleteness. Repeatedly he said, "Moses said to you . . . but I say to you." The old laws regarding divorce he set aside as outgrown. He declared that his task was to bring them to completeness. Jesus taught that the chief aim in the life of each individual is not self-renunciation but self-realization. To certain men, as for ex- ample, the rich young man, who came with the selfish question, "How can I inherit eternal life?" he pointed out the necessity of self- denial. Handicapped as the youth was by wealth, he must be freed before he could de- velop normally. Jesus told many a man to take up his cross and follow him; but cross- bearing was not an end in itself. "I came that men might have life and that more abun- dantly," that is "live life to the full." This full, rounded life, he pointed out, could come only through the integration of the whole self. "If a household is divided against itself, that household cannot stand" is a far-reaching statement. "The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore if your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light ... No man can serve two masters: either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be loyal to one and despise the other." This principle may be expressed in the terms of psychology: "In a fully recognized self there will be no conflict of purpose, no complexes, no repression, but the harmonious expression of all the vital forces toward a common pur- pose and end." Jesus also pointed out the value of man's complete adaptation to his social and spiritual environment. At the beginning of his sum- mary of his teachings found in Matthew 5, we read: "Happy are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the rule of God." The "poor in spirit" are those who feel the need and desire for the higher spiritual life. They are receptive, eager to live in accord with the divine rule. Hence, according to the law that those who seek, find that divine leadership is theirs. They who mourn are those who learn from experience, not only that sorrow, if rightly borne, establishes closest relations to God and to one's fellow men, but that a divine discon- tent with what is imperfect is the spur inciting to achievements which in the end bring lasting comfort. The modest are those who have conquered their childish pride and greed and are intent simply in performing each task well. As their inherited right, the best that earth can give, honor, gratitude and serenity, come to them in richest measure. Those who hunger and thirst for righteous- ness are impelled by an intense desire ever to think and feel and act aright. No painful re- grets destroy their happiness. No barriers of their own making separate them from their fellow men or from their divine Friend. The merciful are those whose love and sym- pathy go out toward all mankind and especially to those who need most their friendship. Thus they create, wherever they go, a kindly atmos- phere in which unhappiness cannot flourish. The clean-minded are those who let no preju- dice or vile thought or feeling becloud their</page><page sequence="8">72 Journal of the National Association of Biblical Instructors spiritual vision. They, therefore are able to see God at every turn, in the beauty of the landscape, in the wonders of the universe, in the eyes of those who love them, in the secret chambers of their own soul, so that they ever live in his presence. The peacemakers are the constructive work- men, the creators of harmony in the home, the school, in the business, and the professional world, who know the joy of the Creator him- self. Rightly are they called the sons of God, for they are working with him in creating a world of beauty, harmony and happiness. Into these Beatitudes Jesus put his own wealth of experience. He reveals that practical mysticism which is the foundation of his reli- gion. It is difficult to formulate in modern terms this all-embracing principle of spiritual adaptation. The central idea is: Quite apart from rank or wealth or circumstance, genuine and lasting happiness inevitably comes to those who are intent on establishing right spiritual relations with God and with their fellow men. If man is to find complete happiness and self-realization, he must be perfectly adjusted to the Source of the spiritual life. The initi- ative lies with each individual. The principle of highest loyalty is set forth by Jesus in two comprehensive statements: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind and with all your strength," and "Seek first the rule of God and his righteousness." The phrase commonly translated, "Kingdom of God," in our current versions of the Bible does not mean a dominance arbitrarily imposed upon man, but a rule voluntarily accepted by him. As Jesus declared, it is not something that can be seen objectively, but is within the minds of men. It is the divine will emerging into consciousness in the individual. It also includes the physical, moral, and spiritual laws and forces which make possible the realization of the divine purpose in the universe. Co- 6peration with these laws and forces means the attainment of all the good that life has to give. The principle underlying these teachings may be thus expressed: Man's supreme privilege is to love his divine Father whole-heartedly and to know and live in accord with his divine rule. Then all the forces of the universe will co- 6perate with him, for he is co6perating with them. In the adjustment of each individual to the divine rule, Jesus fully appreciated the practical value of prayer. The principle underlying his teachings on this subject goes down to the very roots of life: Ask and you shall receive, Seek and you will find, Knock and it will be opened to you; For he who asks, receives, He who seeks, finds, And to him who knocks, it is opened. This little poem in two stanzas, with its per- fect parallelism of thought, has always seemed to me to be a marching song. It starts with simply a request. Then the petitioner sets out in search of what he desires. In the third line he is knocking at the door. In the last line we, in imagination, see the door opening in response to his earnest endeavor. Instinctively we feel the same intense desire and persistency that is stressed in Jesus' story of the importunate widow who gave the judge no rest until her petition was granted. While Jesus taught that everything for which a man thus asked will be granted, he made it clear that infinite love and reason determine the form of the answer. The Giver knows how to give good gifts to his children. "If man asks for a loaf, he will not give him a stone." If he asks for a stone, what is best for him will be given. Often he receives a stone, for only as he sees the futility of trying to subsist on stones, can he learn the value of wholesome food. In response to his request, the Prodigal received a diet of husks. On that</page><page sequence="9">The Fundamentals of Christianity 73 diet he came to himself, and so found his Father. Prayer in the thought of Jesus is the out- reach of the individual soul toward its spiritual environment and the response of that environ- ment to the individual. To make that out- reach complete every impediment, such as doubt and hatred, must be cleared away. Then prayer becomes an invincible force. "There- fore, I say to you, believe that whatsoever you ask for in prayer you have received and it shall be yours. And whenever you stand up to pray, if you have a grievance against anyone forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your wrong doings." Prayer, as interpreted by Jesus is in no sense incompatible with the discoveries of modern science. The lowest organism is ever reach- ing out toward its environment in quest for that which will supply its needs. Even in the atom, the positive electrons revolve about and are held in balance by the negative nucleus. The more highly developed forms of plant and ani- mal life turn instinctively to those of the other sex. In man the nobler parental impulses develop into friendship of spirit with spirit and lead up to the communion of the spirit of man with the eternal Spirit. Adjustment of the highly complicated organ- ism known as man to his spiritual environment is further paralleled by that remarkable adjust- ment of the physical environment to the needs of the animal organism which Professor Hen- derson of Harvard has pointed out in his recent volumes. As the dramatic story of "The Lost Sheep" proclaims: God ever seeks those who need or seek his help. Thus science begins to reveal the broad foundations on which rest Jesus' bold asser- tions regarding prayer: Direct communion be- tween the spirit of man and the spirit of God is not only possible but every sincere, clearly defined, and persistent desire is a potent force in the universe and is realized in ways best adapted to the needs of each petitioner. After centuries of discussions regarding the origin of evil and the nature of sin, we are at last beginning in the light of modern psychol- ogy to understand Jesus' teachings on these subjects. The Jews of his day believed that most of the evils of life came from the in- fluence of a personal devil and his demonaical emissaries. In a conversation with the Pharisees regard- ing ceremonial washing, Jesus laid down the great principle that it is not from without, but that from "within, from the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual vice, acts of theft, murder, adultery, greed" and the other vices. Today we recognize that men go wrong be- cause they follow the immediate promptings of those impulses of fear or anger or greed or sex, which they, in common with the animals, inherit from innumerable earlier ancestors. All these impulses come from within. Yielding is wrong, because in so doing men disregard the higher moral and spiritual impulses implanted within them. Thus in word and practice Jesus also antici- pated another fact which science has clearly demonstrated, but which society is still slow to accept: Evil cannot be overcome by evil but simply by good. Jesus' method of dealing with evil was always positive. The only exception was when he scourged the representatives of the grafting high priests from the Temple and pointed out to the Pharisees the folly of their hypocritical methods. In these two instances he only revealed but did not cure the moral maladies. For the taxgatherers and the public prosti- tutes he had no words of denunciation. In- stead he befriended and believed in them. Like Levi and Zaccheus, they responded to his revo- lutionary methods. Hate and injustice he cured by love, never by curses and blows. For the negations of the older law, he substituted posi- tive statements. Men forgot their old malign habits, because he implanted constructive ideas and ideals in their minds. Also he set them at positive tasks.</page><page sequence="10">74 Journal of the National Association of Biblical Instructors Jesus recognized intuitively what the modern psychologist has definitely formulated: Men can be delivered from the power of these inherited impulses of anger and sex and fear, not by crushing but by redirecting them toward higher ends. They are the major motive powers in man. Sublimated they make the beast, Godlike. To enable his followers to redirect their instinc- tive fears, Jesus taught: "Have no fear of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Fear rather him who can destroy body and soul in hell." Out of the instinctive fear of men he sought to develop reverence for God. Psychology makes clear the meaning of the striking paradox: "He who finds his life shall lose it; he who loses his life shall find it." Life to many men is a satisfaction of their inherited impulses, such as greed, self-assertion, and sex. If they follow these, they fail to attain the higher spiritual life. If they refuse to be ruled by these and are responsive to the higher ideals of service, self-sacrifice, and chivalry, they find the more abundant spiritual life. Jesus declared that one of his chief aims was to help men to know the truth that the truth might make them free. In his clinics he con- stantly demonstrated the potency of knowledge and truth in freeing men. To the fear-beset, the neurotics, those suffering from functional paralysis and various repressions, he brought a message of truth that enabled them to break the bonds of their wrong habits and resolve their complexes. He never claimed that his miracles were supernatural acts. Most of them appear to have been the result of freeing men from their own baneful repressions. Jesus also intuitively recognized that char- acter is the product of cumulative acts, that it is developed under the influence of dominant mo- tives and sentiments, but that it is in the final analysis, the result, not of professions, but of definite achievements. "By their deeds shall you know men." Not those who say, "Lord, Lord," and claim discipleship, but those who have given the cup of cold water to the needy attain the rounded character. It was not the son who said he would go, but the son who went that arrived. In dealing with men's social relations Jesus also reached conclusions which the social sci- ences are simply confirming. The Golden Rule is more than a rule; it is a universal principle. It postulates the fact that in the final analysis the interests of each individual and of society are identical. It is the one universal principle that promises to solve the problems of human relations, domestic, industrial, social and inter- national. It has no bounds of race or place. It calls for absolute equality of treatment of all, including ourselves. It is the ultimate ex- pression of democracy: Each man is under obligation to use his intelligence and best efforts to promote the interest of everyone with whom he comes into contact. Into the turbulent econonmic world Jesus carried the same uncompromising democracy. He laid down the broad principle: Wealth is a merciless master, but, if used to serve mankind, may be made to yield rich returns, both here and in the life beyond. In the story of the vineyard keeper, who was horror-struck to find able men standing idle in the market-place, because they had no job, Jesus proclaims a principle that the ad- vanced leaders in industry are just beginning to accept: Society is under obligation to give to every man, who is willing to work, an oppor- tunity to earn a living wage. In the family Jesus saw the foundation and pattern of all stable society. The beloved com- munity which he established was but an exten- sion of the loyal family relations. Hence the importance of safeguarding marriage and par- enthood: "Whom God has joined together let no man put asunder." Rejecting the lax divorce laws of his race, he laid down the rule: "Whenever marriage has been divinely cement- ed by parenthood, let not society sever this bond, and whoever, in order to marry, divorces his wife, is guilty of adultery." Certainly our lax divorce practices have not demonstrated the injustice of this strict ruling.</page><page sequence="11">The Fundamentals of Christianity 75 Christendom has not yet seriously tested the validity of the principle here laid down by Jesus, for it is only one part of his philosophy of life. Society has no definite answer to the ques- tion: "What is the goal of the upward urge of life?" "Is the development of the species to go ever on until perfection is attained, only to vanish with a dying world?" Even a perfect society on earth does not satisfy the divine economy, for it cannot be permanent Jesus had a clear-cut answer: Life here on earth is a training school for the individual who lives on unendingly. Jesus and the majority of the Jews of his day believed so firmly in life after death that he spent little time discussing it. He assumed it. His reply to the question of his disciples about the future life indicates his attitude: "In my Father's house are many dwellings; if it were not so, I would have told you so." During the last week at Jerusalem, the con- servative Sadducees, who held to the ancient belief that man dies like the beast and that is the end of him, tried to entrap Jesus by a cap- tious question. They told of a woman who in succession married six brothers and at last died herself. "When they rise from the dead, whose wife shall she be?" The question was intended not only to entrap Jesus, but also to make ridiculous the Pharisaic belief in the resurrection of the body. It was one of those opportunities which the great Teacher was quick to improve. Turning to the Pharisees he said: "When people rise from dead, they neither marry nor are married, but like the angels in heaven." Then taking up the implied challenge of the Sadducees, he said; "But in regard to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob!' He is the God not of the dead, but of the living. You are greatly in error." Jesus' meaning is clear: God is the God, not of those who have ceased to exist, but of those who, like the patriarchs, are ever living. The realm of the God of the spirit is not bounded by the physical world, nor his power and loving care for his children to their life on this earth. It is only the physical body that perishes. That which is spiritual is as eternal as God himself. Jesus' intimations regarding the nature of life after death are probably the basis of Paul's hymn of immortality in I Corinthians 15. The angels, in Jewish thought, had definite spiritual bodies, not the houses of clay in which men on earth abide. Jesus implies that "Corruption cannot inherit incorruption." The far-reaching principle set forth in these passages underlies all his philosophy: The life and development of a man go on unendingly after death, and to each individual is given an habitat adapted to his changing environment. Even here the scientists recognizes but the extension of laws already familiar to the stu- dent of the physical organism. IV. A Confession of Faith May I conclude with a brief summary of the thirteen principles which are to me the founda- tions of a working philosophy of life? May I also put them in the form of a personal con- fession of faith? I believe that growth toward completeness and perfection is the great law of the universe and that the higher forms of life gradually develop from the lower. Life, therefore, means continuous progress. I believe that one intelligent, just, and divine Spirit, Lord of Heaven and Earth, is perfect- ing his good purpose through chemical, phys- ical, moral, and spiritual laws and forces, and that he is revealing himself through that up- ward thrust of life which culminates in man. I believe in the infinite worth of each in-</page><page sequence="12">76 Journal of the National Association of Biblical Instructors dividual and in his capacity for cemplete moral and spiritual development, and that the Su- preme Spirt of the universe gives him full freedom and responsibility and, like a loving father, has made ample provision for his every need. I believe that here and now in this life man is intended to attain perfect happiness, and that the full, harmonious development of all his phsyical moral and spiritual powers is possible, if he will but use the knowledge and ability at his command. I believe that man's supreme privilege is to love his divine Father whole-heartedly and to know and live in accord with his rule, as revealed in the laws of nature and in the lives of men, and that then all the forces of the uni- verse will co6perate with him, for he is co- 6perating with them. I believe that direct communion with the spirit of man and the spirit of God is wholly possible and that every sincere, clearly defined, and persistent desire is a potent force and is realized in ways best adapted to the needs of each petitioner. I believe that the evil tendencies which lead men astray, come from within and are due to the impulses, such as fear, anger, hunger, and sex-desire, inherited from innumerable ances- tors, and that they can be overcome not by crushing them, but by redirecting them toward higher ends. They are indeed the motive power within man. Rightly directed, they make him Godlike. I believe that Jesus by his words and work reveals the divine character and purpose to- ward man. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, showing men how to break the bondage of their ignorance, of their inherited impulses, and of the effects of their wrong deeds, and to attain that full moral and spiritual growth, which is to find life, and that more abundantly. I believe that each man is under obligation to use his intelligence and best efforts to promote the interests of everyone with whom he comes into contact, even as he does his own, and that this principle is the only solvent of the prob- lems of human relations, domestic, industrial, social, and international. I believe that wealth is a merciless master but if used to serve mankind, may be made to yield rich returns, both here and in the life beyond. I believe that society is under obligation to give to every man who is willing to work, an opportunity to earn a living wage and to expe- rience the joy of doing constructive work that will give him a consciousness of his divine son- ship. I believe that the family is the foundation and the pattern of all stable society, that mar- riage is the foundation of the family, and that not lax divorce laws, but truer marital love and loyalty are essential to the life and wel- fare of humanity. I believe that the life and development of man goes on unendingly beyond death, and that each individual is given an habitat adapted to his new environment. The goal of ever- developing life, which we know here, is there- fore, the perfection of the spiritual life of each individual.</page></plain_text>
