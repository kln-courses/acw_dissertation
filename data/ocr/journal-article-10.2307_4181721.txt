<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cosmic periods in the Philosophy of Empedocles' EDWIN L. MINAR, JR. I EMPEDOCLES THOUGHT of the world-process as the product of the combination and separation of the four elements earth, air, fire, and water, under the influence of Love and Strife. The elements, as well as Love and Strife themselves, are both material, in the usual sense, and divine. The process is cyclical, and consists of a succession of phases, in each of which either Love or Strife is predominant, or gaining pre- dominance, over the other: I will set forth a double doctrine: sometimes one grows out of many to exist alone, and sonmetinmes several separate themselves out of the one to exist. Twofold is the birth of mortal things, twofold their demise; for the coming together of all things begets and kills the former, and the latter in turn, as things are separated, is nourished and flies apart. And these never cease their interchange, as sometimes all things come together, by Love, into one, and sometimes, in turn, everything is borne apart by the hate that is in Strife. So insofar as one has learned to be born from several and several, again, have emerged as one is divided up, to this extent they are subject to birth and their life is not lasting. But insofar as they never cease constantly interchanging, to this extent they exist forever, unnmoved throughout the cycle. (Fr. 1 7. I- 1 3). It is clear that, in the ordinary course of things, both Love and Strife are at work, though at any moment one may be gaining over the other; but what is the nature of the transition from the period of one's growth to that of the other? There must be a moment at least, or an era, when each of the two reaches, or enjoys, the apogee of its influence, before beginning to decline. If these are moments, one will speak of two cosmic phases, if eras, of four. This problem has been answered in both ways, for unfortunately the evidence from the fragments of Empedocles' poems is not unambiguous.2 It is not proposed to discuss this question here; it is enough to note that whether the periods in question are eras or moments, they should have some definable characteristics. Empedocles makes it clear that the effect of Love is increasingly close association among the elements, so that they voluntarily seek combi- I Presented at a meeting of the Society for Ancient Greek Philosophy, at Ann Arbor, Michigan, December 196I. 2 Aristotle thought there were four periods, two of activity, when Love or Strife is gaining, set apart by two intermediate periods of rest; but the lines he quotes in support do not seem to bear this meaning. (Phys. 8. I. 25o b 26; cf. Zeller-Nestle 16 971 n. 1) 1 27</page><page sequence="2">nation with each other, while the opposite tendency of Strife is to nmake them hate and withdraw from one another. There is no evidence as to what phase Empedocles used as the starting-point of his exposition, and no likelihood that any of them was thought of as primary. The period of Strife's growing influence brings the progressive disintegration of things, culnminating in a state in which the four elements are completely separated from each other, and Love is presunmably exclude(d. Her re- entry, however, and growth in power, bring about a more and more thorough mixture of the elements, a steadily increasing integration of the world. What would be the culmination of this process? Parmenides had said, of that which exists, Motionless within the limits of mighty bonds, it is without beginning or end, since corning into being and perishing have beeni driveii far away, cast out by true belief. Abiding the same in the same place it rests by itself, and so abides firm where it is; for strong Necessity holds it firm within the bonds of the limit that keeps it back on every side ... But since there is a furthest limit, it is bounded on every side, like the bulk of a well-rounded sphere... (Fr. 8. 26-3 I, 42-43, tr. Kirk and Raven.) This picture must have been in Empedocles' mind, and many have supposed that it provi(led him with a pattern of perfection. And he does say (fr. 17.7, quoted above), "sometimes all things come together, by Love, into one." This can be interpreted to nmean that at the triumph of Love the world becomes a thoroughly uniform mixture, motioniless and spherical. Though really early evidence for such an interpretation is scanty, it is advanced by sonme of the commentators on Aristotle, in the Neoplatonic period. Philoponus, for example, writes, Again (Enipedocles) says that during the donminance of Love, all things becomie one an(d produce the sphere, which is without quality, so that neither the peculiar character of fire nor of any of the others is any longer preserved in it, each of the elenments shedding its particular form. I Simplicius also speaks of "the sphere" (De caelo g28. i i, not in DK), but without explicitly denying it all quality: "Empedocles says that this I De gen. et corr. 1 9. 3; DK 3 1 A 41. This is not an independent testimony, but merely a paraphrase of Aristotle De gen. et corr. 3 xa 3, and "very inaccurate in its inferences", as E. Millerd points out (On the interpretation of Empedocles, p. 6 1 n. 5). His word &amp;7roLoV is not found elsewhere in the tradition. Cf. H. A. T. Reiche, Emnpedocles' nmixture, Eudoxan A stronomy, and Aristotle's connate pneuma (Amsterdanm, I 960), p. 40. This book, which reached me after the present paper was comlpleted, discusses somle of the same topics, mostly from a different point of view. 1 28</page><page sequence="3">cosmos comes to be under the influence of Strife separating out the elements, just as the sphere does under the influence of Love combining and uniting them. " Here it appears that Empedocles regarded the present era as one in wlhich Strife is gaining in strength, at the expense of Love; and corrob- orating evidence on this point will be mentioned later. What does this mean about the cosmic, and cultural, process? Surely, for one thing, that the present is a period of decline and that the past was better - both the reign of Love, if it was an extended period, and the early part of the period of Strife's gain, when of course Love would still be very powerful. It is not surprising, then, to find Empedocles speaking else- where, nostalgically, of a past Golden Age (fr. I 28-I 3o). To those recent scholars who see his thought as a unity, this is one of the indications of the general parallelism between his two poems. But where precisely does the Golden Age belong? The best suggestion, along these lines, seems to be that of Kahn, who puts it "very early in the present phase of the world cycle, when the Sphere has given way to individual creatures but Strife has not gained full mastery over Love. "' Presumably, then, there would be another similar or identical condition just before Love's complete triumph. We should have the picture, then, of "countless tribes of mortal things," and blessed daemons, living an increasingly rich and conmplex life, till one day they fuse into a single mass - "divine" in some sense - splherical, but otherwise without form or quality, without motion or any other sign of life. Then, after an indeterminate period, the nearly-ideal condition - the Golden Age - suddenly re- appears, or restores itself, as a result of the renewed activity of Strife, and the long process of decadence begins. This is certainly a strange conception; and though it is dangerous to expect a great and original mind to conform to canons of "common sense" or consistency, it may be suggestive to consider the possibility that we have misinterpreted the poet's meaning. The crucial fragment is 27, whose text is given as follows in Diels- Kranz: 9VO' OUT CXOLOL&amp; 8&amp;Lt&amp;oL dox?oc yuLt 'gi ,L-SV O' att7)q 'aCLOV QUEVOg OU8 OaXCXaaM- o&amp;i&amp; XG'Ap,uovLrc 7rUXLVW XXpU9CP) ?5CTY)pLXTML E9qCLpOq xUXXOeTjp4 ULOVVl 7MpLVy?L yOCLov. I C. H. Kahn, "Religion and natural philosophy in Empedocles' doctrine of the soul", AGP 42 (I960) ,3-35, at p. 21 n. S4. This does not fully satisfy Kahn, who finally pronounces a verdict of non liquet on the connexion between the unity of the sphere and that of "the company of the blessed daimons" (p. 26). 1 29</page><page sequence="4">Lines I and 3-4. are quoted by Simplicius, in the context of a discussion of motion and rest, as referring to the rule of Love: This would seem to be what Empedocles means when he says that it belongs to the necessity of things that Love and Strife hold power and cause motion alternately, and if so he also implies that a state of rest intervenes. For rest is intermediate between opposite motions. But Eudemus understands the state of rest to exist during the domi- nance of Love, in the sphere, when everything is combined: 'The sun's swift limbs are not there descried', but as he says, 'So he lay steady in the close-built hiding place of Harmony, Sphere well-rounded, rejoicing in surrounding solitude.' This seems to carry the Peripatetic discussion, and also the difference of opinion as to Empedocles' meaning, back to the fourth century B.C. This disagreement is easy to understand, for of course Empedocles was not writing on the theory of motion, in Aristotelian terms. The usual description of the nature of the reign of Love and that of Strife may have developed, in part at least, from the doctrine here expressed that "rest is intermediate between opposite motions." It is striking that Plutarch cites lines X and 2 as referring to the world of Strife, in a paragraph which, though syncretistic, seenms clear enough about Empedocles: So look out and reflect, good sir, lest in rearranging and removing each thing to its 'natural' location you contrive a dissolution of the cosmos and bring upon things the 'Strife' of Empedocles - or rather lest you arouse against nature the ancient T-itans and Giants and long to look upon that legendary and dreadful disorder and discord when you have separated all that is heavy and all that is light. 'The sun's bright aspect is not there descried, / No, nor the shaggy might of earth, nor sea' as Empedocles says. Earth had no part in heat, water no part in air; there was not anythinig heavy above or anything light below; but the principles of all things were untempered and unamiable and solitary ... So they were until desire came over nature providentially, for Affection arose or Aphrodite or Eros, as Empedocles says and Parmenides and Hesiod...2 Diels combined the two citations into a single fragment, choosing Simplicius' uxeot yuZm over Plutarch's &amp;yXmotv e'Boq in line i. Bignone gave the lines cited by Plutarch as fr. 26a, and thought that while they referred to the reign of Strife, fr. 27 (Simplicius' version) can-e from the section on Love.

Given the uncertainty of the tradition, it is difficult to know which testimony we should prefer.' It is quite possible that, as Bignone thought, this is one of the cases of repeated lines in Empedocles, and a similar description was given, in two parts of his book, of the state of the world at the two extremes.2 In many respects the two periods would indeed be very similar - as is understandable since Love and Strife are equal in "rights" - only that in one the elements are perfectly mixed, in the other perfectly separated, so that the evidence of this fragment would describe the world of perfect Strife at least as well as that of perfect Love. One might suppose that sun, earth, and sea are here three of the four elements, "descried" - because completely separated - during the period of Strife but in that of Love thoroughly mixed; but the expressions "sun's swift limbs" (or "shining face") and "earth's shaggy might" would in that case seem odd. He must be re- ferring to the earth, sun, and sea as physical aggregates, components of the world as we know it, so that there is no warrant here for thinking of the "disappearance of the elements".3 It is precisely the elements that are permanent, as the poet says many times. They "run through each other" but remain themselves. Their orderly arrangement, sq eva xoastov, is the work of Love, their separation into OXOaaCTLL (Plutarch's word) that of Strife. It is much harder to imagine for Empedocles than for a neo-Platonist that the increasingly orderly cooperation of the elements, in the proper proportion, should be thought of as leading to the disappearance of earth, sea, and sun - or of the four elements - or to their amalgamation into an undifferentiated One. What do lines 3-4 mean? It is commonly assumed that Harmony means Love, which provides the 7rUXLVOr XpUcpoq in which the god Sphere, who equals the rounded totality of things, is ensconced. But it I It is very clear from various Neoplatonizing explanations that Simplicius was influenced in his general interpretation of Empedocles by his own philosophical predilections. The whole system was allegorical to him, the chronological account given by Empedocles was 8caxcOXcqg yaptv and represented coexisting aspects of the world. In particular "the Sphere" was the symbol of the x6aco4 vo2yr6q or intelligible world. (DK 31 A 52, esp. Simpl. De caelo 304. 4, and ibid. I4I. 10, 305- J?, Phys. I 12I. 17, 2Sff., ii86. 30 if. Cf. Bignone, pp. s89ff.) jThe Sphere" was also, by various of the later commenta- tors, interpreted as meaning formless matter, efficient cause, or the Stoic original fire (Zeller-Nestle 16 97S). 2 See E. Bignone, Empedocle, pp. 220 ff., and the other references cited by Cherniss, Plut. Moralia. (Loeb) XIl p. 8 2 note c. 3 E.g., F. Solmsen, Aristotle's system of the physical world (Ithaca, i960), p. 372 n. i6, 375 n. 31. ' 3'</page><page sequence="6">is by no means certain that we should capitalize &amp;p,tovL1. Harmony is one of the nymphs in the catalogue of fr. I 2 2, paired with AipLq; but neither there nor in fr. 96.4 is it certainly a synonym for 4tXLcx. Could these lines too refer to Strife's reign? Even that has its own appropriate kind of "fitting-together"; at least we learn (in fr. 26. 7) that a process of "growing into one" ('v uppU,V'r) accompanies the utter destruction (X0 7rV ViT5vspOe yeMyTaL) which Strife brings. In any case the interpretation of line 3 is difficult. What is it to be "firmly fixed in the close-packed hiding place of fitting-togetherness" and at the same time to be the whole of things, spherical, solitary (or motionless) and happy? This does not describe Love, as we know her from other fragments, but is quite appropriate to Strife, the Empedoclean force which works for separation and hence would naturally exult in solitude. Could the poet here be reflecting satirically the views of Parmenides, and showing that the static world he had prized is really only appropriate to Strife? The latter is in fact not only bad but, in spite of his status, stupid. Intelligence, we learn from other fragments, belongs to all living things (fr. I I o. i o), but increases as the mixture which Love causes becomes more perfect.' Strife is now victorious; segregation is complete, but what seems to him a cozy nook is in fact a prison. He does not know better than to rejoice, forsooth, in a solitude which gregarious Love would abhor.2 In fr. 29. 1-2, the world (under Love's rule, according to Hippolytus) is described as without wings, feet, nimble knees or sex organs, and as being "a sphere, and equal to itself in all directions". In fr. 134, speaking of Apollo in particular and of "the divine" in general, according to I "Only the delight of the Sphairos in his solitude is out of keeping with Empedocles' conception of the god," says Jaeger, Theology of the early Greek philosophers p. 14X. His proposal to take .Aovbn as "rest" rather than "solitude" does not affect the present argument. The concept of the sphere as Love's product leads Jaeger to say, "In this way Empedocles retains the Eleatic Being as one stage in the cycle: it is the stage when the divine Love which keeps the world going has realized its dominion and become fully achieved" (ibid.) The supreme achievement of the power which "keeps the world going" is to bring it to a full stop! 2 xpu (line 3) is variously interpreted. Is it equivalent to XpU(L6rq, as LSJ think, thus meaning something like 'secrecy" (Freeman), "obscurity", and hence "lurking-place", "cave" (antre, Zafiropulo), whether entered voluntarily, as yoEwv in line 4 might suggest, or involuntarily, as EarI'pLX-rML suggests (so Verliess, "dungeon", DK)? Or is it parallel to xput'ov O6ev (a conjectural reading for xpu'cpov) in Pind. 01. 2. 97, in which case it might mean something like "covering" (Burnet, Kirk and Raven)? If the interpretation suggested here is correct, the ambiguity may be intentional. 132</page><page sequence="7">Ammonius, the poet gives a somewhat fuller description repeating two lines of fr. 29. He does not have a human head, no wings, feet, nimble knees, or sex-organs, "but was solely a sacred and ineffable mind, darting through the whole cosmos with swift thoughts." To Empedocles all the elements, as well as Love and Strife, are divine, and this would well apply to Love. It is quite appropriate, indeed inevitable, to think of Love as permeating the whole of the cosmic order (x6apov a6btvr() of which she is the creator; but she is not the same as the spherical divinity of fr. 29, who seems to be the same as the aloof personage of 27 and 28, "rejoicing in circular solitude".' The parallelism of 29 and 134 suggests, too, that the idea of sphericity, as applied to gods, was for Empedocles related rather to an anti-anthropomorphic ideal, to the self-equality, consistency, and actual or potential omnipresence of divinity than to any homogeneous or motionless quality. There are no other passages in which the wvord acZpoq or any of its derivatives is used in the actual fragments of Empedocles. It is not found in Aristotle, who in his references to the stage of Love's dominance uses the colorless expressions ro-L ,y,uc or ro ev.2 "Sphere" is normally feminine in Greek and it might be thought that Empedocles' use of the masculine suggests a personification. We learn from Simplicius, however (Phys. I I 24; DK 16 3 24. I 6) that somewhere in the poem the neuter form was used. Thus there is little or nothing to suggest the divine Sphere, as equiva- lent with the totality of things, at the apogee of Love, in the fragments themselves, in Aristotle or Theophrastus, and also not in the Peripatetic doxographical tradition through which most of our information about I There is no reason to attribute 134 to the Purifications, except Diels' assunmption that anything to do with religion is from that poem.

That Aristotle refers to "the Sphere" with the words roi Oeoi5, De gen. et corr. 3 3 3 b 2 I (DK 3 I A 4o) is an assumption that begs the question at issue here. In the context of Aristotle's argument it need not mean more than "the Deity", as the Oxford translation has it. Aristotle understands Empedocles' eti x6aproq in the light of later metaphysical concepts of -rso v, and is thus able to castigate him for not defining adequately the relation between "the one" and the plural elements (as at De gen. et corr. 3 1 S a 3ff.). Similarly, he supposes that in bringing things together into a unity Love "destroys" everything else mivxyouacx yap eEcl 6 &amp;v 9pO3tpeL Ta' &amp;X?X, Met. B i ooo b i i). But there is nothing in his comments to indicate that the world's shape is spherical. Perhaps this is odd, if that was so, or was clearly expressed by Empedocles; Aristotle has a good deal to say, especially in the De caelo, about the properties of spheres. ' 33</page><page sequence="8">his physical philosophy is transmitted.' Neither is it attested in the partly independent tradition about Empedocles' religious views as ex- pressed in the Pur!fications. In fr. 26. 3-I, Empedocles summarizes the cosmic processes: These things themselves exist, and running through one another they become men and the tribes of other beasts, at one time coming together by Love into a single cosmos, at other times, in turn, each being borne apart through the hatred in Strife, till growing together into one they are completely subdued. The latter part of this seems to be paraphrased by Aristotle: "When the whole is dissolved into the elements by Strife, then fire is aggregated into one, as is each of the other elements" (Met. A 98g a 2g; DK 31 A 37). Thus the elements at this tiine are collected into homogeneous masses. It has been suggested that the world was now spherical, and indeed that it may have consisted of a set of concentric spheres, pre- sumably with Love as the outermost of them, and -with Strife permeating the whole.2 What was the shape of the cosmos produced by Love? ELnpedocles would have had precedent for thinking of it as spherical. It the drum- shaped earth of Anaximander hangs free in its place because it is equi- distant fronm the circumference, a spherical world is implied.3 But in fr. 35, which describes the growing influence of Love, the shape is by no means unambiguous. Strife apparently has arrived "at the lowest I Hippolytus Ref. 7. 2 9 (DK 16 3 24. 1 2 - I 6, introducing fr. 2 9) implies a relation between Love and the sphere, but the implication nmay well be that of Hippolytus himself, follow- ing the conventional interpretation. Aetius 1.7.26 (Dox. 303) (lescribed the divinity according to Parmenides as xLpoeL3Pk, but no such word appears in the section (28) on Empedocles. Diels however proposed two conjectural restorations which are printed in DK 3i A 32, introducing both the words acpoposeL; and ZpcxZpo4. It is obvious from the text as it stands that the doxographers were concerned with the peculiar re- lationship of the one and many in EmLpedocles' cosmology and theology, and the ab- sorption of the many into (or separation out of) the one (owaXuOar,sT). Usener's conjecture (DK 16 289. i i n.) (foes justice to this. But there is no positive justification for inclusion of the idea of sphericity. (Indeed the first restoration is given "beispiels- weise" in RhAl 36 (1881) 34S.) The phrase ro [ev 'Ev -r'v &amp;Vv&amp;yxzv (DK 16 289.9) is obviously wrong.

She is an etel-nal oracular power, doubtless the guarantor of the oath that assures the equal rights of Love and Strife (fr. 30. 3) and so far from being identical with the "one cosmos" of Love's reign that Charis "hates unbearable Necessity" (fr. i i 6). 2 E.g., Kirk and Raven, pp. 34sf. 3 DK 12 A i i, etc.; cf. C. H. Kahn, Anaximander and the origins oJ Grcek cosmology (New York, 1960), pp. 53, 77. ' 34</page><page sequence="9">depth of the whirl", and Love is "at the center" of it (if aLtv and atpop&amp;- Xl.yR are synonyms). "All these things" (the elements) come together voluntarily to make a unity. Strife passes "out", "to the furthest bounds of the circle" (E'' e`CTZ roc tzpptorao XsUAou). In addition, a passage of Aetius suggests an elliptical or egg-shaped world: Empedocles said that the horizontal extent is greater than the upward measurement from the earth to the sky, that is the distance from us, the world being, according to this, more spread out because the cosmos is like an egg" (DK 3 1 A so). Perhaps the world is elliptical under the more dynamic rule of Love and spherical under the static influence of Strife, and there is truth in Simplicius' isolated comment (inconsistent with his general interpre- tation) that Empedocles distinguished the aoycpoq from the x6a,toq.l The world is to be sure a living and divine being,2 which at this stage attains a state of peace - of cosmos. What is more, in a protest against anthropomorphism that is reminiscent of Xenophanes, Empedocles speci- fies that it not only does not have members like ours but is equal to itself in every direction and "endless", which may mean spherical in shape; but that is not to say that it is completely homogenized, nor that it does not have "members" at all. (Indeed this would be quite inconsistent with fr. 3 I: 7OtV' c yep &amp;rc 7exltLeTO yuZo OEOZo.) The divinity of the world as a whole was a quite general assumption in Empedocles' day. Perhaps the question is best left undecided whether the whole was spherical, either all the time or at the two extreme states. The main point to be made here is the unlikelihood that there was anything unique about the sphericity of Love's world, and the in- appropriateness of the supposition that "the Sphere" was a new contri- bution to theology. Simplicius speaks of "Love, by unification making the sphere, which he also calls a god, though he somewhere uses the neuter: 'It was a sphere"' (Phys. 1124.1; DK 16 324. i6). This ex- pression seems to mean that in Simplicius' mind, though Empedocles speaks of the world as spherical, he would not have used the neuter if its name were Sphere. Elsewhere Simplicius speaks of "the sphere" I De caelo 139 b i6 (Schol. in Ar. 489 b 22; Zeller-Nestle 16 975 n. 7; not in DK). 2 "But when Strife had grown great within its limbs, and sprang to its privileges as the time was fulfilled, which is fixed for them as alternate by a broad oath" (fr. 30; cf. 31, 35. ii). Fr. 27a olu catgiaLt ou&amp; te 81pLq XVmaLcL0q O v &amp;9e?&amp;eaavL) does not apply to the world as a whole, or to the god Sphere, but as Plutarch's introductory words show, to an individual human being, presumably at the time of the predominance of Love. (If it is an Empedoclean fragment at all, as Wilamowitz conjectured, and as the language seems to indicate.). I 35</page><page sequence="10">in a way that scarcely seems to justify modern editors in capitalizing it, and there is nothing about the god Sphere in the doxographical reports about Empedocles' theology. Even if there were a god Sphere, he would be a veritable Augenblicksgott, existing only for while at a tinle, at one, or two, stages in the cyclic cosmic process. It seems misleading, there- fore, to speak of him as in some way different from other gods, or occupying a special transcendent position.' Any interpretation of his cosmic periods must take account, it would seem, of the fact that for Empedocles the effects of Love are desirable, those of Strife noxious. Professor Vlastos emphasizes the equality in prerogatives of the two, and concludes that by the "equalitarian justice" which Empedocles conceives as prevailing in the cosmos, "were not Harmony matched to its perfect equal in Strife, there would be no created world, only the nondescript mixture of the Sphairos".z This would require us to see the complete prevalence of either one as an unfortunate though luckily temporary episode in cosmic history. The reign of Love would be as much an cixoa,thx as that of Strife. It is of course true that they are "equal" in force and in rights, sealed by broad oaths. And Empedocles accepts the world as such a world; but this is acceptance of the ineluctable necessities of life. It is this affirmation of a heroic and tragic and characteristically Greek view which gives the tone of tender melancholy which so many readers detect in the poet, rather than any rejection of life or yearning to be free of it. The period of the growth of Love is characterized by an increasing tendency for "things" to "come together", and Empedocles makes quite clear that the things he means here are the elements.3 Fire, water, earth, and air, that is, work together more and more congenially under Love's tutelage, in the formation of a more and more nearly perfect universe. It never achieves complete perfection, perhaps, in the usual sense, because that might seem to imply permanence, or lasting immunity to Strife. On the other hand, Empedocles may have been less enamoured of this sort of static perfection than some others. Perhaps the gay and rather complicated world to which fr. I 28 (quoted below) seems to refer was more to his I E.g., Jaeger, Theology of the early Greek philosophers, pp. 142, 1 g3; cf. Kahn, 'Religion . . . ", p. 2i1. 2 G.

And the "one" is the "one cosmos". 1 36</page><page sequence="11">liking. For the kind of unity to which Love leads is precisely the complex unity in which diverse elements cooperate to form a "cosmos". On the other hand, though the primary effect of Strife is "separation", it is the elements which are separated from one another, and in this process they "grow together" into separate and, this time, really homogeneous masses, and this is tantamount to the destruction of everything save the elements themselves (fr. 26.7, quoted above). One of the supports of the conventional' interpretation of the rule of Love is the famous couplet, fr. I 7. 7-8: &amp;?o-re 1Lev 0'DLX671Tt auvepX6lLvv' et4 9v &amp;TnXVTXc, &amp;,Xote 8' oi' 8LX X gxeXrtX yopeup.vo Ne'Lxso5 9xOet. Here it is clear, as remarked above, that the "unity" described is the opposite of the separation of the elements. In fr. 20.2, line 17. 7 recurs.

In 17. 7 the text is uncertain.

That the progressive development of a cosmos is one of growing complication can be seen from the lines of fr. I 7 (9- I 3) quoted above: So insofar as one has learned to be born from several, and several again have emerged as one is divided up, to this extent they are subject to birth, and their life is not lasting. But insofar as they never cease their constant interchange, to this extent they exist forever, unmoved throughout the cycle. In the context the word "unmoved" (&amp;xLvwnot) seems peculiar until we realize that this is a piece of anti-Parmenidean polemic. The motionless- ness or changelessness of the elements means not that they are immobile, but that they are not altered qualitatively. Because of the influence of Love, who is worshiped by mortals, too, as inborn in their members, and by whom they think thoughts of amity and perform the works of concord, calling her joy by name, or Aphrodite (fr. 1 7. 2 2-24), are produced all trees, and men and women, beasts and birds, and fishes nourished in deep waters,aye, the long-lived gods, in honors excellent ' 37</page><page sequence="12">(fr. 21. IO-12, tr. Leonard), "men and the tribes of other beasts" (fr. 26. 4.), those "myriad tribes of mortal things" (fr. 3 S i 6) of which the poet speaks so often and with such affection. In fr. 1 28 we seem to have an actual description of the reign of Love: nor unto them was any Ares god, nor Kydoimos, nor Zeus, the king of gods, nor Kronos, nor Poseidon then, but only Kypris queen... whom they with holy gifts were wont to appease.' What impresses in the "unifying" effect of Love is not a tendency to growing uniformity; things are not melting together or "fusing", but becoming increasingly individual, unique, and multifarious: 7OCVrOLOLq 18kfnaLV ap2npOTOX, OcOJ5a .L38GOaL We can tell something of Empedocles' ideal world fronm his es- chatological notions. He adopts from the Orphics and Pythagoreans the idea of transmigration, and with it a part of the i(lea of the unhappiness of man's lot. It is also clear that the soul is disadvantaged by being relegated from a realm where Love rules to this world in which Strife is unhappily so prominent (fr. 1 I8). But Kahn is right in emphasizing that "Empedocles is no more a Buddhist than he is a Christian. The terms he uses suggest the continued, harmonious coexistence of discrete individuals. "2 In the Purifcations, Empedocles represents himself in striking terms as having attained an exalted state: Friends who dwell throughout the great town of golden Acragas, up by the citadel, men mindful of good deeds, unversed in wickedness, havens of respect for strangers, all hail. I go about among you all an immortal god, mortal no more, honoured as is my due and crowned with garlands and verdant wreaths. Whenever I enter the prosperous town- ships with these my followers, men and women b)oth, I am revered; they follow nme in countless numbers, asking where lies the path to gain, some seeking prophecies, while others, for many a day stabbed by grievous pains, beg to hear the word that heals all manner of illness. (Fr. X I 2, tr. Kirk and Raven.) The god that is each one of us (fr. i i E. g), then, if he has achieved the degree of purification which the poet thought he had reached, will in I Lines 1-4, tr. Leonard. If this fragment is from the Purifications, as is usually assunmed, Kirk and Raven are right in seeing it as an indication of the parallelism between the two poems. However, it comports poorly with their picture of the rule of Love as an undifferentiated mass (p. 34-). 2 "Religion.. ." p. 25. 1 3 8</page><page sequence="13">times like these, when Strife is on the increase, do the sort of thing Empedocles is doing, associating with his beloved fellows, alleviating their misery and improving their lot as best he can. Though he may feel himself an exile (puy&amp;4 OeOev xox 'L fr. II . I3), repine at his temporary lot (x?oJaa -re xotL xc'xuacv 186v &amp;auv'6ex ;cfipov, fr. i i 8), and long to return to the society of Love's reign (fr. 146-147), there is no reason to suppose that this would be a permanent state of bliss or salvation - or that he will wish to dissolve, or devote himself to rotating, or to contemplating complacently the circumambient solitude. Excellent testimony as to the sort of result Empedocles attributed to the increasingly good (not necessarily more thorough) mixture of elements is provided in Theophrastus' summary of his doctrine of perception: Those in whom the elements are mixed equally or nearly so and not at great intervals nor in particles too small or too large, are the most intelligent and most keen in sense- perception, and proportionately those closest to them in this respect, and those in the opposite condition are least intelligent. Those in whom the elements are combined in loose and light texture are torpid and easily-tired. Those in whom the elemental particles are close-fitting and broken down into small bits, such persons are considered keen, and though projecting many things they accomplish few because of the speed of the blood's move- ment. But those in each of whose parts the mixture is even will be wise by virtue of this; this is why some are good speakers, some good artisans, because some have such a mixture in their hands, others in their tongues. And it is the same with the other faculties. (De sensu ii; DK 3 A 86. II.) The result of a "good" mixture, in other words, under the influence of Love, is the farthest thing from a homogeneous mass. The second italicized phrase shows that the elemental particles become very small; the first, that they do not become "too small "; rather than fusing together, they retain their specific and permanent qualities and powers. This is what produces the finest distinctions and the most highly articulated re- lationship of the parts of the universe. The organs become more and more keen and competent, and human beings develop more and more skills and specialties. (Incidentally, such a situation is not inconsistent with a spherical shape for the universe as a whole.) Empedocles seems to prize harmony, cosmos, the meaningful articu- lation of parts into a whole - which he does not hesitate to call a single whole. But he does not emphasize the aspect of harmony or cosmos which most pleased the Pythagoreans: the orderliness of each thing assuming and keeping its proper place. There is very little about the majesty of law, or the pleasures of hierarchy, in our poet. It is Strife that I 39</page><page sequence="14">sorts things according to their kind, and endeavors to keep them in isolation. Strife is thus in a sense more orderly, in its procedures and effects, than Love is. Of course there are different kinds of harmony: Anaximander, no Pythagorean, liked xo6po4; Protagoras saw value in In general, one wonders whether Empedocles is as close to the Pythagoreans as is sometimes supposed. He takes a polemical posture toward their (partly heretical) follower Parmenides, and is certainly very un-Pythagorean in the open way in which he publishes his doctrines. He also seems to have shown much more interest in empirical know- ledge, the details of physical and zoological science - to say nothing of his democratic politics. He is not keen on Pythagorean numerology; to be sure he speaks in terms of quantitative comparison and even of proportion, but the distinctive thing about his analysis of organic com- pounds is the emphasis on the qualitative., The Pythagorean cosmology, on the other hand, scarcely concerns itself with qualitative distinctions but is very explicit about quantitative relationships. The Purifications show an influence of Orphic and Pythagorean ideas, though here too there are differences.2 Some of the difficulty in the usual interpretation of Empedocles' cosmic periods becomes more sharply apparent if we consider what correlation they may have had with his analysis of organic evolution. For while the four cosmic periods (if there are four) will not of course correspond exactly to the four stages of biological evolution of which we have some reflection in the fragments (57-62) and a fairly clear account in a paragraph of Aetius, it seems very likely that in a system worked out in such detail the two sorts of periods were in some way I Here I should disagree with Prof. Solmsen (Aristotle's system of the physical world 37 2f. and "Tissues and the soul", Phil. Rev. 59 (19;o) 446f.), and with Kirk and Raven, who speak of "the exact proportion in which these substances are compounded" (p. 33S; my italics). This is to ignore the line eWr 6X?yov ,(tccav et- 7,e6vea:cv &amp;x'aecv "either a little more of it or less of it with more of the others" (fr. 98. 4), as well as the word [LiVa'roc "about" (line i). Empedocles seems to give an exact ratio in 96 and in the paraphrase of Aetius (DK 3 I A 78), but 98 shows that, though he thought there was a certain ratio in each case, he did not place great importance on stating it with mathe- matical precision. 2 He may be referring to Pythagoras in fr. 129, though the XCLvOLaLV of line I is more likely the people of the golden age of Love; cf. Gjv i TL4 &amp;v XCLVOtaLv with fr. i28. l: ou -rLTq hV XeVOlaLV. (Jaeger doubts the identification, Theology p. I51.) 140</page><page sequence="15">correlated. Aetius' account, which doubtless stems from Theophrastus, may be translated as follows: Empedocles believed that the first births of animals and plants were by no means com- plete, but were disjunct, consisting of parts that were not grown together. The second group, though with limbs that were grown together, were like creatures in dreams. The third group of births were of the whole-natured; the fourth group came no longer from the same kind of source, as for example from earth and water, but from one another, in some cases because of the condensation of their nourishment, in others because the beauty of the females caused an excitation of the movement of sperm. (DKK3i A72.) Recapitulating, the four stages are characterized by the appearance of (i) separate members or parts of animal and plant bodies (the "neckless heads" and "browless eyes" of fr. 57), (2) creatures having more than one "part" each, but sometimes in monstrous combination (the creatures with countless hands and trailing feet" of fr. 6o and the "man-faced ox-breed" of fr. 6i), (3) "whole-natured" forms, and (4.) plants and animals that reproduce as now. This seems most naturally interpreted as a continuous series of stages showing the increasing complication of modes of generation during the increasing influence of Love.' The cryptic description of the creatures of the third stage as "whole- natured" can best be explained by reference to fr. 62, where the same word is used: Now come, hear how fire, separating out, brought forth the night-clad shoots of men and tearful women; for the tale is not wide of the mark nor without knowledge. First there rose whole-natured forms from earth, having their proportion of both water and warmth. For fire sent them up,wishing to reach its like, not yet showing the lovely form of limbs nor voice nor sex-organs such as are usual for men. Here Empedocles is describing especially the origin of human beings (as is shown by the first, and confirmed by the last line), but it is natural to assume that the same sort of description would apply to other creatures, and plants as well.z They spring from earth, and this is only one of many reflections of that age-old mythical idea in Greek scientific thought.3 They will have earth in their makeup, then, and they also "have their proportion of both water and warmth" (lines 4-5). Empe- I "Die Entstehung der Tiere und Menschen dachte sich Empedokles durch mehrere aufeinanderfolgende Vorgange vermittelt, die ebensoviele Versuche einer immer voll- kommeneren Vereinigung ihrer Teile darstellen", Zeller-Nestle 16 986. 2 This seems to follow from the parallel with the Aetius passage, where "animals and plants" are mentioned. Cf. Zeller-Nestle 16 987 n. 2. 3 W. K. C. Guthrie, In the beginning, (London, 1957), ch. 2. 141</page><page sequence="16">docles' attention does not stray far from the mixture of elements; air is not mentioned, but it is obvious that when these creatures emerged into the air they began to partake of it, i.e. to breathe. And though the propelling force behind their origin may be Strife (for this is what causes things to seek their like, as fire does here), will they not now also begin to partake of the influence of Love? This is foreshadowed in the tw&amp; of line 7: they do notyet show the perfection of form or voice, or the power of sexual reproduction which we think of as characteristic of men and women, but the tendency of development is in that direction. ThouLgh still very "primitive", these people are surely not the shapeless lumps or masses of which some scholars speak.' In other words, the "whole- natured forms" represent a further stage in cosmic evolution beyond what might well be called the "part-natured forms" of stages 1 and 2. It is not clear whether stages X and 2 are inter(lependent, as they would have to be if the system were to be described as truly evolutionary, in the Darwinian sense, though a comment of Aristotle shows that in the second stage those creatures tended to survive whose accidental combination of parts was such that they were fit to do So.2 They could not, however, propagate their kind, as would be necessary for a truly evolutionary system. Not even the "whole-naturedi forms" of stage 3 could do that. In addition, stage 3 clearly does not depend on stage 2. Zeller saw this process of the development of organic life as a con- tinuous one, but most of the recent commentators have believed that I E.g. Bignone, E!npedocle, p. 450 et passim: masse integre. Diels-Kranz have rohgebal1te Formen, Zeller-Nestle unformliche Klumpen (16 987), Tannery formes indistinctes (Pour i'histoire de la science hellene p. 344). Similarly Holwerda (Comnmentatio de vocis quae est ?UGLq USU..., p. 69): "??XkV 9U0LM (fr. 63) significat 'membrorum globus horribilis' idemque designat atque oUiXocpu7q Trui7o, qui homo, ut e fragmenti versu ultimo apparet, incerti erat sexus." I do not find the examples persuasive by which Holwerda seeks to show (pp. 68-70) that ypu'at may mean not only statura, but also monstrum, masso, moles. These are -rirroL; It is clear from LSJ that ru7ro; is primarily a blow, then the impression made by the blow - a seal-impression, an engraving, or the like. It is used by extension of many kinds of "types", but always of a shape. Sometimes the shape may be vague or undetermined, but never shapeless. The word oXoqu'q is given the suitably ambiguous translation "whole-natured" by Burnet (EGP4 214, 243), and 1he is followed in this by Kirk and Raven (p. 3 3 8). Whether the root yp-here has the sense of "existence ", "being", "nature", or of "growth", the compound should mean something like "existing as a whole" or "single-growing". Simplicius' definition of it (Phys. j82. 17ff.) is clearly influenced by his general interpretation. The only authority cited by LSJ for the word from the classical period, other than Empedocles, is Aristotle PA 693 a 2 i, where Peck's tr-anslation is "one uninterrupted whole". 2 Ar. Phys. B [98 b 29; DK 31 B 6i. Cf. Simpl. Phys. 371.33. 142</page><page sequence="17">the four stages must be divided between two cosmic eras: the first two in that of the growth of Love, the third and fourth in that of the the growth of Strife.' Most, however, have avoided mentioning the absurd consequences for the detail of the system. It is reasonable enough to think of the development from scattered members to combined members as brought about by the influence of Love, and perhaps a case could be made for assigning the "whole-natured forms" to the period of Strife. But can we attribute to Empedocles the cynicism required to place the entire phenonmenon of generation by sexual reproduction, under the impulsion of Aphrodite, in the epoch of Strife - and indeed the latter part of that epoch, when the whole world is approaching disintegration? There is reason to believe he thought the present a period of Strife's growth, in the statement of Aristotle that "the world is the same now in the era of Strife as it formerly was in the era of Love" (De gen. et. corr. 334 a S; DK 31 A 42, B S3, B g4). But surely "the same" (to[Lco) is as significant a word here as "now" (v5v). He means that we have the same kind of world as then existed; and this is natural since both forces are at work in both periods. Zeller finds it a "surprising gap" in the system that Empedocles did not have more to say about the distinguishing character of each period; but, apart from the fragmentary nature of our tradition, there was not really much to say about the process of degeneration under Strife.2 I would suggest that in Empedocles' conception, the period of Strife's growing dominance saw the same four stages or types of organic "birth", but in reverse order. We have ample evidence that in this part of the cycle the elements cooperate less and less with each other. The constant tendency is to disintegration - from the perfect and intricate organisms we know, to forms that are "whole-natured" but much less complex, then to the "dream-like" monster forms, and last, just before the complete separation of the elements by Strife, when the combinatory influence of Love is very weak, to the pathetic "browless eyes" and I Zeller-Nestle 16 988 n. 2. 2 Ibid., 978f. We need not worry about the "Ausscheidung der Elemente aus dem Sphai- ros" (p. 979); Zeller himself, when he discussed the details of Weltbilding, noted that the separation ?x 7rp(cT-tY... T T(-'V CTOLt0LV XpXaeco4 (Ps.-Plut. Strom. ap. Eus. PE i. 8. 0 o; DK 3 I A 3 0) must refer to the beginning of Love's mixing activity. (xpioL4 would seem an odd word to denote the totally-separated world of Strife; but the whole phrase, including the late word cr-oLXrE:v reads like a generally-phrased introduction to the main part of the sentence, reflecting the summarizer's views). Aristotle is simply wrong in stating that Empedocles omits to discuss world-formation under Love (De caelo 30 I a 14; DK 3 I A 42), as Cherniss points out (Presocratics, p. 194). 143</page><page sequence="18">"neckless heads". If this is correct, the cyclical process might be graphically represented as in the diagram (p I 45). In a somewhat pessimistic spirit Empedocles diagnosed his own world as one of decay. Perhaps he thought he saw evidence of this in the increase of war or divorce or sterility, or even in an apparent increase in the incidence of monstrous births. A cyclical view of history is not necessarily pessimistic; according to temperament one may emphasize the sense of entrapment or the eventual improvement always ahead. Empedocles' doctrine of transmigration is surely inconsistent at one point with his cyclical physical theory, if fr. I47 is correctly interpreted as promising escape from the round of rebirth: "sharing with the other immortals their hearth and their table, without part in human sorrows or weariness" (tr. Kirk and Raven). This may, however, only refer to a temporary state. To be sure, &amp;O'cva'otc, seems unambiguous, but other passages suggest that Empedocles' attitude to mortality was rather un- usual. We read of "long-lived gods" in fr. 21. 12 and 23. 8, of the "springing up" of gods in fr. I46. 3 and in fr. 3S he clearly takes a favorable view of the growing power of Love, which brings forth the 0vex ~upto OvqTv as well as causing things to grow, as mortal, that "previously had learned to be immortal" (line 14). The aspect of the transmigration theory that appealed most to Empedocles was the kinship of all things, and this forms the rationale for his dietary restrictions, whatever religious or superstitious background they may have had (frs. 130, I36-i4i). There is not much about "sin", as a theological concept, in his thought, and the a&amp;?naxato by which the o[u[v may involve himself in the cycle of transmigration are moral or social rather than ritual: the shedding of kindred blood or the violation of an oath, and reliance on "raving Strife" (fr. I I E. 3, 14).' The highest human types or "lives", which one may go through before attaining the divinity and immortality of fr. 14K7, are those of benefactors of their fellow man: "and finally they come as seers and bards and physicians and leaders among men on earth. "2 The humanistic motive I This is of course not to deny that these concepts are frequently important in religious thought; but it seems misleading for Kirk and Raven (p. 35of.) to generalize this into a doctrine of "the primal sin and fall of man". 2 Fr. i46. 1-2. There seems slight warrant for rendering 7p6[Lot as "princes", giving a monarchist ring to this democrat's sentence. (Freeman, Companion p. I74, cites this line as showing "aristocratic bias"). It is a poetic word in which the etymological connexion with 7rp6 seems to have remained strong. According to LSJ it always is equivalent to r:p6,aoXoq in Homer. 144</page><page sequence="19">that led Empedocles to see as the ruling forces in nature Love and Strife, which are most familiar to us as forces in the life of man, is also the leading spirit of his physical philosophy.
