Hooker Received: 16 December 2007 / Accepted: 1 1 July 2008 / Published online: 27 August 2008 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008 Abstract The role of interaction in learning is essential and profound: it must provide the means to solve open problems (those only vaguely specified in advance), but cannot be captured using our familiar formal cognitive tools. This presents an impasse to those confined to present formalisms; but interaction is fundamentally dynamical, not formal, and with its importance thus underlined it invites the develop- ment of a distinctively interactivist account of life and mind. This account is provided, from its roots in the interactivist biological constitution of life, through the evolution of the dual internal regulatory capacities expressed as intentionality and intelligence, to its expression in self-directed anticipative learning in persons and in science.

At the least, it has proven attractive for those developing theories of cognition and epistemology to suppose this, for the solutions of well-defined problems can (often) C. A.

Yet both supposition and seeming are an illusion. The basic problems of life are always deeply ill-defined: How do I throw a good party? Win at tennis? Research this new domain? Become a mature adult? Have a stable democracy? ...In each of these cases we enter this world, individually and as a species, knowing neither the solution, or even good criteria for a solution, or methods for reaching a solution, or how to justify a solution, or even how to properly formulate the problem. Yet somehow we learn about these things. In this we are one with all creatures. From a biological perspective, the typical cognitive predicament of creatures is that of ill-definedness, that is, they face vague and ambiguous problems. How do I stay safe? How do I successfully feed myself?. . . Label these open problems, since they have no well-specified, rule-following resolution process. The predicament derives of course from ignorance: ignorance of what the environment is like, certainly, but equally of what creatures' bodies need and can do, and of what unrevealed possibilities there are in body-environment relations. The ignorance is deep; it is built into our body organisation, as when a moth cannot escape the flame. It is expressed cognitively, not just as lack of information to fill already well- defined categories, but as a lack of well-defined categories, problems, methods. . . The real power of intelligence is the capacity to transform such ill-defined open problems into ones better defined and increasingly satisfactorily solved. By comparison with that feat, solving already well-defined (in that sense, closed) problems, however sophisticated, is a derivative capacity, one largely concerned, not with intelligent creativity, but with a cluster of separate, lower order technical and managerial skills for using formal rule systems, managing already well-formed data, and the like. Using formal rules is trivial compared with inventing a useful system of rules and justifying it as appropriate to task completion, let alone with re-conceiving the appropriate task. Traditional artificial intelligence, which champions the use of formal computational rule systems, performs reasonably on (the less complex of) the closed problem tasks, but has failed to make significant progress in resolving the class of more fundamental, open ones that lie at the root of intelligence. This motivates a return to fundamentals, to understanding the most basic nature of intelligence. In doing so we must be concerned to avoid Brooks' 747 misdirection syndrome (Brooks 1991), that is, mistaking the superficial but easily understandable trappings of sophisticated flight, such as provision of seats, food and movies, for the unseen, not easily located, fundamentals of flight: Bernoulli-principle lift, plus thrust. As a roboticist, Brooks wished to avoid being misdirected by the superficial but easily understandable trappings of sophisticated intelligence, such as symbolic computa- tion, that had failed to deliver functionally intelligent robots. For understanding of the basic, underlying nature of intelligence Brooks turned to modelling insects, where the mechanisms are still primitive. Progress on some basic open problems - principally 'How do I find my way about in a constantly changing environment?' - was immediate.1 The striking feature of his competing-layers model is that it is based 1 However Brooks recognised that his specific layered insect mechanisms are not easily 'powered up' to encompass more sophisticated intelligences. He is now trying to move from insects to humans, with the risk fi Springer</page><page sequence="3">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 5 1 5 entirely on simple interactions, devoid of explicit symbols and computation (Hence the radical title of Brooks (1991): 'Intelligence without representation'.). The interactivist approach arose from multiple stimulants of this kind from robot- ics and neuropsychology to linguistics and philosophy and shares Brooks' naturalist, embodied, back-to-basics orientation. It seeks to provide a framework of basic, gen- eral concepts and principles within which to understand, not just intelligence, but all life forms and features. For that reason it begins at the beginning with single cells and builds from there. The approach is interactivist because of its emphasis on the funda- mentalness of interaction to all cognitive and proto-cognitive processes,2 also dubbed interactivist-constructivist3 to emphasise the increasing importance of internal regula- tory modification - that is, modification of internal interaction organisation, especially (but by no means solely) inter-neural interaction - in the adaptation of behaviour to achieve new modes of external interaction with the environment.4 The general features of the new approach are that it seeks to model life and mind as dynamical: primarily a natural manifestation of non-formal, non-digital, quantitative, non-linear dynamical processes, embodied: a natural manifestation of the requirements for maintenance of bodily existence, as interactive: primarily a natural manifestation of organised regulation of interactions, both organism-environment and internal inter- actions, and situated: as interacting in a context-sensitive manner.5 To this natural- ism adds that all capacities attributed to systems should be shown to be dynamically grounded, in particular that adaptive and cognitive capacities should arise from system processes which appeal only to dynamical processes actually available to the system. Anything else would be non-natural magic.6 Thus equipped, let us return to the issue of resolving open problems. Since the problem-defining process begins in ignorance, if we set aside supernatural interven- tion, it can only be resolved through the consequences of interacting with the world; this is why interaction is essential. Moreover, if all aspects of these problems are to be resolved together, the consequences of interaction must be profound; that is why characterising it properly is crucial. Whence, the consequences of interaction Footnote 1 continued that skipping over the intermediate evolutionary developments whose study his own erstwhile methodology commends may cause problems - see e.g. Brooks (1997), cf. Christensen and Hooker (2000b). This would certainly be true if, e.g., the specific forms the nervous system took during this development were crucial to cognitive organisation, as Moreno and Lasa (2003) suppose. 2 See The Institute for Interactivist Studies, http://www.lehigh.edu/%7einteract/index.html, cf. Bickhard (2005a). 3 See e.g. Christensen and Hooker (1998a,b, 2000a,b). 4 Here and elsewhere, I use 'interactivism' and 'interactionism' interchangeably and to name a doctrine about the universal primacy of interaction to all life, but Bickhard, e.g., takes interactivism to be an approach to cognition, and interactionism to be an approach to development - e.g., Piaget - and, in that sense, takes interactivism to force interactionism. 5 Thus our dynamical embodied interactive situated method is DEISM!, a reminder that naturalism is anti-dualist, but not crudely materialist or crudely reductionist, and that all methods are themselves fallible constructions. 6 Surprisingly, this rules out many common assumptions, e.g. that proper function for a system is given by selection etiology or that primary signal meaning for a system concerns the state of the sender since neither of these are system-available conditions.

In sum, the role of interaction in learning is essential and profound, but cannot be captured using our familiar formal cognitive tools. This presents an impasse to those confined to present formalisms; but interaction is fundamentally dynamical, not formal, and with its importance thus underlined it invites the development of a distinctively interactivist account of life and mind. The story begins with an interactivist-constructivist account of the basic nature of life as autonomy or recursive self-maintenance, a global constraint on the organ- isation of dynamical interaction processes that uniquely picks out the living systems from within the wider domain of complex, organised, non-linear, dissipative (entropy increasing) and irreversible, chemical and biological systems. The story then unfolds the evolution of cognition as the successive stages of autonomy-referenced, higher order, centrally neural, regulatory organisation of interaction, until contemporary human capacities are reached. It turns out that a certain class of self-directed processes, defined within this sequence, is able to resolve open problems and there is initial evi- dence that their development fits with the evolutionary record. Finally, the application of these ideas to science itself is considered and shown to lead to a fresh and funda- mental new understanding of how science progresses.7 2 Autonomy 2.1 The basic concept of autonomy The idea that there is something distinctive about biological organisation and that grasping it properly will provide important insight into biological processes, is one that has always been there in one form or another, from vital forces to low entropy acquisition (explained below). As right as the general idea has seemed, attempts to grasp it have met with the frustration of being either mysterious and/or circular 7 Technical aside. Since this paper speaks of order and organisation, their technical meanings are briefly characterised here. The root notion of order is that derived from algorithmic complexity theory: the ordered- ness of a pattern is the inverse of the length of its shortest, most compressed, complete description. Relational (redundancy or correlation) orders are determined by the minimal number of elements in which a redundancy can be detected: order n redundancy is detectable only over a minimum of 2n elements. Talk of high order features refers to features characterised by high order relations. (This is relatively independent of whether they concern highly ordered features.) Organisation is a particular kind of ordering involving relatively high order relations. Gases, being internally random, are disordered and hence unorganised but regular crystals, being internally uniform, are highly ordered though very simply organised because their global ordering relation is highly redundant. By contrast (roughly) machines and living things are organised because their parts are relatively unique and each plays distinctive and essential roles in the whole and hence they have high order correlations among them. That is, an organised system displays a non-redundant global ordering relation of relatively high order - though for this reason organised systems are less highly ordered than are crystals. A system's organisational depth is measured by the degree of nesting of sub-ordering relations within its global ordering relation (cf. cells within organs within bodies within communities). In these senses living systems are deeply organised, and have many very high order constraints, processes etc. The global autonomy constraint is one of these. On the principled dynamical characterisation of organisation see Collier and Hooker 1999 and references. £) Springer</page><page sequence="5">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 5 1 7 (vital forces) or too uninsightfully broad (low entropy acquisition). More recently, however, a promising approach has emerged, focussed around the distinctive inter- active organisation required for living agent-like capacity. Call this organisational requirement autonomy. Self-governance lies at the core of our commonsense conception of autonomy. However, we need to be wary of falling foul of Brooks' Boeing 747 syndrome: we are most familiar with the idea of autonomy as applied to persons and political governance, but these are sophisticated notions applied to sophisticated systems whose trappings may distract from fundamentals. We need to return to basic principles operating in all systems, especially in simple ones like single cells, to construct a naturalist interac- tivist notion that will 'grade up' across the evolutionary sequence to our sophisticated concept. Any finite system that maintains processes running within it must be open, irre- versibly taking in ordered or low entropy energy from its environment and exporting dissipated, less ordered or higher entropy energy to its environment.8 Finite, open systems at over-all dynamical equilibrium typically have many closed-loop processes running within them (and must have at least one), all driven by the degrading energy flow through them. Any of these processes may contribute to supporting themselves or others. For instance, a candle flame creates a thermodynamic asymmetry between itself and its environment, including an organisational asymmetry as it both pre-heats its own fuel supply (oil or wax) and creates a convection air current that delivers fresh oxygen to the flame. By supporting these two cyclical processes, the candle flame process contributes to the maintenance of the process temperature: in those partial respects it is self-maintenant (including of its self-maintenant capacity). But it has no self-regulatory capacity: should the flame die down it does not cause more oxygen and wax vapour to flow in to revive it, or cause a search to bring about delivery of other means to revive it (contrast hungry animals actively searching for food to revive themselves). The locus of regulation of these latter processes, if any, lies outside the flame process. Living beings from single cells 'up' are also among these open, irreversible, par- tially self-maintenant systems that maintain a state asymmetry with their environ- ment. But unlike the candle they display a self-regulatory capacity that is extensive and active. They actively search for, and intake, requisite ordered energy and materi- als (oxygen, water, nutrients - we call it eating and drinking) and excrete wastes and metabolically regenerate the whole of themselves in the process, all the while avoiding or ameliorating damage. Even single cells regenerate themselves metabolically from 8 The second law of thermodynamics informs us that every process dissipates its available energy to do useful work, that is, dissipates its ordered or low entropy energy, creating increasing system disorder or increased system entropy. In finite, dynamically stable systems the disordered energy leaves the system as radiation or ejected material. If the processes are to be maintained then there must be a compensating input of correspondingly low entropy, ordered energy. Hence the system must be open to both inputs and outputs. (Wastes could in principle accumulate within the system, but if it is finite there must come a time when these will disrupt the system processes. Similarly, the system may have a source of ordered energy within it, but if the system is finite there must come a time when that source is exhausted and this will disrupt the system processes.) £) Springer</page><page sequence="6">5 1 8 Synthèse (2009) 166:5 1 3-546 their intake of chemicals through their membrane and can chemotax up, or tumble to avoid moving down, a sugar gradient. While they do not regulate their overall environmental conditions (sugar, temperature), cellular self-regulation is otherwise complete - reconstructing all its components internally from intake of only elemen- tary chemical components (ions) - and active: through its own movement, it partially regulates its experience of its environment and its capacity to maintain itself. It is a model of self-regulation, including of active self-maintenance of its self-maintenance (recursively self-maintenant, Bickhard 1993). Multicellular animals perform the same overall tasks, only with an expanded range of self-regulatory capacities, for both internal interaction (e.g. the hormone regulated cardio- vascular resource delivery and waste removal system) and external interaction (e.g. neurally regulated sensory and neuro-muscular motor systems, etc.), to match their expanded regenerative requirements. Thus, beside their thermodynamic state asymmetry, all living organisms are marked by a strong regulatory asymmetry between them and their environment: the locus of living process regulation, while still incom- plete, lies more wholly within them and not in the environment. Birds organise twigs to make nests, but twigs themselves have no tendency to organise nests or birds. In all creatures, the environmental search for suitable intake chemicals is cyclic, speeding up when a deficit registers (e.g. as lowered osmotic pressure) and slowing down on satiation, generating the deficit (hunger): search (hunt): ingest: satiate: dissi- pate: deficit ... cycle. Similarly, underlying this the metabolic process moves through the deficit/damage, replenish/repair cycle (e.g. the cellular Krebs energy cycle) more or less actively as required to return functioning to normal. Moreover, the regeneration of the cellular processes thus delivered includes the regeneration of their interactive capacities, both their capacity to interact with the environment in food-acquiring ways and their metabolic capacity to repair damage. In sum, the autonomy of a system is its internally organised capacity to acquire ordered free energy from the environment and direct it to replenish dissipated cellular structures, repair or avoid damage, and sustain the very processes that accomplish these tasks. There are two broad cyclic processes involved, internal metabolic interaction and external environmental interaction, and these need to be coordinated: the environmen- tal interaction cycle needs to deliver energy and material components to the organism in a usable form and at the times and locations the metabolism requires to complete its regeneration cycles. The presence of these two thus synchronised cyclic processes resulting in system regeneration is the broadest functional sense of what is meant by a system's being autonomous (Fig. 1). Though the detail, especially the dynamical boundaries, vary in graded ways across living organisms, this autonomy requirement picks out all and only living individuals - from cells, to multicellular organisms to var- ious multi-organism communities, including many business firms, cities and nations.9 Autonomy is a subtle global constraint on the organisation (footnote 7) of interac- tion for whole organisms-in-their-environmental-context. Its metabolic cycle requires its constellation of interaction processes to so interrelate as to regenerate the whole of itself. While this global constraint is in itself permissive: no specific internal 9 See further Bickhard (2000); Christensen and Hooker (1998a,b, 2000a) and references. £} Springer</page><page sequence="7">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 5 1 9 Fig. 1 The coordination of cyclic processes MR (metabolic regeneration) and I (environment-system interaction) so that I delivers suitable kinds of resources at suitable times for MR to close constitutes autonomy and provides the most general characterisation of living systems organisation is specified, satisfying it will in fact involve many more local constraints, as each process' products must contribute to enabling other processes to proceed, that is, each process must partially regenerate the material constraints for themselves and/or others to work (self- or allo-regulation), requiring a highly organised web of process-constraint interdependencies or what Kauffman (2000) calls work-constraint cycles. Cells, e.g., exhibit several thousand simultaneous biochemical interactions so organised that between them they continuously regenerate the whole cell.10 When we compare their basic physical interactive properties with those of inanimate systems, the distinctive character of living interactive organisation stands out: Comparative system order Property System kind Gas Crystal Cell Cohesion None Rigid, passive Adaptive, active Directive ordering Very weak, simple Very strong, simple Moderate, very complex Constraints None Local Global Organisation None None Very high 10 We have as yet only a rudimentary understanding of the principles and details involved in such feats, albeit our understanding is currently increasing rapidly as systems/ synthetic biology develops, with many practical applications, at least at microbial scale, spurred on by the need to understand bio-synthetic pathways in order to connect new-found genetic knowledge to organism (phenotypic) outcomes.

For a sense of the integration required from genes to cognition see Miklos (1993). This is the kind of integration that marks the interactivist-constructivist approach to cognition taken by Christensen and Hooker (see footnote 36) and which will ultimately be delivered, if at all, by systems and synthetic biology. â Springer</page><page sequence="8">520 Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 A gas is dynamically cohesionless (i.e. it has no bound energy of interaction) and so it places no constraints whatever on its boundaries and no global directive constraints on its member atoms (i.e. energy is transferred randomly in space overall).11 While the molecular cohesion conditions of a crystal consist in local lattice molecular bound energy and exhibit strong directive constraints (e.g. energy propagation along crystal lattice faces), they too place no particular constraints on where its boundaries must be - if it is split the particularity of the crystal's identity is disrupted, but the result is two crystals with exactly the same type of cohesion properties as the original. The cohesion of an autonomous system, on the other hand, is global, it cannot tolerate disruption to the system's overall organisation. Cutting a cell in two typically does not produce two new cells, because the fundamental global process organisation that produces cell-type cohesion has been disrupted.12 2.2 Interaction, the primary focus of autonomy There have been a number of attempts to develop characterisations of the organisational basis of life related to the concept of autonomy outlined here, though there is con- siderable diversity in the details. Fong identified self-maintained and self-controlled systems as the key class for living systems and later attempted to characterise these distinctively in terms of thermodynamically grounded information principles.13 Based on cells as paradigm examples, Maturana and Varela present a theory of autopoeitic, or self-producing, systems that are said to be autonomous14 and Rosen (1985) develops a mathematical theory of self-repairing systems he calls metabolic-repair systems. 1 ' The essential idea of cohesion is that of a system dynamical constraint that is insensitive to relevant local variations (e.g. thermal fluctuations) in the system components (Collier 1988). For example, a kite has noticeable lift in a wind because the cohesion of its surface molecules (paper, cloth, etc.) successfully integrates the collisions with air molecules and transfers it to the frame. This is different in kind from the (weaker but still dynamical) communicational interactions that constitutes the cohesion of a flock of birds, and from the non-cohesive but correlated wave pattern formed in a boat's wake. Cohesion grounds both system properties and individuals (cf. Collier and Hooker 1999). Every dynamical interaction directs its interaction energy in specific ways in relation to the interactors involved. Even in elastic collisions, the least directive interaction, outgoing energy is confined to the plane determined by the incoming momentum vectors. In this sense every interaction has a spatio-temporal directive ordering. Here I use directive organisation analogously to refer to the organisation (footnote 7) of directed orderings that perform work in an autonomous system to direct energy fluxes from the environment into its cohesion-generating processes. 12 Clearly, autonomy is an emergent property of the cell as a whole. In fact, emergence is a ubiquitous feature of the far-from-equilibrium systems discussed in this paper. Though it suffices here to use the notion intuitively, a brief statement of its dynamical basis may assist understanding. Cohesion is constrained energetic interaction and emergence is a change in cohesion, specifically as expressed in a change in dynamical form (as opposed to simply change in dynamical state within the same dynamical form), see Hooker (2004). While an emergent change can consist in the dissolution of cohesion, as in an explosion, the changes of most interest to us are those constituted by the dynamical formation of a new dynamical constraint, which is self-organisation, as when autonomy emerges from chemical interactions. 13 See Fong's early papers (around the time or before Varela's and Rosen's seminal papers), reprinted as appendices to Fong (1996). 14 See e.g. Varela et al. (1974); Varela (1979); Maturana and Varela (1980); Maturana (1981), cf. the exploration by Etxeberria (2004). £} Springer</page><page sequence="9">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 52 1 Bickhard (1993) contrasts energy well and far-from-equilibrium systems, with those far-from-equilibrium systems whose identity is process-based, called self-maintenant systems. The constitutive processes of recursively self-maintenant systems actively support their own capacity for self-maintenance. The term 'autonomous agent' has entered artificial intelligence work on robotics and computer programing as those fields have come to increasingly emphasise adaptive, independent behaviour.15 How- ever comparatively little work has been done to develop and defend the application of the concept in these contexts (see Smithers 1995). Both Smithers (1995) and Ulanow- icz (1986) speak of a class of self-governing systems. No two of these notions is quite the same, nor the same as the conception of autonomy used here which, influenced especially by the interactivist orientation of Bickhard, was developed by Christensen and Hooker, with valuable input from Collier.16 More recently, this general approach has been enriched by Moreno and his colleagues.17 The differences among these notions may sometimes seem small but can have important consequences. Consider by way of illustration the difference between the autopoeitic (self-producing) and autonomy models. Both share the idea of self- regenerating cycles. However, the focus of autopoeitic analysis is on the process closures (the recurrence of initial conditions) that must be achieved to underpin cyclic regeneration, in particular on achieving global closure within the system itself. This orientation is revealed in the way that the examination of multicellular process organisation is confined to locating only repeated levels of the same closed autopoeitic organisation that applies to single cells (Maturana 1981). By contrast, autonomy, with its grounding in meeting far-from-equilibrium entropie process requirements, focuses on the effective mastery of increased interactive openness that will support more complex regulatory capacities. In any given circumstances, the closures necessary to regeneration must of course be achieved, but it is the successful expansion of inter- active competence that is the primary factor determining their form (e.g., and most simply, in determining whether it is plant or meat protein that is eaten). Consider, in this connection, the achievement of multicellular organisation. Mul- ticellular organisms differ in at least three important respects from single cells: they have (i) increased substitution of environmental construction for internal construc- tion (e.g. carnivores intake complex molecules, humans rely on environmental pro- duction of many essential amino acids), (ii) increased self-regulation of their food acquisition and damage avoidance (e.g. rapid or prolonged migration to track food resources, hiding or hole construction to escape predators) and (iii) increased capac- ity to self-regulate the modification of metabolism to suit both temporary activity (e.g. heart rate and blood re-direction for running) and permanent change (e.g. cal- lousing, neuro-muscular compensation for injury). In short, the emergence of mul- ticellular organisms represents a massive expansion in both interactive capacity and eventually self-regulation of that interactive capacity, and in this lies their rich adapt- abilities that make them so successful. The focus of understanding such evolution- 15 See, e.g., Beer (1995); Clark (1997); Maes (1990). 16 See, e.g., Christensen and Hooker (1998a,b, 2000a,b); Collier (1988, 2000, 2004). 17 See, e.g., Moreno et al.

(2000), Ruiz-mirazo and Moreno (2004). 4D Springer</page><page sequence="10">522 Synthèse (2009) 166:5 1 3-546 ary functional change should thus be, not on finding repeated levels of the same stringency of closed cellular autopoeitic organisation, but instead on the effective mas- tery of increased interactive openness. That mastery is achieved through increased self- regulatory capacity to modify, in situation-dependent ways, both the internal metabolic and external environmental cycles.18 That mind evolved from increasing self-regulation of interaction, provides a con- ception of mind that is (interaction coded and autonomy referenced, and this has important implications for its understanding. For instance, it is often enough sup- posed that the point of mind or intelligence is to correlate, or create a maximal cor- respondence between, internal to external conditions in a complex world. But in one important respect it is just the contrary. The point is to use environmentally appropriate action, certainly, but the purpose is to sustain autonomy invariant despite changing environmental circumstances, that is, to keep autonomy independent of, and hence uncorrelated with, environmental conditions. Conversely, organism-environment cor- respondence, when it does occur, is in itself no guide to adaptive achievement - it might concern only trivial correlations and even arise from environmentally induced damage (e.g. sunburn). Thus similarly, and contrary to correlational accounts based on linguistic reference or trait selection models, mind is concerned primarily with the extraction of invariant trans-contextual environmental patterns, conceived as, and formulated in terms of, autonomy-sustaining action guides; it is only derivatively and context-specifically concerned with achieving action correlated to the environment. In the autonomy perspective organism information is then modelled as reduction in downstream process modulation uncertainty, action semantics is constructed from the anticipated autonomy impacts of action, and intentionality is conceived as a high-order regulatory capacity for fluid, meaningful goal-directed management of interaction.19 These capacities are vividly evidenced in the massive expansion of interactive capacity through intelligence-funded tool use and thought that marks the advent of modern humans, their most recent manifestation being science-technology based self- regulation of internal (psycho-)medical intervention and external re-shaping of the environment, as well as less invasive interaction with both. 18 Cf. Christensen and Hooker (2000a). The detailed extent and role of higher order closures remain an open empirical issue. Moreno et al. (1997); Etxeberria and Moreno (2001), for instance, take certain kinds of functional closure as central to cognitive organisation in the spirit of the autopoeitic approach, citing certain empirical evidence and conceptual argument. If this position were to prove resilient to subsequent investigation, it will have to be built into the detail of the realisation of autonomy and, perhaps more importantly, into the organisation of intelligence. But this will not in itself disturb the main focus on the expansion of interactive self-regulation; nor, given the massive expansion of interactive capacity through intelligence-funded tool use and thought, do I see any prospect of the primacy of interactive expansion being challenged. Cf. Bickhard (1997). 19 For more discussion see Christensen and Hooker (2000b, Sect. 4) and (2002) and for extension to representation see Christensen and Hooker (2004); Bickhard (1993). Bickhard (2005a) includes a critique of Maturana and Varela's attempt to import an internal observer to their account, pointing out that with only closure and without the primacy of external interaction, such an observer has no fundamental cognitive perspective. The (inter)action orientation runs deep; for instance, Bickhard argues that the primary (and ultimately only coherent) conception of language is as a generative system of operations acting on the action states of recipients. See Bickhard (1980a,b); Bickhard and Terveen (1995). This is the 'Wright Bros' version of linguistic process, before a panoply of elaborations and other cultural uses is built into it, yielding the distractingly dazzling "Boeing 747* version we use take ourselves to daily use. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="11">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 523 2.3 Autonomous systems are (at least) elementary biological agents Entities with a distinctive wholeness, individuality and perspective in the world, whose activities are willful, anticipative, deliberate, adaptive and normatively self-evaluated, are properly treated as genuine agents. Autonomous systems are inherently all of those things. There is a continuum of strengths of agency and autonomous systems of one kind or another suffice to cover it. The elementary, base model is the single cell, the most primi- tive autonomous system. Beyond these lie more sophisticated multicellular organisms. Sufficiently centrally integrated multicellular organisms are in various degrees self- directed (see Sect. 3 below). Self-directing autonomous systems are inherently self- individuating, intentional and intelligent. They are biological agents of stronger degree according to their self-directing capacities. In what follows the bases for these agency claims will be very briefly explained. 2.3.1 Wholeness There is a distinctive organisational asymmetry between the autonomous system and its environment. Necessarily for any complex system, the self-regenerating processes are substantially internally regulated; hunting and eating, e.g., are initiated by inter- nal signals, and component activities (like running, or biting) are under neuro-motor regulation. The essence of the asymmetry is then that the directive organisation which induces the pattern-formation of physical flows from the environment into system- constitutive processes (and wastes out) is substantially endogenous to the system itself, and focussed on the regeneration of the system. Taken together with the global closure character of regeneration, autonomous systems evidence a distinctive whole- ness, a distinctive global integrity that identifies them as integrated internal wholes and differentiates them from their environment. This most basic feature is also cru- cial for properly grounding their agency: it is the basis for insisting that the proper referent for other agency characteristics is the whole agent. It is the agent as a whole that wills, anticipates, acts and so on. Modern tendencies to view the agent as a mere causal arena through which many causal chains or sequences run are corrosive of any coherent conception of agency; the wholeness of autonomous systems is the funda- mental basis on which this approach is to be rejected, and a naturalistic conception of a genuine agency reconstructed.20 2.3.2 Individuality Although aspects of the environment participate in the overall process-cycle in and by which an autonomous system is constituted, they require the system's directed processes to become channelled into system-regenerative processes. In this way the individual historical uniqueness of each agent's local environment is translated into a corresponding unique historical internal individuation of the autonomous system - the 20 For development of these latter themes see Campbell, in preparation and Skewes and Hooker (2008). £} Springer</page><page sequence="12">524 Synthèse (2009) 166:5 1 3-546 stronger the system self-directedness, especially learning capacity, the stronger the individuation. Thus the asymmetry of regulatory locus grounds the individuation of living systems in their own process coordination. In this way the biological conception of autonomy captures the root sense of self-governance, the leitmotif of the better known but more abstracted socio-political applications of the notion, and provides its ultimate ground. Individuation based on wholeness in this way provides an objective reference for attributions to a 'self (and will provide a genuine, if elementary, self when other attributes are added below). 2.3.3 Activity Such an autonomous system is inherently physically active, because it must capture physical energy from the environment and direct its flow into system-constitutive processes while expelling wastes if it is to replenish what has been dissipated and avoid damage from accumulating wastes. (Both dissipation and wastes are made inevitable by the second law of thermodynamics.) The system regeneration provides a coherent self-focus for the activity (For action, see below). 2.3.4 Willfulness A will is the capacity to do work (that is, transform energy) in relation to the self whose will it is. The constitution of the autonomy constraint, which focuses directive organisation on achieving self-regeneration, constitutes just such a distinctive capacity. When the cell opens ion gates to admit or emit chemicals it does work instigated by autonomy preservation and focussed on the regeneration of that same self. In more sophisticated organisms there is integrated high order regulation that provides a powerful realisation of willfulness in this sense.21 2.3.5 Normative evaluation Autonomous self-regeneration constitutes the fundamental basis for normative evalua- tion because it marks the emergence of a 'perspective': the focus on self-regeneration, and also an ultimate constitutive criterion: the continued persistence of the system as that individual, against both of which the outcomes of system processes are measured for success or failure. In single cells the measurement is directly continued exis- tence, autonomy satisfaction (life) or not (death). Multicellular systems have devel- oped many internal, partial and indirect surrogate indicators for autonomy satisfaction and its impending violation, often based around closure conditions for their important sub-processes, e.g. hunger (impending violation) and food satiation (satisfaction). Hunger measures departure from the blood sugar closure level, thus triggering the hunting-feeding process cycle, whilst food satiation measures the restoration of that closure level, terminating the process. It is these specific surrogate signals (cf. also thirst/fluid satiation, pain/pain-freeness) we think of as the basic, primitive norms 21 See Christensen (2006), cf. Moreno and Etxeberria (2005). £) Springer</page><page sequence="13">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 525 guiding behaviour, but they are literally grounded in turn in the obtaining of auton- omy, from which they derive their normative character. There may be also more general norm signals, such as generalised discomforts (aches, fears, etc.) and pleasures (physical, emotional and cognitive well-beings, etc.). Their presence can have many causes and they provide normative orientation, not to a specific condition or activity (blood sugar level, the way the elbow is moving) but to some larger, integrative functional aspect of autonomy obtaining. More sophisticated systems can also construct new surrogate norms in response to their experiences; e.g. a young cheetah learns from hunting failure (root norm: hunger) not to break cover too soon, acquiring an operational nearness norm for hunting. And creatures can modify normative relationships, e.g. suspending unconditional hunger-driven chasing to creep closer, or even suspending hunting entirely to protect cubs. In combination, this matrix of embodied norm signals - specific, general, constructed and relationally modified - allows a system to direct and evaluate its interaction processes with respect to their value for the system, providing it an elaborated normative perspective for interacting with the world and a corresponding sense of integrity.22 2.3.6 Action The willful performance of anticipative interactive activity against a normative eval- uation criterion provides a root sense of action. Situations are fundamentally differ- entiated by norms, the basic judgement to act taking the form This is an appropriate situation to satisfy norm N'. Beyond reflex behaviour situations are further differenti- ated by interaction: This is an appropriate situation to satisfy N by doing A'. They are also anticipative: they anticipate the norm satisfaction as their feedback conclusion (see below). These situation-action differentiations are implicit: they need no explicit labelling, association suffices (with room for explicit labelling in more sophisticated systems), general: all situations sharing this satisfaction association suffice for action A and, for that reason, potential: satisfying situations can be further differentiated through related interactive experiences, providing space for learning. 2.3. 7 Anticipation To anticipate is to act now in relation to some future state, event or process. Anticipa- tion is thus an integral feature of autonomous systems because of their need to interact with their environment in ways that achieve future closure outcomes that contribute to maintaining autonomy. The interactive relationship between the present action per- formed and the future, autonomy-evaluated outcome required is the most basic form of anticipation. 22 Here a fundamental ground has been provided for the emergence of norms in a world of facts. See further Christensen and Hooker (2000b, 2002). Of course a much larger story has to be told to capture the rich normative life we humans enjoy. For naturalists this will have to be a constructivist and realist story, in something like the way science is. For elements of this story see Bickhard (2002, 2005b); Hooker (1995, chapters 5 and 6). 4ll Springer</page><page sequence="14">526 Synthèse (2009) 166:5 1 3-546 The root notion of anticipative action for Rosen (1985) is that of a sequence of sub-actions that together achieve a closure condition and for which each sub-action exists only because it is a member of that closure-achieving sequence. Each element then anticipates the next and the sequence anticipates the closure outcome. While this is too broad to provide any distinctively agency sense of anticipativeness, since any cyclically regenerating system (e.g. a polymer) counts as acting anticipatively, it does capture the central functional character of anticipation. Elementary systems like single cells will only exhibit action sequences where what anchors the repeated activation of the elements is just their belonging to a closure-achieving sequence. A distinctively agency sense of anticipativeness emerges when Rosen's condition is applied to autonomous systems, since only these define a principled sense where it is the system itself that is anticipatory. There are three major aspects determining a system's anticipative capacities: the width of its interactive time window, the degree of articulation of the autonomy- related norms which it can use, and the order of the interactive relationships that it can effectively modulate. Between them, these features characterise the dimensions of intelligent/intentional capacity, and their roughly joint evolution traces the emergence of mind. Interactive time window. The root form of anticipation is action driven by distal perception, such as vision. As Smithers (1995) points out, distal perception allows systems to operate in relation to future environmental conditions because it provides information about those conditions (e.g. a bear running toward it) with which the system will interact in the future; it expands the system's 'interactive present' . Memory processes, conversely, provide a means to extend the interaction time- window into the past, allowing the system's interaction history to have a modulatory influence on its current state. Memory can also facilitate anticipation by generating expectancies concerning regular relationships in the system's interaction with the environment, e.g. in very simple conditioning processes such as the desensitization of a reflex. More complex memory processes can facilitate more detailed forms of anticipation, as in the case of neurally-based emulation (see, e.g., Grush (1997)).23 Emulation processes can range from relatively contextual and immediate motor signals to relatively more 'offline' imagination processes that can operate in the absence of overt behaviour. Imagination greatly enhances the capacity for dynamical anticipation by allowing the system to partially decouple its directive processes from the immediate context, permitting offline rehearsal and exploration of interactive possibility. The latter is particularly important, since opening up the capacity for modal anticipation permits high order cognitive processes such as resolution of competing goals and planning ability. 23 In many organisms neuronal systems involved in motor activity learn to emulate aspects of the dynamics of motor tasks such as reaching and grasping. These emulators are then able to supply context-appropriate directive signals more rapidly than is possible with sensory feedback loops. This process (also ubiquitous in control engineering) provides smooth and effective anticipative motor activity. â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 527 Normative articulation, The notion of an autonomous system's norm matrix has already been introduced; clearly, the more explicit norm signals are to the system the more its norm matrix can be elaborated and modified through learned construction and hence the more finely the system can guide itself through its world, tuning its anticipative orientation for more effective interaction with its environment. Modulatory reach. Similarly, the higher order the interactive relationships that it can effectively modulate, the more subtle and pervasive will be the environmental patterns which it can differentiate and hence the more powerful can be its anticipative actions. Compare here the anticipative reach of a frog that can only differentiate small flying objects in its immediate vicinity as food with a bird that can differentiate the behaviours of different bug species on different kinds of trees, diurnally, conditionally (such as following rain) and in their seasonal life-cycles [The discussion now returns to the next agent feature]. 2.3.8 Deliberateness The directed, anticipative character of action provides a root sense of deliberateness to action that is strengthened by the extension and focussing of anticipation as above, which also provides the basis for deliberation in anticipative action. 2.3.9 Adaptedness, adaptiveness An organism is adapted when it possesses an autonomy-satisfying set of traits in its life-environment. Conversely, an organism's ecological niche is comprised of the range of life-environments for which its traits provide satisfaction of autonomy. An organism's adaptiveness is its capacity to alter its specific traits in mutually coordinated ways so as to adapt to, that is, satisfy autonomy in, a wider range of life-environments. Humans can run as well as stand still and this enlarges the range of prey they can catch, predators and natural disasters they can evade, and social commerce they can sustain. Shifting from standing still to running involves coordinated changes in metabolic and blood flow distributions, heart rate, sensori-motor feedback/forward foci, etc. The set of coordinated trait variability ranges consistent with autonomy-satisfaction comprises an organisms' adaptive envelope, and its adaptability, adaptive potential, or adaptiveness is some measure of this set. 2.3.10 Information, semantics, intentionality Because of these properties autonomous systems can also be provided with informa- tional and semantic characterisations, to complete the sense of agency. For instance, organism information is modelled as reduction in downstream process modulation uncertainty ('Shall I do A or B? Given the result of my last interaction, B is the thing to do.'). This satisfies a traditional Shannon/Weaver measure, but here it is applied in a distinctively interactivist manner. Similarly, action semantics is con- structed from the anticipated autonomy impacts of action: the meaning of 4B is the thing to do' is along the lines that in this environment acting thus delivers norm-referenced £} Springer</page><page sequence="16">528 Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 autonomy-satisfaction of kind Sat(Aut, B). These conceptions of information and semantics grade back to the actions of single cells, though the stronger the self-directed, anticipative organisation involved the richer the semantic and informational struc- tures sustained. This is an interaction-centred semantics very different from, and more powerful than, standard linguistically modelled referential semantics. In this context intentionality is conceived as a high-order regulatory capacity for fluid, meaningful goal-directed management of interaction.24 2.4 The significance of autonomy If autonomy does indeed identify all and only living systems, as it seems to, then it is worthy of serious investigation. It provides, for instance, a principled basis for resolv- ing the basic question of which parts of our biosphere are properly live individuals - not hearts, swamps and tennis clubs, e.g., for all their complexity, but certainly all standard biological individuals and possibly some cities, some institutions (from households and firms to bureaucracies) and some communities and polities. It provides a principled basis for determining the units of analysis in cases of super-system hierarchies: single cells are the bedrock autonomous entities and the proper autonomy components of all multicellular systems, just as autonomous multicellulars are the minimal autonomous components of symbioses, communities and ecologies and humans are the minimal autonomous components of business firms and these are in turn autonomous compo- nents of cities, polities and so on. And it provides a principled basis for stating the Gaia Hypothesis, where present conceptions of partial self-regulation are too vague,25 as well as providing to exo-biology a principled definition of extra-terrestrial life that is not clearly too wide (as is, say, 'negentropy-capturing irreversible thermodynamic system') or too anthropomorphic (as is, say, * language-using humanoid'), where it presently lacks one. More generally, it provides theoretical biology with a distinctive foundational phe- notypic concept and constraint to counterbalance the present genotypic focus, one where the notions of bio-synthetic pathways and systems biology, just now coming into prominence, will act as a connecting bridge between autonomy's whole-individual level and that individual's component processes. It provides the reference conditions for adaptation and adaptiveness, and a principled basis for characterising ecologi- cal relationships, through systematising reproductive dependencies and by providing the reference constraint for niche determination and construction.26 Autonomy also 24 For instance, Bickhard argues that it resolves the frame problem, and is anyway ultimately the only coherent naturalist semantics, see e.g. Bickhard and Terveen (1995) and Christensen and Hooker (2000b, Sect. 4 and 2002) and text to footnote 37 below for further discussion. 25 See, e.g., Lovelock (1979) and http://www.wikiverse.org/gaia-theory-science. It seems to me unlikely that many, and perhaps not any, ecologies will prove to have the requisite organisational nature to warrant the epithet 'alive*, though they certainly demonstrate partial self-regulation. But this issue is ultimately to be settled empirically. 26 Roughly, a niche is a set of trajectories through a corresponding set of environments that leave organism conditions within the adaptive envelope, that is, which are consistent with autonomy preservation. Niche construction must meet these constraints. However, social relationships can both increase (cooperation) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 529 provides the foundational framework for agency (Sect. 2.3 above) and, since cognition arises as agent behavioural adaptive capacity, autonomy forms the basic framework for theorising cognition, and mind more generally (see below). Derivatively, it also provides a fundamental benchmark and research direction for autonomous, intelligent robotics, one related to, but significantly different in orientation from, to the prevailing disembodied computer model.27 However, autonomy also poses a distinctive challenge to biological theory. According to autonomy-based analysis the process organisation of biological sys- tems is central to understanding them, but neither evolutionary population dynamics nor ecological dynamics possess the resources to capture system organisation. These approaches have tended to focus exclusively on the study of emergent dynamical pat- terns, their critical bifurcation points and control parameters and the like, using as the fundamental framework dynamical modelling of differential equations (d.e.s) as fields on differential manifolds, e.g. on system phase space. But these modelling resources, powerful though they are for modelling the energetics of processes, do not explicitly describe the physical organisation of the system - a metabolic cycle and a pendulum, for instance, may be modelled as equivalent dynamical oscillators. In a phase space only the global dynamical states and their time evolution is specified, not the organised processes that produce the dynamics, hence it cannot capture directed organisation. There is at present no obvious resolution to the general theoretical problem of how to incorporate organisational principles into dynamical models in a principled way. In particular, global, spatio-temporally extended constraints, like autonomy, are at present not representable in d.eVphase space formalism. While autonomy, like any dynamical constraint, must in principle be representable as a limitation on system accessibility to dynamical states (namely, to those violating autonomy) and hence as a hyper-surface in system state space, there is at present no modelling methodol- ogy for constructing those accessibility limits for inherently global, spatio-temporally extended constraints, like autonomy. So while it is always possible to capture the dynamical consequences of internal organisation by modelling system+environment as a system of coupled component subsystems, there is no principled, internally moti- vated basis for reversing the process to extract organisation from the dynamics, that is, for individuating the system in a principled way. This is as much a challenge for theoretical robotics as for theoretical biology. Dually, the challenge posed to practical construction and regulation/control in biol- ogy and robotics is equally deep because, if autonomy-based analysis (including of autonomy-based cognition) is even roughly correct, it provides a set of organisational requirements for this task that will prove far from simple to meet. For instance, despite using the label 'autonomous agent', there are at present no truly autonomous robots in this biologically based sense. Robotics uses a very limited formal notion of autonomy (something like invariant dynamical form) and performance criteria (typically confined to a single task) and an equally limited satisfaction method. This is as yet very far from Footnote 26 continued and decrease (competition) the range that would otherwise be available to lone organisms. For an initial statement and analysis see Hooker (2002) and for niche construction see Laland et al. (2000). 27 For some further discussion see Christensen and Hooker (2000a, 2002). £) Springer</page><page sequence="18">530 Synthèse (2009) 166:513-546 even incorporating normative signals into the bodily coherence of robots, let alone the complexity required for self-regeneration and the capacity for fluid management of multi-dimensional environmental and internal interaction processes in relation to that. Similar constraints currently apply to our capacity to understand, much less synthesise, biological systems. Despite calls for the simulation of biological autopoietic cells, we remain far from being capable of doing so.28 These challenges do not subtract one whit from the actuality and importance of the autonomy constraint in the scheme of things, but they do make painfully clear the limitations of our current knowledge (and perhaps the consequences of focusing C20 research attention too exclusively on genetics). 3 Autonomy and cognition 3.1 Sophisticated epigenetic regulation and evolutionary process In Part 2 the primacy of interaction led to a conception of evolution as an explo- ration of expanding interactive competence, internally as higher order regulation and externally as niche construction. The single cell was presented as a model of internal self-regulation and self-maintenance of its self-regulation, while multicellular organ- isms perform the same overall tasks, only with an expanded range of self-regulatory capacities, for both internal interaction (e.g. the hormone regulated cardio-vascular system) and external interaction (e.g. neurally regulated sensory and neuro-muscular motor systems, etc.), to match their expanded regenerative requirements. Here this theme is briefly abstracted and generalised as the proposition that evolution represents the successive exploration of increased phenotypic regulation of the root evolutionary process: variation, selection and retention [VSR]. VSR is the general form that all genuinely creative adaptive processes must take, including cognition, because it is the essential form of self-organisation with fluctuations represented by an uncontrolled V.29 The S and R components are material requirements for process closure. (See also Bickhard (1993).) VSR with system uncontrollable fluctuations (V), from which one is amplified (S) and fixed (R) as explicit system cohesion, is self-organisation with increased system 'usable' order (footnote 12); VSR with V regulated so that system 'usable' order remains constant is re-organisation. In the standard neo-Darwinian conception, the process of evolution is representable by a VSR process in which all three components are uncontrolled by the affected sys- tems. Variation, though an endogenous process, is not regulated because it is random genetic mutation. Selection is either death of, or reproduction of, the phenotype and, although deterministic, is nonetheless uncontrollable because it is exogenously deter- mined by the environment. Retention appears as altered gene frequencies and, though again endogenous, is uncontrollable because it is a supra-individual populational out- come of selection. Call this VSR process Simple Darwinian Evolution (SDE). 28 For further discussion of robotics see Christensen and Hooker (2002). On cell simulation see footnote 1 0. 29 Here the colloquial "uncontrolled" = neither controlled nor regulated, in the technical senses of those terms (see footnote 33). £l Springer</page><page sequence="19">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 53 1 By contrast, systems with more sophisticated regulatory capacities bring, to varying degrees, each of V, S and R under significant epigenetic regulation. In varying degrees, such organisms significantly regulate (i) their own development, both physiological and cognitive/behavioural, (ii) the structure of their environment, both natural and social, and, through both, (iii) their behaviour, including their reproduction. This epi- genetically regulated shaping of endogenous capacity and exogenous social and natural environment is a capacity to (partially) regulate the VSR process. Epigenetic regula- tion of effective variation (V), that is, of variation available to create differential repro- duction, is ubiquitous since sophisticated individuals are not effectively presented for reproduction unless they have had viable embryogenèses and social developmental tra- jectories, both of which are (partially) epigenetically regulated (respectively through in-utero embryological, and ex-utero social, processes).30 Epigenetic regulation of effective selection pressure, S, is equally ubiquitous. Creatures that actively modify their own environment, typically in proportion to their (socially amplified) capacities, thereby modify the selection pressure which they experience. (A river bank full of platypus burrows is a friendlier environment than one without.) Similarly, creatures that actively modify themselves and/or their community structures so as to increase survival skills (for instance, through enhanced individual or group hunting or fight- ing skills) thereby modify the selection pressure that they experience. And access to reproduction may also be significantly modified by social factors, for instance through pecking orders, and through environmental modification, e.g. through nest mound building. All of these processes are under (partial) individual and/or social regulation. Finally, the inheritance of reproduction, R, is at least socially regulated through such practises as abortion and infanticide, which are again under individual and/or social regulation.31 Call this overall process of multiply regulated VSR, Complex Organised Darwinian Evolution (CODE). 30 Amplification cases include regulation of litter sizes for kangaroos, timber wolves and other species as functions of competition for food, or creating multiple births where there would have only been one or two (as in human IVF and cloning technology), or by prolonging the life of non-viable individuals (e.g. genetically deficient individuals) until reproductive age or by extracting their juvenile sperm or ova and utilising it for reproduction, or by biased mutation directions and/or rates in fertilised ova where regulation is either exercised endogenously to the individual (cf. Sarkar 1990) or produced through socially regulated technologies (radiation, molecular genetic manipulation). Filtering: Those individuals whose genetic arrangements do not permit them to so develop as to have a coherent global functional organisation (eg., not to have a properly functioning heart or liver, or who have an insufficiently formed or adaptive immune system etc.) simply do not survive to develop into the mature reproductive adult form. Further, those individuals who, surviving to birth, nonetheless present characteristics which make them socially non- viable (whether because of their unwanted skin colour or their incapacity to digest the socially recognised foods, or simply represent over-crowding, as in rats, or whatever) again do not survive to develop into the mature reproductive adult form. All this represents regulation of those variations which are presented for exogenous environmental selection, regulation that is endogenous to either individual or social group. These same processes can also be regarded as modifying retention if they are considered as ways to bias the numbers of surviving genes from one generation that are subsequently embodied in the next generation. The sharp classification of these processes depends on drawing a boundary between retention and subsequent variation, but the nature of the complex feedforward and feedback processes here evidently prevents doing so. 31 This analysis makes it clear that a general organisational locus of regulation, like social filtering, may apply to all of V, S and R, and conversely a process locus, like V, can be regulated from all organisational loci, internal, social and environmental. £) Springer</page><page sequence="20">532 Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 From this perspective SDE is a degenerately simple form of CODE, essentially omitting phenotypic interactive capacities.32 SDE assumes the appearance of a pheno- type for every genetic variation, abstracting away the developmental process, assumes an achieved reproduction rate, abstracting away the organism-society-environment interaction, and assumes reproduction retained, abstracting away the individual and social response to fertilisation. But in practice none of these suppressed factors can be ignored. SDE approximates best in the case of organisationally shallow systems where phenotypic interactive capacities are minimised, thus populations of isolated single cells (but not slime moulds), and becomes progressively less appropriate as phe- notypic organisation increases. Understanding CODE processes involves recognising the complex ways in which effective V, S and R come under increasing endogenous regulation as organised individual and/or social interactive capacities increase and the regulatory locus of evolutionary dynamics shifts increasingly from genotype, with a simple selection-driven environmental determinism (the 'thin phenotype' model), to a multi-focal process regulated at genotype, individual and social foci with genetic structure increasingly buffered from selection (the 'thick phenotype' model).33 32 A degenerate idealisation is a restrictive constraint condition on a class of theoretical models such that essential structure is irreversibly lost and cannot later be recovered by adding 'correction factors' to the idealised models, see Hooker (1994b). Note for systematic interest that Lamarckian evolution is a special case of CODE-evolution, endogenously driven so that later retention remembers earlier acquired characteristics; since, unlike SDE-evolution, it is a non-degenerate case it needs to explicitly specify the memory mechanism. While there is an important barrier in the case of direct feedback from cellular function to cellular genotype (the Weismann barrier) we can now appreciate that there are many alternative forms of its partial expression through other, less direct, channels of endogenous regulation - see e.g. Jablonka and Lamb (2005); the nature and importance of these in CODE-evolution is an empirical matter. Cf. here Piaget's much mis-understood position, see Hooker (1994a). 33 This position offers those enamoured of a simpler selection model ample opportunity to reach unwar- ranted conclusions. For instance, regulatory loci are not control loci and neither are they selection loci. Modulation is simply influencing output variation through varying some input, while regulation is the pro- duction of dynamic equilibrium through response to output variation, typically through negative feedback, and control is the stronger requirement that the equilibrium be normatively specified by a reference signal accessible to the controller with the response a function of departure from reference. Modulators need not be regulators and regulators need not be controllers, but simply contribute to dynamical equilibria. An autonomous system is typically self-modulatory in important respects and self-regulatory in others, and may be self-controlling where norm signals are present. No one locus, nor even all loci together, are likely to control the evolutionary process and will likely only partially regulate it, with many more modulating it. Second, selection is a filter, a device that extracts a subset (the 'passes') from the remainder (the 'failures'), and this function is neither necessary nor sufficient for being a regulator. Thus vexed issues like the role of group selection are distinct from the claims made here about process regulation. With respect to the related issue of the role of non-linear pattern formation and self-organisational con- straints in biological dynamics (cf. e.g. Kauffman 1993), the relative force of selectionist (S) and organisa- tional (O) constraints in accounting for the organisation of living systems depends on how tight the respective constraints are; tight O constraints (few forms of organism possible) leaves selection little to do but push the evolution of forms along and fine tune the variable details, loose O constraints leaves most things to selection (cf. Ahouse 1998). The empirical evidence evidently points to a largely intermediate situation in which both types of constraints are explanatorily significant factors, but this varies in multi-dimensional, quantitative, and so to-be-empirically-decided, ways. More importantly here, it is the functionality of the resulting organisms that is important, not their origins (etiological and/or organisational), see Christensen and Bickhard (2002). £} Springer</page><page sequence="21">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 533 3.2 Sophisticated epigenetic regulation and cognition VSR regulation is the most abstracted form of the exploration of the organisational design space of autonomous systems. Less abstracted is a characterisation of explo- ration in terms of successively more sophisticated, but still general, kinds of functional organisation. Two key organisational steps toward human cognition are the functional capacities of self-directedness [SD] and self-directed anticipative learning [SDAL] (Christensen and Hooker 1998a, 2000a,b). These capacities are characterised by an increasingly sophisticated regulation of error feedback that constitutes an internaliza- tion of the VSR process (Bickhard 2001, 2002).34 Still less abstracted is the investi- gation of the evolution of 'bauplans' for sophisticated organisms and their potential cognitive significance (Moreno and Ruiz-Mirazo 1999; Moreno and Lasa 2003), and more specific again is the investigation of integrative neural regulation and its evo- lution pursued by Christensen (2004, 2006). While neither of these latter studies are pursued here, they are where the bulk of detailed empirical realisations of interactivist organisation will be revealed (or not) and, though there is initial empirical support for the abstracted conception presented here,35 they are where the precise sense in which it is a valid approximation to reality will be determined. There follows brief accounts of the SD and SDAL capacities and their place in cognition. In particular, it is shown how SDAL resolves the problem posed in Sect. 1 concerning the process of solving open problems. While all living systems are autonomous, sufficiently primitive systems respond stereotypically to their environment, but more sophisticated systems can shape their behaviour to suit their circumstances. The basic dimensions to this shaping capacity are the capacities to (i) dynamically anticipate the interaction process, (ii) evaluate interaction using normative signals and (iii) to modify interaction in the light of (i) and (ii) to obtain autonomous closure. Successful adaptive shaping is problem solv- ing and these are the ingredients from which cognition is formed. There is no single 'mark of the mental', instead there is a group of capacities that become specialised in various ways through evolution over the long run and, as regulatory sophistication increases, also increasingly during individual development (using, as noted, individ- ually and communally regulated VSR processes). Organisms with this three-factor shaping capacity are self-directed', they are directed because they are thereby pow- erfully organised to direct interaction into autonomy satisfaction, and self-directed because these are internal processes and their locus of regulation lies primarily within the organism itself. 34 Regulation by anticipative interaction error surrogates in advance of actual error has obvious advan- tages and environments that favour sophisticated anticipation (for instance, where learning subtle patterns and detecting them early offers large rewards) will support the kind of macro-evolutionary trend toward increasing abilities to learn and to learn to learn that we see in (at least) the mammalian line and that use increasingly sophisticated detection of error in doing so (cf. Bickhard 1980b; Bickhard and Campbell 1 996). Hooker ( 1 995) characterises rationality as a self-regulatory error detection process. Bickhard (2002) proposes that rationality in a broad sense is precisely this internalization of VSR processes. 35 See, for instance, the coincidence-prediction neural circuits underlying self-directedness in bumble bees discussed in Christensen and Hooker (2000b), cf. (2004). £} Springer</page><page sequence="22">534 Synthèse (2009) 166:5 1 3-546 Though they seem to aim at biting us, blood search interaction in mosquitos is simple and stereotypical (see Klowden 1995), confined to local responses to chemical gradi- ents, with no mechanism for anticipating the outcome and no evaluation of behaviour against its impact on autonomy, and thus unmodifiable. Mosquitos are not self-directed. By contrast in cheetahs we see the integration of evaluative and contextual informa- tion with powerful anticipation to produce fluid goal-directed hunting interaction. The cheetah selects appropriate prey - young or weak animals are preferred - adapts the hunting technique to the context, e.g. using cover during stalking, and responds flu- idly and anticipatively to prey behaviour, such as exploiting dodging bias to reduce flight effectiveness (see Eaton 1974). Because cheetahs differentiate many kinds of such variables and anticipate their influence on hunting they are able to act fluidly and appropriately in a complex and changing context. Cheetahs are powerfully self- directed hunters. These differentiations concern interactive characteristics (alertness, speed, agility, aggressiveness, etc., relative to the cheetah's behaviour) and they are only acquired through an extended interactive learning process. Learning is central to powerful self-directedness since, being so complex and situation-dependent, it is unfeasible to genetically encode what a cheetah needs to know to hunt successfully. Thus, unlike mosquitos, a cheetah cub lacks most of the skills required for hunting and must acquire them through learning in practice. These factors, such as not breaking cover too quickly and isolating a prey from its herd, only become relevant because the cheetah has the capacity to both discriminate these complex relational aspects of its environment, to recognise success and failure, that is, to evaluate its actions, and use that evaluation to modify its anticipative behaviour in relation to the discriminated features. Its thus- learned hunting framework involves constructing both a norm matrix (comprised of learned norms, such as not breaking cover too soon) and a complementary anticipa- tory model of prey behaviour, together with a process for fluidly combining sensory, kineasthetic and evaluative inputs to form rapid modulation of hunting action 'on the run'.36 Bumble bees are simple self-directed agents, since they can learn which flowers cur- rently offer the best nectar rewards by evaluating the results of their flower searches. But they cannot learn to anticipate flowering patterns (e.g. by species, season and location), or modify or extend their operative norms, or modify their learning strat- egy. Cheetah cubs can do all of these things. Christensen who first identified this self-directingly interrelated cluster of higher order capacities, labelled it self-directed anticipative learning [SDAL] .37 Another more sophisticated example is that of a detec- tive conducting a murder investigation. The detective uses clues from the murder scene to build a profile of the suspect and then uses this profile to further refine the direction and methods of the investigation. (A receipt may be enough to re-direct the search 36 Cf. Hutchins (1995). The emphasis on high order fluid modulation of process within a globally organised normative and anticipative action framework is not mere style but has important consequences for modelling mind and action - see especially Christensen and Hooker (2002 and 2000a Part IV, 2004). For an account of proxy/ideal goal construction and its fundamental role see Hooker (1995, chapter 6). 37 See Christensen (1999); Christensen and Hooker (2000a,b, 2002). The particular synergism of this converging cycle of improvement was a refinement of its preceding convergence models, see Hooker (1989, 1995, chapter 4). â Springer</page><page sequence="23">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 535 from lovers, using personal network construction methods, to business creditors, using financial analysis.) The profile tells the detective what the murderer is like and what types of clues to look for. This in turn sets new intermediate goals that focus the inves- tigation. If the profile is at least partially accurate the modified investigation should uncover further evidence that in turn further refines the search process, ultimately (hopefully) culminating in capture of the murderer, and revealing how and why the crime happened. It is the interplay between the discovery of clues, the construction of a suspect profile and subsequent modification of the anticipative investigation strategy that provides the process its self-directing power. There is a virtuous feedback circle here, for as the cheetah gets better at differen- tiating the relevant factors in effective hunting it not only becomes better at hunting (e.g. better able choose circumstances in which to hunt) it also becomes better able to recognise sources of error in its hunting technique and hence improve it. Similarly for the detective. Each learns how to learn better in the process of learning how to do better. SDAL uses interaction to acquire information about the nature of the task as well as the specific performance to hand, and thereby improves performance. Just this is the virtuous bootstrap that must be behind every capacity to solve what in Sect. 1 were called open problems. When successful, SDAL results in a pushme- pullyou effect as learning is pushed forward by the construction of new anticipations and pulled forward by the environmental feedback generated, creating an unfolding self-directing learning sequence. Because of its characteristic self-improvement SDAL can begin with poor quality information, vague hypotheses, tentative methods and without specific success criteria, and conjointly refine these as the process proceeds. This makes SDAL powerful because it allows successful learning to arise in both rich and sparse cognitive conditions. Hunting by cheetahs, detectives and the like provides examples par excellence of systematically focused behaviour, every system coordinated to deliver an anticipated outcome. It is that systematic focus on a future goal that provides a forceful presenta- tion of intentional behaviour. Now we can see that this intentionality is realised, not in a specific, isolated capacity, like linguistic reference, but in self-directedness, an encompassing high level multi-factor organisation of interaction, evaluation and antic- ipation. It is most powerfully expressed in SDAL focused on resolving open problems (Christensen and Hooker 2002). On this approach to intentionality, cognitive ref- erence arises through these interactive differentiation processes, not prior to them. Specifically, as part of the problem of coordinating complex interaction processes, self-directed agents learn to differentiate specific states-of-affairs, objects, and object types and they do this by learning the effects these things have on interaction processes and in turn on their autonomy condition, as indicated by their norm signals. Thus the account presented here is closer in spirit to Merleau-Ponty 's 'grip' than to the dominant Brentano-esque primacy of language-like reference.38 Science also illustrates these features, for the researcher is closely akin to the detec- tive. Deeply original research, such as entering the quantum domain from classical 38 See Merleau-Ponty (1962); Brentano (1960). Contrary to Brentano, linguistic reference becomes a sophisticated construction growing out of these more basic forms (cf. Bickhard, footnote 19), a result more in keeping with its recent origin. £) Springer</page><page sequence="24">536 Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 physics, also confronts the researcher with an open problem because, not only is the detail of what is there and how it operates not known, it is not clear even what cate- gories of thing and their operation may be relevant, what kind of theory will be needed, where existing investigatory methods will remain valid, what criteria for validity to apply, or even how to formulate proper questions. Researchers behave like detectives: they search for features that might provide useful clues, evaluate their significance against known criteria, build a tentative theory of the situation (a profile) on that and decide a tentative methodology; they then rely on favourable feedback from experi- ment to refine these and so close in upon the real nature of the problem and its proper categories, theory and methods. From amoeba to mosquito to cheetah to human there is an enormous elaboration of all of the facets of directed interaction and of their overall organisation. Across this development both intelligence and intentionality grow in strength as dual aspects of the increasing power of self-direction, two complementary aspects of the elaborating management of interaction. 3.3 Sophisticated epigenetic regulation and scientific cognition First the application of the ideas of Sect. 3. 1 to the sciencing process are sketched and it is shown that science exhibits very powerful forms of regulation of its VSR processes, a CODE process with SDE the simplified version. Second, evidence is reviewed for the idea, briefly broached above, that the more specific cognitive form of this process is SDAL cycling. These unorthodox, but interaction management oriented, process descriptions of science provide a new way to understand the cognitive organisation of science, one that is both thoroughly dynamical and embeddable into its social process setting. 3.3.1 Regulated VSR processes in science First, V regulation. Endogenous scientific regulation of effective variation in method and theory is ubiquitous since such proposals are not effectively presented for testing unless they have already passed a stringent series of filters applied during their devel- opment and unless they interrelate with the viable methods and theories around them in an appropriately fruitful manner. For instance, except in rare cases where there is very good reason (itself a strong filter), those theoretical proposals that require the viola- tion of entrenched principles, or that contradict surrounding theories, or do not readily yield testable empirical models cooperatively with these theories, are never developed to the point where they become candidates for being put to testing. The same applies for variation in instrumental features or use and other aspects of experimental design and technique, and in methodological processes generally. This represents individ- ual and/or communal scientific regulation of those variants which are presented for selection. Second, S regulation. Scientists actively modify the environments within which their methods and theories are tested and this profoundly affects the selective forces they experience. A theory is tested in a situation where key variables are carefully £} Springer</page><page sequence="25">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 537 regulated (typically to values that vary sensitively with features under test) and the behaviours of the variables to be measured are sensitively monitored with specially designed instruments. This shaped, pre-selected environment profoundly shapes in turn the categories and ranges of signals which will be accepted as feedback from reality in testing theories and some signals will be taken to bear strongly on the theory, others to have no or indirect bearing. But the same situation equally tests the valid- ity of methods, with complementary guidance from accepted 'background' methods and theories, and often also the theory under test. In this way science exhibits a deep endogenous regulation of the selective force experienced by methods and theories.39 Conversely, scientists have actively modified themselves through training and task selection so as to avoid environmental situations in which they are in danger of pro- ducing unreliable results. Finally, the raw experimental information, = instrumental behaviour, which results is subject to fastidious mathematical re-shaping to discrim- inate signal from bias and noise before any scientific data emerges. The converse of sophisticated bias and signal/noise distinctions is a sharpened conception of error, both of its division into kinds (random and systematic) and sources (unmodelled interactions - endogenous and exogenous, design/ assumption defects, human behav- iour) and, most importantly, of where and how to search for errors and how to correct them when discovered. Thus we have multi-dimensional endogenous regulation of selection. This extremely complex theoretical and methodological regulation of experimen- tation functions as a very high order and powerfully self-directing dynamic filtering process. Its complexity and interactivity - the source of 'theory-ladenness' in sci- entific observation - is, as it is in perception generally, precisely what is required to isolate very subtle environmental regularities amidst the vast sea of environmental and human-originated signals in the experimental milieu. Thus, placed in its proper process setting, 'theory-ladenness' is seen, not as idiosyncratic and problematic for scientific coherence, but as an expression of its cognitive power.40 Indeed, in its increasingly competent self-directing development, science is transforming the role of human per- ception within it (perception is being instrumentally extended, and replaced, and its deliverances methodically corrected, and it is also being biologically modified) even while the use of perception is contributing decisively to the development of the very technologies involved and to many others besides (a larger, crucial, SDAL process).41 39 This is not to say that an anomalous experimental signal will not ultimately have its effect, but initially it will be set aside as anomalous and investigated as an artifact of the experimental arrangement. Here it may prove to be the basis for correcting flawed experimental method, but this investigation too will be strongly regulated by what are judged reliable methods. Only if this fails to be confirmed, and there is reason provided that it should be pursued as a genuine signal rather than set aside as spurious, that is, only under further strong scientific regulation, will it make an impact on theory. In sum, all selection impacts are strongly regulated. 40 There are two other ingredients in the making of 'theory-ladenness' problematic, (i) a wrong approach to semantics which leaves theories semantically closed, and (ii) a naive model of scientific unity as deductive axiomatisation. Both of these are naturally corrected within the present framework; for the roots of a realist interactive semantics see Christensen and Hooker (2000b, 2002, 2004), and for a corresponding biologically-rooted notion of unity see Hooker (1998). 41 More generally, science and technological practice at large must be seen as an intimately interact- ing collection of societal sub-systems, each feeding into and upon the other and ever more intimately £) Springer</page><page sequence="26">538 Synthèse (2009) 166:513-546 Third, R regulation. Scientists have elaborately constructed institutionalised pathways that profoundly affect the way successful methods and theories are retained and propagated. Playing both filtering and amplifying roles, the highly organised dynamics of information propagation in science are critical to its social cohesion and its cognitive development. University seminars, refereed journals, textbooks, email discussion lists, conferences, etc., provide differentiated institutional mediums facil- itating and organising the transmission of ideas and methods. Within that, the prop- agation dynamics is still more highly organised. Successful ideas and methods do not propagate universally but into highly selective contexts where their approxima- tions and their particular parameters and mathematical techniques can be fruitfully combined with others that exist at those active working sites. For instance, a success- ful quantum macro molecular model in solid state physics might reappear at some locations in macro-molecular chemistry, others in molecular biology, still others in process engineering, electronics and even economic price series analysis, but nowhere else. Further, these retention processes are strongly biased; some proposals, or even components of them, are subject to many alternative variants and their consequences carefully explored, while other ideas and methods, or components of them, are simply allowed to run in their present form. Taken together, this guided retention amounts to the widespread self-directing modification of scientific inheritance. All of these activities are deeply theory- and practice-laden and it is precisely this that gives the process its self-directing focus and cognitive power. An important part of their global self-directedness is to deliberately search for hitherto unnoticed errors by ensuring that the widest possible, but fruitful, unification is created to bring to bear all new learning on each local focus and by constantly testing success with the new bold conjectures this suggests. In sum, in those very aspects that are distinctive to its mode of operation, science represents the profound development of endogenous, self-directing regulation of its VSR learning processes. As such, the contemporary sciencing process represents a good example - perhaps the most sophisticated example we humans possess - of the characteristic form that CODE processes take among complex and deeply organised systems.42 3.3.2 SDAL cycling processes in science In Sect. 3.2 SDAL was illustrated using a detective's open problem resolution pro- cedure as example and attention was drawn to the obvious parallel with a research problem and procedure. Modelling science as an SDAL process involves identify- Footnote41 continued interconnected as economic complexity and scientific self-directedness develops. See Hooker (1995, chapter 1 ) and ( 1 987, chapter 7) for various aspects of this dynamics. By the same token sciencing processes will be found in varying degrees of concentration and power/perfection throughout society, scattered across commercial R&amp;D sites, government agencies, consulting firms, etc. as well as universities, while much activity in all these institutions will not count as scientific; the principled cognitive divisions are among types of social processes, not among social institutions. 42 Now evolutionary epistemology can be re-defined as the theory of the cognitive dimension of the CODE process. This is in contrast to the common practice in evolutionary epistemologies of taking SDE as the basic process form, whereas it in fact provides only the degenerate 'outer form' of the learning process. £) Springer</page><page sequence="27">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 539 ing a relevant class of interactive tasks and the anticipative and evaluative processes by which the tasks are achieved.43 The idea is to understand scientific activity as a self-directed learning process in which the research profile (cf. the detective's crime profile) is itself modified and articulated during the learning process through exper- imental interaction that reveals information that could not have been anticipated by earlier conceptions of the issues. Cycles of such interaction hopefully lead to increas- ingly refined identification of contextual and evaluative information that permit the localisation of sources of methodological and theoretical success and error. When that happens successive improvements converge on a successful mastery of the research domain. The unfolding learning process has synergistically improved both the specific research at hand and the ability to perform effective research generally. Acquaintance with scientific research confirms the general lineaments of this model. In the case of my own research in plasma physics, for instance, the initial experimental investigation of electron cyclotron resonance in plasmas began with uncertainty about how, or even whether, it would work in real locally confined, inhomogeneous plasmas (as opposed to the infinite uniform models of theoretical electromagnetism) and how, or even whether, it was possible, to validly investigate it experimentally with the limited means to hand of external microwave and wire (Langmuir) probes when it plausibly occurs least distorted only in the central region of the plasma. Trials of experimental procedure eventually issued in a sufficiently workable combination of a specially designed plasma vessel (to enhance central uniformity), a combination of wire and microwave probes, a procedure centring on continuous variation of the magnetic field strength (to alter cyclotron frequency around the microwave frequency), and a complicated process for calculating data estimates and error ranges. This method demonstrated for the first time the presence of cyclotron resonance, consistent with electromagnetic theory. Here cycles of trial interaction in which modification was driven by local fail- ure combined with lessons from success elsewhere in plasma experimentation (and physics more widely) eventually led to identification of sources of error (mainly) and, importantly, also on occasion to success and, through both, to the convergence on the successful experimental procedures. The experience motivated formulation of a predecessor convergence model of valid scientific understanding.44 Of equal or more importance to plasma physics than the result were the methodological lessons learned. The thrust of the SDAL model is to capture the way in which the nature of the problems identified as constituting the tasks - the research profile - is itself learned during the process. Like the detective and the crime profile, not only do scientists use the research profile to coordinate and focus their activity, they actively modify and articulate it to improve its ability to generate effective research activity. A more elegant example of SDAL is provided by research on primate language. Early research (e.g. Gardner et al. 1989) inevitably employed poorly defined con- ceptions of the phenomena and suffered from serious methodological flaws 43 For simplicity scientific activities are presented in an abstract manner; in reality the primary locus of these activities can vary from individuals to laboratory teams to large inter-disciplinary and/or international teams, with complex role and motive interrelations between individuals and teams (cf. Hooker 1995, Sect. 2.3.1). 44 For more details of the plasma example and the convergence conception of validity see footnote 37. £} Springer</page><page sequence="28">540 Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 (Wallman 1 992). Severe criticism was raised both within the discipline and from related disciplines. For instance, the psychologist Terrace attacked it on the twin fronts that apparently demonstrated language competency could be explained by behaviourist principles, especially via unintended experimenter cuing, and/or did not meet the requirements to constitute a language (e.g. Terrace et al. 1979). At this point there was a mounting move to abandon the research, but a minority response to the criti- cism was instead to re-think the presuppositions of the approach, especially to refocus the conception of symbolic communication and to restructure the experimental tech- niques (Savage-Rumbaugh 1986). Specifically, the interactive sociality of language was emphasised, its social use to shape (others) actions, as opposed to restricting method to the isolated acquisition of arbitrarily imposed symbol content. This trans- formed the laboratory test preparation situation to focus on ape-ape interaction where the grasping of symbols with reference to within the social setting had essential life roles. Improved linguistic performance followed, as determined by new, more strin- gent standards, thus under-cutting the 'it isn't language' criticisms. Transforming the approach also opened up new test procedures that removed the direct roles for human experimenters that had been necessary to the preceding approach (as teachers of sym- bol content) and thus opened the way to also avoid the methodological criticisms concerned with implicit experimenter cuing and ambiguous task evaluation.45 In the early stages of a research discipline, e.g. in ape language research, the theories, hypotheses and intuitions of the researchers are likely to be poorly formulated and/or vague. Because these are resources that scientists use to guide experimentation, it will be difficult to achieve the coordination of factors required for producing recognisably useful data. One of the first sources of pressure will be on experimental instruments and protocols, because not enough will be known about the process for effective state preparation and instrumental control. However as more experiments are performed the interrelations between theoretical issues, data and experimental design are explored. Information accumulates about what actually happens under various experimental regimes, allowing the localisation of sources of difficulty and the recognition of new factors that must be taken into consideration. A common type of criticism directed against claimed 'results' is that the experiment has failed to control for one or more relevant factors. While the goal of 'effective experimentation' is vaguely specified by 45 In a similar fashion early studies of primate culture, such as the famous Japanese potato-washing obser- vations, which suggested that imitation was a widespread phenomenon, were criticised for not identifying simpler means of information transfer that could plausibly explain the data and that would not, it was pre- sumed, be properly termed cultural (Heyes 1993). The response was again to change experimental methods and to develop a modified conception of primate social interaction that distinguished between a variety of mechanisms of information transmission. Whether or not the phenomena is appropriately termed cultural, recent results (e.g. de Waal 1999) demonstrate a surprising richness to primate social interaction that is cer- tainly interesting, and could not have been discovered were it not for the improved conception of the issues provided by the debate within the research community and related disciplines, and increasing understanding of the context provided by experimental investigation. These episodes in the history of science were first identified as exemplifying SDAL-like features by Christensen as part of our joint research programme. Subsequently his post-doctoral successor, Robert Farrell, and I have prepared a detailed examination of the language episode which fully supports its SDAL character and has revealed a wealth of further insights not originally anticipated - see Farrell and Hooker (2007a,b). We thank Christensen warmly for his initial insight and subsequent feedback. â Springer</page><page sequence="29">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 54 1 the research agenda, and many coordination constraints are required to guide satisfac- tory performance, the recognition of each new factor in the experimental processes provides a coordination constraint that allows the experimenter to better determine what is going on and what should be done in order to achieve a reliable, severe test. If all goes well, enough of the factors involved in the experimental situation will be dis- covered to construct an experimental methodology capable of producing reasonably reliable data. Of course, typically the success of an experimental methodology will also lead to a recognition of its limitations.46 Thus, we can trace a cycle of directive shaping from the research profile to exper- imental design and back to the research profile. This cycle possesses the important characteristics of the SDAL model, since it involves increasingly rich modelling of the circumstances of experimentation which results in: (a) improved recognition of relevant information, e.g. of what counts as significant data rather than a rare but ran- dom fluctuation, (b) more focussed activity, e.g. the selection of a significant problem, or the development of improved experimental protocols, and (c) more precise perfor- mance evaluation, from more precise assessment of instrumental errors to a sharper focus on which system parameters to design experiments to measure, to the decision that the research problem is limited in some way and must be modified or replaced with an improved research profile. As a result, even where large parts of the original research profile are abandoned the effort may not be wasted since the large amount of contextual information that has been generated serves to improve anticipative theory construction and the localisation of success and error within the discipline. Although this brief summary cannot do justice to the power and richness of the SDAL perspective to illuminate the ape language research (footnote 45) it should be apparent how the SDAL cycle is at work. In this case the SDAL synergy between learn- ing improved interaction (experimentation) methods and learning how to learn about investigating intelligent, social animals is particularly powerful because it leads to the transformation of the 'profile' of the nature and role of language in a social commu- nity in a way that opens up a radically new methodological space. This is the essence of SDAL learning. It also focuses attention on methodological change as a, in many cases, the, principal driver of scientific change (as opposed to the primary emphasis As discussed by Bechtel and Richardson (1993), for instance, analytic localisation methods in biology have been highly successful in generating tractable, useful research. One of the most interesting results of such research has been the recognition that simple assumptions about the localisation of function to structure are often wrong. For example, Bechtel and Richardson chart a transition from 'black box' to local linear to non-local cyclic models of sub-cellular respiration as experimentation (and theory) were articulated and refined. So, while localisation techniques have allowed the accumulation of vast amounts of physiological data, they have also facilitated a discovery that some of the most important features of biological systems are complex non-localised process interactions. Thus, taking advantage of the body of results generated by a successful research methodology, some scientists may argue for changes to the research profile on which the research methodology is based. Miklos et al. ( 1 994), for instance, argues that the non-local interactions in developmental genetics are of sufficient complexity that the standard localisation and optimisation approaches to functional anatomy are inadequate for investigating them. He suggests that they should be supplemented with or replaced by much more complex 'model systems' methodologies which model the developmental pathways from genomes to whole organisms - this research field is now known as systems biology or synthetic biology - see footnote 10. â Springer</page><page sequence="30">542 Synthèse (2009) 166:5 1 3-546 on theory change in the standard approach).47 Moreover, SDAL cycles can for this reason operate across so-called revolutionary periods of change as well as across the less transformative 'puzzle-solving' changes (as in the plasma physics example). This demonstrates a deeper SDAL-cycling organisation to science and explains the way in which the learning capacity of science improves over time in tandem with the adequacy of its content. SDAL processes have a number of advantages over uncontrolled VSR learning because the biasing factors on V, S, and R introduce a directedness to the process. While an uncontrolled VSR process merely randomly reshapes a system process, a regulated VSR process reshapes the process in systematic ways. This can be a more power- ful adaptive capacity than an uncontrolled VSR process, because: (i) Self-directed learning produces a cumulative generation of organisation (by retaining successful structure and building on it). A mere sequence of uncontrolled VSR processes retains no extended memory of success or failure, nor does organisation accumulate except accidentally, (ii) This cumulative process is directed in the sense that the high order goal constraints actively maintain the global functional relevance of the acquired reg- ulatory organisation, and self-directed in the sense that acquired organisation further refines the development process. Uncontrolled VSR learning is undirected. For this reason, (iii) self-directed learning is more immediately efficient at reshaping the under- lying processes (though this would be of no help if (ii) did not obtain), (iv) The fact that the process is cumulative and based on goal-constrained interaction allows the open-ended construction of very rich structures which contain high order informa- tion concerning system-environment interaction. Because SDAL uses interaction as a structuring factor it is in effect using the environment as a source of organisation. Uncontrolled VSR processes simply use the environment as a source of selection. There is therefore a deep connection between sophisticated CODE dynamics and cognition, namely that the very organisational capacities which make the former pos- sible are also those which ground cognitive processes. These are those self-directing processes which most powerfully realise endogenous regulation of the basic VSR process. The complex form of CODE promises to provide a rich framework for under- standing the internal processes of science.48 4 Conclusion From unicellular organisms to scientists, from basic autonomy to sophisticated scien- tific knowledge discovery, it has been the organisation and management of interaction process that has been at the focus of analysis. 47 Cf. Rescher (1977) and Hooker (1995, chapter4) on systematically extending Reseller's position. 48 In particular, following the work of my doctoral student Shi (2000), there is a prospect of understanding the cognitive institutional rules and regulation of science as emerging self-organisationally from a multi- plicity of partially locally coordinated interactions among diverse strategic agents, of which the emergence of price in the market is the best known example. This perspective richly integrates with endowing such agents, and suitably organised research groups of them, with SDAL capability to generate an emergent, fluid and highly adaptive, SDAL cycling process organisation to science. This would provide a powerful and dynamically principled embedding of scientific activity within its socio-economic setting. £} Springer</page><page sequence="31">Synthèse (2009) 1 66:5 1 3-546 543 The fundamental criteria for life, autonomy, specifies an organisational constraint on two interaction processes and already delivers a remarkably rounded proto-agency. The shift from unicellular to multicellular organisms and the advancing sophistication of the latter focuses on the power of their interaction management, especially with their environment. And advancing cognitive and correlative intentional capacity feeds off this latter as organisms become more self-directed, delivering an increasingly directed CODE process and culminating in a synergistic organisation of internal with external interaction management that delivers SDAL learning and open problem solving. In many respects it is not an orthodox picture that is generated, since it replaces the familiar and self-contained appeals to logic and language as the central organisational principles of intelligent agency with an embodied, multi-dimensional and integrated, action-centred account that has an equally complex and indirect relationship to both simple trait-selectionist and sociological accounts. But it does deliver us a satisfyingly integrated relationship to the rest of the natural order, a conception of agency that binds together its intelligent and intentional capacities and a fresh understanding of the cognitive organisation of science that is deeper than the revolutionary/normal and epistemological/social divides.
