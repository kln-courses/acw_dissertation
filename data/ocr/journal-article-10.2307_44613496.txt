In these institutions, known as Casas de Misericordia, the relation between the disposition of space and the possibility to control and influence the will of individuals was studied. This new consideration of space had a profound influence on areas as diverse as urban development and penitentiary systems. The myth of surveillance is one of the most representative of contemporary society1 and is one of the few that have crossed the ill-defined frontier between the industrial and the post-industrial eras. The presence of surveillance is felt throughout our cities, in banks, office blocks and elsewhere. Since 11 September 2001 security measures have intensified and levels of surveillance have reached new heights. Precisely because of their pervasiveness in modern society, it is important to reflect on the relation between the disposition of space, surveillance systems and social regulation, and to consider how they emerged and evolved. Jeremy Bentham formulated his idea of the panopticon (Figure 1) at the end of the eighteenth century. The panopticon has been considered the starting point of a school of thought that sees an important link between the organization of space on the one hand and supervision and disciplinary systems on the other. This study focuses on a model that can be considered to be a forerunner of Bentham's panopticon. During the sixteenth century commercial capi- talism began to establish itself in Europe as a new economic and social sys- tem. Its development disrupted the relations between the various sectors of society, and caused widespread problems of order and public health. In response to the urgent need for social intervention, new institutions, 1 R.

As the economic and social system grew, new methods had to be found to manage the labour force. Labour had to be redistributed in new sectors and in new locations. Specifically de- signed institutions were necessary for interning miscreants who survived through begging and petty crime, and who caused problems of hygiene and order. Far-reaching economic and social changes were taking place throughout Europe. The case of Spain presented certain characteristics of its own, though the crisis of the seventeenth century has often tended to over- shadow the transformations of the late 1400s. At the end of the fifteenth century there was already significant banking activity - deposits, credit, transfers of cheques and bills of exchange - and major improvements had been made in the area of accounting. These advances ushered in a new economic mentality. The extent of its influence varied from country to country but, as Heers rightly noted, several Spanish cities were quick to adapt to the new economic climate. The huge advances in trading and economic activity in a city like Seville bear clear witness to this trend.2 2 J.

He says: 'The American adventure - and the use of the term "adventure" does not detract in any way from what we are about to say - should be understood as a result that could only be achieved in a country with an appreciable level of pre-capitalist development and State policy/4 Maravall described the new mentality in the following terms: Pre-capitalist development, booming trade, the start of industrial growth, the discovery of America, hegemony in Europe, the transformation of Spain's domestic political arena and of the conception of its international political role, concern for the well-being of the people, and the efforts to improve their levels of hygiene, education, and professional status were all manifestations of the characteristic modern mentality which was at the very basis of the formation of the State.5 Of course, many traditional economic practices remained in place, and with them the mentality and social interactions that they created. This was also true in many other European countries,6 but as a result of a series of economic and social developments that we cannot discuss here, at the start of the seventeenth century the Spanish productive system was uncompetitive in comparison with those established elsewhere in Europe. Nonetheless, we should not underestimate the dynamism of commercial and manufacturing activity in sixteenth-century Spain. The textile sector provides a good illustration. In Segovia, around 16,200 pieces were produced per year between 1579 and 1584 which represented two-thirds of the production of Venice and slightly more than half that of Florence.7 Cordova, Toledo, Cuenca (which produced around 4,000 rolls per year), Avila (6,000) and Palencia were also important textile centres, albeit on a smaller scale. And Spain was the second largest silk producer in Europe, surpassed only by Italy: Toledo had 6,000 looms, Granada 4,000 and Cordova 2,000.8 Mention should also be made of the ironmaking industry. Though lacking the force of the textile sector and made up by small, relatively weak firms, in the middle of the century it was producing between 11,000 and 13,000 tonnes per year, which represented around 25 per cent of the total production in Europe (though from this point onwards it fell into decline).9 Naval shipbuilding also flourished until 1575.10 3 P. et H.

Trans- Atlantic trade was also extremely important. For reasons of space we are unable to assess its repercussions for the Spanish economy here, but there is no doubt that it expanded rapidly until at least the middle of the sixteenth century. A city that owed its emergence as a powerful commercial centre to Spain's trans-Atlantic interests was Seville, of which Domínguez Ortiz said: 'Before the rise of Amsterdam in no other city did mercantile capitalism have a clearer, more modern profile.'12 Furthermore, during the sixteenth century the urban population in Spain was increasing rapidly, and indeed by the following century the proportion of city dwellers was above the European average.13 This appraisal of sixteenth-century Spain presents a rather different pic- ture from the one often described that sees the country as a predominantly feudal society. This traditional view bases itself on the undeniable weakness of the bourgeoisie, the decline of this class at the end of the century, the resistance of the more conservative sectors and the con- siderable territorial differences in the impact of changes; but, according to Maravall,14 none of this prevented the emergence at an early stage of a new mentality, the one we described above: a credo that differed from the traditional one in contemplating the possibility of transforming the world, no longer seeing it as immutable. As Bennassar15 says, drawing to an extent on Ruth Pike's classic study of Seville16 it is wrong to suggest that the backwardness of Spain was the fault of the bourgeois and the traders, who in fact proved themselves to be more than capable when economic circumstances permitted. Naturally enough, this new attitude clashed with the more conservative position. We will find evidence of this conflict when we assess sixteenth- century attitudes to poverty, and indeed it is also palpable in other areas, such as the question of productive work, fiercely debated by authors such as Luis Ortiz, Juan de Robles and Pedro de Valencia, among others.17 So it is against the background of an innovative mentality and the advocacy of a new idea of the state - fiercely challenged by its numerous detractors - that we should see the project for welfare reform and the architectural model proposed by a clergyman, Miguel Giginta, and a physician, Cristobal Pérez de Herrera, at the end of the sixteenth century, 11 Bennassar, La España , 190. 12 A.

Though the organization of space was by no means the central feature of their programme, their treatment of it is a watershed in the history of the relationship between space and surveillance. It is not certain that Bentham was aware of the existence of his predecessors,18 but the link between space, discipline and vigilance that Giginta's work establishes re-emerges in a new form in the Englishman's thought. The article will also test two other hypotheses. The first is to do with the time spans in which social thought is constructed. We suggest that it is social and economic development that creates solutions for the dysfunctions that it generates, and that the solutions it finds, either regulations or institutions, are modified over time. So, we suggest, there is a continuous link between some of the institutions of the sixteenth century and those of the twentieth. The second hypothesis could be formulated as follows: much of the progress in science and in knowledge in general is the result of a reappraisal of things that are already known.19 Giginta's innovative vision of institutions for the poor radically changed their spatial organization, and created a new paradigm in the relation between the disposition of space and control. As is often the case, the clergyman's proposals were not widely accepted by his contemporaries; innovative ideas may require a long process of social and scientific maturation in order to become established.20 Like the example of the miller studied by Carlo Ginzburg,21 Giginta's work was to an extent an amalgam; his conception of space, internment, vigilance and discipline brought together knowledge from many different places which until that time had been disparate and unconnected22 and which he was able to crystallize in a building, a surveillance system, or a set of regulations. The world of poverty Many sixteenth-century authors would have agreed that 'the poor will always be with us'. The situation of the poor was becoming particularly serious at this time. On the one hand, their numbers were increasing; on 18 On the possible connection of the models of Giginta and Bentham, see F. Santaolaria, 'Estudio introductorio', in M. Giginta, Tractado del remedio de pobres (1579) (Barcelona, 2000), 41-6. 19 See J.D. Watson, The Double Helix (London, 1968). 20 Feyerabend used the example of Pitágoras to illustrate the point. P.

He suggests, for example, that monastic dormitories, Turkish surveillance systems and Byzantine architectural traditions all influenced Giginta's organization of space.</page><page sequence="6">312 Urban History the other, poverty was becoming an urban phenomenon and at the same time creating problems of sanitation and law and order. It was a matter of growing concern, and the poor themselves were becoming the objects of study and reflection. It is difficult to make quantitative estimates for a phenomenon in an era which has left few statistical records, and of course the concept of poverty is particularly hard to define, but specialists have established figures23 that appear to be fairly consistent across Europe and relatively stable until the beginning of the eighteenth century. Scholars have often used the expressive image of a series of concentric circles, with relatively permeable frontiers; families could enter and leave the world of poverty on more than one occasion during their lifetimes. Wolf describes this process as follows: Bearing in mind these reservations, some attempt at quantification, however approximate, remains necessary. The conceptual distinctions introduced by Gutton and Pulían for urban poverty offer a useful approach, and case studies of early modern cities in England, France and Spain provide figures with similar orders of magnitude. The 'structural' poor, incapable of earning a living for reasons of age, illness or physical handicap and hence wholly dependent on assistance or begging, amounted to between 4 and 8 per cent of the populations of Salisbury, Norwich, Odense, Lyons, Toledo, Venice, Florence, Rome and many other cities of north and central Italy from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries. The urban 'conjunctural' or 'crisis' poor, usually dependent on low wages or casual employment and hence immediately affected by fluctuations in bread prices, amounted to about 20 per cent. A third concentric circle (to use Pullan's metaphor) of artisans, small retailers and petty officials, who can be identified with the householders assessed at minimum tax rates, could fall easily and repeatedly beneath the level of subsistence, for personal family reasons or as a result of trade stoppages, so swelling the proportion of the urban poor, at crisis moments, to include as many as 50 to 70 per cent of all households.24 Other estimates present very similar data. Redondo25 reports that 25 per cent of the population of Toledo in the mid-sixteenth century was composed of this jumble of paupers and vagrants. Official records such as the 1561 census gave an estimate of 10 per cent in Valladolid,26 which included only the pobres sedentarios , the 'officially poor'. In the same era, 23 An idea of the various conceptions can be found in J.P. Gutton, La société et les pauvres en Europe, XVI et XVII siècles (Paris, 1974); B.S.

Significantly, it was urban in nature; indeed Gascon called the city the factory and the asylum of the poor.29 Another point to consider is how the poor were regarded by the rest of society. At the risk of generalization, it could be said that some paupers were accepted by their community. They were those who were obviously unable to fend for themselves - old people, widows - and who did not try to conceal their situation. Another sector was formed by the pobres vergonzantes , people who had enjoyed a certain social status at some stage in their lives, but who had fallen on hard times. They were unable to work or to acknowledge their situation because it would have been humiliating to do so, and so they could only be helped in secret. Then there were beggars and vagrants, who were unknown to the city's inhabitants and constantly on the move. Although they often had sores or malformations, it was always suspected that they were in fact able to work but preferred to live off the charity of others. This rise in poverty was the result of the profound transformations taking place in Europe in general and in Spain in particular in the sixteenth century.30 An analysis of the phenomenon is beyond the scope of this article, but it is clear that the rise in poverty was strongly influenced by economic aspects that caused social polarization, and by demographic aspects as well. If in addition we bear in mind the taxes imposed on those who worked the land31 it is easy to see why many left for the cities, where living off charity became a way of life. The pre-capitalism of the sixteenth century and urban growth32 were two sides of the same coin. In this new situation the expansion of the economy increased the numbers of the poor in the cities, who were the cause of major social problems. So the development of internment centres was closely linked to the model of growth that was beginning to function at that time.33 Giginta's and Pérez de Herrera's proposals for welfare 27 Maza, Pobreza, 42.

The debate on poverty This new kind of poverty required immediate action. The response took two forms: on the one hand, municipal regulations in certain cities,34 and, on the other, intense debate on the correct approach to the problem and on the creation of welfare institutions. Significantly, the backdrop to this debate was the confrontation between Catholicism and Protestantism. The debate on welfare reform revolved fundamentally around two points. The first was a discussion of whether shelter should actually be provided for the poor; those that were in favour advocated what today would be called means testing, an examination to determine who was truly unable to fend for themselves. The second point was the discussion of the internal functioning of the institutions. In Spain the debate was particularly acrimonious, because many of the more innovative proposals, or simply the ones that did not accept the traditional Catholic idea of the absolute freedom of the poor, were fiercely criticized because of their Lutheran overtones in a country that considered itself the champion of the Counter-Reformation. The first link in the chain was Luis Vives' De Subventione pauperum, which appeared in Bruges in 1526 and which set out the Erasmist position on the question of the poor. For Vives, the cause of poverty was social; it was therefore a political problem, and welfare should be supplied by the public authorities, not necessarily the Church. He proposed that paupers should first be examined in order to identify those who could provide for themselves. Those who were considered able-bodied were to be put to work immediately and those who were not were to be interned in special institutions. Vives devised a disciplinary strategy for these establishments, proposing that vagrants should not be given what they asked for - that is, food, rest or peace and quiet - but what they needed, that is discipline, good working habits and pastoral care. The pillar of his system was work, the universal medicine of which no one was to be deprived. Working, he said, makes one industrious, and fatigue combats lascivious and rebellious thought. The system was based on discipline, order and work. Naturally, his proposals were not without their detractors. Among other writings on these themes in sixteenth-century Spain was Gabriel de Toro's Thesoro de misericordia divina y humana , which appeared in 1536. The work was highly successful and was reprinted no fewer than five times - each time, in fact, that an economic recession increased the 34 The regulations of Nuremberg (1522), Strasbourg (1523) and Ypres (1525) are well known.</page><page sequence="9">The Casas de Misericordia in sixteenth-century Spain 315 numbers of the poor and the reformist proposals seemed to be gaining popularity. The Thesoro could be described as 'critical orthodoxy', because it is a solid defence of the most conservative positions, but also presents a perceptive economic and sociological analysis of the origins of poverty35 and a fierce criticism of the selfishness of the rich and the extravagance of the Catholic Church. At almost the same time Charles V passed the Edict of Ghent, which aimed to control and restrict begging in the provinces of the north. Soon afterwards, the Edict of 1540 proposed the same objectives for Spain. It stated that the poor should be interned in special institutions in their places of origin, and also that hospitals be concentrated in order to make the best use of the resources available. These proposals were influenced by the reforms being implemented at local level throughout mid-sixteenth- century Europe. But these reformist measures were never likely to take root in a country intent on becoming the standard-bearer of the Counter-Reformation. The proposals challenged strict orthodoxy and were rapidly branded as Protestant heresy. The dispute between a Dominican, Fray Domingo de Soto, and a Benedictine, Fray Juan de Robles (or de Medina), bears witness to the atmosphere of the times. Fray Juan, an enthusiastic reformist, had introduced several innovations in Zamora and their influence had been felt in Salamanca and Valladolid. Both priests published books in Salamanca in 1545, which neatly summarized the two positions. Fray Domingo,36 a leading member of the School of Salamanca,37 de- fended the most conservative positions, finding fault with the proposed examination and praising the spectacle of poverty, saying that beggars should be able to roam the cities with total freedom, exposing their misery to onlookers so as to arouse the compassion and charity of the rich. Medina's38 argument, on the other hand, recalled many of Vives' proposals published a few years earlier. Medina also held that welfare should be provided by secular institutions, and proposed a fairer distribution of resources in place of the idea of charity.39 The 1560s brought some new developments in the debate on the regulation of begging. In 1557, as is well known, the English had begun to 35 The 1536 edition is extremely rare. We use the following one: G.

The experiment was then implemented throughout the country. Elsewhere in Europe various institutions were set up, best described as 'work houses', though they received different names in different countries. The political importance of the problem of poverty and vagrancy was becoming increasingly clear, as was the need for measures that could be applied throughout the society, not merely at local level.40 It was obvious that the problem of welfare was a political one and was therefore the responsibility of the state. In Spain, works such as Villavicencio's De oeconomia sacra 41 defended the strictest orthodoxy. But there were also pamphlets and manuscripts that proposed guidelines for a modern welfare reform. A good example is an anonymous text dated 1560 and entitled Que los Hospitales generales es un buen medio para el remedio de pobres ... 42 which advanced the ideas on welfare circulating in other areas of Europe at that time. The manuscript proposed that the poor be gathered together in institutions known as hospitales generales, and that the state should take responsibility for this task and also provide the funding. The aim was to create a state network in which a general, standardized intervention could be undertaken. This secularizing trend was visible at the end of the century in the plans put forward by Miguel Giginta and Cristobal Pérez de Herrera.43 Giginta designed the main guidelines for the reform, and Pérez de Herrera, a more practical man with an eye for detail, was in charge of putting the plans into practice. The reformist proposals of Giginta and Pérez de Herrera. The city and the building The debate on poverty and charity pervaded the whole of the society, and the values and criteria that it generated reached all corners of everyday life. That is to say, the systems of organization or functioning that emerged from it moulded people's conceptions of work and idleness, their ideas of how they should use their time, their moral attitudes and even their perceptions of the city. From this perspective it is interesting to explore the 40 R. Matthews, Pagando tiempo. Una introducción a la sociología del encarcelamiento (Barcelona, 2003), 27. 41 L.

Leonardo Benevolo44 has explained that at the end of the sixteenth century and the early years of the seventeenth there were two basic conceptions of the city. The first corresponds to the political model of the great monarchies, which found its architectural expression in bold, clear perspectives and imposing buildings to lift the spirits. The examples that Benevolo mentions are the royal squares of Henri IV in Paris (1604-06), the Plaza Mayor in Madrid (1617) or the first expansion of the city of Turin (1620). The planning of Dutch cities such as Amsterdam presents a highly different picture. There, 'the territory itself is a product of human interventions, which intensified in the second half of the sixteenth century . . . The development of the cities is based on the sanitation of the surrounding areas, and proceeds in accordance with joint plans promoted by local institutions/45 So we have two conceptions: one that we could call Baroque, with its focus on the grand scale and its desire to impress its observers; and other based on an organic, functionalist vision of the city. Both approaches are discernible in the writings of our reformers. Everyday life in sixteenth-century Spain was characterized by a certain theatricality, a taste for the grand gesture and flamboyance. In 1547, Pedro Mexia stated that in Seville more balconies had been built in the last ten years than in the preceding thirty.46 The figure may be exaggerated, but is indicative of the enthusiasm for theatrical display among the city's residents. Giginta subscribed wholeheartedly to this conception of the city. He wanted to convert it into a stage for a play that he had written and directed. Let us look at some of the integral parts of his plan. Given that poverty was a political problem, it had to be addressed at the level of the state. To ensure that no pauper should escape internment, the process should commence on the same day and at the same time throughout the country. At this moment the poor would have two options: they could either enter a special institution, known as Casa de Misericordia (Almshouse) or they would be obliged to work. Individual begging would be a thing of the past; there would be a new social consensus that alms would only be given to beggars who were identified as internees of the Casa de Misericordia. These 'official' beggars would be collecting for the institution, and the charity they received was to be placed in a closed, sealed box.47 44 Benevolo, La ciudad, 137-8. 4S Ibid., 138. 46 F. Marías, El larvo siglo XVI (Madrid, 1989), 52. 47 Giginta 's project reveals a certain desire to use poverty to educate the whole of society. We will come across this argument later on, when, in the interests of hygiene, the Ciencia de Policía tried to improve some of habits of the urban population. P. Fraile, La otra ciudad del rey. Ciencia de Policía y organización urbana en España (Madrid, 1997); P. Fraile, Tutting order into the cities: the evolution of " policy science" in eighteenth-century Spain', Urban History, 25, 1 (1998).</page><page sequence="12">318 Urban History Since the aim of the project was not to eliminate poverty but to control begging, Giginta proposed a detailed plan for placing the Casa' s beggars at strategic points throughout the city. The blind were to beg in the busiest streets; they were to be taken there by the beggars without hands or arms; since the latter were the ones who aroused the most pity, they were to beg in the church. They also provided transport, pushing the beggars who could not walk in carts. At noon, the beggars who aroused the least repugnance were to call at houses in carefully selected streets. At the time of the great church celebrations - Easter, for example - the beggars that incited the most compassion and made the public reflect on the ephemeral nature of life and earthly goods were placed at the door of the church.48 Giginta's aim was to organize this spectacle in order to make it more effective. He studied times, places, different types of beggars - almost even the clothes that they wore - to heighten the effect that they created. So the inmates of the Casa de Misericordia mixed with the citizenry, taking up positions at its doors, its churches, its markets - at all the busiest places in the city - at carefully chosen moments, and with their lines well learnt. Giginta saw the whole city as a stage on which a drama unfolds, and the aim of the production was to educate by acting on the emotions. For it to work, the spectacle had to be omnipresent: no honest member of society going about their daily business could be allowed to avoid the studied, measured representation of poverty.49 The vision of the physician Cristobal Pérez de Herrera was more rationalist. Pérez de Herrera wrote several discursos to the Crown on a variety of subjects, among which those relating to poverty and charity were compiled in a volume entitled Discurso del amparo de los legítimos pobres,50 but he also sent two other letters, one to Philip II and the other to Philip III, on questions relating to the organization and control of the population of Madrid. His entire work is impregnated with an Aristotelian, organicist conception of political organization and the disposition of the city. This anthropomorphic view51 led him to see the city as a complex entity that performed a variety of tasks, for which a series of specific institutions needed to be created in particular areas, each with its own function. He proposed the establishment of a welfare area in Madrid, on the road to Atocha. The site was to house the Seminario de niños y niñas de Santa Isabel la Real (which took in orphans and abandoned children), the Casa del amparo de la Milicia and the Albergue de pobres (which had other functions such as the reclusión of vagrants and ex-prostitutes), the Hospital General and the Casa de Convalecencia. In addition, nearby there was to be a cloth factory 48 This approach is repeated in many of his works, for example in M. Giginta, Tractado del remedio de pobres (Coimbra, 1579), 15-15(b). 49 M.

The point of reference in this area was to be a large building which would house the paupers, the ex-prostitutes, the Hospital General and the Casa de Convalecencia. The establishment was an experimental model, in which aspects of construction, organization and disciplinary methods would be tested; once perfected they would be applied to the whole of the network that was to be built at state level. Pérez de Herrera was among the first proponents of procedures of this kind, which in fact became commonplace in the prison network some 200 years later. To summarize, we can say that the city played a major role in the creation of this new method of imposing discipline. This role was conceived in two different ways. Giginta's vision, closer to the Baroque conception of society, stressed the theatrical aspect of the city. The other approach was underpinned by an organicist attitude, proposing a territorial differentiation based on the separation of functions, in which there would be a special welfare institution able to exploit the economies of scale generated by the concentration of large numbers of inmates. The other important aspect of these proposals, from the point of view of the disposition of space, was the design and the layout of the building, which was the key element of the reform. In this regard it was Giginta who was the great innovator. His plan was simple and uncompromising. The series of Casas de Misericordia that he envisaged would, as far as possible, follow the same pattern. They were all to be built in the shape of a Greek cross, in the centre of which - where the four wings meet - would be the chapel and the surveillance point. Let us look at the plan in more detail. The altar was to be in the centre, so that all the internees could see it and hear mass from every corner of the building. Here, as well, dramatic and communicative elements were foremost in Giginta's mind: he suggested decorating the walls with paintings of the Last Judgement and the story of poor Lazarus,53 and allegories of the importance of charity and the punishment that no man escapes. But the truly original feature was the idea of a central surveillance point, and its power to discipline the inmates and to act on their will. This is how Giginta conceived it: And the guard's house will have a room above the chapel in the transept, with small windows for each section, and Venetian blinds in each, through which all that occurs in all the sections may be seen: and thus no one may even lift his foot, nor play, nor eat sweetmeats, nor argue, nor misbehave, without that he be seen. 52 M. Cavillac, 'L'enfermement des pauvres, en Espagne, à la fin du XVIème siècle', in Picaresque européenne. Études sociocritiques (19 75), 56. w See for example Giginta, Exhortación , 42(b); Giginta, Atalaya , 7(b).</page><page sequence="14">320 Urban History They will believe that they are being observed from behind these blinds; and, given that there is so much light, and that they are all visible to each other, as confidants and spies of the guard they will all behave with docility, though it is their fear of the blinds that controls their acts.54 So surveillance became generalized and impersonal: invisible but omnipresent. More than once Giginta likened this surveillance to that which God exerts over men. It was an effect that he set out to achieve with his organization of space. This unremitting presence, together with the implementation of a specific daily routine, acted on the will of the inmates, broke down resistance and made it possible to influence their behaviour. It was a new disciplinary strategy, based on an organization of space able to create the sensation of permanent, relentless surveillance. Another interesting feature of this disposition of space is the fact that the surveillance and the chapel were united at the same point. The inmates looked towards the altar, and from the altar came the gaze that watched them every moment of their lives. In the presence of this trinity of power, surveillance and religion, there was no alternative but submission. The model was not put into practice immediately, but its repercussions were enormous; it was the basis for many attempts to control the population and to impose order where before there was none.55 Cristóbal Pérez de Herrera seconded the clergyman's proposals, though his attitude was more pragmatic. He saw the hospice merely as a place of lodging for the paupers, not where they should perform most of their activities. His main contribution is his eye for detail, and his proposals for the dimensions of the institution and for classification systems. His plans for the Atocha hospice give an extremely thorough description of how the institution should work. His model (shown below in Figure 2) is a square with sides some four hundred feet long.56 The building itself has rectangular halls in the form of a Greek cross, 158 feet by 84, producing a central square where the chapel and the surveillance point were located. Each wing was divided into three rows which were isolated dormitories, except in the front part which was to be the entrance. So Pérez de Herrera had a total of eleven areas in which to establish his classification system. For economic reasons, he thought that the work on the hospice should begin with the first two yards (on the right and left of the entrance). When they were complete the hospice could be opened and could begin to function; the rear would be concluded at a later date. The right front yard would have three or four dormitories, for the male paupers. On the left, there were to be two or three rooms for women with children up to the age of seven; after this age they would have to be placed elsewhere. 54 Gieinta, Tractado, 39(b). 55 'Policy science' was a set of theoretical proposals for the organization and administration of the citv in which these principles were reflected.

The same yard was to house the Casa de Trabajo y Labor for vagrant women or prostitutes. The front of the hospice was thus complete and the radial system of central surveillance was already in place. Later, when the rear part with the three new rows was completed, two were divided, and so there were four wards (of varying degrees of isolation) where the hospital was to be. The fifth dormitory, which would open on to the rear left yard, was to be the Casa de Convalecencia. The yards, where the inmates spent much of their time, were to have a chimney to provide warmth and porticos where they could shelter in bad weather.</page><page sequence="16">322 Urban History Figure 3: Filarete's Ospedale Maggiore in Milan: floor plan and cross-section by Toilet Source : Leistikow, Edificios hospitalarios , 69. Pérez de Herrera explains his central surveillance system in remarkable detail. His main contribution was his classification system, which he also goes to great lengths to describe. The smooth functioning of these poorhouses required strict internal regulations, and the proposals of both Giginta and Pérez de Herrera covered every eventuality. The shape of the cross: the floor plan of the hospitales We should end this study by asking whether Giginta's idea for the disposition of space - the Greek cross with the central surveillance point - was indeed original, or whether it was merely an imitation of earlier models. In the Middle Ages, hospital architecture57 had followed precise, stan- dard patterns, but for present purposes the starting point will be the Renaissance. Indeed, for Leistikow, the hospitals of the beginnings of the 'Modern Age' were substantially different from those of medieval times. The prototype was the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan (Figure 3), 57 D. Leistikow, Edificios hospitalarios en Europa durante diez siglos (Ingelheim am Rhein, 1967); D. Setter, 'Hospitäler mit kreuzförmigem Grundriss', in Atti del primo Congresso europeo di Storia ospitaliera (Reggio Emilia, 1962); A.

This institution was founded by Francesco Sforza and his wife, but its dimensions suggest that it was intended to be a state hospital rather than a private one. The building work seems to have been started in 1456; Filarete's contract terminated in 1465, by which time only a cloister had been completed. In fact the work continued intermittently until the middle of the nineteenth century. The figure shows the two crosses in the floor plan and the four yards that each cross created. In fact Filarete's model housed two separate institutions: one for men, on the north side, and the other for women on the south. At the intersection of the cross is the chapel, which was to be visible to the inmates from all possible angles. In spite of the originality of the construction, the basic idea differed little from the late medieval conception of the hospital which had already given rise to the basilican model, in which the altar was the focal point of the lives of the inmates, and the fundamental objective was moral reform and consolation through religion. The Filarete's model spread through Europe from the second half of the fifteenth century onwards. Naturally, it also reached Spain, though there is much debate among specialists on the route that it took. Its main propagators were two architects from Toledo: the Egas brothers,58 Enrique and Antón.59 Enrique introduced the model in the three great Hospitales Reales built during the reign of the Catholic monarchs: Santiago de Compostela (1499), Santa Cruz de Toledo (1504) and Granada (1511). The main significance of these hospitales lies in the fact that they are part of a broader project. The Crown was involved, to some extent, in the building of all three; they were constructed shortly after the conquest of Granada, during a period marked by the drive towards the establishment of a modern state. As Fêlez said: 'first due to its function as an agent of social cleanliness; and second as the concentration of the bureaucracy, the hospital was a fundamental part of the new ideology of the modern state'.60 Maravall61 has also described how the state, during its process of construction, takes on responsibility for new functions and progressively centralizes them. The provision of welfare (exemplified in the three hospitales described here) begins to be a key feature of the development of the modern state. So the institution of the Hospital Real in Spain was 58 It seems unlikely that the Egas brothers would have been directly influenced by Filarete's Tratado de Arquitectura; perhaps they drew their inspiration from other buildings such as the Hospital dels Foils in Valencia or Todos-os-Santos in Lisbon. See Marias, El largo siglo, 133. 59 On the work of the two brothers, see E. Llaguno and J.A. Cean-Bermúdez, Noticias de los arquitectos y arquitectura de España desde su restauración (Madrid, 1829). 60 C. Félez Lubelza, El Hospital de Granada.

See the text from n. 5.</page><page sequence="18">324 Urban History indissolubly linked to the construction of the centralized state which began with the Catholic monarchs. Therein lies its importance.62 In Santiago, the building of the Hospital enabled the central power to consolidate its recent victories over local oligarchies and indeed to impose its will on the sectors of the Galician aristocracy that were most opposed to change. It also had a deep-seated effect on the structure of the city, creating a neighbourhood that became a symbol of royal authority. The case of Granada is the clearest of all. The Catholic monarchs were determined that the city, recently recovered from the Nazari dynasty, should personify the power of the Crown of Castile. They achieved this by erecting buildings such as the Monastery of Santa Isabel, the Convents of San Francisco and Santa Cruz la Real and, most importantly, the Royal Chapel. So the Hospital Real was one in a succession of buildings constructed to create a new religious and administrative centre and to symbolize a break with the city's Muslim past. The hospital played a vital role in this process. In Toledo the repercussions of the Hospital Real were not so deeply felt. Originally it was to be a different kind of institution, since the Cardinal Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza intended to build a home for foundlings to which he would leave a part of his inheritance on his death. The queen, as executor of his will, was able to change these plans and the institution became a paupers' hospice. The design of these institutions will not be explained in detail here, though it should be pointed out that all cases had the cross layout and the yards formed by the wings (Figures 4 and 5). The altar was in the centre, and it was the focal point for the inmates, but none of these institutions had a specific surveillance point. So these institutions operated with the same criteria as in the late Middle Ages: religion and solace were the basis of the care provided to the inmates, and their moral recovery was of greater concern than their physical condition or their capacity to work. It was probably in Santiago de Compostela that this design attained its fullest expression. The building had two floors, and in the centre there was a double altar (Figure 6). The lower one was the altar of the chapel, and the upper one, supported by four columns, was visible from the inmates' quarters. So it appeared to be suspended in the air; it must have been an awe-inspiring sight. The centripetal conception had not changed, and indeed it was reinforced by the vision of the altar in limbo between the ceiling and the floor. Conclusion: the reinterpretation of the organization of space As this architectural model spread during the sixteenth century, the development of commercial capitalism generated problems and called 62 See, however, A. Rosende Valdês, El Grande y Real Hospital de Santiago de Compostela (Madrid, 1999), 11, who gives a rather different view of the question.</page><page sequence="19">The Casas de Misericordia in sixteenth-century Spain 325 Figure 4: Hospital Real , Santiago de Compostela (ground and first floor) Source : Rosende Valdês, El grande, 18. for solutions. At the time that the Greek cross floor plan was gaining popularity, Vives, Soto and Medina were publishing their writings and the idea of the moral and religious recovery of the inmate endured. Some writers, such as Vives, were beginning to suggest the need for disciplinary intervention, insisting that the institution should inculcate in the inmates what they needed - training, a positive work ethic, discipline - rather than provide them with what they wanted. So the development of two interrelated ideas can be seen. The basic aim of late medieval welfare was moral recuperation, and in this task religion played a key role. The design of the hospitales - the basilican model in which the altar was the focal point for the inmates - sets out to achieve this objective. The hospital in the shape of the cross of the Renaissance period introduced many changes, but it retained the altar as the focal point. But with the profound changes in mentality in the sixteenth century (which reached Spain as well as the rest of Europe) attention now turned towards re-education and discipline. This new focus required new architectural designs. Giginta's new approach was based on an already existing structure but profoundly modified the organization of space, because the entire dynamic of the construction changed from centripetal to centrifugal: the centre no longer attracted but irradiated. This new organization of space was in</page><page sequence="20">326 Urban History Figure 5: Hospital Real , Granada (ground and first floor) Source : Fêlez, El Hospital Real , 234-5.</page><page sequence="21">The Casas de Misericordia in sixteenth-century Spain 327 Figure 6: Double central altar, Hospital de Santiago Source : Rosende Valdês, El grande, 46.</page><page sequence="22">328 Urban History turn closely linked to a disciplinary strategy based on central, omnipresent, impersonal surveillance, a political anatomy of detail63 and on a moderate but progressive system of punishment which, with time, would break down resistance and made it possible to act on the will of the inmates. The system revolved around a particular way of organizing space. When Egas began to design the hospital in Santiago, for example, his plan included the provision of beds for inmates who were sick and unable to fend for themselves, and incapable of anything more than arousing pity in the wealthy. In contrast, Giginta, slightly more than a century later, envisaged a population that included not only the weak and the poor, but petty thieves and individuals with infectious diseases. Not only did Giginta mean to impose order in a potentially explosive situation, but he set out to exploit the productive capacity of the inmates. In addition, for a long time it was believed that if they were put to work then wages would fall; this required a new model based not on passive correction and solace, but on activity and discipline. To conclude we should return to the two other hypotheses proposed at the beginning of the study. The first is that new ideas frequently arise when already existing structures are looked at from a new perspective. Second, we suggested that certain institutions sometimes emerge as the result of a complex process of trial and error. We have seen how a new spatial dynamic provides solutions which traditional positions have been unable to offer. The case of Giginta's proposals presents us with another example of what Maravall termed the 'modern mentality', characterized by a new conception of work, discipline and the functions of the state.64 The long path that unites Giginta's Casa de Misericordia with Bentham's panopticon and later institutions shows us how spatial formulations and ideas are the result of the circumstances of a particular moment, though not all the elements required for their establishment are necessarily present. Formulas may need time and may need specific social conditions to mature before they eventually re-emerge in new contexts. They may lie unnoticed for long periods of time, and then suddenly reappear in new guises. 63 The phrase 'a political anatomy of detail' is used in the same sense as Foucault used it in his writings. 54 Maravall, Estado , vol. II, 292.</page></plain_text>
