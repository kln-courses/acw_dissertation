The scho- lar's relationship to German philosophy and Biblical scholarship is outlined, along with his relationship to Soviet scholarship of the 1920s and 1930s. The development of the scholar's work is related to his encounter with N. Ja. Marr in the early 1920s, and the way in which Marr' s doctrine underwent considerable revisions when subjected to German philosophy and applied to narrative material is detailed. Finally the way in which attention increasingly turned to the genesis of literary plots and poetic metaphor is discussed, along with both the influence such work exerted and the enduring value of such work today. Keywords Frank-Kamenetskij • Marrism • Semantic palaeontology • Myth • Religion • Narrative Until very recently it seemed the work of Izrail' Grigor'evic Frank-Kamenetskij (1880-1937) had sunk almost without trace, along with most other thinkers closely associated with the controversial Georgian philologist and archaeologist Nikolaj Marr (1864-1934). Following Stalin's denunciation of Marr in 1950, Marrism became synonymous with the collapse of science into ideology, a kind of philological counterpart to Lysenko's genetics. Marr's notoriously extravagant ideas such as the supposed derivation of all languages from the four primordial phonemes C.

Brandist sal, ber, jon and ros, and his blunt denial of the existence of families of languages find very few adherents today, and their sheer extremity seems to confirm the overall impression of quackery. However, we are now at the dawn of a recognition that a rather significant baby was thrown out with the bathwater of charlatanism in the 1950s, and that Marr' s own work contains the germs of such now widespread critical categories as linguistic ideology and orientalism (in the sense propagated by Edward Said).1 At the same time the significant achievements of scholars associated with Marr have begun to be recognized: Ol'ga Freidenberg's (1890-1955) work is now recognized as a classic of Soviet philology, while the work of Konstantin Romanovic Megrelidze (1900-1943) is now being recognized as an important contribution to the sociology of knowledge (see especially Megrelidze 2007 [1938]). Recognition of the influence of Marrist scholars on figures such as Lev Vygotskij (1896-1934) and Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975) has also begun to demand a reappraisal of Marrism as an intellectual movement that extends well beyond the bounds of linguistics narrowly conceived. At the centre of this process of extension stands Frank-Kamenetskij, an enormously erudite and sophisticated figure who came to Marrism as an established intellectual and sought to develop its potential for the study of myth, religion and literature. The result was an extraordinarily rich body of work that anticipated some of the more constructive aspects of both structuralism, poststructuralism, and post- colonial theory, but did so within a conceptual framework that is quite alien to those familiar with more recent paradigms. It was only in the late 1990s that a serious attempt to consider the legacy of Frank-Kamenetskij was published (Barst 1997) following the publication of Frank-Kamenetskij' s work on the genesis of the legend of Romeo and Juliet (Frank-Kamenetskij 1994-1996 [1937]) in the preceding years. This work was largely limited to one aspect of Frank-Kamenetskij' s work, on the genesis of literary plots, though a more general, but brief, consideration of Frank- Kamenetskij' s ideas appeared in 2002 (Debaker and Silkov 2002). While each of these works has considerable strengths, neither sought to set Frank-Kamenetskij' s work firmly within the intellectual traditions he belonged to, and neither drew on archival materials to advance our knowledge of the context within which the works appeared. The articles had limited impact partly because Frank-Kamenetskij 's works remained scattered throughout a large number of disparate and difficult to obtain publications. An attempt to publish a fully annotated collection of his work to be entitled Biblical Mythology was made in 1946. Unfortunately this was never completed and the preparatory materials, which amount to some 1,000 pages, still languish in the archive of the Museum of the History of Religion in St. Petersburg (GMIR 1/1/413, 414, 415, 416, 416a). A smaller collection (Frank-Kamenetskij 2004) did finally appear in 2004 making some of his most important texts available to a contemporary readership, but the edition was devoid of any introduction to his life and work, had none of the critical apparatus necessary to make the work accessible to a contemporary readership, and even failed to provide a complete 1 See, for instance, Cherchi and Manning (2002).

Early life A Jew born in Vilnius in 1880, Frank-Kamenetskij was not allowed to reside in the Russian capital and enrolled in the Agricultural department of Kiev Politekhnikum in 1898. The following April he was arrested for organising a student strike and spent 3 months in prison, among the effects of which was to make it impossible for him to pursue higher education in Russia (SPF ARAN 77/1 (1937)/22/5). He then joined the generation of Jews from the Russian Empire who studied in Germany. In 1902 he went to Leipzig and then Berlin Universities where, for seven semesters (1902-1906), he studied philosophy, political economy and ancient history with, inter alia , Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), Georg Simmel (1858-1918), Karl Bücher (1847-1930) and Eduard Meyer (1855-1930).4 This furnished Frank-Kamenetskij with a detailed knowledge of some of the main philosophical trends that underlay the comparative-historical work of the founder of Russian comparative literature Aleksandr Veselovskij (1838-1906) and his followers before he systematically engaged with Marr's ideas.5 The young scholar found himself in the midst of intense intellectual and political excitement that swept German universities in the wake of the first defeat of a major European imperial power by an Asian state in Russo-Japanese War. This challenged received ideas about the orient at the very time when a flood of new textual materials became available to Europeans for the first time, and led Frank- Kamenetskij to change the direction of his studies quite abruptly. In 1906 he suspended his university registration and for 3 years he dedicated himself to studying Latin, Greek, ancient Egyptian, and Arabic. He then returned to university study, but this time in Göttingen and Königsberg where, for the next 2 years, he studied, inter alia , Semitology with Julius Wellhausen (1844-1918), and the renowned expert in Syriac and Palestinian Christian Aramaic Friedrich Schulthess (1868-1922). He also studied Egyptology with one of the greatest figures in Egyptian philology of the twentieth century, Kurt Sethe (1869-1934), and with Walter Wreszinski (1880-1935), author of the monumental three-volume Atlas zur Altaegyptischen Kulturgeschichte (Atlas of Egyptian Cultural History , 1923-28). 2 For a sustained assessment of the edition see Shakhnovic (2006). 3 See for Instance Moss (1984) and Perlina (2002). 4 Meyer was a corresponding member of the Russian and Soviet Academy of Science and had considerable influence on the development of ancient history in Russia, although his reception in the 1930s was quite varied.

Brandist Frank- Kamenetskij was awarded a doctorate in philosophy in 1911, and he remained in Germany until just before the outbreak of war in 1914, studying the papyrus collection in Berlin (Frank-Kamentzky 1914) and collecting material about the Egyptian cult of the god Amon. He wrote a monograph on the issue, based on hieroglyphic and manuscript materials held in the Berlin museum, which was published in two volumes (Frank-Kamenetskij 1917-1918). From the outbreak of war until March 1915, when he returned to Russia and was drafted into the army, he stayed in Denmark and Norway, continuing his library work, where he probably became acquainted with burgeoning Scandanavian folklorics, to which he was to return later.6 Frank-Kamenetskij was clearly already a significant scholar by the time of the Revolution, with detailed, first-hand knowledge of the most important philosophical and philological trends in Germany. After demobilisation from the Tsarist army in 1917 he began teaching at Irkutsk State University in the faculty of the history of the ancient orient. Following a brief period as a professor at Moscow State University in 1921, he moved to Petrograd where he would spend the rest of his life and where his subsequent career would become intimately entwined with the rise of Marrism. German orientalism and biblical scholarship Frank-Kamenetskij was trained by some of the most prominent German exponents of the historical approach to biblical studies of the era, first among whom one must highlight the rationalist Wellhausen, whose 1882 Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels laid the basis for much contemporary biblical criticism.7 One commentator noted that Wellhausen' s position in Old Testament criticism is "somewhat akin to that of Darwin in the intellectual history of modern times" in that he applied the comparative-historical method to biblical texts with considerable thoroughness and consistency, analysing literary and historic sources and employing them in a logically objective way (Hahn 1966, pp. 1 1-1 2). 8 The Pentateuchal documents were now revealed to be a combination of works produced at various points in the evolution of the religion of Israel, and he showed that critical analysis could reconstruct the historical process through which the later, more complex cultic forms arose from the simpler forms when life and religion were more fully integrated. This led Frank-Kamenetskij to credit Wellhausen with transforming biblical scholarship and making a scientific approach to biblical history possible (1927, p. 206). Yet, as Frank-Kamenetskij' s biography suggests, critical Biblical history was assimilated into a broader intellectual framework, and he followed 6 This information is given in the preface to the description of Frank-Kamenetskij' s fond in SPF ARAN: f.83 1 . 7 English translation: Wellhausen (1885). A Russian translation (Vel'gauzen 1909) was published by N. M Nikol'skij (1877-1959), perhaps the founder of critical Biblical scholarship in Russia. Among the appreciations of Wellhausen's work see Irwin (1944); Wikgren (1944) and Momigliano (1982). 8 It seems clear, however, that Wellhausen was actually a brilliant systématiser of the various German critical works on the Old Testament in the preceding period, and therefore holds a position analogous to that of Saussure in linguistics. On this see Rogerson (1984: 257-272). Springer</page><page sequence="5">The work of Izrail' Frank- Kamenetskij (1880-1937) 47 Meyer's advice that the "universal religions" which "claim to be world religions" are "so intertwined in their development that only an overall consideration that holds each in equal regard allows a full understanding of their history" (quoted in Tenbruch 1987, p. 244). Such an approach required a "theory of general forms of human life and human development" (quoted in Tenbruch 1987, p. 245), which Frank-Kamenetskij distilled from, inter alia, Wundt's work on the social determinants of trans-individual thought processes and Simmel's idea that religion emerges in social relations of particular intensity, in which the unity of the social group is expressed in religious terms. This immersion in social psychology and sociology was to shape the way in which Frank-Kamenetskij' s work developed in the coming years, but initially this was very much limited to semitology. According to the new critical scholarship, Biblical heroes were no longer viewed as historical figures but, in accordance with the development of comparative linguistics and evolutionary anthropology, the product of universal cultural development.9 Frank-Kamenetskij followed this analysis by tracing the connections of plot and metaphor between the cult of the god Amon and the Old Testament, in a series of articles that derived from his extensive work on Egyptology between 1914 and 1921, 'The Religion of Amon and the Old Testament' (1921) and 'Religious Syncretism in Egypt in the Theban Period' (1928 [1921]).10 In these works many parallels between Egyptian monotheism and that of the Old Testament were discerned, but two fundamental differences were detected: only in Israel were the old gods gradually negated by monotheism, and did the central principle shift from the might to the justice of the deity. Thus, while his conclusions often coincided with those of Wellhausen, Frank-Kamenetskij moved beyond Wellhausen's treatment of the rise of Old Testament religion as a self-contained phenomenon. In this he shared much with the generation of students that studied in Göttingen in the 1880s and 90s such as Hermann Gunkel and Ernst Troeltsch, who launched what became known as the 'religious-historical school'. This was a movement characterized by "its deep interest in oriental paganism, its critique of pure historicism in favour of a wider, one might say more folkloric understanding of traditions, and its neoromantic return to questions of origins" (Marchand 2009, p. 260).11 Along with close attention to new archaeological discoveries as a foil to philological analysis, this tended to erode the hitherto unquestioned assumption that literate and non-literate cultures were separated by an unbridgeable gulf and to see Biblical texts as relatively late compilations of much older folk stories, motifs and phrases that had been handed down through many generations orally (Marchand 2009, pp. 265-256). While potentially liberating, this movement gave ammunition to the increasing ranks of German scholars who adopted the categories of Indo-European or 9 Here we see traces of the psychological universalism that emerged among opponents of the hegemony of Indo-European philologists in comparative mythology and formed the basis of much materialist anthropology of the end of the nineteenth century. For general discussions see Stocking (1987) and Jahoda (1993). For a contemporary expression of this in Soviet scholarship see Nikol'skij's programmatic work (1923), which Frank-Kamenetskij also cites. Nikol'skij (1918) had already argued against the excessive identification of the figure of Christ and that of Egyptian gods. 11 For a detailed account see Lüdermann and Schröder (1987).

While a certain amount of overt anti- Semitism had been apparent in the field for some time, and was especially clear in Paul de Lagarde's attempts to cleanse Christianity of the 'distortions' of Judaism, the field became increasingly entangled with racist thinking in the period when Frank- Kamenetskij was studying in Germany. Key elements of the stories of the life of Christ were held to have derived from the life of Buddha, and its monotheism traced back to the alternative source of Zoroastrianism. Judaism was now sidelined as ossified or disintegrating at the time of the rise of Christianity and so opening itself up to foreign influences.12 Frank-Kamenetskij was inevitably concerned to counter the racist implications of such ideas while retaining its methodological innovations. Biblical myths In his analyses of biblical texts Frank-Kamenetskij rejected the arguments of Indo- European scholars that biblical stories were the result of borrowing from neighbouring cultures, and instead highlighted the accumulated deposits of the myths of the peoples who populated Palestine before the arrival of the Jews. In a series of articles and a short book in the mid 1920s, Frank-Kamenetskij argued that religious symbols derived from animistic modes of thought, that gradually lost their primordial sense, but the associated qualities are maintained in the notion of the divine (1925a, b, 1926a). Examples would be the anthropomorphism of the heavenly king, surrounded by warriors or heralds, and the naturalism of images such as spontaneous fire (the burning bush etc.) as an immediate cause of terror and as a source of heavenly light. In (1925) he published the short monograph Prophets and Miracle-Workers : On the Local Origins of the Myth of Christ (1925b), in which he directly engaged with the arguments of the anti-semitic trends within Indo-Europeanism by refuting their claim that the idea of the suffering god only reached Palestine shortly before the appearance of Christianity. Instead, New Testament stories were presented as literary developments of the motifs that had been outlined by Old Testament prophets, and which can, in turn, be traced back to foundational solar and water myths. Comparison of parallel structures in Judaism and ancient Egyptian religion led to the inescapable conclusion that the formative milieu of Old Testament religion extended beyond Israel itself, but if aspects had really been assimilated from abroad then Frank- Kamenetskij was keen to show that these elements often acquired a new conceptual significance and became bearers of distinctive beliefs. The core tenets of Christianity, he insisted, could be found in the mythology of ancient Palestine, and survivals of these myths could be found in Biblical poetry and stories: Among these we pay particular attention to the legends of Moses, Joshua, Elijah and Elisha, who are simultaneously prophets and miracle-workers, and served as the prototypes of the legendary character of Christ who, in turn, 12 Among the central texts, which went through several editions, are Bousset (1970 [1913]); Seydel (1882); For an overview see Marchand (2009, pp. 267-321). Springer</page><page sequence="7">The work of Izrail' Frank-Kamenetskij (1 880-1937) 49 appears in the role of prophet and of miracle- worker. . . The fantastic characteristics ascribed to Christ in the Gospels to a significant extent reveal motifs that in the Old Testament are confined to the heroes of prophetic legends. But the element of the miraculous in prophetic legend arose by means of a literary reworking of mythical plots that grew on the soil of the notion of the dying and resurrected god. (1925b, p. 11) Behind the façade of the alleged historical figures of prophetic legend Frank- Kamenetskij aimed to reveal the pagan Gods of ancient Palestine, whose images continued to live in the consciousness of worshippers of the victorious God of the Jews. They initially survived as tarnished demigods and then as the national heroes of the tales of law-givers and prophets. In presenting the emergence of the monotheistic form of religious consciousness, with its concentration on justice, as an achievement of the collective psychology of the people of Israel, Frank- Kamenetskij linked historical ideas developed by critical Old Testament scholarship to an argument that had been developed as early as 1860 by Haymann Steinthal, one of the founders of Völkerpsychologie , in his polemics with Ernest Renan (Steinthal I860).13 Biblical studies remained the centre from which Frank-Kamenetskij' s work expanded for the rest of his career, but he increasingly aimed to draw parallels between the development of Biblical and other myths. There were times, however, when his focus returned specifically to Biblical history and scholarship. Thus, in 1927 Frank-Kamenetskij authored the entry on the Bible for the first edition of the Large Soviet Encyclopaedia , where he argued that "the comparative study of biblical history has shown that the fundamental features of the religious life [byt] and thinking of the Jews can properly fit into the general scheme of the religious development of the classical East, and that the entire general culture of the Jews can only be properly understood against the common background of the cultural life that surrounds it". From this he concluded that the most pressing tasks of biblical scholarship was detailed study of what was unique in the Jewish case: "the particular sharpening of certain moments of religious consciousness, chiefly under the influence of complex socio-political relationships," on the one hand, and "its role in the process of the formation of Old-Testament religion and literature" on the other (1927: col. 207). On the few occasions when he engaged in the first line of research, his grounding in German sociology of religion became particularly clear, such as in his 1926 article The Prophet Jeramiah and the Struggle of Parties in Judea'. Here Frank-Kamenetskij endorses the work of Max Weber to argue that the ideas articulated by the figure of Jeramiah were an articulation of the perspective of the debt-ridden or entirely landless peasants struggling against the serfdom, priesthood and usurers that resulted from new forms of social organisation inherited from the Canaanites (1926b).14 13 See also Bunzl (2003: 68-70). 14 The reference is to Weber (1921). Springer</page><page sequence="8">50 C. Brandist Encounter with Marr Frank-Kamenetskij's objects of research began to diversify significantly following his encounter with Marr' s Japhetic theory on the eve of its transformation into the New Theory of Language in 1922. Marr had established himself as a formidable presence in philology with his monumental three-volume critical edition of the Armenian Parables of V ardan (1899) for which the Russian Geographic Society awarded him a gold medal. Here Marr illustrated many parallels between Armenian and Arabic and Syrian literary monuments, and he hypothesized the existence of genetic relations between Caucasian and Semitic languages and cultures. This led Marr to explore the link between etymology and the study of religious beliefs,15 but he was now moving beyond the völkerpsychologische notion that each people have their own unique and unfolding Vô'lksgeist that is embodied in its distinct language. Marr now developed an ideology critique of Indo-European philology as a trend intrinsically bound up with imperial domination. This chimed with Frank- Kamenetskij's experience of German religious studies in the period immediately before World War One, and he encountered Marr just as the latter was breaking decisively with the accepted framework of comparative philology (most notably the notion of the proto-language) and seeking typological parallels in semantic material in languages of communities who shared stages of socio-economic development rather than common lines of descent. For all its apparent radicalism, Marr' s 'semantic palaeontology', which held the inseparability of language, thought, and material culture and sought deposits of earlier stages of development in semantic material remained grounded in a pre-Saussurean philology that did not accept a special linguistic object domain. Rather, semantic material was subjected to the tools of archaeology and anthropology, with ideas from Herbert Spencer's Lamarckian writings on social evolution combined with Lucien Lévy-Bruhl's positivist account of mythical thought and Aleksandr Veselovskij's idea that all language and art originated in a primordial syncretism of rhythm and dance. To this was added a crucial ingredient which is relatively little explored in scholarship on Marrism: Ludwig Noiré's argument, derived from Schopenhauer, that word and thought constitute a "monon" that finds its transcendental precondition in the will, "the root of actuality" (quoted in Cloeren 1988, pp. 186-187). Will aims at communal actions which are, in turn, aimed at concrete things, while cognition deals with abstract concepts. Like money, words and concepts are "the abstract expression of pure work" and they contain the fruits of previous perception and thought as a sort of cognitive "capital". The stock of words and concepts at any given point in time bear the deposits of the ongoing "metaphorical transfer of sounds to the products of man's labour and to his perceptions".16 It is easy to see how this argument appealed both to neo-Kantians and to Marxists even while it was never fully liberated from 15 See, for instance, Marr (1915). 16 This account of Noiré's argument in Noiré (1885) is indebted to the critical account in Cloeren (1988: 180-98, 253). â Springer</page><page sequence="9">The work of Izrail' Frank-Kamenetskij (1880-1937) 51 Schopenhauer's metaphysics of will.17 The following quotation contains much of relevance to the development of Frank-Kamenetskij' s ideas: The emancipation of our thought from our desires and wants constitutes every advance towards theoretical knowledge, and it certainly follows thence, that originally thought was wholly coalesced with will; that percepts, accordingly, in the consciousness of primitive men, were not arranged in any causal, genetic, or intellectual connection, but simply in the order in which through instinctive impulses and emotion they had entered their various incidental or natural connections. The will for a long time remained absolute autocrat; all speech aimed at practical effects, sympathetical agreement, and incitation to common action. (Noiré 1917 [1885]: 43-44) The wide reception of Noirés ideas in Russia was conditioned by the fact that it was precisely at this time that Marxism was widely understood, following Plekhanov, to be a variant of Spinoza's monism.18 In Noiré's work Schopenhauer's 'will' essentially supplanted Spinoza's 'substance' as the underlying 'root of actuality', while attention was shifted to the instrumental character of human activity. This was the focus of his 1880 work The Tool and its Significance in the Development of Humanity, which appeared in Russian translation in 1925 and was regularly cited in support of the contention that language originated and developed in connection with the labour process (Noiré 1880; Nuare 1925). 19 Even where no such contentions were made, we still find Marxism being held as synonymous with 'materialistic monism' such as in Volosinov's sophisticated and well-known 1929 monograph Marxism and the Philosophy of Language (1995, pp. 255-56, 1973, p. 40). The Marrist combination of Noiré's ideas with a stadial theory of social development, according to which cultural forms are correlated with a series of socio-economic formations, made the Marxist credentials of the theory appear fairly secure, at least for a while. While undoubtedly an adherent to the main principles of Marrism, Frank- Kamenetskij still maintained elements of his philosophical training that rendered his ideas by no means identical with those of Marr. Indeed few scholars who were sympathetic to Marrism adhered to all Marr' s ideas, especially when they turned to ethnographic or narrative material. One example would be the folklorist Mark Azadovskij (1888-1954) who reduced Marr's method to three principles none of which were peculiar to Marrism: palaeontology, stadialism, and semantics (Azadovskij 1935, p. 13).20 As Nikonova notes, unlike Marr, but like Ernst Cassirer, 17 Thus Noiré's work was received very positively by, inter alia , Max Müller, Ernst Cassirer, Georgy Plexanov, Aleksandr Bogdanov and Nikolai Bukharin as well as Marr and his followers. 18 For a still valuable overview see Kline (1952). 19 On Schopenhauer's recasting of Spinoza's substance see Rappaport (1899) and Brann (1972). 20 Linguistic palaeontology had been associated with the work of the Indo-Europeanist scholars Max Müller and especially Adolphe Pictet. For brief discussions see Ölender (1992: 82-105) and, in connection with Marr, Tchougounnikov (2005). However, the idea had specifically been severed from Indo-Europeanism and applied to folk narratives by Andrew Lang in his famous polemics with Müller (Lang 1884), which influenced Veselovskij and through him, Marr. Marr was, however, the most prominent representative of the idea in the USSR at the time. Stadialism was connected both to the Ö Springer</page><page sequence="10">52 C. Brandist Frank-Kamenetskij viewed the transition from one form of thinking to another as a dynamic process generated by the very activity of human thinking and involving a Hegelian sublation ( Aufhebung ), or cancelling and absorption of the earlier mode of thought into the succeeding mode (Nikonova 2003, p. 65). He also saw intermediate stages and phases within each stage that can be reconstructed by analysing the traces of typological features found in the data of either ancient languages or through the comparative analysis of myths and folklore. Frank-Kamenetskij thus tended to adapt elements of Marrism to his own philosophical positions and to view the potentials of the theory from his own grounding in the study of religious symbolism and legends. Furthermore, the tradition of meticulous attention to textual detail that characterised German Biblical scholarship was something that Frank-Kamenetskij maintained throughout his career and this training inoculated him against the extravagances of Marrism. To a significant extent Frank-Kamenetskij returned Marxist theory to its roots, and renewed its connections with the rigors of anthropology and mythology. Just as in his earliest philological work, Marr had made a significant contribution as long as he remained grounded in textual material, so Frank-Kamenetskij was able to advance the semantic palaeontology of ancient texts. The evolution of religious conceptions For Frank-Kamenetskij, Marr' s idea of the 'single glottogonic process' had laid a firm basis for the employment of the data of linguistic analysis in illuminating the origins and development of religious notions, but development depended on close study of concrete materials. Accepting Marr' s assertion that "the history of material culture as a whole, as a product of social creation, is inseparably connected with the history of human speech," in 1927 he set up a special section of Marr' s Institute of Language and Thought to conduct "organised and systematic research" into the problem of "the entwinement of language and material culture (desmotics [desmotika])" (SPF ARAN 853/1/86/16). The goals of desmotics were defined as "(1) the illumination of the character of the connection between the history of human speech and material culture and (2) the determination of the forms this connection is strengthened both in language and in the monuments or complex of monuments of material culture" (SPF ARAN 853/l/86/16ob.). The section involved the linguist I. I. Mescaninov, the archaeologists A. A. Miller (1883-1967) and B. L. Bogaevskij, and the classicist O. M. Freidenberg. Desmotics involved the further development of Marr's functional semantics to discern the "character of the connection between naming and the object named, clarifying the social form of everyday life ( byt ) and labour." Frank-Kamenetskij now embedded 'Biblical literature' within the project (SPF ARAN 853/1/86/17), resulting in the article Toward a Cosmological Semantics of "Stones" and "Metal"4, which was Footnote 20 continued positivist theories of culture associated with figures such as Comte and Spencer, the latter of whom exerted a direct influence on Marr, and certain trends of Marxist thought which often borrowed from positivist narratives. Semantics, of course, has a protracted history that is impossible even to summarize here. Springer</page><page sequence="11">The work of Izrail' Frank-Kamenetskij (1880-1937) 53 published in a posthumous volume dedicated to Marr in 1935 (Frank-Kamenetskij 1935b). Such work led Frank-Kamenetskij increasingly to work on theoretical questions from the end of the 1920s. This began with measured evaluations of German scholarship and a search for alternative ways to conceptualize the relations between myths and religion that had been pursued by scholars of Indo-Europeanism like Max Müller, while drawing on their empirical observations. The first sustained theoretical engagement was a 1929 article on Ernst Cassirer's work on language and myth, which seemed to provide a philosophical basis for Marxists to view mythology and mythical thinking as necessary stages in the development of human thought and language rather than something specific to racial or ethnic groups. This article undoubtedly exerted a considerable influence on Marrist scholars like Freidenberg (Perlina 2002, pp. 88-95), it may well also have provided an indication of how Cassirer's ideas could be applied in literary history for Bakhtin when he was working on his essays on the novel in the 1930s. Yet for all the evident respect Frank-Kamenetskij held for Cassirer, and the coherence his philosophical anthro- pology helped to bestow on Marr' s notion of 'diffuse' semantics, Frank- Kamenetskij maintained a certain detachment from Cassirer's work. Lévy-Bruhl and Cassirer had developed an elaborate classification of the forms of mythical thinking and characterizations of the ways in which this is transformed in various stages of social and cultural evolution, but Frank-Kamenetskij (1929, p. 142) argued that unlike these thinkers, Japhetic theory refrained from speculation and drew conclusions only from linguistic data subjected to paleontological analysis. It was actually from Noiré rather than Cassirer that Frank-Kamenetskij derived the guiding idea that metaphor is the fundamental mechanism in the formation of language and verbal culture. Like Noiré, he saw metaphor as grounded in the fundamental recognition that man's actions are related to the visual effects of his actions, and that it works through binary opposition (rich/poor, left/right, cause/effect etc.). Mythopoesis (mifotvorcestvo) was now seen as a direct result of primitive man's perception, which divided the world into three realms: the heavens, the earth, and the transitional space in between. Shared spatio-temporal connections give rise to named binary oppositions such as light and darkness, up and down, left and right. This perception was initially governed by syncretism or diffuseness, the law of the identity of the part and whole, which allowed the substitution of the whole and any of its parts and led to the development of fantastic modes of consciousness. This is because the isolation of notions and concrete features, the separation of the existent and non-existent, and the very cognition of the features themselves were impossible for primitive man who remained passive in the face of natural forces. Paleontological analysis reveals the polysemy of linguistic terms that embody religious notions, for 'language, in line with myth, plays an active, creative role in working out a notion about the world, reflecting the process of the gradual and multiple dismemberment of the primordial diffuse image-notion, that is the point of departure for the development of human consciousness' (Frank-Kamenetskij 1929, p. 110). Religious notions remain inseparable from the general process of the cognition of the world in the period preceding the rise of oral/aural speech which, as in Noiré' s theory, accompanies the development of collective labour. At the initial Springer</page><page sequence="12">54 C. Brandist stage of the development of oral/aural speech the name of the totem incorporated all grammatical persons within a single third person, thus rendering any distinction between subject and object impossible. Subject, object and grammatical persons become differentiated with the development of tribal society and transformation from matriarchy to patriarchy (Frank-Kamenetskij 1932, p. 274), and it is at this time that religious notions as such become isolated, recognized, and reformulated. This leads to the consolidation of animistic notions, in which the previously inherited worldview is reformulated according to the new ideology. The ultimate stabilisation of the mythical image is the result of the crossing (skrescenie) of perspectives that date back to different stages of the development of the economy and of society. These developing capacities are traced in connection with the process of the organisation of human labour according to a single rhythm, which leads to the formation of a single, regulated stream of impressions.21 This provided the precondition for the isolation and cognition of the phenomena of internal and external experience. The further isolation of distinct phenomena progresses along with the development of material culture, which the researcher needs to correlate with the development of linguistic categories. To the unity of the process of linguistic poesis corresponded the process of the development of religious notions. Just as semantic paleontology could reveal the stadial history of linguistic phenomena, so stages in the development of religious conceptions could also be revealed. Marr's idea of semantic series, i.e. series of meanings bound together by a single sound complex, found a parallel in the analysis of mythological images and plots, revealing the rule-governed conditioning of religious notions. The develop- ment of the economy and society more generally could be seen as reflected in the process of thinking (SPF ARAN 853/1/62/28). From myth through folklore to literature The consideration of myth and the development of religious conceptions ultimately led Frank-Kamenetskij towards a consideration of literary form. Looking back on his early work in 1933, Frank-Kamenetskij noted that his initial focus had been narrow, but that it had raised the more general problem of the relationship between mythological and poetic creation, the convergence and difference between poetical metaphors and those metaphors that lie at the basis of the mythical image. He was struck by the appearance of the same poetic images in the literature of widely divergent peoples and that parallel linguistic semantics and mythological notions could be found everywhere. He had therefore rejected the notion that poetic metaphor is the product of the productive fantasy of this or that poet and instead looked for the rule-governed nature of the process of development of poetic metaphor (SPF ARAN 853/1/53/13-15). This development was already in its initial stages in the mid 1920s when, after accepting Marr's controversial theory of the connection between Georgian and the Semitic languages he already knew well 21 Here the influence of Bücher (1896) is evident. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">The work of Izrail' Frank-Kamenetskij (1880-1937) 55 (Frank-Kamenetskij 1937), Frank-Kamenetskij began learning Georgian and studying the religious narratives of 'Japhetic' peoples. This resulted in his articles 'The Georgian Parallel to the Ancient Egyptian narrative "On Two Brothers'" (1925c) and 'On the Water and Tree Nature of Osiris' (Frank-Kamenetzky 1928) in which he outlined the underlying mythical plot common to each culture. Local gods were now but instances of larger cosmic deities that were gradually displaced through developing knowledge about the world. This was further developed in his posthumously published article 'Adam and Purusha: Microcosm and Macrocosm in Judaic and Indian Cosmogony' (1938). Frank-Kamenetskij played a leading role in two groups at two Leningrad institutions from the mid- 1920s: the 'group for the study of myths and literary plots' at Marr's Japhetic Institute and the "group for the paleontology of literary devices and plots" at the Institute for the Comparative History of the Literatures and Languages of the West and East (Naucno-issledovatel' skij institut sravnitel' noj istorij literatur i iazykov Zapada i Vostoka, ILIaZV 1925-30; formerly A. N. Veselovskii Institute (Institut im. A. N. Veselovskogo 1921-1925); subsequently State Institute for Discursive Culture ( Gosudarstvennyi institut rechevoj kul'tury , GIRK 1930-33)) (SPF ARAN 77/1/35/5). While the influence of Veselovskij's Historical Poetics was strong in both institutes, there was a sustained attempt to move beyond the limitations of Veselovskij's combination of Volkerpsychologie and positivism. Special, and critical attention was devoted to the work of, inter alia , Müller, Cassirer, Kaarle Krohn (1863-1933), the founder of the so-called "Finnish historical-geographical method," the Norwegian folklorist Moltke Moe (1859-1913), and Carl Meinhof (1857-1944), then regarded as one of the most authoritative scholars of African languages in Europe.22 In bringing together folklorists, linguists, and literary scholars with Frank-Kamenetskij' s expertise in philosophy and oriental studies in order to study the leading theoretical approaches to plot and narrative, the groups facilitated crucial critical engagements with a range of scholarly approaches. One of the better- known products of this work is the sustained and still valuable critique of the 'Finnish School' of folktale scholarship, which is helpfully summarized by Heda Jason (1970). Folklorists working at ILIaZV participated in the group and then employed ideas emerging from discussions in their own fields. Thus, A. I. Nikiforov (1893-1942), N. P. Andreev (1892-1942) and Propp developed sustained critiques of how Krohn and his followers had worked on the assumption that each folktale is derived from an archetypal tale composed by an individual, that it migrates and degenerates. The Russian critics showed that such a conception is based on an unverifiable assumption and replaces a consideration of the historical development of texts and genres with a mechanical movement traced through space. Instead of seeking an original inventor, the transformations of plot and metaphor needed to be correlated with the shift in social consciousness from with through folklore to literature, as the ideological superstructures of pre-class, feudal and then capitalist society. In studying how religious notions become separated from other aspects of worldview made systematic consideration of the relationship between mythical and 22 On the work of the figures discussed see, inter alia, Pugach (2001), Hautala (1968), Stromback et al. (1971) and Wilson (1976). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="14">56 C. Brandist literary plot and metaphor inescapable. Looking back on what Marrism offered his area of study, Frank-Kamenetskij argued that "Mart's theory of the single glottogonic process" posed a new task for those studying metaphor and plot, "the problem of the derivation and transformation of folkloric motifs from the shifts of successive stages of development of society and worldview" (SPF ARAN 77/1 (1934)/21/64). While the specificities of a national culture need to be recognised, they now needed to be viewed as the result of historical development, with each culture 'passing through the same stages, but complicated in each particular region by the specific conditions of space and time and authentically completed through interactions and influences' (1935a, p. 113). The deepening division between mental and manual labour and the rise of class society leads mythical plot forms to become 'rationalized', first into forms of folklore and ultimately into poetic or literary forms. The structure of myth as plot construction is sedimented into paleontological semantics, as a 'survival' in the sense developed by Tylor. This structure reflects the primordial, diffuse character of thinking of the age of its formation, but in ages when religious notions have become compartmentalized from general conceptions of the world, the inherited mythical notions are no longer understood. Instead, mythical notions are reformulated into a series of plot constructions where rational explanation comes to dominate. The ramifications of these developments for literary studies led, in 1932, to the publication of the collective volume Tristan and Isolda . From the Heroine of Love of Feudal Europe to the Matriarchal Goddess of Afroeurasia which aimed "to reveal the sociogenesis of the mythological plot that appears in the religious beliefs and folkloric materials of a rather large area and which also finds its reflection in poetry, especially in the mediaeval novel about Tristan and Isolda, with the aim of working out the problems of stadiality within the limits of the paleontology of myth and folklore" (Frank-Kamenetskij 1932, p. 263). As the title suggests, the structure and images of the romance were subjected to semantic "excavation" and traced back through various and multiple transformations of the plot to the "foundational core" of motifs or "semantic clusters" found in the myth of the "Afroeurasian" goddess Ishtar (also known as Inanna and Astarte). These clusters derived from a symbiosis of perceptions in the primitive mind. Focus on the structural elements of the narrative, motifs and metaphors, revealed the same features in classical, ancient oriental and Caucasian stories. It also showed that the transformations of plot were linked to shifts in social practice from matriarchy (pre-class society) to patriarchy (early class society) and then to feudal relations: At the stage of matriarchy poetic creation is not distinguished from the general process of cognizing the world, it does not move beyond the limits of mythical images, of their combination and interaction. With the development of the patriarchal-tribal system, on the soil of and already socially stratified society, we see the transfer of mythological conceptions to the real holders of power, the chief, then the tribal leader. The process is completed in feudal society with the rise of the pseudo-everyday plot, which preserves the basic schemes of the mythological conceptions, but with the gods replaced by real people, representatives of the ruling class. (1932, p. 266) Springer</page><page sequence="15">The work of Izrail' Frank-Kamenetskij (1880-1937) 57 The central motif of sexual union is, in the mythological plot, a metaphor for the productive powers of nature with any notion of marriage absent. The antithesis of the life and death of nature is presented in the image of the dying and resurrected god in parallel male (Tammuz) and female (Ishtar) aspects, with the latter dominant. With the shift to patriarchy and the development of the family, union takes the form of marriage between individual people, with the dominant role shifting from the woman to the tribal leader and husband, and rational explanations begin to govern the plot. This shift becomes completed in the feudal romance when the plot is reformulated as one of the deadly consequences of prohibited love and the violation of trust in marriage. Following and adapting Marr's functional semantics, according to which a sound complex denoting an object is transferred to another object that assumes the social function of that object,23 Frank-Kamenetskij argues that while the plot-scheme remains constant, what was the content of myth becomes the form of poetry, with a transitional folkloric stage in which the form bears a new social significance (1932, pp. 267-68). As he explained in a lecture 1 year after the publication of the collection: [T]hat which, on a mythological basis, appears as content, acquires the character of the form of a poetic work and already has a different content when on a poetic basis. But changes of content draw changes in form behind it, or else there would be a separation of form and content. This new form also distinguishes the poetic metaphor from metaphor on a mythological basis. (SPF ARAN 853/l/53/48a) By the time of the feudal romance sexual union is thus no longer a metaphor for the productive powers of nature but, on the contrary, the productive power of nature is a metaphor for sexual union. What has occurred is a 'rationalization' of the mythical plot, with cosmic relationships replaced by social relationships, and a consequent shift from myth towards realism. It was not until 1935, however, that Frank-Kamenetskij published an extended work on the development of poetic metaphor in which he elaborated the theoretical principles of his approach (Frank-Kamenetskij 1935c). Reversing Aristotle's scheme, he argues there is a historical and cognitive progression from primordial identity through comparison to analogy, with identity arising in those primitive eras when formal logic and concepts were still to be developed. Metaphor had a cognitive function, the knowing of the concrete through the concrete at a time when knowledge of the concrete through the abstract was still impossible. Poetic metaphor has a different character, however, since while it is still knowledge of the concrete through the concrete, it takes place at a time when knowledge of the concrete through the abstract, i.e. through concepts, is already possible. It therefore arose as a rational- ization of mythical identity. As he noted in an early version of the 1935 article: It is not only poetic metaphor that moved along this path, but all the whole movement of worldview... Of course, the concept is a historical category, it is 23 See Mescaninov's (Meshchaninov 2010 [1927]: 178) summary: 'Shifts in the meaning of a given word depend upon the changing role of the designated object in the society that uses it. Thus, a word acquires its meaning in the social milieu that surrounds it. When a function shifts from one object to another, the latter object acquires the designation of the former (functional semantics and semantic series)'. Springer</page><page sequence="16">58 C. Brandist the result of a specific historical process. The formation of a concept can only be understood when one has shown its precursors. The problem of the development of poetic metaphor, the problem of the development of a metaphor, is not limited by the term 'poetic', it is the flip side of the problem of the development of a concept. (SPF ARAN 853/1/53/46) The theme was developed further in another article published in 1935 'Separation as a Metaphor of Death in Myth and Poetry' (1935d) and finally in the posthumously published monograph on the genesis of the plot of Romeo and Juliet. Together these works show that in his final years Frank-Kamenetskij was becoming a pioneer of a new type of literary scholarship which sought to establish the preconditions for literature as such, and combined close attention to the morphology of plot and metaphor with an attention to historical transformations in social life. One can only speculate how this would have developed had Frank- Kamenetskij not been killed in a road accident in June 1937.24 Frank-Kamenetskij' s work found partial development in Freidenberg's studies of classical literature, Ieremiia Ioffe's (1888-1947) synthetic history of art (see Nikonova 2003 and Korolev 2006), Viktor Zirmunskij's work on comparative literature and, to some extent, in Bakhtin's work on carnival and the history of literary genres (See Brandist, forthcoming). Each of these figures, however, made important and original contributions in their own rights, and Frank-Kamenetskij' s work needs to be seen as a contribution to ongoing dialogues between scholars of a comparable status. A comprehensive study of the variety of works carried out under the banner of semantic palaeontology in the USSR in the inter-war period is long overdue. Further influence on the Tartu School is also possible, for Iurij Lotman was one of the first to draw attention to the significance of Frank-Kamenetskij' s work in the 1960s, albeit as an aside in an article on Freidenberg (Lotman 1974). However, as can be seen from the case of the Soviet folklore scholars, his influence was not limited to the impact of his own publications, but also due to the research projects he both coordinated and participated in. As such it reminds us that however much one seeks to affect our understanding of intellectual history by drawing attention to the work of neglected individuals, ultimately a more adequate approach needs to be underlain by a study of the social and institutional structures within which such ideas arose and found their resonance. 24 For the first systematic examination of semantic paleontology and its significance for Soviet literary studies in the 1930s, see Galin Tihanov's sections on semantic paleontology in Dobrenko and Tihanov (forthcoming 201 1).
