Tomas XXXVII (1—3), 85—109 (1983) HERAKLES-VERETHRAGNA AND THE MI'BAJ OF RUSTAM BY GIANROBERTO SCARCIA (Venice) In a recent survey of Shinbär we attempted to demonstrate, in fact merely to show — indicating the evidence — that those famed (but not too often visited) reliefs of the Parthian age do not offer, in themselves, any iconographical attestation of a part taken by the Hellenistic-Roman Herakles in the Iranian haoma rite. Nor do they provide footholds of any sort in favour of the identification between Herakles and Verethragna — a hypothesis often brought forth in order to clarify the more plausible function assumed by Herakles himself in Iran. And, seizing the occasion, we offered an interprétation of our own of the Commagenic synchretism which lies at the basis of that hypothesis.1 All this, however, does not imply that the said hypothesis lacks all plausibility in itself, were it not but for the fact that, at least in one occasion, and minimally in the astral sphere (in Commagene proper, and in nearby Armenia) the identification — in a direct or indirect fashion as the case may be — was effected ; nor can reasons of theme and of symbology suffi ce to disprove it patently, and at first sight. Thus, having cleared tlie field of ail elements that remain incurably gratuitous, we ourselves should like to indicate anew a few possible points of contact between the two divine figures under discussion. We are referring to the possible association of Herakles (obviously in his aspect — of Dyonisiac-funerary and Orphic-Odyssean para-Christian character2 — as conqueror of the force of gravity of human death through the pyre) with that instrument of apotheosis which is represented by the Wind : and possibly the same Wind — if the latest naturistic sources on the issue are 1 G.

G. Patroni, La morte di Eracle e alcuni concetti dell'OUretomba, in Rendiconti . . . Morali . . . Lincei, Serie VI, col. III, 1927, pp. 629 — 670) is of course irrelevant from the point of view of the late Hellenistic developments of the Symbol. It would however be very interesting to hold an accurate investigation in «Shamanic» context — and possibly in that which would seem to have been the natural «birthplace» of the latter- on the «several other détails showing similarities» between Herakles and the Mongolian Geser, particularly in relation to the «final task» of both heroes, i.e. descent «into the Underworld». From a phenomeno logical Standpoint, in other words, we might find more «direct connections» than are usually seen in a historical light, among «Oriental» and «Western» cases.

And the Zurvanite theme-pattern is well attested in another great épisode — this time far from hypothetical — of meeting between the cultures of adjoining worlds, which is constituted by the legend of the Kings at Bethlehem and the conséquent birth (connected with the return trip of the Kings from Bethlehem)10 of the fire Gushnäsp : a fire — we might add parenthetically — which springe from the earth in the very moment in which the three Kings, or the three âges of Mankind — prototypes as they were of Julian in front of the temple of Ilyâ-Jerusalem to be returned —11 are about to transmit to the earth itself, in the shape of «amânat», the Eucharistical message of grâce and salvation received in the cave. The Phrygian cap of the Kings is a third Mithraising element,12 which in an isolated, and very doubtful, case at Dura appears to Cover the head of Herakles himself ;13 however a pseudo-Herakles Albani of Begrâm appears with little doubt to be assimilated to Ganimedes,14 another famous bearer of the cap, and a well-known traveller of the Heavens at that.15 Intense contact, in brief, and in a Mithraising eontext, may be recorded between the two elements of the Vikanderian pair Old Man * Thie double iconography may also be found, albeit diachronically, in the type of the Greek Hermes, bearded in the archaic âge and of Ephebie type in later times.

SCARCIA Wind (Zäl-Garshäsp), while the connections Herakles-Wind, and Herakles Hermes, seem similarly promising from a phenomenological standpoint. Further : in his migration to the East, Herakles is once forced to face obstacles (of the telluric-seismic type)16 similar to those encountered by the Sistanic hero par excellence of the Garshâsp «type» in his pathway : a hero also strongly connected with the Yayu-Zurvân pair, taken both individually and together.17 In the same way as, in other cases, the mount (the bearer) might represent the god (the borne),18 the name of Herakles might in its turn take on the function of the Aeolic mount which transports him, the functionof «domp teur du vent».19 Ail this, of course, is far from exceeding the substance of a mere hint but if hints must have been présent for an assimilation of Herakles to Vereth ragna, we must not forget that the first manifestation of Yerethragna was precisely that of a streng and beautiful wind, bearer of Glory, Health, and Power.20 In a short contribution to the International Seminar dedicated to the 900th anniversary of the birth of Sanâ'î of Ghazna, held in Kabul, Oct. 17 — 23, 1977, we indicated in fact a few possible traces of survival, in Iranian territory under Islamic influence, of an idea of the Wind as instrument of mïrâj in the fashion of Late Antiquity. These traces are not immediately evident, for the Islamic mi'räj h as been almost totally absorbed in the rather mysterious image of Burâq — the prophétie mount, which has been and still is the object of widespread debate —21 sometimes accompanied by the cortege of minor steeds, of the ablaq type, destined for minor prophets or pseudoprophets.22 16 Cf.

We have thus indicated, in the context of a célébration of Sanä'i in the country of Vayu,23 the possible function of mi'räj taken up by the wind. To this Wind, curiously no doubt, goes the invocation with which the poet of Ghazna (XI cent.) inaugurâtes his «Dantesque» heavenly journey (Sair al-'ibäd 'ilä-'l ma'äd). We provide here a translation24 of this passage : it may be useful to clarify the, discussion, if only because it forced us to make clear choices with regards to a sometimes ambiguous, and consistently amphibological, text. Of course a habit to the streng rhetoric of Persian poetic culture may function as a screen in our reading, in the sense that a Wind-messenger may appear as an obvious, expected and almost flat poetical image. In thë same way, a scholastic and rigidly theological interprétation might reduce this polymorphous and unquiet wind, which is air and fire together — as Moulänä Balkhi would put it — , which is captive and song, as Masrüd-i Sa'd would say, to a mere allegory of the Spirit, the Breath, which goes and comes (and here it is necessary to recall Sardï but also the vayu ävcarishn barishn of Bundahishn III). And, finally, it must be admitted that in these verses there is a clear (even too clear) monotheistic intention of repeating that the presumed Creator is créature, that even before his blind omniscience there is always one whose knowledge is deeper. However, if we pay attention to the contents — but also to the objective position — of the invocation, we will be Struck by two essential features, far from obvious in themselves : on one hand, the absolute dramatic (and eosmogonical) character — of the Zurvanite type — of the idea of cosmic lead us however to think of a particular Iranian sensibility as regards the «spotted» coat of the hero's horse (on this theme, most reeently, G. Curatola, Sudore di Sangue, pp. 213 — 216 ; В. Zekijan, «Barak» nell'armeno claesico, pp. 217 — 221 ; G. Bellingeri, Sul pro totipo iranico del «Kir-al», pp. 223 — 245 ; all in Studi Iranici, Roma 1977) ; if, of course, the ablaq (abraq) was not preferred simply because of the assonance with barak, «steed» with no further spécification, perhaps by reason of the fonctions referred to in Dätietän-i dïnïk, 30 — 2. We must however keep in mind the ashqar of Bähräm Gür (on which cf. below) which as such (roan) reminds us both Herakles' dog and of the eagle of Zeus. 23 The observation (Kabul —Bädäbäd) has been made to us by ЦаЫЫ, as a complé ment of our own : a significant coïncidence, that of speaking of Vayu apropos of a poet of Ghazna of the time of Bahräm-shäh !

The last line: (ظ يداي َتح يرجم رام يد عه جز حون نو باد يند) is frankly rather ambiguous, and we have followed the scholastic interpretation for it in Our translation. It might be equally possible to read- in fact, in a veryliteral inter pretation: Whoever is not Barn (ie. whoever is not Yourself, or like You) may not legitimately bear the name of Wind.25 Intentionally or not on the part of Sanä'i, there is по doubt that the invocation is concluded by this impressive association between the Word Bad and the Word Bäm, an association which inevitably recalls the case of Yasht XV.2® And this entire introduction might, by the way, consist in a paraphrase of the latter, or — if preferable, but not too differently — in a transfigurating, i.e. monotheistical, reinterpretation. 6؛To be kept in mind is also the assonance Bähräm-räm, perhaps responsible as such of theme contiguity. The parallel case, in Sana'!, of Iblisjtalbie, although equally justified in substance, шау take part of the eharm away from the verse tigh birun кип 02 kqf-i Bahrämjtundiyi й batigh-i ü кип räm, in the final invocation of the Hadiqa, which is an exhortation to the earthly Bahram, gracious and benign, vs. the heavenly Bahram, i.e. the planet in which should be Seen, Persie dicentibus, those Herakles and Mars who are Artagnes and Ares.

SCAKCIA On the other hand, we would like to indicate, after the équation with Vayu and the parallelism with Râm, a further step in the «sliding» of the mythical imagery, and to this purpose we should fix our attention on line 7, which is absent in some manuscripts, and which in général is ignored even by the ancient commentators. A wind «father of Jesus» is obviously the Holy Spirit ; but the tight association with the mount of Jamshïd, i.e. in fact with the instrument of the mi'räj, brings us to ask whether the Sair al-'ibäd does not, in fact, open with the invocation to the wind also and precisely because the wind is felt as an instrument of mi'räj (heavenly journey) par excellence. And, on this line of thought, is Hermes psychopomp because he protects pathways and crossroads27, or rather for his possible «naturistic» origins? His presence, fréquent during the «Labours», but actually constant during the flight of Herakles to the Olympus,28 cannot certainly be casual. And one may also recall the peculiar Hermes which bears in arm the infant Herakles29 — almost as is the case of Christ, who, in the frescoes of the Dormitio Virginie above the doorposts (barzalch) of almost all the Christian-Orthodox churches and chapels, bears the soul of his deceased mother in the aspect of an infant, reduced in size to «daughter of her son». It is true that Hermes also bears Dyonisus, in similar iconographies with presumably similar functions, but Dyonisus (and here a further reason for the well known Dyonisiac symbol of an ass might make its appearance : the vortex of dance?), as is well known. is not too far from Herakles30; and in any case what counts is the type of action — psychopomp — which the wind сап effect also as regards other characters.31 27 Cf. (although slightly axiomatical on the subject), Enciclopedia dell'Arte classica e Orientale IV, D. V. 28 Cf. P. Mingazzini, Le rappresentazioni vascolari del mito dell'apoteosi di Herakles, in Memorie . . . Morali . . . Lincee, Serie VI, Vol. I, 1925 — 1926, (pp. 413 — 490), passim. 29 On this function, cf. again Enciclopedia IV, p. 6. 30 Mingazzini, op. cit., p. 486 : «Non ci meraviglieremo dunque se nel cratere di Monaco vedremo rappresentati, al disotto délia scena del rogo e del carro trionfale vo lante verso l'Olimpo, Dionysos fra le Menadi». 31 It is significant that the iconography under discussion always accompanies funerary scenes. In our brief work quoted in n. 15 (Osservazioni svll'iconografia e la sim bologia dei soprarchi con angeli e draghi del caravanserraglio di Ganj'ali-khân a Kirmän, II), we suggest to interpret some Safavid angels as psychopomp and the infants held by them on their laps as soûls. This coïncides in part with a différent suggestion repeatedly brought forth by Sch. V. R. Camman (Cosmic Symbolism on carpets from the Sanguszko group, in Etudies in-Art and Lüerature of Near East, in honor of Richard Ettinghausen, editor P.

But in Semitic antiquity, and before the Sasanid world launched the pair represented by the hero-warrior/aè/a# horse, which so often is to be found later on, the prophets mounted a humbler animal, of long known and domesticated : exactly the mount of Christ, the ass on which he rides into Jerusalem. «Etant donné que le cheval est l'animal aryen par excellence»,33 the horse will be prédominant also in Islamic Iran, and then in Iranized Islam, but its predecessor reappears, aided in this by the demonizing opération, ready to «dégradé», in an eschatological interprétation : the ass of Dajjäl at the end of time.34 The ass, then, historically précédés the horse. The discussion on the «Satanic» vs. positive nature of the ass in the Near Eastern context, and later in the Christian one, is far from over even today, despite a fine essay such as the one by Frejdenberg.35 But the former interprétation (Guenon),36 although finding some support in the land of Egypt, is certainly not upheld from a phenomenological viewpoint by nether-world functions such as that of the Indian Nairrita, for in fact the rôle of «guardian of the reign of the dead» is not lacking in semiotic duplicity.37 And, by the way, this view of the Satanic sign of the ass is forced to pivot on the shift of sexual marker, to justify the ass In this, the most interesting element for us is provided by the parallel onager : bird (as if the wild ass, «alinost a bird», were feit as particularly suited for that flight) ; and also by the possibility of findirig ourselves here in front of the already noted (above and cf. also n. 19, 53), and plausible, transfer between bearer and borne elements. 32 It is a véritable formula ; cf. Piemontese, op. cit., p. 111. 33 From here the hypothetical arye-bär of Nyberg, in JA CCXIV (1929), pp. 246 — 247. 34 A Christian parallel might possibly be recognized in the Beast of the Apocalypse of John. 35 O. M. Frejdenberg, V"ezd v Ierusalim na osle, [1923, and 1930—1933], now in Mif i literatura drevnosti, Moskva 1978, pp. 491 — 531. 35 Cf. J. Chevalier-A.

The two winds, both the raging one and the râm, are both psychopomp in Iran: their destination-netherworlds or heavens- is the sole va riant. Camman, in the passages quoted above, considère the onagers (gur-gaur, by figurative transposition of a tajnïs-i nâqïs) as a symbolization of the soul destined to the netherworld, whereas the bird should represent the soul destined to heaven. And in this he bases himself also on a colour opposition : dark in the former, light in the latter case. For us — while onager and bird seem to be the saine thing, i.e. the same sigh (cf. n. 31) — this opposition seems a very clear intimation of the double character of the angel as successor of the double Vayu (which equals to saying, also, of the minimally double Zurvän, who perhaps finde, also, some colour variants ; cf.

SCARCIA (she-ass) which bears Christ to Jerusalem, whereas the maie ass of the Manger — similarly to the wild ass of Camman — would be the démon, «overeome» by the benevolent Ox which opposes him in that place. But — we may ask — is not the wicked (prodigal) wife of Pausanias' Ocnos a she-ass? And if, in the Bible, Jvdges 5 : 10 exalts specifically the white she-asses, and a she-ass is in Balaam's épisode, it does not seem possible — on the other hand — to deduct any negative thought in the Bible itself concerning the male ass. To the contrary ; so as justify Carducci, «Do you recall ardent Arabia and the pavillionsj of Job, where you grew, audacious emulatorj in span and courage of the steeds?». Not to speak of the comparison (Genesis 16 : 12) between Ishmael and the onager.38 Ambivalence, or rather a simple ambivalent functional potentiality may also be shown through the attribution of the ass both to the Messiah and to the Antichrist. Here, the relation of absolute contiguity — in fact, of interchange — between the mounter and the mount préserves the echo of the relation between Balaam and the she-ass also in a few peculiar but significant «New Testament» transpositions :3e cf. the closed eye of a Balaam made Christian as St. Xavier of Aix, to which corresponds further the shut (blind) eye of the ass of Dajjâl. In brief, demonizations and total overturnings of values are possible, and the Hellenistic novel can offer both the Evangelical version (novel of moral édification) and its Apuleian version (pornographie novel) of the reinterpreta tion of the Near Eastern myth, as efficaciously shown by Frejdenberg ; but the story of the ass cuit maintains its unitary character, as betrayed by numerous recurring détails. We have quoted the closed eye which migrâtes from Balaam to the ass of Dajjâl, but one might also, for example, follow a motif such as that of the donkey's hoof, which in Islam was believed to be object of vénération in Palestine («märä . . . ma'badï hast, dar й bäshad kunün sïsad summ-i khar murasm jumla bä yäqut и gauhar,» says Khuwärizmx)40 Now, this asinine hoof undoubtedly stands here in place of the donkey's head venerated in Jerusalem according to another tradition, and the link between the two is provided by the «fertilizing» funetion of the jaw of the ass itself, which is tied to the motif of the hoof as a container for the drawing of water.41 In particular as regards the elevatio ad aerern by asinine means, further observations may be added even to the abundant ones quoted by Frejdenberg. 38 Frendenberg (op. cit., pp. 518 — 519) offers more plausible explanations, although more obvious ones, for the presence of the ass and the she-ass, in the différent variants (however always of the sacred marriage type) of the myth of the animal destined in origin to transport the divinity, prior to the temple, еёбе vernee na samoe nebo (cf. also 509, and 528, n. 84). 39 Cf.

If untying Lazarus means «to make him go»,43 to tie the dead, even today in Carelia, means to prevent him from «Coming back», and to untie Koâôej, in the Russian fairly-tale, means to free the horse of the netherworld.44 In ail three cases we are in the conceptual range of a journey post mortem, which is exactly what we call here mi'räj. It must be remembered, then, that in Isaiah 9 : 1, it is the mount «of the air» (the cloud swept by the wind) by which the Lord journeys to Egypt, which is a «forerunner» of the Flight to Egypt ; the latter took place, as is well known, thanks to an ass which in a further Romanic représentation (at Autun) treads upon the clouds. In this range of ideas we may very well perçoive the simplification (and confusion) of terms occurring in a passage of the Babylonian Talmud}5 regarding a contradiction which in fact was nonexistent : «R. Alexandri said : R. Joshua b. Levi pointed out a contradiction. It is written, in its time [will the Messiah corne], whilst it is also written, 1 [the Lord] will hasten it — If they are worthy, I will hasten it : if not, [he will come] at the due time. R. Alexandri said : R. Joshua opposed two verses : it is written, And behold, one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven ; whilst [elsew here] it is written, [behold, thy hing cometh unto thee . . .] lowly, and riding upon an ass» — If they are meritorious, [he will come] with the clouds of heaven; if not, lowly and riding upon an ass». But the (equestrian) Iranian reinterpretation of the gentle «Semitic» donkey travelling in the skies seems also to imply a step further in colour sen sibility, perhaps through the intermediate passages of the well-known «cross» which marks the back of the ass, or of the black line running through the dazzling splendour of the coat of Firdusi's onager Akvân. The quoted passage proceeds thus : «King Shapur [I] said to Samuel, 'Ye maintain that the Messiah will come upon an ass : I will rather send him a white horse of mine.' He replied, 'Have you a hundred-hued steed?'». Here the barqâ of the original may be translated «white horse» only if specific biases on the matter are applied, on the basis of Biblical tradition (the donkey is white), or as residues of very ancient collective subconscious factors which require that of necessity the animal instrumental to a specific 42 Frejdenberg, op. cit., p. 500. 48 Frejdenberg, op. cit., p. 531, n. 122. 44 Cf.

SCARCIA function be white.4® Viceversa, it is the Semitic hiwwar, which corresponds in the text to the «hundred» of the English translation, which has been Persianized ab antiquo, while it might have well been interpreted as «white».47 In fact, the Rabbinical commentary by Rashi (Solomon ben Isaac, Troves 1040 —1105) explains48 that the füll question means : «Have you perchance a horse of a hundred hues? For thus is His ass». Here hywr would be équivalent to «one hundred» in Persian, through evident confusion with the graphically more plausible hazär «one thousand» of a différent interprétation49 — which is more or less the same thing in that context, where «many (colours)» is simplv meant. The latter interprétation rings thus in its entirety, albeit a bit obscurely : «Have you this horse, which has a thousand hues like the ass of the Messiah? For certainly he, too, will be up high by means of nature». Apart from what concerns the evident Iranization of the equid from white to «spotted» (ablag), we feel that behind this sort of expression a sensation of necessary relation between the idea of the ass and that of lévitation may be made out, although cloudily. But, in all this matter, what concerns us foremost today is the dichromy of the animal instrumental in the Iranian mi'râj : a dychromy essentially of the Zurvanite type, according to which the said animal is white and black, is day and night, is old and young, is the aged psychopomp and the impuber psycho pomp, corresponding in brief to the double aspect of the «genius of the wind» of Hellenistic-Roman culture, but also to the angels repeatedly analyzed by Cammann. And this «equestrian» dychromy in Iran involves, or, as hinted above, perhaps takes up, even the «prehistory of the equides» evoked from the height of the «knightly» mentality of the Firdusian dïhqân :50 a prehistory in which the mount of the day is, in this case also, a hemyone, a being which is créature of Vayu prior to becoming ràm, which is «savage as the wind» prior to 46 Cf.

But then, when eeeking (Bayet, Les Origines, pp. 463 — 467) instruments and companions of the earthly and netherworld Heracles, who «by logical connection» is a healer, should these instru ments and companions not be traced — rather than in the various euhemerizing «serpent guardians» which become «enemies» by «invertion of sign» (pp. 468 — 469), in the red dog Acta Orient.

But no doubt : that the wind is a manifestation of Verethragna/Bahräm is also stated in the Tasht XIV, and Firdusi says that the wind appears as an ablaq onager. Firdusi, who makes of it the instrument for an euhemerized and «overturned» apotheosis of the Него (Rustam = Gars hâsp), accompanied by an equally obvious «sacrifice» of the instrument itself51 — since the rite, and finally only the rite, is what effects the myth. In this light, the sacrifice of the ass of Carmania, witnessed by Strabo,52 cannot have been but an archaism, or a «local» épisode, in comparison with the «classical» Iranian sacrifice of the horse. A local event, however, in which the place is not causal, since the birthplace of the Firdusian wind-onager is precisely Oriental Iran. Let us read the story again, by sake of convenience in the abridged version by Levy,53 altered only by a few italics of ours. «ROSTAM AND AKVÄN THE DIVi (i) The Div appears It happened once, when an hour of the day had gone, that out the wild erness a herdsman arrived at the palace. He presented himself before the king, kissed the ground and said to that prince of blessed birth, 'Amongst my horses a wild ass has appeared like a démon escaped from its bonds. You would think it a maie Mon for savagery, for it can break the neck of any horse. In colour it exactly parallele the sun, as though the heavens had dipped it in liquid gold, and from its neck to its tail a stripe Ыаск as musk is drawn. From its rounded haunches, its fore-legs and hind-legs you could judge it to be a powerful bay charger.' Khosrow perceived that this was no wild ass, for no onager could surpass a horse in strength. Moreover he had seen much of the world and heard much from men of experience. He knew therefore that there existed a spring where Akvan the Démon dwelt, because of whom the world was overwhelmed by sorrow and lamentation. It was there that the herdsman kept his troop of horses, though letting them roam freely and safely for pasture. He said to the herdsman, sacrificed to Heracles against dryness, which ia so similar (if the connection with the Star Sirius is real) to the black horse of Yasht VIII ? Of the ashqar we have already spoken (above, n. 22) ; for some «équivalences» of red and black, cf. G. Vercellin, Zur e Arzur, in ACaF IX, 3 (1970), SO, I, (pp. 60—62), p. 56 sgg. 51 For the Iranian équivalence, by the way obvious, between sacrifice and winged (aerean) mount, see also I. Melikoff, Abu Muslim, le «portehache» du Khorasan, Paris 1962, p. 39. Even the conclusion of the episode in Firdusi (cf. below) represents the evi dent euhemerization of a sacrafice. 52 E.

To his escort he said, 'Noble man, all endowed with splendour and lofty rank, from amongst you warriors I need a champion of leonine daring who will devote himself to this endeavour.' As he spoke he looked keenly about him, but no warrior there met with his approval. For this high endeavour only Rostam son of Zâl was fitted to be of service. To him then he wrote a letter füll of kindliness and due gratitude and handed it to the warrior Gorgin son of Milâd, to whom the king of blessed fortune said, 'Bear this missive of mine to Zâl's son. Travel night and day as swift as smoke ; there must be no resting in Zâbolestân. Salute him warmly on my behalf, with the prayer that Heaven itself may not exist without him. When he has read the letter, tell him that my Farr owes everything to him. Show your face there but for a moment, then rise and return here. Once you have perused his reply do not linger in Zâbol.' Gorgin set off like a storm-wind, or lilce an onager in péril of its life. When he arrived in Zâbol, in the presence of the famous hero, he surrendered the king's letter to him, and he, on receipt of the royal command, departed at a gallop for the king's court. There he kissed the earth at the foot of the throne and prayed for the king's good fortune. Then he said, 'O king, you summoned me. Неге I stand to learn what you have thought out and wait with loins girt to hear what your behest shall be. May greatness and goodness be ever associated with your name.' The king answered, 'Elephant-body, a task has arisen for which I have chosen you out of ail my forces. If you do not deem it irksome, you must be ready at my bidding to strive for a throne and treasure. A herdsman has informed me that an onager has appeared amongst his troop of horses. And now, you must assume this fur ther undertaking and once again bürden yourself with a combat. Go, but be strongly on your guard, for this may be the Ahriman the vengeful.' Rostam commented, 'With fortune favourable to you, nobody who serves your throne сап harbour fear. Whether this be Div, lion or maie dragon, it will not escape my sharp sword.' (ii) Rostam seeks out the Div Out in pursuit of his prey went the male lion, lasso at hand with his dragon (i.e. Rakhsh) under him ; out into the wilderness travelled this fierce hon to where the herdsman kept his troop of horses. For three days he sought for it over the grazing-grounds ; on the fourth he saw it galloping over the piain Acta Orient. Eung.

It was a beast of shining gold, yet underneath its bide was a hidecnis canker.5i Rostam put spurs to his swift courser, but on coming close up with the beast he changed his purpose, saying, This créature must not be put to death. I must ensnare it in a loop of my lasso and not destroy it with my dagger. So I сап bring it to the king alive.' He thereupon cast his royal lasso with the purpose of entangling its head in the noose. But the powerful onager, espying the горе, suddenly vanished from bis sight,5S making him understand that this was no onager and that to deal with it demanded guile rather than strength. He thought, 'This сап be nothing but Akvân the Div must be dealt a sword-thrust swifter than wind. I have heard from a sage that this is its abode and that by some marvel it has assumed the hide of a onager, so I must employ the sword with cunning if I am to let blood pour over that yellow gold.' At that moment the onager reappeared from out of the wilderness, and the champion put spurs to his swift-moving steed. He fitted a string to his bow and made Raksh gallop faster than the wind, while he loosed an arrow that was quick as lightning. But no sooner had he drawn his royal bow than the onager vanished55 from his sight once again. Не galloped his courser over the wide piain in pursuit until, when a day and a night had thus passed, the need for water, and for bread too, overcame him, and his head struck the saddle-bow in sleep. Then, as his thirst for limpid water pressed urgently on him, there appeared in front of him a spring sweet as rose-water. He dismounted and watered Rakhsh, then out of weariness closed his eyes in sleep. From his royal saddle he unloosed his girth and laid down the saddle-cover of leopard-skin for a pillow, while Rakhsh moved off to graze. Then he spread out the felt underlay of the saddle alongside the water. (iii) Akvân the Div casts Rostam into the océan When from afar Akvân beheld Rostam asleep, he transformed himself into a storm-wind to gain approach. He dug round the earth ail dbout him and [on this bed of earth] raised him aloft from the plain to the skies,56 so that on Walking Rostam was smitten with fear.

Who will wreak vengeance on this accursed Div? There is none to confront him on equal footing/ As Rostam contorted himself in his distress, Akvân thus addressed him, 'Elephant-body, speak your wish and déclaré where you would desire the air to cast you downP Shall I thrust you down into the waters or on to the mountains? Into which région remote from men do you wish to fall?' Rostam heard the words and realized that he was in the clutches of the accursed Div.

'A Chinese sage has composed a discourse on this subject which déclarés that if a man yelds up his life in the océan his soul will not behold the angels in heaven but will remain in abasement where it lies ; he will find no entry into the next world. Do not therefore cast me into sea or make the fishes' belly ту grave.

Osmanov, II, Moskva 1963, pp. 151 — 154) is overthrown by the wind. The demonization clearly implies the identification of the jalïl wind with the «devil», (Mokri, op. cit., p. 66), but it also implies the identification of the jamil (räm) wind with the «tarnen of the devil, the latter being reduoed to «mount», or to «kidnapper». Only in the first case — and not even eonsistently — it becomes räm in its turn, whereas in the second case it is naturally stimulated to «unsaddle» its rider. From here dérivés the prevalence through Islam, with a seeming continuity, of the «fiery» image of the wind, from the Fäd-bearded figure, (cf. the proto Hermes), «running with its hair in the wind» (G. Widengren in Enciclopedia Universale dell'Arte Sansoni IV, p. 371) to the Akvän of Firdusi. On the other hand the «tamer» is, he too, often «fiery», since — apart from being «the angel of the goodly wind» — he is also tamer of the negative functions of the wind itself, riding on the latter for his positive aims. And the original concept of «sacrifice» remains in the final killing of the mount, effected by the «tamer» himself. In this sense, the pseudo-dynamism of the classical ico nography of St. George is nothing eise than a maximal synthesis : the true mount of the saint is not the horse, white as the ass of Christ, but the dragon, which in origin is an ablaq serpent like that of Asclepius : one may perceive this at Aghtamar, and in Cappa docia (e.g. in the Yilanh Kilise of Soganli).

As he spoke these words the malign Div seized the valiant Rostam and jlung him out of his hand into the depths of the océan. While falling oiit of the aether towards the sea, the hero quickly drew his keen sword from his girdle, so that the monsters which attacked him when he descended withdrew affrighted from his onslaught.58 He swam with his left arm and leg while with his other limbs he sought ways of fending off his attackers, ceasing not a moment from active motion, as is the way of men inured to war. Determining on a certain direction in the water, he at last reached dry land and caught sight of the plain. There he gave thanks to the Creator, who had delivered his girdle, he laid down his leopard-skin cloak by the side of a spring, cast aside his saturated bow and other weapons and clad himself once more in his coat of mail. From there he went to the spring where he had fallen asleep and the malevolent Div had snatched him up. Rakhsh, however, with his resplendent coat, was nowhere to be found on the pasture-ground, and the world-conqueror roundly imprecated his ill fate. With energy he roused himself, caught up saddle and bridle and despon dently followed the horse's footprints. At a walking расе he went forward, his eyes meanwhile searching for game, when suddenly a pasture-ground came into view. It was well wooded and watered by flowing streams and everywhere partridges and turtle-doves called. While the herdsman who held charge of Afrâsiyâb's horses had laid his head down in the woodland to sleep, the fiery Rakhsh had corne amongst the mares like a Div, neighing loudly in the midst of the herd. There Rostam caught sight of him and with a swing of his royal lasso entangled his head in the noose, then rubbed the dust from him, put on the saddle and grasped his sharp sword. That done, he began to drive off the whole herd, having pronounced the name of God over his sword. The tramp of the horses as it feil on the herdsman's ears roused him from his slumbers. He raised his head and shouted to his com panions, each of whom seized a bow and lasso. Mounted on their speedy coursera they rode out to discover who the evil misereant could be that was bold enough to enter that pasture-ground, where so many horsemen were on guard. Swiftly they rode off on their task of rending the skin of any such prowling lion. As Rostam espied the hasting men he quickly drew the sword of wrath from his girdle. Like a lion he roared and called out his name, saying, 'I am Rostam son of Dastân son of Sam/ With his sword he sew two men out of 58 Cf. DSvüd/Bäd «plongeur dans la mer» in Mokri, op. cit., p. 66, and even more Räm Tasht 27, where Garshâsp, as tamer of Vayu («by the help of Vayu») might be vic torious over Gandarv in the watere.

(iv) Afräsiyäb inspecte his herd of horses Each year Afräsiyäb had been accustomed to looking over his herd of horses, but he now found none in the places where he expected them to be. The herdsman told him how Rostam had single-handed driven off the herd and slain a number of the guards. This information stirred him to wrath and he went off in pursuit, only to be put to flight by Rostam, who returned to the spring. When Rostam once more in his gallop came back to the spring, his battle-thirsty heart was eager for still more. Once again Akvän the Div encoun tered him. 'Are you still not surfeited with combat?' he inquired. 'You escaped from the océan and the monsters' clutches, yet you have come to the field impatient for more strife. Now you are to see that day following which you will never seek a battle.' Tahamtan heard the demon's words and with the roar of a lion enraged he loosed his writhing lasso from his saddle-trap, cast it and encircled the other's waist in a knot. Turning in his saddle he raised his heavy axe as a blacksmith does his hammer and brought it down on the demon's head with the strength of a wild éléphant, crushing his head, brain and Shoulders into one mass. Then, dismounting, he drew his gleaming dagger and severed his head from his body. Now he called for blessing on the Creator, through whom he had beheld victory on the day of wrath. In this story you must recognize the démon as the man of evil, he that displays ingratitude towards God ; for you must reckon anyone who trans gresses the ways of humane conduct as a démon rather than a man. If your reason refuses to believe these taies, it may be that it has not accurately understood this inward significance.

As usual, in any case of danger, Bustam is sent for others eire of по avail against it since it сап change itself into the wind at pleasure. The tired sind baffled hero falls asleep, and Akwan — for it weis he who heid assumed the streuige shape — lifts up Bustam bodily into the eiir whence he drops the hero into the sea. The hero saves himself by swimming eind then deals with the demon when he comes upon the other unexpectedly. I now proceed to show the similarities of this Story to the Chinese legende about the god of the wind. (a) First, eis to the appeeirance and characteristics of Akwan : Fei Lien, the Chinese demon of the wind, is Said to have the body of the Steg, and is about the size of a leopard He is able to make the wind blow whenever he wishes it. It poeseeses also a serpent's teil. As regards colour he wears a yellow cloalc when he assumes the shape of an old mein, and it is yellow and white when it changes into a stick which exhales wind. [. . .] All these characteristics are carefully emphaeized by Firdausi in describing Akwan Dev. He speaks twice of the yellow or golden colour and the spots or lines in its body. هان لبكا حومحبميد دامحد دليت ٌجءممح بزداب كحبي بشت يكى بر كثيده حط ان يال امحى ز يك ب تا يبال اوى دلامحثددْ ذرين نكى بارْ بلا يحب اندرون رثت يتاره يؤد Nor does the Serpentine trait remain unnoticed. يرمن اعد از يرّئ عانتي عار كز و هر كى خوص دبمياو It is an interesting matter and well Worth noting that while in Chinese myths the winddemon has the body of a stag, in India Vayu (the wind-god) rides on the back of an antelope. Hence the «Gor» in the Shahnameh, the stag of the Chinese legende and the antelope of Indian mythology all symbolise the wind — very likely because по other animal сап represent better the speed and abrupt movements of the wind. (٥) In the second place, whenever Akwan Dev is hard pressed he changes into the wind. Further, it is ohvious that it was only a strong wind that could raise an «ele phantbodied hero» like Bustam and hurl him down from thence on land and sea. There could thus be по question of the identity of Akwan with the wind demon. But, as if to emphasize the identity further, in this Short episode of three or four pages Firdausi refers in one way or another to «the wind» repeatedly. (1) حمائم يديدثمى ّمإزإن يد لثمت حر ياي ثمار بر و ير كذثمت (2) حو ياي از حم حام لاسم يجن يعيانيئ لأستم هى يثن دست (3) حر اكؤإن دير اين نشايد يدن محايد بر باد محمى زدن Acta Offen،. Еипд.

(c) But, further, in this case Firdausi is aware fully that he is narrating a Chinese legend and he quotes from a Chinese philosopher the psychological traits of the demon beginning : جين ياي باّخ َتح داناى جبمى ذكى دلخاتى ز دن اندرمن At the end of the Story the poet goes further and informs US that the true name of the demon was not Akwan but Kwan ОГ Kuan and that it had been so written in Pehlevi; but since in Persian letters Compounds could not be formed at the beginning of words, it was necessary to write the name as Akwan : ّكوإن حؤان و اكؤان ديؤثى مخؤإه ابر بملمإد تكريان زين Now the name Kwan or Kuan thus emphasized by Firdausi reminds US of Chinese names of gods like KuanTi or Kuan Yu (thegod of war) and Kuan Yin (goddess of mercy). Akwan might also be a reminiscence of the Chinese expression «Kwei Wang» or «Kui Ong» which means the «Spectre King» (Cf. De Groot, Religious System of China, Vol. V, p. 806). While however, Akwan Dev is fully identified with the windgod, there are also old Chinese stories of «were stags» and «werebucks» which offer great resemblances to the Akwan episode. Thus «a were-buck most celebrated in China's history» created as much costernation by its appearance in the time of the renowned founder of the Wei dynasty as Akwan had caused at the Court of Kai-Khusrow. The warriors of the Wei Court were also at a loss how to seize the were-buck as the latter ran into a crowd of goats and assumed their shape through its magical powers. (De Groot, Vol. rv, p. 211.) Our Suggestion (that Akwan represents the wind-demon) is corroborated when we find that Rustam is not the only Saka hero to whom the feat of Overcoming the wind demon is attributed. Indeed, there was something like a tradition in Rustam's family of fighting the stormgod or wind-spirit. For in Denkart (Book IX, chapter 15, section 2) we read of Rustam's great ancestor Kereshasp that «the mighty wind was appeased by him and brought back from damaging the World to benefiting the creatures.» Nor is the exploit confined to the Saka heroes, for a purely Iranian hero, Kai Khusro, is Said to have transformed the wind into the shape of a camel and to have ridden him. «So, for Rustam as subduing the wind in the shape of Akwan Dev we are following the precedents and ideas of the legende both of Sakastan and of Iran.» On the mythical basic structure we are in full agreement, while merely believing that the Sinologieal reasons brought forth may be superfluous ; also because, among other things, what is meant by Gin and cini in the Iranian World is known of long,80 and because the «Pahlavic» form of Akvan is — as the 0؛Thanks especially to the research of A. s.

For the name of the demon-wind-onager it is possible to provide explanations of a purely local character, perhaps even more local than was believed by Spie gel61 or Noldeke.62 For this, it is sufficient to think of the area which, in Iran, présents itself as the ideal birthplacc of the hemyone. Of course, even in the Iranian zone, as in the Fertile Crescent, one may pose the paleontological and historical problem of clarifying which was the exact species of equides to be considered legitimate predecessor of the horse in a «coadjuvating» position. In fact, we know that the presumed onager of the Standard of Ur does not appear to be such any longer ;63 and also for Carmania we might suggest — as a contrast with our Akvân — some being corresponding to the Equus asinus Palestinae on which debate is concerned at présent, following a report by Ducos.64 However, an ancient stereotype would bring about a distance between the «Hamito-Semitic» ass, which feared the cold, and Scythia,65 Pontus,66 and the Indoeuropean area in général,67 despite the tradition, taken up in the tenth Pythiac by Pindarus, of the Hyperborean sacrifice of the ass :68 the latter might, 81 Fr.

SCAKCIA of course Ъе a rite made precious by the rarity of the animal, but it implies at ail events a close participation of the beast itself to the social and religious life of the relevant Community. In any case, if the same doubts are allowed for the hemyone of Carmania and of Ur, it does not seem possible to be in any great perplexity concerning the Sistan onager, zâbulï we might say, i.e. of Garshäsp and Rustam, i.e. of Vayu and Zurvän/Zäl. Quoting from very recent research :69 «Equides are represented [at Shahr-i sükhta, III mill. В. C.] by the wild ass or hemyone. Since Sistan is part of the original milieu of the onager (ghor-khar) the archaeological remains are referred to this subspecies ... It may be held that the flesh of the hemyone was used for eating. It is very likely that the hemyones rarely constituted the objecte of hunting . . . the fiery nature of the present-day onagers has been an impassable obstacle toward their domestication . . . The onager, as in général the wild Asiatic asses, is originally a typical dweller of the predesertic steppes, being an animal much tied to water, unlike the African wild ass . . . Sistan in the âge of Shahr-i sükhta must have represented an ideal habitat for the life of the hemyone, due to the vast terraced areas covered by underbush, as well as for the salt-laden végétation, and for the presence of the Hamun-i Hilmand basin. Moreover, its disappearance . . . goes back to a very recent âge. In 1902 [the animal] was still so abundant as to be the object of regulär hunt on the margins of the Registan desert. . .». As for the problem of the presence of the ass at Shahr-i sükhta, «a positive answer would be of great interest, since it would constitute the most ancient indication of the ass in Sistan. Hitherto, the earliest positive testimony ... is . . at Dhan-i Ghula man ... in the VI—IV centuries B. C. From the same city come also a few bones of hemyone and horse. Since the horse has not been found at Shahr-i Sokhta, if the indication of the ass could find confirmation, the latter would have been introduced into Sistan 1200 years before the horse : in the opposite case . . . more or less at the same time». The most plausible localization of primitive Zâbul has already been indicated for some time,70 an the local legends which place the glades of Samangän, in themselves negligible, in the adjacent zone of Rashkhwâr (Ak barâbâd, the Parthian Qal'a-yi Jïj), confirm further a constant tradition in Turkmenian folklore : i.e. that Canbul &gt; Canlibel is to be found in the «four mountain» région close to Herat, which can hardly be other than the area of Adraskan-Sabzavâr in Afghanistan, rigidly divided into four parts, where still 19 L.

The exact significance of the name cannot be ascertained. As it is now pronounced, the word differs from the form in vogue at the présent day ; in Sistan is Auk and the inhabitants are called Aukatis ; this is very much closer to the ancient form of the name than the first».72 In any case, and however it may be read and interpreted, the form Awq corresponds to a place renowned for its great antiquity, seat of a peculiar cuit which is that of the Jabal al-Fath, or Möns Victorialis of the Kings of Bethle hem, or Küh-i Zür/Zor/Zäl/Zurvän ; and the Afghans, who according to a surely not vain legend come from a Kuh-i Firûza («victorious» or «turquoise»),73 sharing here a religiously «Jewish» phase with the «Zurvanite» family of Rus tam,74 dérivé their very peculiar name from none other but that toponym, «normalized» in a populär and picturesque fashion (as is suggested by G. Yercellin in the form of a too modest hypothesis).75 In fact, they have been known in Iran and Europe as Awkans and Akwans long before than as Afghans ; and the language of the Turkmenians — important bearers, as said, of specific linguistic relies — does not even at présent make use of the modem term. The country under discussion is still called, according to them, Awqân, and a camouflaged reflex of this is also maintained, probably, in the populär Khorasa nic use of saying Afghän for Afghanestän and Afghani. Thus, if the immédiate descendants of the Avagäna of the VI Century Indian sources have inherited the «victorial» culture of Awq, which is the same as saying the culture of Zâbul and of Zâl/Zurvân, or of the country of Garshâsp and Yayu, there can be nothing peculiar in the fact that a «démon» of theirs, which is Vayu and the victorious Verethragna76, and the local onager by spontaneous association of ideas, should have a name meaning, more or less, nothing eise than Zâbulï. Täte provides information on the specific «corruptibility» of the name : but 71 Cf. also, by G. Vercellin, Sindand. Le vicende di un toponimo afgano, in ACaF, XIII, 3 (1974), SO. 5, pp. 99—107.

SCARCIA Akvän is a facilior variant from the phonetical viewpoint (cf. also Kruzinski)77 than a prototype which we too would seek in the vicinity of Äbalc, Äßag, Pashtu oba. At this point, it is only required to think of how the pair Verethragna onager is recomposed in the name itself, very well-known as it is, of Bahrâm Gur : the primitive naturistic wind-onager gives way to a mythological person ified wind plus an onager, and then, in the fable, to a hero who hunts onagers. It will be thus clear that Pre-Islamic Near Eastern antiquity had very précisé symbological figurative realizations of the wind, both as an instrument of victory (Yerethragna) and as an instrument of mi'räj (the miraculous mount of the Akvän type). Can new light thus be acquired by the tradition — otherwise certainly difficult to be understood — according to which Bahräm Gur proper would have been the restorer of the ancient lost Dyonisiac spirit at the court of justice of the Persian kings ?78 Be that as it may : if Bahräm Gur, i.e. the onager Yerethragna, is also Vahagn, as Orbeli states with strong arguments and not incorrectly,79 here is a further plausible explanation of the «double» Zurvanite traits, of the Zäl-i zar type, of the Armenian hero identified with Herakles :80 and this time we will be on the level of myth itself, not on that of intellectual analogies. But the search in the iconographical field is certainly not less stimulating than the one we have here begun among the papers of the Médiéval poets. On this line it must be said, and recalled in concluding, that — apart from the ascensional iconography of the Jamshid-Ka'üs-Alexander type, and apart from the innumerable Burâq &gt; onagers which are everywhere found in the act of accompanying the Prophet of Islam to heaven — the evidence of a journey up high effected by the aid of winged anthropomorphical genii, angel turned winds so to speak, seems to us to be prépondérant in the Iranian milieu. For this theme, cf. especially certain miniatures of the XIV Century described 77 Tarih-i Seyyah, hoc est chronicon peregrinantie вей Historia ultimi belli Persarum cum Aghwanis gestis, e tempore primae eorum in Regnum Persicum ejusque occupationis, usque ad Eschrefum Aghwanum . . .
