<plain_text><page sequence="1">Transactions of the American Philological Association 133 (2003) 17-49 Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic DEREK COLLINS University of Michigan summary: This paper explores the concepts of nature, cause, and agency as they define Greek magical practice in the Classical period. I seek first to demonstrate that the authors of the Hippocratic and Platonic attacks on magic share basic assumptions about nature and divinity with the magical practitioners them selves. Next, I situate magic within the mechanical, teleological, and volitional modes of Greek causal explanation, demonstrating how these modes can over lap in the explanation of a magical event. Finally, I consider figurines as a test case for concepts of causality in magical action. I argue that figurines, like Greek statues generally, are viewed as social agents capable of causing events to happen in their vicinity. Once we situate the figurines within a network of so cial relations, new explanations can be derived for the practice of binding and abusing them. i. introduction: the problem of magic IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN EASIER TO DEFINE ANCIENT MAGIC by Contrasts than in its essence.1 Without a context for magical practices?whether curses, ritu als, prayers, the fashioning of figurines or dolls, or the use of pharmaceuti cals?we cannot give a full account of what Greeks of the Classical period un derstood as magic. And even when a context exists for these activities and we appear to be in a better position to analyze magical behavior, serious category confusion persists. Public, state-sponsored curses, for example, seem to defy 1 The bibliography here is large, but I have found the following works especially help ful in outlining current approaches: Dickie 12-46, Bremmer, Gordon 1999, Graf 1997: 20-60 and 1995, Segal 1995 and 1981, Phillips 1994 and 1986:2727-32, Versnel 1991, Aune, Nock, Hopfner. Hoffman and Smith 2002 and 1995 (with his focus on ritual) offer useful critiques of earlier scholarly approaches but are not themselves especially fruitful.</page><page sequence="2">18 Derek Collins a simple "public/private" or "social/antisocial" contrast for magic.2 Similarly, formularies that employ for their efficacy propitiation, slander, and compul sion of divine3 forces blur perhaps the most conventional and misleading contrast, that between religion as propitiatory and magic as coercive in their respective attitudes toward divinity.4 And (papuxxKa?here substances in tended for erotic or healing purposes?fall within the purview of Athenian law if, but only if, the victim was injured or died (in which case a charge of murder could be raised). In legal terms, the notoriously ambivalent charac ter of (papjiocKce is only clarified in the aftermath of damage.5 Part of the reason magic has yet to be dissolved as a concept?in the same way that the concepts of kinship and gift-exchange, for example, have been dissolved by anthropologists?and reformulated in terms of social, institu tional, symbolic, or other categories,6 is that there is a fundamental concep tual division between scholars who see the basis of magic as objective and material and those who see it as subjective and psychological;7 there is no unified concept to dissolve. Moreover, there is a further dichotomy between those who see thought and those who see action as the primary distinction in magic, a dichotomy that is also evident in scholarship on magic in other cultures and periods.8 But the distinction between thought and action is arti ficial because the two are not easily separable, since action occurs in a con text of culturally specific concepts of cause and agency. "Action" is defined by 2 E.g., SEG 9.3 = Meiggs and Lewis 5-9, no. 5, esp. lines 40-51, which involves curses and wax effigies made by the founders of Libyan Cyrene (late 7th century b.c.e.) on be half of the community. See further Martinez 345-47 and Faraone 1993. At Teos (Meiggs and Lewis 62-66, no. 30), the so-called Dirae Teorum (c. 470 b.c.e.), which were to be recited publicly (B 29-34), specifically prohibited among other things the creation of harmful drugs (A 1-5); see Graf 1997: 35. Fowler 331,341,343, oddly argues that magic involves socially disapproved, while religion involves socially approved, behavior, which he then undercuts in his discussion (325-30,340) of overlooked magical elements in public rituals (e.g., the Panathenaia, the Arrhephoria, and the Arkteia for Artemis at Brauron). 3 Throughout this paper I use the term "divine" to refer generally to expressions such as 0?o?, ?aiuxov, to Ge?ov, and so forth, because I am interested in the more general fea tures of their agency. Differences between them, however, do obtain: see Tabornino and esp. Fran?ois. 4 For such formularies see, e.g., PGMIV.2471-92, XXXVI. 138-44. 5 See now Collins 2001. Examples include Antiphon 1, Against the Stepmother, also discussed recently by Faraone 1999: 114-16. 6 Bourdieu is an exception. 7 Plato already drew this distinction at Lg. 11.932e-933c, on which see Graf and Johnston 1999: 667 and the discussion below. 8 See Smith 2002: 89 on this distinction and its consequences for scholarship.</page><page sequence="3">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 19 what a given culture regards as an "agent"?that is, by the sorts of things that are deemed capable of producing effects in the world. Similarly, causal expla nation is not universal: what is an incidental cause for one culture might be an efficient one in another. Until we can describe these concepts for the Greeks, we run the risk of applying contemporary and inappropriate conceptions of agency and cause in our analyses of magic. The same caution applies to the moral universe in which magic is sometimes seen to operate, i.e., the world in which magic is invoked by observers as an explanation for disaster or as a hedge against failure.9 Until the contours of such moral universes are mapped, however, it is unsafe to assume that magic explains anything. Because there is little agreement on whether magic is to be defined in terms of what individu als do, as opposed to what they or others think about what they do, or whether it should be some combination of these, scholars work at cross-purposes.10 And despite the flurry of recent publications on ancient magic, there is not even fundamental agreement on what the data are.11 Recent attempts at definition have begun reasonably enough by outlining and drawing distinctions among the central concepts of (papjuocKeioc, yonxeia, (layeia, and so forth, along with their antecedents.12 Nevertheless, the results of this exclusively philological approach have been at best mixed. This is be cause, while scholars have shown that these concepts emerged out of a clash of perspectives between ?lite intellectuals (especially the Hippocratics and Plato) and the practitioners of magic whom they attacked in the late 5th and 4th centuries b.c.e.,13 already by the 4th century the concepts themselves were 9 Cf. Segal 1995:282. The classic argument for this position is of course Evans-Pritchard. 10 Perception is not in itself always a reliable guide to defining magic either, since individual practitioners of magic may perceive what is "magical" about their activities very differently, and attitudes within one individual may change over time; see Lewis. (This is a separate issue from the larger problem of labeling behavior as magical by variously-invested groups; see Phillips 1991.) In this presentation I approach Greek magic from two perspectives. In the sec ond section, which treats the Presocratics, Hippocratics, and Plato, I use the term "magic" to refer to what these observers define as magic, which could be taken to mean that here the concept is negatively defined. But my fundamental claim is that one of their theoreti cal dilemmas?to account for the divine influence in nature?was the loophole exploited by magical practitioners, who readily accepted such influence. There is no contradiction, then, between my use of the term "magic" in this and the third and fourth sections, which address the issues of causality and agency from the point of view of magical practice. 11 Hence Gager (12) would like, not unreasonably, to eliminate all attempts to define magic. See further Ogden 85-86, with bibliography. 12 Most recently Dickie 12-46. Other approaches will be discussed below. 13 See Collins 2001: 482-85 and Dickie 20-21, who follows Graf 1997: 20-35.</page><page sequence="4">20 Derek Collins generalized to the point of interchangeability.14 Their explanatory value is therefore limited. Moreover, none of these terms sufficiently illuminates the conceptual processes underlying the concrete practices involved in Greek magic. Thus for Plato to call magic "cpapuocKE?a" or "uocyyaveia" in the same breath, interesting as that is, does not explain why lead defixiones and figu rines in lead, clay, and wax, as opposed to other objects or other materials, were employed in magic. To understand Greek magic we must look in my view not only at the Greek terms that refer to fields of activity, but also at the con ceptions of causality and agency implied by the magical practices and objects themselves. To frame the issue in another way, the question that needs to be asked is not "What is Greek magic?" but "When is Greek magic?"15 When does a magi cal item such as a bound wax figurine or an incantation actually become magical? Does it "become" magical at all? These are more complex questions than they might at first seem, and I shall offer three different points of entry in trying to answer them. In section 2 I address the issue of how divine influence was intrinsic to "nature" (cpuai?), a concept that preoccupied the Presocratics and was inher ited from them by the Hippocratic physicians and Plato.16 This conception of nature prevented both the Hippocratics and Plato, despite their attempts at criticism, from claiming that magic was not efficacious?even if they could claim that it was illogical or immoral?because such a claim would have been belied by the effects that they knew nature was capable of producing. In section 3 I examine the mechanical, teleological, and volitional causes that allowed certain events to be perceived as magical. The issue of causality emerges clearly in the Hippocratic and Platonic attacks on magic. But by set ting these critiques in the broader context of causal speculation in the 5th and 4th centuries, I argue that the difficulty of reconciling divine causation with more predictable causal factors left the Greeks with a conceptual framework 14 E.g., at PL Lg. 932e-933b; see Dickie 44-45. 15 This question was asked of Western art almost thirty years ago (see Goodman), but it is only recently that attempts have been made to answer it in terms that are now revo lutionizing the very notion of "art" (see esp. Gell 1988,1992, and most importantly, 1998; but see also the important critique of Gell by Weiner, esp. 38). I mention this because such studies have influenced my own approach to Greek magic, and my own view (which I cannot argue here) that many of its practices lie closer conceptually to artistic and tech nological production than has been recognized. 16 The literature on (puoi? is large, especially in the context of its relationship to v?uoc, which is beyond the scope of the present inquiry. I cite here only Beardslee and Heinimann as useful background.</page><page sequence="5">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 21 in which magic remained possible. That is, if an event could be ascribed to both visible and invisible causes, magic could not be eliminated as a cause. Finally, as test case for concepts of magical causation, in section 41 discuss figurines.171 examine how figurines were perceived to embody social agency and to be situated within a network of social relations. I argue that the agency imputed to figurines?by which I mean their human-like ability intention ally to cause events to happen?must be understood within the wider con text of attitudes toward "statuary" in Greece (and beyond), from children's dolls to images of divinities sanctioned by civic cult. From an anthropologi cal point of view, it would be artificial not to locate all of these images on a single conceptual continuum.18 2.1 Nature and Divinity Although one concern of metaphysical speculation from the Presocratics to the Peripatetics was to restrict the imputation of conscious intention to na ture, especially with regard to meteorological phenomena, the lingering ac ceptance of the possibility of divine intervention made it impossible for crit ics to deny the possibility of magic.19 The major critics of magic in the 5th and 4th centuries, the Hippocratic authors and Plato, never do deny its pos sibility, but rather focus their energies on undermining the logical and moral premises upon which magical practitioners supposedly worked.20 This is not just a rhetorical strategy, but follows directly from the premise that nature and magic could produce indistinguishable effects in the world. Indeed, as Aelian would say many centuries later, (pUGi? is a ?apuxxid?.21 Such an explicit equation was not, as far as we know, made in the Classical period, yet the foun dation for it was already laid in the long-standing Presocratic tradition of 17 In the context of the present inquiry I have chosen to examine only figurines. In future work I intend to explore the causal relations of other forms of Greek magic such as incantations, (papuaKOt, and purifications. 18 The anthropological point of view being, to my mind, inherently necessary for ex plaining the nature and function of these objects. 19 Meteorological phenomena such as thunder, lightning, comets, solar and lunar eclipses, are standard topics in the attempts to curtail the scope of divine influence in nature: some examples include Anaxagoras 59 A 81 D-K, Democritus 68 A 75 D-K, Critias 88 B 25.29-32 D-K, and Theophrastus at Meteorology 14.14-29 (Daiber); see Mansfeld 1992: 317-24. As Lloyd (1987: 49 n. 163) notes, the effect of such arguments over time was to offer alternative frameworks for understanding nature, but it is not at all clear that this was their intention. 20 por plato this point is noted by Saunders 99. 21 NA 2.14.

This section will consider some of the implica tions of this state of affairs for understanding magic as it emerges in the in tellectual critiques of the 5th and 4th centuries. It will be important to note that what these critiques seem to reject is the "popular" anthropomorphic view of divinity, except that in this regard they are not entirely successful. This leaves their own position paradoxically vulnerable to the very critique by which they sought to attack popular practices. Let us begin with a brief overview of the Presocratic tradition that attrib uted divinity to nature.22 Tha?es of Miletus, for example, is reputed to have thought that everything was full of divinities (?ocijaove?), which means that his first principle, water, would also be divine ( 11 A 1 Diels-Kranz [hence forth D-K] = Arist. de An. 1.41 la8; 11 A 3 D-K).23 This same idea is found in Heraclitus who, although grounding the emergence of things in fire, never theless felt that everything?i.e., the elemental powers constitutive of every thing?was full of 8oci|nov?? as well (22 A 1 D-K = D. L. 9.7).24 According to Aristotle, Anaximander thought to obteipov to be "divinity" (to 0e?ov; 12 A 15 D-K = Arist. Ph. 3.4.203M4). Anaximenes, again as reported by later sources, thought air to be divine (A?t. 1.7.13; Cic. N. D. 1.10.26 = 13 A 10 D K), a doctrine that can be related to the idea, attributed to him, that all things present, past, and future, as well as gods (Geoi) and divinity (Ge?oc), emerge from air (13 A 7 D-K = Hippol. Haer. 1.7). Such conceptions of divinity were as a rule extended to the arrangement of nature?koguo??and then to the totality of the world.25 Hence Tha?es could saythatK?^iGTOVK?ajioc-Tco?rnxa y?p 9eo?&gt; (11A1 D-K = D.L. 1.35), adding that the vo?&gt;? to?&gt; k?guot&gt; was also ? 0?0? ( 11A 23 D-K = A?t. 1.7.11). For Anaxagoras, of course, the vo?&gt;? itself was not only a god (0?o?), but was furthermore Koauorcoi?c (59 A 48 D-K = A?t. 1.7.15). Xenophanes is worth mentioning in this regard, not least because his famous attack against the depiction of the gods in Homer and Hesiod (21 B 11 and 12 D-K) was lev eled on moral, but certainly not ontological, grounds. For one of his main concerns was to show that the one god (ei? 0?0?) that existed was altogether unlike mortals (21 B 23 D-K, with 21 B 14, 15, and 16 D-K), which shows that his real problem was with the poets' anthropomorphism. According to Aristotle, when Xenophanes looked upon the heavens and expressed himself 22 General background to issues of doxography in Mansfeld 1999. 23 Cf. A?t. 1.7.11 = 11A 23 D-K and see Kirk et al. 96-97.

Hist. 7 ??oypoVci?E ... ?v dvoci to 7tav, Kai tov 0?ov Gupxp-ufj to?? k?cgiv). Along somewhat different lines Parmenides, borrowing from Hesiod (Th. 120), postulated a ?aiuxov, r?v?Gi?, as the controlling principle of generation (28 B 12 D-K) and something that deemed ?'pco? first of all the gods (28 B 13 D K).27But all of this for Parmenides, nevertheless, presupposed a unitary uni verse (28 B 8.5-6 D-K) in which generation could occur despite the limita tions of the senses and of human ability to perceive it. Zeno and Melissus like wise declared that to ev kcci nav was 0?ov (29 A 30 D-K = A?t. 1.7.27). It was not only at the level of the whole that divinity was intrinsic to na ture for the Presocratics, but also at the level of the elements of which the whole was composed. Astronomical phenomena were particularly susceptible of characterization as divine. So Aristotle tells us that Alcmaeon, like Tha?es, Heraclitus, and Diogenes of Apollonia, includes them in the category of the divine: "all divine things also always move continuously: the moon, sun, stars, and the whole heaven" (24 A 12 D-K = Arist. de An. 1.405a32-33 kiv??g0ou y?p ... toc 0?ia n?vxa guv?%c?? ?x?, G??t|vr|v, fj?aov, tou? dcGT?pa? Kai tov o?pavov ?Xov).28The comic poet Epicharmus claimed that the winds, water, earth, sun, fire, and stars were gods (199 Kassel-Austin = Stobaeus 4.31a.30).29 Parmenides, too, thought that his primary elements, fire and earth, were gods (28 A 33 D-K = Clem. Al. Protr. 5.64). And Empedocles figures significantly here, maintaining as he did that his four elements or roots?fire, earth, air, and water?were also gods (31 A 32 D-K = A?t. 1.7.28). He even identified these individual elements with specific gods (namely, Zeus, Hera, Hades, and Nestis: 31 B 6 D-K), although the ancient attributions (e.g., 31A 33 D-K) are questionable.30 Such, then, are some of the complex attributions of divinity to nature made by the Presocratics. These views have direct implications for later critiques of magic. 26 In contradistinction to the plurality of gods in the poets, so Ross ad 1.5.986b24. 27 Ca?ame 237-43, esp. 239. 28 All translations in this paper are by the author. 29 Cf. this same view among later Pythagoreans as reported by D. L. 8.27 = 58 B la D-K. 30 Kingsley 47-48.</page><page sequence="8">24 Derek Collins 2.2 Nature and Magic The most significant attack on magic that we know of from the late 5th and early 4th centuries occurs in the Hippocratic treatise On the Sacred Disease (especially at 1.28-30 Grensemann).31 The polemical nature of the author's attack on jmxyoi, Ka0apTa?, ay?pTai, and ?tax?ov?? has been well empha sized by scholars and need not be repeated here.32 Since we have just exam ined how several Presocratics imputed divinity to meteorological phenom ena, I begin by comparing those positions to the following statement (Morb. Sacr. 18.1-2 Grensemann): ai)Tr| ?? r\ vo?go? r\ ipfi Kataouivn arc? tcov avx&amp;v rcpocpaG?cov y?veTai Kai ai doutai, arc? tcov TtpoGi?vTcov Kai arci?vTcov Kai \j/u%?o?

This so-called "sacred" disease comes from the same causes as others, from what comes to and goes from us, from the cold, the sun, and the changing and never ceasing winds. For these things are divine ... The significance of this statement, although it does not reflect the views of all Hippocratic treatises, should not be underestimated. For example, it has been observed about this passage that the author makes no detailed attempt to support his claim that the elements are divine, which suggests that such a belief is taken for granted and does not need defense.33 The implication is that the causal agents of disease, the elements, while they may have their own proper ties and effects?i.e., their own (pUGi?,34 which can be manipulated?never theless retain their connection with a more abstract conception of divinity. Accordingly, if the sacred disease comes to us from the same divine, elemental causes as all other diseases, then our author can deny his adversaries' claim that this disease is more divine than others. He continues (Morb. Sacr. 18.2 Grensemann): TauTa 5' ?gti Oria cogt? \ir\ ?riv arcoKpivovTa to v?Grjua 0?i?T?pov tcov Xoik&amp;v vo(ii??iv, ?XX? n?vxa Oria Kai rc?vTa ?vOpcomva, cpuGiv ?? emGTOv ?%?i Kai o?vajLiw ?(p' ?(o\)TO?), Kai ou??V obiop?v ?GTiv o??' ?urixavov. 31 Except where noted, for convenience all other Hippocratic texts are cited from the Loeb edition. 32 See Collins 2001: 483-85. 33 Edelstein 210. 34 A detailed study of qr?Gic in the Hippocratic corpus, with bibliography, can be found in P?rez 419-36.</page><page sequence="9">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 25 For these things are divine, so that it is not necessary for one distinguishing to consider the disease more divine than the others, but all are divine and all are human. Each has a nature and force of its own, and none is unmanageable and without remedy. Diseases have both divine and human aspects. They are divine in that the divine elements are ultimately responsible for their occurrence, and they are human inasmuch as each disease has its own nature and course, which can be manipulated by the physician.35 There are many statements to this effect scattered throughout the Hippocratic texts.36 At the end of the section from which the above passages are taken, which concludes On the Sacred Disease, the author argues that what cures the disease is not purifications (Ka0appoi ) and magic (uxxyin), but the physicians knowledge of how to create moisture or dryness, heat or cold to correspond allopathically with the disease, which had been created by the opposing element. One of the author's arguments against the u?yoi, Ka0apTa?, ay?pTai, and ??,a?ov?? who offer their services in the treatment of epilepsy is that they claim a purely divine origin for the disease, even to the point of identifying certain symptoms with certain divinities (1.33-38), which makes their rem edy of purification an illogical response. Purification assumes a prior defile ment (u?aGuoc), blood guilt (dctaxGTO pi a), bewitchment (7i?(papuxxK??&gt;G0ai), or some other unholy deed (?pyov ?v?Giov)?none of which is relevant to epilepsy?and in any event, our author maintains, victims are neither taken to the temples of the gods thought responsible, nor are the offscourings from purification dedicated to those gods (1.39-43). Though critical of the practi tioners of magic, however, our author rejects neither purification nor anthro pomorphism (Morb. Sacr. 1.45-46 Grensemann): to: youv uiyurua t?v ajaapTnjiaTGW Kai ?voGiarcaTa to Oe??v egti to KaOa?pov Kai ?yvi?ov Kai p?uua yiv?u?Vov ?|u?v, a?To? te opou? to?gi 0?O?Gi tcov i?pcov Kai tcov T?U?V?cov ?7ioO??KV?|i?v, cb? ?v urj?ri?

We ourselves mark the boundaries of the sanc tuaries and sacred precincts of the gods so that no one will traverse them un less he is pure; when we enter we besprinkle ourselves, not as defiling ourselves, but to wash away any defilement that we have previously acquired.37 Purification is clearly appropriate to specific, anthropomorphic deities, and has a place in civic cult.38 At bottom, then, this critique turns out not to be an attack on the efficacy of magic, but on its practice outside the boundaries of civic cult. It is not even clear that there is anything distinctive about magical practice that can be refuted, because to do so would be to deny the validity of those same practices when they take place in the context of civic worship. Exactly what magic means to the Hippocratic authors becomes still harder to define if we examine the range of practices that they considered accept able in the course of treatment. As one example, dream interpretation is con sidered a necessary skill for a physician because dreams that are divine (as opposed to those that are not) indicate bodily disorders ( Viet. 4.87).39 For some disorders prayer is recommended: when the signs are good, prayer to Helios, Zeus Ouranios, Zeus Kt?sios, Athena Kt?si?, Hermes, and Apollo is required; if the signs are bad, prayer to the "averters of evil" ((X7ioTp?7taioi), to G?, and to the Heroes is recommended instead ( Viet. 4.89). Divine agents clearly have a role to play in the treatment of disease, and constitute one component of a more extensive regimen.40 For at least some of the Hippocratics, then, there was no radical discontinuity between mechanical and divine causes of bodily ailments. Nature incorporates divine forces, and even if some physicians tried to understand the mechanical processes of disease, it is mistaken to claim that what separates "magical medicine" (Zaubermedizin) from the Hippocratic approach is the former's belief in personal divine influence.41 37 Cf. the critique of Heraclitus (22 B 5 D-K) that purification through bloodshed is a contradiction "as if one who stepped in dirt washed himself off with dirt." 38 Cf. Jouanna 192-93. 39 Discussion of this position, including Aristotle's support of some of the same pre mises, in Lloyd 1987: 30-37. 40 Cf. Viet. 4.87 "Prayer is good, but it is also necessary for a man calling on the gods to help out." 41 Thus Furley 82 n. 9, "Doch scheinen mir die Erkl?rungsmodelle der Zaubermedizin einerseits und des Hippokratikers andererseits in De morbo sacro grunds?tzlich verschieden. Der Zaubermediziner glaubt an ein pers?nliches Eingreifen ?bergeordneter g?ttlicher M?chte, w?hrend der Hippokratiker wenigstens versucht, ein wissenschaftliches System aufzustellen, das auf g?ttliches Eingreifen verzichtet." Cf. Graf 1997: 32. Except for the association of magic with the irrational, I still find Lloyd's (1979: 49) position tenable: "No straightforward account, in which 'science' and 'philosophy' together and in</page><page sequence="11">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 27 Plato was similarly adamant about the role divinity played in nature. In the context of the Athenian stranger's arguments in the Laws for the exist ence of divinity, the atomists Leucippus and Democritus are singled out (though unnamed) for attack because they denied any role for the gods (10.889a-c). Nor did these thinkers allow a role for reason (vo??) in exist ence, the Anaxagoran view, because they held qnjGi?, Tt)%r|, and T8xvr| alone to be sufficient. But for Plato, as for the Hippocratics and the preponderance of the Presocratic tradition, qnjGi? incorporates the gods (10.889e, 890d).42 And as in the Hippocratic treatise just discussed, so for Plato (pvGi? also provides the mechanical basis of magic. In his view, one type of magic "cre ates harm by means of matter against matter according to nature" (Lg. 11.933al Gcbuxxai GC?jiaTa KaKonpyo?Ga ?GTi KaTOC (p?Giv), while his sec ond type, including 87i(poai and icaTa?eGei?, operates through persuasion (Lg. 11.933a2-b5, where note 7iei0eiv and ?oyjua). Plato's analogy is similar to what Gorgias describes in the Helen, where the power of the word acts on the arrangement of the soul, just as the arrangement of (pdppaica acts on the nature of bodies (82 B 11.14 D-K tov auT?v ?? taSyov ?%ei r\ te to?&gt; ?oyon ?UvajLU? 7lpO?

Apparently the magical practitioners and victims whom he criticizes did not bother with his typological distinction, nor should too much weight be given to it in the Laws. Elsewhere, in fact, Plato mentions the use of his second type of magic (ejicpoai) as if its efficacy were assumed; he offers no psychological interpretation or rebuttal to the exaggerated claims of its practitioners, as he does in the Laws, nor to its basis in nature.44 Nevertheless, that nature does lie at the bottom of at least one type of magic, however con stituted, and that nature incorporates divinity, seems beyond dispute for Plato. unison stand opposed to 'magic' and the 'irrational,' can be sustained in the face of the evident complexities both within and between the theory and practice of medicine on the one hand and those of the investigation concerning nature on the other" (italics in original). 42 Mannsperger 56-58, who also discusses the important passage at Sph. 265c.

Thus I disagree with Graf 2002:98 when he sug gests that Plato's theory is merely psychological and that magic would cease to exist if the effects ascribed to it were properly explained.</page><page sequence="12">28 Derek Collins The view that magic is intrinsic to nature can also be found outside of the Hippocratic authors and Plato, of course. In literature and myth, for example, the common trope of divinities giving magical aids to mortals, such as Hermes to Odysseus (Od. 10.302-6), Aphrodite to Jason (Pi. P. 4.217-19), and so forth, seems to acknowledge that magic has both a natural and a divine origin. Simi lar traditions about figures such as the Telchines and Idean Dactyls provid ing mortals with knowledge of metalworking, statuary, and amulets fit the same pattern.45 Nor is it just archaic myth and anthropomorphized divinities that give evidence of a belief in magical efficacy. By the 5th century we must also consider the developing interest in marvels (GaupxxTa), portents (TepaTa), and paradoxes (7iap?5o?;a)?phenomena showing nature's inex haustible ability to produce the inexplicable?because portents and marvels at least could be considered magical.46 That is, nature and magic could pro duce effects that were indistinguishable. Because such phenomena were pos sible in the context of nature, even if they came to be considered by some in the 4th century as subject in principle to mechanical causes, the efficacy of magic remained at least provisionally admissible.47 For contemporary scholarship there are consequences that result from this classical Greek view. It is common to read definitions of magic that depend upon some notion of the "supernatural."48 The term is rarely defined, how ever, and terminology is not all that is at issue here. Although expressions in Greek such as i)7t?p(pDri? may mean "overgrown"49 or "extraordinary,"50 and 45 For the Teichines see I Pi. 0.7.95; for the Idean Dactyls, see Hes. fr. 282 Merkelbach West, D. S. 5.64.4-7, and the discussion of Graf 1999. 46 For the 5th century Herodotus is crucial; see Thomas 135-67, with further bibliog raphy at 154 n. 57. For extensive treatment of these phenomena see Gordon 1999:168-78. 47 On the 4th century see Lloyd 1979: 51-52, citing Arist. Ph. 199b4-5 and G A 770b9 14. 48 Examples include: Fowler 317, Faraone 1999: 16, Versnel 1996: 909 and 1991: 187, Jordan 151, Segal 1981: 368, Aune 1515, Nock 315, Halliday 10. The issue of whether a natural/supernatural division in phenomena was relevant to cultures studied by anthro pologists was much debated in the 1960s. See Wax and Wax 1963. For example, although I distance myself from their dated notions of "power" and "magical world view" as too monolithic, cf. Wax and Wax 1962: 182-83, "We Westerners tend to see Power as refer ring to something awesome and wonderful like a miracle, involving a force superior or contrary to the 'laws of Nature.' Viewed by a person in the magical world, Power is awe some and wonderful but, at the same time, it is an intrinsic feature of the natural order, manifesting itself in much of what we (but not he) would consider 'common or 'ordi nary.'"

CAUSALITY AND MAGIC When we inquire into the causes of an event, we are confronted with a myriad of possibilities, and the more a situation is analyzed into its constituent parts, the more the causal possibilities multiply. Contemporary Anglo-American jurisprudence singles out the proximate cause, that is, a necessary cause near enough to the target "event" (viz. damage, injury, loss, etc.) in space and time to be considered a sufficient one.55 This convention helps to guide the court in the determination of moral responsibility. The argument is traceable through Francis Bacons famous maxim injure non remota sed pr?xima causa spectatur (Maxims of the Law, Regula 1), but can already be found in a non legal context in Aristotle (Ph. 2.3.194b24-195b30, 2.5.197a21-5; Metaph. 5.2.1013b28-1014a7; cf. EN 3.1?5). Even in the contemporary legal context, however, the spatial metaphor underlying proximate cause is generally re garded as inadequate to serve as a main criterion of responsibility.56 In antiq uity the argument of proximate cause was even less salient. 51 Arist. Ph. 197b35. 52 Cf. Lloyd 1979: 27, "Even when we have to deal with the divine, the divine is in no sense supernatural" (italics in original). Luckmann argues briefly (678) that the opposi tion between the supernatural and the empirical is a pernicious legacy of 19th-century scientism, though his distinction between "ordinary" and "extraordinary" reality may sim ply reinscribe the same opposition. 53 Collins 2002: 480, following Lloyd 1979: 31-32. A clear break, extending beyond Aristotle, appears to have been made by Theophrastus in Meteorology 14.14-29 (Daiber), according to which divinity is responsible for order in the world, and nature itself is in herently disorderly. See Mansfeld 1992: 318-20. 54 Crick 116. 55 Hart and Honor? 1956 and 1959. 56 Hart and Honor? 1959: 81-82.</page><page sequence="14">30 Derek Collins The problem of causality in situations of injury or illness was acute for the Greeks of the 5th and 4th centuries, when we witness several attempts by in tellectuals (including tragedians, historians, orators, and physicians) to un derstand it.57 Their explanations are revealing both in the attempt itself and by virtue of the fact that determination of cause often implies competing, and at times utterly incompatible, views of agency. Agency, in fact, was continu ally at issue. This period is important in the present connection because it is also when magic first emerges as an object of critique, mainly in the Hippocratic authors and Plato. Yet the intellectuals' critiques had no discernible influence on magical practice, even if they can be located within a much wider trend toward rationalistic inquiry into nature.58 In my view, there are several reasons for this: first, magical causation was difficult to distinguish from divine agency, whose influence could not be excluded from pre-Aristotelian attempts to rationalize causality.59 Magic, like divinity, operated according to the principle of actio in distans?for ex ample, a defixio buried in a well could bind the tongue of an orator in court? making it impossible to exclude it as a cause even when other more "imme diate" and visible causes for an event could be found.60 Second, magic was based in volition; that is, a person used magic to achieve a desired outcome. While magic might combine mechanical and ideological processes within it, volitional causation was not in principle incompatible with these processes.61 Some examples of causal explanation in the 5th and 4th centuries will demonstrate the complexities of the issues in cases of injury, illness, or death. These passages do not concern magic, but can be used to study how causal explanation proceeded and where it foundered. We begin with Thucydides' account of the Athenian plague in 430 (2.47-54). The year had been unusually free from disease, he says, and yet men, from no apparent cause (7Cp09ae&gt;i?62), who were otherwise in good health, suddenly fell ill (2.49.1-2). Attempts at warding off the disease were unsuccessful (2.47.4): 57 Useful discussions of the development of mechanical cause in Hankinson 51-83 and Vegetti. 58 Lloyd 1987: 10-58. 59 Collins 2001:482. 601 use the medieval scholastic phrase metaphorically; I do not imply that the con comitant natural philosophy underlay ancient magic. 61 This means that an approach to magic such as Ritner's (46), which relies on "simple laws of cause and effect," even acknowledging as he does that such a view is serviceable from a Western cultural perspective, is inadequate because more than one causal process has to be accounted for. 62 Vegetti (287 n. 11) argues that rcpcxpocGi? means "pretext" rather than "mechanical cause " but the argument seems strained.</page><page sequence="15">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 31 ouxe y?cp ?ccTpoi fipKouv to rcpcoxov 8epa7uet)Ovxe? ?yvo?a, ?XX' a?xoi ja?Aaaxa e?vnaKov ?aco Kai [l?Xxaxa TCpoorjaav, ouxe ???,r| ?vGpome?a x?%vr| o?Seuaa ?oa xe rcpo? iepo?? ?K?xeuaav ti jaavxeioi?

For neither did the physicians, treating it at first in ignorance, ward off (sc. the disease), indeed they themselves died most inasmuch as they were most exposed to it, nor did any other human skill. However much they supplicated sanctuar ies or used oracles and things like that, all were useless. Finally they desisted from these things, overcome by the evil. Thucydides' account here and later, when he adopts an explicitly empirical approach toward the symptoms of the outbreak (2.49-50), is usually taken as an instance of the rationalism characteristic of the 5th century, typical of the attitude found in the Hippocratic authors.63 Although he is not a doctor,64 and although he himself declines to give an explanation for the disease (2.48), he is dismissive toward the traditional ("popular") approaches to managing the plague, which included supplication and oracles,65 but he nevertheless reports that oracles testifying to foreknowledge of the plague were in circula tion (2.54). It is more likely that these teleological explanations for the disas ter grew and declined in importance over the course of the outbreak than that they were dispensed with altogether, as Thucydides suggests.66 Thucydides' empirical description of the disease is perhaps most informa tive for our purposes where it fails. He tells us that the disease appeared sud denly (2.48.2 8^a7iivaico?, 2.49.2 ??;a?(pvnc, etc.), which means that it hap pened with no antecedent signs or evident cause. It is therefore not surpris ing that one explanation for the outbreak, given that the Piraeus was the first area to be affected, was that cpapjuaKa had been put into Athenian cisterns by the Peloponnesians.67 The term (p?ppaKov here refers to poison, not "magi cal drug," but what is significant is that the (p?puaKov is conceived of as an 63 E.g., Hankinson 52. 64 He does, however, command a technical knowledge of medical terminology; see Gomme ad2A8.3. 65 A note of hyperbole can be detected in "they desisted from these things, overcome by the evil" and the several other statements to the effect that the Athenians became care less of sacred law (2.52.3), or that piety and impiety were adjudged equally (2.53.4). 66 Cf. Pericles' willingness to have women hang an amulet around his neck, so badly was he suffering from the plague (Plu. Per. 38 = Thphr. Ethics L21 Fortenbaugh). 67 According to Thucydides, there were no springs yet in the Piraeus (2.48.2), whose water had to be supplied from elsewhere. It is not clear how the Peloponnesians entered Attica on this invasion (see Gomme ad2A7.2)&gt; but they penetrated as far south as Laurium (2.55.1), and therefore had ample opportunity to reach the Piraeus.</page><page sequence="16">32 Derek Collins invisible cause that could produce sudden deleterious effects.68 Moreover, the disease affected people differently: some died, others did not, irrespective of the nature of the treatment (2.51.1-3). Thucydides himself suffered from the disease for a time but recovered (2.48.3). The disease, that is, could be de scribed, but not fully explained: spontaneous outbreak, irregular response to treatment, and general unpredictability derail the empirical account. The same dilemma over causation often occurs in the Hippocratic authors when they are faced with unpredictability in their patients.69 Divine influence could, at times, especially in the case of spontaneity (to a?T?jLUXTov), be pos ited as the responsible agent for disease; this was in fact the preferred expla nation for epilepsy (Morb. Sacr. 1.10-12 Grensemann), no doubt in part be cause of its unpredictable onset.70 But opinion on this point was not consis tent, and other Hippocratic authors could write that "the spontaneous" would disappear once the underlying causes were found (de Arte6.14-18).71 Aristotle later analyzes to a?T?uxxTOV as an incidental effect produced by an agency without deliberate choice, while T?^n,, conceived of as a subset of incidental effects, occurred when such a result was produced by a being capable of choice (Ph. 197b 19-23).72 Of T?%r|, he remarks, popular opinion holds that there is something 0e?ov and SaipoviuVcepov in it, making it inscrutable to human intelligence (Ph. 196b6-8).73 Empirical observation is thus confounded when effects are produced from invisible causes. For as the Hippocratic author of On Regimen remarks, "men do not know how to observe the invisible through the visible" (1.11.1-2). Matters were equally complicated when a plurality of causes, invisible or otherwise, was thought responsible for a given effect. The famous late 5th century case of the javelin-thrower is an especially good example.74 An ath lete had killed a man with a javelin, and we are told that Pericles and Protagoras spent an entire day discussing whether the javelin, the one who hurled it, or the judges of the contests, "in the most correct sense" (raTa tov ?pG?TaTOv ?xSyov), ought to be considered the cause of death (amo?; Plu. Per. 36.3). This 68 On cpapjiaKov see Collins 2001: 481 with n. 31. 69 A brief comparison between Thucydides and the Hippocratics, in respect of their general views of divinity, can be found in Jouanna 191-92. 70 See Edelstein 216-17. 71 The argument, however, is sophistic and rhetorical rather than empirical. If to ocm?fiaxov operates, as the author claims, "through something" (?ux ti), then sponta neity is a mere name and has no essential reality (de Arte 6.17-18). 72 See further Hankinson 135-40. 73 Cf. the hostile attitude towards xuxn in the Hippocratic corpus; see Villard. 74 Brief discussion in Hankinson 71-72.</page><page sequence="17">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 33 case is presented by Plutarch as an example of sophistry: Pericles' son, Xanthippus, we are told, broadcast this story in an attempt to bring discredit on his father (Per. 36.2; note tan?opeco). But the case was of more than merely sophistic interest. A similar case is at issue in Antiphon s Second Tetralogy, where the further possibility is considered that the deceased himself was re sponsible in that he ran into the path of the javelin (3.2.4-5). An additional factor raised, but not considered in any depth, is that the boy's trainer had called him onto the field at the fatal moment, a point that would shift respon sibility perhaps to the trainer (3.3.6, 3.4.4). None of these issues is resolved, of course, since this speech is an exercise, but a further possibility beyond human action is also indirectly suggested. The father of the dead boy remarks that it would not be just to acquit the javelin-thrower merely because of the misfortune of his error (3.3.8), ei u?v y?p am? unSejaia? ?7ciu??,eia? to? Geo?

But if on the other hand divine punishment falls on someone who acted impiously, it is not just to hinder divine retribution. The consideration of empirical causality here does not exclude divine influ ence. Indeed it raises the possibility that "mere" human error may be impli cated in an invisible network of divine retribution, and that the effects of human error and divine retribution may appear the same. Perhaps the best-known instance of unintentional homicide in the 5th century comes not from Greek history or law but from tragedy, from Sophocles' Oedipus plays. Many of the points already made, from the sudden onset of plague to the inscrutability of T\)%n, all of which are reducible to human actions whose causes are unknown and yet are divinely foreordained, can be found thematized by Sophocles. So much is straightforward. But for our purposes it is worth underscoring the temporal and spatial aspects of causality emphasized by these plays. In Oedipus' words (OC 969-73), 87CE?

The nexus of cause and effect here does not depend on contiguity in time or space. Oedipus' dilemma is not much different from that of Croesus, whose envoys were told by the Pythia that the fall of the Lydian empire was repay ment for a religious sin committed by an ancestor five generations earlier (Hdt. 1.91.1; note ?juapTcx?). Thus to the general problem of the plurality of causes, some of which may or may not be visible, we have also to add the protracted way in which effects could occur. Of course a temporal disjunction between cause and effect is usual in the context of curses and divination, which as we saw earlier in the case of the Athenian plague often involves understanding some present misfortune in the context of a past prophecy.75 To summarize: within this flexible system of causality, so much at issue among intellectuals of the Classical period, an event can be caused by factors invisible and visible, human and divine, present and past, as well as proxi mate and remote. All of these causal conditions might hold true for a given event at the same time because they are not mutually exclusive. Accordingly, to take the Athenian plague, an event can result from the intersection of mechanical (cpcxppcxKa), ideological (fulfillment of Athenian and Spartan prophecies), and volitional (harm intended by the Peloponnesians) causes? indeed, it is important to see that a mechanical cause can result from both ideological and volitional processes.76 The relevant point for classical Greece is that because these processes can and do overlap, magic, which assumes that volition can cause events removed in time and space, remains a possible explanation for certain types of event. We owe to Frazer the idea that magic operates according to a mistaken no tion of empirical (mechanical) causality, but this does not mean that there is no causal process in magic. With the possible exception of Tambiah (1985), Frazer's students (including Malinowski) failed to see that magic can be causal in a very different way: magic can be understood as an expression of desire, and therefore implies volitional causation.77 751 have written further on this, in the context of bird divination, in Collins 2002:22-26. 76 This is a point made by Russell 206-8. 77 As Gell 1998: 101 writes, "Magic registers and publicizes the strength of desire."</page><page sequence="19">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 35 The recipes in the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri amply testify to the volitional nature of magic. Many of the recipes have titles or state explicitly the end for which they are to be used (mpi + genitive,78 rarely eni + genitive79). One employs the spell because one desires to achieve a certain end. Many of the recipes in fact use the verb ?G?tao in directing the practitioner. The be ginning of the following spell is a good illustration (PGM VII.407-8): "If you want (eciv... ?9??,n?) to appear to someone at night in dreams, say to the lamp in use by day, say many times ...." Similarly, another spell (PGM III.495?96) claims that it is a procedure "for every [rite], for everything, for whatever you want" (mpl cov ??cv O?[?x|]?). Other examples could be cited, but it is already clear that the recipes are composed with a view toward realizing the practitioner's intentions.80 The nec essary corollary is that the person who is affected by magic is affected because s/he is the target of others' intentions.81 The practical effects of this view are not hard to understand: if I desire to surpass a fellow blacksmith in business, and so deposit a deftxio in the Agora, then if my business does excel his, can I be sure that my intention did not cause it?82 Or, as Plato has Socrates ask his companions in the Phaedo (98c-99b), is he sitting in jail because his body is composed of sinews and joints, which contract and relax in a particular way, or is he there because he, as a desiring agent, thought it better to submit to the penalties imposed upon him by the Athenians than to run away?83 Both mechanical and voli tional causes play a part in this scenario. Exactly when to distinguish between these causes to explain a given event is largely a matter of cultural convention, and it is their non-exclusivity in the Greek world that makes magic possible. Plato seems to have understood this, at least in part. In a passage that we have already discussed briefly, he speaks of two types of magic (cpapuocKeia). The first involves harm caused by drinks (twduxxto:), foods (?pc?jiocTa), or un guents (?Xe?uuncTOc). This type of magic, although it is mechanical for Plato because it involves "harm by means of matter against matter according to nature" (Lg. 11.933a acouncai gcouxxtoc KccKODpyouacx ?cm koctcx (p?aiv), nev 78E.g.,PGMIII.162and495. 79PGMVII.405and661. 80 For other examples see PGM IV. 1266 and 1720, XIII.239,260,275,283,321, etc. 81 These intentions are not entirely reducible to envy or malice (cpGovo?), "ce moteur de la sorcellerie," as Bernand 85-105 (quotation on 86) would have it, but at least his approach correctly situates Greek magic within a volitional context. 821 am thinking here of a defixio such as that at lordan 159, no. 20. 83 Gell 1998:101 offers a similar example: if a boiled egg sits before someone ready to be eaten, is it there because of the mechanical processes of heat applied to a pan contain ing the egg and water, or is it there because that person wanted to eat a boiled egg?</page><page sequence="20">36 Derek Collins ertheless incorporates a notion of intention.84 But his main point is that me chanical agents have mechanical properties that, when they interact, produce expected results.85 In addition to the substances listed by Plato, we can place purifications and cpapuocKa in this category of magic. The second type of magic for Plato is based on the anxieties and fears pro duced in its victims. Plato, it would seem, suggests that this kind of magic (yor|T??a86) operates on primarily psychological grounds and is at bottom a matter of belief (Lg. 933a-b): aM-ri ?? r\ uor/yaveiai?

The other type is that which, by means of enchantments and spells and so-called bindings, persuades those attempting to harm their victims that they can do so, and persuades the victims that they really are being harmed by those ca pable of bewitching (yonTeueiv). With respect to this and all such matters, it is neither easy to recognize what has happened, nor, if one knows, is it easy to persuade others. With regard to men s souls, it is not worth trying to persuade those who are suspicious of one another about such things, if some of them see molded wax images either at their doorways or at the places where three roads meet or on the tombs of their ancestors themselves, nor to admonish those who do not have a clear belief about all such things to make light of them. Plato characterizes the efficacy of magic as based on mistaken belief and sug gests, not unlike many modern scholars, that at least his second type of magic would disappear if its practitioners understood (mechanical) causality.87 But this fails to take into account volitional cause, which as we have seen is so common that it can be misrecognized for mechanical cause. Recognizing 84 The language (Lg. Il .932e3-4 ?iccbv 8K rcpovoioc?) recalls the Athenian homicide law against poisoning (D. 23.22). 85 Cf. Lg. 10.889b on the interactions of hot and cold, dry and moist, soft and hard. 86 For more on yonxeia and the yon? see Johnston 1999:102-23, though I stress again that by the 4th century terminological distinctions are largely lost. 87 Clark's (441) critique of Evans-Pritchard (63-83,99-106), who was also susceptible to this prejudice, is instructive in this regard.</page><page sequence="21">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 37 "what has happened," as Plato puts it, is insufficient because it assumes that only one (mechanical) causal system can be operative at a time. And yet an individual who died "because" of a magical cp?puocKOV can also have died "be cause" an adversary intended him harm and arranged for the (pcxppocKov to be administered. So let us complete the causal nexus in Plato's example: the molded wax images are visible reminders to "those who are suspicious of one another about such things" that injurious or harmful intentions have been expressed. Causes, which can be separated in space and time, have the poten tial to be plural, and multiple causal processes (mechanical, teleological, vo litional) can produce the same event. This means that, in the end, when some thing does go wrong for the person who is the target of the wax figurine, vis ible, immediate, mechanical causes of the event maybe compatible with, and explicable in terms of, the harmful intentions of the adversary who made the figurine or had it made. It is crucial to see that in magic, as in other areas of life, these causal processes need not be at odds with one another. 4. AGENCY AND FIGURINES I propose now to approach more directly the operation of magical figurines. In order to do so, however, I must first briefly explain the concept of agency that I will be using here. I will argue that it is agency, and especially social agency as understood by the Greeks, that makes the figurines efficacious in magic. The Presocratic philosophical tradition again offers us a productive route into these issues, but in order to elucidate the magical practices them selves, we will also need to incorporate some anthropological theory. We can best approach the issue of agency by way of the magnet. This stone was already of interest to Tha?es of Miletus (11 A 22 D-K = Arist. de An. 1.2.405al9-2188): 801K8 ??

Thaies, too, seems, from what they record, to have supposed that the soul was something motive, since he said that the stone [i.e., the magnet] has a soul because it moves iron. The magnet continued to be a subject of interest to Presocratic physicists, including those, like Empedocles, who claimed a specific interest in magic.89 88 My arguments being heuristic only, doxographical intrusion does not affect them. 89 Empedocles elaborates a theory of effluences (dercoppoai) to explain the magnet (31 A 89 D-K), which is then taken over by Democritus and integrated into his explanation of the evil eye as eidcoXa that emanate from the eye (68 A 77 D-K = Plu. Mor. 682F-83A).</page><page sequence="22">38 Derek Collins But what concerns us at present is the observation of motion, which Tha?es explains by the presence of a soul (\|fi)xr|) within the rock. The fact that the magnet causes iron to move?ai?rjpov kive?? indicates to Tha?es that it possesses agency, or, as he puts it, a soul.90 The example of the magnet is only one instance of a much wider generali zation that Tha?es makes: all objects capable of motion or of causing motion can be viewed as containers that house souls, and can act on the world around them by virtue of this motive agency.91 Furthermore, agency is not aimless but directed. "Direction" here means that objects capable of motion or of creating it must possess intention or will. According to Tha?es, it is not ob jects that are self-animated and self-directed but the souls within them. Agency in this sense, then, is ascribed to objects that intentionally cause events in their vicinity.92 Of course stones in the natural world are for the Greeks only one of many things possessing or housing agency, including animals, plants, people, and anything else capable of intentionally causing events.93 But agency also has a social dimension. As the anthropologist Alfred Gell has argued, any object, whether from our point of view animate or inanimate, that acts or is treated like a person can be considered a social agent. This defi nition has a surprisingly wide and occasionally counter-intuitive application. Stones that are anointed with oil and wrapped in wool,94 for example, are social agents, because to anoint and clothe them is to treat them like people.95 An especially vivid example is found in Pausanias' description of the Bouphonia before the altar of Zeus Polieus at Athens. After allowing the ox to feed on the 90 See further Hankinson 12-13. 91 Hence his famous claim that "everything is full of gods" ( 11 A 22 D-K = Arist. de An. 1.5.41 la7). Other physicists offer modified versions of this panpsychist claim, and attribute agency to particular natural elements (the planets, stars, wind, heat, cold, mois ture, etc.); see further below. 921 rely heavily on Gell 1998:16-21,134 and passim for this and the following discus sion. 93 By "cause" here I mean "volitional cause," a cause that is perceived to be intentional, and not a cause in the (Western) sense of purely mechanistic, empirically verifiable laws. 94 For example, the famous stone at Delphi, witnessed by Pausanias (10.24.6). As Faraone 1992:5-6 has shown, such practices with stones (whether meteors or otherwise) were widespread throughout the Mediterranean. 95 In this paper I treat social agency as if it were monolithic. Of course it is not, be cause not all social agents are of equivalent status. Stones wrapped in wool, for example, maybe treated like babies (cf. the stone swaddled by Gaia to replace Zeus in Hes. Th. 485), while other objects may be treated like adults, and so forth. Further work could be done to show how groups of social agents are aligned with one another.</page><page sequence="23">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 39 barley and grain at the altar, one of the priests kills the ox with an axe and then departs. "The other priests then bring the axe to trial, as though they do not know the man who committed the deed."96 What is of interest in the present context is not the aetiology of the ritual or Pausanias' explanation of it, but rather that, at the moment of "trial," the axe acts like a person, like a social agent with moral responsibility.97 It might be objected at this point that to "treat" an object like a person is different than for that same object to "act" like a person, as if the distinction were between passivity and activity, but this is a problem more terminological than real. According to Gell's theory, from the point of view of a given culture, the objects in question are social entities, which means that from an outsider's viewpoint they are both treated and act like people. We can illustrate social agency further by looking at the treatment of effi gies.98 To make offerings to statues, such as the monthly food offerings set out before the statuettes of Hecate,99 is to treat them in significant respects like people.100 ?oocvoc101 were regularly cleaned and dressed in new robes, a prac tice that was preserved in the Panathenaic procession, in which a new nenXoq was presented to the statue of Athena. Prayer was addressed to cult statues (Hdt. 6.61) because direct communication with divinity could take place through them (A. Eu. 242). But we need not limit our examples to a specifically religious, or Greek context. Despondency over the loss of Helen led Menelaus to take no plea sure in well-formed statues (koXogoo?), according to the chorus in Agamemnon (415-16); as Fraenkel saw, these could well be Kopai adorning the palace grounds.102 Yet it is possible that such statues offered more than merely aesthetic interest: consider the practice of the Egyptian king Mycerinus, 96 Paus. 1.24.4-5. A more elaborate and aetiological account is given in Porph. Abst. 2.29-30. In Porphyry, we are told that each priest was charged and then given the oppor tunity to defend himself, while the axe was convicted of murder because it could not re spond. 97 Cf. Katz 171-77. 98 Background in Burkert 88-95; briefer treatment in Faraone 1992: 28-29, with n. 86. For the approach taken here, I have derived much from Spivey 47-51, Eisner, and Gordon 1979. 99 Ar. PI. 594-97, with I 594. 100 General background on food and other types of offerings, either as first fruits or votives, are discussed by Burkert 66-70, who rightly does not draw a sharp distinction between them (68). 101A brief survey of the Greek terminology for statuary can be found in Spivey 45-46. 102 Fraenkel ad 416, with Ducat 249.</page><page sequence="24">40 Derek Collins son of Cheops, who liked to keep wooden ko?oggo? of his concubines, in the form of naked women, in a special chamber (Hdt. 2.130).103Menelaus' KO^oaaoi could be social agents of this same general type. In later antiquity, we find many related examples (e.g., Lucian Syr. D. 36-7, Paus. 3.16.7-11) of Greek statues treated like (erotic) social agents, none of which can be more striking than the traditions of individuals actually conceiving a passion for and having sex with statues, sometimes successfully.104 In the same vein are the numerous ancient stories about Daedalus' sculptures, which were legend ary because they were for all intents and purposes alive.105 This is not to con fuse the development of realism or naturalism in Greek statuary with its "re ligious" functions, but rather to see that, in respect of social agency, there is no sharp dividing line between them. Greek cenotaphs offer another example. Often these would contain stone or clay effigies of individuals who had either died away from home or whose bodies were otherwise irrecoverable.106 For example, according to Herodotus, when Spartan kings were slain in war, images (ri'?co?xx) of the king were made, carried out on a bier for all to see, and then buried (Hdt. 6.58). The effigies are treated like real bodies and in this sense could be said to substitute for them.107 But the notion of "substitute" can be misleading and is in any case inadequate. From the point of view of social agency these effigies are the dead individuals, not substitutes. The fashioning of mummies in Egypt, as recounted by Herodotus (2.85 89), offers another instance, insofar as mummies involve making a once-living body into a hollow image of itself. At least among the wealthy, such embalmed mummies were enclosed in wooden coffins and kept inside their homes for a time leaning against a wall (2.86). Here again the dividing line between liv ing human being and image remains indeterminate. And the Egyptians were keen to keep that shifting boundary in mind. According to another report by 103 Cf. Childs 35-36,42, who argues that statues lose their "aura de magie" in the 5th century. This is clearly not the case for the "popular" perception of statuary. 104 Ath. 605f-606b: examples include Cleisophus of Selymbria's attempt to sleep with a statue of Parian marble in Samos, and the anonymous Becopo? who visited Delphi and slept with a stone image of a boy there, for which he left a wreath as the "price of the in tercourse." The Delphians consulted the oracle and found Apollo to be forgiving. In Pliny (Nat. 36.21) we hear of man who fell in love and slept with the statue of Aphrodite on Cnidus, leaving a stain as a cupiditatis index. 105 Detailed discussion of these traditions in Frontisi-Ducroux 100-108. 106 Yjartz and Boardman 257-59, with examples from Cyprus, Thera, Athens, and Locri in South Italy. See also Faraone 1991a: 183-84. 107 The issue of statues as substitutes is dealt with by Ducat.</page><page sequence="25">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 41 Herodotus, at the banquets of wealthy men, after the meal a man carried round a carefully carved wooden image of a corpse in a coffin, one or two cubits long, and exhorted each banqueter: "while looking on this, drink and enjoy; for such shall you be when dead" (2.78). It is worth asking oneself how far the Egyptians intended this remark to be taken literally.108 Finally I turn to dolls (Kopn, -o?; v?uxpn; Latin puppa; cf. mania, bulla, effigies, imago) in Greek and Roman antiquity, which offer a more precise comparison to human beings. Many examples of ancient dolls have been found, made of wood, bone, wax, fabric, clay, precious metal, and other ma terials.109 The care that is often given to their clothing, hair, lips, and adorn ment generally may be taken as further evidence of the effort made to endow them with social agency, although little evidence survives for the manner in which they were used by children in play.110 Be that as it may, it would be a mistake to think that Greek and Roman children "played" with dolls in a manner totally unlike adults, or that doll "play" has nothing to do with the ritual treatment of cult or funerary statues?in terms of social agency, cult statues are big dolls.111 As an example of how ritual and play involving dolls can overlap, consider the tradition, first attested in Herodotus (2.48), of me chanical dolls operated with strings (ayaXjaocra vei)p?G7iaGTa) and carried by Egyptian women through their villages during the festival of "Dionysus." Apart from minor differences in detail, these dolls are indistinguishable from the mechanical dolls mentioned by Plato, which puppeteers manipulated with strings on stage.112 Certainly, cult statues are images of divinities, whereas ancient dolls, like the ones represented in the hands of little girls on Attic grave reliefs, are not.113 But social agency is not a function of the ultimate identifi cation or reference of a given object, nor of its nature, but of its being treated like a human being. Some ancient evidence, however, does in fact point to an explicit connection between dolls and cult, and a rather serious one at that, 108 Lloyd 1975-88 ad 78 gives examples of excavated figurines that resemble Herodotus' description. Cf. Ritner 51, "Gods, humans, animals, objects, actions, and words are all part of a fluid continuum of projected divine images without sharp divisions." 109 Hurschmann is brief but helpful. 110 Hurschmann 601-2. 111 Gell 1998: 134. 112 PL R. 514a-515a. In Lg. (644d), Plato uses the puppet manipulated by strings as a metaphor for man's relationship to the gods. These and other examples are discussed by Wagner-Holzhausen. The tradition of self-propelled marionettes or ocutOuoctoc (e.g., Arist. GA 734b 10, Metaph. 983al4-l5) may also be brought up in this connection; see Wagner Holzhausen 603. 113 Hurschmann 602.</page><page sequence="26">42 Derek Collins insofar as K?pai were dedicated to Artemis by girls preparing for marriage (AP 6.280), pupae were dedicated to Venus by unwed girls in Rome (Pers. 2.70, Var. Men. 4), while boys, for different reasons, dedicated bullae to the Lares (Pers. 5.31; cf. Hor. S. 1.5.65-66).114 From the point of view of ritual and so cial agency, then, there is no clear distinction between children's dolls and the divinities, embodied in statuary form, to whom they were dedicated. We can now locate "magical" figurines within this nexus of social agency. (I put "magical" in quotation marks because by this point I hope to have es tablished that the social agency of objects is not limited in Greek, Roman, and other Mediterranean cultures to what those cultures, let alone a modern ob server, might consider "magical." Social agency is a much wider notion and the use of figurines in magic can be seen as one expression of it.) Christopher Faraone has recently synthesized the evidence for figurines in lead, clay, and wax that were employed in magic throughout the Mediterranean basin from the second millenium b.c.e. down to the 6th century ce.115 As is well known, these figurines often give visible expression to the action of binding, and hence are usually classed with other types of defixiones. In an intuitive series of as sociations of great importance for the present discussion, Faraone situates the binding of these figurines in a wider context that includes both mythical sto ries that involve the binding of divinities (e.g., Ares) and cult statues (e.g., Enyalius) that are chained or in some manner tied down. Numerous examples of such bound statues are attested later, for instance by Pausanias.116 The answer given to the question why the figurines and statues are bound usually invokes Frazerian "sympathy" together with Stanley Tambiah's defi nition of magical speech as "persuasive."117 Tambiah's approach avoids the Frazerian mistake of viewing magic as founded on false views of causation, but he relies still too heavily on analogical thinking.118 The ancient Greek treat 114 Cf. the tradition on the eve of the Compitalia, when dolls of both male and female form, said to indicate free citizens, while balls (pilae), said to indicate slaves, were also dedicated to the Lares; see B?hm 808-10. 115 Faraone 1991a. Brief discussion also in Gager 14-18. 116 E.g., Paus. 3.15.7,3.15.11,9.38.5,10.35.10; see Frontisi-Ducroux 102-3. Cf. PL Men. 97d on the need to bind the statues of Daedalus to keep them from fleeing. 117 E.g., Faraone 1991a: 169 n. 11, on the statue of Ares at Syedra. He concludes later (193) that containment or restraint of enemies is the goal of both the bound effigies and civic statues. Tambiah's most important essays are reprinted in his 1985 book. A more forceful statement of Faraone's reliance on Tambiah for the explanation of figurines can be found in Faraone 1991b: 8. A sharp critique of Tambiah's approach can be found in Gardner, who ar gues that Tambiah relies too heavily on speech and does not sufficiently account for ritual. 118 This point and others are drawn out in the critique of Frazer and Tambiah by Taussig 47-58.</page><page sequence="27">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 43 ment of statuary, as Plato understood, depends not on an analogy, implicit or otherwise, between the statue and what it represents, but on a view of stat ues as themselves capable of agency.119 In language that recalls Tha?es' descrip tion of the magnet, Plato remarks that the ancient laws concerning the gods are twofold (Lg. 931a). Some of the gods that men honor are evident to the senses, he says, but of others, e?K?vcec ay?X?iata iopua?jaevoi, ou? tijli?v ?y?AAoDcu Kocircep ?\|/?youc ovtoc?, ?Keivou? fiyo?|xe0a xo?? ?uAj/?xouc 0?o?? noXXi]v ?i? toc?t' euvoiav Kai %?piv ?%eiv. setting up statues as images, we worship them although they lack souls, and believe that thanks to them the "ensouled" gods are kindly disposed and gra cious to us. I would argue that the qualification I have italicized suggests that, whatever Plato's own view, his contemporaries regarded statues, not as vehicles or mere representations, but as agents, that is, as objects possessing a \\fv%r\.m Recall ing the connection between souls and motion, we may infer that statues were bound not as an analogical gesture but to prevent them from moving.121 In my opinion, we should take seriously this view, as well as the implica tions of treatments of statuary, and suggest that in the creation of magical figurines there is nothing fundamentally "sympathetic" or persuasive at is sue. Nor is there anything "symbolic" at issue: it is not for the sake of symbol ism that one feeds figurines, as is required at Cyrene by the instructions for fashioning KO?oaaoi against a hostile visitant,122 but because that is how they eat. That is, the binding of a figurine is the binding of its agency, not a sym bolic or persuasive act, whether that agency is actualized in movement or in some other form. Magical figurines are possible because they are situated within a pre-existing network of social relations that already contains effigies generally. Their ability to cause events in their vicinity is implied by this net work, an ability I can illustrate further with one final example. 119 For background on Plato's general views on images see Childs. 120 Before Plato, Heraclitus (22 B 5 D-K) had also attacked the worship of ayocXuara "as if one were conversing with houses, not recognizing what gods and heroes are." 121 This is not to deny that analogies were sometimes created. We have binding for mulae, for example, both on tablets and in literature, where the voice of the defigens can claim something on the order of, "As this lead is cold and useless, so may X be cold and useless." See Faraone 1991b: 8, Theoc. 2.28-29. 122 SEG9.72.il 1-21, with Faraone 1992: 82.</page><page sequence="28">44 Derek Collins The 5th-century athlete Theagenes of Thasos was renowned in antiquity for his intimate relationship to bronze statues.123 Recognition of Theagenes' extraordinary strength began in his youth when he carried a bronze cult statue from the marketplace to his house and back again (Paus. 6.11.2-3). After his death, according to Pausanias, a bronze statue in his image was erected, which one of his enemies repeatedly flogged each night as if it were Theagenes him self. "But the statue stopped the outrage by falling on him, and the sons of the man who had died prosecuted the statue for murder" (6.11.6). The pros ecution of the statue immediately reminds us of the axe tried for murder by priests administering the Bouphonia at the altar of Zeus Polieus at Athens (Paus. 1.24.4-5). As social agents, both the axe and the statue of Theagenes can be held legally and morally responsible for their actions. But what is more striking is that Theagenes' statue is capable of responding to the outrage com mitted against it by falling on the abuser, which is exactly what we might ex pect from an injured social agent. Thus statues and magical figurines, because they are social agents, are capable of causing events to happen in their vicin ity, just as their capacity for retributive action can be motivated by binding or abusing them, as is suggested also by the next stages in the story of Theagenes' statue. Found guilty of murder, the statue was exiled into the sea. Famine then racked the Thasians, who were told by the Delphic oracle to re trieve their exiles, which eventually, by way of a second Delphic oracle, was correctly interpreted to include the statue of Theagenes. Fishermen recovered the statue in their nets, and the Thasians set it up in its original position and thenceforth sacrificed to it as to a god (Paus. 6.11.6-9). Once again, abuse, here in the form of exile, is met with retribution, here in the form of plague. The story further suggests that the common practice of burying or disposing of "magical" figurines in wells, graves, or the earth is meant to ensure that once their retributive capacity has been activated by abuse it will remain in effect, since with the figurine hidden its abuse cannot generally be undone. Theagenes' statue, after all, had to be retrieved from the sea before its anger could be appeased.124 If this inference is correct, it is the perpetual rather than a momentary arousal of anger or retribution in the "magical" figurines that is harnessed and targeted at the intended victim. In any case, through social agency and the treatment of Greek statuary we derive a more coherent pic ture of why figurines are bound and buried than by attributing these prac tices to causal processes peculiar to an ill-defined notion of "magic." 123 Paus. 6.11.2-10. Cf. D. Chr. Or. 31.95-99, Eus. PE 5.34; see Eisner 527-28. 124 Note that the legal banishment of "inanimate objects" (tog oc\j/u%a) convicted of murder is attributed by Pausanias to Draco (6.11.6).</page><page sequence="29">Nature, Cause, and Agency in Greek Magic 45 5. CONCLUSION I have argued that the social practice of magic in Greece, especially in the 5th and 4th centuries b.c.e., depends on a conception of nature animated by di vinity both abstract and anthropomorphized; on overlapping mechanical, teleological, and volitional causes for events; and on agency both as a general feature of nature and as a specific social conception, illustrated here in the context of figurines. None of these conditions is peculiar to magic and none can therefore be used to isolate distinctive features of this elusive phenom enon. I have not included all types of Greek magic in the discussion, but what I hope to have shown is that Greek magic is derivative of other processes and concepts in Greek culture, each of which should, in principle, be definable in historical and culturally specific terms.125 WORKS CITED Aune, D.
