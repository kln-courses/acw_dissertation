E-mail: emeyers@interchange. ubc. ca Every day millions of children ages four to 12 login to shared virtual environments (SVEs) where they play, socialize, create, and explore a digital landscape as avatars, or "virtual characters." While much of the research and media attention has been fo- cused on adult virtual environments such as Second Life, or massive multiplayer games like World of Warcraft, children's virtual worlds comprise the largest and fast- est growing segments of this online genre. Virtual environments are quickly becoming an important aspect of children's out-of-school lives. The challenge for educators is to see how virtual spaces may be leveraged for learning and literacy. This article pro- vides an overview of children's virtual environments and presents a four-part frame- work for further analyzing these spaces. The author posits that SVEs may be viewed as (1 ) an identity space; (2) a new "literacy"; (3) a problem-solving context; and (4) an on- line community. The article concludes by suggesting a research program for the con- tinued exploration of SVEs and the rich array of information practices that surround their use by young people. Keywords: virtual worlds; information literacy; information seeking; children and youth; cognitive ethnographic methods Introduction elementary school librarian in Washington State (US) was reading a book on penguins to a class of second grade students (age seven to eight years). One of girls interrupted to ask: "Can real penguins be more colors than just black and white?" She went on to explain that, in Club Penguin (CP; http://www. clubpenguin.com), a shared virtual envi- ronment for preteens, her penguin could be any color, even pink! The animated discussion that followed revealed that many of the students in the class knew a great deal about CP, and were regular vis- itors to this digital snow-covered land of fun and adventure. CP, just one of an ar- ray of new Web-based shared virtual en- vironments (SVEs) for children as young as seven, received over 2.6 million unique visitors during November 2008. The Internet is offering more opportu- nities for youth to engage in virtual inter- actions that extend beyond their real- world antecedents. More than just an online phenomenon, social network sites such as MySpace (http://www.myspace. com) and SVEs such as Teen Second Life (http://teen.secondlife.com) have be- come information portals for the devel- oping social worlds of young people. Preteen virtual worlds have emerged as exciting new entries in this field: intoxi- cating and engaging for children, but causing consternation for parents who fear the potential dangers and perceived developmental effects of these immersive virtual spaces. Parents and child advocates have expressed concern J. of Education for Library and Information Science, Vol. 50, No. 4 - Fall 2009 226 ISSN: 0748-5786 ©2009 Association for Library and Information Science Education</page><page sequence="2">Tip of the Iceberg: Meaning, Identity, and Literacy in Preteen Virtual Worlds 221 over child protections and the potential for these sites to negatively alter real-life pro-social development (e.g., Flanagan, 2007; Slatalla, 2007). Little is known, however, about the impact these sites may have on preteens, even though the sites themselves suggest the activities of- fer potential benefits (communication and typing skills, budgeting money, car- ing for pets, etc.). For example, while many of these sites promote safe and re- sponsible use of the Internet, a number of correspondingly negative practices have emerged, such as a community of young users who glorify cheating CP's reward system, publishing their rebellious exploits on blogs and YouTube (Benderoff, 2007). This article explores an exploding seg- ment of the online universe: shared vir- tual environments designed for children between the ages of seven and thirteen years. The focus is narrow, but critical; the preteen years are a key developmental period during which children build their personal and social identity. Nearly all the research in this field focuses on adults or teens, who have greater autonomy and maturity; thus, the absence of research in this area represents a potentially danger- ous oversight. The article begins by in- troducing researchers and practitioners to these children and the online worlds they inhabit. A framework for examining these worlds using a social practice per- spective is proposed, followed by a case example drawn from the author's partici- pant observation of one virtual world: Club Penguin. The article concludes with a research agenda for the study of virtual environments as contexts for youth infor- mation behavior, as well as the implications such studies may hold for researchers in LIS. Online SVEs for Preteens: An Emergent Genre Preteens, also referred to variously as the 'Net Generation, Millenials, and Dig- ital Natives, have known of and used the Internet and World Wide Web their entire lives. Recent surveys (Roberts, Foehr, &amp; Rideout, 2005) of children's digital me- dia use (ages eight to 1 0) suggest a grow- ing proportion of their non-school hours are consumed with playing video games, web surfing, and online correspondence. Many children are drawn to online virtual environments because of the social expe- riences they provide. As preteens are de- veloping their personalities, their concept of the social self, and a nascent moral sense, (Harter, 1998; Wigfield, Byrnes, &amp; Eccles, 2006). richly immersive virtual spaces are presenting new opportunities to explore. The last two years have seen a dra- matic increase in the number of online SVEs targeting the pre-MySpace demo- graphic, as well as the Internet traffic di- rected to these sites. It is estimated that over 10 million children and adults use these sites in North America and around the world, and usage is increasing. De- spite their popularity and mention in the popular press, very little research litera- ture exists about these sites. No pub- lished research in LIS addresses this media genre, although some research is emerging in cognate fields. Scholars in the area of literacy and media studies have recently begun describing and ana- lyzing these sites in terms of reading and writing practices (Marsh, 2008; Mer- chant, 2009). Table 1 describes the characteristics of six SVEs designed expressly for pre- teens, and compares them to each other and a popular SVE for adults, Second Life. This table is not meant to be an ex- haustive survey; rather, it illustrates the features of six SVEs that represent differ- ent portions of this market space. Se- lected for inclusion were sites which had ( 1 ) rich, immersive qualities; (2) chat and social networking features; and (3) sig- nificant availability and user appeal (over 200,000 visits per month).

The online presence and the product are mutually exclusive, but the goal is to build excitement for, and drive traffic to, the real-world product. • Commercial Worlds: This category describes virtual environments where the online world itself is the product (e.g. CP) or where the online world and the real-world product are deeply intertwined and mutually supporting. CP charges a fee ($5.95/month) for premium membership. WebKinz, on the other hand, requires the purchase of a plush toy, which then provides a code for online access. • Value Worlds: In this category, virtual environments are expressly non-commercial or attempting to provide rich online experiences without advertising, product sales, or premium membership fees. These sites describe themselves as alternatives to the commercially-based sites described above, in terms of both values and market strategy. As both of these sites are new entries in the field, it is unclear how long they will remain non-commercial. As represented in blogs and parent fo- rums, the commercial or non-commercial nature of a given S VE appears to be an im- portant factor to both parents and children (e.g., http://www.commonsensemedia. org/ or http://familyinternet. about, com/). It dramatically affects the extent to which children can participate in the activities of these worlds. Sites that offer premium membership subscriptions ($5-6/month) often reserve many activi- ties for those who subscribe at this level. As membership is reflected in the appear- ance of a child' s avatar in the world, there is tremendous social pressure on children (and consequently their parents) to pay these premiums. Each of the sites in- cluded in this analysis, with the excep- tion of WebKinz, offers a free or basic-level subscription. Beyond their varying economic pro- files, SVEs have numerous features in common. They allow children to create an avatar, or virtual character, and to move that avatar through the various spaces (islands, rooms, neighborhoods) represented in the world. The avatars and their homes or rooms can be decorated with a wide array of furnishings and ac- cessories. Playing games or engaging in various adventures scripted within the world permits children to earn virtual currency, which can be spent on addi- tional virtual accessories, clothing, and furniture. Many of the activities in these worlds are consumer-oriented; children spend a great deal of their time shopping or working/playing in order to afford more virtual possessions. Status in these worlds is frequently represented in osten- tatious displays: novices (or those who cannot afford the premium membership) are quickly distinguished from more experienced players by their lack of swag. While sociability is a key part of the al- lure of these worlds, activity is balanced by concerns for safety and anonymity for all users. Moderated chat with parental controls is another common feature of preteen SVEs. Parents have the option to permit open, moderated chat for their children, or "safe" chat, which limits the user to preselected words and phrases, such as "Hi!" or "Want to be friends?" Children are discouraged (or disallowed in some SVEs) from providing any per- sonal information during chat with other participants. General rules of politeness and speech are enforced by adult modera- tors, who may be either volunteers or em- ployees. Violators are given warnings, or banned from the site for flagrant and persistent bad behavior.</page><page sequence="5">230 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE SVEs permit children to explore a wide array of activities on their own or with others. Beyond games and adven- tures, which are updated frequently to maintain interest, SVEs host parties and social events, often based on holi- days or themes. Blogs, virtual newspa- pers, or updates to the entry page of the SVE inform users of new features of the virtual space. In addition to general so- cial gatherings, most SVEs permit users to host their own parties, or invite friends to visit a home/room/igloo for small group socializing. In general, these sites provide a structure that closely approximates an elementary school playground, complete with play, reward structures, and socialization op- portunities. The attendant problems of semi-structured or unstructured youth spaces are present as well: rebellion, cliques, status hierarchies, and identity games. No two SVEs are alike. Different fea- tures and interactive designs will appeal to different ages and genders, and the range of available worlds supports this diversity. BarbieGirls, for example, is explicitly girl-centric (and very pink). Webkinz, which employs stuffed animals as the entrée to the virtual space, is more attractive to younger tweens and chil- dren. It is also suggested by blogs and discussion boards that, as children ma- ture, their activities in the virtual worlds change focus; as they grow older and more experienced, they use these spaces differently. Older tweens and teens are present in CP, but they are drawn more to the chat capabilities than the games, and use the penguin avatars for creative pur- poses, such as machinima music videos, e.g., Bad Day in Club Penguin by Tehkraziboi, (http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=pQAUMzLUVYw). KZero (http://www.kzero.co.uk/) a company that tracks virtual world trends, posits that children's SVEs is the largest and fastest growing segment of this online genre. Framework for Analyzing SVEs for Preteens What emerges from an initial examina- tion of preteen virtual worlds is that they are as interactive as many adult-oriented video games and more immersive than in- formational websites. They are online spaces where children learn to socialize with others, interact around shared expe- riences, create their own digital stories, and acquire new information age skills. To recognize the power and potential of these spaces for learning and information behavior, one must adopt a sociocultural view of literacy. From this perspective, literacy practices are conditioned by their cultural, historical and social contexts, both in and out of formal institutions such as school (Gee, 1996; Heath, 1983; Street, 1995). Kress (2003) argues such literacies include multiple modes of in- formation and communication, including print and digital forms. This broader con- ception of literacy recognizes that infor- mation-rich practices occur across contexts, including everyday life, and these in and out of school practices have a number of intersection points (Gee, 2008a). Second grade students who learn about penguins in school resolve this knowledge with their out-of-school experiences as anthropomorphic penguin avatars. A common approach to youth informa- tion seeking has been to view literacy as either: (1) a process of decoding and en- coding text, i.e., reading and writing pro- ficiency; or (2) a set of information-based skills focused on finding and evaluating information, i.e., research. In applying these school-centric views to youth infor- mation behavior, scholars have ab- stracted the process of information seeking, rather than seeing how it is en- twined with activity, or the processes of doing and being in the world, including meaning making. A number of research- ers in LIS have explored out-of-school information seeking and use, particularly</page><page sequence="6">Tip of the Iceberg: Meaning, Identity, and Literacy in Preteen Virtual Worlds 231 how information behavior in older chil- dren and teens supports the developing social self (e.g. Agosto &amp; Hughes-Hassell, 2006; Latrobe &amp; Havener, 1997; Shenton &amp; Dixon, 2003). Information seeking among youth, how- ever, has not been situated as a social practice. Recent research (Fisher, Marcoux, Meyers &amp; Landry, 2007; Meyers, Fisher, &amp; Marcoux, 2007; 2009) on preteen everyday life information be- havior suggests that information seeking and problem solving are embedded in a wide range of social practices, including activities at home, school, public social spaces, and online. This notion of exam- ining social practices as information be- havior is an emergent approach in LIS, but one which is consistent with new ways of looking at everyday experiences in a range of cognate fields, including communication and media studies, and the learning sciences. To address this gap in the area of youth information behavior, I propose a four-part framework for analyzing pre- teen SVEs. These four parts represent themes that have emerged in the existing scholarship in cognate disciplines, and nascent empirical research about the vir- tual worlds themselves. Specifically, preteen SVEs exist as: (1) an identity space; (2) a new literacy; (3) a prob- lem-solving context; and (4) a commu- nity. These four interconnected parts suggest the complexity of the phenome- non, and demand a multi-dimensional ap- proach to the continuing study of these technologies and the practices emerging within and around them. I will elaborate briefly on each of these four points, and present a case example to illustrate how this framework may be applied. S VE as Identity Space We express ourselves by how we dress, what car we drive, or the type of house we live in. Through participation in virtual worlds, children are given an introduc- tion to the development of a persona, a unique identity that reflects their grow- ing sense of self. The front page for a pop- ular teen space, Gaia (http://www. gaiaonline.com) suggests: Mini You. Your avatar can be as unique as you are. Make a little clone of your real-self, or create a crazy style you could never pull off in the real world. You're limited only by your imagination and your Gaia Gold [virtual currency]. While Gaia is designed for teens, this sentiment is evident in the spaces de- signed for younger children as well. The flexibility to create a personal (and dis- posable) online style that mimics or con- tradicts the physical self permits children the opportunity for low-stakes identity play. This projection of the real self in virtual space has tremendous potential for learning, and could be a building block in the constructing of the social self. As an area of research, it is unclear how virtual and physical identities inter- act, especially in young children, and whether such identity play can alter pro-social development. Nor is it clear how the augmented capacities or altered appearances of avatars would affect no- tions of authority, credibility, trust, and social costs in instances of peer information sharing. S VE as a New Literacy As children engage with virtual spaces, they participate in a discourse commu- nity. Some aspects of this discourse are generalizable to other experiences (both in the real world and in other online spaces), and some aspects are specific to a given virtual space. Logging in, creat- ing an online identity, chatting, and shar- ing a profile with others are skills and "literacies" that transfer across several applications. Other more specific dis- course elements, such as "tipping the ice- berg" are specific to a given virtual context (see below). Knobel and</page><page sequence="7">232 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE Lankshear (2006) suggest that a new lit- eracy requires new "technical stuff and new "ethos stuff." The new technical stuff in preteen SVEs is the ability for preteens and younger children to engage with websites and each other in novel ways, from social networking and chat to creating and manipulating customizable avatars. While these technologies have been around for some time, placing them in the hands of children at a developmen- tally appropriate level is an important leap forward. The new "ethos stuff" is the manner in which children engage with these spaces, specifically moving from knowledge consumers (as in the early web - decoding the text of others) to knowledge producers (demonstrating ex- pertise through participatory, distrib- uted, and collaborative means). Children are the experts in these spaces, even if the space is created and moderated by adults. This notion of participation in virtual space as a new literacy is not meant to dis- count existing conceptions of literacy (reading and information seeking); rather, it is meant to be additive and com- plementary. The link between this new literacy and older literacies requires fur- ther examination, particularly as educators address how technology use potentially reinforces and exacerbates existing gaps in decoding and problem solving among young people (Gee, 2008b). S VE as a Learning and Problem Solving Context People continually engage in informa- tion problem solving - identifying needs, selecting sources, determining credibility and relevance, and making de- cisions by synthesis or drawing conclu- sions. Information problem solving is particularly relevant in virtual environ- ments where new tools provide users with novel ways to use, interpret, and share information. There are very few in- structions in many of these spaces; chil- dren often immerse themselves in the space and begin solving in-world issues of navigation, personalization, and com- munication right away. As a child's com- fort level with the world increases, the emphasis changes from solving problems about being in the virtual world (how do I do that?) to solving everyday problems in the world (what homework do we have in math?). Novice users ask for directions; experienced users engage with each other using the world as a mediating tool. There is evidence of a wide range of prob- lem solving in these spaces. What merits further exploration is the balance be- tween these two key types of problems: problems related to the world itself, and unrelated problems that are tackled in-world. SVE as a Community Virtual spaces offer synchronous in- teraction within the world: opportuni- ties to play and socialize with others, as well as points of asynchronous interac- tion online through fan sites, blogs, and YouTube videos. What emerges is a sense of community, a membership in a larger enterprise in which other children participate. In many ways, the children in CP, Webkinz, and other SVEs become a community of practice, one which shapes their understanding of the online world, and their identity as a member of that world. Furthermore, there are op- portunities to demonstrate expertise and status in these online companion sites. Beyond the plethora of "hacks" and "cheats" identified by users, websites offer instruction and insight from expe- rienced members, detailed tutorials on how to earn rewards, and techniques that novices can employ to improve their standing in the community. Online com- munities have been studied by a number of scholars (Steinkuehler, 2008; Wenger, White &amp; Smith, 2009). How youth communities differ from those of adults, or how these communities, and</page><page sequence="8">Tip of the Iceberg: Meaning, Identity, and Literacy in Preteen Virtual Worlds 233 youth participation in them, will evolve is still unknown. Each one of these four framework ele- ments supports research opportunities. Taken together, the four elements represent a holistic approach that would describe the multidimensional, multi-stakeholder is- sues raised by preteen SVEs. As an exam- ple of how a general understanding of these spaces might be applied to the analysis of a specific phenomenon, the case below illus- trates the emergence and response to an on- line même in the SVE Club Penguin. An online même is a concept that spreads quickly from person to person through on- line spaces and other media (see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_(Inter net)). The phenomenon examined in the example most strongly draws on the last two framework elements (problem solving and community), but aspects of the other two elements are present as well. Case Example: Tipping the Iceberg As CP was developing its reputation and participant base in 2006, an online même emerged surrounding one particu- lar facet of the virtual world. Penguins began gathering in large numbers on the iceberg a short distance from the other buildings and activity spaces of the CP village in an attempt to "tip it," or get the ice to flip over. It is unclear how this même began, but it became the source of considerable activity, both inside and outside the virtual space. Rumors circu- lated about prizes and penalties associ- ated with this task. Although a brief mention of tipping the iceberg was made on the official CP webpage, the site cre- ators playfully refused to clarify whether or not this could be accomplished, allow- ing the rumor to proliferate. While there is no convincing evidence that the ice- berg was in fact "tipped" or even "tippable," this activity became the focus of considerable information seeking, writing, video and image creating. In short, tipping the iceberg became an in- formation problem that engaged children in various information consumption, assessment, and production activities. A critical component of this même was the development and assessment of vari- ous systems for getting the ice to tip. Children created and tested hypotheses, nearly all of which involved organizing a critical mass of other penguins to partici- pate in the form of "tipping parties." The most commonly observed strategy was physical: clustering penguins on one side of the iceberg, as it was felt based on real world principles of physics, that massing avatars at a single point might trigger the tip. Other strategies ranged from the magical - having all penguins change to the same color, or dance a particular way - to the mechanical - obtaining spe- cific tools such as a drill to facilitate sink- ing or destabilizing the iceberg. In each of these instances, children were attempt- ing to uncover the rules of the system, often comparing the digital to the physical world for inspiration. The attempts to tip the iceberg were part of a community effort, not just in the hypothesis testing in the virtual space, but also in the flourishing digital conver- sation in the preteen blogosphere that supported these attempts. Thousands of users - children and adults - recorded questions and responses on Yahoo! An- swers and other online reference services seeking more information. They wrote of this activity in terms of obsession and ur- gency, and with generous use of the ex- clamation mark. On websites and blogs, children documented their ideas, pre- sented counter-proposals and evidence, and created sophisticated movies and tu- torials to illustrate their efforts (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nll USL-ezi4). The community effort pro- vided opportunities for children to dem- onstrate their expertise and represent their intellectual and social passions. While tipping the iceberg is no longer in vogue, it remains part of the mystique of the SVE, and trace evidence of children' s</page><page sequence="9">234 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE efforts to solve this problem litter the Web. The transformation of information consumers into knowledge builders is a significant step. Preteens appear capable of using digital tools and environments to participate in communities of interest and learning, as well as become experts in their areas of passion. SVEs are not just play spaces, but the focal point of a great deal of information work that is rarely privileged or understood as acts of liter- acy. The extent to which children partici- pate in virtual worlds suggests that it is not a passing fad, but may instead expose new ways of teaching them to work col- laboratively and creatively. Rather than blocking these sites, educators should look for ways to leverage their learning and problem solving aspects, examine how they motivate information seeking and use, and how they provide vital agency to children to take charge of their own learning. A Research Agenda for Preteen SVEs Given the proliferation of sites in this genre, and the potential for these sites as learning and meaning making environ- ments, additional research is needed. This article documents the initial foray into this space as part of a research pro- ject to explore the complex social and technical aspects of how children use these worlds, how adult stakeholders and institutions affect these interactions, and how different value propositions are manifest in immersive virtual environ- ments. The guiding questions for this re- search include: How do preteens construct meaning, authority, identity, and expertise in virtual space? How do online social networks affect the infor- mation seeking and sharing practices of preteens? More broadly, how will grow- ing up in virtual space affect our notion of what it means to be "literate" in the 21st Century? Rooted in a sociocultural stance, this research uses a cognitive ethnographic approach (Hutchin, 1995) and the devel- opmental theory of Vygotsky (1978) to inform both methods and analysis. Cog- nitive ethnography, which draws on an- thropological techniques and prolonged engagement, is used to develop an under- standing of a particular community of us- ers, in this case preteens in virtual worlds, and then applies this understanding to ep- isodic activities through micro-analysis. Traditional ethnographic approaches de- scribe the knowledge of a particular com- munity, whereas cognitive ethnography describes how members of a particular community construct and use knowledge in everyday activities. Specifically, this research project will engage with these virtual spaces through extended partici- pant observation, group and individual interviews with multiple stakeholders, activity diaries, and self-reported behavior tracking. Future work will include: (1) a field based investigation gathering institu- tional, parent, and child perceptions of preteen virtual worlds based on this con- ceptual work; (2) longitudinal data col- lection with preteen children interacting with virtual worlds; and (3) developing design criteria and recommendations for software developers, interaction design- ers, youth service providers, and parents concerned with the long-term influence of virtual worlds on preteen social and moral development. A conceptual analy- sis of how value propositions manifest in these spaces using a critical comparison technique informed by Value Sensitive Design (Nathan, et al., 2008) is already underway. Conclusion Immersive virtual technologies are no longer restricted to science fiction stories or exotic research labs: they are available to a growing number of children and adults on their desktop computers via the</page><page sequence="10">Tip of the Iceberg: Meaning, Identity, and Literacy in Preteen Virtual Worlds 235 Internet. SVEs or, as Castronova (2003) calls them, "synthetic worlds" offer tre- mendous potential for learning, creativ- ity, collaboration, and problem solving. We are moving into an age marked by new styles of interaction and communi- cation, where the distinction between "play" and "learning" may be altogether meaningless. LIS has been slow to ac- knowledge the complex information be- havior embedded in games, social networks, and virtual contexts beyond traditional search and retrieval. Under- standing how preteens use virtual worlds as problem solving and learning spaces will contribute to our growing knowl- edge of how social information practices develop in young people. This knowl- edge is of critical concern to parents, edu- cators, caregivers, librarians, and others who mediate the real and virtual worlds of preteens. Furthermore, the findings may be used in design requirements for alternate information retrieval tools for young people, as suggested by Beheshti, Bowler, Large, and Nesset (2005). SVEs offer a rich context for the development of socially mediated information prac- tices. As the obstacles to participation lessen, grasping the implications of the use SVEs by this and future generations is critical.
