<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marduk in Heaven By Francesca Rochberg (Riverside CA) To adapt a phrase from King Sennacherib, Hermann Hunger's work on cuneiform astronomical and astrological texts is a contribution without a rival. His tireless and Singular efforts in the publication of translitérations, trans lations, dating and interprétation of late Babylonian non-mathematical astro nomical texts, the so-called Diaries and related materials, have given this and future générations of cuneiformists who do not specialize in the astronomical corpora, as well as historians of science, and historians of antiquity in général access to these rieh and important sources. Indeed he has made a habit of providing the rest of us with reliable éditions of some of the most difficult texts, from the colophons of astronomical, magical, literary, legal, historical, médical, mathematical, and divination texts to the astrological reports to Assyrian kings and late non-tabular astronomical texts from Uruk, to name only a few. The présent paper on the astral nature of the king of the gods, Marduk, is humbly presented to „HeHu" with not so subtle metaphoric intent. The opening of Enùma üXsTablet V deals with the order and regularity of the appearance of heavenly bodies, describing features of the heavens as the work of Marduk. Marduk arranged the stars into constellations, the „images" of the gods themselves. By means of the fîxed stars he organized the year into twelve months, marked by the (heliacal) risings of three stars in each month in their speeified „paths."1 These paths, named for Anu, Enlil, and Ea, were used in early Babylonian astronomical texts such as MUL.APIN, the Astrolabes, and their derivatives as a reference system for the positions of stars and constellations with respect to the horizon. The acrostic hymn to Marduk refers to the création of the paths, saying that „in the east and west he (Marduk) set up constellations, gave them roads and passages [,..].2 The god created the zenith, the moon and the month from the lunar phases, designated as the new moon crescent, the half-moon on the seventh day, füll moon on the fifteenth day (opposition), and the second half of the moon as the reverse of the first. The relation between the moon and sun was duly noted: „At the day of di[sappeara]nce, approach the sun's course, on the [...] of the thirtieth day, you shall be in conjunction with the sun a second time."3 Marduk was the creator of the heavenly domain and all that was visible in it, but he was also a member of it, shining as Jupiter (or Mercury). Unlike some deities, such as Inanna/Istar, who already in the third millen 1 Foster, Before the Muses: An Anthology of Akkadian Literature (Bethesda, Mary land: CDL Press, 1993), p.378, EnElV 3-4. 2 SAA 3 No.2 rev. 9. 3 Foster, Muses, p.379, EnElV 21-22.</page><page sequence="2">434 F. Rochberg nium was seen in astral form as the planet Venus,4 the existence of Marduk as a deity predates his astralization as Jupiter. Of his origins not much is known. Marduk's astral nature seems to have stemmed from the later development of his cult that accompanied the ascendancy of the State of Babylonia. The association of Marduk with the already astral Sulpae (=Jupiter?) may rest on their shared identity as warriors. Indeed both bear relation to the heroic figure of the god Ninurta.5 While Sulpae seems to have held a relatively modest position in the Sumerian panthéon, it is tempting to view Marduk's identifica tion with him as a conscious co-opting of a heroic and astral figure to add to the sublime nature of the head of the Babylonian panthéon. The god Sulpae „Brilliant Youth" is found in Sumerian texts as early as Fara and as late as Ur III and Old Babylonian. His astral aspect is traceable to the Old Babylonian period (at least),6 although his identification specifically as Jupiter in these early references is not at all clear. Sulpae's epithets convey his attributes as a radiant god of awe-inspiring splendor (sa puluhtu milamml nasû „who bears awe-inspiring splendor"7) and as „the heroic one" (däpinu). Later references in omen texts to Sulpae, written with the determinatives dingir and mul, all concern the planet Jupiter.8 Sulpae was also identified with Däpinu in the lexical list Antagal,9 and in another bilingual text is character ized by the phrase ud al.tar, interpreted as ümu däpinu „overwhelming spirit."10 Däpinu (d/mulUD.AL.TAR) occurs as the name of Jupiter, according to one omen, when the planet is on the western horizon.11 The astral manifestation of the god Marduk was primarily Jupiter, but secondarily also Mercury (see below). Jupiter's name in celestial omen texts or astronomical sources outside those of the late Babylonian astronomy is most often d/muiSAG. ME.GAR, whose meaning and even pronunciation are unknown.

Late astronomical texts use the name mulBABBAR, which is not attested earlier. One astrological report suggests that some of the various names for the „the star of Marduk" (Sulpae, SAG.ME.GAR, and Nëberu) correspond to différent appearances of the planet with respect to the horizon, Sulpae being its name when Jupiter rises, SAG.ME.GAR when it has risen 1 bêru, Nëberu when on (or near) the meridian.12 This is certainly not applied consistently, as we see the name dSulpae used in an enumeration of the seven planets instead of SAG.ME.GAR without any such reference to a particular appearance of the planet.13 When the planetaiy manifestation of Marduk appeared in the middle of the sky, he was called ''''""'Nëberu „the Ford" or „Crossing Point."14 But the implication of the name d/mulNëberu for being „in the middle" need not always be with respect to a position in the sky, because it occurs as the 7th name in the text listing the names of Jupiter in the twelve months of the year, i.e., midway through the year in the month of the autumnal equinox.15 mulNëberu is also found as a name of Jupiter without reference to a position in the middle of the sky, as in „If Nëberu rises and the gods get peace ...."16 The practice of Decknamen is widespread in Assyro-Babylonian astrologi cal literature. The constellation dGAM = gamlu „the Crook" = Auriga is used as such a code-name for Jupiter. The compilation of omens in the astrological reports to explain observed phenomena show this to be the case, for example when omens for Jupiter are collected and include in the same group protases for SAG.ME.GAR and for dGAM.17 mulGAM is found in the list of the names 18 of Jupiter in the twelve months of the year as the planet's name in month IX. This métonymie association is based on the gamlu as an instrument of Marduk, the „weapon in the hand of Marduk." 9 The use of the star name MUL.LUGAL/dSarru „the king," is also a Substitute for Marduk as Jupiter, for obvious reasons.20 12 SAA 8 No.147: 7-rev.l. 13 See Ulla Koch-Westenholz, Mesopotamian Astrology: An Introduction to Babylonian and Assyrian Celestial Divination (Copenhagen: The Carsten Niebuhr Institute of Near Eastern Studies, 1995), p.200 Appendix B, line 242 (DI). 14 See CAD s.v. nëberu mng 3a, and the discussion of the identification of Nëberu in J.

Rochberg Marduk was also identified with the closest planet to the sun, Mercury, which may well explain the writing of Marduk's name AMAR.UTU „calf of the sun."2 Here one would assume an awareness that Mercury was never very far from the sun and was consequently visible only as an evening or morning star near the horizon around sunrise or sunset. The identification of Marduk's star with Mercury is found in Neo-Assyrian reports: „The star of Marduk, Mercury, is going beyond its (normal) position and ascends," and „If the star of Marduk becomes visible at the beginning of the year: that year his furrow will prosper. (This means) Mercury becomes visible in Nisan."22 A commen tary to EAE 56 explains „if a planet becomes visible in Nisannu" (this refers to) Jupiter, variant: Mercury." The dual association of Jupiter and Mercury with Marduk may have more to do with mythological interrelations at play than with any astronomical justification. Mercury was more often associated with Ninurta, and being less luminous and more difficult to see, it was attached to unfortunate omens, of flood and death, perhaps because of the destructive character of its mytho logical identity in Ninurta. But Ninurta, the warrior son of the Sumerian storm deity Enlil, automatically cornes into relation with Marduk through the mythology constructed for Marduk as the new warrior Creator, the new Enlil. Enlil's replacement by Marduk is canonized in Enüma Elis, which expresses this in a number of ways, for example in his weaponry of winds, but most explicitly in the litany of the fifty names of Marduk, an allusion to Enlil's Deckname d50. The association of the divine warrior figures of Ninurta and Marduk, and the relation each one had to the god Sulpae, was underpinned by various Strands of a mythological background for their astral associations and acted to bring the two planets Jupiter and Mercury together with the god Marduk. By means of mythological constructs the divine was projected onto the Mesopotamian heavens. In the case of Marduk's planets, Jupiter and Mercury, in their guise as Nëberu, it is conceivable that the „crossing point" was a counterpart or astral représentation of the mythological significance of Marduk as „the king who divided the gods,"24 an epithet referring to his division of the 600 Anunna gods into heavenly and netherworld deities.

Marduk was the central deity, whose „place" lay at the central point of the cosmos where one crossed from heaven to earth. Fulfilling this role in the visible heaven were points such as the midpoint on the horizon due east where Mercury could be seen, or high on the meridian where Jupiter could be seen. Such visual counterparts to the idea of the crossing point could have given rise to the star name Nëberu: Nëberu shall hold the passage of heaven and earth, So they shall not cross above and below without heeding him, Nëberu is his star which he made visible in the skies, It shall hold the point of turning around, they shall look upon him, Saying, „He who crossed back and forth, without resting, in the midst of Tiamat, Nëberu („Crossing") shall be his name, who holds the position in its midst.26 The name Nëberu for the planetary embodiment of Marduk, usually as Jupiter, occurs in celestial diviners' reports, such as „If the moon is sur rounded by a halo and SAG.ME.GAR stands in it; If the moon is surrounded by a halo, and Nëberu stands in it."27 In the poetic context of Assurbanipal's acrostic hymn to Marduk and Zarpanitu the god's name Engisgalanna „lord of the heavenly station" occurs in broken context, but has to do with the positions of the Anunnaki (manzäzi 'ViOO).28 The term manzäzu has a specific celestial connotation,29 and perhaps this relates to Marduk's division of the Anunna gods in Enüma Elis VI 39, mentioned above. This name also appears in a Neo-Assyrian scholar's report explaining the omen protasis „If Engisgalanna becomes bright" as referring to Jupiter. Assurbanipal's hymn to Marduk and Zarpanitu praises the god's exalted position throughout the cosmos, in the heavens as well as on earth, including, in the description of his capacities, his manifestation as the planet: Your shining name is Jupiter (dSAG.ME.GAR), the first-ranking god, the foremost of the foremost, the highest god, who [...], 25 EnElVl 78. 26 EnEl VII 124-129, translation Foster, Muses, p.399, but note that Nëberu is written there with the divine determinative. EnElV 6, which introduces Nëberu as marking by virtue of its central position the relationships among stars, Koch in „Der Mardukstem," argued must be located on the horizon and for this reason he identifies Nëberu with the planet Mercury. 27 SAA 8 No. 147:3 and 5. 28 See SAA 3 No.2:43. 29 See CAD s.v. manzâzu mng 5.</page><page sequence="6">438 F. Rochberg who at his rising makes manifest a sign, [...] the Ple[iades ].30 In a version of Marduk's theomachy différent from that in Enûma Elis, the god does battle against Anu. The scene of conflict with the sky-god is, of course, heaven, so Orion, the figure of the True Shepherd of Anu, and therefore the enemy of Marduk, is spattered with the blood of Anu: When Marduk got up and ascended behind Orion, Ea stood behind him, and having g[irt] his loins and defeated Orion, Bel recited the incantation of Ea and consigned him to the Anunnaki.31 A divine allegory is told here, set in heaven, in which the characters are gods, and constellations are personified in figures such as the constellation True Shepherd of Anu (Orion). This shows that divine stories through their cosmic mise-en-scène could be symbolized by celestial bodies. The references to Marduk's theomachy in the Assyrian cuit were useful for their symbolism of kingly power. In a commentary to the Assyrian cultic calendar,32 oblique refer ence to Enûma Elis can be read in the passage where Marduk vanquishes his enemies and casts Qingu and his sons from the roof in the form of a bull and rams, their blood being ritually represented in the act of casting oil and honey into the gutter (line 4). Mention is also made of Marduk's vanquishing of Anu and the evil Sibitti (Pleiades), sons of Enmesara. The 19th day is there assigned to „the day the king defeated Anu, the day King Marduk defeated Anu." Both the mythological arrow of Ninurta (sukûdu) and that of Marduk {mulmullu) were given astral form as Sirius and the Pleiades respectively. The Astrolabe's identification of the month of Ningirsu with the Pleiades,33 echoes the personification of these stars as gods of war carrying bow and arrow, attested to in an inscription of Esarhaddon as well as in the Epie of Erra.34 Hymn and prayer texts address Ninurta as the star Sirius, calling him „tireless arrow" and the god „who is Sirius (millKAK.SI.SÂ) in heaven,"35 and the identi fication of the star with the god gives rise to the following obvious anthropo morphism: When the stars rise, [your] features are shining [like] the sun, 30 SAA 3 No.2:41-42. 31 SAA 3 No.38, for rites in the Istar temple at Arbil where various objects are identified as gods, see lines 24-27. 32 SAA 3 No.40. 33 Astrolabe Β, KAV 218 A I 12f and 19, see Amar Annus, The God Ninurta in the mythology and royal ideology of ancient Mesopotamia (Helsinki, Finland, Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, State Archives of Assyria Studies, vol.14,2002), p.135. 34 R.

The weaponry of Marduk appears in another astral manifestation, this time of Istar, symbolized as Marduk's bow.37 In Tablet VI of Enüma Elis the identity of Marduk's bow is made explicit when Anu raises it up, kisses it and calls it his daughter, and finally dubs it „Bow Star," making it visible in heaven.38 It is well known that all celestial bodies, stars, constellations, and planets were members of the category mul „star." The planets were further distin guished by the term bibbu, a sheep of some kind, on the analogy that their movements are not fixed in relation to one another as are the fixed stars because, as it is explained in MUL.APIN, they „keep changing their positions."39 However, MUL.APIN's définition of the planets is not limited to this physical feature, as the fuller context shows them also to be gods who should receive offerings when they „become visible": [These (SAG.ME.GAR/Jupiter, Dilibat/Venus, Sihu sa Ninurta/Mercury, Salbatänu/Mars, Kajamänu/Saturn, also called Scales or the stars of the sun) are the gods who] keep changing their positions and their glow [and] touch [the stars of the sky]; on the day their stars become visible, [their r/snus 0 ...] where they become visible, and the wind that blows; on the day they become visible, you présent offerings to them.41 This aspect of the conception of the celestial bodies as visible gods to whom one prayed and made offerings is complemented by the function of their celestial appearances as omens. In the reports from scholars to the Sargonid kings, when blessings to the king are offered and the names of celestial bodies are given, they are also referred to explicitly as gods: „Assur, Sin, Samas, Adad, Nusku, Jupiter (called Sagmegar), Venus (called Dilbat), Marduk, [Zarpanitu], Nabû, Tasmetum, Saturn (called dUDU.IDIM.GUD.UD) Lady [of Nineveh],.... the great gods of heaven and earth, the gods dwelling in 36 Ibid., lines 14-16.. 37 EnEllV-35. 38 EnEIWM-90. 39 MUL.APIN II i 8, see Hunger-Pingree, MUL.APIN, p.71; Erica Reiner, Astral Magic in Babylonia (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, TAPS 85, 1995), p.7 note 22 notes that doubt has been cast on the reading (on semantic grounds) of UDU.BAD as UDU.IDIM „wild sheep." Horowitz, argues for retaining the reading „wild sheep," see Wayne Horowitz, Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography (Winona Lake, Indiana : Eisenbrauns, Mesopotamian Civilizations vol. 8,1998), p.153 note 3. 40 The word risnu occurs here in a différent sense from its meaning „soaking, bathing." In the commentary to MUL.APIN II i 27, Hunger suggests that it might be a synonym for some kind of visible property such as a brilliance or luminosity. 41 MUL.APIN.

Rochberg Assyria, [the gods] dwelling in Akkad, and all the gods of the world ...."42 The use of divine names, such as Marduk for Jupiter, points to a concep tion of the celestial bodies as images of gods, manifesting their agency in the physical world. With the exception of the non-anthropomorphic „crossing point" Nëberu, Jupiter's other names are appropriate to the anthropomorphic conception of a heroic god. Although we do not know the dérivation of the name SAG.ME.GAR, even this name reflects an anthropomorphic notion of Jupiter as an embodiment of a god, as explained in a scholastic list where SAG.ME.GAR, is the „bearer of signs to the inhabited world." According to the opening lines of Enüma ElisTsb\&amp;X V 1-2, celestial bodies represented physical counterparts to the gods: „He (Marduk) created the stations for the great gods, setting up the stars, their (the great gods') like nesses, as constellations."43 The invocation of the constellation Ursa Major in a prayer for an ominous dream illustrâtes this idea in a manner reminiscent of the identification of the body parts of one god with other gods viewed as lesser powers.44 The prayer describes features of the constellation as représentations of a number of deities: „O Wagon Star, heavenly wagon! Whose yoke is Ninurta, whose pole is Marduk, whose side-pieces are the two heavenly daughters of Anu. The heavenly domain, whether it was viewed as the création of Marduk or given some other mythological etiology, became the focus of observational attention. Because the phenomena were interprétable as signs of divine will, the observation of what occurred above was signifîcant for what would happen below. For this practice, an observational language developed to describe the phenomena empirically. The descriptions of the appearances of celestial bodies were compiled as omens in the sériés Enùma Anu Enlil, which together with a variety of commentaries and excerpts formed the basic reference work quoted by the Neo-Assyrian scholars in their letters and reports to the Sargonid kings. As already noted, the language of the omen protases, despite their empirical character, is replete with metaphor and personification. Many phenomena are in fact described by means of personifications (the sky shouts, planets confront each other, wear crowns and clothing, carry radiance, have anthropomorphic physical attributes, e.g., a head, eyes, a beard). In keeping with such personifications, Jupiter was one of the principal benefic planets. A Late Babylonian astrological text enumerates the planets and their signs, beginning with Jupiter, calling its sign „favorable" (salämu). Where Jupiter is 42 SAA10 No.197: 7-19, p.160. 43 Note also the use of the word tamsllu in the genealogy of the gods in EnEl 1:16 to define the relation between Anu and Ea: (First Ansar made his child Anu his match), „then Anu generated Ea, his likeness ( tamsilasu)." 44 For example in the hymn to Ninurta KAR 102, see Annus, The GodNinurta, Appen dix 1, p.205-6 and parallels, KAR 328 rev. and STT 118. 45 STT 73:71-73, see Reiner, Astral Magic, p.71.</page><page sequence="9">Marduk in Heaven 441 the object of astronomical considération, the attribution of a benefic character is reflected in the order in which Jupiter (designated either as muiSAG.ME.GAR or mulBABBAR) is listed among other planets, i.e., as the first benefic with Venus and Mercury.46 The name mulUD (BABBAR), whether it stemmed from an abbreviated form of UD.ALTAR/Däpinu, or simply meant „shining/ bright/white star," could have denoted the planet's appearance as well as the divine radiance of Marduk of which the planet was a „likeness," and of course the luminosity of the god/planet is evoked in Enüma Eli§s 9th name of Marduk, Namru („Bright One") „the shining god who illumines our ways."47 It may seem as though the religious and mythological dimension of Meso potamian celestial science has little to do with the empirical. Indeed, the foregoing discussion may once have been considered to deal with the essence of the non-empirical. But the past génération of work in the sociology of science and the sociology of scientific knowledge has shown convincingly, to my mind, that science is a product of the interaction between observer and experienced world. As this interaction is culturally determined, it becomes difficult to separate out an empirical language that refers only to the external „real" world and a non-empirical one that refers to the internal culturally conditioned response to the external world. In fact, from this point of view, the line between external and internal begins to fade and appear artificial. The shift brought about by the sociology of science since the 1970's worked to more closely integrate nature into human culture in our thinking about science and its history. Thomas Kuhn in a 1989 panel on „the Natural and the Human Sciences,"48 outlined the way in which he was inclined to draw the line, or not draw a line, between the human and the natural sciences. What he argued against there was the notion of the uniformity of nature, i.e., that cultural relativism can apply to human behavior but not natural phenomena. He did not see that natural phenomena were „the same for all cultures"49 and remained unconvinced by the argument that because nature stands apart from human culture, existing independently from our actions and our knowing, that its phenomena are necessarily or categorically unaffected by culture. He suggested that not only are concepts („of the natural or social world") „the possession of 46 See F.

Rochberg communities (cultures or subcultures)," but social concepts as well as concepts of the natural world „shape the world to which they are applied."50 Kuhn said, for example, „the heavens of the Greeks were irreducibly différent from ours."51 It is plain that the heavens of the Assyrians and Babylonians were equally „irreducibly différent." This certainly raises questions of the relation of scientific knowledge to the „reality" observed or experienced by the observer, and indeed, whether observers subscribing to différent théories in fact ,,see" différent phenomena in the same „world." N.R. Hanson famously questioned whether observers subscribing to différent théories in fact „see" différent phenomena in the same „world," his most apposite example being the question of whether Kepler, who regarded the sun as fixed and the earth as moving, and Tycho, who regarded the sun as moving and the earth as fixed, „see" the same thing in the east at dawn when the sun rises.52 With such questions about the nature of empirical knowledge the evidence for the identity of planets with gods in ancient Mesopotamia takes on another dimension beyond simply a system of scholastic corrélations between celestial bodies and gods. It seems to me to be an essential part of how the ancients saw the phenomena. 50 Ibid., p.219. 51 Ibid., p.220. 52 Norwood Russell Hanson, Pattems of Discovery : an Inquiry into the Conceptual Foundatons of Science (Cambridge and New York : Cambridge University Press, 1969), p.5.</page></plain_text>
