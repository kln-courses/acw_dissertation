<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paws to Reflect: Ancients and Moderns on the Religious Sensibilities of Animals Stephen T. Newmyer In his article, The Greek Anthropocentric View of Man', Robert Rene han traces the development in Greek intellectual history of the idea that man is a rational animal (??(pov Xoyix?v) who differs from other animals most strikingly in his capacity for intellectual activity.1 Renehan ob serves that this concept has become so widely accepted in Western cul ture that one no longer realizes that it is a specifically Greek invention, al though the dichotomy which results from the idea has, in Renehan's view, "... scarcely any rival as a characteristically Greek concept".2 The effect of this peculiarly Greek idea was to relegate non-human animals to a position forever below that occupied by human beings, giving birth to a condescending attitude toward other species still current today among scientists, philosophers and theologians. One of the most characteristic forms in which this concept of human uniqueness manifested itself in ancient sources was what Renehan terms the "man alone of animals" topos, whereby writers sought to isolate those mental activities which humans perform more effectively than do other species, but which was expanded to include anatomical, physiologi cal and behavioral characteristics which were likewise judged to be unique to humans. An almost bewildering array of such characteristics can be isolated in Greek writers, some of which seem substantive while others are likely to strike the modern reader as trivial and farfetched. Those which distinguish the various aspects of the mental superiority of humans over animals form perhaps the majority of instances. The earliest occurrence of the topos may be Hesiod's assertion (Op. 278) that only man i. R. Renehan, 'The Greek Anthropocentric View of Man', Harv. Stud. Class. Philol. 85,1981, pp. 239-259. The phrase ?,cpov Xoyixov applied to human beings appears to be post Aristotelian, and may be a Stoic invention, although its origins are in doubt. It is found frequently in the earlier Christian writers. For references on the phrase in classical sour ces, see Renehan, pp. 239-242. 2. Renehan, art. cit. p. 240.</page><page sequence="2">112 Stephen T. Newmyer has an understanding of justice since Zeus did not plant the concept in ani mals (ejrei ov olxt] eoxt ?iex' avxolc,). Not surprisingly, the notion of man's mental superiority proved especially appealing to Greek philosophers. Aristotle, for example, maintained that, while other animals may mani fest such traits as shyness, pride or affection, only man is a deliberative an imal (HA 488b 24-25, ?ouXeimxov ?? ?l?vov avOocoji?c ?oxi x?bv ?cpcov). In an analogous formulation in De partibus animalium, the philosopher stressed that, while other animals may possess locomotion, only humans possess intellect (PA 641B 8-9, vn?Qx^i r\ cpo?? xai ?v ?x??oi?; xarv ?cpcov ?ia voia ?? otj?evi). The most frequently voiced claim for man's uniqueness in Greek philosophical thought is his ability to produce meaningful speech that can communicate knowledge and ethical values, a position clearly articulated by Aristotle (Pol. 1253a 10-19, X?yov ?? ji?vov avdooojto? e/ei xcov ?cpcov... xo?xo y?o jtqo? x?XXa t,(ba xo?? ?vfjQCDjtoi?; ??iov, x? ?iovov ?yaOoD xai xaxoD xai ?ixaiou xai xcov aXX v aicrf}r|?iv ?xeiv).3 In some cases, unique anatomical features in human beings were taken as evidence of their superior intellectual powers. The possession of hands, for example, was cited as proof of man's special place in creation, as is seen in Aristotle's reference to a statement by his Presocratic prede cessor Anaxagoras (PA 687a 8-9), 'Ava^ayOQa? ?lev ovv qpnoi ?i? x? %??Qa? ?xeiv cpQovi?iobxaxov e?vai x v ??qxov ?vdocDJtov. Similarly, man's upright posture was frequently mentioned, particularly by medical writers, as an indication of man's uniquely advanced anatomical design. Galen more than once drew attention to this human feature, as in his treatise De usu partium (3, 2), ?cjO?? ?? ?l?voc ?cpoov ?ji?vxoov ? avdocDJto?. While upright posture and the possession of hands might justly be considered advanta geous traits, some ancient claims of human anatomical uniqueness deal with what would seem to be somewhat less consequential factors.

Sorabji makes the interesting observation on the entire ancient effort to isolate those characteristics that distinguish man from other animals, p. 93, "My own impression on attempts to draw a boundary between humans and animals is that it is very easy to find things well beyond the compass of animals, like advanced mathema tics, but very difficult to find the supposed border itself.</page><page sequence="3">Ancients and Moderns on the Religious Sensibilities of Animals 113 might be cited to suggest the ingenuity of ancient writers. Plato observed that only humans have a sense of rhythm (Leg. 653E-654A), while Philo (De animalibus 49) noted that only humans engage in sexual activity at all times of year, and Aristotle claimed that only man can count (Top. 142b 26).4 Xenophon (Hier. 7, 3) maintained that only man seeks glory, xcd y?? ?xoi ?oxet... xo?rrcp ?iacp?Qeiv ?vf]fj xc?v a?Aoov t/poov xcp xijif]? ?p?yecr?m. Many emotional states were likewise claimed by one ancient authority or another to be unique to humans, including grief, joy, anger, aggression and anxiety5. From among the many ingenious forms in which this topos appears, Renehan singles out one claim of man's uniqueness as particularly weighty, "The most awesome claim in this 'man alone of animals' series is that man alone is, in one sense or other, divine".6 This manifestation of the topos that constitutes the subject of Renehan's article has had perhaps 4- It is interesting to note that some cognitive ethologists, those biologists who spe cialize in the study of animal behavior in natural settings rather than in the controlled and artificial conditions of laboratories, have pointed out that evidence exists suggesting that some animals can count, or at least have an understanding of the concepts of "more" and "less". L. J. Rogers, Minds of Their Own: Thinking and Awareness in Animals, Boulder 1997, pp. 70-71, notes that pigeons have been shown to be able to distinguish one from two, and to recognize, with somewhat less accuracy, groups from three to eight. The mechanism that enables pigeons to accomplish this, Rogers admits, is not yet under stood. More recently, M. D. H?user, Wild Minds: What Animals Really Think, New York 2000, pp. 45-63, devotes a lengthy discussion to the abilities of animals to assess numbers, a capacity, H?user maintains, of decided value in enabling species to evaluate the size of food supplies, the numbers of potential enemies in a pack of predators, and various other crucial life situations. As in the case of Rogers, H?user acknowledges that we do not yet fully understand how animals manage to be such efficient "number crunchers" as some species would seem to be. 5. References to these and other examples of the unique emotional lives of humans are conveniently gathered in Sorabji, op. cit. pp. 90-92. In fairness to the ancients, we should note that almost every claim of human uniqueness is countered by one ancient authority or another at some point. We should note as well that behaviors which one writer considers a mark of human superiority, another takes as evidence of animal supe riority. Plutarch, Bruta animalia ralione uti 990D, takes the seasonal mating activities of animals to be a sign of their continence, and he observes there that animals likewise re frain from homosexual unions. This Plutarchan treatise is somewhat unusual in ancient literature relating to animal psychology in arguing that animals are actually superior to humans in many respects, an attitude called "theriophily" by G. Boas, who analyzes the concept in his article 'Theriophily5, Dictionary of the History of Ideas iv, ed. by P. P. Wie ner, New York 1973, pp. 384-389. Boas defines theriophily there, p. 384, as "... a complex of ideas which express an admiration for the ways and character of the animals," which holds in general that animals are either rational or, if not, are better off without reason. Boas had earlier discussed theriophily in The Happy Beast in French Thought of the Seven teenth Century, Baltimore 1933, where, p. 1, he had charmingly characterized the attitude as marked by "admiring glances below man". 6.

In its most common manifestation, which is the particular focus of Renehan's discussion, this form of the topos holds that only man, of all animal species, has a spark of the divine in him, making him alone an imi tation of the gods.

Naturally enough, this assertion of man's unique stature found favor with religious apologists ranging from the Jew Philo to early Christian writers who recalled God's decree (Genesis 1: 26) that man shall be created in His image and likeness.7 In the final section of his dialogue De animalibus (100), Philo warns his interlocutor against committing sacrilege by being misled by appearances of rationality in animals into elevating them to the level of humankind and thereby venerating animals rather than the image of God that man represents. Among Christian writers whom Renehan cites on this manifestation of the topos, the apologist Nemesius gives a specifically Christian coloring to the topos when he declares that of all an imals, man is the only one to experience resurrection and immortality, x? ?.iovov x?ov ?XXojv (?cpcov x? xoirtou o&amp;&gt;\ia [iex? dav?xou ?viaxacrfrai xai ei? ?f)avaa?av x gelv.8 Although Renehan accords more detailed analysis to ancient claims of man's unique relation to the divine than to any other example of the "man alone of animals" topos, what is perhaps the most surprising and unex 7. Philo devoted much attention to attempting to prove that the human mind (vo??) was patterned after the divine mind, and he was firmly opposed to the idea that animals shared in the divine mind with man. For a detailed examination of Philo's conception of the nature of animalkind as it differs from humankind, see S. T. Newmyer, 'Philo on Ani mal Psychology: Sources and Moral Implications', in From Athens to Jerusalem: Medicine in Hellenized Jewish Lore and in Early Christian Literature, ed. by S. Kottek and M. Horstman shoff, Rotterdam 2000, pp. 143-155. Christianity's attitudes toward animals as they were conditioned by biblical pronouncements on man's superiority to them according to Go d's decree in Genesis and by classical philosophical notions have been severely censured in the literature of the animal rights movement. Theologian A. Linzey, Animal Theology, Urbana 1995, argues that the anthropocentric view prevalent in Western theology, which justifies any human action toward animals that humans deem necessary and desi rable, must be rejected in favor of a more sympathetic ethic of compassion toward other species. See also Sorabji, op. cit. pp. 195-207 for a detailed discussion of what that scholar terms, p. 207, "the pro- and anti-animal strands in Christianity." 8. Renehan, art. cit. pp. 250-251.</page><page sequence="5">Ancients and Moderns on the Religious Sensibilities of Animals 115 pected manifestation of this claim passes almost without comment in his article. In a miscellaneous listing of what he terms "various other distinc tive human characteristics", Renehan mentions, without any further dis cussion, that Plato and Xenophon expressed the opinion that "religion is peculiar to man".9 Perhaps Renehan felt this assertion was so obviously true as to require no further elaboration. In any case, the reader comes away from Renehan's article with no appreciation for the fact that the no tion of the possibility of religious sensibilities in animals was raised by a significant number of Greek and Roman thinkers. The question of whether animals have some understanding of the concept of the divine was treated by some ancient authorities as one side of the debate as to whether animals possess in themselves some part of the divine. The two issues are not uniformly differentiated in ancient discussions, as Rene han's treatment would seem to suggest. This is clear from Plato's asser tion (Prot. 322A), the two clauses of which Renehan cites as if they were il lustrative of separate topics, 5Ejt8l?t] ?? ? a vOqoojtoc fMa? jiex?oxe jioicja?, jiQ?rcov ji?v ?i? xrjv xoD f}eov3 cruyyeveiav ? v jix?vov freo?? ?vojiiaev. The philosopher's point here is that, precisely because humans have the di vine spark (fMa? jiex?o/s jioiQa?), they alone of animals worship the gods (Xtpoov [l?vov fMr?? ev?^iioev). The passage from Xenophon which Rene han mentions, without providing the Greek text, as illustrative of the idea that man alone worships the gods (Mem. 1, 4, 13) develops in such a way that the two complementary notions, that man alone understands divin ity and man alone possesses the divine in him, are juxtaposed. Renehan refers only to Socrates' question in Mem. 1, 4, 13, xi ?? cpDkrv ?Xko f\ cxvOqoojtol fteo??

One might indeed be tempted to follow Renehan's lead and dismiss the question of whether an imals have religious sensibilities were it not so frequently encountered in ancient authors, some of whom defend the possibility while others reject it as patently absurd. What renders the ancient debate so intriguing for modern students of classical attitudes toward non-human species is the 9. Renehan, art. cit. p. 250.</page><page sequence="6">ii6 Stephen T. Newmyer fact that the issue has resurfaced in recent decades in the sober treatises of contemporary biologists and animal psychologists. Moreover, the exam ples of apparent religious expression by animals and the arguments for and against the proposition that animals have themselves a religious di mension are surprisingly similar in ancient and modern discussions of the concept. Supporters, both ancient and modern, of the idea that some species of animals exhibit behaviors that seem to suggest a worshipful demeanor and a yearning to humble themselves before a greater spiritual power, rely largely upon apparent analogies between animal behaviors and hu man behaviors indicative of religious devotion. This approach has laid modern researchers open to charges of a naive anthropomorphism that makes too much of what may in fact be coincidental resemblances, a charge to which modern philosophers and biologists who specialize in the study of animal behavior remain acutely sensitive.10 At the same time, modern philosophers and scientists who oppose the idea that some ani mal species possess religious sensibilities often rely on a line of reasoning peculiarly Aristotelian in inspiration, that holds that moral sensibilities are a function of a gradual progression of refinement in mental capacities which, in the case of so sophisticated a concept as religious belief, out strips those of even the most advanced animal species. As the above analysis of passages from Plato and Xenophon suggests, the Greek case against the proposition that animals are capable of mani festing religious sensibilities was articulated primarily by philosophers, while the opposite possibility, that animals do indeed exhibit such sensi bilities, was most fully explored, perhaps not surprisingly, in compila tions of nature's wonders and in treatises dealing with what might be called "animal psychology". In addition to his observation discussed above (Prot. 322A) that because humans are the only animal species to pos sess a spark of the divine, only they worship the gods, Plato also asserted, in a passage that combines Athenian pride with an almost breathtaking anthropocentrism, that Athens was a land uniquely loved by the gods, for at a time when the gods were producing wild animals to inhabit other re ?o. Prominent ethologist F. de Waal has well summarized the pitfalls and promise of anthropomorphic observations on animal behavior in his work Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals, Cambridge Ma. 1996, p. 66, "Critics say there is no way to see what goes on inside an animal's head. That is, of course, not lite rally what cognitive ethologists are trying to do. Rather, they seek to reconstruct mental processes in much the same way the nuclear physicist looks inside' the atom by testing predictions based on a model of the structure. Admittedly, the use of anthropomor phism and anecdotal evidence ... [has] created uncertainty and confusion - as well as li vely debate. Yet these are only the delivery7 pains of a much-needed change in the study of animal behavior".</page><page sequence="7">Ancients and Moderns on the Religious Sensibilities of Animals 117 gions of the world, Athens proved itself barren of animals but productive of human beings, that species who surpasses all others in intelligence and alone reverences justice and the gods (Men. 237D), rpex?oa [se. x^Qa] ... ?y?vvnoev ?vujQoojrov, ? auv?oei xe ?meQ?xei xarv ?XX v xai ?ixnv xai f}eo?? ?iovov vo^ei.11 Aristotle seems to have agreed with Plato that, in addition to the anatomical aspects of human uniqueness, man is likewise unique in pos sessing a religious dimension, a proposition at which the philosopher hinted in a discussion of happiness in his Nicomaehean Ethics. He argued there that perfect happiness is a form of contemplative activity (deooQuxixr) ?v?Qyeia). The lives of the gods must be regarded as transcen dently happy because such contemplation is the activity proper to god head, and humans are themselves happy to the extent that their lives con tain some likeness to this contemplative activity (?[xo??)[x? xi xf)? xoia?xuc evepyeiac, EN 1178b 28). No other animal is thus happy because none pos sesses this capacity for contemplation (x v ?' ?XXwv ?cpoov o???v e?oai ?love?, ?jtei?r] o??ajji] xoivoovei deooQia?, EN 1178b 29-30). The conclusion to be drawn from Aristotle's argument here, left unstated by the philoso pher, would seem to be that contemplation of the divine is likewise the exclusive province of human beings. Similar sentiments are to be found in Latin writers. Cicero, who sub scribed to the Stoic doctrine that human beings can owe nothing to ani mals because animals cannot reason,12 asserted (ND 2, 153) that man's rea son has penetrated to the heavens, so that only man can contemplate the celestial bodies and arrive thereby at a knowledge of the gods and an ap preciation of the virtues that lead to the happy life. Cicero, like Aristotle, linked the capacity for contemplation of the divine with the attainment of happiness, and agrees with the Greek that that capacity lies solely with human beings. We are, he concludes, inferior to the gods only in not pos sessing the immortality they enjoy. Earlier in the same treatise, Cicero had declared man's upright posture to be an aid to contemplating the gods, an attainment which no other creature can claim (ND 2, 140, sunt n. We should note, however, that Plato, who is often rather ambiguous in his attitu des toward the intellectual capacities of animals, seems to leave the door open to the possibility that animals are capable of some sort of religious sensibilities since he twice declares humans to be the most god-fearing of creatures (Tim. 42A, xwv ?cpcov x? Oeooe?e oxaxov; Leg. 902B, deoaE?e?xaxov am? e?xi Jt?vxoov ?cpcov av{&gt;Q(jojto?). This ambiguity may result from Plato's ultimate indecision on the question of whether the animal soul con tains a rational element, on which Sorabji, op. cit. p. 10, remarks, "... he does waver on the subject to the end...". 12. Cicero, Off. 1, 50, neque ulla re longius absumus a natura fer arum, in quibus inesse fortitu dinem saepe dicimus, ut in equis, in leonibus, iustitiam, aequitatem, bonitatem non dicimus; sunt enim rationis et orationis expertes.</page><page sequence="8">ii8 Stephen T. Newmyer enim ex terra homines non ut incolae atque habitatores sed quasi spectatores su perarum rerum atque caelestium, quorum spectaculum ad nullum aliud genus animantium pertinet). Quite similar is his assertion (Leg. 1, 24) that because human beings have a common origin and ancestry with the gods (cum cae lestibus vel genus vel stirps), only humans therefore have any knowledge of the divine (itaque ex tot generibus nullum est animal praeter hominem, quod habeat notitiam aliquam dei). In Cicero's view, only humans have both the mental capacity needed to understand the divine and the inclination to ward contemplation of the divine, resulting from natural kinship with the gods, that can inspire religious sensibilities in them. The Christian apologist Lactantius, writing in the third century CE., evolved a concept of the nature of animalkind that both mirrors that of Ci cero and moves beyond him in allowing animals certain intellectual en dowments which Cicero and the Stoics had denied them.13 In his treatise De ira dei, the apologist had ascribed to animals a type of communication that resembles language, and some capacity for joy (Ira 7, 10, quaedam similitudo sermonis; quaedam signa laetitiae). Remarkably, he also allows them some degree of intelligence and thought, which enables them to find their way from their lairs in times of danger, a capability they would not exhibit, he notes, if they did not have a spark of intellect (Ira 7, 10, atquin sunt animalia quae laetibulis suis diversos et plures exitus pandant ut, si quod periculum incident, fuga pateat obsessis; quod non facerent, nisi inesset Ulis intelligentia et cogitatio). It would seem, he concludes, that the only capac ity which animals do not possess in at least some degree is religion itself (Ira 7, 12, apparet solam esse religionem cuius in mutis nee vestigium aliquod nee ulla suspicio inveniri potest). Earlier in this treatise, Lactantius had quoted the passage from Cicero discussed above (Leg. 1, 24) in defense of his belief that only man has religious sentiments (Ira 7, 6, propterea nullum est animal, ut ait Cicero, praeter hominem quod habeat notitiam dei. Solus enim sapientia instructus est ut religionem solus intellegat, et haec est hominis atque mutorum vel praecipua vel sola distantia).14 It is noteworthy that Lactantius specu lates here that the capacity for religion may in fact be the only factor that differentiates humans from other animals. A striking fact that emerges from analysis of the passages cited above is that a number of thinkers who expressed the view that animals were inca pable of religious sensibilities did not feel obligated to supply arguments 13. For a discussion of Stoic attitudes toward the intellectual capacities of animals, see S. T. Newmyer, 'Plutarch on Justice toward Animals: Ancient Insights on a Modern De bate', Scholia: Natal Stud. Class. Ant. n. s. 1, 1992, pp. 38-54, and 'Speaking of Beasts', cit. 102-107; and Sorabji, op. cit. passim. 14. Lactantius had cited this same passage from Cicero in his treatise ?nstitutiones Divi nae 3, 10, again there calling religion a possession unique to humans (suo proprio et singu lari bono).</page><page sequence="9">Ancients and Moderns on the Religious Sensibilities of Animals 119 in support of their position. Perhaps they felt that the opposite possibility was so absurd as to require no rebuttal. Aristotle came closest to supply ing such an argument in his discussion of contemplative activity and its relation to the nature of the divine (EN 1178b 28). In asserting there that human beings experience happiness to the extent that they are capable of a mental state that bears some likeness (??j,o?(D|ia) to the contemplative ac tivity that is found in a perfect state in divine beings, Aristotle appears to allude to his doctrine of ouv?xeia, a sort of biological gradation or conti nuity according to which nature advances, by gradual degrees, from the lower animals to mankind, a principle which the philosopher elucidated in his zoological treatises Historia animalium and De partibus animalium. While humans share some intellectual capacities with divine beings, in cluding their ability to experience something akin to contemplative activ ity, Aristotle maintained at the same time that, although animals may ad vance gradually toward humankind in some of their capabilities, this ap parently does not include any significant mental kinship. In the opening chapter of Historia animalium, Aristotle argued that, while some animals may have traces (i'xvr], HA 588a 20) of some human characteristics, they have only resemblances of intelligence (xfj? jre?? xr\v ?iccvoiav Girv?oeooc; ?|iOLOxr]xe?, HA 588a 23-24). Such human attainments as skill, wisdom, and intelligence (ev ?vdQobjto) x?xvn xai aocp?a xai ?uve?ic, HA 588a 29-30) are present in animals only in a kind of similar mental capacity (?ori xi? ?x??a xouxuxr] (puoixr] ?irva^ii?;, HA 588a 30-31). In contrast, because religious sen sibilities entail mental capacities that lie outside the range of animal intel lect, animals do not possess even the resemblance of such sensibilities.15 While he allows a somewhat more generous construction of animal in tellect than had Aristotle, admitting that animals have in some respects more than mere traces or resemblances of corresponding human mental ca pacities, Lactantius seems, nevertheless, to have agreed with his Greek predecessor in conceiving intellectual development from species to 15. Aristotle's concept of ouv?xeia is elaborated in his treatise De partibus animalium at PA 68ia 12-15. On Aristotle's intention to exclude intellect from the gradualism that he otherwise allows in nature's development of life types, see Sorabji, op. cit. p. 13, "Even Aristotle's gradualism in biology is carefully qualified so that it allows for a sharp intel lectual distinction between animal and man". The doctrine of ouvexeia was an important contributing element to the philosophical concept called in later ages the scala naturae or Chain of Being. Aristotle's contribution to this concept is assessed in the classic work of A. O. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea, Cambridge 1936; see especially pp. 55-59. In its medieval manifestation, the doctrine of the Great Chain of Being viewed the universe, in Lovejoy's words, p. 59, as composed of "... an immense, or - by the strict but seldom vigorously applied logic of the principle of continuity - of an infinite number of links ranging in hierarchical order from the meagerest kind of exi stents, which barely escape non-existence, through 'every possible' grade up to the ens perfectissimum...".</page><page sequence="10">120 Stephen T. Newmyer species as a process of gradation. Yet whereas Aristotle denied the possi bility of religious sensibilities in animals because their intellectual capaci ties are only similar to those of humans, however much they may ad vance toward human nature in other attainments, Lactantius allowed ani mals some genuine intellectual kinship with humans as well as some simi larities to other human attainments, but he set a firm and unequivocal boundary between the species in the matter of a capacity for religious sensibilities. At the conclusion of his discussion of examples of what he terms "the ?l?vov x??rv ?cporv ?vf)Qcojto? topos," Renehan observes, "It would not be difficult to quadruple these specimens, so thoroughly anthropocentric had the Greek mind become",16 and he adds that it would be an easy mat ter as well to supply numerous examples of Latin writers who subscribed to this anthropocentric view. In the remainder of his article, Renehan demonstrates that hints of a belief in man's uniqueness can be traced as far back as Homer, long before Greek philosophers developed the notion into a coherent philosophical theory.17 In the course of his discussion, he makes some effort to argue away apparent assertions in Greek sources that animals do in fact exhibit certain human excellences generally con sidered unique to humans, as, for example, Archilochus' attribution of justice to animals, which Renehan explains as due to its occurrence in a fa ble, a genre in which animals regularly take on human values.18 It is not surprising that one will look in vain in Renehan for a mention of those writers who were willing to countenance the view that at least some species of animals have a concept of divinity and consequently engage in activities that might be regarded as manifestations of worship. While the majority of Greek writers who raise this possibility base their case on ex amples of animal behaviors that would without hesitation be identified as worshipful attitudes if observed in human beings, at least one Greek writer, Plutarch, builds a case for religious sensibilities in animals that combines citation of such examples with an argument for animal rational ity that in some respects mirrors the gradualist stance of Aristotle's biol ogy discussed above, although Plutarch arrives at a conclusion therefrom that differs strikingly from that of his predecessor.

Among clever animals, the ant, bee and spider were frequently cited for the apparent complexity of their homes and for their industrious lifestyles. At the same time, the swallow was often praised for combining admirable craftsmanship in the construc tion of its nest with noteworthy prudence in the rearing of its young.19 To such lists of standard examples, one might add elephants, who seem to have impressed ancient writers as creatures especially endowed with spir itual sensibilities, although the idea that animals have a conception of the divine is found already in the Academic Xenocrates, without reference to any specific species.20 An extensive account of worshipful elephants is found in Pliny the El der, who credits the creatures as well with some virtues rarely encoun tered in humans, including honesty, wisdom and justice (NH 8, 1, quae etiam in homine rara, probitas, prudentia, aequitas). In Mauretania, the natu ralist continues, elephants are known to go down to the river and to per form upon themselves a ritual of purification (NH 8, 2, se purificantes sollemniter aqua conspergi). Pliny even attributes to the animals an under standing of the religious scruples of human beings, noting that elephants will not consent to board ships before their mahouts promise under oath to bring them back home, the solemnity of the oath being apparently comprehensible to the animals and required by them before they trust the humans (NH 8,3, alienae quoque religionis intellectu creduntur maria transituri non ante naves conscendere quam invitati rectoris iureiurando de reditu). As to their own religious sensibilities, Pliny records that elephants when weary 19- Examples of such animal excellences are catalogued in A. Dyroff, 'Zur stoischen Tierpsychologie', Bl?tter fir das Gymnasial-Schulwesen 33, 1897, PP- 399-404 and 34, 1898, pp. 416-430, and in S. O. Dickerman, 'Some Stock Illustrations of Animal Intelligence in Greek Psychology', Trans. Am. Philol. Ass. 42, 1911, pp. 123-130. Dickerman concludes, p. 130, that observations on the cleverness of various insects and other animals found in Aristotle, Cicero, Philo and Plutarch may ultimately all be derived from Alcmaeon of Crot?n. 20.

A similar, non species-specific assertion of a recognition of the divine by animals occurs in the twelfth oration of Dio Chrysostom, in the course of his discussion of how contemplation of the order of the universe inspires in man an awed recognition of the workings of the divine, a reaction that according to Dio extends even to animals and encourages them to wish to live, like humans, in accord with the laws of heaven (Or. 12, 35, ov y??&gt; em to?v dvdQcojt?ov t? toio?tov yiyv?fievov ?au|i?oai ti? ?v, noXv ?? \i?Xkov ojtoo? xai \i?XQi xwv Otjqlcov ?nxve?Tai T?)v acpQ?voov xai od?ywv, ? xai Taira yiyvdb?xeiv xai Tifi?v t?v fte?v xai JTQodufMaOai t,f|v xar? t?v ?xeivou deoji?v).</page><page sequence="12">122 Stephen T.

Pliny's use here of such qualifying words as creduntur and veluti in his explication of elephant religiosity should perhaps give one pause before ascribing to him a total acceptance of the wonders that he retails, especially when this fact is combined with his observation, at the outset of his discussion of elephants (NH 8, 1), that they come closest (proximum) to humans in intelligence, but he does not at any point in his discussion of elephant religiosity express any specific doubt as to the veracity of the anecdotes that he records.21 At the same time, his account betrays evidences of the reliance on analogies with hu man religious practices to ascribe similar feelings to animals, and of the overall anthropomorphism that would mark ancient defenses of the posi tion that animals possess religious sensibilities. No such qualifiers are found in the enthusiastic portrait of the religious practices of elephants included in the seventeen books of Aelian's De natura animalium, a treatise filled with morally uplifting tales intended to illustrate the author's thesis that animals often behave in a manner more to be admired than is the conduct of human beings.22 Elephants, Aelian informs his readers, lift tree trunks to the new moon and wave them about gently, as if offering a suppliant's olive branch in hopes that the di vine moon will be propitious to them (NA 4, 10, olov ixexr|Q?av xiv? xairxr|v xf\ f&gt;Bcp JtQOXSLVOVxa? vk?Q xov ?lecov xe xai efj^ievf) xrjv f&gt;8?v ye eivai av xo??). Later, he recounts that elephants worship the rising sun as well, raising their trunks like hands to the sun (NA 7, 4, x?v fj?iov ?v?axovxa jtqooxuvo?jgiv ?^?cpavxe?, x?? jroo?ooxioac ev??v xf|? ?xx?vo? ?&gt;? x8^Qab ?vaxeivovxe?). This behavior leads Aelian to the typically moralizing com ment that while elephants worship the gods, humans are in doubt as to whether the gods exist or care about humans (NA 7, 4, ?X?cpavxe? ?lev ovv 21. In her valuable study of Pliny as natural philosopher, M. Beagon, Roman Nature: The Thought of Pliny the Elder, Oxford 1992, notes, p. 139, that Pliny "is sometimes at pains to admire the accomplishments of certain animals", of whom the elephant seems to have been the special object of the naturalist's wonder. Yet she cautions the reader that Pliny, despite his obvious enthusiasms, is always careful to stress that even the most in telligent of animals can display only imitations or approximations of human accompli shments. She observes, p. 139, "His admiration of animal accomplishments is remarka ble; yet it need not lead to the conclusion that he seriously challenges man's position of supremacy in nature". 22. On Aelian's moralizing bent, see R. French, Ancient Natural History: Histories of Na ture, London 1994, p. 139, "Man differed from animals, according to Aelian and other later writers, in disobeying the dictates of the law that applied to them. This gave a rich store of examples of how animals behaved more morally than man".</page><page sequence="13">Ancients and Moderns on the Religious Sensibilities of Animals 123 fleovj?

An intriguing variant in the ancient catalogue of worshipful animals, which otherwise relies so heavily on examples derived from the behavior of elephants, is found in Philostratus' life of Apollonius of Tyana, wherein the Sophist describes a banquet attended by Apollonius at the home of the shadowy figure Damis who figures prominently in Philostratus' biogra phy. Various exotic meats were served on the occasion, including whole lions, gazelles, and certain parts of tigers. The host and his compatriots re frained, however, from eating the paws of tigers, on the grounds that the animals raise their front paws to the sun at its rising (VA 2, 28, x? y?o X-OLjr? xo?j frriQiou jiaoatxo?jvxai ?ofKeiv, ?jtei?r] x? ? ov xo?xo, cpaoiv, ?xav jiQ?bxov y?v?]xai, xorj? ejoiJtQoad?orjc xcov jto?oov avtoxovxi a?oeiv x(h r|Xup). Unfortunately, the author does not elaborate, but it is clear that Damis' people have made an anthropomorphizing analogy between the position ing of the animals' paws and an attitude of the arms commonly observed in human prayer. In the case of Plutarch, a defense of religious sensibilities in animals fol lows almost as a natural consequence of his conception of animal intel lect, which betrays a much more generous view of the mental capacities of non-human species than can be found in other ancient sources, since Plutarch accords some degree of reason to all animals.23 In the introduc tory chapters of his dialogue De sollertia animalium, his most extensive ex amination of animal mentation, Plutarch has the interlocutor Autobulus allude to the subject of the previous day's discussion, in which the posi tion had been advanced that all animals partake to some degree of reason and intellect (De sollertia animalium 960A, ?jtocpr]v?|j,evoi y?o ?x^??, ?&gt;? otada, jiex?xeiv ajiooayejiooc jx?vxa x? ^a&gt;a ?iavoia? xai ^oyi?|iofj). It is not surprising, therefore, to find in Plutarch the assertion that, according to the historian Juba, elephants combine social instincts with intelligence (De sollertia animalium 972B, x? ye jjt]v xolvojvlxov jiex? xo?j orjvexo?j xovj? ?^?cpavxa? ?jTooeixvvjcr&amp;aL cpr|?iv ?

Plutarch's animal psychology has been the subject of a number of recent studies. See, for example, S. T. Newmyer, 'Plutarch on Justice toward Animals', cit. pp. 40-53; A.

While Plutarch's account here so closely parallels that of Pliny and Aelian that one may suspect a common source, it is noteworthy that Plutarch draws a specific analogy between the form that the apparent religious ministrations of elephants take and those ob servable in human beings. Plutarch's suggestion here that elephants possess a capacity for reli gious feelings because they share with other species a degree of reason and intellect should be viewed in conjunction with his observation else where in the treatise De sollertia animalium that persons err who maintain that a creature that is not by nature designed to receive the perfection of reason does not therefore possess any degree of reason (De sollertia ani malium 962C, ? ?5 ?^Lcbv x? ?ir] jreqjuxoc; ?Q?r?xrjxa X?you ??xeadai ?in?? X? yov ??x?crf}ai). All intellectual capacities, in humans and animals alike, are, in Plutarch's view, a matter of degree, for while reason is implanted by nature in all animals, perfect reason is attained only through practice and education, advantages which only humans can be expected to enjoy (De sollertia animalium 962C, Xoyo? ?.lev y?o eyy?vexai cp?oei, aicovj?a?o? ?? ?oyo? xai x?^eio? ?? ?jiijieXeia? xai ?i?aaxaXia?;). For Plutarch, the differ ence between human intellect and that of animals is rather quantitative than qualitative.24 It appears, from his assertions that all creatures possess some degree of reason and that intellectual superiority is ultimately a matter of practice and training, that Plutarch subscribed to a concept of bi ological gradualism similar to that of Aristotle, but, unlike his great prede cessor, Plutarch did not posit an uncrossable gulf between lower animals and human beings in the matter of possession of reason, a gulf which served to halt the slow advancement of capabilities otherwise observable in animal species. It is hardly surprising, in view of his generous concep tion of animal intelligence, that Plutarch could countenance the notion of religious sensibilities in animals.25 24- This point is made by Becchi, 'Istinto', p. 73, f'Anzi, proprio in soil. anim. si am mette una differenza almeno quantitativa tra l'intelligenza animale e quella umana". Becchi has recently refined and elaborated this position, specifically likening Plutarch's approach to animal psychology to that of an ethologist, and observing, 'Irrazionalit? e Razionalit?', p. 207, that Plutarch's view of animals is "... quella dell'etologo ehe osserva e studia comparativamente il comportamento animale rispetto a quello dell'uomo, rile vando similarit? e analogie nella pro fonda convinzione dell'appartenenza dell'animale e delfuomo alia medesima scala biol?gica, anche se situad a due differenti livelli". 25. There is tantalizing evidence that Plutarch was about to take up the subject of the religious sensibilities of animals in his humorous dialogue Bruta animalia ratione uti, whe</page><page sequence="15">Ancients and Moderns on the Religious Sensibilities of Animals 125 The peculiar debate outlined above is currently undergoing a modest rebirth in the writings of cognitive ethologists, those biologists who spe cialize in the study of animal behavior in natural settings unfettered by the constraints of laboratory conditions. While the conclusions drawn by such scientists at times rely on anecdotal evidence and apparent analogies between animal and human behavior, which at times lays cognitive ethol ogists open to the charge of anthropomorphism so clearly in evidence in the ancient examples cited above, ethologists defend their conclusions by noting that, in common with the methodology of other scientists, their conclusions are subjected to the strict requirements of scientific investiga tion. As ethologist Frans deWaal states the methodology of cognitive ethology, "... Vignettes do not constitute scientific proof. They tease the imagination and sometimes hint at striking capacities, yet cannot demon strate them. Only repeated observations and solid data allow us to com pare alternative hypotheses and arrive at firm conclusions".26 Although the investigative methodologies of contemporary cognitive ethology, as deWaal characterizes them, are considerably more sophisti cated that those in evidence in the treatises of ancient animal psycholo gists and compilers of amazing animal anecdotes, it is noteworthy that elephants surface as well in ethological literature as potential candidates for possession of religious feelings, although other species of animals are sometimes singled out in this regard. At the same time, cognitive etholo gists have developed a more comprehensive idea of what might consti tute religious expression in animals than is observable in ancient sources. Ethologist Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, for example, would include such el ements as feelings of awe and righteousness, a sense of shame, and a de sire for self-abasement among those elements that contribute to religios ity. He notes, for example, that the behavior of dogs in showing their un derbellies to their human masters has been likened to the sort of submis sion that humans exhibit in praying. Masson adopts a somewhat cautious rein Plutarch offers a thought-provoking twist on the scene in Odyssey 10 in which Circe has turned Odysseus' men into swine. The animals' philosophical "spokespig" Gryllus ("Oinker," "Grunter") rejects Odysseus' efforts to induce the witch to reconvert his men into humans on the grounds that animals possess all the excellences of humans without any of their shortcomings. These excellences include judgement, rationality and me mory (Bruta animalia ratione uti 992E). To this assertion by Gryllus, Odysseus asks if it is not a wrenching piece of violence to allow reason to creatures that possess no concep tion of god (Bruta animalia ratione uti 992E, 'AM.' ooa, TovlXz, \ii\ ?etv?v f] xai ?ioaov ?itoXi jte?v ^?yov ol? o?w eYyivexai deo? vot|?lc). Unfortunately, the text of the treatise breaks off at this point and Gryllus' reply is lost, but it would seem likely that the pig would have argued that animals do in fact possess the capacity for religious sensibilities if such fee lings are a function of rationality, since Plutarch had argued that animals are to some de gree rational. 26. deWaal, op. cit. p. 3.</page><page sequence="16">126 Stephen T. Newmyer position concerning the validity of this analogy, arguing that while reli gious feelings are not emotionless, it may be possible that emotions that surface in religious expression in human beings find other emotional out lets in animals.27 Nevertheless, he is willing to concede on this behavior in dogs, "Further study of such dynamics could shed considerable light on human religious rites".28 The complex patterns of social behavior in elephants have in recent decades attracted considerable attention from ethologists interested in the emotional lives of animals, including the emotions associated with re ligious feelings. Ethologists have been fascinated, for example, by the of ten-observed tendency of elephants to return to the scene of the death of one of their comrades, and to touch the bones of the dead animal. Masson notes on this behavior, "They are strongly interested in elephant bones, not at all in the bones of other species. Their reaction to elephant bones is so predictable that cinematographers have no difficulty filming elephants examining bones. Smelling them, turning them over, running their trunks over the bones, the elephants pick them up, feel them, and some times carry them off for a distance before dropping them".29 If this charac teristic response is a sign of sympathy for the dead and a mark of mourn ing behavior in elephants, as some ethologists consider it to be, it may serve to suggest that these highly-intelligent animals experience to some degree the feelings of awe and wonderment that contribute to the reli gious experience in humans, not least in the human response to death. An intriguing example of contemporary belief in the religious sensibili ties of animals that bears a striking resemblance to the ancient examples discussed above is recorded in the work of primatologist Alison Jolly who has devoted much study to the lemurs of Madagascar. Certain tribes there have observed that when sifaka lemurs sit in tree branches in the early morning, they face the sun and close their eyes, behavior that has caused the tribesmen to conclude that the lemurs are worshipping the sun. Al though apparently tempted to concur in the interpretation of the tribes men, Jolly allows scientific objectivity to win out when she notes, "It is difficult to watch a sunning lemur without being anthropomorphic, but to Western eyes it seems less like religious fervor than like our indolent cult xj.

Masson's comments here are derived substantially from ma terial recorded in C. Moss, Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Fa mily, New York 1988. Similar reflections on the meaning of the mourning behavior of elephants are found in deWaal, op. cit. pp. 53-54.</page><page sequence="17">Ancients and Moderns on the Religious Sensibilities of Animals 127 of Sunday at the beach".30 Despite devoting considerable effort in his work to defending the position that, based on repeated and carefully recorded observations by ethologists, it would appear that animals expe rience such emotional states as love, fear, anger, joy and cruelty, Masson concurs with Jolly that the religious impulse lies beyond the emotional range of animals, concluding, "Animals do not seem to need to believe in higher powers. Animals have not been observed to have religious prac tices, while people do".31 Masson's rationale for drawing this conclusion has a curiously Aristotelian ring, recalling the philosopher's doctrine of oirv?xeia, or biological gradualism, for Masson appears to believe that, just as Aristotelian gradualism held that there are points beyond which animals cannot advance because of the absence of a rational faculty in them, so does modern science suggest that animal brains may simply not be equipped to grasp such complex constructs as religious feelings. "It is possible", Masson argues, "that there are emotions people feel that no other animals feel. Leaving aside the unimpressive history of human at tempts to claim uniqueness, it should be conceded that many species do have attributes that no others do. Pelicans have unusual bills, elephants have trunks, platypuses have poison spurs; perhaps human beings can claim religious awe".32 In his work Wild Minds: What Animals Really Think, animal cognition re searcher Marc D. H?user has subjected the claims of Masson to searching criticism, accusing him and other animal researchers of being seduced by a weakness for facile anthropomorphization that leads them to draw questionable conclusions about the emotive states of animals. In particu lar, H?user cautions that examples of animal behavior appearing to re semble human behavior might be open to more than one interpretation, and that such interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive.33 While H?user acknowledges that there is some scientific evidence to sug gest that certain animal species have emotional interactions with their physical and psychological worlds, he denies them the capacity for moral emotions and moral senses. They cannot, in his view, experience empa thy, sympathy, shame, guilt or loyalty because animal minds lack the one intellectual dimension necessary to such emotions. "The reason for this emotional hole in their lives", H?user asserts, "is that they lack a funda mental mental tool: self-awareness. [T]here is no evidence that they are 30. A. Jolly, Lemur Behavior: A Madagascar Field Study, New York 1966, p. 36. 31. Masson, op. cit. p. 213. 32. Masson, op. cit. p. 212. 33. H?user, op. cit. pp. 8-9. Characteristically, H?user, op. cit. p. 5, brands Masson's ob servations on the emotions of dogs as "replete with disturbing and confusing asser tions".</page><page sequence="18">128 Stephen T. Newmyer actually aware of their own beliefs and desires, and how they differ from those of their peers...".34 Without a capacity for self-awareness, animals can have no understanding of what H?user terms "death as a system of beliefs".35 This system includes a notion of time, of futurity, and perhaps, in the case of animals, of killing and being killed. There is to date, in Haus er's estimation, no evidence to suggest that animal species have this level of understanding, but he is willing to allow that future research may force him to alter his opinion.36 Although H?user nowhere specifically ad dresses the question of religious sensibilities in animals, a lack of self awareness in them would seem to preclude the possibility of such sensi bilities if, as in the case of an understanding of death, a sense of the other worldly that would seem essential to religious sentiments would entail some comprehension of one's place in the continuum of existence. In any case, H?user concludes that, while elephants may, in their behavior to ward the bones of their comrades, feel genuine loss and grief, there is still no evidence that they have an understanding of death.37 For him, the pos sibility that elephants demonstrate religious sensibilities in such actions would be equally out of the question. It is noteworthy, however, that, de spite his strictures against what he considers the overly-enthusiastic ten dency of some ethologists to see parallels to human behaviors in animal actions, Hauser's rationale for rejecting the possibility of certain intellec tual attainments in animal species reflects the same Aristotelian gradual ism that marks Masson's explanation: perhaps animals, because of their less developed intellects, can approach only so close to human beings, and perhaps, because of this intellectual inferiority, a gulf will always ex ist between the intellectual capacities of even the most advanced animal species and those of humans. The researches of ethologist Frans de Waal suggest, on the other hand, that the question of whether animals experience in some form the moral sensibilities of humans may after all still not be answered. "... I hesitate to call the members of any species other than our own 'moral beings'", de Waal observes, "yet I also believe that many of the sentiments and cogni tive abilities underlying human morality antedate the appearance of our species on this planet".38 de Waal concurs with Masson and H?user that the difference between human and animal moral sensibilities may be largely one of gradation, but he would disagree with their positing a sharp break between animal and human moral sensibilities on Aristotelian 34- Hauser, op. cit. p. 224. 35.

He sees the key to the question in recent advances in neurobiology. "Morality is as firmly grounded in neurobiology as anything else we do or are", deWaal maintains. "Once thought of as purely spiritual matters, honesty, guilt, and the weighing of moral dilemmas are traceable to specific areas of the brain. It should not surprise us, therefore, to find animal parallels. The human brain is a product of evolution. Despite its larger volume and greater complexity, it is fundamentally similar to the central nervous sys tem of other mammals".39 In de Waal's view, neurobiology has proven that some species have at least the prerequisite mental tools to allow them a glimpse at moral sensibilities, although no animal species has yet been shown to possess such sensibilities to the degree that is recognizable in human beings. "Let us simply conclude", he suggests, "that they oc cupy a number of floors on the tower of morality".40 While de Waal's phraseology here is again distinctly Aristotelian, it is remarkable that he refrains from positing a sharp break between animal and human mental capacities and moral sensibilities, and in so doing he recalls Plutarch's be lief that some differences between animals and humans are more a matter of education and practice than of inherent mental capacities (De sollertia animalium 962C-D). de Waal's analysis leaves open the question of where, in the tower of morality that he envisions, the moral dimension that might be termed religious sensibility would enter the purview of animal intellect, but it does not appear to rule out the possibility that this dimen sion, any more than such other moral dimensions as the weighing of moral dilemmas or guilt, may lie within the moral range of at least some animal species. The formidable task which cognitive ethology has set for itself is to de termine where, in the continuum of intellectual advancement that leads from the lowliest animal species to humankind, non-human species first begin to glimpse the concepts that contribute to the moral and intellectual universe in which humankind partakes so fully. Its conclusions to date re main highly controversial. Not even the most sophisticated discoveries of modern neuroscience have yet proven the assertion of some ancient the orists that animals possess religious sensibilities to which they seek to give expression. Nor, indeed, have they proven the assertion of others that they do not. Duquesne University 39- de Waal, op. cit. pp. 217-218. 40. de Waal, op. cit. p. 212.</page></plain_text>
