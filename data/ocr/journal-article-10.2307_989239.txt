He says that harmony or fitness (convenientia) "itself seeks equality and unity, either in the similarity of equal parts or in the gradation of unequal ones." In other words the arithmetical ratio in the window sizes provides a similarity or equality among the three windows because each shift in size is the same quantity. This holds for a three-story facade but not for a two-story one, since three is the minimum number of entities in such a ratio. He adds: "this true equality, similarity, and unity is apprehended not by the senses but by mental calculation" (mente intellecta). One does not simply see, but must measure and count. The horizontal rows of windows are similar; the vertical rows, if the facade is three stories high, are equal in that they vary equally; and since that equality is a constant, in this they have unity: they can be reduced to one. It is a truly Pytha- gorean conception. At this point I ask a question. Architec- tural historians, following Wittkower, have spent much time trying to discern mathe- matical series in room volumes and the like. Have they ever looked at facades in the way outlined above? When will distribution, hierarchy, dimension, and reduction become as important as proportion hunting in our interpretation of architecture ? These are the questions my book raises, and to which re- viewers should address themselves. All this passes Onians by. But if he is unin- structed as to the nature of Pythagoreanism he is doubly so as to its extent. Where the concepts just mentioned were commonplaces in Renaissance literature, and where tesserae (geometrical formations of dots), number- forms, and anthropomorphic dimensioning were equally well known, Onians claims that "almost the only Pythagorean element in any architectural text referred to" by me is Vitruvius's account of cubicae rationes. One hardly knows where to begin refuting this statement. It ignores, for one thing, the whole man-in-square-and-circle discussion in Vi- truvius III.i that is of the very essence of Pythagoreanism. This discussion becomes in turn a major theme in Vitruvius's immense Renaissance afterlife. One can go further: the differences between the temples Vitruvius knew and those demanded by his formulas are traceable to his desire to reduce them to a Pythagorean system. That the formulas lack, because of their wider central axis, "the abso- lute regularity necessary to Pythagorean- ism," as Onians says, is doubly false: i) they do not lack absolute regularity since a marked axis does not deprive a figure of that quality; z) absolute regularity (and here of course Onians means uniformity) is in any case not necessary to Pythagoreanism. There is no law against subgroups of tesserae. I re- spectfully suggest that if Onians were ac- quainted either with the classic literature of the subject, or with the modern writings of Heninger, Michel, Hopper, and others, he would have omitted almost all of what he says in his review (including the supposed contradictions and inconsistencies that he attributes to me but which, when they ac- tually exist, are to be found in the authors I cite). It would have become clear to him that there is no more need to prove the existence of Pythagoreanism in Renaissance architec- tural thought than to prove the positivism of Sigfried Giedion or the Christianity of St. Paul. Onians bases all this on my supposed in- ability to interpret texts. He tells his read- ers that I "manhandle," "creatively para- phrase," and "inflate" these texts; that (in a Ficinian flight of his own) "ideas are made to copulate with ideas until yet another pseudo- Pythagorean monster is born." However de- spite these incessant thunderings, Onians condescends to quote only one instance of such a misinterpretation. He chooses badly. He objects to my interpretation of the pas- sage (1.1.3) where Vitruvius talks about quod significat and quod significatur in architec- ture. In interpreting this passage Onians agrees with me; but he does not know he agrees with me because he does not under- stand what happens when quod significat is called a "signifier" and quod significatur a "signified." In modem usage this means that the process of signification is reciprocal. What is the signified, as opposed to what is the signifier, depends on whether you are building a temple or looking at one. If you are building a temple the formula signifies. The building is signified by the formula. If you are looking at the temple, the temple signifies and the formula is signified. In other words, it is the difference between saying, "Look at that Doric hexastyle temple" and saying "I am going to build a Doric hexa- style temple." Again, though I use the terms signified and signifier in the post-Saussurean sense, their particular application here is idiomatically Pythagorean. The onlooker reverses, by his scrutiny in accordance with number princi- ples, the process that the builder went through in designing the temple. As Ficino would say, the temple's equality, similarity, and unity cannot simply be seen but must be calculated first by the builder and then by the observer who comes along later and judges his work.

Figures i6, 17, and I8 are correctly captioned, but the illustra- tions above them should be changed: illus- tration i6 to caption 17; illustration 17 to caption I8; illustration 18 to caption I6.
