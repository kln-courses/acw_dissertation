Brown, Jr., and Kent H. Wilson. Scientific Publishers, Gainesville (Florida). $49.50 (hardcover); $24.50 (paper). 376 p.; ill.; systematic index to names of plants and animals mentioned, and subject index. ISBN: 0-945417-90-X (hc); 0-945417-91-8 (pb). 1994. Few works can boast the tremendous wealth and breadth of information compiled into this single volume. Through collaboration with those, past and present, most knowledgeable about the en- demic swallowtail butterflies of the Americas, the authors have assembled an impressive collection of data-intensive tables, figures, lists, maps, and text. These cover the topics of species identifica- tion, distribution, abundance, and evolution. In addition to this abundance of information, the au- thors have also included a hundred color plates, comprised of photos depicting swallowtail ecolo- gies, life histories and morphologies. "All but a handful of named subspecies and forms" (p. 20) are illustrated. With the inclusion of both juvenile and adult "FastKeys," this volume is an excellent reference source, as well as a functional species identification manual. Tyler, Brown, and Wilson have created an admirable work that will appeal to research scientists and laypersons alike. Given the significance of this book as a fairly exhaustive, albeit general, treatise, any shortcom- ings should be viewed as minor irritants. That said, few of the philosophical issues dealt with warrant the attention they are given. Attempts to inter- weave a philosophy of cultural tolerance and envi- ronmental conservation are clearly laudable. Other issues, however, seem overstated. With regard to other weaknesses, the prevalent use of anthropomorphic jargon, such as swallowtail "babies" (p. 115) and "stomping on his ladylove's thorax" (p. 54), detracted from an otherwise signifi- cant work. So too, the just-so-stories offered through-</page><page sequence="2">DECEMBER 1995 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 523 out the book to illustrate particular points or to rationalize certain behaviors. That predators and their prey do not escalate "to infinite velocity" (p. 53) would seem to have more to do with absolute genetic constraints, than "life/dinner principles" (p. 53). Finally, that the field of ecological genetics could be so narrowly defined as one that largely seeks to explain balanced polymorphisms (p. 143) is surprising. Indeed, this field is vast and might be better defined as one that, in general, seeks to discover the genetic phenomena that determine the distribution and abundance of populations. JANICE L.
