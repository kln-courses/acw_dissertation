<plain_text><page sequence="1">Royden Rabinowitch's work is uncom promisingly minimal. His last show at the Dowling Gallery, a selection of his metal 'manifolds', was thoroughly spartan but accessible in purely visual terms; this lean exhibition, four pieces of graphic work, was so devoid of aesthetic cues that I was driven to search out some written explana tions of his methodology. Without them I wouldn't have been able to formulate an adequate response. Thus a recapitulation may be in order. Rabinowitch, in about 1960, was struck by what he perceived as the impossibility of making anthropomorphic sculpture in the wake of David Smith's achievements, and came to the conclusion that 'what could be freshly made were constructions based on the intermediaries to the body - that is either architecture or landscape'. Donald Judd and Anthony Caro, he believed, were successfully pursuing those options. In order to create a new sculptural 'body', therefore, Rabino witch decided to apply himself to the problem of finding a way to make work that had 'an implied infinity of directions' - directions that would reveal themselves to an observer who took up a variety of locations around the sculpture. A first step towards this end was an in vestigation of the "physical conditions obscured by surfaces but nonetheless knowable through observation of the con struction", which, the artist observed, he knew about because of his ability to move in space. This led Rabino witch to consider 'somatic' properties ('somatic', according to Webster's dictionary, means 'corporeal, pertaining to the body'), and he came to define them as "closed/open and front/back; handed (i.e. right or left) quality; a sense of all directions, oblique, vertical and horizontal; total asymmetry through the axes, taking into consideration the internal asymmetry of the observer's body with its heart beating on the left; the top/bottom property, the top being dif ferent to the bottom". "I now thought" Rabino witch later wrote, "that if I could in clude these properties within a direct con struction, I would have an easily observ ed, fully articulated, internally determin ed body". His sculpture, based on these ideas, included pieces made out of oak barrels, which explored notions of inside/outside and the borders between the spaces; large greased cones, which drew attention to their invisible cavities and their surfaces; and hollow panels made of metal. In all of this work the observer's point of view was the starting point, and for the sculpture to have its desired effect the viewer had to move in space and time: the art was, in a sense, the sum of a theoretically infinite number of single views and remembered impressions. In 1973 Rabinowitch began to make 'manifolds' (Webster's: 'something in parts, but unified ). These were irregular polygons of sandblasted steel, bent and folded in complex ways; its lines, planes, and spaces provided a set of orientational instructions for the observer. The lines that structured the surfaces all radiated from one point, the uppermost point under which a hollow could be perceived under the folded surfaces. Each line led to a cor ner of one of the polygonal facets, which were all at different angles to each other, as they were to the floor of the room. Most of the manifolds had additions - steel plates affixed to their basic structure, which the artist called 'limits'. This sculpture, which was a kind of non anthropomorphic body, looked like a cross between a painting by Robert Mangold and a metal sculpture by Carl Andre. It was cool, stern, and distant, and like all good minimal/conceptual work it could take on another dimension if you chose to ponder its rationale, although you didn't need to know much about its intellectual genesis in order to enjoy its formal beauty. Rabinowitch's drawings and prints, however, are a different matter: you have to know the rules of the game to broach their impenetrability. The main piece in this exhibition, for instance, Somatic Con struction on a Vertical Plane in Seven Locations, was a set of seven identical lithographs, each composed of five grey lines. (The prints, made in 1978, came in an edition of ten; three are now in the National Gallery of Canada). They measured about twenty-four by thirty inches, and were hung around the main room of the gallery: there were three on the wall with the fireplace, two on the wall on the right a's you went in, and single pieces on the other two walls. They were all placed roughly at eye-level, only one print rather lower than the others, and there was approximately thirty inches bet ween the highest and the lowest. This was more or less a random formation; apparently they could have been hung anywhere in the room. The remaining three works were 'lemmas'(Webster's: 'secondary proposi tions demonstrated or assumed for the purpose of being used in the demonstra tion of some other proposition'); in other words, they were drawings with many of the characteristics of the metal manifolds. These were much larger than the prints, about six by four feet, and they appeared to have been drawn with a ball-point pen. Like the prints, they were made up of a handful of clear lines - horizontal, vertical, oblique, curved - and they were made bet ween 1978 and 1981. What, then, could be made of these pieces? With the benefit of some knowledge of the artist's intentions, it was possible to read them diagrammatically, looking for the somatic properties that are the foundation of his sculpture. And those properties were there for the finding, as was the altered perception that resulted from viewing the seven identical prints from a plurality of angles and distances. But it didn't amount to very much more than a sophisticated brain-teaser, and a fairly abstruse one at that. Reflexive art has its attractions, as does art that purports to lead the mind towards metaphysical discoveries, but it only really withstands prolonged attention if it is visually cap tivating. It was hard not to like these elegant puzzles if, like me, you have a temperamental inclination towards minimal art, but it would be just as difficult to argue convincingly that they were anything other than examples of cerebral whimsy. Besides, when the commercial factor was considered even the ludic com plexities seemed a trifle arbitrary. The Seven Locations of the first piece appeared to have been determined by the absence of the three prints that are in Canada, and a prospective buyer was not obliged to take all the rest. The minimum purchase was two. JOHN HUTCHINSON.</page></plain_text>
