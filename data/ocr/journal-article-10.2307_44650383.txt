Sivakumaran Wichita State Univ. ABSTRACT The aircraft seats facing bulkheads, interior walls, class dividers, lavatory, front seat back or instrument panels of aircraft have presented problems demonstrating the compliance with the Head Injury Criteria (HIC) requirement. Full scale sled tests provide means of assessing the response of the occupants and the potential head injuries in an aircraft crash which is extremely costly, time-consuming, and provide too much scatter on the HIC. These factors have motivated the Federal Aviation Administration, seat and airframe manufacturers as well as research providers such as the National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) to pursue alternative testing procedures to replace the full-scale sled tests. This paper presents the results of a series of baseline sled tests of the system seat/ATD/restraint/ bulkhead conducted at the NIAR horizontal sled which will be used to validate component test devices. Analytical approach including the nonlinear finite element modeling of the bulkhead as well as multibody modeling of the Hybrid II Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) were used for the design of simple energy absorbing bulkhead that would attenuate the HIC requirement. INTRODUCTION The manufacturers of aircraft seats and interiors have traditionally paid little attention to the crashworthi- ness performance of these components. Weight, space, optimization, comfort, and styling were the predominant design issue until 1984 when the GASP committee was formed to address the crashworthiness issues for general aviation aircraft [1]. The recommendation of this committee formed the basis for the Regulations (FARs) Part 23, 25, and 27 respectively for general aviation aircraft, transport aircraft, and rotorcraft [1-3]. In general the FARs define two distinct dynamic test conditions. The Test 1 condition is intended to evaluate the means to reduce the spinal loading and related injuries produced by the combined vertical /horizontal load environment typically generated by an aircraft crash event. Test 2 is intended to provide an assessment of the seat structural performance and the occupant restraint system in longitudinal direction. A top view of Test 2 is illustrated in Fig. 1. The Head Injury Criteria, HIC, is an empirical formula based on the Wayne State Tolerance Curve which is generally accepted as an indicator of the likelihood of severe head injury [4-6]. HIC is calculated as í 1 Ì25" HIC = (t,-f2H7 í 1 '[2a{t)dt' (1) U'i-'í)'1 «- -I max where, a(t) is the resultant acceleration of head e.g. in G's, t, is initial integration time in sec and t2 is the final integration time in sec for which the quantity in the bracket is maximized. A HIC value of 1000 has been established as the upper limit for protection against head impact injury as specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) [7] and FARs. Y »V Fig. 1 - FAR Test 2 condition The aviation industry is currently interested in identifying compliance methods to determine HIC, which are less expensive than full scale sled tests and the means to attenuate HIC. This has motivated a number of organizations including the FAA, the seat manufacturers, airframe manufactures, test labs, as well as research providers such as NIAR and Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) to pursue alternative (element) testing procedures to replace full-scale sled tests for this problem [8]. The candidate component test methods include the pendulum test, bowling ball drop test, and Boeing/mga/MTS linear head/neck impactor [9-10]. The element testing appears to be more controllable and thus more repeatable than full-scale tests, but more importantly, it reduces the number of test seats consumed during certification programs and is easier to setup. Hence, the component tests represent a significant opportunity to reduce the cost associated with demonstrating compliance with the HIC requirement. 89</page><page sequence="2">A series of baseline bulkhead tests using a seat/ ATD/bulkhead configuration were performed using rigid as well as energy absorbing bulkheads. This data will be used to correlate the component HIC tests to full-scale sled tests. Analytical tools such as MADYMO, MARC were used to predict the situation prior to the tests. FULL-SCALE SLED TESTS USING RIGID BULKHEAD TEST SETUP - The test setup consists of a rigid seat, rigid bulkhead, specially instrumented ATD, and data acquisition system shown in Fig. 2. A rigid seat frame was designed and fabricated from 2 in. square steel tubing. Two 1/8 inch thick aluminum plates served as seat back and seat bottoms which reduces the effect of seat cushion on the HIC. The geometry of the rigid seat is representative of a typical airliner economy class passenger seat with the seat back angle fixed in its most upright position. The seat represented a structure with no energy absorption capability, consequently all the energy of impact is transferred to the ATD representing a worst-case condition. Fig. 2 - Seat/ATD/Bulkhead test setup. The bulkhead fixture was fabricated from aluminum channel to support different panels. A thick 0.5 aluminum plate was used to produce a rigid barrier. This was chosen to form a baseline panel representing a worst-case scenario corresponding to a very stiff bulkhead. Thin 2024-O aluminum sheet panels were then used to produce HIC value in the acceptable range. Different types of foam padding, covered by cotton canvas, were attached to the aluminum plate with duct tape. A summary of the NIAR test equipment and data acquisition systems used for all ATD-bulkhead-sled tests is listed in Table 1. The head accelerometers were mounted in the ATD head center of gravity to provide the necessary data for determining HIC. A second set of accelerometers were mounted in the upper region of the head cavity as shown in Fig. 3 to provide for measurements of all six rigid body motions degree of freedom of the ATD head. The optical speed trap system was adjusted so that it triggered the high speed video system just prior to the start of the sled deceleration. The sled acceleration pulses were determined from two longitudinally sensing accelerometers that were mounted to the sled. Table 1 - Instrument and data acquisition systems.

A typical airline seat pitch of 35 inches was selected as a baseline distance for the seat/occupant/bulkhead test runs which matches the test setup employed by Gowdy and DeWeese [11-12]. The pitch distance is defined as the horizontal distance from the intersection between the seat back and the seat pan (referred to as seat reference point) and the outer surface of the foam material.

[13] 3 Unmodified General Plastic LAST-A-FOAM 2 lb/cu. ft. It is evident that the HIC produced in these baseline tests were much higher than the acceptable tolerance. Neither the panel nor the seat absorbed any energy of the impact and the padding foam could not absorb all the energy of the deceleration. To understand this phenomenon of whether it is possible to absorb all the energy of impact utilizing the pad only, analysis was conducted next. The analysis as it will be shown suggested that this is not a feasible solution. Hence, to reduce the HIC value to the acceptable range an energy absorbing panel were then designed and used for further tests. ANALYTICAL APPROACH FOR PADDING CRUSH REQUREMENT Studying the physical nature of HIC, it is possible to minimum determine the required crush as a function of impact speed, if the panel is made of an ideal crushable material . Such material is represented by a constant deceleration "a", where AV a = 77~ At (2) At g in which "AV" is the velocity change or the impact velocity, "At" is the duration of contact, and "g" is the gravitational acceleration. The velocity change "AV" would be linear for an ideal crushable material, and the maximum crush "Ax" can be determined by the area under the linear V-t diagram as 1 Ax = - AV At (3) 2 Eliminating AV from equations (2) &amp; (3) and substituting for "a(t)" in (1) for HIC results in Ax = AV8/3 (4) [s (HIC)2 g5 J For a particular HIC, the required crush "Ax" can be evaluated as a function of impact velocity "AV". More importantly, for an ideal crushable material, the minimum required crush "Ax" (in) as a function of impact velocity "AV" (ft/s) for a HIC 1000 can be determined as Ax = 1.84 (io)'4 AV8/3 (5) Fig. 5 - Minimum required crush as a function of impact velocity resulting in a HIC of less than 1000 for an ideal fully crushable material. As observed, for example, for impact velocity of 40 to 50 ft/Sec range, a minimum crush of 3.5 to 6.5 inch required to keep the HIC below 1000, if an ideal fully crushable pad is used. It is evident from this analysis that utilizing only the pad doesn't produce a feasible solution for protection of the head. This also explain the high HIC values obtained earlier from the baseline sled tests. Hence, an energy absorbing panel was then designed for HIC attenuation. DESIGN OF ENERGY ABSORBING BULKHEAD Different types of bulkhead construction have been considered for energy absorbing characteristics. A simple, easy to fabricate, and low cost design was preferred as the article would be destroyed after each tests. This bulkhead should decelerate the head upon impact in a crash environment in a way which attenuates the HIC value. Hence thin aluminum sheet was chosen and analyzed by MADYMO [14 ] and EasiMAD [ 15]. 91</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 6 - Simulation model with aluminum sheet panel. MADYMO MODEL DESCRIPTION - The model was designed to represent the seat/ATD/bulkhead test shown in Fig. 2. In this case the rigid seat was replicated by two stiff planes which remains fixed in space. These planes are specified as inertial planes in MADYMO. One plane served as the seat pan and the other seat back defined to represent the actual rigid seat shown in Fig. 6. The Hybrid II, 50th % ATD model was placed on the seat in same orientation as in the actual tests. A two point restraint system was defined to simulate polyester webbing (part no. 1108134-01, Pacific Scientific Co.) with a tensile strength of 3000 lb. The 2024-O aluminum sheet panels of different thickness were modeled as finite element entity and placed at the same position as in the case of actual tests. A constant pitch of 35 inch was maintained for all cases considered. The 2024-O aluminum was used for all the panels throughout the study except for one case where 2024-T3 was used. The result for this case produced a much higher HIC due to the higher yield strength. The stress-strain curves used in the model for Aluminum 2024-O and 2024-T3 [16] are shown in Fig. 7.

TEST CONDITION - The analysis were conducted using the pulse recorded during the test 96219-001. The peak sled deceleration pulse for this test was 16.7 G and the ATD head velocity at impact was 38.9 ft/sec. Sled deceleration plot for the specified test is shown in Fig. 8(a) along with straight line approximation. As the deceleration of the sled induces the same acceleration to the ATD, acceleration pulses on ATD are used in MADYMO simulation. The test conditions were simulated by acceleration pulses which are negative of the sled deceleration pulse. The acceleration pulse induced to the ATD for MADYMO simulation corresponding to sled test 96219-001 is shown in Fig. 8(b). Fig. 8 - (a) Actual Sled Deceleration Pulse, (b) Equivalent Acceleration Pulse for MADYMO Simulation MADYMO SIMULATION RESULTS - The output of the simulation was compared with actual sled test results to verify whether the acceleration pulse induced to the ATD can correctly simulate the head velocity at impact and head path. The head velocity at contact, predicted by the program for the specified test condition, was found to be 45.5 ft/sec compared to the head velocity at impact was measured in the test as 38.9 ft/sec. The head paths for the simulation and the actual test are shown in Fig. - 9. It was found that the MADYMO predicted head path and the actual sled test head path differ by no more than 2 inches.

This clearly shows that the thin aluminum sheet panel absorbed most of the impact energy during the deformation which in consequence lowered peak acceleration. But thick aluminum panel hardly deformed and absorbed impact energy which consequently resulted a high peak. Fig. 12 - Deformed Aluminum Sheet Panels.

SIMPLIFIED COMPONENT TESTING Due to the cost of the test articles and testing procedures as well as run time, the sled testing might be replaced by simplified component testing procedure. At present, the existing simplified HIC testing systems can be classified into three groups: drop tower setups, pneumatic setups, and pendulum setups. The CAMI "bowling ball" test setup [17], shown in Fig. 15, is a example of a drop tower setup, and it is the simplest type of setup. Here the ATD head or head form is raised to a required height and is then released, allowing the ATD head to strike the bulkhead or layers of padding material set on the ground. The CAMI "bowling ball" tests demonstrated that for some particular crush environments, it is possible to replace the full-scale sled tests wit this element test. However, the system cannot produce a pure component of velocity of the ATD head impact, and the configuration of the ATD head impact cannot be controlled. It has also been shown that the weight of the ball has large effect on HIC [17].

In the pneumatic category, the mga research corporation's "head/neck impactor " [9], Boeing "linear impactor" or the MTS head restraint testing system [10] should be mentioned. The mga's head/neck impactor is an inverted pendulum as shown in Fig. 16. It consists of an accelerator, pendulum arm, support arm, rebound brake system, dummy head/neck assembly, signal processing electronics, and a computerized control and data acquisition system. High pressure, dry nitrogen gas is used in the acceleration system. A calibrated Hybrid II or Hybrid III head neck assembly is mounted to the pendulum arm. This apparatus nearly replicates the motion of the ATD during full-scale sled tests. Fig. 16 - mga's head/neck impactor. The MTS head restraint testing system is a similar setup to mga . The reciprocating piston and cylinder run by a compressor, is used to accelerate the 94</page><page sequence="7">ATD head in a short distance as shown in Fig. 17. The impact velocity is controlled by regulating pressure trough valves. This type of systems occupy less space, is Fig. 17 - MTS head restrain system. more costly than other type of component testing devices, and can be used to establish localized HIC contours. The head-torso combined systems accelerates to the points of impact. However, a pure component of velocity of the ATD head impact can not be produced due to the short length of stroke. Fig. 18 - NIAR head strike test rig and mga (HSTR). The NIAR Head Strike Test Rig(HSTR) as shown in Fig. 18, is an example of pendulum type simplified HIC test setup. The system is gravity propelled, has a radius of 22 feet, and is capable of attaining a velocity of 53 ft/s at its tip. The system is fabricated from aluminum C-channel to be both light weight and strong enough to withstand high stress due to impact. The system has an arrester mechanism, a locking mechanism, and a set of shock absorbers. Any desired value of impact velocity can be obtained by suitably adjusting the inclination angle of the pendulum, and letting it fall freely under the action of gravity. VALIDATION OF SIMPLIFIED HIC TESTING PROCEDURE - Early attempts by CAMI and mga have shown some validation for the bowling ball drop test and the Head/Neck assembly test. A number of further tests need to be conducted utilizing all the component test devices to validate the component HIC test devices. In particular, the results produced by the base line full-scale sled tests, presented here, must be compared or correlated with the component testing devices. By this means component testing devices can be validated which might consequently replace the costly, time consuming full-scale sled tests. CONCLUSION The problem of head impact protection of occupants was considered, which has caused difficulties in the compliance with the Head Injury Criteria by most seat and airframe manufactures. Full-scale sled tests of the system of ATD/ Seat / restraint/ bulkhead as well as analysis codes including nonlinear finite element analysis of energy absorbing bulkhead and multibody modeling of Hybrid II ATD were utilized in this study. It was shown that it would physically neither possible nor feasible to absorb the energy of the head impact with foams or pads mounted on stiff bulkheads. Whereas energy absorbing bulkheads utilizing 2 to 3 inches of crush of the back panel seem to be a reasonable solution for the head impact onto bulkhead problems in order to keep the HIC below 1000. In addition, component test devices need to be studied further to utilize the simplicity, speed and cost effectiveness of these test procedures. REFERENCES 1.
