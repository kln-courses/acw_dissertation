<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAUSALITY Y. I. KIRIKORIAN THE image of nature as causality has been a major theme of science and poetry. It has been a symbol of hope and fear, of progress and futility. Yet its meaning has seldom been clear. Prior to any state- ment about the relation of causality to physical nature, life, and mind, its meaning should be established. I shall therefore first define causality, and I shall then discuss its applicability to nature. I Causality, like all other types of explanation, is a correlation of given phenomena. To understand the nature of causality, therefore, two questions need to be answered: (I) What are the characteristics of causal relation? (2) What are the properties of causal entities? These two questions are only relatively independent of one another. In our final interpretation of causality the two questions should not be too sharply separated, since the characteristics of entities and of relations are exhibited in their interrelations. I. Causal Relation.-The simplest procedure to determine the nature of causal relation will be to analyse the major characteristics of instances of the causal order. There are different types of order or process. Certain processes are called causal, others casual, and still others purposive. Instances of causal order would be the following: fire melts ice; water quenches fire; bodies gravitate towards one another; a billiard ball strikes another, and the second ball moves. In more precisely stated instances of the causal order one observes that at a given temperature the volume of a given quantity of gas varies inversely as the pressure it sustains, and that the strength of an electric current varies directly as the electromotive force and inversely as the resistance. There are three characteristics of the above instances of causal relation which are of special importance for the present discussion. Causal relation is non-anthropomorphic, it exhibits uniformity, and is deterministic. In causal explanation, whether one considers the relations or the entities, anthropomorphism is eliminated. Causal relation is a name for a certain type of order of events, and not a name for the activity of an agency behind events. Causal correlation does not disprove purposes, ends, or wishes, but simply disregards them. It may very 319</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY well be, as great historic religions and idealistic systems have claimed, that the anthropomorphic interpretation of nature is a more funda- mental and truthful one, and that anthropomorphism gives a deeper insight into the nature of things than causality; but this claim does not alter the fact that while limited to causal correlations one should not refer to wish, desire, and purpose. The second characteristic of causal relation is uniformity. Causality refers primarily to the constant features of the given phenomena. The illustrations of causality which were mentioned earlier are all statements of uniformities or constant features which exist between phenomena. The uniformities of causal relations, however, do not deal with the universe as a whole but with specific processes under certain limited conditions. Before one can determine a specific causal relation there must be an isolated system within which it holds. The isolated system may be very broad, as the one in the first law of motion, which includes every particle of matter under all conditions; or it may be more restricted, as in the second law of motion, which is limited to bodies falling under specific conditions. But whether the scope of isolation should be broad or narrow, causal relation applies to limited spheres. There is no causal relation between the infinite whole and its parts. Causality refers to a relation between one part and another.I It should also be noted that uniformity or constant relations are sought in terms of numerical relations. In ordinary experience, and in the eaily stages of a science, the described uniformities are of a general character, such as that all unsupported bodies fall, fire burns paper, etc.; but causal explanation, in its advanced stages, is not content with such vague statements of uniformities. The uniformities which are sought are the ones which can be correlated with precise, numerical relations. A third characteristic which has often been associated with causality is the concept of determinism or necessity. This third trait of causality has been violently criticized. From Hume to Russell it has been a common contention that necessity is a fiction and that causality merely means invariable connection of uniformity of processes. For the present, without analysing the objections raised to the necessity or determinism of causal relations, I shall limit myself to brief comments on the meaning of necessity, and on the specific sense of necessity in the causal relation. Though necessity, or determinism, should be a fiction or a myth, it is certainly not a meaningless concept. Hume, who presents the most effective objections to the concept of necessity, was quite certain that the concept had a meaning, since otherwise his criticisms would have been of no importance. What then is necessity? Briefly, necessity refers to deductive systems where from self-evident, postu- ' S. Alexander, Space, Time and Deity, vol. i, p. 288. 320</page><page sequence="3">CAUSALITY lated, or "convenient" concepts other concepts are derived. The clearest illustration of the notion of necessity is the concept of classes where the implicative relation is that of inclusion, or that of from species to genus. Causal relations are deterministic in the sense that cause and effect contain implicative relations. Causal laws connect the elements of experience in terms of some logical or mathematical pattern, and these mathematical patterns are fundamentally assertions of mutual implications between the parts of an equation. Causal laws assert something more than the sequence of events. Day follows night, but we never consider night to be the cause of day. Or cloven-footed- ness is co-existent with ruminance, but we never interpret this co-existence in terms of causal relation. In causality there is the assumption that a given result is due to, or is determined by, the existence of some other factor. This factor is the principle of identity. To say that the same thing may act on the same thing under the same conditions, yet produce different effects, is to say that a thing need not be what it is. But this is an untenable position. For a thing to be at all it must be something, and it can only be what it is. When we assert that there is necessity or determinism between A and X, what we mean to say is that A acts as it does because it is what it is.I 2. Causal Entities.-Most liberally, causal entities may be defined as perceptual entities. Causality begins with perceptual experience and attempts to make it intelligible. The entities of this stage may be called the pre-analytic entities.z The pre-analytic entities of causality are the events of the perceptual world. These events offer problems. How does wood float? How does reproduction occur? What is the nature of the movement of the heavenly bodies? Another way of stating the pre-analytic stage of causal entities is to consider them as the elements of nature, when nature means that which is "disclosed in sense-perception,"3 and when at the same time it is assumed that nature is something that can be thought of as "a closed system whose mutual relations do not require the expression of the fact that they are thought about."4 It is usual, however, to define the perceptual diversities as physico-chemical entities. This second stage is the post-analytic stage of causal entities. Is it possible to frame a definition of causal entities to include various kinds of entities? To select any one of them would be rather arbitrary. What is necessary is to present the most general traits of the different kinds of causal entities. I H. W. B.

Whitehead, The Concept of Nature, p. 4. 4 Ibid., p. 3 X 321</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY First of all, causal entities, both the pre-analytic and the post- analytic types, have their status within the space-time continuum. Causal entities are not purely logical entities; they are existences, that is to say, they can be located in space and dated in time. The spatio-temporal habitat of causal entities differentiates them from other types of entities, such as the logical or psychical. What, then, does status within the space-time continuum mean ? For the present we need not settle the question whether space-time categories should be interpreted in terms of the absolute theory or the relational theory; nor is it necessary to determine the further metaphysical question whether space-time is, as Whitehead holds, merely an abstraction from events, or, as Alexander argues, the stuff of which all finite things are made. It is sufficient to say that causal entities have position in the space-time continuum. An example of spatial position would be: A is to the left of B. An example of temporal position would be: A stands in the relation of simultaneity or succession to B.I Causal entities require a system of reference; and whatever one's theory of space-time might be, these categories are taken to be a system of reference; and this is what is important for the present discussion. Causal entities, in the second place, are physical quantities. By quantity, I do not mean the unchanging reals of the classic physics, but rather entities which are sufficiently constant to have numbers assigned to them by measurement. Causal explanation is functional correlation between variable physical quantities (numbers). Causal entities are therefore measurable. There are, of course, different theories as to what the fundamental physical quantities are. In the traditional mechanical theory of nature the physical quantity was the mass; in the electrodynamic theory it is the electric charge, or the electromagnetic field. The question as to how the property of the physical quantity represented by mass differs from the property of the physical quantity represented by charge is unanswerable in terms of immediate experience. Operationally, however, the dif- ference between matter and electricity is that "the number called the mass of a body is assigned by methods which differ from those by which the number called the charge is assigned, and the mass and electric charge enter into different functional relations with other quantities."z Causal entities as physical quantities are symbols represented by matrices. Causal entities exclude, therefore, vitalistic or non-physical entities; but they should be interpreted with suffi- cient breadth to include heterogeneous physical entities. A definition of causality can now be made. In a most general way causality is a type of explanation which employs only functional I V. F. Lenzen, Physical Theory, pp. 50-84. 2 Ibid., p. 283. 322</page><page sequence="5">CAUSALITY correlations and only physico-chemical entities. Should one prefer a more specific statement about the nature of causal relations and causal entities, the definition of causality would be the following: causality is constituted in the non-anthropomorphic, uniformitarian, and deterministic correlations between sets of entities which are physical quantities within the space-time continuum. II In the preceding section the meaning of causality was analysed. We now come to another problem related to causality. Is causality applicable to nature? The question concerns the ontological status of causality. To claim the applicability of causality to nature is meaningless unless we can verify our claims. At the present stage of experimental science it is impossible to verify the universal applicability of causality. One has to wait with patience for this verification, should such a stage ever arrive. In absence of empirical verification, however, it is possible to strengthen the case for causality by meeting some of the arguments against it. This method is at best an indirect one. I shall not discuss all the possible objections to causality. Such an attempt would mean practically the rewriting of the history of philosophy from Anaxagoras to Whitehead. I shall limit the discussion to two current arguments raised against causality. For convenience the first may be called the argument from history, and the second the argument from uniformities of natural laws as statistical. I. History.-The general claim of the argument from history is that causal or scientific knowledge presents merely a description or abstraction, whereas historical or appreciative knowledge gives a concrete insight and understanding of reality. Causality is, at best, only a useful and practical scheme in dealing with experience. "The world of appreciation is the . . . deeper reality," writes Royce. "Its rival, the world of description, is the result of essentially human finite outlook."I Scientific description is necessary, but abstract and inadequate; but as it is "anybody's world" it gives unity to expe- rience. To make our description valid for all human beings, the fashions of causal or scientific description have to be universal. We cannot describe, however, "the unique, e.g. Shelley's 'sense that at the winds of spring,' etc. That we have to appreciate."2 For Ward, too, it is history not science or mechanism which can give us reality in its concreteness. "With the experience in the concrete, we can deal satisfactorily in no other way," writes Ward, "and no competent thinker dreams of interpreting the history of the world by means The Spirit of Modern Philosophy, p. 411. 2 Ibid., p. 398. 323</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY of a scheme of universal laws."I In history "we find no mere repe- tition, no absolute fixity, small scope for measurement or for mathe- matics, the indispensables of all scientific conception; yet, though affording thus little foothold for positive and exact science, the historical is what we understand best and what concerns us most."2 The claim of the argument from history does not seem to me a well-founded doctrine. It may be granted that existing beings, animate and inanimate, are individuals, that they are concrete and unique. This belief, however, need not lead one to a sharp separation between the historic and the causal types of knowledge. All sig- nificant assertions about the individual or the concrete are in terms of universals and abstractions. No historical knowledge can possibly dispense with the disparaged abstractions. Take any historical event which is individual, unique, and unrepeatable, such as the invasion of Russia by Napoleon. Each incident and happening in this cam- paign, such as Napoleon's march through Poland, his encounter with Russians at Borodino, the setting on fire of Moscow by Russians before Napoleon's entrance, the enormous loss of men in the cam- paign, etc., is unique and unrepeatable. All these happenings, how- ever, are described in terms of concepts and universals. Apart from universals, such as "encounter," "fire," "entrance," "loss," terms which are applicable to many other situations, the understanding of these unique events would be impossible. The proposition that reality is historic, individual, concrete should not be identified with the untenable doctrine that the individual is real apart from concepts or abstractions. On the other hand, scientific knowledge, which is discredited because of its abstractions, does not dispense with the concrete or the individual. The aim of natural science is to understand the nature of the actual world, and not to construct the laws of all possible worlds. The geologist who is trying to determine and analyse the various stages of the evolution of the earth is dealing with something which is specific, unique, and individual. The incidents here are almost as unrepeatable as Napoleon's Russian campaign. In a more limited sense, the same is true with the physicist. The physicist in his laboratory experiments with individual objects. The fact that he is interested in laws, or causal connections, should not lead one to the belief that he has no concern with the individual or the concrete. The discovered laws are laws of specific realms of existence. It should also be noted that the historian, not unlike the scientist, is engaged in determining certain uniformities and laws of the human race. The acceptance or rejection of alleged facts, the weighing of evidence, is often determined in terms of these laws. In this respect I Naturalism and Agnosticism, vol. II, p. 280. 2 Ibid., p. 280. 324</page><page sequence="7">CAUSALITY the method of a critical historian is very similar to that of an exact scientist.I Yet one might agree on one point with Ward's and Royce's con- tention. It might be reasonably held that the same situation or object may be described from different points of view. Logicians have been long conversant with the peculiarities of the principles of classification, of which many are available for arranging objects of our experience. The smallest book in size in one's library may be the biggest in value. An object may exhibit different charac- teristics through its relation to different types of classification. To claim, as the materialists do, that existence should be classified only in terms of one fundamentum divisionis, namely, causality, shows, to say the least, a lack of metaphysical imagination. It is much more fruitful to assume the possibility of a number of principles of classification, and to determine in terms of empirical verification which are most relevant, fruitful, and enlightening in their appli- cation to experience. An object may be a model of causality, yet at the same time exhibit characteristics of purpose. In a situation like this there is no necessity to consider causality as appearance, or as merely practical. Causality is an objective aspect of existence, though existence may have other aspects. 2. Uniformities as Statistical Averages.-As a second objection to causality it is argued that the uniformities expressed in laws are only approximately exemplified, and never with rigid exactness. The relations between phenomena are constant in the sense that they hold within very narrow limits. We have no warrant, it is claimed, for saying that they are absolutely constant. The so-called uniformities of nature are only statistical averages. The actual course of events may conform to these uniformities within certain limits, but to claim absolute uniformity is to go beyond empirical knowledge. The ground for the view that uniformities are of the statistical type is based first of all on the fact that the so-called rigid, causal relations are never verified in our experience. Taylor, for example, points out that "the undeviating conformity of the actual course of any concrete process to scientific law 'cannot be verified as an empirical fact by observation or experiment.'2" Similarly, Royce writes: "What we verify are more or less permanent rules relating to the routine of nature phenomena. In other words, our common experience discovers states, more or less persistent."3 Secondly, it is pointed out that the view that uniformities of nature are only statistical averages is strengthened by the con- sideration of the actual method of the scientists. In many cases, I M. R. Cohen, Reason and Nature, pp. I2-I5. 2 Elements of Metaphysics, p. 223. 3 The World and the Individual, vol. ii, p. i86. 325</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY if not in all, uniformities have been obtained by statistical method. The measurements of molecules are all made in bulk. What is really measured is "the combined effect of millions, or it may be of billions, of molecules."' As we cannot deal with individual atoms but only with the aggregate or bulk, the fluctuations, if very small, are con- sidered as non-existent. The physicist, like the sociologist, is confined to the statistical method. The only difference between the two is that the former deals with less striking individuals. It is interesting to observe that the doctrine that nature is rela- tively indetermined and that the uniformities of nature are only statistical, a view which would have been violently criticized by most of the physicists not many years ago, is a fashionable and popular doctrine since the recent developments of the quantum theory. Eddington, for example, writes: "It is a consequence of the advent of the quantum theory that physics is no longer pledged to a scheme of deterministic law."2 Similar views are expressed by Weyl, Heisenberg, and Reichenbach, to mention but a few. One suspects that the willingness of the modern mind to accept the doctrine that nature is indetermined is not solely based on the consideration of facts, nor mainly on the traditional motives for making place for God, freedom, and immortality. Our age dislikes strict laws of all types. We dislike strict laws in government, in morality, and in aesthetics. Our emotional lives are chaotic for innumerable reasons: we love primitive dances, unintelligible poetry, bizarre paintings, noisy music, and vague concepts. It is not strange, therefore, that we should also carry the same attitude into our descriptions of nature. A chaotic and indeterminate nature would be in harmony with chaotic and indeterminate experience. I do not mention these considerations to discard the doctrine I am con- sidering. I admit the possibility that nature may be relatively, or wholly if one likes, indeterminate and chaotic. I see no reason for the impossibility of the doctrine. It should be noted, however, that the claim that uniformities are ultimately statistical is not a verified fact, but rather a certain interpretation of certain accepted facts. The very same facts have a different possible interpretation. That measurements and physical comparisons are never exact, that uniformities have been attained by statistical methods, and that the invariant relations have never been completely verified, are facts which one should admit readily; these facts, however, are explicable without the denial of causality. The inexactness of measurements and physical comparisons may be due not to any indeterminism in nature but to the lack of finer instruments or precise formulation of the physical problems; in short, to the lack x Ward, Naturalism and Agnosticism, vol. i, p. 0oo. 2 The Nature of the Physical World, p. 294. 326</page><page sequence="9">CAUSALITY of knowledge. Even in the quantum theory, where, at the present stage of its development, the very nature of the problem demands the principle of indeterminacy, as the simultaneous determination of the momentum and of the position of the electrons are impossible, it should be noted that indeterminacy does not mean indeterminism in the sense of uncaused happening, but rather in the sense of immeasurability. As Turner points out, the implications of Heisen- berg's principle of indeterminacy are often confused, owing to the ambiguity of the expression to "determine."' Determinism usually means "unvarying causation." In the principle of indeterminacy "to determine" means not "to cause," but simply "to ascertain." There is no conflict whatsoever between causality and the use of the statistical method. In physics, for example, the statistical method was first developed to deal with problems related to micro- scopic entities. Although molecules may be causally determined, recourse is made to the statistical method because of the crudity of our senses and the complexity of mathematical problems. Simi- larly, in meteorology and in social sciences complexities demand the use of the statistical method. Here again one need not forgo causality. Though the traits of the group are described by statistical laws, variations may have specific causal connections, and one may gradually ascertain these connections. Theoretically we must admit the possibility that the ultimate laws of nature may be statistical. Causality, however, is equally com- patible with the given facts, and pragmatically preferable. If statis- tical laws are ultimate, there is then no theoretical reason to find the causes of variation; but progress has been attained by looking for the causal connection of these variations.
