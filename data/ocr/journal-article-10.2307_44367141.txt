<plain_text><page sequence="1">JERZY KOSINSKI'S STEPS AND THE CINEMATIC NOVEL by Byron Petrakis Before American novelist Jerzy Kosiński arrived in the United States from Poland in 1957, he was a prize-winning photographer whose photographs, he told interviewer Jerome Klinkowitz, "were exhibited at more international exhibitions than anybody else's in Eastern Europe"1 While in Poland, Kosiński also studied "the history and theory of film for two years at the Lodz Film School" (p. 165) with his friend Roman Polański, the internationally acclaimed film director. In view of his background, it is not surprising that Kosiński has discussed cinema's impact on narrative art. In The Art of the Self originally published as a companion piece to his novel Steps (1968), he has recognized in the cinematic montage a way of organizing the narrative episodes in Steps to suggest the fragmented nature of the modern consciousness. "Episodes display their symbolism when worked into montage," Kosiński writes, "through which they establish patterns, while preserving the memory of a master symbol. Montage reflects the modern thought process. . . . The cinematic image has become the key to modern perception. It has created a new relationship between visual perception and emotion." 2 By cinematic montage, Kosiński seems to mean both sequences of carefully edited images used to suggest the lapse of chronological time and the arrangement of these images into symbolic patterns. Kosinski's background in photography and film and his development as a novelist have made him aware not only of the potential for applying the techniques of one medium to another, but also of the possibilities and limitations inherent in the visual arts. Like the fiction of the French New Novelists, Kosinski's novels are highly sensitive to the world of surfaces filtered through the consciousness of his protagonists. As a novelist of ideas, however, Kosiński is more interested in what his protagonists think and know than in what they see. His achievement as a novelist is his ability to exploit cinematic techniques without confining himself to these techniques and without sacrificing the written word's ability to treat both concrete objects and abstract philosophical ideas with ease. In Stepsy Kosiński approximates the effect of the cinematic montage by organizing brief episodes, containing striking visual descriptions, around "master symbols" to suggest transitions in the protagonist's constantly changing quest for self. At the same time, he not only utilizes literature's ability to present abstract philosophical ideas, but also exploits language's connotative and metaphorical function. Kosiński is thus able to evoke shades of meaning that the cinema, based upon the esthetic of the explicit photographic image, cannot so readily convey. In the Klinkowitz interview, Kosiński suggests that the explicitness of the photographic image inhibits him from utilizing the desirable ambiguity of language. As a writer, he does not envy the photographer's ability to reproduce reality by developing in the darkroom a perfect reproduction of the image in his mind when he took the picture. His own words are 16</page><page sequence="2">instructive : With writing I can only approximate the vision I have. I can only encode it, and by encoding I'm sending a cable through an abstract messenger to an unkown receptor. ... I assume that my using the language connects me and my readers. . . in the most profound of ways, but I'm not giving my reader every detail of black and white, or of Kodacolor, with all the shadows in between. I am merely pointing out the tree in the field. Whether my reader will "see" the field or a tree or my intent to show them in a certain manner is something I will never know. How he will see it and what it will mean to him will remain, for me, a mystery. This is why I think I would never be able to go back to visual arts of any kind; even if I write nothing but telephone books and list names and phone numbers, they would still have for me greater evocative power than the best of my photographs (P. 148). Kosinski's views on language's connotative function, particularly its ability to evoke varying responses in the reader, are not shared by Alain Robbe- Grillet and many of the French New Novelists who have been influenced by him. On the other hand, we shall see that Kosinski's fiction does display some tendencies which can be described as cinematic in Robbe-Grillet's sense of the term. Because it draws upon his career as a spokesman of the nouveau roman movement, as well as a novelist, screenwriter, and filmmaker, Robbe-Grillet's discussion of new directions in the novel provides a useful context for examining the extent to which Steps is a cinematic novel and for exploring some aspects of the relationship between Kosinski's novel and modern cinema in general. While discussing links between modern fiction and film in his well-known essays on fiction entitled For a New Novel,3 Robbe-Grillet contends that the cinema's treatment of time in "the present tense of the indicative" approximates the novel's treatment of time since Proust and Faulkner to the extent that "film and novel today meet in the construction of moments, of intervals, and of sequences which no longer have anything to do with those of clocks or calendars."4 Robbe-Grillet further suggests that the novel of the future could profit from the cinema's projection of surfaces in order to reflect more accurately the "less anthropocentric" modern world (p. 29). In his words, "the world is neither significant nor absurd. It is, quite simply. . . . Around us, defying the noisy pack of our animistic or protective adjectives, things are there. Their surfaces are distinct and smooth, intact, neither suspiciously brilliant nor transparent" (p. 19). He particularly distrusts the use of figurative language to provide links between the world of objects and any kind of philosophical vision. "Metaphor," he claims, "is never an innocent figure of speech" (p. 53). For Robbe-Grillet, "these anthropomorphic analogies are repeated too insistently. . . not to reveal an entire metaphysical system" (p. 53). Accordingly, Robbe-Grillet argues that "literary language" must change from utilizing "words of a visceral, analogical, or incantatory character" to reliance upon "the word that contents itself with measuring, locating, limiting, defining" (p. 24). Reliance upon such denotative language, he 17</page><page sequence="3">predicts, "indicates a difficult but most likely direction for a new art of the novel" (p. 24). Robbe- Grill eťs fiction and his cinematic career exemplify many of his theoretical principles. Instantanés (Paris: Les Editions de Minuit, 1962), his collection of short sketches translated as Snapshots in the book's American edition (New York: Grove Press, Inc., 1968), illustrates the importance he attaches to photographic reproduction of objects rather than their transformation into metaphor and symbol. "The Dressmaker's Dummy," one of the brief sketches in his Snapshots collection, brings into sharp focus his attempt to depersonalize his fictional world in favor of manikins. His stress upon objects is further reflected in his script for Alain Resnais' controversial Last Year at Marienbad (1961), a film whose apparent obsession with objects underscores the attempt of New Novelists and New Wave filmmakers alike to both demythologize and depersonalize modern cinema as well as modern fiction. In the same year that Marienbad was released as a film, Robbe- Grillet published it in book form as a " ciné-roman " or "film novel." His subsequent ciné-romans , L'immortelle (1963) and Glissements Progressifs du Plaisir (1974), as well as the films he has directed himself, attest to his gradual and unsurprising transition from literature to film. The differences between Kosiński 's and Robbe- Grillet 's views on language should not, however, obscure the characteristics which Kosinski's fiction does share with modern film and the cinematic novels of the nouveau roman writers. More so than his other fiction, Steps -- Kosinski's second novel and winner of a National Book Award-displays similarities to the French New Novel, particularly in its treatment of time and its stress upon surfaces. The structure of Steps is highly fragmented, with the fragments organized around the experience of an unnamed protagonist whose constantly changing identity does not permit the reader to define him simply in terms of a single role or occupation. (Robbe-Grillet's fiction, with its unnamed characters, illustrates his contention that "the novel of characters belongs entirely to the past, it describes a period: that which marked the apogee of the individual").5 A flow of striking images, evidence of Kosinski's strong visual orientation, conveys his vision of a morally disoriented, decadent society in which the protagonist searches futilely to define himself in terms of his relationships with others. With its fragmented structure, indifference to chronological time, and richness of visual description, Steps is particularly well-suited for the adaptation of cinematic techniques-especially the montage-to prose fiction. While Kosinski's novel exhibits characteristics of the New Wave cinema and the nouveau roman described and created by Robbe-Grillet, it transcends the limitations imposed by the French writer's version of the new aesthetic by utilizing such conventional narrative elements as dialogue and character and by exploiting rather than de-emphasizing the connotative and symbolic functions of language. Kosinski's use of these traditional elements of fiction reveals a significant difference in philosophical thrust from the nouveau roman writers. As Samuel Coale has perceptively pointed out, Kosiński "is not interested solely in re-creating the experience of a constantly changing and changeable world of surfaces. . . . His protagonists. . .desire to know more" ["The Cinematic 18</page><page sequence="4">Self of Jerzy Kosiński," Modern Fiction Studies (Autumn 1974), 365]. Unlike Robbe- Grillet 's disdain in For a New Novel for " anthropomorphic analogies" and his dismissal of "character" as an "obsolete notion" (p. 27), Kosinski's concern is with the significance of the individual in his efforts to know himself and cope with the meaninglessness of modern industrialized society. Kosinski's ability to utilize innovations in form to convey man's confrontation with the emptiness of modern life and his philosophic vision of contemporary man's violation of himself link him more closely to novelists of ideas like Camus and filmmakers like Bergman or Fellini than to Robbe- Grillet. Steps , which Kosinki published after his first, and still most famous novel, The Painted Bird (1965), develops the main idea central to all of his writing-the relationship between the individual and the group in modern industrialized society. In Steps , as in The Painted Bird , Kosiński is concerned with the group's alteration of the individual's humanness through overt violence, but his second novel focuses more sharply upon such subtler forms of violence as the bureaucratic organization of life. The attempt of Steps* protagonist to define himself is unsuccessful because of his obsession with trying to prove to others that he has a self separate from their image of him. In his efforts to prevent others from manipulating him, however, he is constantly manipulating them to see him as he wants to be seen. His attempts to manipulate others, moreover, mimic the dehumanizing effect of the forces of modern, industrialized society on the individual. In attempting to avoid the influence of the machine on his own self, Kosinski's protagonist ironically imitates its mechanistic behavior in his interpersonal relations. The result is that he treats others-and ultimately himself-like machines, thereby further contributing to his own alienation. In order to convey his theme of the violation of the self in modern society, Kosiński relies heavily upon striking visual imagery to form sequences or patterns whose movement throughout the novel approximates the fluidity of the filmic montage. Kosinski's use of the octopus image in Steps illustrates his discussion in The Art of the Self about organizing episodic montages or patterns around a central "master symbol." Early in the novel, the protagonist observes an octopus in an aquarium feeding "on live crabs, fish, mussels-and on itself. It nibbled at its own tentacles, consuming them one after another."0 Building upon his brief surface description of the octopus, and in direct contrast to Robbe- Grillet's distrust of metaphor, Kosiński transforms it into a powerful image conveying both the suicidal and destructive impulses of contemporary life. After being told that "the octopus was slowly killing itself," we also learn that "in the part of the world where it had been caught, an octopus was believed to be a god of war, prophesying defeat when it looked landward and victory when it looked seaward; this particular specimen. . . had only looked landward when captured" (p. 22). Like the jaded characters in the beach scene from Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1959) who do not recognize in the bloated fish a symbol of the decadent satiety of their lives, Kosinski's protagonist fails to see the self-destroying octopus as symbolic of his moral suicide, despite the several actual suicides in the novel. Unable, moreover, to recognize in the octopus 19</page><page sequence="5">a symbol of his own sadomasochistic behavior, the protagonist soon loses interest in it and focuses upon the other spectators at the aquarium. After observing that some of them "shuddered" while watching the octopus feed upon itself and that others "were impassive," he notices "a young woman staring at the octopus without any apparent reaction, her lips relaxed. There was a serenity about her that went beyond unconcern" (p. 22). He meets the woman, manages to get invited to a dinner party at her home, and easily arranges a rendezvous with her in the capital city of a neighboring country. Although she is anxious to grant his wishes once they are alone, his sudden impotence frustrates their mutual desire for physical intimacy. Bewildered by his impotence and anxious to assert his manhood, the protagonist attempts to reassure himself by picking up a prostitute, only to discover that his partner, who has been successfully stimulating him, is a transvestite. Kosinski's descriptions in the two pages in which all of this action takes place are brief and highly visual, moving with the unbroken continuity of a cinematic montage from the self- destroying octopus, to the relaxed woman staring at it, to the protagonist's conversation with her, to the dinner party at their home, to their rendezvous at the hotel, and finally to his picking up the transvestite. Kosinski's description of the protagonist's encounter with the transvestite is reminiscent of the visual descriptions permeating Robbe- Grillet's fiction: "On the street I approached a woman: Her face was thickly painted and the shape of her figure lost in an ill-fitting dress" (p. 24). Yet Kosiński does not content himself with surface description, as becomes evident when the protagonist suddenly realizes that his partner is a man: "My mood altered abruptly. I felt the longing for pleasure and abandonment inside me, but I also sensed that I had been accepted too readily, that everything had suddenly become very predictable. All we could do was to exist for each other solely as a reminder of the self" (p. 24). The belief of the natives that the octopus was a "god of war" is particularly relevant to the violation of the self in Steps. Kosinski's second novel shares with his first graphic descriptions of brutal, physical violence. No less pervasive, however, are the numerous examples in Steps of "invisible violence," the everyday attempts to psychologically manipulate and control others. The octopus god of war even manifests itself in the relationship between the sexes, so entangling lovers in its tentacles that attempts to find oneself through physical intimacy end in futility. This is evident in the episode where the protagonist, in the role of a ski instructor, preys upon a vulnerable sanatorium patient. His predatory plan for an easy conquest is frustrated, however, when the dying woman chooses to make love to the image of his body reflected in her mirror instead of to him. The rapid deterioration of her health during their relationship suggests: that she is a préfiguration of the octopus as a symbol of sadomasochism. In order to reinforce still further the reader's memory of the octopus as a master symbol, Kosiński presents "the woman in the cage episode" in the form of a montage, thus conveying once again his idea of self- alienation resulting from sadomasochistic behavior. By means of structuring apparently unconnected fragments of his protagonist's experience in the form of montages reinforcing his master symbol, 20</page><page sequence="6">Kosiński approximates the practice of Fellini in La Dolce Vita. There Fellini depends upon the basic rhythm of syncopation to create from disparate filmic sequences a unified vision of social decay. Coming upon a demented woman kept suspended in a cage in a village barn, the protagonist's characteristic first reaction is that he and the woman "were alone in the barn and that she was totally defenseless" (p. 86). He is tempted to exploit this helpless creature, as he did the sanatorium patient, reflecting that "in this situation. . . one could become completely oneself with another human being" (p. 86). Preventing him from acting upon his sadistic impulse is not any respect for the woman's already maligned humanity, but his realization that in her deranged condition she could not satisfy the sadistic pleasure with which he seems obsessed: "What I required, however," he reflects, "was the other's recognition of this: the woman in the cage could not acknowledge me" (p. 86). In his graphic image of the caged woman with "her pock-marked face, her gnawed fingernails, her emaciated thighs stippled with bluish bruises" (p. 86), Kosiński once again goes beyond mere surface description by providing his readers with a human analogue to the self-consuming octopus. The woman, used as a sexual object by the farmers in the village, unwittingly encourages further self- de gradation by gesturing invitingly to all men, as she does with the protagonist. The octopus, the prophetic god of war, also is unable to discriminate between its victims and its own tentacles. Here Kosiński is again underscoring that sadomasochism is symbolic of the violation of the self in contemporary society. A final montage involving the use of the octopus as "master symbol" occurs in the protagonist's fantasy of destroying the city which he feels has crushed his humanity. Perceiving the city as emblematic of modern industrialized society's violation of humanity, the protagonist imagines himself waging a suicidal holy war of apocalyptic proportions against it: "Thus the world would begin and die with me. I would see the city as a mutant among the wonders of the world, its chimneys polluting the air, its roots poisoning the earth, its tentacles setting one man against another and strangling them both in their hopeless contest. ... I would wage war against this city as if it were a living body" (pp. 133-34). In this image, Kosiński uses evocative and "visceral" language to endow the city with animistic qualities, thus once again underscoring a significant distinction between him and Robbe-Grillet. The octopus god of war thus reappears in the form of one of the most nightmarish products of modern, technological society-the urban megalopolis whose tentacles strangle everything in its path. Because it is ultimately concerned with the possibilities of individual self-identity in a society on the verge of destroying those possibilities, Kosinski's Steps is more philosophically akin to the probing films of Bergman and Fellini and the novels of Camus than to the self-conscious exercises in form typical of many New Novels and New Wave films. While its structure, treatment of time, and visual language may be described as cinematic in the Robbe-Grillet sense, Steps ' exploration of the human condition distinguishes it from the phenomenological stress of the New Novelists. In striving to connect man's inner life with their two-dimensional method of depicting objects, New Wave artists like 21</page><page sequence="7">Robbe- Grillet and Jean- Luc Godard too often render characters into little more than manikins. In Steps , as in his other fiction, however, Kosinski's exploration of the self in modern society depends upon the full development of the protagonist's consciousness through richly evocative language and images. Because he does not attach to form the overriding importance afforded it by the New Novelists, Kosiński is free to concentrate upon projecting his vision of modern man in the twilight zone of industrialized society. Fellini once said that La Dolce Vita was neither "a condemnation, balance sheet or defense of such and such a cause. It takes the temperature of an ailing society, a society that has every appearance of running a fever."7 Bergman's most recent films, meanwhile, have demonstrated that close-ups and extreme close-ups of actors' faces are no less "cinematic" than films where the camera seems to be constantly moving, as in the numerous tracking shots up and down the hotel corridors in Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad. In Steps Kosiński explores the thoughts of his protagonist at close range, as he moves from one episode to the next in his futile quest for self. By forming the narrative fragments of Steps into a pattern approximating the fluidity of the filmic montage, Kosiński combines the sensitivity of a Bergman to nuances of human emotion with the ability of a Fellini to relate the seemingly disconnected experiences of a single protagonist (as in La Dolce Vita) to a presentation of the ills of a decadent society. Kosinski's ability to create striking visual description without sacrificing the power of his language, moreover, further distinguishes Steps as a uniquely cinematic novel.
