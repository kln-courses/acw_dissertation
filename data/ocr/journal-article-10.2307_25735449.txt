<plain_text><page sequence="1">Special Animals from a Special Place? The Fauna from HK29A at Predynastic Hierakonpolis Veerle Linseele, Wim Van Neer,1 and Renee Friedman Abstract Locality HK29A at Predynastic Hierakonpolis has been identified as a ceremonial center based on archaeological, architectural and macrobotanical data, although alternative func tions as a feasting or butchery site have also been proposed. Animal bone assemblages ex cavated at the locality in the 1980s and in 2002 have been studied and are compared in detail to those from other localities at Hierakonpolis, as well as from other Predynastic sites in Upper and Lower Egypt. The comparisons show that HK29A shares several features with other Upper Egyptian sites, which can be related to their similar ecological settings. The fauna from Hierakonpolis settlement localities in general, including HK29A, show some peculiarities that distinguish them from other Predynastic sites in Upper Egypt, which may be explained by the status of the site as a large and powerful center. More importantly, the comparisons clearly show that the fauna from HK29A has some unique features not shared with any other locality at Hierakonpolis. They are argued to reflect a variety of sym bolic roles that animals had, which probably changed throughout the period of use of the locality. Moreover, the faunal remains testify of the high social status of the people taking part in the clearly special activities at HK29A. Introduction The famous site of Hierakonpolis is located between the modern towns of Esna and Edfu in Upper Egypt (fig. 1). Occupied from at least 4000 BC onward, it is the largest Predynastic site still extant and accessible anywhere in Egypt. Exploration of the low desert portion of the site has revealed diverse remains (fig. 2),2 which include cemeteries (e.g., HK6, HK43, HK27), domestic areas (e.g., HK29, HK11C Test A, HK11 Operation G), industrial zones (e.g., HK11C Operations A-B, HK24A) and what has been described as a ceremonial center (HK29A).3 Excavations at Locality HK29A, un dertaken by Michael Hoffman in 1985-1989 and by Renee Friedman in 2002 and 2008 revealed a 1 The contribution of Wim Van Neer to this paper presents research results of the Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme?Belgian Science Policy. 2 Michael A.

As sociated archaeological material dates the main phases of ac tivity to Naqada IIB-IIC (c. 3600-3400 bc), Naqada IID-IIIA (c. 3350-3200 bc) and early Dynasty 0-1 (c. 3150-3000 bc).4 The aim of this contribution is to compare the faunal data from HK29A with that from other localities at Hierakonpolis and the faunal record of Predynastic sites elsewhere in Egypt (table 1) in order to determine whether the animal remains from HK29A can confirm its special function as suggested by the archaeological, architectural and macrobotanical data,5 and contrary to its identification as only a feasting area or per haps merely a butchery site as recently proposed by Kemp.6 Material and Methods The faunal remains from the excavations at HK29A under taken in 1985-89 were analyzed byj. McArdle,7 but never pub lished in detail. The assemblage has recently been restudied along with the fauna obtained from renewed excavation at the site in 2002 and 2008. Preliminary impressions and inferences from these new studies were formulated earlier8 and the data are now presented in a more comprehensive fashion. The site was excavated in a series of subjective find units or loci within a 10x10 m grid system. The material has been merged here for discussion into groupings of related context and date, which are named after associated location or archi tectural features (fig. 3). Most significant in this discussion are the deposits associated with the so-called wall trench and the modified silts on the northeast side of the oval floor, which were extremely rich in faunal remains. Nearly 40,000 bones were recovered in total, with over 25,000 coming from square 150L40SW, a 5x5 m area with less than 45 cm of deposition, which was excavated in 2002 (table 2). Mixed with an equally large number of sherds of distinctive pottery, these deposits appear to be the result of refuse disposal. In the mixed sand that accumulated above the courtyard floor about 4,000 animal bones were collected, while the discrete deposit of or ganic rich sediment directly upon the floor itself ('the floor deposit') yielded slightly more than 2,000 remains. The low density of both faunal and ceramic material in this floor deposit contrasts sharply 4 Dates based on Stan Hendrickx, "Predynastic?Early Dynastic Chronology," in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, and David A.

Scattered animal remains were also collected on the south side of the excavated area from two large, but very disturbed pits (Features 5 and 6), which also con tained the distinctive pottery of the wall trench/modified silts deposits and may originally have been ancient disposal pits. Exploration to the south of the floor in 2008 revealed heavily mixed deposits containing highly weathered faunal material, some of which may have originated from these pits. An other sebakh pit on the northwest side (160L80), from which a concentration of Early Dynastic pot tery was recovered, also contained animal bones, but only 166 specimens, and is too disturbed to be of value. To insure reliable recovery, excavated sediments were dry sieved during the 1980s cam paigns through 6 mm mesh and during the renewed excavations through 4 mm mesh screens. It is mainly fauna from the wall trench and modified silts on the northeast side of the complex and the material on the courtyard floor itself ('the floor deposit') that is discussed in detail below. The deposits in the wall trench and contiguous modified silts can be dated by associated pottery to the Naqada IIB-C period, although the material collected in 2002 in square 150L40SW appears to be somewhat earlier in time (Naqada IIAB).9 The deposits from the floor have been dated to Naqada IIIA. Because of the mixed and unclear nature of the sand deposits above the courtyard floor, mate rial collected there will not be discussed. Nevertheless, its faunal composition shows many similarities 9 See Friedman, this volume.</page><page sequence="4">108 JARCE 45 (2009) HK29A Excavated Area Wall trench n=14792 Mixed Sands, above floor .. n=4105 - .

The material recovered from the south side of the com plex in 2008 is unfortunately too disturbed to be useful for discussion at the present time, and only a few of the special features of that characterize the faunal assemblage at HK29A were observed in this location.10 The relatively poor preservation of the faunal material collected in the courtyard itself and the area to the south is probably a consequence of exposure to the elements and trampling by humans and animals. In general, however, the faunal remains from HK29A are rather well preserved, albeit they do not show the remarkable preservation seen at some of the other localities at Hierakonpolis, such as the wadi site of HK11C Operation G (see below), where hair, hoofs and tendons were recov ered. Very little of the HK29A fauna can be considered to have been found in its primary place of deposition. The vast majority of the material was apparently gathered up in antiquity and re-depos 10 Excavation along the southern side in 2008 produced approximately 11,500 bones of which 10% were identifiable, as is generally the case throughout the locality. The special features present in this assemblage included a significant number of large Nile perch, crocodile and softshell turtle, with the majority coming from the east side of the 318 m2 excavation area, in the vicinity of the sebakh pits Features 5-6 from which they probably originated.</page><page sequence="5">LINSEELE, VAN NEER, AND FRIEDMAN 109 ited in refuse pits along the periphery of the court at an unknown time after its primary deposition in a location and under conditions still unknown. In addition, wetter soil condition and greater insect activity may have had a negative impact on preservation. Recent coring suggests that in Predynastic times a Nile channel was present to the west of the Dynastic town site ('Nekhen') in the alluvium11 and flood waters may on occasion have come close to the site at HK29A. Comparative Samples To place the faunal assemblages from HK29A in a greater context, they are compared first with those from other localities at Hierakonpolis and then with other sites throughout Upper and Lower Egypt from which useful data are available. The first comparative locality is HK29,12 which is a part of the same large, multi-functional settlement nucleus as HK29A (fig. 2). At HK29, Hoffman exca vated a pottery workshop with associated kiln and semi-subterranean, wattle and daub house that was preserved thanks to an accidental fire. It is dated to the Naqada IIAB period. An area of approxi mately 600 m2 was excavated here and produced nearly 10,000 animal bones in total.13 HK11 is another large cluster of settlement remains situated on the southeast side of the Wadi Abu Suffian, approximately 2 km west of HK29A. Relatively undisturbed by sebakh activities, the level of organic preservation is quite high. Several areas within this locality have been investigated. In Oper ation G (Squares G, I, J), part of a farmyard associated with a domestic structure was explored, reveal ing three distinct phases of activity ranging from Naqada IC to Naqada IIC.14 The limited exposure of 167.5 m2 produced a total of 4,442 animal bones. Further up the wadi, excavations at HK11C Operations A (Squares A6-7) and B (Squares B4-5) revealed an integrated industrial zone involving a brewery and pottery manufacturing area respec tively.15 After these establishments were abandoned, the sites were apparently used for domestic refuse disposal and the faunal material from these later deposits compares well with that retrieved from HK11C Test A, a stratified midden nearly 2.5 m deep, located 40 m to the south.16 Together, the localities mentioned above represent a cross-section of what may be considered animal usage in a domestic context. The cemeteries of Hierakonpolis have also yielded faunal remains, those from the elite cemetery at HK6 being the most interesting on several levels. To date, more than one hundred animals, buried whole, have been discovered, albeit the graves are often severely disturbed and the skeletons not al ways complete. Species encountered include traditional domestic animals, such as dog, cattle, sheep, and goat, as well as wild species, such as anubis baboon, elephant, hippopotamus, wild donkey, 11 Judith Bunbury and Angus Graham, "There's Nothing Boring about a Borehole," Nekhen News 20 (2008), 22-23. 12 Michael A.

They were restudied in order to ensure that identification and quantification methods were consistent for the whole of Hierakonpolis and allow for intra-site comparisons. 14 Friedman et al., "Excavations at Hierakonpolis," 55-68. 15 Izumi Takamiya, "Firing Installations and Specialization: A View from Recent Excavations at Hierakonpolis Locality 11C," in Beatrix Midant-Reynes and Yann Tristant, eds., Egypt at its Origins 2.

At that time, the 2x3 m exposure at Operation A produced in total approximately 1,000 animal bones, while similar exposure at Operation B (Square B4NW) yielded a total of about 1,200 bones, with the stratigraphic test trench in Square B4NE providing about 800 pieces. 16 J.

The faunal remains from HK29A are also compared with assemblages from other Neolithic-Pre dynastic settlement sites in Upper Egypt (el-Mahasna, Maghar Dendera 2, Naqada South Town, and Khattara sites, El Abadiya 2, Armant, and Adaima) and Lower Egypt (Buto, Tell el-Iswid, Merimde, Maadi, and El Omari) (fig. 1, table 1). All of the comparative Predynastic sites are permanent settle ments with the exception of Maghar Dendera 2, where occupation appears to have been seasonal and heavily based on fishing.19 Adaima, the most geographically and chronologically proximal site to Hi erakonpolis, provides a good contrast, as it represents a far smaller, more rural and less complex settlement, considered to be within the influence zone, if not the control, of Hierakonpolis.20 Al though extensively excavated, a faunal assemblage similar to that from HK29A was not found, sug gesting that settlement size and complexity are significant factors in faunal composition. Notably, at the larger and more diverse site of el-Mahasna, recent investigations have revealed a post-built struc ture containing a quantity of bovine and anthropomorphic figurines and surrounded by a special faunal assemblage which can be closely compared with that at HK29A. The excavator has linked this structure and its contents with ceremonial activity.21 The HK29A Fauna: Considerations A detailed overview of the faunal remains identified from the various contexts at HK29A is pro vided in table 2. In the discussion of the significance of the HK29A fauna below only those animals that are of deliberate anthropic origin will be considered. Some of the species encountered at the site can be classified as intrusives because they arrived at the site without (conscious) human intention. This is assumed to be the case for the birds of prey (eagle, falcon, and owl) and most of the small ani mals, including the frog or toad, small lizard and snakes, small perching birds, and small rodents that probably lived and died on the site either around the time of ancient occupation (pene-contempora neous intrusives) or long after (late intrusives).22 17 Wim Van Neer, Veerle Linseele, and Renee Friedman, "Animal Burials and Food Offerings at the Elite Cemetery HK6 of Hierakonpolis," in Stan Hendrickx et al., eds., Egypt at its Origins?Studies in Memory of Barbara Adams, Proceedings of the Interna tional Conference "Origin of the State.

The small snails, Corbicula consobrina, Cleopatra bulimoides, and Bulinus truncatus may be considered as geological intrusives.23 They are all of aquatic origin and were either naturally present in the sedi ment at the locality or were unconsciously transported there inside building materials such as mud brick. The pieces of fossil coral found at the site are probably geological intrusives as well. It is sus pected that they are naturally present in geological formations of marine origin near the site. This fossil coral is distinct from the Red Sea coral, which was recorded in disturbed deposits on the south side of the HK29A complex in 2008. At such an exposed site, without significant overburden, a certain level of natural disturbance due to wind and weathering can be assumed. In addition, human disturbance in ancient times during ren ovations and in modern times from sebakh diggers and even archaeologists24 can be held responsible for a certain level of admixture with remains from elsewhere. The minimal presence of human bone may be explained in this way.25 Nevertheless, the vast majority of the animal bones from HK29A must have been deposited there deliberately by humans. Most of them can be assumed to be the re mains of animals that were consumed and/or used in some way within the complex. The various animal groups encountered at HK29A and the other Predynastic sites are discussed below. Attention is focused on the species composition of the assemblages, skeletal distributions and animal ages and sizes, although such data, especially on slaughtering ages and size, are not always available from the comparative sites. Aquatic Fauna from HK29A Molluscs The low number of identified specimens suggests that the harvesting of aquatic molluscs was not an important activity for food procurement at most of the Predynastic sites considered here (table 3), and its importance seems to have been particularly low at Hierakonpolis, especially at HK29A and the wadi sites at HK11C. Only a few large freshwater bivalves were retrieved from HK29A, amongst them one Mutela dubia and one Nile oyster (table 2). The latter species can typically be found in the deeper waters of the Nile whence it is most easily caught when water levels are low.26 Mutela dubia can be collected there as well, but may also be found in the floodplain. Large freshwater bivalves are well known as Predynastic burial gifts to hold cosmetics or serve as scoops,27 and have been recov ered from the non-elite cemetery at HK43.28 Only rare shattered remnants have been recorded from the HK6 elite cemetery of Hierakonpolis, where a variety of shells from the Red Sea were highly 23 Cf. Achilles Gautier, "Freshwater Mollusks and Mammals from Upper Palaeolithic Sites near Idfu and Isna," in Fred Wendorf and Romuald Schild, eds., Prehistory of the Nile Valley (New York, 1976), 349-65. 24 Henri De Morgan reports that at Hierakonpolis and other early sites he set his men to work with rakes. This method netted him many fine lithic and ground stone artefacts, but wreaked havoc on the archaeology. The description of the material he recovered at Hierakonpolis strongly suggests that he worked in this manner in the area of HK29A (cf. Winifred Needier, Predynastic and Archaic Egypt in the Brooklyn Museum [New York, 1984], 53, 114-21). 25 A human phalanx was recovered from the courtyard floor; a partial fibula and vault fragment from the wall trench/ modified silts.

Fish Because fish bones are smaller on average, the relative importance of fish in archaeozoological assemblages is largely dependent on the sampling techniques employed. For optimal recovery of fish remains, sieving is recommended, ideally through meshes as fine as 2 or 1 mm.30 The recovery of large fish, such as Nile perch and several catfish species, is much less affected when excavated sedi ments are not subjected to fine sieving. At HK29A the effect of the sieving techniques is clearly vis ible. The 2002 assemblage from the wall trench area (Square 150L40SW) was sampled through finer mesh than that used in the 1980s excavations and contains a significantly higher proportion of fish: 41% versus 30% of all identified remains of consumed animals, although other factors may have influ enced the composition of the two assemblages (see below). Even when different sampling techniques may have biased the results to some extent, it is clear that with such high average percentages (36% and 43% in the wall trench/modified silts and floor deposit respectively), the relative importance of fish at HK29A is high compared to the other localities at Hierakonpolis (table 3). In the elite cemetery HK6, fish are completely absent from contexts clearly associated with burials or the pillared halls. At the other Predynastic sites in Upper Egypt, the proportion of fish rarely exceeds 25%. Excep tional is the Badarian-early Naqada I site of Maghar Dendera 2, which had a particularly high compo nent of fish (82%) and for this reason it is considered to be a temporary fishing camp. More significantly, el-Mahasna also yielded a high percentage of fish remains in general (58% of the identi fied fauna),31 and specifically around the ritual structure in Block 3 and the adjacent trash disposal area in Block 2.32 At Lower Egyptian sites the relative importance of fish is quite variable and fish may sometimes be present in high percentages within the assemblages. Nilotic fish can be subdivided into two groups according to their habitat requirements: species adapted to living in shallow water and species requiring deep, well-oxygenated water.33 At HK29A, fish of the barbel family, clariid catfish and tilapia belong to the first group, while Bagrus and Syno dontis catfish and Nile perch are open water species. The other identified species are not typically tied to either shallow or deep water. The importance of open water fish at Predynastic localities is variable (table 4). They predominate at most Upper Egyptian sites, but at Hierakonpolis deep water species are generally more common than at nearby and contemporary Adaima. They are especially numerous at HK29A, where their dominance is more marked in the wall trench and modified silts than on the floor of the courtyard. Moreover, in the wall trench and the modified silts about 88% of the deep water fish are Nile perch, against about 60% in the courtyard where Synodontis and Bagrus catfish are more numerous (tables 2 and 4). Excavations at HK11C Operations A and B (samples selectively sieved only) and HK29 (sieved 29 Xavier Droux and Renee Friedman, "The Columned Hall at HK6 and Other Wonders," Nekhen News 19 (2007), 7-9; Renee Friedman, "Excavating Egypt's Early Kings: Recent Discoveries in the Elite Cemetery at Hierakonpolis," in Midant Reynes and Tristant, Egypt at its Origins 2, 1177, fig. 10. 30 Sebastian Payne, "Partial Recovery and Sample Bias: the Results of Some Sieving Experiments," in Eric S. Higgs, ed., Papers in Economic Prehistory (Cambridge, 1972), 49-64. 31 The calculations here and in the tables include only identified and non-intrusive fauna for all sites including el-Mahasna, and for this reason some figures differ from those published in Anderson, "Power and Competition in the Upper Egyptian Pre dynastic," tables 6.5 and 6.7. 32 Anderson, "Power and Competition in the Upper Egyptian Predynastic," fig. 6.23. 33 Wim Van Neer, "Evolution of Prehistoric Fishing in the Nile Valley," Journal of African Archaeology 2 (2004), 251-69.</page><page sequence="12">116 JARCE 45 (2009) through 6 mm mesh) also produced quantities of deep water fish with very high proportions of Nile perch. Nile perch generally preserves better than many other fish species because its bones are sturdy and therefore have a better chance of survival when preservation circumstances are poor. However, the low amount of remains from clariid catfish, a typical shallow water species, which also has strong bones, indicates that the high proportion of Nile perch cannot exclusively be explained by the chances of survival. The large number of fish taxa recorded at HK29A from fish with rather fragile bones, such as mullet and Alestes, also argues against a significant influence from differential preser vation of the fish samples. In addition to the large numbers in which they are present, it is also striking that the Nile perch of the wall trench/modified silts at HK29A frequently represent individuals that must have had a length of one meter or more (figs. 4-5).34 Moreover, the number of individual Nile perch of large size in this part of HK29A has no doubt been under-estimated because many of the vertebrae are fragmentary and therefore size estimates were difficult to make. It is not clear if large Nile perch also predomi nated on the courtyard floor, since only six Nile perch remains allowed size estimates, of which one gave a result of over one meter. Nile perch is ubiquitous at Epipalaeolithic and later archaeological sites in the Egyptian Nile Valley and indicates that fishing took place in the main river channels.35 The species is easiest to catch when water levels are low. Larger specimens are found in deeper parts of the River Nile. The large-sized Nile perch, which are abundant in the samples from HK29A and elsewhere around the site, suggest that access to larger specimens was relatively easy at Hierakonpolis. This view is supported by recent geomorphological investigations indicating that the Nile in this region had a much deeper channel in the past.36 At present, young specimens, measuring up to about 60 cm in length, are considered to yield the best quality flesh;37 however, the capture of larger Nile perch requires more efforts and these large fish may have been considered more prestigious, their size rather than their flesh being the decisive factor. The deposits in and around the structure at el-Mahasna (Block 3) yielded fish of larger size than any other parts of the site.38 In this case not only Nile in this Region perch, but also clariid cat fish and tilapia were larger than usual. Within the samples from HK29A, elements from the body (mainly vertebrae) of Nile perch appear to be over-represented when compared to other Predynastic sites (table 5). It is possible that this skeletal distribution is a result of processing at another location, where elements from the head, pectoral girdle and fins, to which less flesh adhere, were removed. However, the significance of this distribution may be more apparent than real due in part to the large numbers of fragmentary verte brae, each one able to fall into many still recognizable (and quantifiable) parts. Whatever the case, there is a notable difference in the percentage of body parts present in the assemblage collected in 2002 in 150L40SW (82% were vertebrae) and that collected during the 1980s excavations (65%). The taphonomic circumstances between the two areas were not notably different and the distinction may relate to differences in the activities of which this refuse is the remnant. 34 Taphonomic processes may partly explain the high amounts of large Nile perch, as their large bones have better odds for survival and retrieval than small remains. Smaller specimens can also be under-represented when no sieving is carried out during excavation, or when it involves the use of only large mesh sizes. However, since there are no reasons to assume that sieving was less adequate at the localities where large Nile perch abound, the observed size distributions may be relevant. 35 Van Neer, "Evolution of Prehistoric Fishing in the Nile Valley." 36 Judith Bunbury and Angus Graham, pers. comm. 37 William Reed, John Buchard, A.

Distribution of estimated standard length (SL) of Nile perch at several Predynastic sites in Upper and Lower Egypt. Aquatic reptiles Whereas the fish fauna from HK29A display some exceptional characteristics, the aquatic reptiles are even more distinctive. No other Predynastic settlement site has yielded as many remains of croc odile and only at el-Mahasna (although not concentrated in Block 3) were comparable quantities of softshell turtle found (table 3). Present in almost all contexts at HK29A, there are some differences in distribution. While the courtyard floor and wall trench/modified silts both produced quantities of crocodile (3% of all iden tified remains of consumed animals in both contexts), large numbers of softshell turtle were re corded only in the wall trench/modified silts (6% compared to 1% on the floor). Crocodile is represented by limb bones, vertebrae, and especially dermal scutes. Of softshell turtle only carapax fragments have been found, and judging from their thickness (up to 9 mm), they are from rather large individuals. Softshell turtles can grow up to 70 cm long. They are generally very aggressive and can bite ferociously.39 The animals can therefore be rather dangerous. Nevertheless, meat of softshell turtles featured on the menu of the ancient Egyptians.40 Larger animals may have been speared as shown in pharaonic art, while small specimens were possibly captured in nets together with fish.41 Contemporary depictions of the crocodile hunt on White Cross line pottery of the Naqada I-IIA period suggests that nets were generally used to capture the crocodile,42 although a vessel of Decorated 39 Andre Villiers, Tortues et crocodiles de VAfrique Noire Francaise, Initiations africaines 15 (Dakar, 1958), 197-219. 40 Henry G.

Reports of the consumption of crocodile flesh are limited to the classical authors,44 suggesting that their capture in the Predynastic was for reasons other than nourishment.

Since their bones are more fragile than those of other vertebrates, they have more chance of being destroyed by vari ous taphonomic processes. On the level of a single site, their relative economic importance may therefore be underestimated; however, since this factor is constant, it does not hamper inter-site comparisons.

Many of these are seasonal visitors to the area, but most species must have been available during the autumn,45 when Nile floodwaters would have been receding. Hunted Mammals and Terrestrial Reptiles at HK29A At the comparative Predynastic sites, bones of animals obtained by hunting usually do not exceed 5% of the remains of all consumed species (table 3). Higher proportions are found in the early sites in Upper Egypt, for example, at El Abadiya (10%) where they are almost exclusively due to the large number of gazelle bones found there.46 At Maghar Dendera 2, there was also a high frequency of game compared to domestic animals,47 although this is obscured in table 3 by the large amounts of fish. By Naqada II times, however, hunting as a subsistence activity declined. In the settlement sites at Hierakonpolis, the percentage of hunted animals is only 1-3%. In marked contrast stands HK29A, where hunted animals make up an average 8% of the assemblage, and in clude a diverse spectrum of species. At el-Mahasna more game was also found around the ritual struc ture in Block 3 than in other parts of the site, with over 62% of all wild mammals originating from this area.48 Dorcas gazelle Dorcas gazelle is the main wild species at all of the Upper Egyptian Predynastic settlements consid ered here (table 6). Gazelle makes up nearly 70% of all hunted mammals in the wall trench/modified silts at HK29A, although a smaller amount of gazelle (46%) was recovered from the deposits in the northeast excavated in 2002 than in those from further to the west uncovered in the 1980s (77%). In comparison to Adaima, where gazelle is also prominent, making up 68% of all hunted mammals, HK29A has yielded more remains of meat-bearing skeletal elements.

Nearly all of the gazelle bones from HK29A have fused articulations, indicating that mainly adult animals were hunted. A similar emphasis on adult gazelles was observed at Adaima, while at Merimde minimally one-third of the gazelle bones were from juveniles.49 Dorcas gazelle was much less important as a game animal in Lower Egypt, probably as a conse quence of the ecological differences between the two regions. The habitat of dorcas gazelle at present includes stony deserts to coastal plains with vegetation.50 It has been suggested that dorcas gazelles were easier to catch during the part of the year when Nile levels were low, since they were then attracted to areas closer to the river where they could still find water and food.51 Burials of gazelles in various Predynastic Upper Egyptian cemeteries (mainly in the Badari region) are mentioned in the literature;52 however, this attribution may at least in part be an erroneous iden tification of ovicaprines.53 Gazelle was not found amongst the animals buried in the elite cemetery HK6,54 but, just beyond three of the four corners of the pillared Structure 07 at HK6, small clusters of dorcas gazelle bones were found in shallow pits dug into the hard gravely soil, in one case in con junction with the only pig bones found in the entire precinct.55 Hare The second most commonly hunted mammal in Predynastic Upper Egypt is hare, an inhabitant of open country, open grasslands, steppes, and subdesert.56 The animal is not especially frequent in the Predynastic sites of Lower Egypt, but today seems to thrive equally well in all parts of the country.57 As a small animal that was probably exploited when larger alternatives were not available,58 it may have been hunted more frequently in Upper Egypt, as this region had a more limited selection of game. Hare makes up 14% of the wall trench/modified silt hunted mammal assemblage, but only about 5% of that from the floor deposit; nevertheless, only the early camp at Maghar Dendera 2 and Naqada have greater frequencies percentage-wise. Small wild bovids In addition to hare and dorcas gazelle, other desert species like Barbary sheep, ibex, and dama gazelle were occasionally hunted in Upper Egypt during the Predynastic period. Ibex and Barbary sheep prefer similar rocky mountains habitats, but the distribution area of the ibex is believed to be limited to the east side of the Nile.59 49 Angela von den Driesch and Joachim Boessneck, Die Tierknochenfunde aus der neolithischen Siedlung von Merimde-Beni salame am westlichen Nildelta (Miinchen, 1985), 6-14. 50 Richard Hoath, A Field Guide to the Mammals of Egypt (Cairo-New York, 2003), 152. 51 Achilles Gautier and Wim Van Neer, "The Animal Remains from the Late Paleolithic Sequence in Wadi Kubbaniya," in Fred Wendorf, Romuald Schild, and Angela E.

Barbary sheep are also depicted with some frequency in the art of the Predynastic period,61 but their remains are rare at sites outside of Hierakonpolis and Adaima. Only at el-Mahasna, again originating from the area of the ritual structure, have the remains of Barbary sheep been reported in fre quencies comparable to HK29A.62 Dama gazelle is another species that is also rare in Predynastic assemblages and to date is known only from HK29A, HK11 Operation G and Adaima. In the desert, dama gazelle is often found in close association with dorcas gazelle,63 and the two species may therefore have been caught together during the same hunting trips. Of the animals discussed above, none are represented in Lower Egyptian sites with the exception of the ibex, which has been identified at Maadi.64 However, most of the ibex remains at Maadi are horn-cores, which may have been traded and therefore may not be truly indicative of the frequency of this animal in the Maadi area. Hartebeest and aurochs In contrast to the above, hartebeest bones have been found at many of the Predynastic sites in Lower Egypt. The animal was very common at Merimde, especially during Phases I?II. Its remains have also been identified at Maadi and El Omari. In Upper Egypt, a few bones were recorded at Naqada, El Abadiya, and Adaima. At Hierakonpolis, hartebeest occurs in the wall trench/modified silts deposits at HK29A and one complete individual was buried in the elite cemetery HK6 after hav ing spent some time in captivity.65 Together with aurochs and dorcas gazelle, hartebeest was among the most frequently hunted ani mals in the Nile Valley during the Late Palaeolithic.66 Its population declined in later times under the pressure of continued hunting, and probably more significantly because of competition with domes tic cattle.67 Such competition may also explain the notable drop in hartebeest remains at Merimde between Phases I?II and Phases IV-V. The animal is now extinct in Egypt. The fact that hartebeest remains are present only at HK29A and HK6 may indicate that the animal was already difficult to obtain by the early Naqada II period in Upper Egypt. The aurochs presumably also disappeared due to competition with domestic cattle. Both aurochs and hartebeest probably survived longer in Lower than in Upper Egypt, since their preferred habitat is open grassland, which was more extensive in the Delta.68 Aurochs still occurred in Lower Egypt un til at least the Roman period.69 During the Predynastic it was apparently still part of the available 60 Dale J.

Hippopotamus Hippopotamus, an enormous semi-aquatic mammal, is thought to have been commonly hunted during the Predynastic, particularly in Lower Egypt. Although the hippopotamus is an important motif in the art of Predynastic Upper Egypt,71 remains of this animal are comparatively uncommon. In the settlements of Upper Egypt, only Locality HK11 Operation B yielded relatively high amounts of hippo bones, but all may derive from a single individual. In the elite cemetery HK6, three young hippos, one only a few days old, were found buried either individually or with other animals.72 At HK29A hippopotamus bones were present in the wall trench, modified silts, and in the courtyard. Many of these bones are unfused or not yet well ossified, indicating that young animals were present here also. However, judging from their larger size and the recovery of some elements with fused epi physes, for example, a second phalanx, they must have been on average older than the individuals from the HK6 cemetery. Whatever the age, the harpooning of these animals must have been a dan gerous enterprise that was probably carried out as a group activity. This is also suggested by scenes on contemporary pottery and rock art,73 although by Dynasty 1 it is the king alone shown undertaking this heroic task with explicit symbolic overtones.74 Other hunted animals and carnivores The remains of carnivores are much more numerous in the wall trench and modified silts of HK29A than in any other Predynastic settlement context, including the courtyard floor (table 6). They appear to be more common in the deposits recovered during 2002 excavations at the eastern end of the wall trench area (8% of all identified mammals) than in those found earlier to the west (6%). Canid remains, identified as Canis sp., are responsible for this high percentage (table 6). They are most probably domestic dogs, although the presence of jackal cannot be totally excluded since that animal's bones resemble those of dog very closely. Similar skeletal elements are present in all 70 Van Neer, Linseele, and Friedman, "Animal Burials and Food Offerings," 99-101; Sylvia Warman, "Predynastic Egyptian Bovid Burial in the Elite Cemetery at Hierakonpolis," in Sharyn J.

A cut-mark on a talus found in the wall trench area suggests that the pelts may have been removed.75 The burial of dogs is relatively frequently in Predynastic Egypt. Several examples occur in the elite cemetery HK6,76 but also in the cemetery at Adaima77 and elsewhere.78 Fennec, RuppeH's fox, striped hyena, and small cats were identified from the wall trench and mod ified silts at HK29A. Cutmarks on the distal end of the scapula of the fennec suggest that it was also skinned. Fennec has not been recorded at any of the other Predynastic sites except Merimde. Riip pell's fox is equally rare and is elsewhere only present at Adaima and HK11 Operation G. A metatar sal of striped hyena was found in the wall trench of HK29A and the courtyard yielded an axis of this species. One hyena bone was found at Naqada and this carnivore is also attested at Merimde and Maadi in Lower Egypt. Small cats are found regularly at Predynastic settlement sites and swamp cat and wild cat were also found buried at HK6.79 Birds of prey and carnivores, wild as well as domestic, are usually not considered food refuse unless there are clear indications to the contrary, such as butchery marks. The wild carnivores from HK29A? fennec, Ruppell's fox, striped hyena, wild cat, and perhaps also jackal?may have been hunted for their pelts. Domestic dogs probably served the humans during their lives, but the cut marks on a dog talus suggest that they too could be skinned. Since it is assumed that the carnivores from HK29A were not eaten and their carcasses were disposed of after death, more or less complete skeletons would be expected in the deposits, but this is not the case. The state of preservation and degree of fragmentation of the carnivore bones were not noticeably different from those of species considered as consumed animals. Although it cannot be entirely excluded that at HK29A carnivores were also eaten, the observed pattern may instead relate to the removal of debris, including carcasses, from an original location (primary refuse), which was then dumped and dispersed along the wall trench and in the pits dug into the modified silts (secondary refuse). Apart from mammals, two terrestrial reptiles also appear among the species captured during the Predynastic: tortoise and monitor lizard, although neither of them seems to have been of significant economic importance. Tortoise has been identified only in Lower Egypt, while monitor lizard is at tested in both Lower and Upper Egypt. One monitor lizard bone was found in the wall trench area at HK29A and another in its courtyard. The only other Upper Egyptian site where this animal has been identified is Adaima. Final remarks on hunted animals The wild mammal species that occur at HK29A have been found at other Predynastic sites (table 6), but nowhere else is the species richness80 of one location and context so high.

This indicates that hunting was not only more intense (as indicated by the high percentage of wild mammals), but also that it was taking place in a wider array of biomes. The spectrum of wild species found buried at the elite cemetery HK6 is considerably different from all Predynastic settlement sites, but some species are shared with HK29A. Although the cemetery was used from Naqada I into the Naqada III period, the burial of wild animals is a feature of its earlier phases only (Naqada IC-IIB), which are roughly contemporary with the earliest phase at HK29A. The complete, unbutchered carcasses of the animals were interred often in group burials, with and with out grave goods and rarely with human accompaniment.81 Most notable in the cemetery is the pres ence of baboons and elephants. Unattested at any other Predynastic site, they must have been imported from more southerly regions. Together with the aurochs and hartebeest, they suggest a focus on the exotic and rare, and may be considered at minimum as expressions of the power or wealth of their owners.82 Healed injuries observed on the bones of several of the animals buried at HK6 indicate that they were kept in captivity for some time before their death.83 Such pathologies were not observed on the fauna from HK29A or any other Predynastic settlement site. However, it can not be excluded that the animals were held captive prior to their offering/consumption at HK29A, and it has recently be argued that capture rather than killing is what is being expressed in the contemporary scenes of hunting on pottery and in rock art.84 Pathologies formed on the animal skeletons as a consequence of capture or the unnatural conditions in which they were kept would be less easily observable on fragmentary refuse than on complete individuals, and may therefore not have been recorded. Domestic Livestock at HK29A The figures for the identified remains of animals classified as food refuse in table 3 make it clear that animal proteins were obtained at the Predynastic sites considered in this study by practicing a variable mixture of gathering, hunting, fowling, fishing and stock keeping, the latter two activities being economically the most important. Taking into account their greater meat weight in comparison to fish, domestic livestock was usually the main source of animal protein. Only at Maghar Dendera 2 was livestock of lesser importance. The site has been considered as a temporary fishing camp used by a small group of people who probably brought with them only a few livestock animals to herd while they were away from their permanent base and homestead.85 81 Amongst the limited faunal remains in the non-elite cemetery HK43 at Hierakonpolis (Naqada IIA-C) wild animals were not found (Van Neer and Linseele, unpublished data). 82 Van Neer, Linseele, and Friedman, "Animal Burials and Food Offerings"; Renee Friedman, "Elephants at Hierakonpolis," in Hendrickx et al., Egypt at its Origins, 131-68. 83 Healed injuries were observed on the swamp cat (Linseele, Van Neer, and Hendrickx, "Evidence for Early Cat Taming in Egypt"; Linseele, Van Neer, and Hendrickx, "Early Cat Taming in Egypt"), several of the baboons (Wim Van Neer and Veerle Linseele, "New analyses of old bones?The faunal remains from Hierakonpolis," Nekhen News 14 [2002], 7-8; Van Neer, Linseele, and Friedman, "Animal Burials and Food Offerings"; Van Neer, Linseele, and Friedman, "More Animal Burials"), a hippopotamus and the hartebeest (Van Neer and Linseele, "Animal Hospital"). 84 Gwenola Graff, Merel Eyckerman, and Stan Hendrickx, "Architectural Elements on Decorated Pottery and Ritual Present ing of Desert Animals," in Renee Friedman, Liam McNamara, and Peter Fiske, eds., Egypt at its Origins 3.

Hierakonpolis is the sole Predynastic settlement where cattle bones predominate. It is only in the courtyard area at HK29A and in the midden at HK11C Test A that ovicaprines dominate the domestic species composition. Possible reasons for the high propor tions of cattle at Hierakonpolis may include locally better ecological circumstances, such as greater grazing capacity in the Wadi Abu Suffian,86 as well as or in addition to a higher social status for its inhabitants, since cattle have always been the domesticate to which the most status or economic wealth has been associated.87 Cattle bones are poorly represented on the courtyard floor at HK29A possibly because this area was periodically cleaned. It may be assumed that the chances of bones being removed during clean ing activities increase with their dimensions and cattle bones are generally large. Although the total amount of cattle bones recovered from the courtyard is low and the skeletal distribution may there fore not be reliable, the (small) foot bones of cattle are more common in the courtyard area than in the wall trench and modified silts. This may indicate the selective removal of large bones and the fact that small bones were overlooked during cleaning. It could also suggest changes in ritual practice, since footbones as representative of the full animal are found in the funerary deposits, for example at Dayr al-Barsha, although the larger metapodals are also present at that site.88 Analysis of the fusion data on the long bones of cattle from the Hierakonpolis localities and Adaima indicates that the animals from the wall trench and modified silts of HK29A were on aver age killed at a younger age, although individuals of all age classes are present (table 8). For the courtyard deposits the evidence for age was insufficient. Analyses of the osteometric data indicates larger cattle on average at HK29A than at the other settlement sites at Hierakonpolis or Adaima (fig. 6). In the elite cemetery HK6, the cattle also had a large average size. Cattle at the elite ceme tery were buried whole but also occurred as butchered food offerings, sometimes in the form of a right foreleg.89 Similar offerings are known from Adaima,90 as well as from later Dynastic sites91 and Dynastic iconography.92 It is unclear if the larger average size of cattle at HK29A is due to the slaughtering of a generally larger type ('breed') of animals, or if it is a consequence of sex distribution in the assemblage. Males are usually larger than females, and average size therefore rises when proportionally more males are killed. At the elite cemetery at HK6 male and female individuals have been identified in equal pro portions, pointing to generally large animals, but the data from HK29A are insufficient to establish the sex ratio and the precise reason for the larger average size of its cattle. At el-Mahasna the ritual structure showed a higher proportion of cattle, and particularly of young cattle, than the other parts of the site.93 The same area also contained a larger proportion of elements from the forelimbs of cattle. No details were provided on the size of these cattle. 86 Harlan, "Excavations at Locality 11C." 87 Stan Hendrickx, "Bovines in Egyptian Predynastic and Early Dynastic Iconography," in Fekri A.

They are also very common at the other Predynastic settlements, and have been found in cemeteries, both as buried animals and as food offerings.94 In Upper Egypt goat usu ally predominates over sheep, while in Lower Egypt, the opposite is true, with the most pronounced case being at Merimde (table 7). This distinction may be due to the poorer ecological conditions in Upper Egypt, since goats are better suited than sheep for survival in areas with low quality pasture.95 In Upper Egypt, only in the midden at HK11C (Test A) and in el-Mahasna have more sheep than goat bones been recorded. The greater grazing capacity afforded by the terraces of the Wadi Abu Suffian may have allowed sheep to flourish here. The factors influencing the sheep/goat ratio at el-Mahasna are unknown. As was the case for cattle, the skeletal distribution of ovicaprines shows an over-representation of small foot elements on the courtyard floor as compared to the wall trench/modified silts at HK29A. The fusion data for the ovicaprines from HK29A also points to a younger average age at death than at other localities at Hierakonpolis and Adaima (table 9). Osteometrical data on ovicaprines bones have not yet revealed any significant size differences between Predynastic sites. pig During the Predynastic period, fewer pigs appear to have been kept in Upper Egypt than in Lower Egypt, no doubt as a consequence of less suitable ecological conditions.96 The proportion of pig in the settlements of Hierakonpolis generally appears to be lower than at Adaima (9% and 19% respectively), but the lowest frequency of pig can be observed at HK29A, and especially on its courtyard floor (2%). The infrequency of pig at Hierakonpolis may also be connected to its role as a central place, since it has been suggested that pigs in the Near East were less common where control by a central authority over the economy was high.97 It is possible that the number of pigs eaten dropped as the social status of the consumer rose. These animals are therefore more typical of rural settlements. Pig is absent at Maghar Dendera 2 as this animal is not suited for long distance movement and the people seasonally occupying the site probably did not take pigs with them. At Merimde, it has been suggested that pigs had religious significance because several skeletons of neonate animals were found;98 however, the death of these young animals may simply have been due to natural causes such as drought or disease. Similar evidence has not been observed at any other Predynastic site, although a juvenile pig was found associated with a human burial at Wadi Digla,99 and a young pig was buried within the settlement area at Adaima.100 Pigs were not identified in the buried fauna of the elite cemetery HK6,101 but several bones were recovered from shallow deposits outside the 94 Van Neer, Linseele, and Friedman, "Animal Burials and Food Offerings," table 1; Flores, Funerary Sacrifice of Animals in the Egyptian Predynastic Period; Diane V.

The fusion data obtained from the pig bones at Hierakonpolis and Adaima indicate that the animals were generally slaughtered at a rather young age (table 10). At HK29A, only 5 out of 24 remains are of individuals older than 2 years of age. Although the data is limited, the emphasis on young animals may have been greater than elsewhere. Very few measurements could be taken on the bones from HK29A, but they fit within the known variation for Upper Egypt, where pigs seem to have been on aver age smaller than those in Lower Egypt. This may be related to less favorable ecological conditions for pig breeding.102 Donkey Donkey is rare at HK29A, attested by only four re mains in the wall trench/modified silts deposits. It is not clear whether these remains derive from the wild or domestic form, and the same is true for a few iso lated donkey bones retrieved from HK11C Opera tion B, and HK29. Remains of both wild and domestic donkeys have been found at the elite ceme tery HK6, but in disturbed contexts.103 The tapho nomic status of the donkey remains from HK29A is not clear. Although their state of preservation is not dissimilar from that of the rest of the fauna, it cannot be entirely excluded that they are recent intrusives. Discussion Peculiarities of the HK29A fauna The faunal assemblages collected from HK29A are unique in many respects, but they also share in a number of overall economic trends visible during the Predynastic period. At HK29A, as at other Predy nastic settlement sites in both Upper and Lower Egypt, harvested shells and captured birds are of limited importance. The HK29A assemblages also correspond to the pattern generally seen in the Predynastic for livestock-keeping as the main eco 102 Cf.

The faunal material from HK29A also exhibits several characteristics that are typical only of Upper Egyptian Predynastic sites, such as the prevalence of goat over sheep and the relatively infrequency of pigs, which are usually smaller in size. The differences between archaeozoological assemblages from Predynastic Upper and Lower Egypt are probably due in large part to diverse ecological condi tions prevailing in the two parts of the country. All Upper Egyptian settlement sites have a similar spectrum of hunted species, amongst which gazelle is the most prevalent, but some rare, additional animals are present at HK29A. Although sharing in the overall trends visible in Upper Egypt, the assemblages from the Hierakon polis localities differ in a number of significant ways. Hierakonpolis, in general, differs from other Upper Egyptian Predynastic sites in that cattle are the most frequently consumed domestic animal species in most of its settlement localities. This is also the case in the wall trench/modified silts of HK29A. As discussed above, cattle may be under-represented in the courtyard area because of cleaning activities. Pig is rarer at Hierakonpolis, including HK29A, than at most other Upper Egyptian sites. Both the higher rate of cattle consumption and the low frequency of pig at Hierakonpolis may be</page><page sequence="28">132 JARCE 45 (2009) Table 9. Fusion data for ovicaprines (cf.

Within Hierakonpolis itself, HK29A stands out as one of the few localities that has yielded a large quantity of fish, particularly open water species and especially Nile perch. The Nile perch from HK29A are also of large size with many specimens exhibiting an estimated standard length of one meter or more. Another unique feature is the younger average age at which livestock was slaugh tered. In addition, the larger average size of the cattle from HK29A is remarkable when compared to the other settlement sites of Hierakonpolis and Adaima. Hunted animals are also exceptionally frequent at HK29A and their diverse species spec trum includes fennec, hyena, and hartebeest, animals that are not found at any other settlement lo cality at Hierakonpolis. Further striking characteristics of the HK29A fauna are the particularly high number of remains from crocodile and softshell turtle. The habitat requirements of the different spe cies illustrate that hunting was practiced in a wide variety of biomes. The unusual features of the faunal assemblage, specifically the large quantities of sizable fish, wild game, and young cattle as well as the presence of crocodile and turtle, have also been observed at</page><page sequence="29">LINSEELE, VAN NEER, AND FRIEDMAN 133 el-Mahasna around a structure containing a number of figurines, many portraying slaughtered cattle.104 This pattern of animal usage is clearly more than coincidental and indicates that activities were taking place in these localities that were significantly different from those undertaken elsewhere at the same sites. Symbolic meaning In Dynastic times, many of the species found at HK29A and el-Mahasna, such as the crocodile, turtle and wild mammals, were considered symbols of typhonic forces or agents of chaos.105 The role that crocodile, turtle, hippopotamus and gazelle play in the rather restricted artistic iconography of the Naqada I-IIC period, often in association with the hunt, gives some indication of the importance that these animals had at the time the structure at HK29A was in use. This hunt, whether undertaken by human agents, dogs or left unstated,106 is considered to represent the containment of chaos and the capture or killing of wild animals in general has long been understood as an allegory on untamed chaos brought under control. The recent publication of a seal impression from Abydos showing King Den harpooning not a hippo, but beheaded human enemies, makes this connection explicit at least by Dynasty l.107 The similarity of the fauna and the architectural remains at HK29A to the scene carved on the Narmer macehead has been commented on before.108 Wherever one wishes to locate the action de picted on the macehead or however one wants to explain it,109 the presence of animals, both wild and domestic, in a ritual context makes their use as symbols of power and control clear. The fact that ani mals, including an unusually high percentage of wild and especially presumably inedible carnivore species, occur at HK29A suggests that they were brought to the site and sacrificed as embodiments of chaotic forces and not simply for consumption during (ritual or secular) feasting. The material from HK29A would thus appear to be the physical remains of the actual execution of a ritual with a long history in Egypt, the containment of unrule being one of the chief roles of the king as depicted on and within temple structures throughout the Dynastic period.110 In addition to the symbolic meanings of the fauna from HK29A, it can also be argued that many of its special characteristics are due to the high social status of the people taking part in the activities therein,111 their status and wealth being reflected in the selection of particular animal species (Nile perch and cattle) and of animals with special qualities (large Nile perch, young and large livestock). The high proportion of game also implies a connection with the elite segment of society. The associ ation between hunting and the Predynastic elite has been described by Hendrickx112 and the breed ing and training of domestic dogs for the hunt have strong elite connotations.113 In this respect, the presence of dogs (and other carnivores) in the deposits can be read as elite largesse in sacrificing us able assets or showing power over the powerful.

Another type of symbolism that can be seen in the fauna from HK29A is the contrast between the riverine (fish, aquatic reptiles, and hippos) and desert (wild game) environments, a dichotomy also stressed in the art of the period. Several of the animal species found at HK29A, including large Nile perch, Nile oyster, and gazelles, were easiest to obtain during the parts of the year when the Nile wa ters were low and the spatial distance between the two environments was least pronounced. The festivities taking place at the temple may therefore have been related to the anticipated arrival of the Nile flood, which occurred at the end of June in ancient times. However, over its long use-life the complex was no doubt the locus of a variety of ritual activities that may also find reflection in the faunal assemblages. The fauna from the wall trench/modified silts and the courtyard at HK29A are generally similar, yet within these assemblages temporal and compositional differences have been observed. The mate rial collected in 2002 from the relatively undisturbed refuse pits in square 150L40SW appear some what earlier in time (Naqada IIAB), based on associated pottery, than the material recovered in the 1980s (Naqada IIBC). The faunal collection contained slightly more fish (possibly due to finer sam pling techniques), but much less gazelle (46% of all wild fauna) compared to the 1980s material (77%), and more carnivores (8% versus 6%). Such variation may simply be seen as the luck of the hunt at any given time, or differing perceived requirements for the ritual activity undertaken; nevertheless, the overall similarity in the faunal constituents indicates certain basic needs. On the other hand, the deposit from the courtyard floor, dated to the early Naqada III period, may provide evidence for changing requirements or conceptions over time. The more limited courtyard assemblage yielded proportionally less deep water fish, less Nile perch and less cattle. These differ ences can be attributed to the periodic cleaning of the floor when the largest and most visible bones were removed, but the predominance of foot bones from cattle and ovicaprines may also suggest that only 'representative' parts of the animal were offered, while the more meat bearing portions were retained for other purposes or consumed at another place. The floor deposit also had a lower pro portion of turtle, pig and carnivore bones compared to the wall trench/modified silts and this cannot be explained by cleaning. Especially for the carnivores the difference is striking. As the majority of this category is composed of what is most probably domestic dog, the limited numbers on the court yard floor may be related to the diminishing status of this animal at this time.118 It may also reflect waning interest in depictions of the hunt to express control in light of the growing codification of 114 Thomas J. Logan, "The Origins of the Jmy-wt Fetish," JARCE 27 (1990), 61-69; Baines, "Symbolic Roles of Canine Figures." 115 Stan Hendrickx, "Peaux d'animaux comme symboles predynastiques. A propos de quelques representations sur les vases White Cross-lined," CdE 73 (1998), 203-30; idem, "The Dog, the Lycaon pictus and Order over Chaos in Predynastic Egypt." 116 Fish being an obvious exception, although clariid catfish can survive for a relatively long time outside water. 117 Van Neer, Linseele, and Friedman, "Animal Burials and Food Offerings." 118 Hendrickx, "The Dog, the Lycaon pictus and Order over Chaos in Predynastic Egypt"; Hendrickx et al. "A Lost Late Pre dynastic-Early Dynastic Royal Scene."</page><page sequence="31">LINSEELE, VAN NEER, AND FRIEDMAN 135 royal iconography119 and the sole role the king ultimately takes in this regard as witnessed in the documents of King Den.120 Decreased interest in wild animals as well as dwindling supplies thereof may also be observed in the elite cemetery at HK6, where the burials of wild animals are no longer a feature of the Naqada III period of cemetery activity.121 While animals are frequent in the Naqada IC-IIB burials at HK6, apparently as expressions of the wealth and power of their deceased owners, their remains are much less prevalent in the contem porary pillared halls, or 'funerary temples' in that cemetery. The specialized pottery forms found only in the pillared halls and at HK29A indicate that ritual activity was undertaken at both locations, but manifest in different ways. Interest in expressing control over chaos is present in the funerary tem ples, but is mainly restricted to the artistic record, with wild animals shaped in flint and deposited together with a number of arrowheads.122 The only examples of actual gazelle and pig remains in the cemetery occur in shallow pits outside the corners of the pillared hall Structure 07, which perhaps not coincidentally are oriented to the cardinal points. Fragmentary and outside, it seems likely that these remains reflect these animals as enemies to be destroyed and cast out, and then used in apotropaic fashion to protect the structure.123 In contrast to the HK29A complex, the consumption of animals by the living does not appear to have taken place in the funerary temples HK6 or its debris was thoroughly removed. Although there seems to be a slight over-representation of meat bearing elements in fish and domestic and wild mammals in the HK29A assemblages, it is not clear whether this is sufficient to draw any conclusions on the place where processing took place (i.e., on-site or off-site). However, as over 80% of the lithic assemblage from HK29A is composed of the debitage from the manufacture of finely flaked bifacial tools, which based on the few examples recovered from the site are probably knives,124 it may plausibly be suggested that "ritual butchery" as well as consumption took place in the vicinity, if not within the excavated structure. In contrast to the funerary assemblage, at H29A, the importance of fish and aquatic reptiles is con siderable. The later prohibition against the consumption of fish by priests and officials has been found reflected in archaeozoological faunal samples at Middle Kingdom Abydos;125 however, the use of fish in temple feasts in the New Kingdom is well documented.126 Whether symbolic of the chaos (or bounty) of nature,127 or simply food for feasting, the large size of the fish at HK29A must have made them impressive trophies. Their large number and apparent importance at both HK29A and el-Mahasna suggests that the early cylinder seals depicting what are generally agreed to be temple struc tures and fish might be best interpreted in a literal way rather than as evidence of early writing.128 119 Cf.

While certain themes are pervasive, the testimony of one time and place need not necessarily be valid for another. The faunal assemblages from HK29A have been compared with contemporary assem blages throughout Predynastic Egypt and within the site of Hierakonpolis itself. The unique compo sition of the HK29A faunal material leaves no doubt that something special was happening here, whether annually or only occasionally is unknown. The large, dangerous, and rare animals acquired, apparently at great effort, makes explanations of the place as simply a butchery site or feasting area129 untenable. Although feasting was no doubt an important part of the activities at the site, the full range of the animals found at HK29A, especially in light of contemporary artistic iconography, strongly indicate a ritual or ceremonial purpose. These are special animals in a special place.
