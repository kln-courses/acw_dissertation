<plain_text><page sequence="1">"I Named Them As / They Passed": / Kinds of Animals / and Humankind /by John hollander / i't a significant moment in what we are told is the one book Darwin carried always with him aboard, and on treks ashore from, The Beagle,1 Adam recounts to the angel Raphael what he remembers of his life. In Book VIII of Paradise Lost (345-8) he recalls how God commanded him, as Lord and possessor of whatever lived in every element, to behold each bird and beast "after their kinds": God also explained that the fish were also to be understood and named, but that they could not be present for this event, being unable to "change / Their element to draw the thinner air." (The text of Genesis 2.20, "And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field," omits the aquatic creatures, and Milton hastens to provide a midrashic gloss.) Adam continues: As thus he spake each bird and beast behold Approaching two and two, these cowering low With blandishment, each bird stooped on his wing. I named them as they passed, and understood Their nature, with such knowledge God endued My sudden apprehension . . . (349ff). Naming, and thereby "understanding their nature," was at once the first poetry and the first zoology: they occur, in fact, before he would view or name or know, in either epistemolog- ical or sexual senses, his wife. Francis Bacon notes this emphatically, observing that "the first acts which man SOCIAL RESEARCH, Vol. 62, No. 3 (Fall 1995)</page><page sequence="2">458 SOCIAL RESEARCH performed in Paradise consisted of the two summary parts of knowledge; the view of the creatures and the imposition of the names" (Advancement of Learning, I, vi 6). For Milton, this leads to a different matter entirely. For in the following lines Adam expresses the acute want of a name to give God. This is a subtle poetic move, and it is tempting to see in this the paradigm of a transition which would occur "later," in natural human history, with animistic or totemic idolatry becoming implicitly super- seded, and nature itself giving rise to a realm that transcends it. But Adam's Paradise was not yet a state of nature: the natural world only came into being with the fall. The first human signs of this new condition are Adam and Eve's feelings of sexual guilt and of being shamefully naked. Among the animals, the first predatory actions are seen: eagle and lion assert their new figurative reign over a kingdom of blood and pursue their prey. This implies that in the Unf채llen world, neither humans nor beasts were carnivores (XI, 185ff). It also seems clear that Milton feels that all the enmity among creatures- signs of the new state of nature in which Hobbes famously described the life of man as being "solitary, poor, nasty brutish and short"- also serve as complex emblems of how all natural life is constructed by death: ... we are dust, And thither must return and be no more. Why else this double object in our sight Of flight pursu'd in the air and on the ground One way the self-same hour . . . (XI, 200ff). But in the as yet Unf채llen world, neither animals nor humans need to be hunter-gatherers; there is no labor, of the hand or of childbearing, and the relation of beings to ambience is seamless. The animals are observed in another mode of activity, giving pleasure to themselves and to the humans who have named and understood them:</page><page sequence="3">"I NAMED THEM" 459 . . . About them [Adam and Eve] frisking played All beasts of th' earth, since wild, and of all chase In wood or wilderness, forest or den; Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw Dandl'd the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards Gambol'd before them, th'unwieldy elephant To make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreath'd His lithe proboscis . . . And indeed, this calls to mind a passage on the beauty of animals from Edmund Burke's A Philosophical Enquiry into Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful ( Part I Section X): " . .when other animals give us a sense of joy and pleasure in beholding them (and there are many that do so), they inspire us with sentiments of tenderness and affection toward their persons; we like to have them near us, and we enter into a kind of relation with them, unless we have strong reasons for the contrary." This formulation seems haunted by Milton's vision of the peaceable kingdom. And yet in the next sentence, Burke speaks for the fallen world, from a sense of almost Darwinian functionalism: But to what end, in so many cases, this was designed, I am unable to discover; for I see no greater reasons for a connection between man and several animals who are attired in so engaging a manner, than between him and others who entirely want this attraction, or possess it in a far weaker degree. But it is probable, that providence did not make even this distinction, but with a view to some great end, though we cannot perceive distinctly what it is, as his wisdom is not our wisdom, and our ways not his ways. In Paradise, man rules over the animals almost as primus inter pares: there is no agriculture, no livestock, no use to which living or dead animals are put, whether material, religious, or even imaginative. And significantly, there is no economic or culturally established distinction between wild and domestic creatures: the very need to draw one only comes into being with the Fall. What then, might we ask, of Adam's beholding the animals "after their kinds" and naming them as a result of</page><page sequence="4">460 SOCIAL RESEARCH his beholding? What would Unf채llen naming, and Unf채llen kinds, be like? Let us consider the matter of naming first. Philo of Alexandria, the first-century Platonist scriptural commentator, remarked that when Adam called out the name of an animal- say, the cow- for the first time, the cow responded to it as if she had known it all her life (Philo, 1929, I, pp. 1 16-19). As if, in other words, the name were part of her nature and its form a necessary one. By this Philo meant, among other things, to suggest that the first act of naming was not the arbitrary sort we do in the natural world, in which a name, whether conventional or ad hoc, is applied to something rather than having been somehow elicited by its very character. (Indeed, a rabbinic account of the same passage in Genesis maintains that the angels were ordained to name the newly created animals, "but they were not equal to the task. Adam, however, spoke without hesitation: 'O Lord of the World! The proper name for this animal is ox, for this one horse, for this one lion, for this one camel.' And he called all in turn by name, suiting the name to the peculiarity of the animal" (Ginzberg, 1909, I, p. 61-2). Today we might rather want to remark on another peculiarity of the naming of animals in Eden: the act is both a personal and an implicitly taxonomic one, in that the fauna in Paradise are unique specimens, the exemplars and templates for the species into which they are fruitfully to multiply. Adam's names may have been personal ones - "Here, ox!" "Nice horse!" and so on- but they were necessarily taxonomic in that there was at first only one pair of everything, and there was to be no subsequent renaming until, presumably, after the second fall, that of the Tower of Babel and the fracturing of a monolithic original tongue into human languages. Once in the natural world, we see proper names given to domestic animals or indeed to gods, whether animal-like, anthropomorphic- but often with emblematic or familiar animals accompanying them- or, as in Genesis, abstract. But species names are given,</page><page sequence="5">"I NAMED THEM" 461 as will be later observed, as proper names to humans in many cultures. Names can individuate, define, label or tag, interpret, classify, and so forth. Humans know their proper names; dogs and some horses recognize theirs; cats may appear to but not in the way dogs do- but this is part of the complex uncanniness of feline nature which is too complex to go into here. And certainly the role of assigning proper names to domestic or otherwise familiar animals is an act of crucial importance in constructing a unique kind of working relationship, even if the animal's work is simply to be there and to be itself with a particularly gratifying beauty. (I leave it to Vicki Hearne to deal with the importance of the relation between a human and a working dog as a paradigmatic one.) But it is the ways in which general names can invoke or construct systems of kind to which we might now turn. Many readers of literature, and- because of how much is made of it by Michel Foucault at the very opening of Les Mots et les choses -a good number of younger professional scholars, are acquainted with Jorge Luis Borges' citation of a grotesque taxonomy of what we would call the animal kingdom, purportedly from "a certain Chinese encyclopedia" (Borges, 1965, pp. 106-10; Foucault, 1973, p. xv). It gambols about among classes of species, genera of phylum, families of order, and so forth, but perhaps a crucial matter of what makes it so funny is the very rhythm of its narrative unfolding, and the way each accruing category seems to mock the very mode of category of the preceding ones. You may remember that the catalogue of classifications of animals goes as follows: "(a) those that belong to the Emperor, (b) embalmed ones, (c) those that are trained, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f ) fabulous ones, (g) stray dogs, (h) those that are included in this classification, (I) those that tremble as if they were mad, (j) innumerable ones, (k) those drawn with a very fine camel's hair brush (1) others, (m) those that have just broken a flower vase (n) those that resemble flies from a distance."</page><page sequence="6">462 SOCIAL RESEARCH The beauty of this play of classifying aside, another interesting question about kinds of kinds emerges, namely that of what kinds are for, anyway? Where we have a choice of assigning creatures to kind, we find taxonomies arising ad hoc to some pragmatic occasion. A revealing parallel to the Borgesian citation is provided by the old anecdote of the British railway baggage-clerk puzzling over the freight rates for a creature unlisted in his schedule: "Dogs is dogs and cats is dogs, and squirrels in cages is parrots, but this here turkle is a hinsect. No charge."3 And we are reminded that the hilarious and beautiful uncanniness of the list in the "certain Chinese encyclopedia" is the secondary puzzle that unfolds just beneath the surface of the primary one: not just "what sorts of kinds" govern the construction of this list, but also "for what possible purpose could these sorts of kind be conjured up and deployed?" (Is this pragmatic consideration characteristically absent from Foucault's discussion?) Or I recall E.O. Wilson remarking casually- and here it would be interesting to try to reconstruct the context, which I cannot remember- "I guess you could say that an ant is a small social wasp without wings." (With respect to what did he want to observe that you could say it?) But one can find fantastic taxonomy almost everywhere. A rabbinic commentary on Genesis 1.20 has it that one Quintus, a Roman general, asked Rabbi Johannan ben Zakkai: "One verse speaks of fowl as having been created out of the waters of the sea [let the waters bring forth abundantly . . .fowl that may fly above the earth]. But another verse speaks of them as having been created out of the earth [out of the ground the Lord formed every fowl of the air- 2.19]" Johannan ben Zakkai answered: "Both are true; fowl were created out of alluvial mud." On which Rabbi Samuel of Cappadocia commented: "Just the same, fowl are related to fish, for the skin of chickens' feet resemble the scale-covered skin of fish [and so fowl are considered fishlike."4 While arguments like this may have left their traces in Sephardic Jewish dietary laws</page><page sequence="7">"I NAMED THEM" 463 that ruled fowl not to be meat, as it was considered elsewhere, their remarkable improvisatory character, and the free play of analogy, can often seem like unintentional parody of biological taxonomies. Intentional parodies and anomalies, of course, begin to appear in poetry early on. From the point of view of our own conceptual and linguistic tradition, the very fabric of other languages seems like a kind of poetry. One language will romance another's idioms and modes (for example, Pound on Chinese pictograms and so on, even though we could apply this estrangement to ourselves diachronically). Even such nuances of usage as different prepositional idioms in somewhat related languages might be seen as performing as much of that contingent segmentation of nature as taxonomic vocabularies of any sort (not having a generic word for what we would call "ice" and other such sensational examples. R. Bulmer's fascinating essay, "Why Is the Cassowary Not a Bird"(1973) (at least, for the taxonomi- cally-marked language of the Karam of New Guinea), is only one of a host of explorations of the ways in which the animal realm is so variously and so remarkably mapped. Closer to our own linguistic home is the kindergarten story of language and culture that my generation learned from reading Scott's Ivanhoe. Consider the following pairs of English words: pig or swine/pork; sheep/mutton; calf/veal; ox or cow/beef- there is a total alignment of Norman French with butchered meat as opposed to Anglo-Saxon with animal on the hoof, and a record of historical cultural hegemony (who got to eat meat, who did not but provided it) was presumably inscribed in that pairing. (The ways in which these linguistic usages tempt us to construct models of cultural consciousness, one the one hand, and to model their basis in material practice, on the other, remains, of course, a central concern of various social sciences.) The issue of names of and for animals, and the ways in which they may or may not embody analyses of kind, might show up in a consideration of two versions of the topic, naively</page><page sequence="8">464 SOCIAL RESEARCH put, of "animals in the bible." The first would involve that fascinating relation between taxonomy and linguistics, scholar- ship which allows us to observe that in the entire Hebrew bible there seems to be only one general term- dagah -for "fish," but eleven different species of owl identified by different names.5 And, incidentally, no cats at all (it is thought that the mongoose was used against snakes and mice in its place.) This might be like a literary language in English that, in various texts composed over many centuries, had only the general term "bug" for all insects. The second question of "animals in the bible" engages a secondary taxonomy, a purely textual one. It would concern the literary uses to which animals were put, and the imaginative, poetic, or narrative constructions of creatures we find in all subsequent literary fiction. Most literally, domestic animals are naturalistically chronicled for their economic status; predatory and passive characteristics of other creatures are given ad hoc allegorizations in their nonce symbolic uses- such as in the associations of animals with the tribes of Israel in Genesis 49 or the use of animal metaphors in prophetic poetry or in the parables and proverbs of wisdom-literature. Probably unique in the Hebrew Bible is the wonderful fable of Balaam's ass (Numbers 22), who with characteristic asinine stubbornness shied away three times from an angel- invisible to her rider- that she saw blocking her path. Balaam beats her until, suddenly being given the gift of speech, she protests reasonably against the injustice of this; when he acknowledges it, he is able to see the messenger of the Lord who gives him a crucial mandate. The ass did all she could without the power of speech, and that was given her when her prudence was violently misconstrued. I am not a zoologist, nor a philosopher or historian of science, and I cannot speak in this case either for theories of ordering or for the many-structured profusion of living creatures. But as a poet I would like to talk about imaginative constructions of the animal kingdom (to call it that, of course,</page><page sequence="9">"I NAMED THEM" 465 implies either the rule of man, or, if the lion is the king of the beasts, he is viceregent). These constructions could be ranged along a spectrum of fictionality, as it were, from the greatest to the least acknowledgment of natural fact. (Would some reductive, post-Linnaean description framed as a genetic code be a contemporary extreme? After all, Linnaean names, for ages so central to the development of descriptive biology and more, may now seem to be quaint relics of an older heroic age- the inscription of a discoverer's name to mark a taxonomic difference- as opposed to an easily digitalized code.) Homer's enchantress, Circe, turned men into the beasts who served as conventional emblems of their behavior (Odysseus' men were turned into pigs, and he narrowly escaped becoming the fox that he- Homer calls him polytropon, "of many turns"- was so like). I have remarked elsewhere how in this regard she seems to be the first satirist, and that in any case she lays the groundwork for the more homely beast-fables in prose traditionally assigned to Aesop, of which more in a moment. The animals in Ovid's great poem about changes of shape, The Metamorphoses, are frequently forms taken by the Olympian Gods for their rapes of humans, a strange form of bestiality. (Satan, in Paradise Lost, incarnating himself in the serpent is made by Milton to be a prototype of all these, as well as a daemonic parody of the Christian incarnation.) On the other hand, Ovidian victims frequently become transformed into plants in his stories, as do the escaped objects of direct erotic pursuit (Daphne and Syrinx, for example). There are also animal-human transformations in creatures of popular folk- lore, like werewolves, cat-people, vampires- the result of internal enchantment- or fairly-tale frog-princes, and so on- the result of external enchantment. But Ovid has a poetic and satiric agenda based on marvelous particularity: Arachne was a superbly talented weaver whose skill was so great that the goddess Minerva, angered, destroyed her web; Arachne hanged herself by a strong thread and became metamor-</page><page sequence="10">466 SOCIAL RESEARCH phosed into a spider.6 His stories partake of aetiological fable of the sort that is always revisionary, first of prior fable and, later in history, of aetiologies squaring with some scientific model. Hegel in The Phenomenology of Mind talks about a stage in the history of consciousness represented by deities, such as Egyptian ones, with animal heads on human bodies, a sort of allegory of the blending of animal form with the higher symbolizing faculties of human thought (Hegel, 1967, p. 706). But this is also an excellent metaphor for the constructions of much of the animal kingdom by human knowledge and writing and visual representation before the paradigm of scientific zoology distinguished between lore (that word originally means "learning," by the way) and fact. The "lewd" (in the older sense of those without "lore") probably had access to a great deal of fact- in regard to domestic animals, for example, livestock, predators, all the creatures they lived and worked among- and pre-eighteenth-century illiteracy might frequently guarantee a higher level of empirical knowledge of animals and their ways. The world of writing and organized knowledge, so often mediated and indirect, consisting of so much hearsay before the dawn of the criterion of evidence, continually mythologized living creatures. The medieval bestiaries in the tradition of the allegorizing Physiologus, for example, interpreted the natures of actual and purely mythical creatures in the same way and with the same authority.7 A web of textual hearsay conflated beasts that you had never seen but knew of, and those that nobody ever could see. And, of course, literary fictions about animals do not have to compete with canonical biological knowledge about them until the end of the seventeenth century. In the history of many religious fictions, animals move from being Gods to being chimerical half-personed gods to residing</page><page sequence="11">"I NAMED THEM" 467 as ancillary to particular gods and then to attributes or emblems. Then there are mythological composite animals, and the point in mythographic history when composites like the Chimera and Pegasus form a fable of truth and falsehood (the triune monster, lies; the winged horse, poetry - itself far from literal, from zoologically normal- but you need to fly above the ground with Pegasus in order to kill falsehood!). There are so many different pre- or non-biological kinds of zoological taxonomy: those assigned, as in the passage in Genesis we started with, to the elements of air, earth, and water (thus, birds, beasts, and sea-creatures); creatures grouped by scale with respect to the human module; wild, tame, domestic. Among the wild, predator and prey, with human persons balanced between these; malignant and benign. Among the domestic, livestock- cattle, sheep, goats, horses, swine, fowl, bees, and so forth- working and companionable creatures; or- in various social conditions in various cultures- outdoor versus indoor. Or milch cows versus steers. But like Hegel's Egyptian statues, even the most natural of creatures can form a spooky composite with its mythical identity. Consider three groupings of creatures about which much has been said and written (for convenience sake, I shall keep to avian creatures here). They comprise: Class I: Phoenix, Roc, Tsits; Class II: Penguin, Oriole, Osprey- and we have no problem in differentiating the zoological realm here from the purely fictional one. But then consider the third grouping (whose membership I extend beyond a token three: Class III: Pelican, Eagle, Sparrow, Owl, Nightingale, Skylark (and, in the United States as a deliberately contrived analogue of these last two, Mockingbird). These are purely natural creatures which have, in the history of our texts and discourse over nearly three millennia, doubled as allegories. They inherit conventional readings derived from pure fiction, from natural fact, and from a blend of both. For example, the Pelican was considered in the bestiaries to be a type of Christ because it was falsely believed that she would stab her own breast to feed her</page><page sequence="12">468 SOCIAL RESEARCH young, thus becoming a type of self-sacrifice. On the other hand, the nightingale does indeed sing most beautifully out of the darkness. The skylark sings uncannily, almost invisibly, from such a height that it is hard to discern so small a speck as the source of so much song. The first comes to our literature trailing clouds of Ovid's remarkable story of the raped and silenced Philomela, who regains her voice only after metamor- phosis into a bird. The second, in a different context, is thought of as singing "at heaven's gate." Both become surrogates, in the poetry of the renaissance and after, for poetry itself. But this poetic taxonomy might extend further. Class I- the purely mythical beasts- might be broken down into orders, families, and genera. An ordering of fabulous creatures might start with a classification into simple and composite. Basilisks- Chimera (bad), Pegasus (good) (is it because a winged horse is not a riddling composite but simply an adapted horse, like a unicorn?) The Hippocampus, a mermaid-like conjunction of horse and fishtail (simply one of Neptune's steeds and unallegorized at all). On the other hand, there are what we might call recombinant composites, like the Hippogriff of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso -sired by a Griffin- itself a mythical composite, part lion part eagle- -upon an actual filly, but in another sense a revisionary descendent of Pegasus, but associated with love instead of with poetry. Yet again, the occasion of this very discussion might call for a crucial distinction, in the order of the mythical composites, between the animal composites and those that are part animal, part human. There is the amusing side-issue here of the occasions on which mythology eerily seems to anticipate scientific zoology, for example, in the case of the musician Arion, cast overboard like Jonah from a ship but rescued by a dolphin who was charmed by his playing; this is influenced by a mythological tradition by which dolphins were held to have been men originally: as the third-century Hellenistic poet Oppian put it</page><page sequence="13">"I NAMED THEM" 469 (as here translated in the eighteenth century by William Diaper): Dolphins were men (Tradition hands the Tale) Laborious Swains bred on the Tuscan Vale: Transform'd by Bacchus, and by Neptune lov'd They all the Pleasures of the Deep improv'd (Diaper, 1951, p. 162). Modern oceanography has itself become our new Arion. For Western poetry, there co-exist widely differing modes of signification in identifying people with animals. These can range from tribal totemic animals or characterological designa- tions to traditions of animal-names totally devoid of signifi- cance. The most obvious instance is the case of modern European surnames, for which common usage implicitly contracts to pretend that (and I shall only use English ones here) proper names like Trout, Pike, Roach, Tench, Salmon, and Bass are only homonyms of generic names of fish, and that to pun on them is crude. This has resulted from a wearing away, over time, of the signified animal (and, of course, a foreign name like Hecht will not even be recognized as that of a pike in the first place). More intriguing is the apparent practice in Gothic of naming children with a pair of animal names, devoid of any emblematic significance and seemingly random in their conjunction: an amusing instance is that of a girl's name, hroslind (hros + lind, horse + snake) , which got charmingly botanical when in Spain a romance language construed it as Rosalinda, or pretty rose.8 But animal names can also conjoin humans and beasts in a metaphorically potent way, and fictions can manipulate these in almost Aesopian fashion. The actual characters of animal fables themselves are caricatures not of beasts, but of the way characteristic vices lead humans to behave; nevertheless, they make pointed use of physical and ethological particularities of the animal species involved and are compounded equally of fictive wit and the results of careful observation. Nicholas Howe, in Fabling: Beasts:</page><page sequence="14">470 SOCIAL RESEARCH Traces in Memory (1995), has many enlightening things to say in the matter of beast-fable. I shall only observe here that what is crucial about the Aesopian creatures is that they talk. Which brings up the question of what enabled Adam to do the naming. We name animals, but if any of them name us- dolphins or gorillas, perhaps- the system has yet to be represented. The linguistic silence of the so-called dumb beasts has also been explained as post-lapsarian, which is to say, natural. The apocryphal Book of Jubilees (111,8) proclaims that on the day of Adam's expulsion from Paradise, "the mouths of all beasts were closed ... so that they could no longer speak. For they had all spoken one with another with one lip and with one tongue." It is as if, for all the animals, the human fall constituted their acutely undeserved Tower of Babel. The only two animals in the Hebrew Bible who speak are the serpent in Paradise and Balaam's ass, mentioned earlier. When human fictions cause animals to speak, they can question our own moral sensibilities in human society, and they can question our sensibilities with respect to animals them- selves-and perhaps also our previous constructions of and attitudes toward their natures: romantic, naturalistic-cum- visionary, modern, and so forth. Ovidian metamorphs may speak in Renaissance poetry as people, or as unique creatures (whether the first of their kind or merely exemplary of it). But only in the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries do poems start to get non-mythological first-person animal speakers, in which the persona of the lyric will be the bird or beast speaking of and for itself. And only then do encounters with animals in poems start to become moral showdowns, such as are seen in some of D.H. Lawrence's great poems from the volume called Birds, Beasts and Flowers, for example. Medieval fable has its heroes learning the language of animals and birds. Conversely, Virgilian pastoral poetry has, in his first eclogue, the poet inscribing meaningful sound in natural noise, playing on his pipe and teaching the woods to</page><page sequence="15">"I NAMED THEM" 471 echo the name of his girlfriend, Amaryllis (Virgil, Ecologue I, 4-5). Robert Frost's brilliant meditation on Milton's paradise in a sonnet called "Never Again Would Birds' Song Be the Same" has it that it was Eve's voice which imprinted the illusion of discourse- "Her tone of meaning, but without the words" on avian calls. Swift's great dialectic of the human and the humane, Houyhnhms and Yahoos: our animal and rational parts reversed- but a hint that too long a look outside of the Platonic cave of our own nature will make us inhumane in yet another way. There is a wonderful revisionary return of all this in the great tutelary animal fiction, at least in English. I am thinking not only of the tutelary animals in both Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass (and over a century of subsequent children's literature keeping alive the conventions of animal discourse) but even more of Kipling and T.H. White. In the Jungle Book, Mowgli, the enfant sauvage is raised by the wolf pack- a highly structured society- and tutored by others- panther, bear, python. In the great story called "Kaa's Hunting," a crucial dialectic distinction is drawn which reverses a popular taxonomic clich챕: the Bandar-log who abduct Mowgli are the monkeys, primates, and thus closer to humans: but the closeness is only to the worst part of our nature- greed, irresponsibility, air-headedness, disorder. And it is the far more distant wolves who are metaphorically citizens, and the monkeys who constitute the grotesque metonymy, or the satiric distortion. This perhaps goes back to the Swiftian dialectic that reverses Plato's passionate horse and rational rider in persons of the Houyhnhms and Yahoos mentioned earlier. The remarkable education in the theory and practice of appropriateness and decency that graces the boyhood of the once and future king in T.H. White's great The Sword in the Stone entails Merlin, the young Arthur's donnish tutor, turning him into a series of creatures- a tench in the castle moat, a hawk in the mews, an owl, among others- in a complex reversal of the usual post- Aesopian tradition.</page><page sequence="16">472 SOCIAL RESEARCH There is no time here to explore the world of animals who talk in fiction and, in particular, those who tell their own stories, like E.T.A. Hoffmann's wonderful Kater Murr, a tom-cat who scribbles his autobiography on the back of proof-sheets of a novel about the life of the musician Kreisler; Hoffmann's fiction is that a printer, not reading carefully, assembled a continuous intercalated narrative in which fragments of Murr's fly-on-the-wall view of uncertain events is apparently randomly interlarded with the tale of Kreisler. If Murr is perhaps the most inventive animal writer in the history of our literature it is because of Hoffmann's brilliant narrative invention which itself satirically revises and implicitly analyzes prior literary traditions of talking animals and beasts-as- humans and humans-as-beasts. Or there is Buck, the hero of Jack London's The Call of the Wild who, although he is not the narrator, has his consciousness and motives and inferences spoken for and of by an ordinary omniscient narrator. And I cannot resist mentioning the heartbreakingly beautiful and too little known story by James Agee called "A Mother's Tale," containing a marvelously framed miniature epic of a steer escaping from a slaughterhouse to journey westward again and tell the herd of what surely awaits them, narrated by a cow to a number of calves. Even in earlier poetry we can see arising a whole tradition of poetic play with our ambivalence about household pets, including conventionalizing a cat/dog enmity that in domestic practice is frequently not there; and a little epigram in the Greek Anthology by Agathias of Byzantium that bemoans the death of a poet partridge at the claws of- guess who- the cat is the precursor of a considerable number of such texts over the years, whether of cat and bird (for example, Emily Dickinson's acute observations in "She sees a bird- she chuckles . . .") or Gray's famous archly moralizing verses on the favorite cat drowned in a tub of goldfish. In this tradition, which ends up with the dreadful cat-flattening Tom and Jerry cartoons, it is always the feline who is at fault. Another more interesting</page><page sequence="17">"I NAMED THEM" 473 contemporary agenda has been raised by what I might call the contingent domesticity of television nature-film narratives. The remarkable technical skill involved in the making of these, and the mostly dignified reverence in which they seem to be framed, help to generate traps for our sentimentalities. We follow an animal mother or pair, watch the birth, growth, development, and education of their young, all speeded up across months of camera work and fictionalizing editing. The creatures are unceremoniously named by the narration, which under the complex visual circumstances makes them more familiar than any zoo-label name can do to its unfortunate bearer. But then, intercalated, is another Bildungsroman, that of a family, with its equally adorable and baptized young, of the first family's natural predators. And then we are shown the convergence of the twain, both of whom have been brought home to us. Many viewers look away as the maturing young Akbar chases and devours the graceful but unescaping Bonnie; but the moral of the story may really be that you do not deserve to cuddle up to the early spectacles unless you know the final unpleasantness is implicit in them and must not be denied. Perhaps it takes the most profoundly imaginative of human faculties to scrutinize the very limits of those faculties themselves. With respect to our constructions of quasi- personhood for animals, we must always know that they are our constructions. As for animals, we can acknowledge that they must generate their own unrationalized taxonomies: the carnivores among them, for example, distinguish among wild and domestic prey, enemies, a few friends and specific signifiers, and what must be simply lumped as mobile landscape. But we also- with great complexity- acknowledge that our own taxonomies of all sorts and our own readings of the nature and behavior and variously experienced presence of all the animals continually breeds new modes of allegory, and moral fable, and mythopoetic representation. With so many phases of poetic history interlayered with</page><page sequence="18">474 SOCIAL RESEARCH zoological interpretation, our continuing process of assessment of our relations to the other creatures has re-emerged for different reasons. But we keep coming back to new versions of Milton's sense of the fact that in our fall the animal world was, through no fault of its own, inevitably engaged and con- demned not only to be eaten, and kept, and put to work, and otherwise used, but to be studied and wondered at and contemplated and, if ever possible, understood. And yet at the same time we know that there will probably be thousands of creatures that- short of a total planetary demolition- will outlive us and our shortcomings, and who will evolve out of what we have done to ourselves and to their world. Animals may be thought of as sensing when they are near death, perhaps; but they do not know, as we do, that they will die. But perhaps these lines by the Scottish poet Edwin Muir put the matter best, with their glancing allusion to a Heideggerian formulation of human being as having been thrown onto it, and with their suggestion that whatever memories the beasts have, it is not like ours. I shall conclude with them. "The Animals" is from a book published in 1965 (pp. 207-8): They do not live in the world, Are not in time and space. From birth to death hurled No word do they have, not one To plant a foot upon, Were never in any place. For with names the world was called Out of the empty air, With names was built and walled Line and circle and square, Dust and emerald; Snatched from deceiving death By the articulate breath. But these have never trod Twice the familiar track, Never never turned back Into the memoried day.</page><page sequence="19">"I NAMED THEM" 475 All is new and near In the unchanging Here Of the fifth great day of God, That shall remain the same, Never shall pass away. On the sixth day we came.9 Notes 1 He had a pocket edition. He seems to have taken Lyell's Geology, the Bible, and Humboldt. See Desmond and Moore, 1991, p. 129; Moorehead, 1969, p. 39.

Actually, from a Punch cartoon of 1869 titled "Zoology," although my source (and that of others who remember the quotation but not where they read it) gives the line in the slightly but significantly different form which I quote. (In Punch: "Dogs is dogs and Cats is 'dogs' and rabbits is 'dogs' and so's parrots; but this 'ere 'tortis' is a insect, so there ain't no charge for it." See Williams, 1955, p. 116.) Quoted in Bialik and Ravnitzky, 1992, p. 12, where the rabbinic sources are given. Speciation [?] in the textual world of encyclopedias is an interesting matter. In Conrad Gesner's important Historia Animalium of the 1560's, there are twenty-odd varieties of dog, for example, more than of any other species. The storv of Arachne is told in Metamnrtohnsps. VI. Pi- 14.^ 7 Even Gesner's progressive zoological agenda, which causes him to demystify a "supposed beast" (I quote from Edward Topsell's translation of a century later) like the Cacus, allows him to discuss the unicorn at some length, as well as a number of other mythical human-animal composites, many of which he discusses under a erenerai class of aoes. 8 See the discussion bv Withvcombe. 1977. n. 257.
