<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward a Third Testament: Michel Tournier's Attempt to Re-appropriate the Sacred WALTER STRAUSS Case Western Reserve University Michel Tournier described himself once as a "metaphysically suntanned" novelist; he could just as aptly have said "religiously windswept" because he is inspired--literally speaking-by the Paraclete Wind, that Esprit Cre- ateur which is celebrated in the medieval hymn "Veni, Creator Spiritus" and whose second stanza goes like this: Qui diceris Paraclitus Who art called the Paraclete Altissimi donum Dei, Gift of the highest God Fons vivus, ignis, caritas Living spring, fire, love et spiritualis unctio And spiritual unction Tournier's third novel was to be centered precisely on this pneumatic and life-giving Comforter-Wind. Its present title, Les Metiores, still retains more than a trace of its original intention, implying a general complex of me- teorological conditions (not merely meteors)--climate, weather, the ele- ments, but particularly the "aerial" forces impinging on the other ele- ments-comes closer to the novel's intended mythological scope. Concern- ing this mythological and religious dimension, Tournier has this to say: It was to have been of major importance and to justify the original title Le Vent Paraclet announced at the time Le Roi des aulnes [The Ogre] came out. My initial plan envisaged a resacralization of celestial phenomena by merging theology and meteorology, the one bringing the spirit, the sacred, the divine and the other the very concrete poetry of rain, snow and sun. The point was to efface the two different implications of the word ciel-sky, atmosphere and sojourn of God and the blessed [i.e., heaven], and to link up with the solar cult sketched out at the end of Vendredi [Friday] (VP 260).' [This is a reference to the Robinson Crusoe- Friday dialectic which subsumes earthbound and airborne polarity into the synthesis of "solarity."] The fact that this attempt at "resacralization" did not succeed in Les Mi- tiores, and that Tournier admits that "the novel has developed in a much</page><page sequence="2">76 South Central Review too profane direction" (VP 261), seems to me largely to have deferred, not abolished, the question-which is: how to make the modem novel once more into a vast symbolic-mythological structure of meanings? Tournier's problem is similar to Proust's and Mann's and Musil's and Broch's: how to make the novel "philosophical" without sacrificing its identity as a nar- rative genre? Anthropology, meteorology, philosophy and theology all have their impact on Les Metiores but without bringing about a satisfactory synthesis. Thus, the notion of the "ideal" existence of twins as "interces- sors" between earth and sky, between female and male-much of this derived from Sir James G. Frazier and possibly from Mircea Eliade-was originally intended as the ground from which this resacralization would proceed, and it clearly points in the direction of a mediation by the Holy Spirit, which, in Tournier's projected theology, more and more takes the place of Jesus Christ. Of the Paraclete wind (the Holy Spirit restored to meteorology) I expected a double metamorphosis into flesh and into words. The third person of the Trinity in effect assumes the fecundation of the Virgin Mary, then the gift of tongues to the Apostles, these interventions being consummated by the feasts of the Annunciation and Pentecost, respectively. (VP 261) Does that mean that the time is not ripe for this new integration, for this new-the third-"gospel," or is such an undertaking beyond Tournier's powers? There is a fascinating background, to some extent unfamiliar, to sustain Tournier's ambitious project. It has a great deal to say about the neglect (or possibly misunderstanding?) of the Holy Spirit in the history of Western thought; and at the same time-and here is the real thrust of Tournier's argument-a great deal to offer to a world in which Christianity, indeed, all religion, is in a state of exhaustion and the victim of political manipulation and abuse. It could be argued that the history of Christian theology itself is to blame, since it neutralized and weakened the concept of the Holy Spirit. Traditionally, the Holy Spirit is the element of creative energy in religion; it establishes law and it breaks law: it is both conserva- tive and revolutionary. The Holy Spirit is a free, spontaneous energy, whether it manifests itself in the descent of the dove, or the ritual of the laying on of hands, or the gift of speaking in tongues-all these attributes point toward creation and fecundation on the one hand, and toward com- forting: ruach/pneuma as well as parakleitos. Since "the wind bloweth where it listeth," it has its own order and its own anarchy. It is precisely the restric- tion of the anarchistic elements that characterize the history of the Church from St. Paul on-for perfectly comprehensible reasons; and yet, by a kind of dialectic, the Holy Spirit has always been invoked by reformative and revolutionary factions within the Church; in most cases these pentecostal movements have taken the "charismatic" form ("grace-giving"-anything but the modem fundamentalist and quasi-totalitarian meaning attached to</page><page sequence="3">Walter Strauss 77 that word) associated with the Paraclete. Among these movements the most provocative and, in a sense, closest to Tournier, is the theological rebellion inherent in the Franciscan movement of the thirteenth century, and specifically Joachim of Flora's (1131-1202) op- position to the feudalized and rigidified institutions of the Church. An- ticipating in some ways the unorthodox historical thought of Giambattista Vico, Joachim projects a new "spiritual" interpretation of the Old and New Testaments, with a view toward a third, an "Eternal" Gospel (as it was to be designated fifty years later). The three dispensations are those of the Father, the order of scientia; that of the Son, the order of salentia (ex parte); and that of the Spirit, the order of plenitudo intellectus. The details of Joachite theological and apocalyptic thinking are not significant in the present context, since Tournier invents his own version of the third Gospel, which contains a generous admixture of Spinozistic immanence and of Marxist materialistic historical thinking. For Tournier, the Paraclete is closely bound up with nature's elements and energies (hence the reverence toward Spinoza) and with the creative/destructive forces within history. A superb illustration of Tournier's position is put into the mouth of the pentecostal abb6 Thomas Koussek, who in a long discourse outlines the pneumatic/paracletic vision of the third Dispensation. The argument, quite original and audacious, takes its departure from two key New Testa- ment passages. The first is the famous descent of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2.1-4. ... when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. 2. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 3. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. 4. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. The principal emphasis that Koussek gives to this passage lies in the gust- like coming down of the Spirit; and the emphasis on the property of fire as- sociated with it; and, finally, the gift of a particular kind of speech. The con- tinuity of Spirit, wvebca, with the Hebrew ruach (1r-11)3 is pivotal in this argument: "Ruach is the Hebrew word traditionally translated as wind, breath, void, spirit" (G 113); and by means of several supplementary quota- tions, Koussek argues that "meteorology and ruach are closely linked," most particularly in a passage from I Kings 19.11-13, in which the prophet Elijah is visited by Yahweh accompanied by meteorological phenomena, though not contained within them (wind, earthquake, fire) but rather by a mur- muring voice that comes to him after the natural forces; that is, Yahweh is not in the natural forces, but his Spirit is.</page><page sequence="4">78 South Central Review The Holy Spirit is wind, tempest, breath, it has a meteorological body. Meteors are sacred. Science, which claims to analyze them thoroughly and encapsulate them in laws, is nothing but blasphemy and mockery. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth," Jesus said to Nicodemus. That is why meteorology is doomed to failure. Its forecasts are continually made to look foolish by events, because they are an at- tack on the free will of the Spirit. Nor should there be any surprise at this sanctity I claim for meteors. Truly, everything is sacred. To try to divide things into a profane, material domain and the sacred world floating above it, is simply to confess to a degree of blindness and to define its limits. The mathematical sky of the astronomers is sacred because it is the home of the Father. The lands of men are sacred because they are the place of the Son. In between the two, the confused and unpredictable sky of meteorology is the place of the Spirit and forms a link between the paternal heavens and filial earth. It is a living, sounding sphere which envelops the earth like a mantle, full of humors and turbulence, and this mantle is spirit, seed, and word. "It is seed because without it nothing would grow on earth." "It is word, and the stormy troposphere with which it envelops the earth is in truth a logosphere." (G 114-15) The second component of Koussek's argument is highly problematical; it rests on a very personal interpretation of John 20-24: "Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came" (em- phasis mine). This Thomas Didymus is, of course, better known as Doubt- ing Thomas. The audacious argument proffered by Thomas Koussek is that Thomas must have been the twin brother of Jesus himself (since no other explanation is given) and that his desire to have proof of Jesus' wounds constitutes a need for "the mystical experience of a bodily communion, a penetration of his own body into the body of the beloved" (G 110). Thus the theme of twinship, carnal identity (note once more the English title given to this novel: Gemini), is reinforced by Thomas Koussek's hunger for a mystical (re-)union with Christ, but under the "meteoric" sign of the Pen- tecost: "The flaming wind of the Paraclete devastated and illumined my heart" (G 116). Foundation of a new creed, a new apostolic mission issu- ing out of the Book of Acts and out of Joachim of Flora? Here we arrive at the crux (better "storm center"!) of Koussek/ Tournier's thought: Christ has to be superseded. The great mistake made by Western Chris- tianity is in too exclusive an attachment to the person, the teaching, even to the body of Christ. We make ourselves guilty of Christocentrism, and even of Christomonism. . . . What we must accept is that Christ died because his mission was finished, and that mission was to prepare for the descent of the Holy Ghost among men. (G 111-12) The argument addresses squarely the question of the virtual displacement</page><page sequence="5">Walter Strauss 79 of the Father by the Son and the neglect of the Spirit in Western Christianity; as a mater of fact, the diatribe attacks one of the major causes of the East- West Schism, namely, the filioque controversy: This rejection of the primacy of the Spirit by the Roman Church is at the root of the Eastern Schism. The quarrel over the filioque is not a matter of words. The official symbol of the faith affirmed that the Spirit pro- ceeded from the Father-and this fundamental dogma cemented the unity of the Christian world. By adding the word filioque (and of the Son) in the eighth century, Rome made the Holy Ghost subservient to the Son and inscribed Christocentrism in the heart of the faith. The Eastern Church, faithful to the revolution of Pentecost, could not accept this ar- bitrary act which tended to make Christ the begetter of the Spirit whereas he was only the precursor. (G 113) Saint Augustine himself had asserted that S. . the Holy Spirit, whatever it is, is something common both to the Father and Son. But that communion itself is consubstantial and co-eter- nal; and if it may fitly be called friendship, let it be so called; but it is more aptly called love.4 Augustine later identified the Trinity as not three wisdoms but one wis- dom,5 and this brings us back to Tournier's basic question posed in Le Vent Paraclet: "What has become of wisdom? Sophia, sapientia, wisdom, Weis- heit" (VP 283). The implicit answer is, in all likelihood, the Pentecostal dis- pensation; Jesus was but the second John the Baptist, preparing the way for Paraclete: "Because it was necessary first for the Word to be made Flesh so that afterward we might be able to receive the Holy Ghost, or, as St. Athanasius said, God became sarcophorous in order that man might be- come pneumatophorous" (155). Tournier's next novel Gaspard, Melchior et Balthazar (1980) (The Four Wise Men, 1982) leaves behind the large-scale objectives as well as the car- nivalesque manner of the two preceding works: it is a retelling of an old tale, but with a difference; it is more controlled and more tightly organized, like the anthropological novel Vendredi. The one feature of Tournier the novelist that Gaspar, Melchior et Balthazar brings to full prominence is its author's very evident delight and admirable skill in telling tales. The tale of the Magi generally attracts tellers of fairy-tales, and Tournier likes fairy- tales-witness his Le Coq de bruytre (1978), translated into English as The Fetishist, (1984), and his various children's books. This particular retelling of the story of the Magi, like certain other modem variations of the legend, proposes Tournier's own version. It involves the invention of a fourth Magus, as the English title of the book makes clear; for this there are a num- ber of precedents. The novel is not "pentecostal" in the narrow sense. Rather, we have here</page><page sequence="6">80 South Central Review the creation of what seems to be an intermediate figure--one situated, so to speak, between the Second and Third Testaments-whose name is Taor Malek, from the Far East ("Mangalore," on the Malabar Coast). The name of this fourth king suggests, despite his Indian provenance, the Hebrew "tahor," meaning pure, and possibly alludes to the Tao, "the way." And, of course, "Malek" is related to the Semitic word for king.8 This Taor must learn to undergo the hardships of life, a special kind of rite de passage into abjection, which takes him from the saccharinity of his spoiled former ex- istence (the motivation for his westward journey is to discover the recipe for rahat loukoum!) to the salt mines of Sodom: from kingship to abject humility. Taor is the magus who comes too late: he misses the infant Jesus in Bethlehem; and after thirty-three years in the salt mines, he arrives too late for the Last Supper. But in recompense for his suffering and per- severance he is the first "ordinary" man to receive the bread and wine: Taor's head reeled. Bread and wine! He reached for a goblet and raised it to his lips. He picked up a piece of unleavened bread and ate it. He then toppled forward, but he did not fall. The two angels, who had been watching over him since he left the salt mines, gathered him into their great wings. The night sky opened, revealing a sea of light, and into it they bore the man who, after having been last, the eternal latecomer, had just been the first to receive the Eucharist. (FWM 249) This Taor is surely intended to be a precursor or even a mediator for the Testament of the Holy Spirit, or even, as one commentator has perceptive- ly suggested, "an incarnation"; and, still more recently, the novel La Goutte d'or (1985), carries this theme of humiliation into the contemporary world of the North African immigrant workers in France.9 In the Sodomitic view all elevated vision was converted into fundamen- tal analysis,'0 all ascendance into penetration, all theology into ontology, and the joy of acceding to the light of intelligence was frozen by the angst of the nocturnal researcher, who excavates the foundations of being. (FWM 239) Thus the Four Wise Men serves an important function for Tournier of prepar- ing the ground for the resacralization of our life--of this life--by refocus- ing the Sacred squarely upon the human, upon the sensuous/artistic, and in a conjunction of transcendence and immanence, not a disjunction. The enterprise is radical, despite its conventional components (it is radical in order to conserve!). Karl L6with's observations at the end of his interpreta- tion of Joachim de Flora are pertinent here: One can hardly deny that Christianity has always been at its best when it was in such a critical, discriminating situation, when it was attacked</page><page sequence="7">Walter Strauss 81 and had to defend itself: first against Jews and pagans (St. Paul), then against heresies (Tertullian and Augustine), then against Averroism (St. Thomas), then against the clerical church (Joachim) and the scholastic Aristotelianism (Luther), then against Cartesian rationalism (Pascal), and eventually against its own historical "success" through secularization (Kierkegaard). The trouble with contemporary Christianity is precisely that there is no genuine paganism, neither in Europe nor in America, against which Christianity could once more become what it was. Since our world is nominally Christian and actually secular, one has to "intro- duce Christianity into Christendom," to use a phrase of Kierkegaard.1 Perhaps the answer is to aim for an integration of the secular with what is left of monotheism. Tournier's aspiration toward a Third Gospel may be understood as a striving toward a marriage of sky and earth, spirit and mat- ter, under the aegis of Christianity, perhaps as a viable alternative to Nietzsche's anthropocentric neo-paganism. (Lo with remarks, "It needed a sacrifice like that of Nietzsche to re-establish, in an 'Antichrist,' the Chris- tian alternative between the Kingdom of God and the world, between crea- tion with consummation and eternal recurrence without beginning and end."12) In that sense, and perhaps only in that sense, Tournier's attempt at a resacralization along the lines of a Third Gospel-which is no longer quite that of Joachim-is a response to the depletion of the Sacred in our time. The fact that Tournier's vision involves the grotesque mode of the car- nival is not surprising if we accept L6with's context. "Laughter is a good way of knowing that you are getting close to the absolute" (VP 153): humor and celebration go hand in hand (VP 196), and humor may even go out of bounds. I have said that my novels are just so many attempts to transcribe a core of metaphysics into images and stories. Well, it's perfectly true that on- tology, once it has been tossed into the crucible of the novel, becomes par- tially metamorphosed into scatology! And that melting pot is not a pure- ly negative one; you can't just turn away your eyes and forget it. On the contrary, it is loaded with meaning and delicately structured. (VP 265) There is even a hint in Les Mgttores that the pneumatological vision of Thomas Koussek involves the creation of a new language, "a heavy lan- guage whose words are the very seeds of things and not their partial and deceptive reflections, as the words of human language are deceptive" (VP 262). Whether Tournier's future writings can go beyond the threshold he has already crossed and venture further into the windy spaces of his new mansion is one of the intriguing problems which will engage his full resour- ces.</page><page sequence="8">82 South Central Review NOTES 1 All references to Michel Tournier's books cited in this article will be as follows: VP-Le Vent Paraclet (Paris: Gallimard, 1977); trans. by the Author. G-Gemini, trans. Ann Carter (New York: Doubleday, 1981). FWM--The Four Wise Men, trans. Ralph Manheim (New York: Doubleday, 1984). 2 Joachim's treatise is known as Tractatus super quatuor Evangelia (edited by Ernesto Buon- aiuti, Rome 1930, No. 67 of the series Fonti per la Storia d'Italia and published by the Istituto Storico Italiano). Buonaiuti, in discussing Joachim, has this to say: "L'ultima ora della secon- da eta e suonata. Gioacchino e profondamente convinto d'assistere all'aurora della terza, di cui egli e l'antesignano predestinato" (lvi). Joachim argues, from the genealogy given in Math- ew 1.8, with reference back to the Book of Kings, that the time was ripe for a new dispensa- tion: "ut appareret quod prope esset tempus in quo oporteret emarcescere regnum carnis, con- fortari autem regnum Spiritus sancti, qui post mortem istorum regum implevit corda pro- phetarum ut annuntiarent adventum Christi in mundum pro quo dicit apostolus: 'factus est primus Adam in animam viventem, secundus Adam in spiritum vivificantem'"' (Tractatusl3). The phrase "secundus Adam"here appears to be a variant of the Vulgate form novissimus. (The Greek says t&gt;axaroc.) This dichotomy is echoed in King James ("the last") and R.S.V. ("the second"). (Personal and thematic parallels with Tournier are striking here: Tournier's concern with sophia and sapientia over against mere scientia; his monkish existence in the Chevreuse valley near Paris; and indeed the "phoric" concern with children, nature, animals, that is reminiscent of the Franciscans. The parallels are not exact, but they are too close to be ignored.) 3 This strong linkage of nve6ga and 11-1 is extremely fascinating. It suggests to the Chris- tian Michel Tournier a direct bond from the Old Testament to the Third Testament, in effect by bypassing the Son (" . . les Juifs pourraient sans doute passer directement de la ruah de l'- Ancien Testament au souffle lumieux de l'Esprit pentec6tiste" M 160); that is to say that the Jews have avoided the trap of Christocentrism. Is this perhaps a way of bringing together the Gospels and Spinoza, whom Tournier regards as the only worthy successor-as a religious thinker, one assumes--of the Scriptures? If one can regard Spinoza's philosophy as the ul- timate overcoming of anthropomorphic tendencies that appear to be inevitable in popular or institutionalized monotheism (despite the Second Commandment), is it not true that Spinoza preserves the abstraction and concretion of God by equating him with nature, particularly with natura naturans; nature spiritualized and creative? What Tournier aspires to as a pentecostalist, Spinoza has already "prefigured" philosophically, and with genuine enthusiasm. (A portion of the argument concerning the Old Testament foundations of the Holy Spirit comes from Daniel Lys, R2ach. Le Souffle dans l'Ancien Testament: Enquite anthropologique a travers l'histoire thdologique d'Isral [Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1963: 15-24 and 329-63]). Thomas Koussek actually mentions "le th6ologien David Lys" on 156; this seems to be a slip of the pen for "Daniel"). 4 Whitney J. Oates, ed., Basic Writings of St. Augustine (New York: Random House, 1948), 2: 765. 5 Basic Writings of St. Augustine, 2: 771. 6 "J'avoue bien volontiers que j'ai 6t6 d6borde fabricando par ce personnage un peu trop voyant et envahissant" (VP 258). 7 Tournier mentions two such sources: Henry Van Dyke and Edzard Schaper. The Van Dyke story is entitled The Story of the Other Wise Men (New York: Harper, 1906); the fourth magus is a Median called Artaban, who comes too late and looks for Jesus and never finds him during all the 33 years of his quest but in the process lives and dies in imitatione Christi. The Schaper novel is entitled Der vierte Kdnig, who had seen salvation and then migrated to Russia and still lives there during World War II in a monastery, totally removed from reality and history, from which he disappears as mysteriously as he had come. Evidently these two models served Tournier merely as incentives for his own tale.</page><page sequence="9">Walter Strauss 83 8 But there are other possibilities, whether intentional or not. "Malek" is close enough to pun with the Hebrew word for "angel" as well as the word for "salt"--a very pertinent likelihood, or at least a startling coincidence. 9 Susan Petit, "Salvation, the Flesh, and God in Michel Tournier's Gaspar, Melchior et Bal- thazar," Orbis Litterarum 41 (1986): 64. 10 Is this intended as a (splendidly!) obscene pun? 11 Karl L6with, Meaning in History (Chicago: U. of Chicago P, 1949) 157-58. 12 L6with, 159.</page></plain_text>
