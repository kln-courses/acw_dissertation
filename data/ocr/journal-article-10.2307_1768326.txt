<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORTHODOXY AND AESTHETIC METHOD IN PARADISE LOST AND THE DIVINE COMEDY ILLIAM J. GRACE WORK of art has its own validity as something that has been fash- ioned and created; one of the main functions of criticism at all times is to state and rediscover what the work of art actually is. But a work of art not only has this type of validity-it also serves as a touchstone of intellectual and cultural history. It both influences the course of cultural history and serves to mark, through the changing aspects of criticism it undergoes, the new elements and changes in that history.l Paradise Lost has permanently influenced the course of cultural his- tory, and serves as a touchstone of the changing directions and eddies of subsequent history. From the viewpoint of the orthodox-minded crit- ic (one who believes that there exists a permanent core of ascertainable truth guaranteed not only by reason but also by revelation), Paradise Lost undergoes a radically different evaluation than from the view- point of a more secular-minded critic who does not regard the material that Milton presents as having any connection with factuzal history at all. The second critic regards the material that Milton presents as a myth that, for historical reasons outside the question of the authen- ticity of the story altogether, once had a sacred character. From' the viewpoint of such scholarship the ideal way to handle Paradise Lost is not to commit oneself to the truth or falsehood of the historical ma- terial that Milton handles. This procedure requires a certain delicacy and discrimination because, while the prevailing temper of our time is agnostic and positivist, there are considerable vestigial groups, both Protestant and Catholic, who actually believe that Milton is treating 1 The fact of this changing criticism is well established in Dr. Maurice Kelley's This Great Argutment (Princeton, 1941), ch. 8. Dr. Kelley makes a powerful argument for historicity in criticism as against "critical mysticism." "Poetry, according to the exponents of this approach, is the expression of personality; and in reading it, the critic communes so intimately with the poet's real self that noth- ing outside of the poetry can be allowed to intrude or modify the critic's intui- tive discoveries." Obviously scholarship cannot support an extreme subjectivity of this sort. On the other hand, we can carry historicity too far, because a crea- tive work involves both transcendent and unconscious forces which are not necessarily limited to a historical relationship. [173]</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE a subject matter that is historical as well as aesthetic. In this respect, the fact that Milton himself thought he was writing history under the guid- ance of the Holy Spirit is of some relevance.2 In this paper we assume that the main events with which Milton deals actually happened; that Milton's presentation of them, there- fore, bears responsibility to history and to religion; and, moreover, that Milton himself believed that Paradise Lost was a work of history rather than of fiction. Milton actually believed that he was adding historic de- tails to the Scriptures. It is a touchstone of the degree to which our civilization has departed from orthodox tradition that it is now re- garded as a singularity to assume that the theological thought of Mil- ton or Dante should be taken seriously, though in Milton's own time, and well up into the nineteenth century, it would have been extraordi- nary to have thought otherwise. It is the thesis of this paper that Mil- ton's special difficulties and achievements in Paradise Lost depend upon the fact that Milton is dealing with theological history and is attempt- ing to present the facts of history at first hand, and not, as in the case of Dante, through the more veiled and indirect allegorical method and by means of a personal and symbolic travelogue. Milton's "theory of accommodation" does not basically alter the fact that he believed he was beholding and revealing special truth. His allegory of Sin and Death belongs to myth, for example, but in the main Milton assumes that only the limitations of human thought and language stand between his audi- ence and the directions of the Spirit.3 2 Milton's calling upon the Spirit to illumine him at the beginning of the Para- dise Lost is to be taken at its face value. There is no historical reason for assum- ing that such an invocation is merely conventional. Milton, it is likewise to be remembered, is nearer in point of time than the modern critic to the strong Aris- totelian distinction between creative writing and history, though, in his period, this distinction is beginning to be confused. The Spirit is, of course, the "in- dwelling of God" in the heart of the true believer, not the Holy Ghost. 3 "This idea, the so-called 'theory of accommodation,' fitted well with Milton's Platonism and lent support to his confidence in the authenticity of his own in- spiration. He had early conceived of himself as a revealer of truth in the Platonic sense. Poetic myth was the only possible way of representing the 'ideas' to human apprehension and only the poet-seer who had looked on the face of truth unveiled could so represent them." J. H. Hanford, A Milton Handbook (New York, 1946), p. 227. It might be asked, what is the position of a reader who does not share the theological position of a poet? T. S. Eliot in speaking of Dante in Selected Essays states without hesitation: "I deny, in short, that the reader must share the beliefs of the poet in order to enjoy the poetry fully. I have also asserted that we can distinguish between Dante's beliefs as a man and his beliefs as a poet." Yvor Winters in "T. S. Eliot or The Illusion of Reaction," The Anatomy of Reaction (Norfolk, Conn., 1934), quarrels with Eliot's stand. Winters says: "The non-Christian, however, might easily share a wide community of belief with Dante. The portraits of the damned are portraits of human beings, represented in Hell as they might be seen in life, suffering for sins most of which are ac- knowledged to be sins by intelligent men, whether Christian or not. As we pro- 174</page><page sequence="3">PARADISE LOST AND THE DIVINE COMEDY I Macaulay, with all his shortcomings as a critic, had one merit-he had a sense of perspective and really saw a sound basis for the com- parison of Milton with Dante, especially in his emphasis on the Divine Comedy as a personal narrative, extraordinarily concrete in tone and method, in contrast to the more abstract technique of Milton. Macau- lay's essay, of course, will not bear minute critical examination, as W. J. Courthope has so well and amusingly pointed out in his paper, "A Consideration of Macaulay's Comparison of Dante and Milton."4 Nevertheless, the possibility of the comparison always remains stimu- lating, for Dante is pre-eminently a poet of orthodoxy, and may serve as a standard of orthodoxy for Milton in Paradise Lost. Actually, orthodoxy in the handling of theological material has a close relation- ship to aesthetic method. One point that Macaulay observed he did not sufficiently penetrate. It is true that Dante's aesthetic method is more concrete; but, curiously enough, the sense of mystery is deeper in Dante than in Milton. Milton, emphasizing rational and discursive approaches, tends toward a rationalistic absence of mystery; but Dante, following the method of representative symbolism rather than of explanation, leaves mystery unimpaired. C. S. Lewis maintains that, regardless of the orthodoxy of Milton's position in his other works, his thought in Paradise Lost, with one or two minor and insignificant exceptions, is orthodox: In so far as Paradise Lost is Augustinian and hierarchical it is also Catholic in the sense of basing its poetry on conceptions that have been held "always and everywhere and by all." This Catholic quality is so predominant that it is the first impression that any unbiased reader would receive. Heretical elements are in it, but are only discoverable by search: any criticism which forces them into the foreground is mistaken, and ignores the fact that this poem was accepted as orthodox by many generations of acute readers well grounded in theology.5 Lewis, in contrast to Hilaire Belloc in his Milton, gives a thorough and documented support to this thesis, and convinces the orthodox reader that Milton is an outstanding poet comparable to Dante. Belloc discovers that Milton's views in The Christian Doctrine are heretical and opposed to the Protestant, as well as the Catholic, position, and tends to find the same subversive ideas in everything that Milton wrote; we are presented with a caricature of Milton that seems to make him only significant as an extraordinarily gifted craftsman. C. ceed, however, toward the final vision of beatitude, we find ourselves dealing with concepts which are more and more purely Christian, and it is more than likely that only the convinced Christian can feel the poetry at something like its full value..." 4 Published in Proceedings of the British Academy, 1907-08. 5 Preface to Paradise Lost (Oxford, 1942), p. 81. 175</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE S. Lewis is more penetrating and more sympathetic than Belloc, but he also seems to stretch certain points, and overlooks the degree to which Milton's actual aesthetic method leads him at least to heterodox effects. It is well to remember that an artist does not always succeed in placing his concept of form on matter; the matter may be so re- calcitrant and difficult that it will alter the artist's formal intention. In this sense, a case may be presented to show that Paradise Lost actually influenced Milton's own theology. In the examination of Milton's aesthetic method we may find a useful critique of what can and cannot be successfully done to convey theological truth through art. Up to and including the Renaissance, the distinction between his- tory and such arts as, for example, tragedy, was clearly understood. History dealt with factual truth, literature with imaginative truth. Forms such as those of the mediaeval religious drama, or the "true histories" of Shakespeare, intended to abide by scientific authenticity.6 An artist, especially in dealing with Scripture, was literal and exact. He did not feel free to add to, or even to interpret, what was literally set forth in the Scripture. Probably Milton himself would not have felt free in this sense if he had not sincerely believed that truth was avail- able to the elect in the light of right reason and that, under the guidance of the Spirit, one might come to know God's secret will and secret truth, as well as His will and truth clearly expressed to all.7 Milton does not hesitate to put into the mouth of the Deity speeches for which there is no Scriptural warrant, but which Milton considers suitable for Him. The Spirit, instructing the "upright heart and pure," is the divine inspiration which Milton sincerely believed guided him to utter new truths, Scriptural and historical truths, not merely imaginative truths. Paradise Lost is a work of illumination in the late Augustinian and Averroistic sense.8 From the viewpoint of the observer who does not 6 Lily B. Campbell gives an interesting account of Renaissance theories of history in her Shakespeare's "Histories"--Mirrors of Elizabethan Policy (San Marino, Cal., 1947). 7 Milton assumes that there is a reservoir of truth, perfectly consistent with the truth that God has made known to man, but as yet unrevealed. In this as- sumption lies Milton's nearest approach to the Catholic concept of mystery. Milton believes that certain privileged beings may come to know this reserved truth through special inspiration. In Paradise Lost (Books XI and XII) Michael, for example, communicates truths to Adam which are not suitable for Eve to know. 8 Arthur Sewell in A Study in Milton's Christian Doctrine (Oxford, 1939) stresses the fact that Milton, in connecting "reason" with "true liberty," has in mind "supernatural" reason as distinct from "unregenerate" natural reason, which is merely negative or utilitarian. "True Liberty, true value in conduct can only be grounded in a knowledge of spiritual things, in faith in God. This knowledge is not given to man by the natural reason; no amount of argument will discover it for him. The true illumination of the mind comes from those supernatural facul- ties which are infused into the regenerate from above . . . The effect of regenera- tion is an utterly new state of mind in which man is able to make his own judg- 176</page><page sequence="5">PARADISE LOST AND THE DIVINE COMEDY believe that'Milton's theology is altogether sound, Milton appears, on the other hand, to have confused history and imaginative interpretation, ment of what is the Will of God, simply because through faith he knows some- thing of the nature of God" (pp. 187-188). A historical note is relevant here in regard to the theological difficulty of reconciling the claims of reason with the claims of grace and of "illumination," which is organically allied with the idea of grace. Christopher Dawson in Medi- eval Religion (New York, 1934), pp. 77-78, states: "The theory of the human intelligence is the essential doctrine of Thomism and is the keynote of the Christian Aristotelian thesis. Hitherto both the Averroist and the Christian Platonist had regarded the spiritual principle of intelligence as something super- human and divine. It was not in man as part of his personality; it was a power which illuminated his mind from the outside, whether it is regarded with the Christian Platonists as the ray of Divine Light which illuminates the immortal soul, or whether, as Averroes taught, it was the power of universal intelligence actuating the successive, transitory and mortal minds of men. For St. Thomas, on the other hand, the active intelligence is the very essence of the soul and the root of human responsibility and liberty. 'For if,' he writes, 'the active intelli- gence is a substance outside man, the whole of man's activity depends on an extrinsic principle. Man then will not be a free agent but will be acted upon by another, and so he will not be the master of his own acts nor deserve praise or blame; and the whole of moral science and of social science will perish . . ." Recent scholarship indicates that Milton's theology is at once more complex and more indeterminate than that found in the main stream of Calvinist ortho- doxy. On the matter of divine illumination, however, Milton follows the late Augustinian and Christian Platonist concepts, though he rejects some of their pessimistic implications. For Milton as for Calvin "natural" reason is not impressive. The actual basis for this view is the evaluation of man in terms of original sin. The origin of the late Augustinian, Lutheran, and Calvinist views is to be found in the unsettled relations between two main Christian traditions in the Middle Ages. The one tradition derives from St. Augustine, who regards all Christian wisdom, whether gained through reason or revelation, as one. No attempt is made by him to dif- ferentiate clearly the realms of reason and of faith. Man's nature for St. Augus- tine means everything that man is-essentially and substantially. If what is is altered by the Fall, nature is altered, and we find St. Augustine using phrases like "the corruption of nature." The whole man, his full nature for St. Augustine, before the Fall was everything man was, including all the graces that God freely gave him. Since the Fall resulted in the loss of grace, what man is, after the Fall, is therefore a changed, a damaged, nature. For St. Thomas, on the other hand, there is a world of stable, unchangeable essences. The nature of man is for St. Thomas what man is essentially. This na- ture cannot be changed without the production of a new being. In other words, any change of nature means a change in what makes man man. The nature of man is for St. Thomas, therefore, the same after the Fall as before. St. Augustine wrote rather rhetorically and used words like "essence" and "nature" in a loosely defined and nontechnical sense. For St. Thomas philosophy was the science of reason, involving a strictly defined and highly technical vocabu- lary. If the definitions of these key words, as they are used in St. Thomas, are read into the writings of St. Augustine or St. Paul, the result must be a view of nature and of man similar to that held by Luther or Calvin. If, when we read in St. Augustine that the nature of man is damaged (that is, changed for the worse) by the Fall, we give the word "nature" the meaning it has for St. Thomas, we must conclude that the essence of man has been altered. Commentators on St. Augustine did apply the semantics of St. Thomas in this way. In this light, "na- tural" man could not be highly esteemed. Whatever the semantic confusions, the ultimate effect is a tradition of theo- 177</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE and, accordingly, Milton's God seems to have passed from Scriptural history into a work of creative imagination. II Both Dante and Milton attempted a comprehensive picture of the universe and of the relationship between Creator and created according to their respective cultural and theological traditions. The Divine Comedy and Paradise Lost have colored two respective social and po- litical traditions. They cover a great deal of mutual ground, and such is the flux of modern thought that Milton's work, viewed in retrospect from our prevailing culture, seems much more to approach Dante in orthodoxy rather than to depart from him. Milton is emphasized more in the role of humanist and of Christian than as a radical Protestant who was not even consistently orthodox with respect to the seven- teenth-century Puritan body.9 Though polarities of interpretation continue to exist regarding the orthodox element in Paradise Lost (for example, Lewis and Bush, on the one hand-Belloc and Saurat, on the other), it is important to restate the orthodox ground on which Milton stands and which he shares in common with Dante. Both believe in God and in the demon- strable justice of God. Both believe that God has transcendent and immanent aspects. Both, attempting to penetrate the meaning of evil, accept the experience of evil as an objective fact in the created world. Both believe in free will, although their theological and philosophical approaches to this subject differ considerably. Both believe that the world of present existence offers a decisive cosmic struggle upon which the salvation of man depends. Not every critic would be disposed to grant so wide a common area. Arthur 0. Lovejoy in his invaluable book (more especially for the questions it raises rather than for its answers), The Great Chain of Being (Cambridge, Mass., 1942), believes that Milton is inconsistent in the Treatise of Christian Doctrine in deciding whether God is bound by necessity insofar as He always acts right. According to Lovejoy, logical pessimism. St. Augustine himself frequently expresses what Etienne Gilson calls "the eulogy of fallen nature." He thinks of man in terms of loss of grace, but he does not subscribe to intrinsic corruption. Late Augustinian tradi- tion, however, viewing man as intrinsically corrupt, makes man completely de- pendent on grace and illumination. Actually Milton rebels against the extreme pessimism of this thesis. As Sewell points out, "regeneration is possible, to those who know nothing of Christ, whether they be Jews or Gentiles" (op. cit., p. 188). 9 Thus Douglas Bush in The Renaissance and English Htumanism (Toronto, 1939), p. 110, states: "He belongs to that great tradition which stretches back through Spenser and Dante to the writers of Greece and Rome, the tradition of the poet who is an active citizen and a leader of his age." Bush particularly dis- pels the nineteenth-century view of Milton that was influenced by romanticism, and makes an excellent apology for Milton as a humanist. 178</page><page sequence="7">PARADISE LOST AND THE DIVINE COMEDY Milton's ultimate position emphasizes divine self-sufficiency to such an extent that the Deity's exercise of his creative power seems motiveless. "His 'goodness was free to act or not.' "10 Such points, however, when applied to Paradise Lost itself are somewhat out of focus and merely imply that Milton is not an exact theologian and did not always ap- preciate the finesse of the problem that he rationalizes. A more considerable area of difference between the two poets arises from the fact that, in some ways, Milton attempted a more difficult task than Dante. Dante viewed the cosmic universe and its problems retrospectively from a vantage point that is simultaneously that of a chronicler and of a traveler. Dante is reporting something that has been done, whereas Milton is in the position of the narrator who has to tell us of what is to be. Milton looks at the creation from the view- point of anterior time. Milton has to explain and motivate the fall of the angels; he foresees the history of man as something taking place in the future as a result of the original Satanic temptation. Dante begins from a posterior vantage point and thus avoids the difficulty entailed in presenting the fall of the angels and the problem of original sin. For Dante, the orthodox order is already established, and his consequent emphasis is upon a cosmic struggle from the viewpoint of one human being (Dante himself) in a definite, emphatically concrete setting. Dante's point of departure for his epic is a well-known historical world. Milton, on the other hand, presents a world of vast spaces, of un- determined chaos, a cosmos largely unpeopled and in a state of comparative flux. Milton's theme is civil war; and not only the angels, but Milton's God Himself, tend to indulge in long discourses regard- ing freedom and justification.11 Dante, on the other hand, starts with a specific Hell in which specific human beings are categorized according to their crimes, not only in the light of Dante's humanistic studies, but 10 Lovejoy, op cit., p. 160. Lovejoy is preoccupied throughout the work by the apparent contradiction between the idea of God, conceived as self-sufficient tran- scendence, and the idea of God, conceived as the plenitude of goodness. In Chris- tian thought, the mystery of the Incarnation bridges this gap; but the under- standing of these relationships is not so easily to be secured by a rationalistic approach as by mystical experience (too little value is placed in our intellectual investigations on what Christian mysticism and the mystical way has to teach us). Lovejoy refers to Paradise Lost, VII, 171-172; VIII, 415f., 427ff. From these passages he infers that "there appeared to be in the nature of things not only no reason why any world of imperfect creatures should exist, but every reason why it should not exist ... a self-absorbed and unproductive God would not be less, but, if possible more divine, and that there is no necessity and, indeed, no reason for the existence of any creature." It is quite possible that Milton, as Lovejoy himself suggests, in his insistence on avoiding determinism, may fall into a careless and excessive conception of free will. But it is important to emphasize Milton's antagonism in this respect to the prevailing dogma of Calvin- ism. Bush, op. cit., p. 114, states, "when we survey Milton's whole body of writ- ing in prose and verse, we see that his various ideas and principles start from a passionate belief in the freedom of the will." 11 Cf. Paradise Lost, II, 557ff.; III, 185ff., 290ff.; VI, 175ff. 179</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE in terms of Dante's direct experience and knowledge of contemporary men. It would not be quite accurate to say that one of the main contrasts between Milton and Dante is that of abstractness, on the one hand, and of concreteness, on the other-of the universal, in Milton's case, gradually manifesting itself in the particular, and of the particular, in Dante's case, reaching carefully through stages to the symbol of uni- versality. But there is a rough exactitude in this statement. Milton, of course, has his points of concreteness, and Dante, working more gingerly in the light of his knowledge of philosophy and theology, ex- presses the universal. It is also roughly true to say that these differences have their analogies in the respectively Catholic and Protestant view- points of the two poets. Protestantism, stemming from the late Augus- tinian, Lutheran, and Calvinist traditions and, in a certain sense, from original Neoplatonic and Platonic sources, tends to overemphasize (at least from the Thomistic viewpoint) the universal value and to mini- mize the individuated and concrete object. The word "spiritual," loosely used, has come to imply certain values of philosophical idealism, of late Augustinian "illuminism," and is, there- fore, sometimes associated with an antimaterial bias. In this usage of the word (sometimes also associated with an exaggerated statement of the Pauline position regarding flesh and spirit), the approach of Milton might be called more "spiritual" than that of Dante. Dante is nearer than Milton to the Thomistic emphasis on the individuated as well as the universal, on the body as well as the soul. Dante's type of concreteness has not escaped the suspicion of vulgarity from the view- point of Protestant tradition. The doctrines of the Real Presence, of sacramentalism generally, the dogma of Hell, veneration for relics- these are elements involving a close connection with the material that usually cause the most embarrassment for an educated Protestant at- tempting to see Catholicism objectively.12 Milton does not have any concrete Hell in the sense that Dante presents it to us.13 Milton's Hell is a chiaroscuro place of indefinite dimensions and amorphous shapes, in which the leading devils can form strategic plans and evaluate their metaphysical position. It is not a place where concrete individuals known to Milton are punished for concrete transgressions. Another area in which the two poets diverge most significantly is in their aesthetic approaches to the concept of God. Milton does not hesitate to portray the Creator directly as a person, and, in so doing, 12 C. S. Lewis in his Preface to Paradise Lost does not agree with Saurat (Milton: Man and Thinker) that Milton subscribes in his epic to the principle that matter is uncreated and eternal. Milton, in his belief that at death the whole man dies, departs from orthodoxy, but, in his insistence that the body is not a mere container of the soul, he is nearer to the Thomistic than to the Calvinist tradition. 13 Paradise Lost, IV, 76. "Which way I fly is Hell: myself am Hell ..." 180</page><page sequence="9">PARADISE LOST AND THE DIVINE COMEDY he becomes much more anthropomorphic in his references to the Crea- tor than Dante. His difficulty is the greater in that he emphasizes God the Father; and, in the presentation of God the Father, Milton, lack- ing sufficient Scriptural resources, cannot merely speak with the voice of history-he is obliged to proceed in the manner of a speculative theologian and an apologist. Hie is also driven by his particular aesthetic method, by the way in which he knits together his epic, to emphasize a debate and a conflict between God and an adversary. In the main- tenance of such a conflict, the adversary may easily be built up beyond his proper philosophical and theological dimensions. Probably realiz- ing the intellectual dangers into which he was running by creating the type of conflict that makes for an interesting story but not for theologi- cal accuracy, Milton often indirectly or directly reproaches the fallen angels for their attempt to defeat the impossible.14 Though Milton never in theory or principle approaches the Manichaean position of considering good and evil as opposed positive forces locked in eternal struggle, yet, in the actual telling of his story, in order to create the suspense of a conflict in an imaginative and aesthetic sense, Milton's God seems at times merely to be a stronger principle than his opponent, not a distinctly different being on an altogether different level. The fact that Milton's God argues so frequently does not suggest in Him an amplitude of power worthy of an omnipotent creator. Dante's artistic method was eminently more successful in avoiding such theological pitfalls. Dante's aesthetic method is more consistent with man's state of limited knowledge. Quite deliberately Dante keeps a real and reverent distance from mystery, whereas Milton tends toward a somewhat presumptuous rationalism when he attempts to explain too much. Dante, by referring to God only under terms of careful symbolism, and, particularly, by a very graduated approach to mystery through the agency of such characters as Beatrice, St. Thomas Aquinas, and St. Bernard, avoids placing himself in such a false posi- tion. The value of symbolism, in contrast to rationalistic explanation, in dealing with theological mystery is abundantly proved in Dante's work. A symbol points to truth, is representative of truth, but it in no way attempts an exposition or justification of truth. Throughout the Divine Comedy we have a very vivid sense of the love and intelligence of the Creator touching all aspects of his creation; but His presence is artistically presented in terms of reflection, with frequent use of the mirror itself as a metaphor. 15 The more beautiful, the more intelligent, 14 Paradise Lost, II, 557; IV, 60ff. 15 Cf. Paradise, Canto XXVIII. Dante succeeds in giving the reader a sense of joy in regard to the Creator, a sense not sufficiently present in Milton. Here again aesthetic method is involved. Milton associates majesty and glory with the Deity, but joy is more specifically stressed in the Garden of Eden where God is not immediately present, whereas Dante's poem reaches an emotional climax in the Beatific Vision. 181</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE and the more loving the various characters are, the nearer seems their ascent to the Creator. But Dante always veils the Creator Himself in mystery. By this aesthetic method he skillfully avoids the anthropomor- phism which, for the orthodox reader, must at times reduce the majesty of Milton's poem. III Involved with these different aesthetic methods is another area of difference between these two poems that touches the very subject of mystery. Dante adheres to the mediaeval viewpoint that, while reason is the natural instrument man must use in most instances to arrive at truth, reason in itself cannot penetrate everything; there is the world of mystery, too, an intelligible mystery that is consistent with reason but which we cannot hope, merely through the passage of time or through the power of thought only, to penetrate. Milton does not have this peculiar respect for mystery. Milton is neither shy nor reluctant to explain the Creator (with the view, of course, of justifying Him). Milton does not doubt but that the muse of heavenly grace will in- spire him to reach the height of his great argument. But, in his em- phasis on justification-which also implies rationalistic demonstration -he seems to expect that grace will be entirely contained by reason. He overlooks the possibility that grace does not always argue. Dante, on the other hand, even when he obtains a glimpse of the Beatific Vision, sees that vision in terms of eternal light, dwelling only within itself and "sole understood." He tells of the Beatific Vision in terms of mathematics, only to emphasize the shortcomings of the intellect in the face of mystery. There are flights beyond Dante's wing, though a flash penetrates his mind, the type of intuition frequently connected with the mystical experience. But Dante does not attempt to convey mystical experience-he merely indicates what was understood in mediaeval theology and philosophy in terms of the will rolling onward "by the love impelled that moves the sun in heaven and all the stars." In Milton, on the other hand, God is directly presented. Milton's God the Father may be considered as a stage director within the cosmic drama. We see Milton's God as an active agent, and his activities may be viewed in the light of a strategic chess game in which the victory is assured and one-sided. In reading Milton one looks at the cosmic uni- verse from the point of view of the power that affects it, not, as in Dante, from the point of view of those who are affected. Once again it would seem that Dante has chosen the easier and more human approach to the cosmic theme. Milton's choice was the more difficult; and in his lack of veneration for mystery, and in his aesthetic method, he fell into the dangers of rationalism and anthropo- morphism. 182</page><page sequence="11">PARADISE LOST AND THE DIVINE COMEDY IV One of the major contrasts in the two poets lies in their presenta- tion of evil. Dante, in dramatizing evil in the Divine Comedy, presents an evil that is under control, that has its static place of confinement, that is itself under obedience.'6 Milton, on the other hand, attempts to present the dimensions of a conflict anterior to the Fall of Man- and the evil is still fluid and unspecified in its effects. Milton, in Paradise Lost, is involved in two problems-that of free- dom and that of justice. On the main points of both these problems he seems to be basically orthodox. A certain misunderstanding of his pre- sentation of both problems arises from overlooking the strongly dra- matic tradition which enters Paradise Lost. Comus and Samson Agon- istes are written in dramatic form, and Milton, deeply influenced by Elizabethan tradition, has a scarcely less strong inclination toward this form in the epic. It is to the credit of a dramatist to present a character with strict reference to the character himself and not to the personal evaluations of the dramatist. Obviously in Paradise Lost the view- points and expositions of Satan cannot be taken at their face value. By the same criterion, the thesis of Milton's conscious or unconscious sympathy with Satan must be held suspect. It might be argued in a similar way that Shakespeare is sympathetic toward Macbeth; but sympathy, in this sense, the penetration of the author into the mind of a character, is quite a different thing from moral and intellectual ap- proval. To understand in this sense is not necessarily to forgive. Satan is intensely dramatic-and in dramatic sense Milton is distinctly su- perior to Dante, although it is also true to say that Dante's allegorical method was not meant to be, and need not be, dramatic. Satan wins our sympathy in the same sense that any tragic character, of whose morality we do not approve, may win our sympathy; but this aesthetic sympathy in no way blinds the careful reader to the real- ization that Satan consistently deceives theologically. The rather ob- noxiously complacent and tyrannical picture of the Deity that Satan draws is, of course, part of his strategy of deceit. Actually Milton follows the mediaeval hierarchic concept no less than Dante. Milton believes that there is a natural hierarchy of being in which the superior should exercise authority over the inferior ac- cording to criteria that make for the freedom and welfare of all. To 16 Dante is remarkable in locating evil in its true causes. No one has inveighed against corruption in the existential Church more than he; no one has pointed out more concretely sin and evil. But Dante, as an artist and a Christian human- ist, gives so inclusive an understanding of his values that the reader aesthetically realizes that the evil portrayed is a concrete deviation from truths permanent and triumphant. Dante's sense of glory and of joy enables him to assimilate the presentation of evil. 183</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE attempt to destroy such a hierarchy is not to achieve freedom but to deny the facts of both temporal and supernatural life. This is the point of Abdiel's speech in Book V of Paradise Lost. For Abdiel there is no loss of liberty in obeying a power that is de jure and de facto established, a power that is at the same time good and provident: . .shalt thou dispute With Him the points of liberty, who made Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being? Yet, by experience taught, we know how good, And of our good and of our dignity How provident he is ... (V, 822-828) In Book VI Abdiel takes up the argument again and finds that free- dom lies in the observance of rightful authority. To attempt to evade this rightful authority is to create a new kind of tyranny, the tyranny of self which replaces the freedom of a true objective order. Milton would provide cold comfort for the romantics: Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains, Or nature. God and nature bid the same, When he who rules is worthiest, and excels Them whom he governs. This is servitude, To serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled Against his worthier, as thine now serves thee, Thyself not free, but to thyself inthralled ... (VI, 174-181) To observe this hierarchy is simple justice, and justice is freedom. Whatever may be the shortcomings of Milton as an intellectual, one great intuition and one great proposition rings through all his works- that "virtue alone is free." Milton rejects the Calvinist concept of predestination and the philo- sophical necessity implicit in it. In following the doctrines of Arminius on grace, he tends to recover the original orthodox position; for on this particular subject Arminius represents a reaction toward orthodoxy in the face of contemporary Calvinism.17 Milton departs from Calvin in stating that God calls others to salvation beside the elect: The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warned Their sinful state, and to appease betimes The incensed Deity, while offered grace Invites ... (III, 185-188) 17 Cf. J. H. Hanford, A Milton Handbook (New York, 1946), p. 229. Father M. C. D'Arcy, S. J., presents an interesting thesis, stressing the distinction be- tween animus and anima in relation to the Fall and to grace, in The Mind and 184</page><page sequence="13">PARADISE LOST AND THE DIVINE COMEDY To these the Deity will give sufficient grace and within them is placed the umpire, conscience. The degree of Lutheran doctrine present in the Paradise Lost is difficult to ascertain. God the Father, in speaking to the Son, says: ... Thy merit, Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, And live in thee transplanted, and from thee Receive new life. (III, 290-295) This statement could be narrowly interpreted to imply the Lutheran doctrine of imputed righteousness; but, on the other hand, all Christ- ians would agree that virtue is universal and free and does not consti- tute a personal possession. A Christian in a certain sense must give up his righteousness, and thus acquire a detachment from his own per- fectibility, and even perfection. V Milton thought long and earnestly (and to a degree, confusedly) on religious questions. He certainly is not a representative Puritan- though it also should be emphasized that the Puritan movement was not a homogeneous and well-disciplined movement but rather con- tained within itself the seed of many differences. Implicit at the very beginning of the Puritan movement is that dilemma which is always attached to religious determinism--the dilemma between the assump- tion that religion should attempt to change things and the assumption that nothing can really be changed. Strict adherence to Calvinist dogma meant that certain souls were written in the Book of Life, and that all those omitted from this cosmic list were consigned to eternal dam- nation. Unfortunately this theological position did not give any intel- lectual foundation for the work of the Puritan preacher. From a prac- tical viewpoint, the preacher's pulpit eloquence was largely wasted on those already destined for salvation, and, according to strict Calvinism, he could do nothing good for those already lost.18 What then, it might be asked, was his purpose? In unconsciously or consciously finding a suitable purpose, quite a few Puritan preachers moved in the direction Heart of Love (New York, 1947), p. 191. The Fall is interpreted in the sacrifice of anima, self-effacing love, to animus, egocentric love. "The point of the story of the Fall is that God had given to the first human beings an integrity such that the animus and the anina were in perfect accord . . .If we wish for an example of this accord in a great and sinless nature, we can take the biblical account of the Fall of Lucifer and the sin of Adam so majestically portrayed in Milton." 18 The most complete and authoritative book on historical Puritanism is that of William Haller, The Rise of Puritanism (New York, 1938). This work explains in detail the aspirations and dilemmas of the Puritan preachers. 185</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE of Arminianism and of Milton's position that others beside the elect could be saved. Milton shared in another confusion faced by Puritan thinkers. In one direction, he wished to enforce a godly concept of society, and, in common with a large number of Puritans, moved in the direction of a theocracy. In the literature of Puritanism there is a confusion between freedom in the sense of the freedom of the sons of God-the freedom of the true believer who has gone through the cycle of election, justifi- cation, and sanctification-and freedom in a nonreligious, specifically political sense.19 Politically, it was discovered (as mediaeval Lollardy would have shown) that it is impractical to restrict political rights to the elect or those who are in a state of grace. Cromwell, in organizing his army, dispensed with any requirements of sectarian rectitude. Actu- ally, of course, the state of a man's soul is not in the power of other men to determine with any accuracy. Strictly according to the Calvin- ists, the only man who is truly free is the man who belongs to the elect; but it was soon found impossible to define such a group within the political order. Milton is sufficiently discreet to think of man in the universal sense as more or less sharing in liberty, but he believed that such liberty should be modified or qualified by an elite both in the spiritual and intellectual sense. For the practical business of finding such leadership neither Milton nor Puritanism could offer a solution. Dante's solution was the medi- aeval one of honoring the office according to accepted law and tradi- tion, of praying for a good incumbent, bearing with-and hoping that vengeance would overtake--the unworthy incumbent.20 Milton in the Animadversions states that the Holy Bible contains every rule and instrument of knowledge, everything necessary for the life of man and for the duties of human society. He repeats in various ways and in various contexts his thesis that "that which is most necessary to be known is most easy" and that "the very essence of truth is plainness and brightness.21 Milton was probably too optimistic about man's fa- cility for seeking the truth without reference to institutional guidance, and overlooked, in common with Puritan society generally, the sub- jective and psychological element of error that stands between the observer's viewpoint and the objective truth that lies before him. Mil- 19 Haller states in The Rise of Puritanisn, p. 93, that "election-vocation-justi- fication-sanctification-glorification was more than an abstract formula. It became the pattern of the most profound experience of men through many generations." 20 Gerald G. Walsh, S. J., in Dante Alighieri, Citizen of Christendom (Mil- waukee, 1946), particularly stresses the social and political conscience of Dante in reference to mediaeval institutional life. Dante berates leaders who do not lead, not overlooking bishops and popes, but with the end in view that the institutions themselves may flourish more effectively. 21 Quoted from Of Reformation inr England in Frank Allen Patterson, The Student's Milton (New York, 1934), p. 452. 186</page><page sequence="15">PARADISE LOST AND THE DIVINE COMEDY ton failed, as did Puritanism generally, to guard against this subjec- tive element. In the political field, the difficulty became evident at once. The Puritans had either to modify their viewpoint or to realize that, by their arbitrary dismissal of the institutional aspects of church and state, they were moving toward anarchy.22 Institutions are recogniz- able by men, whereas the key to a pattern of natural hierarchic excel- lence is not readily available. VI In conclusion it may be said that Milton in Paradise Lost more closely abides by orthodox tradition than in any of his other work. But his aesthetic method encourages a departure from, rather than a support of, orthodox tradition. He veers from orthodoxy in following merely the surface pattern of theological history, while in reality he is creat- ing an imaginative work with an independence and an originality that Scripture does not warrant. Dante, on the other hand, starting with human experience, undertook no such responsibilty to history. Con- fusing, probably unintentionally, the Aristotelian forms of history and creative art, Milton moves dangerously in the direction of anthropo- morphism and of rationalism, particularly in view of his rashness in dealing with mystery. Aristotle argued that poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are of the nature rather of universals, whereas those of history are singu- lars.23 But Aristotle could not forsee the theological postulates of Christianity, wherein the facts of the Creation and the Incarnation comprise all possibilities-all that is, has been, and may be. These mys- teries are at once singular and universal. In dealing with them the artist cannot evade his responsibility to history without compromising orthodoxy. The conclusion seems inescapable that Dante's method, which does not deal primarily with Scriptural history, but which is basically one of symbolism, permits that truth which is veiled in mys- tery to be indicated without exposition or presumption, and is, there- fore, the method best adapted to a penetration of the inclusive truth of religion.
