LXXXIV November-December, 1950 No. 819 MENDELIAN POPULATIONS AND THEIR EVOLUTION' THEODOSIUS DOBZHANSKY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK THE best view of a mountain range is usually obtained from a distance; at close quarters minor peaks, and even hills, obstruct the vista of the whole range. To understand man and his universe is the goal of the scientific move- ment; this goal must always be kept in view, in order that we do not mistake means for the end. Well-authenticated facts are the life blood of science, and gathering them will always remain the principal function of scientific research. But science is more than a mass of facts; it is a meaningful system of significant facts. Facts taken out of their con- text, showy methods to solve meaningless problems, and learned terminologies for conceptual trivialities are often amusing to play with, but they stultify the work of a sci- entist. Integration of the results obtained by individual scientists and by various disciplines is therefore an impor- tant function which should be performed. The stones should be fitted to form an intelligible mosaic. The general view of the world unfolded by science should be kept before our eyes in order that scientific work be directed purpose- fully and effectively. Now, experience has shown that, at least in biology, generalization and integration can best be made by scientists who are also fact-gatherers, rather than by sneeilist in hioloyicnl smeculation The chief aim of 1 Address of the President of the American Society of Naturalists, read at Columbus, Ohio, on September 13, 1950.

Because it ties together the greatest number of most diverse facts into a simple and meaningful system, the theory of organic evolution is by far the most significant generalization which has yet emerged from the biological sciences. In the light of this theory, living beings are no longer considered as products of fortuitous accidents, or the caprice of some deity. The living world as we see it today is the outcome of a long historical development enacted during approximately one billion years of earth's existence, and still continuing to occur before our eyes. Furthermore, the causes of this evolutionary develop- mnent happen to appeal to our reasoning faculties. They seem to us to make sense. Darwin was the first to suppose, and his view has been borne out by the subsequent develop- ments of the evolutionary thought, that organisms exhibit evolutionary changes because they become adapted, through natural selection, to live in different environments. The existence of environments unoccupied by life, or of ineffi- ciently exploited ecological niches, constitutes a challenge to which the protoplasm may respond by evolutionary in- ventions of new kinds of organisms adapted to the demands of these environments. The alga Sphaerella nivalis, which lives on patches of permanent snow in high mountains, or Phormnidium bijahense and Oscillaria filiformis, which occur in the hot springs of Yellowstone at 850 C. (Copeland, 1936), are among the more spectacular responses to appar- ently impossibly difficult challenges. But organic diversity as a whole must also be regarded as an answer of living matter to the diversity of environments which exist in the world. Darwin's theory of natural selection has pointed the way to explanation of adaptive evolutionary changes. But a causal analysis of such changes became possible only in our day, because of the great discovery made by Mendel some 85 years ago, to the rediscovery of Mendel's work 50 years ago, and to the subsequent development of Mendel's prin-</page><page sequence="3">No. 819] MENDELIAN POPULATIONS 403 ciples. This causal analysis is still far from complete; even so, it represents one of the signal achievements of biology during the first half of the twentieth century. Darwin pointed out that differential survival of the better-adapted variants, and elimination of the less well- adapted ones, should lead to a gradual rise of the level of adaptedness of species in which such differential reproduc- tion takes place. But Darwin realized that the process which he postulated can occur only in species which possess a supply of heritable variations in fitness to survive in existing environments. He concluded, quite correctly as we know, that most existing species do possess such a supply. But he realized that the origins of this supply had to be elucidated by further work. Mendel's discovery supplied the key to such elucidation. Hardy and Weinberg in 1908 used it to open the first lock. Investigation of the muta- tion process in Drosophila by Morgan and his followers created a solid base for further advance. The next step was taken by Chetverikov in 1926. His paper was published only in Russian, and it remained unknown to Fisher (1930) and to Wright (1931), who, together with Chetverikov, may be considered founders of the modern analysis of evo- lutionary phenomena. The pre-Mendelian view, which was of necessity accepted by Darwin, was that the heredity of the offspring is a blend, a fusion product, of the heredities of the parents. If this were correct, sexual reproduction would devour and con- sume the heritable variation present in panmictic popula- tions at a prodigious rate, namely, it would reduce the genotypic variance by one-half in every generation. At this pace of expenditure, a population would soon come to consist of genotypically uniform individuals. It would be- come a pure race, in which selection would cease to operate, unless, of course, genotypic variance were to arise anew at a rate at least comparable to its destruction. It is perhaps fortunate that Darwin did not make the calculations which would have revealed to him this most serious of objections against his theory. For the difficulty</page><page sequence="4">404 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [Vol. LXXXIV is now known to be spurious, because of Mendel's demon- stration that the heredity transmitted from parents to off- spring is an aggregate of genes, which do not blend but which segregate. The importance of this fact for evolution is immense. Sexual reproduction does not erode and level off, but on the contrary conserves, hereditary variability. Every sexual species accordingly possesses a gene pool, in which each gene may be represented by a certain number of alleles, and each chromosome by one or more structural variants. The frequencies of each allele and each chromo- some variant in the gene pool remain constant from genera- tion to generation, unless mutation, selection, or genetic drift intervene to alter them. The classic way to study a species, or a part of it, is to determine the modes or averages for as many traits as possible, in as large a sample of its representatives as prac- ticable. The resulting system of averages is taken to be a common property of the species as a whole, and is believed, at least by implication, to characterize the ideal species type. This conception of species type was logical so long as the heredity of the offspring was supposed to be an alloy of the heredities of the parents. The species type would then have been the limiting condition towards which the species would gravitate owing to sexual reproduction. But with gene heredity, a system of character averages has no real meaning, in the sense that it is not a property of any spatio- temporal object. Such a system of averages is a statistical fiction which, to be sure, may be very useful for purposes of description and cataloguing. Building a convenient catalogue of organisms is one of the tasks of biological systemnatics. On the other hand, a biologically realistic description of a species or a race should, theoretically, indi- cate the frequencies in its gene pool of gene alleles and chromosomal variants. At the present state of knowledge, such descriptions are admittedly too difficult to make to be useful in practical systematics. It must, however, be estab- lished as a principle that, in living things, diversity and variability are more fundamental than types and averages.</page><page sequence="5">No. 819] MIENDELIAN POPULATIONS 405 It is a habit of thought fostered by the exigencies of cata- logue making, to regard individuals of a species as more or less perfect incarnations of a species ideal. This habit stems ultimately from Platonic philosophy and from scholastic theology. It conflicts with Mendel's findings, is basically anti-evolutionist, and is responsible for much confusion in biological thinking. Species and races of practical systematics are categories of man-made classification. But it happens to be conveni- ent to delimit species and races in such a way that they usually coincide with certain spatio-temporal entities, which are integrated systems of genotypes bound together by having access to common gene pools. It is important, then, to distinguish between systematic categories, set up for practical purposes of catalogue making, and the underlying spatio-temporal entities. These latter may be referred to as Mendelian populations. A Mendelian population is a reproductive community of sexual and cross-fertilizing indi- viduals which share in a common gene pool. The apprehension of Mendelian populations is made diffi- cult by the compound nature of many of them. The bio- logical species is the largest and most inclusive Mendelian population. Supraspecific groupings, such as subgenera, genera, etc., do not possess common gene pools, and conse- quently do not have the biological reality of Mendelian populations. But species are differentiated into complexes of subordinate Mendelian populations, which may be re- ferred to as subspecies, races, or local populations. Each of these subordinate gene pools may, like the gene pool of the species, be uniquely characterized in terms of frequencies of gene alleles and chromosome variants. The smallest Mendelian populations are panmictic units (Wright, 1943), which are groups of individuals any two of which have equal probability of mating and producing offspring (pro- vided, of course, that they are of opposite sex and are sexu- ally mature). Panmictic units are integrated into more or less complex systems of Mendelian populations, which cul- minate in species.</page><page sequence="6">406 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [Vol. LXXXIV Mendelian populations can be recognized as separate entities even if they are quite similar genetically. Geneti- cally similar Mendelian populations may have separate gene pools because these populations are isolated from one another on different islands or by other means. By con- trast, a systematist recognizes the existence of two or more taxonomic groups only if he finds genetic difference between them. The first question asked about taxonomic groups is: What traits are common to individuals within a group but differ in individuals of different groups? The first question asked about a Mendelian population is: What is its breed- ing structure? The distinction between Mendelian populations and taxonomic groups can be illustrated even more vividly by (considering the situation in organisms which reproduce asexually, by parthenogenesis, or by self-fertilization. If these methods of reproduction are not facultative (as they often are), but are established to the exclusion of cross- fertilization, the organisms concerned can not form Men- delian populations in the above-defined sense. For exam- ple, a clone of bacteria in which no sexual fusions occur is not a reproductive community and has no common gene pool. Individuals of a clone are genotypically alike, barring mutation; yet, a clone has no biological unity, except retro- spectively by virtue of common descent from a single indi- vidual. By contrast, members of a Mendelian population have a continuous biological bond, because of the occur- rence of matings in the reproductive community. Con- sidered biologically, such a species as Homo sapiens or species of Drosophila flies or of birds are quite different phenomena from the clusters of clones which are referred to as " species " in bacteria, fungi imperfecti, or in obliga- tory apogamic plants. Nevertheless, systematists find it convenient to use the same taxonomic categories and the same descriptive techniques for all organisms. By far the most complex system of Mendelian popula- tions exists in the human species. Because of this com- plexity, anthropologists and geneticists are only beginning</page><page sequence="7">No. 819] MENDELIAN POPULATIONS 407 to learn how to disentangle and study these populations, or isolates, as they are often referred to in man. Like many other biological species, man is geographically polytypic, i.e., composed of major and minor geographic populations, or races, which differ in frequencies of many genes. But in addition to the geographic races, man has evolved national, linguistic, religious, economic, and other cultural isolates. Furthermore, human isolates do not form hierarchies of inclusive and subordinate isolates, as animal and plant populations usually do. For example, economic isolates may cut across linguistic boundaries, and religious isolates may overlap geographic ones. The lack of a clear idea of what constitutes a Mendelian population, or a race, has caused a great deal of confusion in anthropology. For ex- ample, people with blue eyes, or with round or with oblong heads, or with heads shaped like some prehistoric skull, or fat people, or people convicted for crime, or sufferers from cancer or other diseases do not form Mendelian popula- tions. It is meaningless to call such collections of indi- viduals races, as they have sometimes been called. Another difficulty in the study of Mendelian populations arises from the fact that they are not fixed and static, but are dynamic entities which undergo evolutionary changes. A Mendelian population may split in the course of time into two or more derived ones; conversely, once distinct populations may fuse into one. Excellent examples of genesis, divergence, convergence, and fusion of Mendelian populations can be observed in the human species. Thus, the fluidity of social isolates is quite apparent, and develop- ment of culture has led to gene exchange between geo- graphic races. Considered biologically, the rise of tribes, nations, and castes leads to the appearance of new gene pools. Wars, migrations, and social upheavals lead usually to the breakdown of barriers between existing gene pools. A fascinating and yet almost untouched problem is to con- sider and to evaluate social forces from the standpoint of their evolutionary significance. Now, the differentiation and fusion of Mendelian popu-</page><page sequence="8">408 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [Vol. LXXXIV nations takes place gradually and continuously. Only in exceptional cases, such as the formation of polyploids, can a new reproductively isolated population become estab- lished within a generation. Situations are, therefore, quite common in all sorts of organisms in which the boundaries between populations are not sharp or are barely indicated. This unavoidably leads to a certain degree of arbitrariness in the delimitation of populations, and of races and species to which they correspond. Hence, the disagreements among authorities as to how many races a certain species consists of, or whether certain populations should or should not be considered distinct species. The operational difficulties encountered in the delimita- tion of races, species, and other Mendelian populations are, thus, an inevitable result of the continuity of the evolu- tionary process. These difficulties have, however, led many biologists to the view that the only objective units in biol- ogy are individuals, while all supraindividual complexes are descriptive devices created by the investigator for his own ends. The antithesis to this attitude, which may, I think, be properly labelled defeatist, is the contention that com- plexes of individuals often reach levels of integration so advanced that they become " supraorganisms." The idea of supraorganism has been very ably developed, for exam- ple, in the recent book of Allee, Emerson, Park, Park, and Schmidt (1949). These authors are inclined to regard not only colonies of social insects and various intraspecific aggregations, but also biotic communities consisting of many species, as supraorganisms. The validity and usefulness of the concept of supra- organism will probably depend on the implications which the term is made to carry. But it must be admitted that one of the striking facts disclosed by modern ecology is that individuals are rarely, if ever, independent of other living individuals; they are nearly always members of more or less highly integrated systems. From the evolutionary stand- point, the individual can not be considered apart from the Mendelian population of which he is a member. Men-</page><page sequence="9">No. 819] MENDELIAN POPULATIONS 409 delian populations are the most fundamental of the inte- grational forms which such systems take among sexually reproducing organisms. The integrative agent is in this instance the process of reproduction itself. The funda- mental nature of this cohesive force needs no emphasis, although it is a matter of opinion whether the reproductive bond in a Mendelian population can profitably be likened to the organismic integration of cells and tissues in an indi- vidual. However that may be, Mendelian populations are spatio-temporal entities. It is interesting that Mendel's discovery implicitly reaffirmed the reality of both indi- viduals and populations in sexually reproducing organisms. An individual is not a reflection of an ideal species type, because every individual possesses a unique genotype; in sexual species with many unfixed genes the probability of two or more individuals having by chance the same combi- nation of genes is remote. On the other hand, the sexual unions and the gene segregations which occur in every generation condition both the continuity and the change- ability of the gene pool of a Mendelian population. It is less evident, and therefore worth greater emphasis, that Mendelian populations are, to an even greater extent than individuals, units of natural selection, and therefore of adaptation and of evolutionary change. Elimination of ill-adapted individuals within a population, exemplified by the destruction of deleterious mutants, is only one of the many forms of natural selection, and this particular form, as pointed out especially by Schmalhausen (1949), is largely a conservative rather than a creative agent. On the other hand, differential reproduction of populations appears to be very important in adaptive evolution. Most inter- esting for the present discussion are selective processes in populations with balanced polymorphism. Populations of many species of Drosophila are mixtures of chromosomal variants differing in the gene arrangement of certain chro- mosomes. Flies with different gene arrangements inter- breed freely, so that individuals are formed having two chromosomes of a pair with similar and with different gene</page><page sequence="10">410 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [Vol. LXXXIV arrangements (structural homozygotes and heterozygotes). Now, the heterozygotes are, with few exceptions, adap- tively superior to the corresponding homozygotes. Adap- tively inferior homozygotes are nevertheless produced in natural populations in every generation. Poorly adapted genotypes are, consequently, normal components of the species. This seemingly strange situation is, however, ex- plained very simply. If two gene alleles, or chromosomal variants, A' and A2, form a heterozygote, A'A2, which is adaptively superior to both homozygotes, A'A' and A2A2, natural selection will tend to establish an equilibrium state, at which both A' and A2 will be present with certain defi- nite frequencies. The crux of the matter is that the average fitness of an individual in the population will be greatest when A' and A2 reach equilibrium frequencies. In other words, natural selection enhances the adaptedness of the Mendelian population as a whole, at the price of continu- ous production of some less well-adapted individuals. The study of Drosophila populations has disclosed not only that balanced polymorphism is a very common phe- nomenon in that genus but that the intensity of the selec- tive processes involved is greater than most geneticists suspected might be the case in natural populations. How widely similar phenomena are spread in organisms other than Drosophila is for the time being an open question. Crow (1948), Dobzhansky (1950), and Brieger (1950) have inferred that heterosis in maize must be due to a kind of balanced polymorphism, and it is possible that this is also the case in other sexually reproducing species which have large effective breeding populations. It would be unprofit- able at present to speculate as to the extent to which reces- sive hereditary diseases and genotypic inferiorities that plague human populations may represent the genetic chaff unavoidable in the production of highly fit heterozygous types. But, assuredly, this possibility must be kept in mind in studies on the genetics of human populations. The relationships between the adaptedness of individuals and of populations are evidently complex. It is just as</page><page sequence="11">No. 819] MENDELIAN POPULATIONS 411 platitudinous to assert that the welfare of a population depends upon that of its members as it is to say that the health of the body is determined by the soundness of its parts. Life has evolved a hierarchy of integrative levels: genes, chromosomes, cells, individuals, several orders of Mendelian populations, and of biotic communities. The existence of all levels is based ultimately on some patterns of physico-chemical reactions, as yet unknown, which result in the self-reproduction of certain molecules, or molecular aggregates, called genes. Self-reproduction is accordingly the basic phenomenon of life, because its consequence is the process of natural selection, and hence of evolution. In turn, natural selection increases the efficiency of self-repro- duction and develops a diversity of self-reproducing entities capable of functioning in a variety of environments. The structure of genes and of all products of their inte- gration is an outcome of a long evolutionary development controlled by natural selection. Moreover, and this is fundamental, the different methods of integration are themselves a result of adaptive evolution. This is fairly generally recognized for levels up to and including the individual; for example, the formation of multicellular organisms from colonies of only loosely associated cells is clearly an adaptive step. But the same principle applies with equal force to supraindividual levels, namely, to Men- delian populations and biotic communities. Mendelian populations owe their existence to sexual reproduction. Darwin and Weismann realized that sex is an evolutionary adaptation, but the situation could not be understood except on the basis of Mendel's discovery. It remained for Wright, Muller, Darlington, and others to develop a cogent theory. Sexual reproduction, with its accompanying mechanisms of meiosis and contrivances that promote cross-fertilization, brings forth innumerable gene combinations which are tested for fitness by natural selec- tion. A Mendelian population is, therefore, a laboratory for experimentation with genetic materials. From this ex- perimentation come evolutionary inventions. To be sure,</page><page sequence="12">412 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [Vol. LXXXIV such inventions can also be made without sex, by a lucky concatenation of mutational steps. But the probability of success is vastly increased by sexual reproduction. This is why sex has become established as the prevalent method of reproduction in higher organisms. The deterioration of sexuality which has taken place in some groups, chiefly among plants, does not contradict this view. Natural selec- tion is not a spirit endowed with foresight but a mechanism which is basically opportunistic; it favors changes that are immediately useful, regardless of their eventual harmful- ness. The advantages of an assured seed set, and other temporary benefits discussed by Stebbins (1950), account for losses of sexuality in evolution. The integration of individuals into Mendelian popula- tions, into sexual supraorganisms if you will, is an evolu- tionary adaptation. The further integration of elementary Mendelian populations into populations of higher orders, such as races and species, is likewise adaptive. It can be shown that formation of races and species has become necessary owing to the great diversity of environments found on our planet. In an absolutely homogeneous and constant environment, two or more genetically different groups of organisms could not coexist indefinitely. As pointed out by Gause, this is because one kind would in the long run prove more efficient, and would outbreed and crowd out the others. A single genotype, or at most a single Mendelian population, could exist in an absolutely homogeneous universe. In such a single population, new genotypes of superior fitness might emerge from time to time, and displace the ancestral genotypes. In principle, evolution is, therefore, compatible with the existence of a single kind of organism in the universe, instead of the immense diversity of organisms which actually prevails. However that may be, the world in which we live is far from homogeneous. The diversity in space is most obvi- ous: different climates and biotic conditions are encoun- tered in different parts of the world. Adaptation to this geographic diversity of environments necessitates a corre-</page><page sequence="13">No. 819] MENDELIAN POPULATIONS 413 spending genetic divergence of populations that are allo- patric, i.e., inhabit different territories. It is this divergence which gives rise to allopatric Mendelian populations which differ in frequencies of genetic variants and which are termed races. If evolution consisted of allopatric differ- entiation alone, its outcome would be a single species, but one which would be more or less highly polytypic, i.e., split into numerous geographic races. A multiplicity of environments occur, however, also within the ambit of activity of a living individual, or within the distribution range of its sex cells, spores, or seeds. Different foods, different microclimates, several predators, parasites, etc., may occur within small areas. Adaptation to the variety of ecological niches which therefore exist in close proximity to each other, engenders in its turn the diverse life forms which are sympatric, i.e., live within terri- tories of the order of magnitude of the distribution means of an individual (see Mayr, 1947, for further discussion of allopatric and sympatric differentiation). Adaptive diversity of sympatric organisms takes two forms: polymorphism within a population and speciation. Sympatric organisms must, by definition, meet each other, and, if they reproduce sexually and by cross-fertilization, they may also mate and produce offspring. In the absence of genetically conditioned barriers to crossing, sexual sym- patric individuals will form, then, a single Mendelian popu- lation. Such a population would comprise a variety of genotypes each of which possesses high adaptive value in some of the different locally available environments. Such a population is called adaptively polymorphic. Polymorphism is, in fact, observed in populations of most species. It is doubtful if any sexual species is adaptively quite monomorphic. Some species and some local popu- lations are, however, strikingly more polymorphic than others. An attractive working hypothesis is therefore that the amount of polymorphism present in a species or a population is a function of the variety of adaptive niches which this population is able to conquer and exploit; poly-</page><page sequence="14">414 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [Vol. LXXXIV morphic species would accordingly be adaptively more versatile, and the relatively uniform ones more specialized. This hypothesis has been found to give a satisfactory ac- count, for example, of the different degrees of polymorphism observed in local populations and species of the willistoni group of Drosophila in Brazil (da Cunha, Burla and Dobz- hansky, 1950; Dobzhansky, Burla and da Cunha, 1950; Dobzhansky and Pavan, 1950). Adaptive systems based on intrapopulational polymor- phism have, however, a serious limitation. Adaptive types within a Mendelian population interbreed, and gene segre- gation takes place in the progeny. So long as the forms crossed differ in only a single or in a few genes (or in bal- anced polygenic complexes, such as those guarded by inver- sions in chromosomes of Drosophila populations), the segre- gation products can fit into one or another of the adaptive niches which the whole population occupies. But, with the progress of evolution of life, adaptive systems have ap- peared which involve integrated systems of numerous genes. Suppose, for example, that the genotype A1B1C1Dl ... enables its possessors to be water-dwelling, and the geno- type A2B2C2D2 . . . to be terrestrial animals. The recombi- nation products A'B2C'D2..., A2B1C2D ..., etc., may be altogether disharmonious and unable to exist either in water or on land. Using Wright's very apt metaphor, the original genotypes occupy " adaptive peaks," and the re- combinations fall down into " adaptive valleys." The well-adapted genotypes, A1B1C1D1... and A2B2C2D2 ... could maintain themselves in allopatric populations and could live in different territories separated by a geographic barrier. However, if the ecological niches to which each genotype is suited should exist in both territories, then only one of them would be occupied, leaving the other niche empty, in both territories. On the other hand, should the two populations become sympatric, their members would hybridize. The resulting gene exchange and recombination would give rise to a mass of disharmonious genotypes, which would pull down the level of adaptedness of both</page><page sequence="15">No. 819] MENDELIAN POPULATIONS 415 populations concerned. In reality, this dilemma is avoided quite simply. The populations become sympatric and occupy all the adaptive niches for which they are suited, but only because hybridization and gene exchange between them are prevented, or made rare enough, so that the adaptedness of the populations remains high. This is ex- actly what is observed in nature: gene exchange between sympatric Mendelian populations is reduced or suppressed by a great variety of reproductive isolating mechanisms. The writer has suggested, as early as 1935, that species are reproductively isolated Mendelian populations. The process of speciation must, then, be regarded as an evolu- tionary adaptation which permits the development of immense organic diversity, particularly the diversity of sympatric species. Between one and two million species of animals and plants have developed on the earth neither to please nor to plague biologists and collectors. This diversity of species is a device which enables life to exploit the multiform opportunities offered by the environment. Speciation is accordingly a form of integration of Mendelian populations engendered by natural selection in response to the challenge of the diversity of sympatric environments. In view of the more than century-long, and notoriously inconclusive, debate about what species are, it is gratifying that a fairly general agreement about the matter seems at last in the offing among biologists. It is recognized, except by a few conservatives, that the attainment of reproductive isolation between genetically diverging Mendelian popula- tions is the essence of biological speciation. Reproductive isolation between populations is, accordingly, the criterion for the recognition of the specific entities which have bio- logical meaning. Of course, it does not follow that different species are always " intersterile." It can not be too strongly emphasized that hybrid inviability and hybrid sterility are only two of the many kinds of reproductive isolating mechanisms. One could cite numerous instances in which fertile hybrids between species are known in the laboratory or in nature, or in both. What matters is not whether</page><page sequence="16">416 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [Vol. LXXXIV hybrids can be obtained but whether the Mendelian popu- lations do or do not exchange genes, and if they do whether at a rate which destroys the adaptive equilibrium of the populations concerned. Seasons of sexual maturity or of flowering, attraction of different species of insects for pollen transport, being members of different biotic communities in the same geographic region, weakness or lack of sexual attraction between members of different populations, are some of the reproductive isolating mechanisms which keep species genetically apart, despite the possibility of produc- tion of fertile hybrids under some circumstances. More- over, it is a very common situation that species are kept apart not by one but by several reproductive isolating mechanisms, none of which may be absolutely effective when taken alone, but which eliminate all gene exchange when combined. An example of this situation are the sib- ling species Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila per- similis. Hybrids between them are rather easily produced in the laboratory, and yet no hybrids have ever been found in nature, despite the side by side occurrence of the parental species in many habitats. Not only the presence but also the degree of reproductive isolation between species will be determined by the exi- gencies of adaptive evolution. Gene exchange between Mendelian populations is adaptively favorable or unfavor- able, depending upon the fitness of the recombination products in relation to the environment. If some of the recombination products are valuable in some environments, it is advantageous for species populations to keep open a more or less narrow channel for gene exchange. Hence the occurrence of introgressive hybridization between some spe- cies, and its absence between others. The evolutionary importance and the prevalence of introgressive hybridiza- tion have been, in this writer's opinion, greatly exaggerated by some authors. This controversial problem can not be discussed here in detail. Nevertheless it should be pointed out that no matter how common such hybridization may prove to be, the formation of reproductive isolating barriers</page><page sequence="17">No. 819] MENDELIAN POPULATIONS 417 between Mendelian populations must be considered one of the basic phenomena of evolution. In the last analysis, speciation is an adaptive accompaniment of sexual repro- duction, just as sexual reproduction is a corrective to the relative stability of the gene. Evolution, then, is a creative process, but not in the sense of being directed by some supernatural force, as has often been explicitly or implicitly supposed by vitalists and their modern successors, the finalists. Such a direction would still amount to an inexplicable caprice of a Creator or Di- rector, but a caprice lasting a billion years instead of the six biblical days. Evolution is creative because it involves the formation of previously non-existent coherent entities, Mendelian populations culminating in species; because these entities enable life to spread into and to exploit new environments more and more efficiently; and because evo- lution, like all creative processes, involves risk of failure or miscreation, in other words, partakes of the quality which, in application to human affairs, is called freedom. This gives to organic evolution a character which can be de- scribed again only by an anthropomorphic term, namely, a character of dignity. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The writer is indebted to Drs. A.
