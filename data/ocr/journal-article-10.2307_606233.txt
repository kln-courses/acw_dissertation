In some respects, the scope of this book is very limited, and Wasserstein himself asks, "why does any of this matter?" (p. 164). He an- swers that "as an example, or a case-study, of the development of a central institution in Islam ... [the Andalusi caliphate] is worthy of study, both for its similarities to other versions of itself and for its differences from them." But Wasserstein has done more here than provide a case-study of the caliphal in- stitution; he has also given us an excellent example of how provocative new answers can emerge when a historian goes be- yond traditional written sources to ask penetrating questions of other types of historical records. OLIVIA REMIE CONSTABLE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY Vorbild und Vernunft: Die Regelung von Lachen und Scherzen im mittelalterlichen Islam. By LUDWIG AMMANN. Arabis- tische Texte und Studien, vol. 5. Hildesheim: GEORG OLMS VERLAG, 1993. Pp. xii + 287. DM 49.80. With the proliferation in recent years of scholarship con- cerned with humor in the Arabic tradition, the appearance of a monograph laying down the law on laughter and jesting is ap- propriate and timely. Ludwig Ammann's Freiburg dissertation is a thorough and detailed study of medieval Islamic discussions on the permissibility and etiquette of such behavior, focussing in particular on prophetic hadith and its interpretation (Vorbild) but also considering contributions from the medical, philosoph- ical, and literary traditions (Vernunft). Beginning with a handful of inconsistent reports on the Prophet's comportment (he jested, he condemned jesting; he laughed heartily, he only occasion- ally smiled), Ammann shows how attempts to interpret and har- monize the evidence, in part under the influence of non-Islamic cultural norms, developed into articulated ethical stances of con- siderable sophistication. The work is lucidly organized, utilizing outline numbers. Ammann has probably made the right decision in discussing laughter and jesting separately, in two independent chapters, de- spite the close connections between the two subjects, which he is careful to point out. These chapters, the heart of the work, are framed by a "Vorspiel" and a "Nachspiel." The former deals with a number of preliminary and peripheral matters, including the lexicography of laughter and jesting (treated exhaustively), the medical tradition on laughter (divided on whether joy or wonder is its primary stimulus, and whether it is irrational or rational), and theological discussions of such points as God's laughter in the Qur'an (anthropomorphism) and God as agent of laughter and weeping (Qur'an 53:43: wa-annahu huwa adhaka wa-abka--determinism and free will). The Nachspiel considers briefly the social reality behind normative texts, and is followed by a conclusion summarizing the major points of the study. The central chapters on laughing and jesting are organized roughly chronologically, beginning with reports from the Pro- phet and their early interpretation, considering possible "out- side" influences, and tracing later developments, particularly in Islamic pietistic literature. The chapter on jesting also devotes a section to literary apologetics for jesting in adab works, and ap- pends an example of a contemporary ethical work that essen- tially continues the tradition. Despite the existence of hadith depicting the Prophet both smiling and laughing, Ammann shows that the general thrust of early hadith criticism was to emphasize rather the negative side of the evidence. He isolates four clusters of hadith expressing reservations about laughter, and subjects them to meticulous criticism of both the isndd and the matn. For the former he re- lies especially on the "common link" analysis formulated by Schacht and pursued further by Juynboll, although he seems on the whole to be somewhat more optimistic, not to say credu- lous, about the possible historicity of hadith than either of those scholars, arguing in a number of cases, here and else- where, and sometimes rather defensively, for probable authen- ticity. Two of these hadith were particularly important for later discussions, the "Intensitatsregel"-the Prophet only smiled, rather than laughing-which Ammann finds to be a distortion of an earlier less pointed anecdote, and the "Frequenzregel"-the Prophet forbade too-frequent laughter as "fatal to the heart"- which he shows to be a back formation from a statement orig- inally attributed to al-Hasan al-Basri. The minuteness and speculativeness of Ammann's isnad criticism at times strains credibility (and concentration), but it does produce a rich pic- ture of the emergence of the hadith and their manipulation. Pressure to emphasize the strictures against laughter came pri- marily from ascetic circles, especially those of Basra, whose role Ammann sketches, noting as well, and importantly, the existence of non-ascetic pious scholars, such as Ibn Sirin, who opposed such excessive restraint. Ammann then turns to the question of outside influences, most obviously those from ascetic Christian- ity, and sensibly takes a middle position between what he calls "influence" and "convergence" in attitudes, pointing appositely to the importance here of conversion. More briefly considered are possible influences from "Greek" (primarily the pseudonymous Aristotle-Alexander correspondence), Persian, and pre-Islamic Arab traditions, all urging restraint in laughter; the pre-Islamic Arab evidence adduced takes the form mostly of poetic praise of women's reserve, but Ammann does not do much to pursue po- tentially interesting questions of gender differentiation. The main problem confronting pietistic opponents of laughter was a group of reports stating that the Prophet "laughed until his 491</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 115.3 (1995) molars (nawajidh) showed," and their proposed solutions evince a certain degree of desperation, including a redefinition of nawajidh as front teeth and a claim that the Prophet smiled in a peculiar fashion so that his molars showed, as well as the simple expedient of declaring prophetic laughter the exception to the "smiling" rule. Looking ahead to later developments, Ammann suggests that the contradictions posed by these hadith were "fruitful," in the sense both of deepening discussions and of serving as a brake on excessive otherworldliness. He points in particular to the increasing importance in later discussions (by al-Mawardi and al-Ghazali, among others) of the distinction be- tween friendly and derisive laughter. Ammann's chapter on jesting is somewhat more elaborate. He begins by citing seven hadith reporting jests made by the Prophet (none of which are very funny, and several are downright cryp- tic); after tortuous isnad criticism Ammann decides for the pos- sible authenticity of most of these and the probable authenticity of two, rejecting only two, transmitted via al-Hasan al-Basri, which involve rather heavy-handed teasing of women and which Ammann labels "misogynistic." But ultimately more influential than accounts of the Prophet's own jests was what Ammann calls the "central hadith," according to which the Prophet declared, "I jest and I speak only the truth." I find Ammann's analysis of the history of this statement particularly unconvincing. Tracing it back to a (supposedly) earlier version, in which the Prophet re- sponds to his Companions' remark that "you are jesting with us!" with "I speak only the truth," he suggests that this exchange may originally have meant nothing more than "you're kidding!" and "honest truth!" and that in any event the Prophet was opposing truth-telling to jesting. The later version, he claims, represents a harmonizing tendency, which granted the validity of reports of the Prophet's jesting but insisted that he indulged only in true jests, not lying ones; and he seems to take umbrage at those who think they can so easily divide jesting into "truthful" and "lying," without recognizing that the situation is much more complicated. I am convinced neither that the "earlier" version of the Prophet's declaration opposes "truth" to jesting, nor that the distinctions made by the commentators between "true" and "lying" jests are necessarily so specious. Turning to the cultural context of and "influences" on the pro- cess of rulemaking, Ammann shows that complaints about jest- ing in pre- and early Islamic sources, both religious and secular, see it primarily as a threat to personal dignity and a potential cause of social dissension. The former danger is also stressed by traditional Persian advice literature, geared mainly to princes and aristocrats-which, however, also encourages jesting, at the appropriate time and with the appropriate company, as a neces- sary refreshment (Erholung) from the taxing duties of ruling. This positive argument was taken up by Islamic authors, both religious and secular, who substituted the exertions of pious or literary study for the pressures of rulership. Ammann devotes a separate section of his study to treat- ments of the problem of jesting in adab literature, which usually served as apologetic introductions to more or less massive re- portage of jokes and jests themselves. Citing but criticizing some common definitions of adab as fundamentally "edifying," he suggests (to my mind, correctly) that "there is no unifying theme of adab literature," but nevertheless largely presupposes the "edification" model in his subsequent discussion. He sees al-Jahiz's apologia for jesting as a break with Ibn al-Muqaffa?s strict segregation of serious and entertaining literatures (but what about Kalila wa-Dimna?) and as a "secularization" of the "Erholung" principle, the lighter parts of al-Jahiz's writing (no- tably in the Hayawan) being mixed in as comic relief. For Ibn Qutayba, equally positive toward jesting, he shows how the stress is rather on the view (based on Qur'fn and hadith) of Is- lam as a relatively indulgent religion (compared, especially, to the strictures of Jewish law), and on the practical expedient of including jesting in his work so as to appeal to a wider audience. Later authors identified as sharing the views of al-Jfhiz and Ibn Qutayba include Ibn CAbd Rabbihi, al-Abi, Ibn al-Jawzi, Ibn Daniyal, and al-Nuwayri. In documenting the popularity of the "Erholung" motif and related arguments, Ammann seems to me to have succeeded in tracing the formation of a cliche, but also to have taken such pronouncements a little too much at their word, ignoring, for instance, the ribaldry and scatology which follows Ibn Daniyal's token nod to the conventions. Having focussed intensively on the normative tradition, Am- mann is aware that the question of social reality will have formed itself in the reader's mind, and he devotes some com- ments (explicitly labelled as "essayistisch") to this problem in his Nachspiel. He properly points out that there must have been variations in practice over time and space, giving as illustra- tions the Medinese reputation for frivolity and the loosening of court protocol under Yazid II; but he seems to me to be if anything too timid in suggesting that later "waves" of piety and permissiveness may perhaps be detectable from textual evidence. Inevitably, he refers to the famous account of the twice-a-week orgies, behind closed doors, of the otherwise dignified Qadi al-Tanukhi and his colleagues in tenth-century Baghdad, and rightly stresses for all periods the sharp dis- tinction made between public and private behavior, a point perhaps somewhat understressed in his discussions of the nor- mative tradition. He then cites a series of European travellers' and diplomats' accounts which remark on the comparative sedateness and dignity of comportment they observed among the peoples of the Middle East, including Lane's observations on nineteenth-century Egypt; striking (and perhaps surprising) as some of these are, they raise more questions than they an- swer, and can only be considered suggestive. But what Ammann is really concerned about in this brief look at social "reality" is the degree of "influence" exercised by the normative tradition on society. He states that "it would be foolish to believe that the regulations dictating restraint (Massigungs- gebote) were followed universally and to the letter-just as fool- ish as it would be to suppose that they exercised no influence 492</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books (Einfluss) at all on behavior." This statement is undoubtedly true, but suggests a rather mechanistic (optimistic?) view of the power of texts or "official" norms. While general societal mores are invoked early in the book as "influences" on the formation of the norms enshrined in religious and ethical texts, at the end they are presented rather as subject to "influences" from these norms themselves; it seems to me that the interplay is both more com- plex, and in a way more constant, than such a picture admits. In fact, Ammann's description of the process of "rule-building" (Regelbildung) throughout his book sounds rather like that of writing a dissertation. It goes through "stages," which have "as- signments" and achieve "progress"; and the "Meinungskanon" is gradually enriched with new ideas, whose appearance Am- mann attempts to date with some precision. (His detailed isnad criticism is partly intended as a way of getting the entry of specific elements into the tradition into proper chronological order.) And that there be unflagging "progress" is very impor- tant to Ammann, who assures us that "wissenschaftliche Fort- schritt" did not break down even in the later periods. Such evaluative comments are rather frequent. In accordance with the value he ascribes to independent thought and "progress," Ammann is disdainful of those later authors (such as al-Raghib al-Isfahani in his Muhddardt) who contented themselves with "documentation" rather than "synthesis," and remarks that "cer- tainly in such cases the impression of intellectual poverty is not unjustified. Nevertheless, one should not lose sight of the fact that a research report (Forschungsbericht) can also have its uses." He is not overfond either of representatives of the negative "narrow synthesis" on laughing and jesting, although he grants that they "have every right" to ignore as unimportant the positive sides of the tradition. Personally, he prefers the "broad synthe- sis," because of its "greater insight into the actual ambivalence of jesting." There is one figure against whom Ammann displays true an- imus, accusing him repeatedly of dishonesty. This is al-Washsha' (or, as Ammann prefers, Ibn al-Washsha'), the tenth-century author of a guide to elegant living, the Muwashsha, which de- votes an early chapter to the "prohibition of jesting with (or teas- ing) one's friends." Al-Washsha's presentation of this topic is unquestionably one-sided, and while he cites some dozen author- ities (in prose and poetry), the Prophet is nowhere mentioned (al- though hadith do appear elsewhere in the book). It is this omission that Ammann finds "dishonest," condemning it as sup- pression of "the most important tradition, the example of Mu- hammad, in order to pronounce an unqualified prohibition (of jesting)." But the Muwashsha is hardly the astringent rulebook Ammann seems to consider it, and it is highly improbable that its urbane author really wished to ban humor from human society- especially as he explicitly devoted the second half of his book, after the "seriousness" (jidd) of the first half, to "hazl" or humor. That section is introduced, to be sure, with the conventional "Erholung" (tarwih) justification; but here as elsewhere Ammann is inclined to take such protestations perhaps a little too seriously. When we are offered al-Abi's more elaborate, and apparently quite earnest, reiteration of the same argument, we should also keep in mind that al-Abi in fact included such a wealth of hu- morous material (much of it scabrous) in his encyclopedia that it became the single most influential joke book in all of Arabic literature (as has been shown by Ulrich Marzolph). Despite Am- mann's allegiance to the "broader synthesis" on the question of laughing and jesting, his picture of both life and literature in medieval Islamic society is, I think, on the whole considerably grimmer than what the evidence actually suggests. Physically, Vorbild und Vernunft is well arranged, with fre- quent subheadings, footnotes at the bottom of the page, and full bibliography and index. Misprints and factual errors are few. Something has gone wrong with page formatting at pp. 1 lf., 32, and 34; at 32 a few lines of text have been lost. The sans serif font is ugly and cramped-"rn" and "m" are almost indistin- guishable-and the type of the footnotes, as well as many sec- tions of the text, is tiny; footnote flags are almost microscopic and essentially illegible. Non-native German readers will find Ammann's style somewhat convoluted, with a decided pen- chant for withholding the subject in each sentence until the last possible moment (for an extreme example, see p. 84, n. 6). Nevertheless, with proper lighting, Ludwig Ammann's Vor- bild und Vernunft does admirably fulfill its claim to be "a con- tribution to the history of Islamic ethics." By ranging widely through the literature, while subjecting it to careful and acute analysis, Ammann has provided us with a thorough guide to Islamic views on a specific ethical problem and an excellent example of the interaction of Model and Mind in the ethical tradition.
