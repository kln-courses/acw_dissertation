The authors' stated aim is to provide a laboratory handbook giving full practical details of the more successful method of growing animal parasites in vitro. The aim is not completely realized due to lack of fullness of the stated practical details and omissions of critical evaluations when multiple but similar media are presented. A preliminary section on crude materials used in compounding media would have been invaluable. For example, it would have been useful for the beginner to have been told that both gelatin and casein hydrolysates are good sources for amino acids but that the casein preparations frequently also contain vitamins and lipids. Such information would reduce the mystery of how one goes about progressing from crude to defined media. One striking omission in the hemoflagellate section is a critical evaluation of methods for solution stability and storage of hemin. A strange selection is made in the section on almost-defined media for Trypanosoma cruzi in which three media are mentioned but only two out of the three are presented. The choice is an odd one since the omitted medium-that of Citri &amp; Grossowicz (1955)-comes closest to the desired complete definition with good growth. The case can be made in detail here of the general problem of failing to discuss multiple media according to comparative ability to yield prolific growth and as a stepping-stone toward the final goal of optimal completely-defined media. The helminth section would have profited from an introductory chapter on the general state of the art of cultivation of free-living invertebrates and the types of media supplementation required to allow these organisms to progress through their normal morphological stages. Once more, critical assessment would convert this book from an incomplete listing of media to a valuable teaching tool. The authors write clearly and have presented a good starting bibliography to guide the novice on to the next steps when used as part of a lecture course in which the instructor can fill in the more sophisticated nutritional and bio- chemical interpretations.-HELENE N. GUTTMAN, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, Chicago Nematode Parasites of Domestic Animals and of Man by Norman D. Levine, Burgess, Minneapolis, 1968, iii + 600 pp., illus., $24.50. The second in a projected series of books on animal parasites (the first, which appeared in 1961, dealt with protozoan parasites and has become a widely used and authoritative reference book on the subject), the present volume repre- sents an heroic and successful attempt to bring together data on parasitic mem- bers of the vast phylum Nematoda which have been found, to a greater or lesser degree, in association with domestic animals and/or man. Succeeding volumes are planned to deal with other helminths and with arthropods. Following the pattern established in the work on protozoan parasites, Dr. Levine, wherever possible, has for each genus considered its included species, giving proper nomenclatural data and anatomical descriptions, and then treated these topics in order: life cycle, cultivation, pathogenesis, epidemiology, im- munity, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention and control. After an introductory chapter, natural groupings of nematodes are treated in some 16 chapters, each chapter having its own bibliographic section. A useful appendix of generic, proprietary, and chemical names of some anthelmintics is followed by a nearly exhaustive index in 15 pages of small print in three columns. Although the pertinent literature is extensive, there are-as Levine points out-still many gaps in our knowledge of the subject. His important volume has done a great deal in not only bringing together properly what is known but</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 321 also focussing attention on the most significant gaps and stimulating new re- searches to be undertaken in such areas. No parasitologist can afford to be without this work, and many other biologists would also benefit from the information conveniently available only in it.-J.O.C. Biodeterioration of Materials, Microbiological and Allied Aspects edited by A. Harry Walters and John J. Elphick. Elsevier, Amsterdam, London, New York, 1969, x + 740 pp., illus., $39. This weighty volume represents a compilation of the papers presented at the 1st International Biodeterioration Symposium held in September 1968 in Southampton, England. A majority of the participants were scientists from Great Britain; their contributions have been published under some 12 headings or "parts" of the book. In order to insure rapid appearance, no overall summaries, addenda, or indexes could be incorporated in the volume. Each of the articles (and there are over 65 separate papers), however, contains its own bibliography. Biodeterioration, defined properly, covers a very wide field of study, extending well beyond the popular concepts of "rotting" or "mildewing." Hardly any material exists which is not subject to either full or partial breakdown caused by vital activities of some organism, a destruction which is undesirable from man's point of view. Thus we have an applied science dependent, naturally, on dis- coveries made primarily through basic research approaches. The book, covering topics ranging from microbiological deterioration of ma- terials in deep mines to marine boring and fouling organisms and from fungal contamination of Florentine masterpieces to a new look at moldy cocoa, is a valuable collection of up-to-date papers in a relatively new field of science and will certainly represent an important addition to the library of biologists interested in any of the vast number of aspects of biodeterioration.-J.O.C. Big Fleas Have Little Fleas or Who's Who Among the Protozoa by Robert Hegner. Dover Publications, New York, 1968, viii + 285 pp., 127 figs., $2. Some 30 years ago Williams and Wilkins published the original edition of this remarkable little volume, but the time was not right: War followed Depres- sion, and Dr. Hegner passed away (in 1943); and so there are few biologists, even protozoologists, who today possess a copy of the work as it was first printed. Thus I'm certain that this reviewer's delight over the Dover paperback publication will be shared by many; it is a pleasure to call the reader's attention to new availability of the book-and at a price many times less than one must pay today for most volumes of no greater size. It should be stressed that text, figures (marginal and otherwise), even appendices, are identical with the original; the only addition is a brief and kindly introduction by Dr. Reginald D. Manwell, a now retired protozoologist who was one of Dr. Hegner's most devoted, and most illustrious, students. Big Fleas Have Little Fleas is hardly a textbook of protozoology, but it should be taken seriously even if the bulk of the figures are (deliberately) humorous sketches with highly anthropomorphic overtones. Much good infor- mation is presented in a very palatable way. Dr. Hegner's own deep interest in parasitic protozoa shows through, of course, but it is fashionable, especially today, to emphasize one's own specialties in a book which could not possibly cover all topics equally adequately. Every student of protozoologv and parasitology, not to mention those of many other "ologies," should have his own copy of this light-hearted Who's Who, a work which will always remain charming and unique.-J.O.C.</page></plain_text>
