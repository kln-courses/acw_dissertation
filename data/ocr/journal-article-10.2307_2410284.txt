Why is he white with such a ridiculously long tail and not brown and relatively inconspicuous like his female? Andersson's and M0ller's books don't provide the answers, but they give cause for optimism that we are getting close to them. Andersson describes the current status of research on sex- ually selected traits in both plants and animals (or at least, given the frequently appearing papers on sexual selection, the status of the field in 1993). He does this by making each of his 17 chapters an in-depth review of a particular topic in sexual selection (e.g., models, mating systems, constraints, plants, sexual size dimorphism). It is a remarkable book, one of balance and critical evaluation. In clear and concise writing, hundreds of studies are reviewed. Results from theory or data with strong support are emphasized, whereas speculations are downplayed or ignored. Many researchers will use this book as an entry into the literature. We have all heard about guppies, red deer, tiny males, nuptial gifts, giant flowers, etc. but few have taken the time to read about them in depth. Andersson has read about them all. Andersson's review can be used to identify areas of current controversy, as well as those neglected experimental and theoretical areas that seem ready for explo- sive growth. I will consider some topics below, before turning to M0ller's case study of the swallow. All examples are drawn from Andersson's book, unless credited elsewhere. Diversity.-Exciting work on artificial neural networks has shown that perception biases favoring both exaggerated traits and symmetrical ornaments can arise as a side effect of se- lection for recognition (besides Andersson, see Enquist and Arak 1994; Johnstone 1994). It has been suggested that a "sense of beauty" in humans and other animals is a shared result of similar neural networking mechanisms and similar biases in perception. Andersson's book demonstrates how mis- leading such an anthropomorphic view can be. The most im- pressive thing is not the beauty, but the enormous diversity of sexually selected traits. Apart from traits that we tradition- ally call beautiful, sexual selection has produced some of the ugliest, too. It is doubtful that a female turkey finds a fine male's wattle or gobble any less appealing than the peahen finds her mate's many eyespots, or the female swallow her male's tail. Beauty and ugliness become even more difficult to define in other senses. Unlike the female mormyrid fish, few of us like electric shocks. "Our noses being what they I Sexual Selection.

Andersson does a great job at describing the pressures af- fecting individual traits, but provides no synthesis to explain the variety. Andersson admits this, with an illustration from his own back yard. One warbler species' song is a monotonous churr, another's a melodious medley of songs (with mimicry of over 100 other species recorded). The explanation for such differences seems a long way off. Not only is there tremendous diversity across species and taxonomic groups in the kinds of traits subject to selection, there are many sexually selected traits within one individual (e.g., a male bird sings, displays, is brightly colored, and holds a territory). The causes of this variety are even less well understood. Often these traits span several sensory modalities (e.g., visual, acoustic, and olfactory systems), and they must interact. The causes of the diversity and the consequences of their interaction are largely ignored by Andersson, but M0ller has a go in his book, making the point that a great many facets of an individual's life history, not just the immediate premating period, are affected by sexual selection pressures (e.g., timing of arrival on the breeding grounds is subject to selection, and this in turn depends on molt on the wintering grounds). Monomorphism.-The reasons for differences in secondary sexual traits between males and females can be understood in terms of potential reproductive rates, the mating system, and differences in parental care. But much remains to be explained, and this is illustrated most strikingly by the debate about monomorphism, which is understood far less well than di- morphism. Many species are monomorphic, and some of these are very bright (e.g., puffins). Andersson discusses a number of possible reasons for this such as a role for male choice of females, or competition between females for mates. None seem entirely satisfactory, especially as phylogenetic studies indi- cate that transitions between monomorphism and dimorphism are often a consequence of female evolution (see also Irwin 1994). Indeed, one of the best examples of reproductive char- acter displacement (in a damselfly species) is displacement in the female trait. Some species have polymorphic females, in which one morph resembles the male and the other does not. In the Batesian mimicry systems in Papilio butterflies, the females that do not look like the males mimic toxic species (Clarke and Sheppard 1969). Since there is clear adaptive sig- nificance to the mimic form, this system seems to be an ex- cellent one for studying the reasons for the malelike form. Speciation.-Less than 5% of Andersson's book is devoted to a discussion of the relationship between sexual selection and speciation, reflecting the difficulty of making progress in this area. What do we know? Andersson makes three</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 579 points. (1) Sexual selection has been implicated in speciation by the finding of correlations between the number of species in a clade and the presence of traits, such as complex female sense organs, that are likely to be associated with sexual selection (see also Barraclough et al. 1995). (2) The rela- tionship between the accumulation of pre- and postmating isolation is beginning to be clarified. Selection against hybrid matings clearly influences mate choice, and there is some evidence for both reinforcement and reproductive character displacement (in both sexually selected traits and in mating preferences). (3) The extent to which sexual selection in al- lopatric populations can produce complete reproductive iso- lation seems to be largely undetermined, and there are few good examples. Indeed there are apparent counterexamples in which heterospecifics are still favored by females. Geographical Variation.-Reading Andersson's book, one is struck by how many studies have relied on either compar- isons among species or studies within single populations. With a few exceptions (e.g., on guppies, house finches, and a little bit on the swallow), little advantage has been taken of the considerable variation among populations and subspecies. Our understanding of both monomorphism and speciation, and many other questions in sexual selection, could perhaps be advanced by paying more attention to geographical variation. For example, Andersson notes that geographical variation in color dimorphism is known in butterflies, lizards, and birds, all of which have species with both monomorphic and di- morphic populations. In the swallow, a sexually almost mono- morphic trait (red coloration) varies extensively geographi- cally and between species. Its significance is unknown and has yet to be investigated. Mayr's (1942) theories of speciation were derived from studies of geographical variation. His ob- servation (p. 55) that "it would be extremely valuable to get some information on the geographical variation of courtship patterns, display posture and so forth" is finally likely to be taken up in the context of sexual selection. Male Competition.-An important dichotomy in studies of sexual selection has been between the roles of competition among members of the same sex and choice between the sexes. Competition among members of the same sex has been relatively neglected, but Andersson gives it considerable at- tention, with chapters on weapons and, on body size, and discussion of other forms of competition that do not involve fights (scrambles and endurance). Male competition may even lead to the evolution of male ornaments, with female choice having only a secondary role. Fisher (1958, p. 155) suggested that "fine feathers and triumphant song are quite as well adapted for war-propaganda as courtship." Andersson men- tions several recent studies that support the idea. Muted male songbirds lose their territories, as do males whose coloration has been dulled by painting, whereas brightened males get bigger territories. The evolutionary explanation is a mystery to me. A vireo that sings 22,000 times in one day should presumably be somewhat tired and more easily defeated in a fight by one that had decided to spend the day resting and feeding. There is apparently no theoretical treatment. The issue is not discussed in either book under review. Two pos- sibilities come to mind. First, interactions occur among many males, not just two, and there are several examples where males copy songs of a dominant male apparently in order to fool other males. Second, some traits may affect both male competition and female choice. For example, males that sing loudly could be simultaneously advertising to both females and other males, but female choice is the main directional selection pressure. Some traits, including some songs, do seem to be used in both combat and courtship. Andersson points out that the context in which traits are used has been relatively neglected and deserves more study. Good Genes.-Active fields of research thrive on contro- versy, especially when it can be polarized into two alternative views. The main controversy and much research effort in sexual selection have centered on the reason for female pref- erences, with the alternatives being the indicator (also known as handicap, good genes) versus Fisherian (arbitrary, runa- way) models. Andersson notes that Fisher, in 1915, first dis- cussed the indicator model. The idea is that expression of the secondary sexual trait covaries with heritable male qual- ity, or condition (e.g., parasite resistance), favoring females that choose males with exaggerated traits; females may also gain direct benefits from mating with high-condition males. Fisher obviously discussed the Fisherian mechanism as well. The idea is that the female preference evolves as a correlated response to sexual and natural selection on the male trait. Some recent experiments that purport to demonstrate a ge- netic correlation notwithstanding, indicator mechanisms are currently in favor. Andersson asks, "Is this because reality is being more accurately portrayed, or is there a new myth in the making?" He does not provide the answer, but makes some telling points. For example, flower color evolution is driven by pollinators in which Fisherian mechanisms are of- ten impossible (unless the pollinators are themselves subject to runaway sexual selection). It appears that many secondary sexual traits are condition- dependent and hence may function as indicators. Simple mechanisms can start the process of sexual selection, such as sensory biases that have evolved in other contexts, or shifts in the background habitat making male features suddenly conspicuous. As soon as sexual selection is initiated, the sexually selected traits are often under selection to become condition-dependent, and this places new selection pressures on the female preference. Condition Dependence.-Condition dependence can result in alternative mating strategies, and possibly several puzzling observations in sexual selection may make more sense if it is found that variation in condition and associated fitness consequences are much larger than currently appreciated. The consequences are not fully developed in either book, but the diversity of sexually selected traits may partly reflect differ- ent selection pressures acting on different segments of the population. For example, in the swallow, males with long tails (and therefore in good condition) provide less parental care than those with shorter tails. Condition dependence has created many difficulties in the empirical study of sexual selection. In several studies males with high mating success (both inside and outside the pair bond) have high viability, whereas others have both low mat- ing and survival prospects. The sexually selected trait appears to be under directional selection throughout the life history, but remains heritable. In fact, direct selection on the trait is stabilizing, and heritability can be maintained in the same</page><page sequence="3">580 BOOK REVIEWS way as it is in other traits subject to stabilizing selection. The effects of condition have meant that the search for se- lective pressures opposing the further development of the trait under sexual selection are hard or impossible to detect by correlative studies. If opposing pressures are present, they can be masked by the positive effects of condition on all aspects of the life history. Andersson concludes "there is still no quantitative empirical study of a balance between natural and sexual selection on a secondary sexual trait." M0ller might dispute this. In his book M0ller summarizes 10 yr of intensive work on the migratory monogamous barn swallow. The study is already a classic. In retrospect, anyone who walks into a barn and sees abundant swallows flying through a narrow door could kick themselves for not studying them. Not only are they numerous and easily caught in abundance, but those great banes of field studies on birds, nest predation and other effects of distur- bance, is of minimal importance in the swallow. Few, however, could have hoped to discover as much as M0ller has. M0ller's book parallels that of Andersson's in the early chapters, with a nonmathematical review of the theory. The rest of the chap- ters consider various topics in sexual selection, as directly applicable to the swallow data (e.g., time of arrival on the breeding grounds, role of parasites, sperm competition, geo- graphical variation in tail length). The swallow's tail is sexually dimorphic, with male tails about 20% longer than female tails. The male's tail is positively correlated with his mating success and viability, but experi- mental manipulations have shown that a longer tail increases mating success and decreases viability. The tail is phenotyp- ically plastic, and the most interesting part of the study con- cerns the impact of the tropical fowl mite on the biology of the swallow, and its tail. Long-tailed putative fathers have offspring that carry relatively few mites, even when those offspring are cross-fostered. This arises despite a high level of extrapair paternity, with short-tailed males often being cuck- olded by longer-tailed males. Mite resistance thus appears to be strongly heritable and to be indicated by tail length. The selection pressures affecting the plasticity in the swal- low's tail are better known than that of any other plastic trait: students of plasticity have largely ignored the literature on sexual selection, but there could be a profitable exchange of views. Relative to long-tailed males, short-tailed males have their survival prospects increased more by further shortening and decreased more by lengthening. The viability costs of the tail are thus greater for low-condition than for high-con- dition males, and this can explain the differing degrees of tail exaggeration among males in different condition. A major unanswered question raised by M0ller is why a female bases her choice on a trait that impairs male feeding ability and thus probably reduces her fecundity. His implicit solution is that tail length is the only suitable indicator of external par- asites. A penalty in terms of direct fitness costs is paid to reap the indirect fitness benefits. As noted earlier, this con- clusion may make more sense if variation in condition is much greater than we presently perceive. Unfortunately M0ller's book is not an easy read. Para- graphs are repeated almost word for word within the space of two pages. Different chapters are cross-referenced only rarely. Relevant data are sometimes not presented, not ana- lyzed, or analyzed incorrectly. Several interpretations are in- valid (e.g., on selection differentials, genotype-by-environ- ment interactions, and genetic correlations between the sexes). To take one example, Fisher argued that sexual se- lection favoring early-breeding males could arise through male mortality. Mortality is assumed to be random. Males that breed earliest get their genes out before dying, whereas those that are destined to breed later die without mating*. M0ller misinterprets Fisher's argument, finds random mor- tality, and concludes the mechanism is not operating. Con- fusingly, later in the book there is an example of nonrandom mortality, in association with an early cold spell. As a second example, M0ller considers three hypotheses for sexual di- morphism, but two are explanations for monomorphism, and other hypotheses are not considered. Much of the theory is also often irrelevant to the task at hand, and complex models are confusingly, incompletely, or wrongly presented (e.g., on clines, runaway conditions, epistatic indicators, fitness max- imization). This is an edited series, and one wonders how all this could have slipped through an editorial process. Ignoring these failings, one can read M0ller's book for the impressive data set and as a report on the most comprehensive study on sexual selection ever undertaken. Both books touch on some areas that are likely to be huge growth fields in sexual selection, and whose surface has been barely scratched. These include strategies for extrapair cop- ulation and its prevention, sperm competition, and variable female reproductive investment, all discussed in some detail by M0ller. Other examples include molecular recognition sys- tems (Andersson mentions the self-incompatibility systems of plants and the MHC loci), genetic and neurological bases to preferences, and the role of the sex chromosomes and dosage compensation (Hastings 1994). Culture is largely ignored, but given recent attempts to explain human beauty and behavior in the context of animal models, it is to be hoped it will be given more prominence in the future. Even if we can finally explain the plumage of the male paradise flycatcher, there are many more questions waiting round the corner. LITERATURE CITED Barraclough, T G., P. H. Harvey, and S. Nee. 1995.
