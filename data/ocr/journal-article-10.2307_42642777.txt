<plain_text><page sequence="1">research in review The Consequences of Early Childbearing by Joseph H. Stevens, Jr. The family is the crucible for the de- velopment of children. Its ability to nurture and respond decisively to meet the developmental needs of its children affects how they will function as adults. The very young mother and father are generally less able than their older counterparts to perform these functions because of attenuated education, more limited incomes, greater marital disrup- tion, and more offspring. This review will examine how early parenthood can result in fewer resources with which to nurture and care for children, and will discuss the implications for needed support services to teenagers. The Magnitude of Early Childbearing In 1975 one birth in five was to a woman 19 years of age or younger. The number of births to girls 15-17 years of age increased 22 percent from 1966 to 1975. In 1976, 1,100,000 teenage preg- nancies resulted in 570,672 live births, 378,500 abortions and 152,000 miscar- riages or stillbirths (Tietze 1979). There are more teenage mothers among whites than among Blacks, but the birth rate among Black teenagers is higher than among white teenagers. Black teenagers are more likely than whites to have premarital sexual intercourse and then become pregnant (Zelnick and Kanter 1978). Many of the large number of sexually active teenagers use contraceptives in- consistently and ineffectively. Other factors helping to bring about pregnancy among young girls include early and frequent social activity; early menarche; lack of knowledge about fertility, con- ception, and birth control; and early election of parenthood as a career. Social and cultural factors help determine how the pregnancy is resolved and the long term consequences of early childbearing and parenthood. For example, Blacks choose abortion and adoption as alter- natives much less frequently than whites. Ethnic and cultural membership, social class, and family structure help shape the outcome of early parenthood for both parent and child. Educational Attainment Early parenthood often shortens edu- cational attainment for women and men, and the attenuation is greater for women than for men (Card and Wise 1978). Moore (1978) found that women having their first child at age 15 com- pleted two years less schooling than women who were still childless at 24. These younger women did not catch up during their young adulthood. For all women 22 to 34, those who had chil- dren when they were age 15 or younger completed fewer years of school than those having children even at age 16 or 17. White teenage mothers lost more schooling than Black women; however, substantial educational setbacks occurred for both groups. This is one of a regular series of columns edited by Joseph H.

Only half of the teen mothers were graduated from high school by the end of the five-year fol- lowup, compared to more than 80 percent of their classmates. More non- premaritally pregnant classmates com- pleted high school and enrolled in post- secondary education than did teen- age mothers. Even those comparison classmates who experienced a premarital pregnancy later in adolescence were more likely to have completed high school and to have enrolled in post- secondary education than were the very young teenage mothers. These young teenage mothers' school careers were, however, uneven. They did not uni- formly drop out of school without ever returning. Personal and familial characteristics such as support from family members, academic ambition, and academic com- petence were related to amount of schooling completed. An index of edu- cational ambition, which reflected edu- cational goals, desire to return to school, educational expectations, and educa- tional goals in relation to their friends, strongly predicted educational attain- ment. Teen mothers with high educa- tional ambition were much more likely to complete school than mothers with low ambition (85 percent versus 8 per- cent). Academic competence was also related to schooling completed; those girls who were at or below grade level were more likely to drop out. Adolescent mothers who perceived themselves as more com- petent students were more likely to complete high school. Mothers' expecta- tions of their teenage daughters signifi- cantly influenced the girls' completion of high school. Less than one-fifth of the women whose mothers had high educa- tional expectations for them dropped out of school, compared with over two- thirds of the women whose mothers had low expectations. Economic Consequences Delay of childbearing is associated with dramatic economic consequences, especially for women. Card and Wise (1978) reported that adolescent mothers had significantly lower incomes and were more likely to work in less presti- gious jobs than women delaying child- bearing. However, teenage fathers' in- comes were not significantly different than those of classmates deferring fatherhood, though teen fathers were more likely to be blue collar workers. Moore (1978) estimated that women at age 27 who had delayed having their first child earned about $153 dollars more per year for every year of delay. Further, women delaying their first preg- nancy tended to reside in households where other earners contributed ap- proximately $1,220 per year in addi- tional income for each year of delay. Half of the Aid to Families with De- pendent Children (AFDC) funds distrib- uted in 1975 were directed to women whose first child was born when they were adolescents (Moore 1978). This to- talled 4.65 billion dollars, not including Medicaid (estimated at $161 per child), food stamps (estimated at $286 per household), or prenatal care and deliv- ery (estimated at $1,135 per pregnancy). One additional finding from Moore's study illustrates the complex inter- relationships of these factors of adoles- cent pregnancy, educational attainment, and economic consequences. For all teenage mothers living in AFDC house- holds, those that completed high school were less likely to receive AFDC sub- sequently than those not completing high school. Young mothers who com- pleted high school were more likely to live in households receiving AFDC than were older teenagers completing high 48 Young Children</page><page sequence="3">r- in co CD "O Qi D 0 1 o N school. Thus welfare support may have enabled very young teenage mothers to achieve greater economic independence. Educational attainment was a potent predictor of economic well-being. Teenage mothers who go on welfare often become independent later. In Furstenberg's study (1976), a third of the women who reported being on welfare earlier were not receiving support five years after the baby's birth. Over the course of the longitudinal study, about two-thirds of the mothers received wel- fare at some time. Other research sup- ports a pattern of moving from job to welfare, to employment and non-welfare, and back again. Those teenagers most vulnerable to being on welfare were unmarried, with more children. Most of the women in the study re- ported wanting to work. Educational status was a strong predictor of employment; mothers with more schooling and higher educational aspi- rations were more likely to be working than those with less schooling and lower educational ambitions. The eco- nomic position or the structure of the family of origin (for example, female- headed versus two parent household) did not affect the probability of work- ing. However, family size was nega- tively related to the chances of working; teenage mothers with more children were less likely to be employed than were women with smaller families. The relationship of marriage to working was less evident. January 1980 49</page><page sequence="4">What were the patterns of economic support used by Black teenage parents in Furstenberg's study? Five years after the child's birth, the modal source of major income was the teen mother's own earnings (for about 25 percent of the mothers). Income from husband's employment and from welfare were the two most frequently reported major sources after the mother's own earnings. Three out of five teenage mothers were self-supporting or were the non working spouse of a working man. Sixty percent of the mothers reported some income from more than one source (own employment, husband's employment, welfare, parents, child's father, un- employment, social security). Nearly all (95 percent) reported receiving some money from their families. Early parenthood increases the likeli- hood that one will be on welfare for a portion of one's life. Two-fifths of the respondents received some of their in- come from welfare, and proportionately more of the teenage mothers than their classmates indicated that more of their income derived from welfare than from other sources. Seventy-five percent of the classmates were supporting them- selves in contrast to 45 percent of the teenage parents. Working mothers were better off eco- nomically than those on welfare. Teens living with a working spouse were bet- ter off than those unmarried; those who reported more sources of income seemed to be better off than those reporting fewer. However, about half of all mothers were earning incomes below the poverty level. Marital Stability McCarthy and Menken (1979) analyzed data from more than 7,000 women in the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth. They looked at Black women and white women who were either 20 years and older at first birth or under 20. Most teens in both groups were married within two years of the first birth. About 68 percent of the teen par- ents reported marrying within nine months of conception, while 81 percent of the 20 year and older respondents married in this period. The likelihood of marriage varied significantly along ethnic lines. Whites were much more likely to marry prior to the child's birth than were Blacks. Among post-birth marriages, marriage within the three years after the child's birth was much more likely for white teens than for either white adults, Black teens, or Black adults. The high unemployment rate among young Black males, the high numbers of incarcerated Blacks, and the large number of Blacks killed in Viet- nam may make marriage less of an op- tion for Black women. Furstenberg (1976) found that the single most potent predictor of marital success among the teen parents was the economic viability of the male. The probability that marriages would dis- solve was significantly lower in those unions in which the male was a high school graduate and/or was a skilled worker, as compared to those in which he had not completed high school and was an unskilled laborer. Marital stabil- ity was greater in those families where men improved their economic status. Unlike the previous study where age appeared to be positively related to marital stability, Furstenberg found age was unrelated. He suggested that for Blacks, age alone does not improve employability or economic success (and thus account for greater marital stabil- ity). Economic viability of males may explain McCarthy and Menken's (1979) other major findings: Marriages among teens have high dissolution rates (these rates are higher for Blacks); and white teens are more likely to remarry than are Blacks. 50 Young Children</page><page sequence="5">Subsequent Childbearing Teen mothers have slightly higher fertility rates than do adult mothers even when age at first birth is con- trolled. Moore's data (1978) on women who were between 35 and 52 years of age revealed that those who were 17 or younger at first birth had about five children while those age 20 years or older had approximately three children per family. The fertility rate decreased as mother's age increased. This relation- ship was stronger for Blacks than for whites. Furstenberg's data also support in- creased fecundity among adolescents who became parents. At the last fol- lowup, teen parents had both more preg- nancies (2.11) and more children (1.66) than did their classmates (1.00 and .69 respectively). Single adolescents gave birth to a second child more quickly than did single control group classmates. No differences in the timing of the second pregnancy were observed between the very young adolescent par- ents and their married classmates. Trussell and Menken (1978) found that women who were age 15 to 17 at first birth had 36 percent more later- born children than did women age 20 to 24 years. When Blacks and whites are equated for age at first birth, differences in fertility disappeared. Prior to 1965 the pace of childbearing was greater for Blacks than for whites, but this has been reversed (Trussell and Menken 1978). Parenting and Children's Development More infants of teenagers begin their lives at risk than do those of adults; greater incidence of low birth weight, of infant morbidity, of mental retardation, and of birth defects has been found among teenagers' infants (Venturo 1977; Niswander and Gordon 1972). Yet the evidence about the long-term develop- mental consequences is contradictory. In a study of Black women, Field (1979) has reported some behavioral differences between teen and adult parents and between their offspring in the early months of life. Longer labor and more obstetric complications were observed for teenage mothers than for adults. This was particularly true for teen mothers having preterm infants. Few of the variables examined (obstetric, be- havioral, anthropomorphic, and at- titudinal) significantly differentiated adult from teen parents or their chil- dren. Teenage mothers of term babies expected their infants to attain certain developmental milestones later than did adult mothers. However, teen mothers of preterm infants expected these milestones would appear much earlier, and their general childrearing attitude was more punitive. At four months of age, babies of teenagers weighed less and were short- er. The mothers' perception of infants' temperament differed significantly. In- fants of teens were rated less optimally by parents in their adaptability, ap- proach to stimuli, distractibility, and level of activity. Face-to-face interactions of mother and infant were observed to be less optimal among teens. Teenage mothers who participated in a parent education intervention program manifested more optimal interactive be- havior than parents not in the program. Infants were developmentally more ad- vanced on the Denver Developmental Screening Test. Their mothers had more accurate developmental expectations and rated their infants as having more desir- able temperaments. Similar differences in favor of the intervention group were observed again at 8 months of age (Field, Wilmayer, Stringer, and Ignatoff 1979). Others have also reported that teenage parents' expectations for their children's development are not accurate ones. Epstein (1978) reported that, among Black teen mothers, late developmental January 1980 51</page><page sequence="6">expectations were negatively related to awareness of the developmental signifi- cance of observed child behavior and parent-child interactions. For more than three years, DeLissovoy (1973) inter- viewed and observed a group of mar- ried white teen parents from a rural working class background. He reported both mothers and fathers had early ex- pectations for normative behaviors. They were described as insensitive to, as well as intolerant of and impatient with, their infants. In contrast, Dryfoos and Bellmont (1978) reported the absence of consistent data indicating an association between poor social-emotional development and teenage parenting. However, they have reported small but positive relationships between maternal age and children's intellectual development among Blacks, but not among whites. Children of Black teenagers performed slightly less well on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Chil- dren. Maracek (1979) reported similar results with a largely Black sample. She exam- ined intellectual functioning and social development among the children of teen and adult mothers at 8 months of age, at 4 years, and again at 7. At 8 months no differences in motor development were found; small but significant differ- ences due to age of mothers were found in mental development. Some differ- ences were detected in spontaneous play, exploratory behavior, and social responsiveness in favor of children of the older mothers. At age 4, group dif- ferences in Stanford-Binet performance were not significant. At age 7, children of adolescent mothers scored an average of 2 Verbal IQ points and 5 Performance IQ points below the children of adults. Boys evidenced a larger difference than girls. There were also differences in school achievement. Children of adoles- cent parents were three times more likely to fail first grade. And at age 7, 12 percent of the adolescent mothers re- ported learning difficulties among sons, versus 4 percent of the older mothers. However, no information about com- parability of the Black adult and teen groups in terms of income or family structure was reported. Should such differences be present, they may explain some of the above findings. Ratings of children's social behavior by project staff at ages 4 and 7 suggested greater maladaptive behavior among the off- spring of adolescents, especially among boys. The Major Consequences of Early Childbearing Education Both teenage mothers and fathers, but especially moth- ers, complete fewer years of school. Income The incomes of teenage moth- ers are lower than those of mothers who delay child- bearing. The incomes of teenage fathers may differ little from those who father children later in life. Marriage Most teenage mothers whether Black or white marry within a few years of their first birth. These marriages are more likely to dissolve than are those among adults. The economic viability of the male was a strong predictor of marital success among Blacks. Subsequent Women who begin their child- childbearing bearing careers early have more children than those de- laying their first birth. Children's Consistent and substantial development differences in intellectual and personal-social function- ing of the children of teenage parents and those of adults have not yet been confirmed. Some evidence has sug- gested earlier marriage, earlier childbearing, and larger families for the chil- dren of teenage parents. Family support Support from the extended family enables the single teen mother to complete school and become economically independent. 52 Young Children</page><page sequence="7">Furstenberg (1976) found that maternal age at first birth was unrelated to five- year- old children's performance on the Caldwell Preschool Inventory. Measures of children's ability to defer gratifica- tion, of efficacy, of trust, and of self- esteem revealed no differences between the children of younger teens and of their classmates' children. Card (1978) examined the long-term consequences of adolescent parentage for cognitive functioning and for per- sonality development. When background characteristics of race, socioeconomic status, and birth order were controlled, initially significant (but small) differ- ences in both cognition and personal- social behavior in favor of the children of non-teenage parents disappeared. Being reared by a teenage parent was unrelated to the cognitive and personal- ity development of offspring in adoles- cence. Note that the offspring of adoles- cents in father-mother households had higher academic aptitudes; those in parent/step-parent families were the next highest; next were the single-parent children and last the children in house- holds headed by adults other than the parent. Card also reported that the chil- dren of adolescent parents were more likely to marry early, have children early, and have more children. Family Help The transition to parenthood for many boys and girls is a heavy burden, espe- cially for the young single girl. She is most likely to experience educational setbacks and obtain marginal income. Initiating motherhood early in life may result in parenting as a career choice which results in slightly larger families. Marriage, especially to one who com- pleted high school and was stably employed, diminished the negative eco- nomic consequences (Furstenberg and Crawford 1978). Support and help from the family of origin substantially reduced the possible detrimental effects of early parenthood. Single teenage mothers who continued to live with their family of origin were more likely to return to school, grad- uate, and secure jobs, and were less likely to end up on welfare. Conversely, single teen women who moved out of the family home more frequently per- manently dropped out of school. More were unemployed and on welfare. Single parenthood and an out-of- wedlock pregnancy may not doom a young female to poverty and welfare, especially when the extended family provides help and support. Such help from the family network is especially forthcoming in Black families (Fursten- berg 1976), though this is also likely to occur within other ethnic and social groups, especially Hispanics and white ethnics. Implications Early parenthood makes optimal child- rearing substantially more difficult. Teenage families are less likely than older parents to be able to support the optimal development of their children, especially in the child's early years. There are, however, teenagers who are skillful parents. What then are the im- plications of these data for services to teenagers? First, for primary prevention, educa- tional programs about sex, conception, contraception, and parenthood are es- sential for teens and their parents. Ef- fective education for parenthood courses in junior and senior high schools prob- ably are potent preventive measures. Community- based media campaigns such as television and radio spots may be another. Yet if present trends con- tinue unchecked, Tietze (1979) has esti- mated that 34-39 percent of all of today's 14-year-old girls will have at least one January 1980 53</page><page sequence="8">pregnancy before age 20. Twenty per- cent will give birth; 15 percent will ob- tain an abortion; and 6 percent will have a stillbirth or a miscarriage. How- ever, if all adolescents became consistent users of contraceptives rather than occa- sional users, the number of premarital pregnancies could be reduced by an- other 40 percent (Zelnick and Kanter 1978). Next, for secondary prevention, sup- port programs for teenage parents should be established. Continuation of schooling, particularly completion of high school, is directly related to employability and income - especially for women. Schools will need to plan with the pregnant teenager and her family for the completion of schooling. While programs designed to support teenage parents in returning to school may be more successful with teenagers who are highly ambitious educationally and those having family support for continued schooling, other teenagers also must be targeted for help. Feasible and realistic combinations of vocational education, academic coursework, and parenting education, reflective of the mother's and the father's abilities and interests, will have to be developed. This may suggest expansion of work- study programs developed by the school and local industry. Inexpensive, convenient, and effective child care services will need to be de- veloped. Secondary schools may be ap- propriate sites. Schools can facilitate the development of child care systems pro- viding center care, family day care, or outreach training programs for the rela- tive who cares for the child in the home. Such services will need to avoid disrupting and displacing the child care services provided by the teenager's ex- tended family. For many families this care will be preferable. Instead, early educators can work to complement and strengthen the work of these parent sur- rogates. For teenagers choosing center or family day care, these child care workers will need to develop a willingness to communicate with and involve all those with major responsibility for the child's care in the home: grandparent, mother, father, aunt, uncle, or great-grandparent. Comprehensive service programs for teens can no longer target just the mother and include only discussion of the mother-child relationship. Further, where appropriate, programs can sup- port and strengthen the older adult and teen-parent relationship so that it be- comes a mutually supportive and growth-fostering one. The program can help the teen maintain, build, and con- structively utilize a network of helping relationships with a variety of signifi- cant others. In addition to the father, this may include both the mother's and the father's families of origin. If the skill, knowledge, and resources of the members of the teenager's social net- work can be enhanced, it is likely that the child's development will be strengthened. The content of the parent education component of a comprehensive service program for teenage parents is critical. Important objectives are the develop- ment of realistic behavioral expectations for children, as well as sensitive, recip- rocal patterns of adult-child interaction. It may be that group training programs for adolescent parents that use other teen parents as peers may be more ef- fective than individual consultation pro- grams alone. Parent education programs for teenagers enhance parents' behavior and children's development (Field, et al. 1979; Badger, Elsass and Sutherland 1974). The U.S. Office of Adolescent Preg- nancy has mounted a national effort in secondary prevention. Recently, Con- gress enacted Titles VI, VII, and VIII of the Health Services and Center Amend- ment Act to fund comprehensive com- munity service programs for teenage parents. These programs must furnish 54 Young Children</page><page sequence="9">an array of "core" or direct services and of "supplementary" or coordinated ser- vices including: pregnancy testing and maternity counseling; family planning; primary and preventive health/nutrition services; sex and family life education; educational vocational counseling/ training; and child care. A few pro- grams were funded in the fall of 1979. Whether this federal program is ex- panded with additional appropriations, as expected, will soon be evident. The increase in births to very young teenagers is a sobering challenge to early educators. One important contri- bution we can make is to design and implement appropriate child care ser- vices and parent education programs. Yet to establish the array of comprehen- sive services which are needed by teen- age families demands that we work collaboratively with a variety of institu- tions and professionals.
