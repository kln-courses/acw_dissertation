<plain_text><page sequence="1">"BUTCHER DIALOGUES": THE HANGING CARCASS IN MODERN JEWISH ART AVIGDOR W. G. POS£Q The Jewishness of Jewish art is usually defined by the fact that it is made by a Jewish artist and by its content. The attempt to identify Jewish style as an expressionistic idiom based on the work of the Jewish Ecole de Paris, particularly Soutine, is no longer acceptable. Nevertheless, modern Jewish artists' perchant for tragic subjects may be illustrated by the motif of the hanging carcass not only in Soutine and Chagall, but also in the work of other contemporaries such as Haim Atar, George Segal and Tumarkin. Moreover, this motif is often endowed with symbolic meanings that may be traced to ancient Hebrew rites - in evoking offerings, the butchered animals refer not only to biblical oblations but perhaps also to the human sacrifices to Moloch which were replaced by animals in the Temple liturgy (De Vaux, 52ff.; Weinfeld). The Hebrew word for sacrifice (qorban), deriving from the root qarev which means to bring together, or to unite, suggests that the votive tributes also fostered the unity of the faithful, especially characteristic of the collective sin-offering of a young bull on the Day of Atonement (qorban hata'at) (Lev. 16:14-15). Though that ritual was eventually replaced by prayer, the concept of the expiatory offering continued to haunt later generations in the dogma of humanity's redemption by Christ's self-sacrifice. Jewish mystics also dwelled on the propitiatory meaning of sacrifices, but, arguing that God receives only the offerer's religious intention, they claimed that the animals' flesh was meant to placate the Evil Power (sitra ahra) while it was being driven away from the mystical union between Israel and God (Rainey, Scholem, 141f.; Tishby, 194ff.). However, neither the esoteric nor other interpretations of the sacrifices are reflected in ancient Jewish art, which with the notable exception of "Abraham's Offering", seldom portrayed sacrificial rites. It is therefore especially remarkable that this theme has attracted modern Jewish artists, who have not only conceived the butchered animal as a metaphor of collective penitence but also, in conformity with the Hebrew ritual which required that the sacrificer identify with his offering, have often endowed the flayed animal with a special personal meaning. In discussing these images we shall not proceed chronologicaly, but starting with the frequently recurring carcasses 77</page><page sequence="2">AVIGDOR W. G. POS6Q in the work of Igael Tumarkin we shall trace a concise survey of their iconographical history. In the course of an especially productive period in the late sixties Tumarkin developed a hybrid technique, combining organic forms cast from nature with geometrical structures. Several of his compositions were overtly autobiographical (Poseq, a,b,c) while others were conceived as symbolic tributes to Old Masters and to modern artists in whom Tumarkin recognized his spiritual mentors. Three of these assemblages featuring animal casts were depicted in a preparatory watercolour sketch which may act as an introduction to Tumarkin's other versions of the motif. The watercolour shows three votive monuments whose dedicatory intent is indicated by inscriptions [Fig. 1] (Tumarkin a: 131). On the left is a rectangular case containing a skeletal animal denominated as a tribute to the contemporary English painter Francis Bacon. The second shrine, dedicated to Chaim Soutine, contains two anguished masks of which one is extended into an animal limb, and a hand which defines the assemblage as a memorial, in Hebrew yad, literally "hand". The third shrine, again rectangular in shape, featuring a similar hand, and a hanging animal, is called Hommage ä Rembrandt. The general theme of the composition is indicated by a cursive Hebrew inscription which, somewhat facetiously, calls it a Butchers' Dialogue Triptych. The "butchers" may be identified as the artists by whom Tumarkin was most deeply influenced, while their "dialogue" refers to the iconographic tradition of the butchered animal motif - the consecutive numbers imply Bacon's relationship to Soutine and Soutine's to Rembrandt. Tumarkin also drew another sketch of the three shrines [Fig. 2] (Tumarkin a:124), again identified by tituli, none of which however, corresponds to those in the watercolour. The tribute to Bacon moves to the right from its original position on the left, while the construction originally dedicated to Rembrandt is now called Hommage ä Soutine. The triangular shrine in the centre is rededicated to Rembrandt, stressing his primacy. In the ensuing sculpture, also called Hommage ä Rembrandt [Fig. 3] (Tumarkin, b:83) Tumarkin added to the flayed animal two masks resembling figures in Rembrandt's Anatomy Lesson (Rosenberg, 132) implying Rembrandt's role as the master who taught an important lesson to the other participants in the "dialogue". The specific Rembrandt painting which ispired the modern artists is a famous work in the Louvre, showing a butcher shop interior with a flayed ox [Fig. 4] (Rosenberg, 265). The shop which may originally have been sketched in situ (Haak, 252, fig. 241) represents a type of low-life scene introduced a century earlier by the Dutch Mannerists (Bergstrom, 248-50; Haak, figs 419,420), as in Pieter Aertsen's Butcher's Shop, where the deeper recesses of the slaughterhouse allow a glimpse of a suspended carcass [Fig. 5] (Bergstrom, 16-19). The 78</page><page sequence="3">THE HANGING CARCASS IN MODERN JEWISH ART relation between Aertsen's rich display of meat and poultry and the "Flight into Egypt" also included in the composition, may allude to the Low Countries as a "land of plenty", a haven for persecuted refugees. The Dutch still-life genre was emulated by the Italians who may have associated the slaughterhouse theme with similar representations sometimes found in Roman art, for instance a sarcophagus relief showing a female butcher illustrated in a seventeenth century catalogue of antiquities [Fig. 6] (Cat. Galleria Giustiniana, 112). The combined influence of this prototype and of the popular Dutch genre is reflected in Annibale Carracci's depiction of an Italian butcher's bottega [Fig. 7] (Cooney X Malafarina, 86:7, no. 4; Posner, 1:12, 11:3). Since in Italian "bottega" means both a shop and an artist's workshop, while the term for raw meat (carne viva) also means "living flesh", the Carracci painting showing that the aesthetic appeal of a work of art need not be identical with the conventional attractiveness of its subject, has been discussed as an attempt to infuse new life into the Mannerist style (Martin, 263; Dempsey, 111). Rembrandt's slaughtered ox provides an even more dramatic illustration of this concept (Gerson, 374). The mystic lighting evoking Rembrandt's religious themes, bestows great dignity on the butchered animal, so that the painting may be understood as a metaphor of sacramental propitiation, in which the flayed beast takes the place of the crucified Christ. The spiritual meaning of the Louvre painting was perceived by Honors Daumier who referred to it in a watercolour representing a Paris slaughterhouse, where the pose of the butcher and the crossed sticks of the meat-hanger recall the "Elevation of the Cross" [Fig. 8] (Maison, 11:89; Vincent, 92). Igael Tumarkin followed this example in an assemblage featuring a mask cast from his own face, and an animal hanging on a cross which recalls Grunewald's Crucifixion, [Fig. 9] (Tumarkin a: 134). As the work of an Israeli artist who was born in Germany in 1933, this crucifix symbolizes the martyrdom of the Jewish people, but the mask also implies Tumarkun's own suffering as a Jew (Poseq, b: 294; c: 57). Rembrandt's Ox also haunted Soutine. This artist made the flayed animal into a personal allegory of his inner anguish, to which he returned compulsively in a series of canvasses [Fig. 10] (Werner, 122). To reinforce his impression of the Louvre painting he obtained a real bloody carcass in the neighbouring market and when the expense of additional carcasses proved prohibitive, he painted a dead dog, a skinned hare and even a plucked chicken [Fig. 11] (M. Tuchman, 52; Dunow, 83). Although these paintings were completed several years before the Second World War, Soutine's recurring interest in the macabre was later interpreted as a premonition of the Holocaust. The animal carcasses deeply moved other Jewish artists who, anticipating Tumarkin, entered into a kind of "dialogue" not only with Soutine but also with Rembrandt. One of them was Marc Chagall whose homage to the Dutch master, painted in the twenties under Soutine's influence, became an affectionate souvenir of Chagall's friendship with Soutine. 79</page><page sequence="4">AVIGDOR W. G. POStQ In a painting of 1929 Chagall suspended the flayed ox aganist the panorama of his native Vitebsk [Fig. 12] (Estienne, 48) and in the same year he also painted a Vitebsk slaughterhouse interior with an Orthodox Jewish butcher (Mayer, cat. 525). Almost twenty years later, when the enormity of the Holocaust became known, Chagall again painted a gigantic carcass (of a cow?) hanging head downward [Fig. 13] (Haftmann, 132; Meyer, 480-484). The blood dripping into a pail set under the carcass reminds one of the Jewish injunction against spilling blood on the ground, while the fact that the flayed animal seems to drink its own blood suggests that it is participating in its own sacrifice. The scene is set in a shtetl. over which, like Michelangelo's "Creator" in the Sistine Chapel, hovers a bearded Jewish butcher. Considering that Chagall usually avoided depicting an anthropomorphic deity (Friedman, 262), the hovering butcher may perhaps be seen as the Angel of Death, or rather as a wrathful personification of Jewish destiny demanding sacrificial offerings. The allegory of the collective Jewish tragedy had an enduring impact on an Israeli pioneer artist, the painter Haim Atar (Aptekar) who was deeply committed to the promotion of an authentic Jewish art, which, he thought, should combine the tradition of the Jewish Ecole de Paris with that of the Old Masters (Atar, in: Efron, 104-5). Having been lastingly influenced by Soutine during a visit to Paris in 1933, and later also in 1937, Atar evolved a personal idiom that may serve as an illustration of the Jewish expressionist tendency in painting. His debt to Soutine is also reflected in his iconographic repertory, including several versions of skinned birds [Fig. 14] (Efron, Figs. 56 and 57). His Slaughtered Ox, a posthumous homage to Soutine, is also a tribute to the premonitory content of Soutine's message [Fig. 15] (Efron, fig. 60). Tumarkin, who had probably become familiar with Atar's work in Israel before he had an opportunity to study Soutine's originals, was also deeply impressed by Soutine's tragic carcasses. In the Butchers' Dialogue he pays tribute to Soutine's debt to the Dutch master but in his sculptural Hommage ä Soutine [Fig. 16] (Tumarkin, c) he combines the cast of a real animal (a dog?) with an iron wheel that may be seen as a symbol of Soutine's torment or perhaps as a "wheel of fortune", alluding to Soutine's posthumous glory. If one recognizes in the slaughtered animal a symbol of Jewish martyrdom the wheel may also allude to Jewish destiny. The other modern artist included in Tumarkin's Butchers' Dialogue is Francis Bacon, and again the tribute takes the form of a slaughtered animal [Fig. 17] (Tumarkin, c). In Tumarkin's watercolour sketch the "Hommage ä Bacon" features a skeletal ox, which recalls Atar's painting of the same subject, but the sculpture refers to the complex allegorical meaning which the Irish born English painter assigned to 80</page><page sequence="5">THE HANGING CARCASS IN MODERN JEWISH ART the motif. Bacon himself declared that having been attracted to slaughterhouses and meat since his youth, he instinctively associated animal carcasses with the Crucifixion, which later, as a non-believer, he conceived as an act of inhuman cruelty (Sylvester, 22-24). Perhaps the most significant of the numerous paintings which Bacon dedicated to this theme is a Figure with Sides of Beef, dated 1954 [Fig. 18] (Ades, 18, no. 25). The clerical personage sitting under a split animal corpse forming a kind of Gothic canopy, was adapted from Velazquez's portrait of Pope Innocence X, implying that the bloody carcass symbolizes fanatic religious persecution. The Pope is set in a transparent cubicle, which though painted several years before the Eichmann trial in 1966, curiously resembles the glass cubicle in which the accused attended his trial (Sylvester, 22). In Tumarkin's sculptural Hommage ä Bacon composed a year after the Eichmann trial, the cubicle is evoked by the rectangular shape of the shrine. The carcass became a symbol of the Holocaust while the Pope, transformed into a screaming woman, warns humanity against the recurrence of barbarity. The macabre connotations of the animal carcasses also touched the American Jewish sculptor George Segal, who may have been impressed by Bacon's work even before he became aware of its antecedents in Rembrandt and Soutine. Identifying the motif's meaning, he evoked it in a cast from life human body hanging head downwards in a statuary group titled Execution [Fig. 19] (Van der Marek, 86; P. Tuchman, 61). In recalling the plaster figures cast from the hollow imprints of the victims of the destruction of Pompei [Fig. 19] (Zeri, frontispiece), Segal's Execution conveys the idea that human cruelty is no less destructive than the powers of nature. Though this protest aganist man's brutality to man may have referred to racial persecution in America, the hanging corpse evoking the martyrdom of Saint Peter, who was crucified head downward, may be seen as a more generic metaphor of violent aggression. The slaughtered animal assumed a more explicitly Jewish meaning in Segal's Butcher Shop, marked in Hebrew as "kosher", where the woman butcher represents Segal's mother who ran the Bronx family business alone after her husband's death (Fig. 21] (Van der Marek, 49; P. Tuchman, p. lOf.). The meat and poultry displayed in the shop window seem to have been taken out of a Soutine painting, while the scene as a whole reminds one not only of Pieter Aertsen's and Carracci's butcher shops, but also of the female butcher on the antique Roman sarcophagus [Fig. 6]. Speaking about his work Segal said that in being a memorial to his father, the "kosher" meat shop alludes to the Orthodox Jewish tradition, which "in obedience to God's laws drenches even prosaic acts of daily life with inordinate weight" (Tuchman, 10). Thus in a wider perspective the autobiographical Butcher Shop is also a testimonial to the American Jewish community's struggle to preserve its moral identity in the modern "land of plenty". 81</page><page sequence="6">AVIGDOR W. G. POS6Q Returning now to Tumarkin who has also adopted the technique of casting from nature, we may introduce more examples of his use of this tragic motif in a series of symbolic portal-like structures (Tumarkin, a:123-5). One of these, commemorating Soutine by a dead animal suspended by chains, may refer to the Heavenly Gate which in the Jewish tradition is reserved for the righteous [Fig. 22], The second portal, showing a split carcass hanging over a female dummy, is titled Notre Dame des Bouchers [Fig. 23]. In evoking the title of Jean Genet's autobiographical novel Notre Dame des Fleurs this sculpture associates the fate of the outcast artist with that of the persecuted Jew. Even more interesting is the third work in this series, called Astrobutcher, where the familiar carcass is combined with spheric cosmonaut's helmet containing a mask cast from Tumarkin's own face and a human hand which defines it as a memorial [Fig. 24) (Tumarkin, a:131). The symbolic meaning of this composition is explicated by a sketch [Fig. 25] (Tumarkin, a: 124), in which the helmet is marked by an acrostic of God's Name (YHWE) evoking the legendary Golem of Prague who bore on his forehead the secret name of the Lord (Scholem, 335ff.). The letters may allude to the astronaut's superhuman achievements, but they may also be seen as the mark of a mystic agency, which like the ancient Moloch demands human offerings even today. By placing his own effigy in the helmet Tumarkin fused the personal with the collective symbolism, associating himself not only with space pioneers who pay the price of their daring, but also with the caracass symbolizing Jewish martyrdom. Summing up this brief iconological compendium we may observe that in modern art the animal carcass has been given two kinds of meanings: it is used as an allegory of the creative individual's fate and as an emblem of inhumanity. The motif neither originated in Jewish art nor was restricted to Jewish artists, but only they reconciled the two different aspects of its significance and in a continuous "butchers' dialogue" with non-Jewish painters, they forged a distinctive iconographic tradition which in its relationship to the Jewish cultural legacy suggests a certain unity. Though the gruesome images are not consistent in style, in combining the personal and the collective experience they are not only like animal offerings, but also like prayers, which in replacing bloody sacrifices foster spirituality.
