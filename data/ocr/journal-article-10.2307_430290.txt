<plain_text><page sequence="1">ISIDORE OKPEWHO Principles of Traditional African Art I THE STUDY of traditional African art has usually been done by anthropologists, who have in more recent times been joined by art historians. Often, their work has not gone beyond the identification of art ob- jects by regions of origin or distribution; furthermore, they have made rather inade- quate attempts to deduce a community's life and thought from the nature and con- tent of its art. The effort has seldom been made to get to the roots of the aesthetic principles on which the art has been exe- cuted, and the result of this failure has generally been to devise blanket theories which have an exotic appeal but which are incapable of giving us an insight into the fundamental creative spirit that brought such art to be. Examples of this tendency abound. For instance, the prevailing view of traditional African art seems to be that it is executed on the prompting and in the service of ritual1 - a view which has made it difficult to see the artist as other than a slave to ritual. There is considerable evidence to the contrary. The proliferation of secular art among the Baule of the Ivory Coast, as well as the long tradition of decorative designs on Nigerian pottery (to name only a few cases), clearly indicate that quite often beauty is cultivated for its own appeal, not necessarily coerced into reli- gious service. The same is true for the ISIDORE OKPEWHO teaches oral literature in the department of English at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. oral arts. The moonlit square has for count- less generations been the setting for songs and stories whose primary intent is enter- tainment more, it would seem, than edi- fication. A large number of proverbs and quips survive today, and in many of them the outstanding feature is more the style than the content: they impress us more for their technical appeal than as fossils of a complex world-view. Those who look for religion or world- view behind everything in traditional art have often ignored the basic play interest of the artist. Thus in nearly every study of traditional African art, nothing whatsoever is said about the numerous pieces of phallic or erotic sculpture that can be found in many African villages which have a lively tradition of plastic art. Where mention is made of such pieces, there is usually an effort to connect them with rites of initia- tion or of fertility, which are happily treated as "religious." Nor, in the countless anthologies with which the market of Afri- can folklore is glutted, do we find very much by way of ribald verse; yet ask any youth in a typical African village to recite you his favorite verses, and the chances are the majority of them have to do with sex. An even more illuminating fact is that, in some of the more popular African tales which have anything to do with traditional religion, the religious element is frequently superseded by the play interest of the narra- tor, especially in the fervid context of the open performance. A useful illustration of this interest is provided by The Mwindo Epic.2 In fact, this tale gives considerable</page><page sequence="2">O K P E W H O support to the scepticism of those who have held that there is little connection between myth and religion (or even what Emile Durkheim has called the "collective con- science"). Mwindo's pursuit of his errant father takes him mostly through the under- world regions, and the quest is obstructed by two hostile divinities, Muisa and She- burungu; the latter of these, as the editors of the epic tell us, is "one of the epithets under which the supreme divinity of fire, Nyamurairi, is known." 3 These are no in- consequential figures of a vague pantheon, but deities accompanied by the full appur- tenances of worship. They are grouped along with other gods in the Nyanga cult system, and of them we are told: All these divinities, together with the ancestors, are known untler the generic term bashumbu. Shrines are marle and plantains are grown for them, women are diedicaterd and married to them, sheep and hunting dogs are consecrated to them, prayers are said to them, and distinc- tive cultural paraphernalia for each of them are kept by their adepts. They manifest them- selves in dreams and oracles and are responsible for good and evil in Nyanga life.4 Thus among the Nyanga, at least, it would be considered preposterous for anyone (un- less he was himself a divinity, and Mwindo is not a divinity) to be portrayed as con- tending against and overcoming the gods of the traditional pantheon. But Mwindo gets into a severe physical confrontation with Muisa. In the first round, Muisa levels Mwindo with his magic belt (karemba). Mwindo recovers, and with the aid of his own magic conga-scepter, smashes Muisa to the ground. With Sheburungu there is only a battle of wits-the wiki game. The god wins against Mwindo; but the hero, finding that ordinary human wits are of no use against a divinity, throws his magic conga-scepter into the bargain and wins. For a human character to fight and win against a divinity is, we must agree, con- trary to the spirit in which a society's reli- gious life is conducted. Even when Mwindo is translated into the sky by the lightning- god Nkuba and warned against further heroic excesses, the warning is unconnected with his fights and victories against Muisa and Sheburungu, particularly as Nkuba himself had helped Mwindo part of the way in those confrontations. Again, let us look closely at Nkuba's conduct in this connec- tion. Early in the story he takes sides with the enemies of Mwindo, but the hero always wins. Then Nkuba turns and becomes an ally of the hero in his struggles with some of his other enemies including Muisa and Sheburungu. But the final confrontation with Nkuba comes when Mwindo kills a dragon which is sacred to Nkuba, and con- sequently incurs the anger of his erstwhile ally. Though the denouement of the story seems to portray the hero as an overreacher, it is evident that the case for this rests only on his offense against Nkuba, and does not at all include his earlier acts of ostensible "impiety." The explanation offered by the editors, that "there was an excuse for the hero as long as he was the victim of his father's unjust decisions and actions," 5 is inadequate. Sheburungu, over whom the hero had earlier triumphed, is, as the same editors tell us,6 the supreme creator-god as well as god of fire; and there is really noth- ing in the tale or in the editorial notes that puts Nkuba in a superior position to She- burungu in the Nyanga cult system. The implications are quite obvious, par- ticularly if we take into consideration, as we should, the lively context of the heroic song. In the live, bubbling atmosphere wherein the Mwindo has been performed, what was normally a matter of serious con- cern for the community has become subject to the play instincts of the artist. We may not go so far as Levi-Strauss in maintaining that "myths operate in men's minds with- out their being aware of the fact"; 7 for those obtrusive "religious" details and strophic comments which punctuate the song argue a certain presence of mind. But it is quite clear that, in this mythopoeic context, both the bard and his audience have been drawn into an experience not altogether germane to the spirit of worship or ritual. The figures of the cult belief have been subjected to patterns of behavior which tend sometimes to detract from the awe in which they are traditionally held, especially in a tale like Mwindo whose 302</page><page sequence="3">Principles of Traditional African Art dramatic resources are evidently as much comical as serious. An audience treated to such a song will in no way consider its pious instincts offended by the bard's strange pic- ture, particularly when they reflect that the human beings with whom the gods are fabled to be contending are not exactly like their next-door neighbors. True, in their theological beliefs they know that the gods are responsible for evil as well as good, and indeed the whimsical nature of the gods which is revealed by these songs may well mirror some of their convictions. But they are unaccustomed, in their sober theologi- cal thinking, to conceive of divinity in the peculiar dramatic circumstances in which the myth-maker puts it, and are well con- tent to grant a heart-warming evening's performance the benefit of its strange con- tent and outlook. Clearly in such a situa- tion, the artistic play-drive has got the better of the religious instinct. II An understanding of traditional African art will depend, to some extent, on what we think is the traditional African world-view. We may safely avoid those fanciful terms which theorists on this subject have con- stantly bandied about,8 and instead take a close look at what traditional African man has done. The old "Bushman" of the south finally devised a way of mastering his environ- ment: not content with his crude weapons, he drew realistic pictures of the animals on the walls of his rock dwelling so he could keep the animals constantly before his mind's eye. And it is known that to this day the "Bushman," who has been a little reluctant to take leave of his old ways, hunts the ostrich most effectively by tucking his frame into a stuffed effigy of the bird and penetrating the unsuspecting herd. In the area of religion, we find the same re- markable sense of the practical and the real. It makes little difference whether religion grew out of man's primary feeling of terror at the unknown or the overwhelm- ing presence, or whether he fell to his knees after he had failed to master his world by his artful ways.9 What seems reasonably 303 certain is that on the African continent, as men developed a systematic theology, they sought to bring their ideas as close to home as possible. They infused their pantheon with their own ancestors. Though they could not see the spirits with their physical eyes, they tried to portray them in the most vivid images. Tutelary spirits or genii were represented in the images of beings within their areas of authority. If, for instance, the same genius was seen to guard over man and the realms of his livelihood, the same totemic figure was employed to signify this composite weal10 - and that, under the cir- cumstances, was the nature of the spirit. The Supreme God they still could not re- duce to plastic terms, but they forced him within hurmlan reference with names and attributes taken from the human experi- ence: thus Mawunyo ("God is kind") of the Ewe, the Yoruba Olorun su or the Ibo Chi ejiela ("God, i.e., the sky, is overcast"), or the Urhobo Oghenerhuele ("God repairs"). In all, as E. B. Idowu puts it, "the world invisible is viewed, the world intangible touched, the world unknown known, and the world inapprehensible clutched." 11 The dynamic creative temper has always been the source of general aesthetic worth. Art came to the service of religion only after the craftsman had attained a credit- able sureness of hand; only then was he recognized as the repository of a certain amount of beauty and enlisted as a trustee of communal truth. Elsy Leuzinger is quite mistaken in saying, It must be emphasized once again that for the negro art serves first and foremost a religious purpose; he feels it would be presumptuous of him to fashion a sculpture in human form. It is only in the field of secular art, when render- ing heroes and godlike kings, that he grapples with a subject in an effort to reproduce its natural elements and proportions in a manner true to life.12 Here there seems to be a misunderstanding of the mimetic principle under which the traditional artist operates. Further, and much more importantly, Leuzinger fails to recognize that art has a primarily secular impulse. It is particularly significant that true art has hardly flourished in the hands</page><page sequence="4">OKPEWHO of medicine men or fetishists, as Leuzinger indeed concedes elsewhere.13 This is be- cause they have more religion than skill, and no amount of inspirational glow can kindle creative torches where nature has been grudging. But where there is due pro- gression from native talent through con- scious practice and apprenticeship, the re- sult is often art of a truly ennobling quality, the kind that would "inspirit" the clan- to use Arnold's fine word.l4 Only then is the union between private talent and public truth realized. In the monarchical societies of Africa, only the best of a highly competi- tive crowd attained to the royal patron- age; 15 for the rest, the unhappy majority, their works have been lost to history be- cause they crumbled with their makers' homesteads. Much the same pattern is noticeable in the oral arts. We need hardly mention that in traditional festivals, where bards com- pete against one another, the highest ac- claim is often reserved for the most accom- plished in delivery. What Babalola says of the career of the ijala artist is sufficiently illuminating. After it has been conceded that "every ijala artist is merely Ogun's mouthpiece," we are in the end left in no doubt that "the best ijala-chanter, at a social gathering where several master ijala artists perform in turn, is the one whose repertoire is the most extensive and accu- rate, the best balanced in themes . . . and the best chanted." 16 Religion and ritual are not unimportant in the evolution of African art. What is objectionable is the popular notion that religion is always the starting point. In those areas where art of a truly imaginative quality flourished in the environment of ritual, ritual was merely the culminating point of the creative will. The artist had previously been carving tools and ordering his homestead. The people liked what they saw, and thereafter enlisted the artist to arrest for them in a concrete and harmo- nized manner the myriad forms around which their daily life and thought revolved. There was first the private creative will, which was then harnessed to give concrete meaning to the sacred communal weal; art in fact brought ritual into being. In the verbal arts, the primacy of talent is attested to by observations like the following from Babalola: It is only those who have a natural flair for ijala-chanting who successfully go through their period of apprenticeship. Failures are not un- common among these apprentices. No ijala pupil-artist embarks on this course of training merely because he is ordered to do so by his father or mother or other superior. It is gen- erally assumed that compulsion will merely en- sure the failure of a pupil learning ijala-chant- ing. Over and over again the ijala artists inter- viewed by the author came out with the declaration . . . 'It was because I longed to be able to chant ijala beautifully that I voluntarily went to a master ijala-artist and requested him to take me on as a pupil.'1 To appreciate this concept of the primacy of talent, one must look beyond the all too fashionable distinction made between secu- lar art and religious art, for that seems the only way of reaching the springs of the traditional aesthetic impulse. If this rather evasive distinction can be transcended, we will have gone a long way in exploring how the traditional creative mind works, what- ever the context of its exercise. We will be able to tell who is a good artist and who is not, even among those who have put their art at the service of religion. We will recog- nize that beneath even the most intense sacral motive is an underlying sense of form, which hitherto has been too often ignored. The objection might be raised that the traditional African artist-divine feels no divisive stresses, that his art finds a happy gestation in his ritual and vice versa. But if we accept that there are degrees of aes- thetic merit in traditional art - and to my knowledge no one has shown that this merit bears any direct relation to the qual- ity of ritual - then perhaps we have to concede that there must be principles other than religious on which art depends for its just and proper growth.'8 If we do not, then we may be ignoring the fact that reli- gion itself, as a system of organized worship, with a pantheon and a hierarchy of figures neatly conceived, is a product of man's creative will. If we sincerely intend to enquire into 304</page><page sequence="5">Principles of Traditional African Art the aesthetic basis of traditional African art, then even an examination of several vaguely identical cult images from the past - since they bear no names, we can hardly establish their authorship whether individ- ual or collective-will yield us no small insight into the underlying creative ego beneath the perhaps obtrusive veneer of rite. I have in mind the kind of diligence that in Ife art has isolated "the master of the aquiline forms" from the rest of the kindred crowd. The student of the tradi- tional aesthetics must confess to being handicapped in his quest for valid inter- pretations when confronted with art that has survived from the past. His vision has been considerably dulled by time and the vagaries of experience. In the plastic arts, too much has been lost (not only to the elements but to the secrecy of shrines and the art thief's cupboard) that could have given us a fuller picture. In oral literature, the problem is perhaps even more complex. Some of the quite sensitive oral art is shrouded in the secrecy of the cult. Commenting on the initial problems of collecting Ife and Iwi verse, Wande Abim- bola reports that "unless a man is .. initiated into the secret societies that pos- sess these forms of literature, it may be diffi- cult or impossible for him to collect any- thing." 19 Part of the difficulty also derives from the very nature of the oral tradition. It is of course true that the traditional bard never had need of writing, but there is more to the issue than the apologists have cared to admit. Traditional oral literature is mostly performed, and performance is often rewarded with material gifts; many artists still live partly by their perform- ances. It therefore seems a fair guess that, if the lure of largesse was not such an over- whelming argument, we would be in far less want of documentation than we are today. III Let us examine briefly some of the dy- namic principles and atmosphere deter- mining the productivity of the working artist. To be sure, one cannot be exhaus- tive in this regard: not the least of our 305 limitations is the fact that we are too far removed from the roots of that art to make any pretentious claims. But we can, at least, reach some tentative conclusions. THE MIMETIC PRINCIPLE Much of what we might conjecture to be the creative outlook of the traditional Afri- can artist would ultimately depend on what we thought was his society's view of reality. Does reality exist out there in some kind of "circumambient air" (to borrow from Hulme), and does the artist place his crea- tive powers at the mercy of a formless in- finitude, an intangible world of abstrac- tions? Or does reality exist instead in the realm of human experience, whereby the artist could seek to explain the nature of the unknown and the supernatural? In view of what I have identified as the tradi- tional society's pressing sense of the real, the desire to have "the inapprehensible world grasped," it seems logical to suggest that it has human experience as its funda- mental frame of reference. For art this will mean that, though he accepts and respects a metaphysical order, the artist reduces the abstractions to recognizable form in due proportions. The traditional African artist is thus first and foremost a realist artist. But he operates on two levels of realism. The first level relates to objects of the visible, physical world treated in their just features and characteristics. Under this category can be brought much of the por- trait type of art such as Ife and Benin lavishly offer - kings, queens, and queen mothers, and so forth. Portrait art is also known elsewhere in Africa: among the Bakuba of Zaire and the Baule of the Ivory Coast,20 to name just a few cases. The ele- ment of direct realism in portrait art is employed in the representation of many aspects of experience. There are, for in- stance, the funeral heads among the Ashanti of Ghana. From Benin again we have sev- eral naturalistic portraits of horse soldiers, hunters and their animals, and the like.21 We need hardly emphasize the overwhelm- ing sense of realism that Benin and Ife reflect: the care taken over facial marks, beads and bangles by their numbers, the</page><page sequence="6">O K P EW H O insignia of office, coats of mail, stoles in their proper lengths, and so on. No meta- physical qualms here; just plain reality in its striking outlines. But the artist has a further level of real- ism for what has been called "the spirit- regarding order." Art critics have repeatedly and erroneously called this kind of art "abstract." But in this category of art, the traditional artist is addressing himself not to ideas as such, or abstractions, but to spirits and deities vividly conceived. The distinction is worth emphasizing, because abstraction properly belongs to an age that has lost considerable faith in the per- ceptible real - an age, as it were, of dis- belief. Those horrendous shapes that fea- ture in the folk myth and the plastic arts are as real as the forests and the sequestered shrines that they inhabit. The chi wara of the Bambara is not simply "fecundity" as an abstract idea; it was a spirit sent down by the Creator to promote fecundity. But, although you cannot accurately picture a spirit, the Bambara have too vivid a sense of the real to be lost in imprecisions. So they portray the chi wara in the stylized form of a denizen of the fecund environ- ment, the antelope, worn as a mask during their ritual dances. It would be mistaken to call a figure abstract simply because it combined selec- tive images in a composite form and was treated with some stylization. Those figures are vivid elements of a people's living myth. Allecto with serpents for her hair is not an abstract idea of fury; she is a Fury. The same applies to our ceremonial masks. They are the artist's vivid portrait of an ancestral or a genial presence - the figures, as Senghor tells us in his "Prayer to Masks," through whom the spirit breathes. But since the artist cannot claim exact knowl- edge of the outlines of a spirit's physiog- nomy, he endeavors to strike a just balance between his limitations and his sense of the real; those masks are a biomorphic response to the various forms and natures of the spirits concerned. It is remarkable how close those portraits of spirits can be. Mar- garet Trowell has made the following ob- servation on the Sakapu society in the Ijo country of southern Nigeria: The members performed a most elaborate sys- tem of plays in honour of the Owu or water spirits. After sacrifices, with feasting and danc- ing, the Owu are asked to colme forth from their home under the sea and to be present at the rites. The head-dresses are said to repre- sent the Owu when they were last seen.22 Surely, to label such an effort as "abstract" is to misunderstand the tremendous close- ness and empathy which the traditional artist feels towards his subject. Abstraction is a disengagement - Eliot has the right phrase in "dissociation of sensibility"- and the traditional artist puts hardly a distance between him and the vivid throng of pres- ences that he feels around him. "Abstract," it is true, is only a formal label; but used of traditional art it fails to take due account of the attitude that gave birth to such art.23 Something of this kind of realism is also observable in oral literature. On the one hand, there is the vivid, naturalistic por- trait of the animal world whose livelihood is so closely tied to that of man. This por- trait has a typically anthropomorphic touch to it, especially in the dialogues. But over- all, a remarkable pattern of verisimilitude is maintained. The clever tortoise overplays his hand, but has the last laugh on his captors anyway; he swears he loves nothing better than to be dropped in boiling oil, but wails that a cool stream would be the death of him. He is dropped into a cool stream, and escapes. The dog's habit of dillydallying on his way is given a tragic turn when he fails man on a mission of im- mortality. A misguided sense of kindness brings upon the billy-goat the fate originally intended for the tortoise. The catalog of such tales is endless. The subjects may be- long to a non-human realm, but they are treated with such interest and intimacy that the line of distinction virtually disappears. Man is also observed in his own integral circumstances, and his successes and failures are seen in terms of his courage or of his moral shortcomings. Stories of conflicts be- tween communities abound in this kind of portraiture. There are few metaphysical or 306</page><page sequence="7">Principles of Traditional African Art theological implications underlying the de- tails, simply an interest in man's grim con- frontation with his not-so-gracious fellows. Daniel Kunene bears witness to this cate- gory of realism in his study of the oral poetry relating to the legendary world of Moshoeshoe: The heroes are not superior beings except in so far as their earthly deeds make them so, least of all are they gods or descendants of gods. They do not possess supernatural powers, or do battle against other worldly creatures such as monsters and demons. They do not go on adventures to worlds beyond that of man. Nor are they wont to provide lavish feasts in pala- tial mansions. In short, they are ordinary hu- man beings engaged in ordinary human activi- ties. Not seldom, however, the poet, in the vivid- ness of his imagination, uses metaphor, imagery, and symbolism which transport these ordinary activities to a level of extraordinariness, and the hero is often described as fighting against mon- sters, or as being himself a monster or other terrible creature destroying his opponents. But this is never meant to be more than figurative.24 However, a good deal of the traditional literature of Africa - at least the bulk of it in which one might recognize a truly imagi- native touch - explores this very idea of "adventure to worlds beyond that of man." We do not need to linger here over the ease with which the artist conceives his setting and peoples it with all manner of shapes, nor the easy spatial links which he estab- lishes between the world of spirits and that of man. What has been said of the plastic arts holds true here: those myriad wraiths and trolls are as germane to the artist's sense of concrete presences as the thicket in the backyard. But perhaps the most sig- nificant aspect of the realism in this connec- tion is the tremendous empathy which the bard establishes between himself and the subjects of his tale, especially the hero. In the various epics, for instance, that one reads from diverse reaches of sub-Saharan Africa, one is struck by a pattern of narra- tion in which the pronouns seem happily confused. No doubt, for the bard the only way of coercing the supernatural world to an acceptable human reference is by a per- formance in which, according to Biebuyck and Mateene, "le chanteur s'associe intime- 307 ment avec son sujet et ses heros, a tel point, qu'il semble s'identifier a eux." 25 Rather unlike Homer, he immerses himself in the story with an enthusiasm which Plato would have condemned as ignoble frenzy. This device is particularly noticeable in The Mwindo Epic. The career of Mwindo takes place in a largely supernatural milieu; but from both the bard's identification with him and the rather careful epilogue to the story, we are made to feel as if we have a stake in the fortunes in the hero. This is no doubt realism at its most sublime. THE ECOLOGY OF ART "Hunter," said Gnankouman Doua (griot to Maghan Kon Fatta, Sundiata's father), "your words are obscure. Make your speech comprehensible to us, speak in the lan- guage of your savanna." 26 There is a subtle but discernible relation- ship between art and the landscape out of which it grows. If we can concede that the earliest art was a response to the immedi- ate pressures of man's living conditions- whether these pressures took the form of hunger, threat to life, or any other form - then it will become clear why the environ- ment would make any difference to the forms or the quality of art. And it would appear that a good deal of the aesthetic nourishment of traditional African art de- rived from the nature of the surrounding landscape and the concomitant throb of animate company within it. The griot of old Mali thus spoke well within aesthetic reason when he made a con- nection between the uncomplicated clarity of the native speech and the lean vegetation of the surrounding savanna. In a rather subtle way, the legends from the savanna country reflect this leanness. A good illus- tration of this point is the fact that, in these legends, the scope of heroic action is con- siderably limited. Consider the idea of the entry into the Otherworld. We find some- thing close to this notion in Sundiata, at that point where the hero pursues the van- quished Soumaoro until the latter disappears into a "black cavern" in Mount Koulikoro. There the pursuit ends, as Sundiata gapes</page><page sequence="8">O K P E W H O helplessly at the mouth of the cave. There seems much greater bravado in the forest country. We might safely conjecture that there Sundiata would have been made to carry the fight with Soumaoro into the underworld. There are hardly any re- straints on the hero of the forest country, as the extra-terrestrial exploits of Fagunwa's Akara-Ogun, Tutuola's Drinkard, and Rureke's Mwindo witness. There is also a correspondingly greater belief in life, in forest legends, than in those from the savanna country, as the Kambili epic27 and Sundiata indicate. One is struck by a certain haunting and elliptical effect to the whole narrative, an oppressive sense of loss, of decline, and of death. The same effect is noticeable in Northern Nigerian tales when compared with corresponding pieces from the south of the country. There are jinns and daemons, of course, but noth- ing to compare in extravagance, variety, and ebullience with the figures in, say, Yoruba mythology. In the main, the tales from the forest country tend to explore a victory over death as over its forces, and reflect the throb, lushness, and elan of the organic life and fellowship around them. It is perhaps no accident of detail that, whereas in Kambili the dominant senti- ment is that "all things that stand even- tually lie down," in Mwindo it is that "whatever sleeps shall wake." dIt may be said that the savanna regions I have referred to are places where Islam has succeeded considerably in suppressing the vigor of traditional life and myth (though Kambili here and there reveals a vigorous opposition to the Islamic faith). The Hunde, like the Nyanga, are Bantu- speaking, and were grouped by the Belgian authorities into administrative units similar to those of the Nyanga. But the Hunde live in savanna country, and with them the changes in language and myth have been rather unrewarding. Perhaps the principal reason for this is that the crea- tive imagination has not found the kind of organic environment which has been the signal blessing of the Nyanga of the neigh- boring rain forests. The forest country is a crowded region. The persistent rainfall gives rise to thick vegetation, the right habitat for the myriad wildlife in the region. The intervening spaces allow for dense population. Luxuri- ance of living things stimulates a corre- sponding luxuriance of communication; and mirth attends the teeming camaraderie. Where else but in a forest of merry ghosts could we find the mythical figures of Drum, Song, and Dance, as in Amos Tutuola's Palm Wine Drinkard? 28 We can trace a corresponding influence of ecology on traditional African plastic art. There is a certain elegance in the pro- portionally long and slender antelope fig- ures, masks, and even ancestral figures that dominate the art of the Bambara and the Dogon of the arid Western Sudan, and the landscape has much to do with these forms. The vegetation is thin and low, and the animal as well as human figures stand out in slender relief against the background of scanty bush. This is arguably the under- lying principle behind those long, lean horns and headwear; the stylization only heightens the effect. Indeed, there is little in the savanna flora that would supply the kind of stout and lusty wooden material necessary for robust or rotund figures. Yet it is noteworthy what happens as the vege- tation begins to thicken. Immediately south of the Bambara are the Senufo, whose rep- resentative pieces have a fleshiness some- what greater than could be found in the art of their northern neighbors. Again, this is largely because the forests are slightly thicker, the organic life fuller. The rotun- dity becomes complete as we come to the Ngere-Wobe, south toward the Atlantic coast.29 Ecology thus provides further ex- planation of the realism of traditional Afri- can art. Labels such as "abstract" are there- fore misleading in describing the work of artists for whom matter and manner are too starkly unified. TRADITION AND ORIGINALITY The problem of tradition and individual talent is one that has engaged several gen- erations of critics, though we have not often drawn the right distinctions between the literate artist's and the unlettered artist's 308</page><page sequence="9">Principles of Traditional African Art views of tradition. It may, of course, be that scholars have today agreed upon an understanding of tradition as a pattern of growth rather than as a rigid invariable. But though we can reasonably trace the his- torical origins of literate art, we cannot safely do the same for the unlettered kind; which makes it that much more difficult to establish the relationship which the tradi- tional artist's talent bears to works which his community has come to accept as stand- ards of artistic performance. We can per- haps trace the artistic portraits of Julius Caesar's life to the records of that life in ancient Roman literature. But since we cannot accurately date the origins of the myths of the chi wara of the Bambara, or the ibeji of the Yoruba,30 it becomes some- thing of an academic exercise for us to talk of standards in examining various plastic representations of these myths, however old some of them might happen to be; and how do we tell one version of a tortoise-tale from another, if neither of them contains any details that are historically datable? The difficulty of judgment is particularly acute with the plastic arts. In an examina- tion of the art surviving from the past, we have no artists' signatures to guide us in making the right distinctions between inde- pendent creations and those inspired by a "school" of creative thinking. It was noted above that artists whose works enjoyed no patronage or adoption were doomed to ob- livion, as their pieces crumbled with their homesteads. This situation has led art historians and critics to consider those pieces housed in a shrine or a palace, or else excavated in the vicinities of these, as the definitive output of the community, forgetting that much more that did not conform to the fashionable styles of the "schools" might have been done. It would further appear that the exotic interest shown by foreign collectors of African art - going as far back perhaps as the early trad- ing forays of the fifteenth century - has led to a weakening of the old creative integrity. As a result we can note the growth of a prosperous tourist industry catering to for- eign wonder; for the honest creative genius, giving due imaginative expression to the 309 intimate forms of a community's life, has yielded to cheap mercenary interests char- acterized by an unreflective haste to turn out mere photographic copies of chosen models, dishonestly dated. In his search for the truth, the judge of traditional African art is thus faced with a sore question: is the traditional African artist primarily a slave to model, or does he, like the truly imagina- tive leader of his people, seek first and fore- most to give vitality and meaning to the community's life and myth with the aid of his creative vigor? 31 Since we cannot have full confidence in the silent pieces that deck the museum shelves, we must turn to the accounts of the careers of traditional artists. In his Con- temporary Art in Africa, Ulli Beier gives an account of two artists who grew up in the old tradition, one in the service of ritual and the other under the patronage of the royal court. Yemi Bisiri of Oshogbo carves figures for the Ogboni society of the Yoruba, like his father before him. But he has had the courage to make an almost total break from the legacy of his father's days, not only in material (he works with brass instead of wood) but also in style (an almost gothic ornamentation as against the simplicity of the older figures). In Benin, Ovia Idah has made a considerable break from the old ways, using strange materials like ebony and cement instead of the tradi- tional bronze and ivory, and exploring new forms which some of his peers find disturbing. It is interesting to note that Idah's revo- lution has not been tolerated as calmly as Bisiri's. The reason for this can be found largely in the economic life of Benin, which depends considerably on the tourist indus- try. The state government has encouraged the curiosity shops to stock stereotypes of the "Benin head" and copies of antique jewelry. It is therefore understandable that the Benin guild of carvers to which Idah belongs, and the community which benefits so much from their kind of work, should be worried that Idah's originality might harm the tourist economy. Nevertheless, the ca- reers of such representative artists lead us to wonder about the generations before</page><page sequence="10">OKPEWHO them. Have the patterns of myth under- gone alteration as society changed? If so, we would expect the artist to give the new forms due expression, relying on his genius to strike the right selective balance between the new elements and the ancestral legacy. Coming as they do from the old school, Bisiri and Idah attest once again to the restless creative temper of the traditional artist, who has, in fact, a distaste for un- intelligent copy. The problem of tradition and the indi- vidual talent is no easier in the oral arts. But if it is recalled that the folk literature is delivered mostly in performance, we can understand why tradition in this regard faces an even more likely risk of change than in the plastic arts. It should, of course, be emphasized that no artist gets any credit for a brutal violation of the essential legacy, or what Albert Lord has called "the his- toric truth," 32 of a traditional song. But given the fluidity of his medium, and the unpredictable nature of the audiences be- fore whom he occasionally performs, there seems little doubt that for him the domi- nant challenge of the art lies in the peculiar stylistic twists and turns which could be worked on the received material. Put dif- ferently, the aesthetic principle here in- volves a slight tilt of the balance in favor of beauty over truth.33 Even in tales involving true history, it is remarkable how much tinkering with the truth happens, in spite of the singer's claims to the contrary. In Sundiata, for instance, the bard Djeli Mamoudou Kouyate tells us he received the legend "free from all un- truth." The highlight of the story is the defeat of King Soumaoro of Sosso and his disappearance into a cave in Mount Kouli- koro. Niane tells us in his Notes of numer- ous versions of Soumaoro's end. Sir Maurice Bowra, quoting Albert Lord, recalls one such tradition which claims that Soumaoro remained unconquerable to the end, be- coming the hero of an epic of "about ten thousand lines" in which "a special group of singers, old men called Djale, sing the glory of Sumanguru, the hero of the Fetichists, to the accompaniment of a native violin." 34 Such a version could hardly be credited to a bard connected with Sundiata's clan. Nor would all the versions emanating from that clan be expected to agree in all details. Niane also tells us, in his Preface, that "each princely family had its griot ap- pointed to preserve tradition." There is little doubt that such a griot would be tempted to exaggerate the claims to glory of the family to which he was attached35 by playing up the role of a member of that family who took part in Sundiata's victory over Soumaoro. The griot of old Mali earned his keep singing praises, and a little exaggeration now and then did no harm, even if it meant minimizing the role of another family in the interests of the fam- ily for whom he sang. Such an atmosphere of conflicting claims and credits is reflected by Babalola's lament over the fate of his- torical fact in competitions between praise singers of contemporary Yorubaland: It is sad to recall that nowadays, in their bid to outshine one another in social gatherings, some ijala artists shamefully and deliberately corrupt the traditional texts of these oriki orile chants.&gt;6 In a context of persistent social and cultural change, and given the fluidity of the me- dium of music and the unrecorded word, rigid loyalty to received fact would be somewhat difficult, especially in the com- petitive court atmosphere. "Music," says Djeli Mamoudou in Sundiata, "is the griot's soul." And music, especially as an earnest of the will to please, would seem that much more of a threat to the duty to leave the truth unadjusted. We can thus imagine what liberties are taken in the area of purely imaginative literature, or at least literature that is con- siderably free of the tyranny of historical fact. The Mwindo Epic is again a good case in point. The editors tell us they have five other versions of the tale, the longest of which is only half the length of the pres- ent one. On the whole, the Rureke version seems a thoroughly personal performance: within the fabric of the song, the poor transcribers Biebuyck and Mateene are challenged by repeated, rather formulaic commands of "scribe, move on!" One is left with an overwhelming sense of immediacy, 310</page><page sequence="11">Principles of Traditional African Art which perhaps vindicates Lord's observa- tion that "an oral poem is not composed for but in performance." 37 I am not arguing that the traditional African artist has no regard for tradition, assuming tradition to be a hallowed kernel of truth which has to be constantly kept alive by memory. But it seems clear that, in an art form such as this, supported largely by the challenge of ready delivery and the encouragement of ready rewards, the artist is generally forced to rely more on his own creative (i.e., manipulative, among other things) energy than on memory. And it is all to the advantage of tradition, as Babalola has noted of the ijala artists among the Yoruba: Studied or spontaneous improvisation on tradi- tional themes is what the ijala-changers regard as their individual contribution to the repertoire of ijala chants.38 Perhaps this is the best that can be said about the pre-eminence of the dynamic creative will in traditional African art. IV Let us now summarize these observations concerning the principles of the traditional African aesthetics. The traditional African artist is a man with a very pressing sense of real and concrete presences, enjoying the closest intimacy with an environment that is both physical and metaphysical. By means of his dynamic sense of form, he tries in all sorts of combinations, with language as with mate'riel, to give tangible meaning to those visible and spiritual presences which give context to his daily life and thought. And as the truly guiding sensi- bility of his community, he continually leads the way in recreating the progressive forms of the communal myth. In a society where the means of dissemina- tion of ideas is rather limited, it is often the artist who is responsible for giving a firm foundation to new cultural influences that may otherwise have been treated as passing fancies and thus left to disappear. Let us go back to that example of the traditional hair- dresser in Nigeria (see footnote 19). The visiting census officials probably spend only 311 a day or two in the allocated village. But the strange hair-styles which they wear make a deep impression on the local hair- dresser. She reproduces those styles on the heads of her local customers, and to the styles survive the brief sojourn of those who brought them to the new environment. This may be well worth considering as the major means of infiltration of various life- styles and influences which most traditional societies acquire. Or take the case of the village sculptor. Most Nigerian villages have no airfields, but every day planes fly above the heads of their citizens. Because he trades in strange modes and novelties, and knows that he attracts attention and custom in that way, the sculptor endeavors to translate his vague impressions of the planes into carvings which he either sells to curious clients or with which he decorates his shop. Whatever happens, he has suc- ceeded in bringing closer to his community what was at best a distant reality. I have chosen to see the traditional Afri- can artist as an active mind operating in a dynamic context. Indeed, it seems to me that we must re-examine the role which the over-simplifying cliches of religion and world-view play in his work. It is all very well to have recourse to the well-known Keatsian principle -"Beauty is truth, truth beauty"- but this is acceptable only insofar as it would illustrate the conviction that the artist manipulates tradition and its values, giving them fresh relevance, fresh meaning, fresh being. If this is the case, then who is it that supervises this protean exercise and ensures the authenticity of the new forms? In his discussion of the art of the old society, Macebuh states that, "except on those occa- sions when expert opinion was called for, the farmer, the hunter, and the winetapper could be relied upon to muster a sufficiently meaningful response to art, and this merely as part of their general awareness as citizens of a community of beings." 39 This por- trait of social cohesion is an admirable one, but it is a rather inadequate guide to under- standing the growth of art in its context. The situation among the unlettered artists of today cannot be significantly different</page><page sequence="12">OKPEWHO from what it was ages ago. And I feel con- vinced that that "meaningful response"- if it means, as it should, a critical support for the evolution of valid aesthetic stand- ards - can only be supplied by those who, by virtue either of native skill or of long- standing connection with the trade, are qualified to offer intelligent views, not only on the "historic truth" but indeed on the dynamic ingredients of "beauty." In the plastic arts, despite the corrupting influence of tourist demand, only a fellow artist or a man closely connected with the practice of traditional art can make meaningful criti- cism of a piece of craft; these artists still still borrow or condemn each other's styles, and they alone are qualified to suggest whether or not such styles have attained a just balance between old and new. In an oral performance, the masses are not the best critics. As Babalola has amply shown in his work,40 the performer is perpetually at the mercy of the partisan instincts of the mob, whose occasional heckling may tend to force him to be slavishly loyal - against his better instincts - to the "historic truth." Of course, such distractions may well teach the artist artful ways of negotiating his lines around their interests; which is in one sense a dynamic gain to his art. But such accidental benefits play only a limited part in the actual growth of his art; for true technical excellence he generally depends on the knowledgeable comments of fellow bards and skilled judges who can tell whether or not he has made any improve- ments on the best performances of more recent memory. For them, indeed, these improvements are the best insurance of tradition. 1 See W. E. Abraham, The Mind of Africa (Chicago, 1962), p. 41; cf. J.

The trouble with "infinitude is that it suggests a too romantic reluctance to construe the world in finite terms. Lucretius, De Rerum Natura V. 1183 ff, and Statius, Thebaid III. 661 derive religion from fear, as does Freud in his concept of the formidable father-image (see The Future of an Illusion). The Bachama of northeastern Nigeria also have a leg- end that traces the origin of religion to the fear of death: see J. Carnochan, "'Nzeanzo and Won': A Bachama Folktale," Journal of the Folklore In- stitute, IV (1967), 237. For the view of magic as the parent of religion, see Pliny, Natural History XXX, 1 and J. G.

The idea of divine patronage is little more than a veiled claim to bardic authority and excellence, which is made by bards everywhere from classical Greece to contemporary Africa. The interesting picture of the frenzied bard in Tynnichus the Chalcidean (Plato, Ion 534d) is only another one of the Philosopher's unflattering views of poetry. 17Ibid., p. 41. 18 Indeed, it seems plausible to argue that the great moment of traditional African art came when the artist was removed from the staying influence of ritual to the relatively secular environment of the king's court, as witness Ife and Benin.

To give the affair an aura of objectivity, the Federal govern- ment assigned enumerators to states other than those in which they belonged. Some of the female enumerators wore colorful hair styles that had not before been seen in the communities to which they were assigned. Before long, the local hairdressers were reproducing these strange and fascinating styles on the heads of their local clients; the new styles were called "census." (I owe this illustration to the field researches of Marilyn Houlberg, School of the Chicago Art Institute.) It is worth noting that census in this case denotes not the entire exercise, which is too vague to be arrested, but the one concrete feature of it that has caught the interest of the local hair stylist. 24 D.

Moore draws a contrast be- tween the milieux of the novels of Chinua Achebe of Nigeria and James Ngugi of Kenya: he finds that Ngugi's characters are rather lonely, because they are cast against the background of the "vaster scenes" of the Kikuyu savannas, whereas Achebe's scenes teem with fellowship in the "crowded hu- man landscape of the village," against the back- ground of the "surrounding forest.'" 29 See Meauze, p. 57. 313 30 For interesting studies of this myth of twins (Yoruba ibeji), see Timothy Mobolade, "Ibeji Cus- tom in Yorubaland," African Arts, Vol. 4 No. 3 (1969), and Marilyn Hammersley Houlberg, "Ibeji Images of the Yoruba," African Arts, Vol. 7 No. 1 (1973). 31 Because they are prepared to pay so much for the "real old stuff," tourists and collectors have given encouragement to the wildest swindles im- aginable in art traffic. The story is well known in cultural circles around Ibadan, for instance, how "middlemen" would sponsor the mass production of ibeji figures from old or ailing wood (to ensure amputations here and there), have them buried in a garbage heap for a couple of weeks (to ensure the due layer of fungi on removal), then pass .them off on eager clients at strategic outlets! 42A.
