<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN by Richard P. SCHAEDEL I. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the excavation of the Huaca « El Dragón » was to deter mine the precise form and function of a typical prehistoric Peruvian pyra mid mound, of which there are hundreds in various states of preservation along the entire Peruvian coast. Secondarily, the work was carried out as a means of affording field practice to the students of archaeology at the University of Trujillo. Work was commenced with a small group of students in May of 1948 and continued with only voluntary help until September. At that time, the Uni versity contracted a permanent guardian and workman who greatly improved the rhythm of work. In December, the author was successful in obtaining the use of a bulldozer for two half days to remove accumulated debris from in front of the outer walls and corridor. Work continued as before until February 1950, when the author, with the aid of funds granted by the Colt Archaeological Institute, was able to hire three more workmen and purchase a wheelbarrow. It was then possible to excavate the fallen debris in the in terior of the structure. This process was terminated in March 1950, and with the exception of a few minor clearing operations of exterior details by the permanent workman, the work was concluded at that time. The clearing of the Huaca El Dragón was executed by the Institute of Anthropology of the University of Trujillo under the auspices of the Uni versity and by virtue of the authority vested in the rector of the University as president of the Patronato Departamental de Arqueología. Additional economic support for two months of work, as mentioned above, was contri buted by the Colt Archaeological Institute. The material found in the process of clearing is in the Museo Arqueológico of the University of Trujillo,</page><page sequence="2">384 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES and there also are copies of the original ground plans as well as of the draw ings of the friezes. Notices of the work in progress were published in the newspaper « El Co mercio » of Lima on October 27, 1948, and February 18, 1949, and in the June, 1949, issue of the Magazine Archaeology. A report on the wooden idols found in the huaca was published in the Spring 1951 issue of Archae ology. A preliminary report of the excavation is on file with the Patronato Nacional de Arqueología in Lima, Peru. A number of students and interested persons participated at one time or another in the clearing of the huaca. Of these, those whose work was of par ticular value were Sr. Antonio Rodriguez Suy Suy, Ing. Mario Rodriguez and Sr. Manuel Cacho. Sr. Rodriguez Suy Suy was my field assistant through out the work and deserves rating as co-author of this report. Ing. Rodri guez is responsible for the final ground plan. Sr. Cacho, draughtsman for the Institute, did most of the illustrations of the friezes to scale. The Context of the Huaca El Dragón. The huaca El Dragón lies approximately 1, 100 meters N NE of the north ern peripheral wall of the main ruins of Chan Chan, largest prehistoric city in Peru. It is only about 100 meters west of the present Panamerican highway and c. 3 1 /2 km. north of the Plaza de Armas of Trujillo. Along with a few other structures we shall mention shortly, it occupies a rather lonely position on the broad pampa which stretches between Chan Chan and the outlying foothills of the Cordillera Negra, in this instance Cerro Cabras. The immediate ancient structures which are in relatively close proximity to the Huaca El Dragón are : 1) the irrigation canal Vinchansao, which passes about 80 meters north of the huaca in a northwesterly direction ; 2) the huaca Tacaynamo, c. 500 meters S SW and a rifled cemetery c. 600 meters northwest. (Plan of Chan Chan in Kosok : 1965 : 85.) In addition to these there were numerous superficial alignments of stones on the pampa, occa sional traces of a sporadic excavated burial and « suspicious » hillocks, but none of these latter proved to be consequential remains. Of the four units mentioned, only the huaca Tacaynamo appears to have been integrally related to the huaca El Dragón. It will be discussed later. The Vinchansao watered the pampa around the huaca but whether it was con structed before or after the temple cannot be established. The smaller buil dings to the southwest superficially resemble the huaca El Dragón in con struction, but no surface remains were found that indicated any particular reason other than juxtaposition for interrelating them. The role of the cemetery will be discussed later. The earliest references to the huaca are rather imprecise, so that it is not even possible to be sure that they refer to El Dragón. In the plan of Mar tinez Compañon, Lamina LXXXI, « Vestigios de población chimú », which</page><page sequence="3">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 385 is the first general plan oí Chan Chan, he shows by his No. 12, three edifices in the approximate position of the huaca El Dragón and Tacaynamo ; « tres edificios amurallados que indican haber servido para guardar semas ». Since there are no other structures in this zone, except the two small edifices or the two larger huacas, the plan of Martinez doubtless refers to one or all of these. The reference to « amurallado » is correct for El Dragón and the two small structures, but not for Tacaynamo. In any case, the inaccuracy of the plan and brevity of the description can contribute little to our under standing of the ruin as it stands. The next reference comes from Squier, who spent some time describing what appears to have been one of the two huacas. We quote his description : Descending the slope, we encountered, outside oí the great wall, two rectan gular inclosures, situated about a quarter of a mile apart, each containing a trun cated pyramid, or huaca. The first of these inclosures is 252 feet long by 222 feet at the ends... (follows a description of the huaca Tacaynamo)... The other structure referred to corresponds very closely with this. Tt is 240 feet long by 210 feet wide, the outer walls 20 feet high by 8 feet thick, and the interior huaca, or mound, 172 feet long by 152 wide, and 40 feet high. No human remains were found here, but the summit of the mound showed that it had been divided into sections, or chambers, from five to six feet square, by walls of rubble 18 inches thick. I could not resist the conviction that this structure, like the other, had been built for sepulchral purposes, but had not been used. (Squier, 1877 : 119.) The problem of interpreting Squier's remarks rests in the discrepancy of measurements. A second problem arises in his failure to mention any vestiges of decorated walls. Here is the comparative table of measurements : Unit E-W length (outer wall).... | N-S width (outer wall).. E-W length (inner wall) . N-S width (inner wall).. Outer wall height | Outer wall width . Maximum height Squier's measure 73. 64. 52.4 46.3 6.1 2.43 12.1 meters Actual dimension Difference 60. 54. 43. 32.4 4.4 2.8 7.6 plus plus plus plus plus 13 10 9.4 13.9 1.7 minus 0.37 plus 4.5 If we include the room dimensions given by Squier (which by the description, we are hardly entitled to) they come out about the same as those of the cells. While it is fairly certain that Squier saw and measured this huaca, we can offer no explanation for the unusually large margin of error except that he calculated the dimensions rapidly. Of the description, the most poten</page><page sequence="4">386 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES tially useful part is that referring to the room divisions that « the summit of the mound showed ». This may possibly mean that the upper platform, now hopelessly destroyed, contained rooms ; or it may simply be a reference to the cells which are noted on the plan. The total height figure which would reinforce the former opinion cannot be considered a weighty argument, since the other base dimensions are all askew on the plus side, and, as we shall see later, is structurally well-nigh impossible. The room dimensions of Squier are correct for the cells, but the partition walls are at least a meter wide and not of rubble construction. We can frankly make no use of this reference. Horkheimer (1944:70-71) briefly described the condition of the huaca which he called « Cientopies » or « Hundred legs » about 1943. He recorded the fact that « un buscador de tesoros » had denounced the huaca in January of 1943. As we shall discuss later, this person (Sr. Neira) was responsible for a rather considerable destruction of the structure, but fortunately we were able to obtain from him at the site itself important data on his actual digging and the material he found. Horkheimer reproduced photographs of the first four panels of the south base wall of the main platform. The photo graph of panel 4 (Horkheimer : fig. 61) shows the state of the corridor before we began work. He noted the fact that the exterior walls were also decorated with friezes « en algunos sectores » and that they were painted in red and yellow. As we shall indicate further on, we found abundant traces of red painted fragments, but not in situ relief decorated in red. We did, however, find in situ friezes with white coloring. The rest of Horkheimer's commen tary refers to the close analogies between the frieze motives of el Dragón and the huaca Chotuna. We shall have occasion to refer to this important comparison at the end of our report. When we began the clearing of the huaca, the condition of the edifice was as follows ; the entire mass appeared to be solid, i.e. without a through corridor, since the south corridor was filled in solidly with debris. The south west corner had the same broken profile that is shown on the plan, and this break, if it really was a late destruction, was utilized by trucks to penetrate within the walls for loading adobes. Evidence of this most recent destruc tive procedure was clear in the tracks left by the wheels, and shortly before we began work we had occasion to frighten off one such vehicle. The south west face of the edifice proper was in much the same state that it had been when Horkheimer photographed the friezes adorning it. The perforation in the wall was the same. Later the cause of this perforation and it's relationship to other similar holes will be explained. The sand had covered all of the exter nal friezes completely, so that by only brushing away from 10 to 50 centi meters of sand we were able to establish the fact that the friezes existed on all three sides exposed. The mark of the level on the external walls to which the sand was accumulated before work started can be easily detected by noticing on the photographs the uppermost « sand-lens ». The central area was covered with debris, so that neither the terrace pattern, room pattern, nor ramp and upper platform were at all manifest. The entire surface, except</page><page sequence="5">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 387 for an obvious recent pit, was rather hard. The debris had consolidated with the wind-born sand and the moisture of the light fog to produce the har dened crust, which we knew later was the result of not more than eight years of action. The Process of the Clearing. Stage 1 : The External Walls. In order to determine the maximum exten sion of the ruin and seek the true entrance, we decided to systematically clear the external walls to the surface, examine the foundation, test for any substructure or annex from this base, and clear the way for excavations of the interior. For this purpose, we proceeded to clear the west wall first, since at the outset we were without the service of a permanent guardian and it was the least visible side. We delimited an area two meters from the wall, excavated up to c. 50 cm. and allowed the sand to fall away from the frieze, only clearing off the details with a brush when the sand stuck in the crevices. This method proved highly satisfactory. Even so, a few fragments of frieze fell with the falling support of the sand. These fragments we accu mulated in small piles in front of their respective sites with the intention of attempting to reattach them later. In the clearing process, we gathered all artifacts, first by zones, and then after noting that the immediate context along the outer periphery wall was nonsignificant, considered all the mate rial from one side as from a single general context. Previous to the clearing, we had sunk various pits and trenches from the side of the huaca to a peri phery some 10 meters out to check the possible existence of peripheral an nexes or structures. Once the possibility of the existence of such structures was eliminated, we proceeded to use the area for the debris of the clearing. The entire clearing of the west wall was effected by one workman, occasion ally assisted by three students under the direction of the author. While the wall was being completely exposed, and afterward, a retaining wall was built on the outside to prevent refilling of the trench. Once the west wall had been cleared, the north wall was cleared in the same fashion (Pl. 1 a, b). Again, with the artifacts that were encountered, one single context was assigned for the entire wall. A similar disposition was made for the frieze fragments encountered, as had been made for the west wall. Finally, the south wall was cleared. The south wall proved the most difficult because of the greater accumulation of sand on that side. In order to faci litate the erection of a retaining wall, we were fortunate enough to secure the use of a bulldozer, which removed the debris that had been excavated in clearing the wall, some 5-10 meters further out (PI. 2). The workman was thus able to construct a fairly effective, high retaining wall at c. two meters distance from the exterior wall. As was the case with the two walls previously cleared, the same procedure was followed with the frieze fragments and artifacts that were found while clearing the south wall. Stage 2 : Clearing of the Ramp, Corridors and South Interior Rooms. Some</page><page sequence="6">388 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES time beiore the bulldozer was enlisted, work had already begun to establish the outlines of the edifice proper. The upper walls delimiting the edifice were cleared, so that we could determine the rough plan our work would follow. In this process, on the north side, we encountered at the foot of one of the friezes a cache of wooden idols described in Schaedel (1951C). Once the perimeter of the edifice proper was established, we devoted our atten tion to the definition of the entrance. This stage of the excavation proved most delicate, since we had to remove the debris which had been pounded into the structure by the trucks and workmen, and hardened by the rains. The problem of distinguishing a true floor level became exasperating, since in many cases the actual floor level of part of the ramp had been utilized by the workmen, and in other cases it had been broken through, and instill others covered up. All three cases might occur in a one meter square section of ramp. By careful probing, however, we located the boundary of the ramp, estab lished its lower extension until the point at which it was broken and pro ceeded to clear away the debris that intervened between its possible conti nuation and the rest of the southern perimeter. At this point we were again aided by the bulldozer which removed a large portion of debris which had accumulated in our clearing of the interior. With the corridor more clear, we were able to penetrate to floor level near the break between the ramp and the beginning of the friezes on the main edifice. We were concerned at this point in determining if this space was utilized as a second entrance, or had been broken down in recent (post-indigenous) or post-construction times. We were not entirely successful in determining this, but the founda tions that we did discover at least supplied us with arguments to support the most probable reconstruction of this puzzling sector. The artifacts en countered in this phase of our work were numbered according to convenient points in the immediate periphery of which they had been found. This pro cedure proved to be excessive because in all cases the artifacts and bones had been previously disturbed, and the context was of only secondary im portance in calculating how far they may have been pitched from a presumed original location. The work of clearing the ramp was completed, and attention was turned to the rooms on the south side, since it was expected to fill up this corridor once again so that later on the bulldozer might again empty it. WTith the corridor clear, we were able rapidly to expose the exterior of the south facing to the base, and we noted two large breaks into the rooms from floor level. (Both of these, we later learned, were made by Sr. Neira in an ingenious though hardly creditable tunneling procedure some years before.) Taking advantage of these, we cleared partially from the top, but mostly from the bottom, taking care that any evidence of roofing be preserved in the con dition it had fallen, until it was photographed or drawn. WTe cleared room 4 first to use it as a storehouse for materials and the commoner type of arti facts that we did not want to carry back to the University (rope, thatch,</page><page sequence="7">THE HUACA EL DRAGON 389 beams, plaster, adobes, etc.). Then we cleared the room 1, which also had the perforation, and followed with the rooms 2 and 3. We found at floor level that a tunnel (the product of the same Sr. Neira) connected all the rooms laterally. Despite the fact that these rooms had been tunneled through previously, we were able to get important data on fallen roofing from the more or less intact upper sections of rooms 2 and 3. Needless to say, the artifact content was negligible. Stage 3 : The platform and other rooms. When the southwest section had been completely cleared, we directed ourselves to clearing the upper plat form, using the central area as a dumping ground as well as the « broken room » area via which we expected subsequently to remove material from the center. The platform proved to be only minimally intact, and rapidly broke off into the core of the pyramid proper. We probed all extensions of the platform as well as any main through courses within the core, to determine if possible the substructure of what no longer existed. Certain useful details emerged, but most of the evidence was negative, and we determined to leave the examination of the core until the end. We proceeded then to clearing the north series of rooms (10, 11, 12, 13, 14), since by this time we had for tunately interviewed our nemesis, Sr. Neira, who explained to us the total extent of his depredations, and thus obviated the necessity of our clearing the east rooms (6, 7, 8, 9). Since Rooms 10 and 11 had not been perforated, we were obliged to exca vate them from the top, using two and occasionally three workmen in stages. In this part of the work, we filled in room 10 after clearing it, with the debris of room 11, to speed up the work. The artifact content in the first two rooms was considerably higher than on the south side, and in room No. 11, a layer of c. 15-20 cm. of undisturbed material was encountered which was of in estimable value in our later interpretation of the function of the building. Otherwise we found, as we did in all other parts of the huaca, where Sr. Neira had not « excavated », only disturbed material from what we are fairly sure was a Spanish (Colonial Period) sacking of the ruin. Stage 4. The exposing of the Core, a check of the foundations, false en trance, external terracing and « towers ». In this last phase, we were concerned basically with establishing any other architectural feature that might be determinable, and no longer with the complete clearing of the building for presentation. Our first effort was dedicated to determining the construction of the huaca core, which had been perforated to sterile sand by Neira pre viously. We succeeded in clearing away the results of his digging and expo sing the construction of a large section, but we could not completely clear the center because of the excessive debris and our own limited time and funds. For two to three weeks, three and four men were employed in relays removing debris with wheelbarrows, until we were satisfied that no major transverse supports were in evidence and that no substructure existed. We</page><page sequence="8">390 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES reinforced the platform with adobes and left this sector to check other pro blematical points. One of these, the possibility of supports or substructures under any of the four corners, we settled with a short trench under each of the corners, encountering only sterile sand. These trenches we immediately filled in. Another questionable point was the mysterious « blank panel » on the west perimeter wall. We removed sufficient adobes on the inner section of the wall to determine that it was not an intentionally closed section but a nor mal continuation of the perimeter wall. Finally, we traced the corners of the main edifice on the north side, followed the terrace linings on the north side to their fusion with the ramp descent and, satisfied that we had accom plished all we could to clarify the form of the building, we closed the exca vation. A word should be said here about the conditions under which all this work was carried out. As noted before, much of the preliminary clearing was done with volunteers. A guardian was contracted in September of 1948, and since then until the completion of the work, one was living near the huaca. Des pite this, the exposed nature of the ruin and its accessibility to the Panameri can highway made it a frequent object of visits ; certain destruction from walking over it and from schoolboy prodding resulted. Conditions of water supply made it necessary to arrange either to have water brought to the guardian, or have him come to Trujillo periodically. This also occurred when he was to be paid. These factors made 100 percent protection impossible. The seasonal heavy fog which oftentimes amounts to a drizzle has washed away some of the faint traces of color which the low reliefs had when first uncovered, but since the color was already faint, the damage is negligible. The disturbed condition of the University, which changed hands three times, hindered effective long range, planned work ; and made it necessary to carry on the excavation in spurts of activity and prolonged lulls, oftentimes without the necessary equipment of boxes and bags to carry the material in. The collapsing of the roof over the Institute where the material was hou sed, which occurred a few months before the excavation was completed, resulted in the emergency transfer of all the material under conditions diffi cult to control, and some of the artifacts were damaged and lost in the pro cess. Nevertheless, the basic data are all still on hand from which to draw the main outlines of the cultural significance of this singular archaeological monument. II. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE HUACA EL DRAGON When I stated at the outset that our purpose was to « determine the precise form of a typical prehistoric Peruvian pyramid mound, of which there are hundreds... », I was correct.

It is therefore important to state at this juncture that the description which follows refers to a small class of pyramid mounds with a limited temporal and spatial distribution which will be explained later on. The huaca is laid out with a base orientation 12° E of N (Plan 1). At the stage to which our excavations carried us, we are almost positive that the entrance to the ramp faced south, though it may have had one more turn at the base toward the west. The general structural orientation of the huaca is, however E-W, since the ramp leads to a doorway which opens into an entrance platform and what was apparently a broad causeway leading to the main rectangle which constitutes the mass of the structure. The edifice proper may thus be divided into the following sections : the ramp (W. 8.8 m.) the entrance platform, the presumed causeway (5.5 m x 16.4 m.), the main platform with peripheral rooms (27.2 m x 32.4 m.). The basic overhead form, then, is that of a rectangle, almost square, with an L shaped approach. The huaca in profile, seen from the entrance side, represents an incline from floor level, 12 m. in length to a height of 7 ,6m., a buttressed wall main taining this level for 10 m., whence it drops to a buttressing ledge of 5.2 m. in height and then abruptly terminates. The back or eastern profile is roughly symmetrical. The outer wall of 4 m. in height continues for 5.2 m., whence with a slight buttressing terrace it rises to 4.2 m. and then reaches the high level of 6.6 m. which is maintained for approximately 20 m., and then repeats the drop just described. The side profiles are so damaged that there is little purpose in detailing them here. Around the entire structure with the excep tion of the break on the SW corner runs a perimeter wall, 54 x 60 meters with an average height of four meters. The Divisions. The Perimeter Wall. Although this element was undoubtedly built last, it is convenient in describing the architecture in detail to commence here. The wall, which is free-standing, has a base thickness of 2.9 meters and tapers to a width of 2 meters at a height of 4.4 meters on the east side. On the west side it is 2.6 meters wide at the base and tapers to 1.7 meters at the height of 3.4 meters. The same proportions obtain for the east and south walls. With the exception of the east wall, all the walls either still have or indicate having had friezes completely covering their exterior facing. Even the east wall probably had, as there are faint traces of some low reliefs at the base which were preserved ; but the main body of the wall, if it had them, has been washed bare by the floods. The wall is entirely constructed of adobes and a clay mortar. No consistent system of adobe placement to insure sta bility could be observed. On the contrary, the adobes were apparently simply superimposed, and the resulting tapering was arrived at more by rule of thumb than by any calculation (PI. 3 a). Noticeable sags and repatching are visible at many points because of the technique of the wall construction, and the profile is more characterized by undulations than by chance straight sec</page><page sequence="14">392 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES tions. The south wall, perhaps because the most solidly based, shows the best vertical profile. The damages suffered by the other walls through floods and other destruction have doubtless contributed to their present shabby appearance, but even discounting all possible subsequent effects, the extant cross sections of these walls demonstrate a basic sloppiness in the wall cons truction which is not as typical of the south wall. Once the wall was constructed, a thin « plaster » coat of clay was applied to cover the traces of the adobes, and apparently while still moist and adhe sive, the vertical panels and frieze figures were applied. No subterranean foundations exist for the walls. They rest upon what was apparently the last flood-packed cap of sand below the windblown surface. Under one of the corners an accumulation of large stones was noted. Similarly, no effort was made to level the ground, so that the wall follows pretty much the undula tions of the slightly sloping pampa. No effort was made to decorate the inside wall facing except for the appli cation of a thin coat of clay to present an even surface. The friezes will be discussed in more detail in a later section. The only other observation to be made on the perimeter wall is that pos sibly its original profile preserved somewhat the general outlines of the main edifice. Thus even though the south wall rises and falls, at least in the western end, due to a break, it may well have had such a slope, to parallel the side profile of the edifice. The northern wall, which is low at the eastern extremity and then maintains a high level, with a slight drop to the west, may also reflect this purpose. The western wall is too damaged to warrant our judgment, and the eastern wall would give an even or roughly even profile at any rate. The main edifice ; ramp and entrance. The Ramp. Although the actual beginning of the ramp is broken, the general pattern it had is fairly clear. It apparently began as a broad plat form at floor level, narrowed to an entrance gateway and again widened out to a small gateway above, leading to the entrance platform. It is sup ported principally by the main west wall of the edifice proper, which has a median width of three meters and rises with the ramp to the height of 7.6 meters. The eastern support of the ramp is constituted by what appears to have been a high partition wall 1,4 meters in thickness at the base (PI. 3 b). This partition wall was apparently buttressed by a transverse partition wall, which thus formed a room, originating in what would be the western pro longation of the first terrace of the southern wall. It was more effectively supported by the transverse interior wall forming the southern side of the « causeway » and which apparently joined with the main platform originally. The maximum width of the ramp is 4.6 meters, and the gateway is 1.8 meters. It is lined in its entirety by friezes facing in. The length of the ramp from exit of doorway to exit of doorway is 10.6 meters and the inclination is 28°, somewhat steep.</page><page sequence="15">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 393 The flooring of the ramp is not especially noteworthy. It appears to be nothing more than puddled clay more or less pounded down in an even inclined surface. Underneath, the structure is made of mixed adobes and puddled mud. Some evidence that the floor was repaired at one or another time was noted in probing for it, but no overall layers were discerned. It appears that such repairs were like modern « patching » of asphalt streets. The logical extension of the ramp is the section we have classified as the platform entrance, which forms the last southward bend of the « L » exten sion of the structure. This platform is the only part of the « second story » of the edifice that has been preserved, although it is more than likely that the platform extended on much the same level to the causeway and main platform. As a unit, the entrance platform displays the same characteristics as the ramp, but is apparently shifted in orientation from a basically N-S position to an E-W position. The 5.8 meter level of the platform is main tained but lined with a peripheral wall, decorated with friezes again facing in, which in its present state rises an additional 1.6 meters. On the exterior facing, or the west wall of the edifice proper, the wall drops via two terraces to the floor level. A break in the wall at the midway point may be an inten tional opening to one of the terraces, but since they then in turn terminate, on the ramp side, in the mass of the west supporting wall and on the north in a questionable extension of the terrace, this is unlikely. The external facing of the section is sheer on the west until the height of the entrance platform is attained. At this point the base wall is staggered by the terrace which runs the length of the wall, and the exterior part of the wall above the terrace was decorated with friezes. At the northern ter mination, the meter-wide buttress wall, which supported the west side, is dropped, and only the terrace marks the northern facing. Dropping from the terrace ridge is the base wall, decorated its entire length with friezes. This wall can be traced in an easterly direction for 15 meters, where it defines the causeway and terminates with a sharp northward bend at the beginning of the main platform. The terrace with its exterior decoration, runs only 3.5 m., or the length of the entrance platform, after which it is hopelessly lost in the destruction, which was particularly severe in this crucial sector. As already noted, the southern or base end of the ramp is also lost to us, but we can pick up the east supporting wall and trace it to where it is joined by the remains of a transverse wall, which apparently at one time delimited a large room. This room had been so competely demolished, that our only basis for assuming its existence lay in the foundations and the verbal sta tement of Sr. Neira, who was instrumental in the final pilferage. If these two pieces of information are construed with the logic of the edifice, one may be reasonably sure that the wall sealed off the section and joined it to the main platform. The Causeway. We have already alluded to the causeway, which is essen tially a hypothetical construct. It is made up of the two E-W walls, joining the entrance platform to the main platform, though both are interrupted</page><page sequence="16">394 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES now by the internal destruction of the huaca ; and the flooring they must have supported is completely missing (PL 4). The only other detail of the cause way is the hypothetical room just referred to, which would form a sort of Intersection of the inner wall of the causeway with the en trance platform. The upper courses of adobes are the re constructed support for the floor of the entrance platform. annex to it. With the joining of the south wall of the causeway to the main platform, the entrance to this room would become a problem to "explain but not much more of one than we shall have presently with entrance to the other rooms of the main platform.</page><page sequence="17">0^ 0 e&gt; 0 p 1 N*\W'//% %: * &lt;?&amp; ,01 "oSllWMto.'v«iT% s ,»» ,,&lt;f, f I Ul£. £b „l • • •• c&gt;&lt;Pt&gt;'ooo| el Dragon; Plan Map of F Huaca a &lt;VS."•"•&lt;?&lt;? ^ Huaca el Dragon.'

This technique is used rather consistently in the interior of the huaca, although the work was seemingly performed in sections rather than completely by layers. Thus a certain sequence of two stretcher layers to one header, will be juxtaposed with one of each. There may well have been a certain amount of roofing in this area, particularly in the region topping the problematical room and the terraced area where the causeway joined the main platform on the north side. This we deduce only from rather abundant remains of thatch, rope and canes near these two points. It would be entirely conjectural to imagine how such roofing was installed. The Main Platform. The exterior of the main platform is a widening of the causeway. On the northern side, the continuation is made logical by the continuous frieze decoration, which (except for an enigmatic strut) carries on past the causeway to the end of the entrance platform. On the south side, however, the frieze terminates where the foundation of the room was discovered. It is conceivable but undemonstrable that the frieze decorated the exterior facing of the sealed room and continued to the ramp. At any rate, the frieze, like that on the north side, turns out, in this case south for 5.2 meters, then east, and runs 26 meters or the length of the south wall. Neither the eastern exterior wall of the main platform nor the western wall of the entrance platform is decorated. Within this enclosure are 14 rooms, a northern and southern set of five each and an eastern group of four between them. These « rooms » had best be described as cells. They are 2.7 or 4 meters deep, depending upon whether one counts the lower buttressing ledge on the inside as the top or not. Their size is variable, but the largest is 4 x 2.6 meters and the smallest, 3.6 x 2.6 meters. The frontal part of the rooms is composed of the main outer wall of the main platform, and rises sheerly four meters. The back is broken by a ledge at 2.7 meters with a width of c. 40 cm. Rising from this ledge the wall in clines considerably for 1.6 meters, where it supports the exterior terrace, similar to that described for the entrance platform at from 4.2 to 4.8 meters in height. This terrace is c. 80 cm. wide and is flanked by the frieze-bearing wall of c. 2.2 meters additional height. The ledge which forms the back continues as an independent partition wall separating the rooms. At the end of each of the sections of rooms, howe ver, the ledge abruptly terminates, so that, while it may be used as a sort of precarious catwalk to move between rooms of a given section, it does not communicate with other sections. The terrace apparently was the cat walk, but even it has certain peculiarities. By using the terrace one can walk atop all the rooms on the north and east, but arriving at the northeast corner, he is confronted with the obstruction of the main wall to the internal corner of the room, so that no passage is feasible. If he returns to seek a continua tion on the northwest side, he is again confronted with an impasse, which</page><page sequence="22">396 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES in this instance appears to be a corner of the same main wall as though in tentionally placed to prevent passage. In the latter case, the evidence of a previous flooring underneath and behind this block supports the conten tion that previously the route was open. Indeed, it might explain the curious salient shortly before in the West wall, which would allow passage along the top that otherwise might be hazardous (PI. 5 a). We must therefore consider the possibility of a later modification, which was intentionally aimed at closing the intercommunication of the room sections. How then was com munication effected to the main platform ? Several breaks in the walls in the upper supraterrace section indicate a possible explanation, namely that they were doorways communicating to the various sections. No facing is sufficiently clear to demonstrate this possibility conclusively, however. Roofing in this sector of the peripheral rooms certainly was installed. Insofar as the badly disturbed material was reconstructable we have utilized it. It appears that the only possible area that could have been roofed with the available material was the section between the ledge and the summit. We have indicated how this might have been effected (Plan 2). Whether the roofing was coated with clay to harmonize with the architecture cannot be stated, but some fragments of clay which had been attached to wooden beams and thatch were found, indicating at least some part of the roofing was finished in clay. The possibility that the rooms themselves were roofed is remote. No evi dence of large enough cross beams was found, and it is highly dubious that such elaborate roofing would have been undertaken in a wood-scarce region. It is reasonable also to suppose that such roofing would have left marks in the walls, and none was found, although we searched carefully. The Core and Superstructure. The excavation of the center of the buil ding demonstrated that the periphery of this structure was essentially solidly filled with adobes. As the work approached the center, the masonry revealed was less and less regular, and seemed to reflect a system of accumulating adobes and mortar and rapidly mixing them together to produce a mass which was later given form. Some basis exists for positing various levels for the upper platform, but nowhere except on the periphery is there a trace of a floor level upon which to calculate, and these traces all correspond to the same top level. Hollow Center. On the four corners of what we call the main platform are slight moundlike eminences which terminate in a small flat surface c. 1 meter square. No clearcut facing could be distinguished, and they appear to have been either accidents of the destruction, curiously symmetrical, or else ar chitectural adornments, equivalent to simulated « towers » or turrets. Facing in to the platform are a few indications of what might have been room partitions, but the evidence is so fragmentary that it is useless to spe culate on what might have been their function. The main platform taken as a whole has the following structural features. Its principal elevation was somewhat over six meters, which was maintained</page><page sequence="23">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 397 over a square mass c. 10 meters on a side. The main support of the platform was the core of the huaca, the base of which was solidly composed of mas sed adobes and puddled mortar. The lateral supports were formed on the west by the structures of the causeway and entrance platform. Of these the two main transverse walls of the causeway were the most weighty. On the other three sides the base support was essentially a frame construction (if we may use the term in adobe architecture) which distributed the weight on the network of a basic peripheral wall internally strengthened by thinner partition walls running transverse to it and the exterior facing of the core wall. Thus the basic peripheral wall, while attaining the same height as the freestanding outer peripheral wall has only a basal width of from 1.8 to 2 me ters and tapers at its 4 meters summit to from 1.2 to 1.4 meters (compare the outside proportions). The intervening partition walls are only a meter in thickness. The struc ture of these walls, however, is consistently header and stretcher and well laid, as the chance profiles show. The facing of the core proper is consider ably inclined and buttressed by the ledge formation before it achieves the terrace height of 4.7 meters. The second gradation is stepped back some 80 cm. and again with incline, rises to the maximum wall height of 6.4 meters. Even assuming the wall from the terrace to the summit attained a somewhat higher altitude, it must not have exceeded 2.5 meters, judging by the re construction of the frieze panels. Thus, it is unlikely that the pyramid would have supported additional stories. Construction of the Huaca. Masonry. The basic adobe types used in the huaca were according to shapes ; rectangular, corniced and trapezoidal. The rectangular type measures 28 x 15 x 15 cm. A variant of this with a crease (produced probably by the binding cord of the mould in which it was made) around the middle measures 29 x 18 X 18 cm. An almost square type, also with cord marks, measures 39 x 38 x 34 cm. The corniced types, by which we mean with top (or bottom depending upon placement) projecting may be noted in the illustrations. By long di mensions they are in the following sizes : 25, 27, 32, 44. The variant on the corniced type has one side where the projection does not occur. The trapezoidal type is represented by two sizes : 26 and 28.5 cm. Gener ally, the rectangular types were the most frequently used for the internal walls in various « header and stretcher » patterns. The large corniced adobes were used largely on the exterior walls and in the core. From the chance cuts we could observe, the function of the cornice seems to have been to allow the mortar to « lock » the adobe to its partner rather than to allow for any interlocking of the adobes proper. The placing of the adobes does not indicate that the cornice was preferably up or down or for that mat ter alternating, though the latter is what one would expect. The large over</page><page sequence="24">398 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES sized adobes seemed to have been used mostly in the base of the exterior walls and the core. The use of the trapezoidal type adobe could not be as certained, but it seems to be nothing more than a development of the idea embodied in the corniced adobe. Only on the platform base did we notice any consistent tendency to place the corniced adobes with projecting ledge upmost. The methods of laying the adobes were basically three : stretcher and header in alternate rows ; superimposed or columnar ; and puddled or simply ran dom placement of adobes in puddle clay mortar. The stretcher and header technique was observed in most of the internal wall construction ; the cross section of the framing wall of the main plat form (Plate 2), the facing of the ledge wall, the partition wall joining the last two, the wall above the terrace, and finally the east ramp sup port. The most careful and consistent use of the technique was observed on the ledge wall. On the ramp support, the work nearest the ramp entrance is better, and the headers gradually disappear as the wall attains maximum height, the construction then falling into the columnar type superposition of adobes. Intermittently the stretcher and header method is used on the exterior wall, but not enough examples were available to determine what situations governed the choice of this procedure. The simple superposition is characteristic of the exterior walls and is noted also for the core and the higher segments of the ramp support. The puddle method was used for the core, near its base, and in a spot where an alteration was made in front of the ledge of the east wall, room No. 9. It is also one of the three methods noted for the construction of the peri meter wall. The only intrusive-looking wall noted in the entire huaca was the foun dation of the room between the ramp and the main platform. This wall was made of stones in clay mortar. The only other use of stones in the construc tion was the suspicious accumulation near the base of the NW corner, where they may have been heaped for possible reinforcement of the foundation. All internal walls not decorated with low-relief friezes were coated with « enlucida » a clay coating that covers the adobe margins, c. 1 cm. thick. As noted before, the structure was all-adobe construction with the excep tion of the roofing that apparently covered the area between ledge and sum mit, at least on the three sides with rooms. The roof was apparently sup ported by pole frames and constituted by bundled thatch. Possibly the cor nices were coated with clay. Alterations. There are three points in the huaca which indicate that at one time or another after its construction, the building was altered, exclud ing for the moment consideration of the burials. 1. The « False » corners. The NW and SE corners of the terrace as we have noted above appear to have been intentionally obliterated, in one case, possibly by extending the corner of the superstructure, and in the other</page><page sequence="25">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 399 by adding a block. (Plate 5 a). The presumption is that both opera tions were alterations done with the same purpose of obstructing inter communication between sections via the terrace, but only the NW cor ner shows clearly the alteration. 2. The filling in of the « false » ledge in room 9 facing the E wall. This room was not excavated, so we cannot explain this alteration, but simply point out its existence. It was filled in crudely but well finished. 3. The partition wall or foundation of stone defining the « room » between the ramp and main platform. This wall, when first encountered was consi dered intrusive and the product of a pre-Spanish alteration of the huaca, when the room was reused as something else. Sr. Neira reported that the room was intact when he broke into it, so that we were inclined to doubt our first supposition. If not a reuse, the use of stone foundations remains for us inexplicable. A second feature of this room which is also unique for the huaca, is the low banquette which was uncovered at the NE corner and which apparently flanked the northern and eastern sides of the enclosure at approximately one meter height. This banquette was lined with « enlucida », thus indicating its finished character. It is not out of line to suppose that this room had other functions than the cells, and for this reason the banquettes are logical enough. They may also be doubly functional in that they buttressed the walls, though at unusually low levels. The engineering of the huaca has been largely explained in the process of the description. The ledge and terrace supports for the immediate walls containing the main mass of the structure are uniform in all sides except the area of the causeway, where the stress is transverse. The only problem resides in the lack of ledge support on the northern exterior of the entrance platform. This sector was not completely cleared to the base (because of the problem of having no vacant area for disposal of the debris) so that it is not impossible that the huge mass of debris covers some structural sup port on this side. III. THE FRIEZES The friezes will be discussed under the four sections which seem to cor respond to integrated units ; 1) the external friezes in the order : North Wall, West Wall, South Wall ; 2) the frieze of the base wall of the main platform : south side of the main platform, causeway north side ; 3) frieze of the ramp and upper platform ; 4) fragments of terrace friezes and fragments without specific association. The External Friezes. The general plan of the friezes on the exterior is one of alternating ver tical and horizontal panels filled with low relief. Each panel is separated</page><page sequence="26">400 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES from the other by a vertical strip of undecorated low relief. On the corners that are preserved, and near the presumed center of the west wall, an addi tional pair of panels of superimposed warriors (usually at least three are indicated) is inserted. The only other irregularity in the succession of panels is again in the horizontal panel in the center of the west wall, which was Pl. 6 Northwest corner, showing framing panel 1 and vertical panel 2 (Motive I). intentionally left blank. Otherwise the vertical panels are decorated with two or more main figures in a vertical composition, apparently moving to wards each other ; and the horizontal panels represent a horizontally com posed scene of double headed « serpents » and homunculi, usually in a fixed environment with slight modifications. Because the eastern extremes of both the northern and southern wall friezes are destroyed, we are obliged to number the panels from the corner whence they are best preserved. The numbering of the panels for both the</page><page sequence="27">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 401 northern and western wall starts from 1 at the NW corner. The south wall, since it is broken at both ends, is arbitrarily numbered from the first iden tifiable panel on the western end. The North Wall. The sequence of panels on the north side is the following. One vertical (framing), followed by five pairs of vertical and horizontal pa nels, then one vertical to a break in the wall. From this point on the sequence is open to reconstruction (PI. 6, 7 a, 8, 9). The width of the panels on the north side varies considerably ; generally it increases on the horizontal panels from E to W. The vertical panels are of two sizes which seem to correspond to the requirements of the figures en closed ; one, very wide (1.05 m.), and two small (sizes 63-66 cm. and 78 80 cm.). All the friezes on the north side have been water washed, so that they are in the worst state of preservation. No traces of color were preserved on this side. Near the western corner, the lower portions of the friezes are again in relatively good shape, although the framing motive at the end is badly weath ered, and it cannot be determined if it was meant to represent a figure facing east or west or whether there was a cramped vertical panel superimposed between the framing figure and the last horizontal panel (PL 10 a, and 11). What is clearly distinguishable is that the last (or if one prefers) the first horizontal panel shows the arc motive with the suggestion of serpentine form animals enclosed, and that they make their first identifiable appearance in the successive horizontal panel. The intervening area is badly damaged, and attempts at reconstructing the panel sequence must be considered purely conjectural. It is even pos sible that at a certain point the friezes fell and were replaced out of their original context. The West Wall. Counting from the NW corner there are a total of twenty three panels before the break in the SW corner. Panel No. 1 is the framing panel. After it are five pairs of vertical and horizontal panels, one vertical panel followed by another framing panel, facing in this instance panel No. 14, the blank one. Continuing on the other side, the sequence is one framing panel (facting to the blank panel) followed by four pairs of horizontal and vertical panels. From the second to the ninth panel, the widths are over large, and (with the exception of No. 5) continue the tendency of adding motives observed on the north wall. With panel 10, however, and from there to the end, all the panels are foreshortened. Thus the range in widths for the vertical panels (not including the framing panels) is from 55 to 1.05 me ters and for the horizontal panels from 1.97 to 4.04 meters. Explanation of this great variation will be attempted in the section on interpretation. The lower sections of all these friezes, especially those below the lowest flood cap, were well preserved, and the whites and yellows though flaky could be distinguished. The probable base color of rose or red, was in all cases missing. The upper sections were badly weathered, as the photographs clearly show.</page><page sequence="28">402 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES The South Wall. This wall, which was the best preserved of the three, thanks to the southern winds, shows twenty panels up to the point where the cover age was no longer adequate to protect it. A partially preserved vertical panel is numbered one, though it was not the corner panel in all probability. This is followed by three pairs of horizontal and vertical panels, one hori zontal panel and a breakthrough in the wall, where a vertical panel once must have been. After the breakthrough, there are five pairs of horizontal and vertical panels until the condition of the wall prevents any further defi nite delineation. The hypothetical reconstruction of the end of this wall will be dealt with in the section under reconstruction. It is to be remarked here that the panels are of almost uniform size on this wall. The nine horizontal panels average 2.58 meters in width with a range from 2.32 to 2.64 meters. All but one panel (No. 2) are vithin a range of 4 cm. The vertical panels range from 63 to 95 cm. with six of the nine having the variance of only 3 cm. Perhaps, coupled with this consistency in dimensions, is the better and more standardized execution of the figures on this wall. Where the comparison can be justly made is between the lower sections of the west wall and this one, and not only is there less variation in the execution, but also in composition, bespeaking beforehand planning, which seems to be almost at random on the west wall. Stylistic differences can also be detected. Of these the most obvious is the linear, crisp outlines of the figures on the south wall, compared to the rounded, softer modelling of the figures on the west wall. In the modelling of the framing figures, one can almost detect three-dimensional modelling. It is fairly clear that the two walls were decorated by different artists. The state of conservation of the friezes, when discovered, was approxi mately the same as those of the west wall, except that more of the yellow and white paint had flaked off, probably because of wind action. Only the eastern section had been exposed to flood waters. The same general obser vations about colors may be made here as about the west wall. The figures and the arcs were generally painted yellow, when paint was found, and white was reserved for eye coloring. The height of the panels probably followed the height of the walls. As mentioned before, it is impossible to state whether the wall had a definite rising-falling contour, although this is likely. If so, the south wall may be taken as typical of the complete horizontal panel for an external wall. The horizontal panel in that case can be divided in two, vertically at c. 1.80 me ters height, where the lower unit of design reaches its maximum height. If this pattern was followed on the west wall, it would have been the same, since the only complete lower panel design also measures 1.80 meters. We do not know enough about the upper sections of the friezes to say more than that it appears they repeated grosso modo the bottom half of the wall design, which seems to have been intentionally planned to be kept below the two-meter level. The vertical panels offer no problem. They occupy the total height of the wall, and breaks seem to come at any point in the design.</page><page sequence="29">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 403 Friezes of the Base Wall of the Main Platform. South Side. The frieze probably covered the entire southern wall, but only 12 meters of it are preserved. The short section that extends along the west projecting base wall is probably complete. If it continued, it turned at right angles again and faced south. The southern section, counting from the SW angle of the main platform, consist of 1) a framing section and 2) three pairs of horizontal and vertical panels. The framing section is composed of what amounts to one vertical panel with three superimposed staff-bearing figures and a horizontal band of 1.03 meters in height composed of the same figures in various states of fragmen tation. The paired panels are not only separated one from the other by a strip of undecorated relief, as in the exterior friezes, but from the first strip on (not counting that which defines the frame), they are enclosed in a single horizontal strip, joining the individual vertical strips, and separating the framing section from the panels. The size of the panels is roughly compa rable to that of the exterior panels in width (1.93, 2.62, and 2.70 meters), but the height is considerably greater for the principal composition of the horizontal panels, which average 2.92 as compared with the 1.8 meters height adhered to on the same design composition of the exterior wall decoration. The vertical rise of the triple « arc » is hence lengthened and the central figures enclosed within it are considerably enlarged. The size of the framing figures is also greater both in width and in height than the corresponding framing figures on the exterior friezes. The heights of the figures are, from bottom to top, 1.42, 1.13, and 1.05 meters, while those on the exterior aver age around 90 centimeters. The direction of all the figures, which indicates the direction of the frieze is to the west, or the entrance end of the huaca. The section of the west projecting base wall consists of a single horizontal panel enclosed within a frame (PL 18 b). The frame is complete and alike on both flanking sides, and like the south wall frame, it is composed of three superimposed figures joined at the top by a horizontal band made up in this case of three figures. All are proceeding in the same direction as the first named contingent. The central panel, from what remains of it, is composed of the same design elements as those on the south wall. Sections at the base of panels two and three of the south wall showed traces of yellow and white paint in the flaky state, when they were first dis covered. It is logical to suppose that this frieze did not end abruptly with this last framed panel, and the most likely supposition is that at one time it turned west again to lead past the now destroyed room to some sort of enclosure with the ramp. The frieze at the base wall of the main platform-causeway and entrance platform. North side (PI. 19). This frieze which can be traced past the three divisions mentioned, has not been cleared sufficiently to warrant full description. Problems of dump</page><page sequence="30">404 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES ing precluded our working to the wall base for most of this area. We are reasonably sure that, on the basis of fragmentary conservation of the north wall and west wall projection, the same frieze pattern just described for the south wall was adhered to. A portion of what would be framing panel 1, starting from the NW corner, was cleared, panel 2 is partially discernible, and there are vestiges of undeterminable frieze fragments along the length of the upper section of the north wall. On the western projection, the framing section is visible, though weathered, and corresponds to the pro cession of staff-bearing figures described for the corresponding section of the southern base wall. Since the dimensions of the wall are in both ins tances almost equal, it is reasonable to suppose they were decorated in a like manner (PI. 20 a, b). The frieze is also oriented, to judge by the direction in which the figures face, toward the west or entrance of the huaca. The extension of the frieze past the projection wall can be stated and observed in part, but not enough is exposed to determine its patterning. That it maintained total wall height at least until it turned definitely west to line the exterior wall of the causeway, is clear from the weathered frag ments which continue following the strut in a southward direction to the intersection with the causeway wall. After this, fragments of well-preserved frieze panels, only partially cleared, are noted at the lower levels only, so that it is possible that the pattern followed in the exterior friezes was here resumed to finish off thedecoration of the exterior of causeway and north ern facing of the entrance platform. The Friezes of the Ramp arid Upper Platform. There are a number of incomplete panels which give some idea of how the frieze decoration lined the ramp, and in view of the significance of the ramp, it is worth attempting as complete a description as possible. The sec tions of friezes are described as follows ; outer passage, outer gate, inner passage (east-side), main ramp wall, upper passage, upper gate ; same for west side. The outer passage is preserved only on the east side. It is composed of two definite short (like vertical, but truncated) panels, and a probable third. Only the first is clear enough to show a figure, as always, facing toward the upper part of the ramp (PI. 21 a). The gate entrance is so badly destroyed that only a piece of low relief remains. What it does show is that there was a single panel here, like the inner gate to be described, and probably the same prostrate figure was represented. Bend one of the east ramp is devoted to one panel of a biped, moving upwards (PI. 21 b). He is flanked on both sides by a strip. The main ramp wall is composed of at least one horizontal panel with motive composition similar to the lower design of exterior wall south. A fragment of a second horizontal panel is visible at the upmost extremity. The length of the ramp is c. 8 meters, which would allow for two horizontal panels with one short panel between, or even three horizontal</page><page sequence="31">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 405 panels. We cannot say what the sequence was here since all the rest of the wall was broken. The upper passage is composed of a framing panel with at least two super imposed homunculi, again as always facing the entrance to the upper plat form. Two blank strips frame the panel (PL 22 b). The upper entrance is flanked on both sides by a single panel of a pros trated figure with what appears to be a rope around his neck, and claws above his head (PI. 22 a). From the fragmentary evidence that exists, the problem of running the frieze on the bias, does not seem to have been too successfully solved. The long panel is quite a disjointed composition. The evidence of the framing panel of the upper passage indicates that the upper platform wall stood at least two meters high, though no part of it remains of more than one and a half meters. The frieze wall probably at tained to the height of at least c. 1.8 m. The west side of the ramp parallels the east side except for the outer pas sage the existence of which is in doubt. The condition of the frieze remains is too fragmentary to warrant reconstruction. The frieze of the upper platform. Of this important section only a few vestiges were observed. The left side, adjoining the upper doorway reveals two partial short panels ; one of a figure proceeding away from the gate, the second a part of a vertical panel motive (PI. 23 a). Both are separated by strips and complete the inner southwest wall. The inner southeast wall has a fragmentary short panel which is indecipherable. Part of the inner north wall shows the remains of one of the typical double-headed « serpents » associated always with the horizontal panels in the exterior friezes, but no pattern can be deduced from the fragmentary state of the wall. Near the break, if it was a break, in the western wall, a large fragment of a head was found (PI. 23 b). Fragmentary Friezes from the Terraces. Friezes above the Terraces. Although the evidence exists that all the terraces carried frieze decoration, all of the traces are so badly weathered and damaged or incomplete that the description will be limited to Chart 1. Fragments of Friezes. Frieze fragments were found at virtually all points of the excavation, most of them already too broken up to be reconstructed or refitted. Worth noting here, however, is that, although green and red were nowhere found intact on the extant friezes, fragments with these colors were found (in rooms 3 and 4, at points 7, 8 and 12), and may indicate that friezes with these colors were used on the terraces and upper platform, and possibly a section of the frieze at the ramp entrance. 8</page><page sequence="32">406 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES IV. INTERPRETATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE FRIEZES In order to discuss the friezes and their possible original form and mean ing, it is convenient to break down the elements into the largest meaningful (or repetitive) segments. The following, then, are the basic segments of the frieze, according to compositional environment. (See Chart 1). Horizontal Panels (fig. 1). I. The « Arc » motive. This is composed of a basic arc, made up of three bands, plus an outer band that contributes along its greater length to the formation of volutes. The two extremes of the arc terminate in identical front face heads (identical except that the mouth appendages and ears have a distal placing). Variations. This form of the motive is considered normal, since it is found repeated in exactly this way the greatest number of times. One main varia tion is noted particularly on the north wall in which the same arc with outer band of volutes, but without the heads, terminates in the base of the frieze. This form is drawn in various degrees of foreshortening and partial com pleteness, but for classificatory purposes, these gradations are not considered. Minor variations in this motive occur in the number of bands. Two or three may be the inner number. A second minor variation is the number and direction of the volutes. The standard motive has 10 volutes, 5 facing to the outside in each case. II. The paired serpents, tongue to tongue. The normal form of this motive is two S-shaped serpents, face to face with tongues touching. The serpent at the left normally has a double head, attached to the tail via a second band emanating from its head. The right-hand serpent has a short appendage behind the ear that terminates in a point. Both serpents extend a three — « fingered » hand at the same height. The tail of the right-hand serpent ends in a three-pronged outflip. That of the left-hand serpent combines with the second head to appear like another foot. Variations. The first variation is that the serpent bodies have no second head. The second variation shows the two figures on « all fours » or hori zontally disposed instead of vertically, again without tails. The third varia tion is with tongues joined or combined. The fourth variation shows the two serpents eating a head. III. The feather-enclosed knife.

In most cases the fourth motive appears to be a repetition of one of the others. As stated previously the basic rhythm of the vertical panels is up and down.

I. The up-moving figure, though presented with many variations, appears to be essentially the same animal, which we may liken to a dolphin. The basic attributes are a head, composed of an outjutting tongue, two rows Pl. 24 Detail of panel 11 south wall showing Motive III and II of three teeth each, a claw appendage extending from the right of the mouth, a nose, a pair of eyes (volute and ovoid), and what appears to be an ear emer ging from behind the left eye.

Variations. Most variation seems to be in the delineation of the dorsal side, where the fin at times becomes so involved in the body that it is diffi</page><page sequence="37">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 411 cult to identify the form. The most typical variation occurs on the west wall, where the ear is placed on the dorsal side and the claw moved to the left. II. The down-moving figure looks like nothing so much as what we should like to call a « sea cow ». It has a head, similar to the « dolphin ». Except that the claw and the ear are both on the animal's right side. The right side (which may be called ventral), is convex and terminates with a pair of in pointing three-toed feet. The dorsal side has a forepaw projecting at right angles and down near the anterior portion, and terminates in a volute tail. A variation has a serpent head projecting from the posterior part of the upper arm. Variations. The figure just described is consistently represented thus on the south wall. On the west wall, only minor variations are noted in his brief appearances. The ovoid and volute motives of the eyes are reversed, and the volute part of the claw descends from the animal's left jowl. The tail is also appended to the rear left (viewer's left). On the north wall, similar liberties are taken. The tail and forepaw are represented on the left. And the feet are on the rear. III. The third motive is a small, double-headed serpent. It has a very limited context. On the south wall, it appears always with a claw under neath the body. On the west wall, it seems to have an added paw and appears without claw both times that it occurs. In the frieze of the base wall of the main platform it occurs twice in succession, again with claw below. Its envi ronment is either in first position (lowest) or l-III, III-l. Motives that do not repeat. There are no obvious major motives that are nonrepetitive. Some of the minor variations listed may be independent nonrepetitive motives, but since they can in all cases be equally well-inter preted as variations, we have chosen the latter course. Framing Motives (F). There are three single panels of these on the west wall and three on the north wall. One framing panel, with an upper connec ting band, appears on the south base main platform wall, as does the same framing panel, with a shorter connecting band, on the adjoining west base main platform wall (south side). Traces of the same panel appear on the corresponding section of the north side wall. Single panels are found at the outer passage of the ramp and at the upper passage of the same, as well as at the left side adjoining the entrance of the inner entrance platform. The state of the various panels does not allow us to generalize on the standard form, though it would appear that for the exterior walls, main base and platform, three superimposed figures were normal (the possible exception, panel 1 of the north wall). The ramp panels were probably composed of two figures, and those of the entrance platform of one or two. The figures composing the framing panels are always the same, and vary only in direction. From top to bottom, the figure is composed of : A) A trailing headdress, with feathers. B) A face with eye outlined.</page><page sequence="38">412 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES Pl. 25 Processional figure framing the base wall, south side, western projection.

The Patterning of the Frieze Panels (fig. 4). The actual position and sequence of the extant panels has been described. We have also detailed the repertoire of basic motives on the two principal types of panels as well as variations and non-repetitive motives. With these in mind and a general knowledge of the extant structure of the temple and enclosure wall, we shall attempt an interpretation of the original plan of the friezes. The External Frieze. It will be noted first of all that the building elements which seem to indicate the direction of the frieze are the framing panels. All corners that are preserved have framing panels, but when these occur other than in this context we have reason to suspect that they mark direc tion. Thus, panels 13 and 15 of the west wall have the framing processional figures, facing to the central blank panel. There seems little reason to doubt that panel 14 had a special meaning, but we are unable to explain it. We attempted an excavation of the interior facing of the panel to determine if originally the wall was a doorway ; and we found no evidence for discon tinuity. In other words the blank panel was intentional. Possibly it was decorated for determined ceremonies and then « erased ». It may also have been hung with textiles or served as the backdrop for a scene that was enacted. If, however, we leave this problem, we may proceed to analyze the pa nels which precede this blank door to the left or north side from panel 12 to 1, and from 1 to the end of the north wall. Comparing this with the pa nels that lead into the blank center from the right, or south, side, i.e., panels 16 through 23, we can detect immediately a greater variation in the former and fairly consistent regularity in the latter. Let us omit for the moment the panels of the south side, since they fall on the other side of what most probably was the entrance to the temple and hence were less surely an integral part of the sequence of panels we are discussing. An analysis of the panels 12 to 1 shows that only panel 11 of the group has the five basic elements of the horizontal panel complete. The preceding horizontal panels, although oversized, not only lack one or another of the basic elements, but show a variation unique to them. This is true in general for the lower panels on the north wall, which gradually become less com plete as one moves from 3 to 21 (PI. 6, 7 a, 8, 9 a, 10). It is thus reasonable to suppose that the lower horizontal panels beginning with 21 on the north side and ending with 11 on the west side represent stages in the emergence of the full-blown panel of five principal motives. This is especially clear in the emergence of the « arc » motive 1, and the paired serpents enclosed within</page><page sequence="41">FRIEZÍ FRIEZf Interior Frieze! south woll o Exterior Frieze! west p Exterior Frieze! north</page><page sequence="42">EZE S all of the main platform -10 HH 12 Ll 3 -J— 14 LI5 J—16 H 7 J 18 M9-¡ 10 J—II—L12-1-13 —1— 14 —•— 15 J—16—LI7J— 18—LI9J—20—L21J—22—L23J gst perimeter wall 3—lie-1 ii—1101—9—L 8-1 th perimeter wall ^6J 5 L4J 3 L 2 —1J EZE S</page><page sequence="43">I- KltZI I- KltZl '-F ' 1 &gt;-Z-&gt; 3 Interior Frieze! south wall o 1 I-' 2 1 3 L4J 5 L6J 7 L8J 9 MO Exterior Frieze! west p L-22—1 21 L20J 19 LI8J 17 LI6^I5J 14 &gt;—13—&gt;-12 J— Exterior Frieze! north \ llJ—2 *-3-&gt; 4 '-S-1 6 L7-1 8 i-9-1 10 HI Exterior Frieze! south f</page><page sequence="44">tit b 11 all of the main platform sst perimeter wall th perimeter wall -10 L!M 12 *-13-"—14 LI5J—16 H 7 J 18 H9-I jth perimeter wall tit b</page><page sequence="45">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 415 it. Three basic changes in the composition occur between panels 21 north and 11 west. (1) The arc emerges from a low three-banded form to a full four-banded form with two heads at each terminus and two homunculi be neath. (2) The enclosed paired serpents, which are double-headed at the outset and placed horizontally, become single-headed, and gradually change to a vertical, « S-shaped » position. (3) Motive III, except for two miniature appearances in panels 3 and 5 (north wall), is not in the lower panel design until panel 9 (west wall), its place being taken by the larger representation (1.6 m.) of motive II, normally c. 1 meter. Against the « emergence » theory are the following inconsistencies : 1) The change from three to four bands in the arc occurs first at panel 5 west, but panel 7 drops to three bands. It is not clear if the rest of the panels up to 16 have 3 or 4 arcs, but from 16 on the four arc pattern is consistently represented. 2) The motive III, which is absent until panel 5 north, does appear here and again on 3, greatly reduced from its normal size, and it is absent again on the west side until panel 9, after which it appears consistently. It is not complete in panels 3 and 5 north, since the pedestral is missing, and only partly emerges in panel 9 west. While not contributing anything clearly to the « emergence » hypothesis, we must remark that panel 3 north and panels 3, 8 and 9 on the west wall present unique elements, which have been described. Of these no reasonable meaning can be deduced. The additional elements do not appear to be in relation to any missing motive. We should dismiss all but panel 9 for the present as only slightly aberrant (PI. 12 a). Panel 9 presents several problems. It is significant in the general pattern, since for the first time the homunculi appear on the lower panels. They appear in quite different forms, the one in motive V position being rather typical. But the one in IV position is composed of elements of the homunculus plus attributes of the processional figure. Between this figure and motive III is a bird, which is unique in the entire frieze. To the right of the homunculus is the upturned head of some animal also unique. Above the bird appears to be the leg and waistband tassel of yet another human figure, although this is less certain. The complex is difficult to interpret, but the scene may be an attempt to present the men, with the animals as attributes of their origin or clan. The vertical panels are patterned usually (19 out of 27) starting from the bottom, I-either II or III (Chart 1). All of the north wall panels begin with I, and those which show enough follow with III. No II motive is met until panels 17 and 19 on the west wall, where it underlies I. The only abnormality on the north and west wall, then, with regard to vertical panels occurs in panel 4, where the pattern is III-I. We can see no significant changes that might be correlated with the « emergence » interpretation. Summing up, the only possible explanation we can offer for the frieze sequence of the north and west walls is that the bottom sections of the hori</page><page sequence="46">416 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES zontal panels were successively integrated and enlarged from panel 21 on the north to the 11th panel on the west side, where a new direction was given to the frieze, emerging this time from panels 23 to 16. Within these last panels, very little change is noticeable. The most significant additions over panel 11, the most complete in the northern and western wall sequence, are the representation of motives VI and VII on panel 18. As noted before, panels 17 and 19 show vertical motive II. The incompleteness of the upper panels on the north wall makes corre lation of the upper panel changes with the lower next to impossible. Near the eastern end, it would appear that the upper panel is larger in general size, practically obliterating the lower, and that it proceeds to normal size toward the western end. The only unique motive in the upper panel is what appears to be a profile head (IX-H) in position IV of panel 9. It is possible that this is the same motive as on vertical panel 18. In general the upper panels maintain uniformity, with minor variations only. The Problems of the Southwest Corner Entrance. The most reasonable possibility for reconstructing the southwest corner rests upon the evidence of the west frieze wall. Since the blank panel marks a hypothetical center, to the left of which are 13 panels in this order (V, V, H, V, H,V,H, V, H, V, H, V, V) and to the right of which is an interrupted sequence of nine (V, H, V, H, V, H, V, H,V) presupposing a missing V panel after the first framing panel on this side, the balance number of 12 would be attained on the right side with an added sequence of H, V, V. By deriving the average of the width of the four H and four V panels (2.69 and . 60 me ters respectively) plus the average of the two framing panels (.67 meter), we arrive at a total extension length of 3.36 meters, which, if we added the vertical strip length variant of c. .20 meters for three panels gives us an approximate figure of 3,96 or 4 meters. The west wall probably terminated then, four meters beyond its present break, forming the gateway to the huaca. If the south wall simply extended to the corner, it would have an extension of 5,5 meters, which could have been occupied with a sequence of V, H, V, V. This would leave a plain gateway of 5,6 meters. A likely form of ter mination would be a corner block, at right angles to the terminus of the south wall. Aesthetically this would have to have at least the width of the south wall, or 2,4 meters. This would leave a gate space of 3,2 meters, which is reasonable. The south wall frieze cannot be integrally related to any other wall, se quence, because both extremes have been destroyed. In view of the like lihood that it terminated at the western end, however, it probably had a similar relationship to the east wall, that the west wall had to the north wall. This, of course, is pure speculation. Any other guess will stand about as well. It is obvious that, like the north wall, no internal break occurred in the center. The motives throughout are complete, more so than on any of the other walls. This may induce one to consider the south wall a conti nuation of the basic trend of development started with the north wall and</page><page sequence="47">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 417 continued to the west wall. While we have considered this valid for a long time, the need for explaining away the SW corner entrance (no other en trance is tenable), the intentional division of the west wall at approximate center, coupled with the general orientation of the huaca toward the west, wrest primary importance from the south wall as the culminating point of the friezes. The main variation on the south wall refers to the occurrence of motive VIII. It does not appear until panel 10, then reappears in panels 14, 16, and 18. Otherwise only minor variations within major motives differentiate the panels of the wall. The vertical panels are either in the pattern 1-11-111 (4 times) or occur once each as 11-111-11-1, 1-111-11-1, and 11-1. The panel pair 14 and 15 is the most complete of the huaca, the vertical one showing Ave principal motives and the horizontal one eight. The over-all patterning, like that of the north wall is V, H, V, H through out. Although it would be highly speculative, in order to give a rough idea of the probable original patterning of the friezes on the south walls, we have made an estimate based on the friezes preserved on both north and south walls, and assuming a standard patterning of V, V, H, V, H-V without major dimensional modifications. Thus it would turn out that each wall had a total of 31 panels made up of two framing panels one at each end, one extra V panel and 13 pairs of H and V panels. As noted before the pattern for the west wall is VVHVH, VHVHVHV, VHVHVH, VHVHVHVV, or a total of 26 panels, 11 horizontal and 15 verticals. The Interior Friezes. As in the case of the exterior friezes, the best guides for determining the direction of the interior friezes are the processional figures. On both the north and the south base walls of the main platform, these figures proceed toward the west uniformly until the turn. On the south side the same direction is continued but turned toward the center of the huaca until the partition wall, where its continuation is interrupted. As stated previously, there is no evidence to justify the interpretation that it continued past the partition wall toward the center and the evidence of broken frieze fragments in the area between the west section of the wall and the east ramp support, plus the continuation of the north frieze via a second right angle bend to the west and fronting the causeway and entrance platform wall, support the contention that originally the south wall frieze followed a right angle bend to the west whence it either joined with the base of the ramp or ter minated in a possible door to the room. The east base wall of the main plat form as well as the west wall of the entrance platform did not carry frieze decoration. The most probable interpretation then for the interior is that the begin ning of the sequence is at the eastern end of the south base wall, that it pro ceeds the length of the wall, turns north, then west again past the destroyed room to join with the base of the ramp. From the ramp the sequence is simple enough, following the basic form of the incline on both sides, past the two gates to the entrance platform. The explanation just offered, i.e., of conti</page><page sequence="48">418 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES nuity between the west-moving frieze of the south interior with the ramp, presents the problem of isolating the entire north side frieze. The difficulty, aesthetically unpalatable, may be resolved by interpreting the south-side projection as terminating before juncture with the ramp, thus relegating both frieze sections to essentially decorative categories. Evidence is equally good for either interpretation. The vacuity of the west wall of the entrance platform precludes any possibility of a double processional frieze joining at the ramp. The patterning of the interior panels follows the alternating H-V pattern but the corners show an F-H-V pattern exterior. The uniqueness of the in terior patterning also lies in the use of the horizontal framing band to seal off horizontally as well as vertically the H-V sections. It is conceivable that the terrace friezes were considered as the upper panel counterparts to the base wall friezes, since in most cases they correspond and follow on a higher level the base platform wall. This interpretation presents the basic objec tion that terrace friezes also occur on the exterior entrance platform and on the terrace of the east main platform, but no friezes adorn either base wall. The ramp friezes demonstrate the interesting use of a special panel for the gates. As nearly as can be determined by the fragmentary state of the ramp, processional figures occupy all the panels at the corners. The friezes of the entrance platform appear to maintain a patterning si milar to the F-H-V sequence already described for other parts, but there were apparently unique elements, to judge by the fragments found. The fragmentary panels to the right and left of the entrance of the entrance plat form show figures proceeding away from the gate ; unfortunately no other processional figure could be reconstructed on the other wall sections to in dicate if the direction had changed in the north inside wall. The reconstruction of the entrance platform depends upon (1) the present remains and hypothetical extensions of the boundary walls, (2) the frag ments of frieze decoration recovered from the adjacent destroyed portion, and (3) the reconstruction of the causeway. The actual dimensions of the internal entrance platform are 7 meters at the west wall, and for the south a sequence of 1.8 meters for the western extensions, door space of 1.6 meters and eastward extension to the break of 2 meters. The north wall is 5 meters long to the break. It is thus clear that the gate is not equidistant to the cor ners enclosing the entrance platform, but closer to the western end. If we hypotheticate a frieze pattern for the north wall on the basis of the extant fragment of the horizontal panel, we would need at least a framing panel at the corner, preceding it, and a vertical and terminating framing panel at the right. This combination would run to c. 5.20 m. for a minimal width to the entrance platform. This is the only dimension we can, with any reasonable logic, reconstruct. The possible extension of the entrance platform past what we have termed the causeway area, to join with the main platform is tenable, as are a number of possible intermediate varia tions. Of these, the more probable would be a closure of the entrance plat</page><page sequence="49">THE HUACAÏEL DRAGÓN 419 form connecting friezelined passage, and an opening to a wide main plat form area. Returning to the entrance platform, we must face the problem of the « break » or door which occurs roughly midway along the west wall. It is 3.2 meters from both corners and .50 cm wide. The extant condition of the facing at the break is so weathered and battered that it is impossible to determine whether the break was at one time covered with plaster (« en lucida ») or a real door. In view of its key position (highest central point on the west wall) it is important to consider whether this space was open or occupied by a panel. To support the theory that it was open, there is the structural argument that such a door allows communication to the west wall external terrace, which if closed on its southern terminus, communi cates with the terrace lining the north external wall of the entrance plat form. Supporting the possibility that a panel was in the space, is the evidence from the head fragment discovered a short distance from the break. This head, which is unusually large and thick, and represents the only front face human head in the entire frieze repertoire, must have had a special posi tion (fig. 3). The vacant space may have been such a location. Unfortuna tely no other fragment was found that would logically form part of the body of this figure. It is conceivable that the head may even have served as part of a lintel crowning the doorway, or that it was atop another segment of the frieze now destroyed. We have considered the hypothetical extensions of the extant boundary walls of the entrance platform. In order to define the possible eastward ex tension and the adjoining causeway area, it will be necessary to examine the evidence of the frieze fragments in the area and the structural possibi lities of the causeway zone (Chart 2). In the entrance platform itself, we cleared the area in lateral strips of a meter in width. Thus from south to north the platform can be divided into sections A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. The to tal number of fragments found on the platform was 324. Logically enough the greatest number was found in sections A and G, since they included fragments from the south and north walls respectively, while sections B to F presum ably included only fragments from the west wall. All fragments were either yellow, white, or natural color. With the exception of two fragments in sec tion F, these conform to the vertical and horizontal repetitive motives. Letter G shows, for example, part of horizontal panel, motive 11, and the only in situ panel is part of motive 1. From the calculations on broken fragments before the three walls of the internal platform, it is possible to derive a minimum height of 1.78 for the north section, 1.52 for the west, and 1.19 for the south wall. The portada (gateway) can be heightened .22 meters by similar calculations. While these calculations are below the actual figure, since it is unlikely all fragments are still there, they give a rough idea of the probable height of the upper walls, a figure which is in keeping with the capacities of the wall width. They also indicate that probably no internal panel was doubled.</page><page sequence="50">420 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES The Causeway. This area to judge by the debris was floored in approxi mately the same level as the entrance platform and was once lined with friezes. In this area a total of 225 fragments were found, which could cover an area of 2 1 /4 square meters. Thus it is likely that the frieze of the entrance platform extended eastward. All but nine fragments are either base color, yellow or white. The occurrence of six fragments of red and three of green indicates an unusual feature in the frieze, which we interpret later on to be sections of a roof cornice. The possibility that some of the fragments may correspond to lost sections of the terrace which may have lined the exterior of the causeway is supported by the remains of roofing which were mixed in this debris and which otherwise are associated with the terrace. With this meagre evidence, we can only propose the likely reconstruction of a causeway that followed the main base walls, lined within with friezes and bordered on the outside with the terrace on either side. In order to complete the reconstruction of the frieze section, we have only to consider the terrace decoration and the possible interrelation of the terrace to the causeway and upper platform (Plan 2). The terrace, to sin thesize what has already been mentioned, is a narrow strip that forms the last « step » of the main structure, dividing the base section of cells and outer wall from the top section of platform with its hypothetical component struc tures. It is, in its present state, composed of three sections which were pro bably united in the original construction of the huaca. These are : the eastern and northern sides, the western side with adjoining north section, and the southern side. The eastern-northern section starts at the corner where the main upper wall comes flush to the inner corner of room 5. It maintains a uniform width of . 80 meter until its termination-break at the South-eastern corner of room 14, where it widens, following the width of the base wall and abruptly terminates with the abuttment block, added after the structure was built (PI. 3). The height of the terrace along this trajectory is 5.0 m. to 4.9 m. The wall height of the flanking friezes on the east wall fluctuates between c. 40 and 60 centimeters, rises to a maximum of 1.60 meters on the north wall in certain well-preserved parts. It probably was of uniform height. The northwest section begins at the break of the north exterior wall of the entrance platform continues to the corner, proceeds c. 5 meters along the exterior of the west wall, where it terminates in the point of downward des cent of the west ramp support. It has a uniform width of 60 cm. The wall height above it varies from 2 meters along the north wall to 1.5 on the west. Terrace height is 5.3 meters. The south section runs from the other termi nation of the upper wall in room 5 to the end of room 1, where its continua tion is obscure. It has a width of .80 cm. and the maximum height of the wall flanking it is 2.40 m. From the foregoing it is clear that the terrace quite possibly at its original construction was a uniform band encircling the huaca, beginning somewhere near the east ramp support, bordering the area of the large room or perhaps the south exterior wall of the presumed causeway, continuing to join with</page><page sequence="51">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 421 the south section, passing the upper wall projection of the southeast corner to unite with the eastern-northern section, crowning the now broken bends of the north base wall to join with the northern-western section and termi nate at the present point of juncture with the exterior wall of the west ramp support. In its trajectory, it would have narrowed some 20 cm. in width and increased c. 80 cm. in height. At all points it would have been flanked by friezes approximately 2 meters high. If this were its original state, we would still have the problem of explain ing its communication to the interior of the main platform. There are two structural solutions which are probable : via doorways through the terrace walls or via openings in the causeway area. A third possible solution is, of course, both. The evidence for a door on the west wall has been discussed. Similar evidence exists for doorways on the south, east, and north walls flanking the terrace. In no case is the conservation of the « breaks » clear enough to justify our reconstruction. The cumulative gross evidence of the present state of the upper platform with masses of adobes forming « tur rets » at the corners and low breaks in relatively narrow walls at the median portions, makes the interpretation of doorways probable, but this state of affairs can also be explained by the manner in which the huaca was system atically plundered in Colonial times. While the main breaks occurred at the northwest and southwest corners, smaller wall breaks were doubtless made or at least widened in the intermediate areas to facilitate disposing of the debris. In our opinion either interpretation is equally tenable. The question of an entrance from terrace to interior is almost entirely relegated to the realm of conjecture, since the causeway is so completely broken. Examining the south side of the causeway, we can be fairly sure the east ramp support did not support the terrace, since the wall (though without its « enlucida ») is typical of the inner wall facings of the cells and shows no trace of a high support sufficient for a terrace. Thus the terrace, if it existed, had to be borne by the main wall of the causeway, the state of which is such as to preclude any reconstruction. Its base width could support a terrace, but at the height where the terrace would begin, it is des troyed. The mass behind room tends to support the theory that the ter race was blocked off here in a manner similar to the northwest corner, behind room 14. On the north side, the extant wall heights are so low that no evi dence on terrace extensions is deducible. We can only remark that without the intrusive block of the alteration, the terrace was continuous to a join ing with the causeway, and this could be a logical place for a doorway. Turning to the friezes themselves, we find little to aid us in reconstructing the direction of the terrace wall. The extant panels show fragments of the same horizontal and vertical panels general throughout the huaca. The most complete fragment is a section of parts of three panels on the western end of the exterior of the entrance platform (Chart 1). They consist of, starting from the NW corner, space for one vertical panel (probably a framing one), a horizontal panel with portions of motives I, II, III, and IV in recognizable 9</page><page sequence="52">422 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES form, a vertical panel, and the beginning of a horizontal panel (pattern : F-H-Y-H). This section at least permits us to logically extend the terrace further east. The other fragments are too small and battered to warrant reconstruction. The fragments of friezes which were found in the debris of point 7 (what remained of the missing room) and rooms 1, 2, and 3, all may be construed as having fallen from the terrace friezes (Chart 2). Of the 140 fragments from rooms 1, 2, and 3, 54 are natural background color, 5 are yellow, 55 are white. This small proportion of fragments in yellow contrasts to the frag ments found on the floor of the entrance platform (121 yellow to 21 white), the ramp (38 yellow, no white), and point 12, the causeway area immedia tely next to the entrance platform (17 yellow and 2 white). It will be noted, however, that precisely in those points where roofing is indicated, the white fragments predominate, while where roofing is absent, white fragments are scarce. In these same areas fragments of friezes of other colors (red and green) are found. We offer the explanation, therefore, that the fallen fragments correspond to the terrace friezes in the zones immediately above them and that the friezes were topped by a roof which had a frieze cornice. This cornice was probably of a base color white with red and green motives. The extent of the roof can be traced fairly well above rooms 1, 2, and 3. It is less clear for rooms 4 and 5 and 10 and 11. It appears to have existed over the cause way area, probably, as we have suggested shadowing the hypothetical exter ior terrace. The only reasonable way we can explain the roofing over the terrace friezes is by the use of vertical frame supports located at the point where the strips between panels occur, thus avoiding the obstruction of the view. Whether the terrace wall itself, or the ledge, formed the base wall of the rooms, we cannot say, but the extant material would tend to justify the terrace wall as the base. This would make passage between the roof sup ports and the terrace narrow indeed, but some 80 centimeters would be ade quate for the passage of a normal person. On the northern-eastern section of the terrace, where the terrace width is only 60 centimeters, no roofing is evident. Summary. The foregoing has been of necessity a combination of frieze description and reconstruction of the three upper units of the huaca, the entrance plat form, causeway and main platform with the exterior terrace that bounds them. This procedure has been necessary to bring us to the point of discus sing the interrelation of the upper friezes with those which we have followed on the exterior and the base wall and ramp of the interior walls. Two pos sible solutions are now offered. Either the in-facing friezes formed a dis parate unit, beginning with those of the entrance platform and terminating in some sort of court over the main platform, with or without communi cating passages to the terrace ; or the processional sense was maintained, and there existed a communicating passage from the termination of the</page><page sequence="53">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 423 friezes on the entrance platform or causeway to the probable inception point on the south side of the causeway. In this case, a re-entrance point on the north side of the causeway would be likely too. This second possibility would leave the north eastern terrace section as purely decorative (unless we accept the existence of the central western doorway, which would be in this case the re-entrance door). Sr. Rodriguez S. suggested that there might have been two separate entrances, one to the terrace and one via the ramp, but unless such an entrance be hypothecated for the room area adjoining the south side of the causeway, no second ramp is defendable. The interpreta tion of a « processional walk » is ruled out, at least in the final alteration of the huaca, by the closure of the terrace on the southeast and northwest cor ners. It is thus most probable that the exterior terrace frieze was essentially decorative, and that the processional aspect terminated with the interior walls. The structure, actual and hypothetical, of the huaca has been described, and the friezes have been described and reconstructed. Insofar as possible we have indicated their interrelationships with each other and with the struc ture of the huaca. We shall return to a non-structural consideration of the function of the edifice after an examination of the contents of the clearing and excavation. V. THE CONTENTS AND THEIR CONTEXTS Contexts. In no part of the excavation or clearing of the huaca did we encounter stratigraphy. We did, however, note three classes of contexts which are of importance in interpreting the significance of the finds as well as estimating the changes that took place in the occupation and use of the structure. 1) Undisturbed. This context applies to the condition of the huaca when it was abandoned or ceased to be maintained in its original forms. As noted previously, very few points were found that provided this ideal context. They were : the first 15 centimeters of the northwest section of cell 11, con taining the deposits of strombus, spondylus and nectandra seeds (PI. 26 b) : the area immediately adjacent to the exterior walls (north, west and south) below the lowest rain or flood cap (sand lens) ; small areas immediately adjacent and below the broken floor of the entrance platform, especially in points 9D and 9G ; and similar spots in front of and below the broken ramp floor within point 8. 2) Once Disturbed. This context applies to material which was moved from its original (presumably context 1) location during a large scale sacking of the edifice, either in Colonial or prehistoric times. This context is demon strable at point 5 and by analogy at cells 11 (above the context 1 material)</page><page sequence="54">424 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES and 10, and at the ramp proper (points 10 and 11) as well as the western portions of 9. 3) Redisturbed. This applies to all other contexts, and it indicates at least two recent despoilings of the huaca that can be documented ; one shortly before 1943, a six months treasure-hunting enterprise ; and the other a se ries of intermittent destructions of the area from the southwest corner, through the southwest part of the corridor and room, point 7, to the causeway and core of the main platform. The Undisturbed Context. As we have noted in the section on the friezes, the area immediately adjacent to the friezes below the unpenetrated sand lens, revealed the low reliefs in their pristine colors, a condition which could not have existed had the walls been exposed to one of the periodic rains (c. fifty years interval) that are a climatological phenomenon of the north coast. This means that the temple had its external friezes intact and in their proper colors at the time it was abandoned ; and a process of sand drift ac cumulated varying from c. 2.5 meters on the south to c. 20 cms. on the north wall, which covered the base of the friezes before the next subsequent rains hardened, but did not penetrate a sand cap. Finds in this narrow area were fragments of common type textiles, some spondylus and strombus and large stones. In the undisturbed floor section of cell 11, a series of three deposits were found : 1) 24 strombus, some of which showed traces of having been wrap ped in textiles, 2) 15 spondyllus closed, and 3) three heaps of nectandra seeds. Sealed off by a heavy hard parked flood cap were the rest of the artifacts and bones found in the cell. At point 9D, below the broken floor, we found the partly broken-into tomb of a child. The adobes on top had been partially removed, and the burial had apparently been « probed » for offerings at the body level, but the material had not been removed. The body was apparently lying on its side with the head towards the west. Immediately adjacent to it were the following offerings : 10 spondylus, 10 strombus, beads of a collar of nec tandra, which was apparently around the child's neck at the time of the burial. One of the spondylus was tied up with thread. Some fragments of the loose, fine type white and brown textile were with the body. The tomb was made out of the adobes supporting the floor of the entrance platform, two courses of adobes below the floor level. It was approximately square. This burial is of the same type as that described by Uhle on the platform of the huaca del Sol (Uhle : fig. 14). At point 9G, immediately below a section of frieze representing part of motive 1, horizontal panel, and four courses of adobes down, was found a bundle of cloth with several small collars of nectandra seeds. No disturbed burial was sufficiently close to indicate that this offering pertained to it. This summary of the only undisturbed contextual finds leads to the con clusion that the huaca was abandoned while the friezes were still intact and</page><page sequence="55">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 425 in good repair, that deposits of spondylus, strombus and nectandra were kept there and that they were used as offerings or charms. The Secondary Context. In view of the almost negligible evidence in con text 1 and hence the importance of context 2 for interpreting the function of the huaca, we are obliged to seek to extract more information from the latter than would otherwise be necessary. Most useful for our purposes are the two cells, 10 and 11, and point 5, the corridor corner immediately out side room 14. At the latter point the conditions under which we found the large cache of wooden idols were the following (Schaedel : 1951C) : a mass of human bones, some bleached, were mixed with eleven complete idols of wood in an area c. one meter by 1 /2 meter. They were covered by a hard packed flood cap over which we could trace four successive caps which left marks on the adjoining wall. The two factors of 5 flood caps (calculated time between each of 50 years) and the leaving of currently negotiable arti facts lead us to conclude that the latest the material had been disturbed was during the Colonial period. A third contributing factor is the bleached con dition of some of the bones, which indicates that they had been exposed for some time. This in turn suggests a large scale « light of day » excavation that was rare in post-Colonial times. Even admitting as highly probable the Colonial age, it is possible to attri bute the sacking to an even earlier period. The factors leading to this hypo thesis are : 1) the bones, though badly scattered and broken are heaped in a special place and so to speak « reburied » with a group of what might be considered « protective divinities », the idols. This is not likely behavior for a Spanish treasure seeker, but could be explained as overtime voluntary effort on the part of his native workmen. 2) No European type artifact was found in the debris. 3) The flood caps are useful only in giving a minimal period of time elapsed, since they are of varying degrees of intensity ; thus a late heavy rain may break through previous caps and destroy the traces of rains immediately preceding it. Whoever were responsible for this pillaging on the north side, it is neces sary to note that they « attacked » the causeway and main platform, using the corridor area and the rooms for vacating the debris. The immediate area near point 5 was thoroughly searched for more remains of idols, but it was clearly a special zone, and the rest of the corridor that we checked was filled only with adobes and adobe fragments. From where did the idols originally come ? The original context could be either cell 14 or some part of the main causeway. We think it rather likely, however, in view of the distributional evidence from the entire excavation, that they came from the cell. The vast number of bones, however, is not to be expected on gene ral distributional grounds in a single cell. Furthermore, as we noted, a num ber of them were bleached. It is possible therefore, to suppose that for one reason or another (perhaps to strip the cadavers of any metal) a special way station was set up at this point, and that the idols with some of the cada vers were exhumed from the adjoining cell 41. Unfortunately, we were unable</page><page sequence="56">426 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES to clear cell 14, because of the inadequate space for vacating debris, and some future clearing may lend the necessary corroborative evidence for this interpretation (e.g. by finding the rest of the typical residue of artifacts found in rooms 10 and 11). Rooms 10 and 11 show much the same contextual condition as point 5. Again a number of negotiable artifacts were left in a heap (remains of fifteen wooden idols, small metallic ornaments and ornamental textiles) ; the com plex was covered by a heavy hard packed rain cap, and no remains of recent probing were noted. Since these rooms were rooms off the main route of evacuation of debris it is reasonable to suppose that fewer contents from the upper platform were mixed in, and that the mode of pillage was one of using one room as the dumping point for the adjoining one (intervening partition walls are lower than the exterior wall). The finds in these two rooms include : wooden idols, shell inlay, metal ornaments, shell beads, large num bers of cut shell fragments, utilitarian pottery, wooden tools, textiles and the bones of perhaps 7-8 individuals. We should note two factors here in eva luating the reliability of once disturbed context as represented by rooms 10 and 11. 1) The combination of three classes of ceremonial artifacts in high pro portions (otherwise of highly sporadic occurrence in Peruvian, prehistoric sites so far known) ; wooden idols, shell beads and inlay, and metal ornaments. 2) The fact that the nonceremonial artifacts are generally tools or uten sils or the same classes of artifacts in various states of manufacture. The artifacts of context 2, point 5 supplement the wooden idol classes The linkage between contexts 1 and 2 may be established by the finds of nectandra, which would form a fourth main class of ceremonial artifacts particular to this huaca. In context one, we have the finished products, the beads in collar form, and in context 2 the deposits from which the beads were selected and strung. Similar linkage is established by the spondylus and strombus shells, used in deposits or as offerings in context 1, and in the stage of manufacture as beads and inlay in context 2. The linkage between contexts 1 and 2 is further strengthened by the con dition of the ramp as compared with the context 1 portion of the exterior walls. The ramp, in its preserved sections, contained no extraneous artifacts except 6 fragments of ceramics. It too, except for the base portion, was off the main course of the line of « evacuation ». Hence, though it may have been battered in during the first pillage, it was not used for dumping. As a result, like the undisturbed portions of the exterior walls, it indicates what one would expect along a processional passageway, a rather well swept sur face. We propose therefore that the state of cell 11 is at least sufficiently a va lid context to serve as a basis for interpreting the original contents of the cells. We shall demonstrate how the distribution of the contents in the other cells of redisturbed context supports our contention. The most reasonable</page><page sequence="57">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 427 alternative hypothesis for interpreting the context 2 materials is that they are funerary offerings either from burials above the cells, in the cells them selves, or both. The strongest argument to support this possibility is the high content of human bones in point 5 and cells 10 and 11. Against this, as we shall demonstrate later, is the general distribution of all the contents in the huaca in which the intrusive elements (which relate to a reuse of the huaca) can bé for the most part isolated. Context 3. Redisturbed. This context has obviously slight value, but as in the case of context 2, we are obliged to analyze it for at least « probable » validity where possible. One of the methods used was quantitative. We show on the adjoining distributional chart (Chart 3) how the classes of artifacts tend to cluster in certain zones, thus indicating grosso modo the probable general context of any class of artifacts. Another process used was to verify by our own observation and clearing the verbal statements of Sr. Neira, who conducted the large-scale treasure-hunt c. 1942. We were thus able to reconstruct up to a certain point how the material was moved about, and at least to establish the limits within which it could have been disturbed. We may here give a rough summary of the relative validity of the point components of this class of contexts. Chart 3. Cells 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. Material may have been moved from one cell to another via tunnels, rarely, over the partition walls, but slight probability that any more intrusive material exists than in cells 10 and 11. The overhead sections of cells 1, 2 and 3 were almost in context 2 condition. The basic deficiencies in these cells are their incompleteness, since Sr. Neira left few negotiable artifacts behind for us, and cell 6 was only partially cleared (PI. 26 and 27). Hypothetical Room, 7. This area was in the worst contextual condition, since it had already been pillaged by Neira and was in the process of being resacked and used as a relay point for workmen dismantling the south wall of the cau seway and the core. Artifacts here may have been originally in the upper plat form, the supposed room space, or in some unknown context above the main platform. Corridor area 8. Like 7, this point was a relay point and includes material that may have been on the ramp, and in the points mentioned for 7. Most of the debris was concentrated between the space in front of 7, and the broken base of the ramp. Entrance Platform 9. All except the points mentioned and a short strip of the western periphery represent remains of disturbed burials within the top courses of the platform as well as frieze fragments from the walls that line it. The context is valid for interpreting the final condition of the entrance platform. Points 12, 13 and 14. Causeway area. Very disturbed, containing a large amount of material that fell from the entrance platform and presumably the surface of the causeway and main platform as well as from burials in the walls of same. Some possibility exists that 14 may contain a few remains from 7. 1-2-3. The disturbed portions of 1 and 3 probably refer to material removed via the Point 7-8 route, but some of 3 material may have been tunneled out</page><page sequence="58">428 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES and forgotten by Neira from cells 1-5. Point 3 material represents a blend of sur face deposition and probably original final deposition. Point 4. A general area in front of the cells 1-5, probably material from the terrace and cells in that strip. The contexts have now been evaluated and defined. It will be necessary to present the classes of artifacts found and to assess the significance of their distribution in the huaca before taking up the question of the several phases of occupation and /or use. Ceramics. 638 sherds and no complete pots were found in the course of the clearing and excavation. Chart 4 shows the distribution of the wares. The two ma jor types of ceramics found were : 1) smoothed black, a reduced fired ware with smoothed exterior surface, occasionally decorated with relief ; 2) smooth ed plain, an oxidized fired ware with the same surface treatment but lack ing relief and showing instead occasional paddle mark and groove deco ration. These two wares form the basic ceramic complex of the huaca. The following list shows the total wares and their respective percentages. Smoothed black Smoothed plain Polished black Grit-tempered black . White /red Chancay black /white. Sandy plain Polished orange Brown Unclassified Black white /orange . . 322 183 66 27 8 8 4 3 3 3 1 638 52.104 % 28.714 10.346 4.224 1.242 1.242 .614 .457 .457 .457 .143 100.000 % The ceramic complex, then, poses a problem that will be presented re peatedly as we describe the other contents : what are the ceramic components which correspond to the original occupation of the huaca ? Two lines of evidence have been applied to isolating out this group of components : asso ciation with paint, which can be shown to have been used on the friezes ; and segregation by context 2. In the first process, one fragment of smoothed orange, 16 fragments of smoothed black and 18 fragments of polished black (plain) were isolated. By the association with context 2, the following com ponents result :</page><page sequence="59">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 429 Number of Sherds 50 31 (82) 1 56 14 (74) 4 3 (4) 1 2 (3) 1 Ware Smoothed black » » Smoothed plain » » Polished black (plain) » Polished orange Percent in Context 2 of Total Sherds 25 % 40 % 6 % 100 % This chart reveals the core of the ceramic types associated with the original occupation of the huaca. In addition, smooth and polished black sherds were found in association with painting and presumably are to be dated to the painting of the huaca. Thus, on distributional grounds and by associa tion with the friezes we should list the following types as the ceramic com ponents of the original occupation of the huaca : smoothed black, polished black, smoothed plain and polished orange. The following types then can be tentatively considered « intrusive » and presumably later : grit-tempered black, white /red, Chancay black /white, sandy plain, brown, and Inca. The Principal Occupation Period : Tiahuanacoid III/Moche (fig. 5 and 6). On the basis of analogies to dated ceramics from the Moche and adjoining Virú and Ghicama valleys, the best match-up with the components from the original occupation of the huaca is with what I have termed « Tiahua nacoid III/huaca de la Cruz (Schaedel : 1959 : 40), and which corresponds to the Middle Moche IIC of Bennett (1939 : 140-142) as clarified for the three valleys by Collier (1955 : 121-124). In terms of total percentages of reduced as contrasted with oxidized fired wares, the context 2 percentage is lower (53 %) than the lot 2 material from the huaca del Sol (70 %) in Moche, and lower than Bennett's huaca de la Cruz burials (62 %) and than Willey's V-142 graveyard (71 %) in "Virú. It is higher than the Middle Tomaval (Tiahuanacoid II/Viru) percentages for Taitacantin (44 and 42 %) and huaca Larga (25 %), all in Virú, and for the Pata de Burro burials (21 %) in the Chicama, which are considered by Collier to be late Early Tomaval (Tia huanacoid I). The fit would be closer if we could assume most of the smoo ther blackware in context 3 as pertaining to the original occupation as well. Even without this addition, however, on the basis of ratio of reduced to oxidized fired wares, the assignment to Tiahuanacoid III is the most rea</page><page sequence="60">SMOOTHED BLACK 1 X : SMOOTHED BLACK Fig. 5 a, b and c : water jars ; d and h : open storage jars ; e : bowl for painting ; / and g : bowls.

In terms of the specific type analogies of the wares, there is a close simi larity in paste and surface treatment between the Virú valley Tomaval plain and Gloria plain and the smoothed black and smoothed plain of the huaca El Dragón. The polished black (Chimu) ware which was typed by the Virú expedition as San Juan molded (pressed ware type) and Queneto polished plain (for the undecorated) has a period spanning the Tomaval and the La Plata periods. In the Moche valley, there is a fairly clear type distinction between the highly burnished metallic Chimu pressed ware and the less polished, cruder Tiahuanacoid (San Juan molded) of which we found only two sherds. The pressed ware from the huaca is almost all Chimu, and we have assigned it, together with the polished black plate forms that are cha racteristic of Chan Chan burial offerings, to the Chimu period component of the polished blackware. The remainder of the polished blackware, which includes the non-Chimu forms of ribbon-handled pitcher and painting bowl, are considered to be Tiahuanacoid in time (fig. 7). One of the three sherds of polished orange, which forms the only other component of the huaca, is characterized by the pierced node at the neck of a jar which is a Tomaval (Tiahuanacoid period) hallmark, even though the ware does not appear in other published Tiahuanacoid III contexts (Wil ley : 1947 : 45-46). With respect to specific modes of decoration, the paddle marked decora tion on the smoothed plain is datable to the late Tiahuanacoid I phase in the Chicama (Pata de Burro) and to the Tiahuanacoid III (Late Tomaval) phase in Virú at huaca de la Cruz. The design of the Lot 2 material from huaca del Sol in the Moche which Collier puts in Tiahuanacoid III shows stylistic resemblances to the frieze of the huaca El Dragón with double headed serpents and « kissing » figures (Kroeber : 1925 : pis. 64, e, j ; 64, d). The black-white-red ware of late Tiahuanacoid times did not appear in the huaca El Dragón sherd material or from nearby cemeteries, although it is a diagnostic strain in the Virú-Moche-Chicama valleys. We should note, however, that it was found in very low percentages in both the V-142 and Lot 2 excavations. The ceramics found in the huaca for the Tiahuanacoid period are basi cally bowls, open storage jars, collared storage jars, water jars and ollas ; the latter show remains of having been in a fire. The storage jar fragments were found in large quantities in cells 10 and 11, while the paint pots (bowls) were found along with other evidences of retouching in the area of the en trance platform, base of the frieze and exterior walls. Although some fifty sherds showed traces of having been over a fire, no hearth within the huaca or its immediate periphery could be found despite diligent searching ; nor were refuse deposits found in the vicinity. The paucity of vegetal and fau nal remains substantiates the likelihood that the huaca was occupied inter mittently for short periods, rather than constantly.</page><page sequence="63">o &lt;t o ¡\ a&gt; o Vi lO tfü - CT&gt; o "O 1 i\ a&gt; lO o CT&gt; Fig. 7 a : ribbon-handled pitcher ; b : bowl for painting ; c : shallow bowl ; d, e and f : plates ; g, h, and i : Chimu pressedware decoration. a, b and c are Tiahuanacoid forms ; d, e and / are Chimu.</page><page sequence="64">434 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES Intrusive Wares. Of the wares considered to be indicative of periods subsequent to the ori ginal occupation of the huaca, the context 3 polished black relates clearly to Chimu, and we attribute the decorated sherds and plates to intrusive burials. The few white /red sherds correspond to a Chimu strain, although they could be somewhat earlier, and the Chancay sherds are probably trade pieces contemporaneous in time, which should also be assigned here. The Inca-associated component is made up of a polychrome and grit tempered blackware identical in paste to Estero plain in Virú (fig. 8). Their contextual association in « room » 7 and the southwest corner, where the intrusive stone wall was uncovered, lend credence to the supposition that the alteration of this section was done during Incaic times when the huaca may have been used as a watchtower. The few sherds of brownware, sandy plain and unclassified could not be given a specific period affiliation, although it is likely that they pertain to the later periods. Including the intrusive components, only 13 % of the pottery may be described as non-utilitarian. Although two partially restorable Chimu pieces were found in context 3 association, these and the few sherds of decorated polished black indicate that few pottery grave offerings were deposited in the huaca. The Shells and Shell Artifacts. A total of 1,563 pieces of shell (mostly strombus and spondylus) was found in the huaca in every form, from a shell to a finished bead or object of inlay. As with the concentration of wooden idols, this is to my knowledge by far the densest accumulation of shell so far encountered in archaeological in vestigations in Peru. Fortunately, our contextual background for the shell finds is adequate to assign them to the original occupation and use of the huaca. As noted previously, context one (cell 11) indicates that both shell types were accumulated and deposited in at least one of the cells. Context 2 indicates that they were cut and worked in the same or adjoining cells into one of two classes of artifacts, « beads » or « pendants » and inlay (presu mably for the wooden idols). A group of 35 mother-of-pearl artifacts found in cells 10 and 11 complete the shell inventory. While it cannot be demons trated that the inlay was made in the huaca, there seems little doubt but that the ovoid and rectangular pendants or beads were, since they are found at all stages of manufacture and in great quantities. For this reason, in the general distribution chart (Chart 5) shell mate rial is classified in three, and in a certain sense, four categories. The raw material, the shell or valve is considered as possibly funerary when out of context, and as a deposit in context 1. The unfinished cut shell or the frag ments of such cutting is considered as material related to a workshop use of the huaca, namely the preparation of shell beads or pendants. The com pleted pieces are considered in two roughly comparable categories related</page><page sequence="65">§ \ o \ Fig. 8 a : collared storage jar ; b, c and d : relief designs.</page><page sequence="66">436 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES to ceremonial use of the huaca, the inlay (which conceivably was manufac tured elsewhere) and the finished beads which were manufactured in the huaca. The distribution chart supports the basic evidence of context 1 (9G) to indicate that our interpretation of complete shells found in redisturbed con text probably relates to burials in the platform. The context 1 situation is important in demonstrating the actual significance of the huaca as regards shell material and explains in part the curious burial offerings in the entrance platform burial. It will be noted on the chart also that cut shell and fragments were found only in the cells or in points along the main « south route of evacuation » (points 7, 4, 8, 1, 3). The overwhelmingly greater concentration of the cut shell and fragments in cells 10 and 11, as contrasted with cells 1-6, may in dicate that the former were the workshops, and that the latter may have had somewhat different special functions. Only the complete clearing of all the rooms can shed more light on this problem. Similarly, the only completed « beads » found (fig. 9) in the area outside of the cells were along the main route of evacuation. The beads are generally of two main types, ovoid (from strombus) and rectangular (from spondylus). They seem to conform to rather standard measurements, so that we have considered them probably « beads » of a collar, but other interpretations, such as counters or means of exchange, are tenable for the spondylus. The inlay group, including the mother-of-pearl fragments, follows the same general distribution as the shell artifacts mentioned. Most of the pieces can be identified as pertaining to one or another decorated idol, so that these pieces may well have fallen out during the original pillage. In summary then, the distributional chart affords corroboratory evidence for assigning the cut shell fragments, beads and inlay to the original huaca complex. The complete shells with redisturbed context may pertain to the original occupation or to intrusive burials. Wooden Artifacts. This class of artifacts can be readily subdivided into wood sculpture (here referred to as idols), tools and a miscellaneous category (including artifacts that occur but once) and ill-defined fragments. Wood Sculpture. Although idols were carved from either a hard (algar roba) or a soft balsa-like wood, the typology of the idols is best expressed by using position and shape as the main criteria. As complete idols have been described in Schaedel (1951 : 16-21), it will only be necessary to illus trate the fragments (fig. 10). In terms of context, it can readily be seen that the context 3 materials differ from context 2 material only in being more fragmentary (Chart 6), which is to be expected. Of the specimens in context 2, it should be pointed out that there is overlap (again to be expected from the probable pillage technique) between cells 10 and 11.

This may indicate again dis tinct functions for the different cells. The tools found are of three types : flat, cylindrical and cylindrical tape ring to a point. All are of algarroba wood. The flat pieces, though fragmented, may have been used for weaving. The cylindrical pieces may have been loom bars, the handles for drills or parts of staffs (av. diameter 1 cm.). The pointed pieces might have been drills or used in weaving. In the miscellaneous ca tegory is a long (c. 1.75 m.) staff with metallic rivets or incrustations ; a tablet of light wood ; a small stick with cotton point (perhaps for delicate painting), and a number of fragments of algarroba wood without definable form. The possibility of establishing a clearer relationship between the frag mentary tools and the processes of manufacture of the shell artifacts or perhaps some other activity in the huaca depends upon a re-examination of the material which is not available at this time. In summary, we may reaffirm the validity of including the wood sculpture in the original huaca complex, related as it is to the shell inlay, and with its high concentration in context 2. The fact that fragments of idols were found in all but one of the cells cleared indicates that their original location was probably in the cells. Complete lack of any wood sculpture in the other areas is confirming evidence. The original status of the other wood artifacts is more doubtful. The cylin drical and rectangular pieces may be identified as two types of tools used originally in the huaca, and, by association with an analogous inlaid piece said by Neira to have been found by him in the huaca, the light wood tablet</page><page sequence="72">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 439 may be included. The staff and other fragments, however, may pertain to any period of occupation. Textiles. Most of the pieces had to be considered simply « fragments », though in many cases the pieces seemed to represent squares or rectangles of cloth, probably used for wrapping. Plain cloth was found in all points of the huaca except the ramp, 10 and 11. Although some of the gauze-type textile was interred with the child burial at point 9G, the general distribution of this type is so diffuse that it cannot provide us much of a guide as to the use of this type of cloth. The pieces having form were found for the most part in one of the cells : rectangular pendants, discs, tassles, bands and the square cloth. The bundle is in context 1. A shirt with remains of a few metal discs was found at point 1 near the line of evacuation, as was the sling and the feather headdress. The paint rag, with remains of yellow paint, was found in point 12, and by association with the friezes may be considered part of the original huaca complex. Because of the very abundance and poor state of conservation of the tex tiles, we were able to make only a preliminary field classification of the tex tiles at the huaca. As far as our incomplete analysis went, cotton was the principal fiber used, with wool used for warp occasionally and in tapestry. Textile fragments were typed according to two categories : ornamental and nonornamental. Three prevailing types of undecorated cloth were found : a white, coarse cloth with thick thread and close weave ; brown with me dium thick thread and medium weave ; and white with loose weave and medium-fine thread (similar to gauze). Decorated cloth included : brown weft over brown and white warf ; brown weft over white warf ; white over white and brown ; white over white and black. Designs were sewn around the edge usually in several colors, principally yellow and red. One fragment of double cloth with polychrome border, several fragments with kelim tech nique and a fragment of stamped design were also included in the decorated textiles. It should be noted, however, that in the adjoining huaca Tacaynamo a number of fine pieces of small stamped textiles have been found, with designs like the friezes on the huaca, and in all likelihood, the technique was particularly popular during this epoch. Other recent finds of large pieces of painted cloth from the north coast that have appeared in museums of Europe and the United States appear to show stylistic similarities in treat ment and motives to the huaca Dragón friezes. Such large, highly decorated pieces could have been used as a « curtain » or tapestry on the blank west wall panel 14. No listing of the textile fragments is given at this time, since the mate rial has not been analyzed. It is hoped that at a future time a scientific des cription and analysis of the textiles can be presented, hopefully in combi nation with the richer Tacaynamo material.</page><page sequence="73">440 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES Clothing in the Huaca. Accessory evidence from the friezes and the wood sculpture indicates that the figures portrayed in the ceremonies were nude to the waist, and that the males wore a triangular breechclout or a short skirt. The inlay on the trunk and lower extremities of the idols seems to indicate either body paint ing or tattoing, since no attempt is made to define the borders of possible shirts or skirts. Against this interpretation is the shirt with the metal discs, found at point 1, which could be the type of garment meant to be repre sented in the standing figures. The only other body clothing on the idols is feathering (whatever this may mean). The figures on the friezes are uni versally clad in a breechclout with trailing flap and presumably tassles at the end. Headdress types are rather sharply delimited. Those on the idols are either trapezoidal or skull-caps. It would appear, aesthetically repugnant as it may be, that all females were represented with skull caps. Some of the seated figures, whose sex is not determinable, wear the skull caps too, but all the figures definitely engaged in male activities wear the trapezoidal headdress. Seen in side view, as on the small humunculi figures, this looks like a peaked troglodyte headpiece, but it apparently represents the same form. The head piece found at point 1 may correspond to the trapezoidal form, since some of the headdresses found on the idols have vertical strips of inlay that seem to portray feathers. There may, however, have been some more durable frame over which this headband was set. Thus some tentative connections may be established between the gar ments worn by the figures on the frieze, the idols and the textiles found in the huaca. One fragment of stamped textile was found complete in the adjoining huaca Tacaynamo, which had an apron form and a diminutive size. If our fragments of bands and small ornamental cloth had the same reconstructable form, it might be possible that some of the fine textiles were used to clothe the idols, especially the nude ones. Except for the shirt, head dress and larger fragments of cloth, there is no textile in the huaca which clearly indicates what the occupants may have worn. Even these may be attributed to burials with equal reason. Thus the interpretation of the tex tiles, unlike that of the ceramics and shell artifacts, leads to an enigma which we cannot resolve. Assuming that a certain number of textiles pertain to the original huaca complex by 1) context 2 association ; 2) similarity to the frieze figures' clothing ; or 3) similarity to the idols' clothing, we cannot separate them on the basis of use for the living (workers) of the huaca or for the dead (burials). Metallic Artifacts. Only preliminary classification was made of the metal pieces found in the huaca, so that we do not know if all the pieces had the same components.</page><page sequence="74">METAL Al Cell Cell 5 Fig. 11 CELL 1 : a, b, i, j : silver fish ornaments ; d \ bird ornament ; e : bell ; /, g, h : discs.

The artifacts may be grouped into two large categories : ornaments and « rivets ». The ornaments include a series of biomorphic plates of thin metal, most of them perforated for attachment, and a series of geometric shapes (fig. 11). In addition, there are 29 bells, which were probably used for the slight auditory effect they may have given when moved, one tiny spoon, and several tubular plates either for sheeting a staff or for wrist or arm bands. Indirect evidence of other metallic forms may be deduced from the idols, the bases of whose skullcaps are lined with « nail » holes at regular inter vals. This would indicate some metallic headpiece was originally fastened on. One obol, or folded fragment of copper, recognizable from other archaeo logical contexts as an offering placed in the mouth of the cadaver, completes the list. The « rivets » were found on the body of the feather-incrusted idol, and were apparently bits of melted copper used to « glue » on the feathers to the wood. Similar rivets were found on the large staff, but no attached ele ments remained. We hazard the guess that the stave-bearing figures of the framing motive on the friezes may be holding this type of sceptre, which on the friezes shows a leaf of plume-like appendages at the wide end. The « rivets » on the staff we found may have been for securing such adornments.

Nectandra (Chart 7). Immense quantités of perforated nectandra seeds were found in the huaca. We have recorded the ones found in any reasonable context, but the sur face in many places yielded additional quantities whose enumeration we could not control. As noted previously, the context 1 association establishes beyond cavil the fact that perforated nectandra seeds were accumulated</page><page sequence="77">442 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES and strung into beads in the huaca. The burial in 9G indicates that the col lars or necklaces were interred with the dead. Their presence in the wrap ped offering under the wall in 9G bespeaks some supernatural importance for the nectandra. All the contexts of 1 indicate that the nectandra form ed an important component of the original complex. The possible value attached to these seeds is, of course, unknown, but Raimondi (1 : 339) noted that in his day they were much prized as a remedy for intermittent fevers, were consumed by Steatornis birds, and were aro matic. Of these qualities perhaps the aromatic aspect was the one most prized in the huaca complex. The distribution of the seeds in the huaca is not particularly useful in determining whether they were made into beads in all cells or not. It does conform to the distribution of cadavers in the upper platform. Miscellaneous Artifacts. 1. A curious adobe, measuring 10 X 15 x 18 centimeters with nine pair ed holes on one (fig. 3) face was found in cell 4. At the time of the find we could think of no possible use, especially since no other such adobe was re covered. We now submit that it may have been one of the wall adobes used for keeping tools, since the holes are more or less the diameter of the cylin drical type of algarroba tool. A « sandwich » of white powder (calcium) packed between two balls of adobe was found at the base of the wall at 9G. This seems to represent the form of depositing the paint powder to be mixed with liquid and applied at the time needed. Human Remains. The quantity of bones found in the huaca presents one of the greatest problems in interpretation of the contents. It will be seen that bones were found in every point except the ramp proper. One child burial was found almost intact within the platform of the huaca (point 9G). All the rest had been badly disturbed. For example, in cells 10 and 11 which were in con text 2 and therefore less disturbed than the others, 4 mandibles were found in one cell and four occipitals in the other. The intervening bones were partially in fragments and partially mangled beyond recognition. Con tinuing with the skeletal evidence in these cells, we have evidence for eight cadavers on the basis of complete skulls and fragments thereof, but the rest of the skeletal material is at most sufficient for 3 and a fraction. The best correlation of bones was recovered on the entrance platform, where an ob viously late search for well-endowed cadavers proved unrewarding, and the bones were left near their point of interment. We made only a preliminary classification of the bones, so that the pos sibility that they were originally in fragmented condition was not checked. Before facing up to an explanation of this osseous nightmare, we should</page><page sequence="78">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 443 note that the distribution chart shows the region where few ceremonial arti facts were found to be the densest in bones (points 7, 8, 9, 12-14) with one important exception of point 5. We have offered an explanation of this unique point which may be a tour de force, but at least satisfies the rest of the evi dence (Chart 8). By an equally broad guess on the line of evacuation to the south that would put point 8 bones with those from point 7 and the south end of the main platform, we may account for approximately 3 /4 of the bones as com ing originally from the main platform. Even so, 340 bones and 7 more or less complete skulls were found with cell provenience. It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that some individuals either died or were buried in the cells. If so, we are confronted by the problem of con juring up the macabre aspect of cell 11. There the deposits of shell and nec tandra were neatly placed on the floor ready to be worked, all the evidence indicating that they were so worked and hence a worker engaged in this activity ; and a cadaver or two somewhere in the corner. This would have to have been the case were the interments contemporaneous with the original use of the huaca. In the event that they occurred afterwards, then there is no problem except for the paucity of the usual type of grave offering. We thus propose that the bones in the cells correspond to either post occupa tional intrusive burial or to the corpses of the last shift of shell cutters. Bones from the center may correspond to a late phase of the occupation of the huaca (since this is shown by Uhle to have been a Tiahuanacoid prac tice), and some may even be later, since the fragments of decorated Chimu blackware indicate some burial offerings in the central portion. A detailed analysis of the bones found in the huaca will shed considerable light on the probable use of the structure for mortuary ends. Our superficial observations only showed that the majority of individuals were adolescents, that most teeth showed considerable caries and wearing down from maize chewing, and that seven of the fifteen skulls measured showed the typical Chimu type « tabular-erect » deformation. We are, until this material is carefully analyzed, predisposed to attribute the great majority of the bur ials to the Chimu occupation and to discount the possibility that the huaca had a basically funerary function at its inception. Flora and Fauna : The four animal bones were not classified by a com petent authority, but probably belong to the Auchenidae. Two mandibles and two fragments of a mandible were found as well as seven other animal bones all in context 3. The bird feathers and leg were identified as pertain ing to the parrot family (Psittaciformes) by Sr. Juan Ormea, director of the Zoological Museum of the University of Trujillo. It is rather likely that these formed part of the huaca complex, although except for the two « feathered » idols, we can adduce no proof. Two gourd fragments (Lagenaria) were found, both in context 3, and a number of maize husks which may not be very ancient. Some unspun cot ton was recovered near the exterior walls. The fibrë used in most of the ropes</page><page sequence="79">444 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES was enea. As noted before algarroba, caña de Guayaquil, caña brava and a light, balsa-like wood were used for the wooden artifacts and roof sup ports (Chart 7). We were unsuccessful in having the wood analyzed, although it is unlikely it represents wood from a very distant region (PI. 27 b). Summary of Contents and their Distributional Context (Chart 3). In our analysis of the classes of contexts, the unique group of artifacts that characterized the linked contexts 1 and 2 probably constituted the base of a ceremonial complex particular to the huaca El Dragón. As we have proceeded to review the total contents in their relative contexts, it has been possible to reaffirm this interpretation for the wooden idols, the shell arti facts, the nectandra and the metallic artifacts. We have established a cera mic complex which may be added. We were unable to satisfactorily isolate a textile complex or to assess with certainty the relationship to the complex of the human remains. The huaca complex then consists definitely of the following : 1) Wooden idols with shell and algarroba inlay and feather incrustations of the types defined. 2) Spondylus and strombus shells for manufacture probably of collars and necklaces. 3) Nectandra seeds and beads for necklaces. 4) Smoothed reduced and oxidized fired ceramics of the shapes defined. 5) Paint implements and containers. 6) Textiles with sewed-on metallic attachments. A secondary funerary complex may be established on the basis of the platform burial and the possible funerary aspects of some of the textile, metal and bone contents of context 2 (rooms 10 and 11). Only the platform burial can be accepted as valid, since the other data is inferential and might equally well be attributed to ceremonial storage plus disturbed bones from the platform. The secondary complex, however, indicates a period slightly later, at least than the original construction. If only by inference, we may be fairly sure that the platform was built before the child was interred, that the shells were accumulated in the huaca as well as the nectandra. In other words, the burial would appear to date from some period when the huaca was in full use, and thus represents a sub-period. It may well be taken as indicative of the manner of disposing of the dead who were associated with the temple, but we have no other evidence to confirm this. The non-huaca complex is composed of the residue. It is isolated on the basis of its distribution only in context 3. Its ceramic components are : Coastal Inca, decorated polished black, grit tempered black, white/red, Chancay and sandy plain ware. This complex</page><page sequence="80">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 445 may all be contemporaneous and represent one re-occupation, or it may represent a Chimu and a later Inca phase. Some nonceramic components cannot be established on distributional iso lation but rather on distributional density. On this basis we should include then : lama bones and a certain class of textiles and possibly the mass bu rials mostly without iunerary offering. The basis for subdividing this non-huaca complex rests on the interpre tation of the structural and content elements, and for the moment can be considered one complex. There is fairly good inferential evidence to enable us to separate the supposed mass burials of the non-huaca complex from the secondary huaca complex platform burial. This rests on the fact that almost 40-50 cadavers were interred in the huaca. If the pattern of the child burial were followed, a much greater quantity of intact skulls would have been recovered. It is equally demonstrable that the space occupied by the child burial if used for the others would have made the core of the huaca structurally unservicable, or hollow. The very battered, badly fragmented condition of the bones also probably reflects not only secondary pillaging but a hasty and careless primary interment. We shall now examine the contents together with the structural features, keeping in mind the necessity of isolating the non-huaca complex from those structural and decorative features which constituted the original structure. VI. INTERRELATION OF THE ARCHITECTURE AND CONTENTS The Structural Features and the Contents. It has been necessary to treat these two aspects independently up to now in order to show the degree to which they may be interrelated. In order to completely explain the function of either they must be analyzed together. We have seen, from our structural analysis, that the huaca is ornately decorated with friezes both inside and out. This might indicate either a temple or cult site or the house or palace of a distinguished personage. The contents reveal no evidence of the use of the huaca for ordinary living purposes, but do support the first hypothesis that it was a place where ceremonial activ ities were carried on. In terms of mural decoration then, the friezes are as unique an element in comparison with other archaeological sites on the coast as is the huaca complex which is constituted by the contents. Before referring to the form of the structure itself in the same light, we shall review its component elements as related to the artifacts and other associated ma terial. As we noted in describing the structure, there are two main divisions of the structure : the perimeter wall and the main structure with its subdivi sions. The contents found by the perimeter wall that may be directly related to its use were fragments of containers with paint to be applied to the friezes,</page><page sequence="81">446 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES in context 1. We are thus assured that the exterior was maintained with some degree of care so that the original colors were always preserved while the temple was in use. Since this behavior of « retouching » the wall was going on until the temple was disoccupied, it resolves one problem of inter preting the purpose of painted wall decorations when the paint had no fixer. The caretakers constantly repainted. The other evidence from the undis turbed exterior was negative. No material was found to indicate any other activity. The disturbed material found in the exterior relates to the pilla ging from the inside. Of the main structure, we may rapidly dispense with the ramp, which was found in much the same condition as the exterior walls, though mostly in context 2. Fortunately, it had not been used as a place for evacuating debris, so that the absence of artifacts along its surface, probably reflects the state in which it was abandoned. The six sherds found in the clearing of the ramp shed little light on the rather obvious use it had. They appear to have been pieces of discarded ceramics which had probably been carried along it at one time. The other divisions of the main structure must be discussed in a different way than when we were treating of the edifice because of the disturbed con texts. Thus, the area that constituted the causeway and main platform will be treated in terms of the total pillaging operation so that they necessarily include the material found at point 5, points 4, 7 and 8 and exteriors 1 and 3. Only the entrance platform may be treated somewhat separately insofar as it represents the highest extant level of the huaca and hence an area from which material was removed but to which little material was probably con veyed. The cells, as we have seen throughout the discussion of the con tents, form a unit of varying contextual validity, but essentially represent a homogeneous section of the structure which corresponds to their struc tural uniformity. Beginning with the entrance platform, the structure itself and the friezes indicate that this was a processionally important section if not the most important of the huaca. The contents indicate that it was being repainted along with the exterior at the time of abandonment. In the floor, some few courses of adobes down, was found the child burial, the nectandra offering wrapped in textile and remains of some 8 individuals which were also prob ably buried intrusively in the platform. We have just stated that the child burial may be included in the secondary huaca complex. There seems no reason to exclude the remains of the other cadavers from this same complex and they may well pertain to it ; but since there is no clear dividing line between point 9, the entrance platform and points 12, 13 and 14 of the cau seway, we have preferred to consider the context 3 material of point 9 with that of the causeway. We must then, regard the remainder of the contents of 9 as probably part of the funerary complex, although recognizing that here there is overlap. The causeway, as we have noted in the architectural part, continued for</page><page sequence="82">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 447 at least several meters. The contents from this zone (12, 13 and 14) pertain for the most part to the complex of burials, although, like in point 9, ele ments of the maintenance complex are present. Unfortunately then, the contents fail to supplement the almost non-existent structural evidence to indicate what the use of this section of the huaca may have been. Let us suppose that we interpret the cadavers as originally having been in this area, and that for this reason the « causeway » and hence in all probability the huge and honey-combed upper platform were origi nally intented as a sort of multiple grave chamber. There are no intrusive artifacts which can be definitely associated with later periods, so that this is a tenable hypothesis on the grounds of content. Structurally it is equally tenable, since no transverse wall sections or supports for the missing plat form floor were noted in our clearing of the interior core. If this were the case, the lack of communication with the interior of the upper platform would be self-explanatory, although some passageway from the south group of cells to the entrance platform would still have to be hypothecated. With a hollow core, the doorways could have lead down via ramps and then up. The Negative Evidence of the Contents. Few frieze fragments beyond the immediate area of the entrance platform lend support to the interpretation of a hollow center for the upper platform. We did not excavate this section, so that it is possible that a more adequate explanation will be found ; but with equally valid evidence for two radically different interpretations, i.e. a hollow center or a mass platform with intrusive burials, we must incline to the solution which requires fewest suppositions. The form that the hol low center took can only be hypothecated. It is also largely hypothetical whether the burials were under it or over it, since the contents are not defi nitely intrusive, and the only conclusion we may draw from them is that the maintenance and funerary complexes are present and that the cell com plex is not. If the burials were contemporaneous with the huaca, then some sort of « floor filling » operation must have been carried on, which successively raised the level of the central depression. If not, the central area may well have had the form of a sunken plaza. In discussing the two routes of evacuation : south route via room 7 and corridor 8 to points 1 and 3, and the north route at point 5, we are confronted by two different contexts. The north route, as we mentioned previously, shows an accumulation of stripped cadavers which may well correspond to the funerary complex. The south route reveals a more diffuse distribution of cadavers with some accoutrements in addition to elements of the cell (work-shop) complex and some elements of the maintenance complex. It is further complicated by the presence of intrusive ceramics. Of the funerary complex and maintenance complex which can be esta blished for points 9, 12 and 13 and 14, we shall « peal off » the former : cada vers, nectandra beads, decorated textiles, wrappings, shells, and decorated pottery. We may also subtract the maintenance section : utilitarian pot</page><page sequence="83">448 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES tery, paint receptacles. This leaves us with elements of the workshop and ceremonial complex : wooden idols, shell fragments, inlay and the intrusive pottery. When we consider that room 7 appears to have been radically alter ed from its original form, it is possible to associate this with the intrusive pottery, and to associate the workshop complex to its original use. The funer ary and maintenance components then would apply to the main platform. The workshop elements indicate a former use of the area 7 as a cell. The structural evidence for this being the case has been reviewed, and the evi dence from the interrupted frieze is the strongest argument for the altera tion having taken place after the huaca had lost its original integrity. The combination of Inca coastal pottery Chancay fragments and the grit-tempered black though not in any clearly defined context supports the structural and mural evidence that the alteration was later, in fact during the Inca period. There is nothing to indicate what the Incaic occupation was meant to be. The outlying position of the huaca, however, is sufficient to have made it strategic for the Incas either during the campaign against Chan Chan or afterwards as a point of observation. The small amount of Incaic material rather supports the first possibility. Iconographie Evidence : Possible Interpretations. In seeking for an interpretation of the iconography of the huaca, it is rea sonable to assume that the contents and reconstructable function either delimit or bear some close relation to the motives of the friezes. Possibly a minute analysis and careful exploration of all potentially reason able hypotheses will at some future time establish such a relationship. We can only indicate some of the possible lines that should be followed, since we are unable to arrive at any interpretation that satisfies the complex icono graphie situation. Even a « phonemic » instead of « semantic » analysis, which we have attempted without much success, will probably be difficult because of the gaps in the panel sequence. With these observations then, we shall proceed to indicate as much as we can reasonably reconstruct from the panorama of motives. Identification of the biomorphic forms offers the most likely path to a successful interpretation. In this respect, we submit that two possibilities are likely : that the vertical panels are either flying or swimming. The pro bability that they are flying is supported by the presence of the « claws » and volute appendages which are unlikely for marine fauna. If the domi nant motives be construed as air figures, it is reasonable to suppose that they are insects, presumably stinging types. Whether the main motive 1 on the horizontal panel is what Horkheimer considered to be a centipede is difficult to say. The double and single-headed « serpent » figures are equally problematical as to identification. Their representation suggests strongly that they are used as symbols. The anthropomorphic figures, IV and Y, are the only ones that give us a clue as to the sort of human activity that is meant to be represented. These</page><page sequence="84">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 449 figures are shown either carrying, pulling or placing one of a class of un identifiable objects. From the various forms which this object takes it is difficult to imagine what is meant to be represented. It is usually shown with a square or rectangular base and a series, single or double, of super-imposed trapezoids (cut in half, when double). These could represent a plant-stalk leaves complex or some material or bundles placed in a carrying device. There are two or three sections which seem to indicate that the material is being extracted from other biomorphic figures, but if so, it is difficult to imagine just what material it might be. No such object was found in the huaca. Possibilities are : tentacles, feathers, bricks, branches, containers of some sort (perhaps for honey ?). Whatever the figures are securing or car rying, the general impression given by the double-headed motive 1, is that they are engaged in perilous activity. Motive I and III seem to maintain little change once they appear. Perhaps III may have some sort of « place » status, since it is basic upon a square, but again we can find no correlation between this and the changes in the other motives (e.g., entering or leaving the &lt;c place »). A possible meaning for motive II is that of sexual reproduction. It seems to have had to get intertwined and be constantly « kissing » before the third motive or the human figures could appear on the west wall, although the two serpents are shown once (west panel 16) eating or disgorging a head. There seems to be no change in the two figures (motive II) further along or as motive VIII appears on the south wall. The movements of the anthropomorphs vary considerably, especially the feet, the form of the face, the headgear and the object carried. No apparent sequence of activity, however, can be extrapolated, except that their acti vities appear to be more carefully delineated and perhaps more incipient in the west wall and become more completed and fuller on the south wall. The figures that form the framing motive are the simplest to interpret. They all wear what is apparently a trailing breechclout and a trailing head dress. The headdress may well be composed of the substance the small an thropomorphs are « collecting ». They hold well-defined tapering staves with « plumes » or « leaves » attached to the upper section. The figures that form the gateway motive seem to represent some anthro pomorph (probably the framing motive figure) caught in the grasp of some serpentiform creature. If any key is to be worked out, the interpretation of the upper and lower panels should be resolved. Except for the inverse correlation on relative size noted for the north wall, no significant differences were noted between upper and lower panels. The paucity of panels for comparison is one of the main drawbacks. The second probable interpretation is that of marine activity. Some basis for this, aside from the identifications that might be made of the « swim ming figures » and the possible octopus-like main figure, lies in the repre</page><page sequence="85">450 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES sentation of the object carried, which could be interpreted as a single — and double — barbed harpoon shaft. In order to relate the interpretation of the frieze iconography to the in terior, a study of the forms of behavior related to the acquisition of the two types of shells, the wood and nectandra will be necessary. At this writing, only indirect connections between the contents and the frieze motives may be observed. Most of these have already been remarked upon in the section on textile contents. These are the probable similarity in the trapezoidal headdress (idols and anthropomorphic motives IV and V) ; the staff found with rivets (with the staff borne by the framing motive figure) ; the tassel ending of the breechclout on the framing figure (with the tassels found in the huaca) ; the feather-headdress (with the type headdress of the framing figures) ; the similarity between certain fish motives on the textiles and what some of the anthropomorphs may be carrying. Tantalizing as the problem is, we are obliged to leave the interrelationship between the contents and the frieze motives in an undefined state. It is fairly certain from the very nature of the frieze iconography that it pertains to some cult activity with procession as a notable feature. The key points are marked by the processional figures with staves, the gateways by prostrate figures, the blank wall, centered below the important west wall of the en trance platform, which in turn produced the unique huge human head ; all these features of the frieze and structure interrelate to indicate the cere monial character of the friezes. The jump to the ceremonial complex on the basis of motive analogy, however, is admittedly weak. Equally weak, at least on the basis of the limited investigation so far carried out, is the relationship between the inferred activity (workshop) complex and the frieze iconography. The most likely probability is that the frieze represents some activity prior to the cult activities around which most of the contents cluster. The Function of the Temple. We have described and analyzed several different types of evidence that we found in clearing this structure-architectural, mural, contextual, arti factual, and biological. We have attempted, where possible, to interrelate them. In so doing we have anticipated a few conclusions as to function with which we are now concerned. There is little reason to doubt that the huaca was a temple, i.e., a structure dedicated to cult activities. All the types of evidence point to this. We are reasonably sure that it was used intermitt ently by a small core of artisans, probably directed by some priest, to pre pare for periodic ceremonies. This we deduce from the limited number of rooms and the extant evidence of the workshop and maintenance complexes. The ceremonies which were performed here we can only surmise. The most certain activities that took place were processions, display (possibly in pro cession) of sets of wooden idols, and some interment procedure. The sym bolism associated with the ceremonies, to judge from the friezes, was highly</page><page sequence="86">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 451 complex and appears to be related to a group of air or sea-dwelling « divi nities ». The general aspect of the iconography suggests human activity under perilous conditions, if not imminent death. From a preliminary ana lysis of the human remains and textiles, it would appear that interment took place in the core of the huaca. Since only one entrance, via the ramp, is possible, the bodies of victims were brought up this processional route and dumped. The fact that they are mostly of one age group indicates selec tion. This may be pre-hoc, in other words, the cadavers were buried because the persons had died of a certain cause, or they were selected to die because of certain conditions (age, economic, social status, etc.). There were no in dications that the persons interred belonged to a particular occupation. The one intact burial indicates a child either related to the rites carried on in the temple or a dedicatory burial in the platform with the offerings pecu liar to the cult of the huaca. There is reason to presume that this was not the typical mode of interment of most of the other cadavers. In discussing the means of access to the temple cells we have indicated that efforts were made to keep passageways between more than two sets of cells closed. It should also be obvious by now that entrance and parti cularly exit from the cells was impossible without the aid of ladders or an ad hoc staircase of loose adobes. Still another feature of the huaca which reinforces the hypothesis that the rooms were indeed convent-like cells, is the absence of hearths which indicates that the food the artisans consumed was probably carried to them. Some aspects of the cult are deducible from the poses of the idols. These are, that certain figures were servants or attendants presumably to more important ones (see Schaedel : 1951C). We found only « serving » figures ; litter-bearers, cup-bearers, female attendants. Most of them in seated posi tion were hunchbacked, a feature known from North America to the region of Cuzco in pre-historic times to be associated with class-stratified ceremo nial. The figures on the frieze are also of two basic types : staff-bearers, who appear to be free of imminent peril and proceed with at least the posture of a soldier, and anthropomorphs, often with rather grotesque facial cari cature, always beset by an open-mouthed monster, and carrying objects in both hands. The latter give the definite impression of laborers of a more menial category than the staff-bearers. Only fragments were found of two figures that may have had more importance than the staff-bearers : 1) a huge face done front view, and 2) a hand with five fingers grasping a knife. The staff-bearers are distinguished from the anthropomorphs by headgear and breechclout as well as by less baggage. Combining the two sets of deductions, we are in a position to confirm the implications of the complex iconography and affirm that the cult here practiced was a manifestation of a socially stratified society wherein there are at least two and possibly three ranks which are represented in the temple ceremonies : a directing group, a pro cessional or artisan group, and a laboring group. From the isolated character of the temple, it is unlikely that a habita</page><page sequence="87">452 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES tion would be found too close. The peripheral wall, the small gateways, the complex network of intercommunication between terrace segments, the dif ficulty of access and exit from the cells all bespeak a deliberate intent on the part of the builders and maintainers to create an exclusive cult center. Its solitary location apparently prevented its intensive reuse in later periods. The total social context in which this cult functioned is not known. We shall examine shortly what we do know about its regional and temporal extensions. Suffice it to say here that it was not the only temple of its kind. We were unable to find any immediate broader context in which to place the temple. This implies no real mystery, since there is every reason to be lieve that it slightly antedates Chan Chan and that the habitation site to which it corresponds underlies Chan Chan. VII. SOCIO-HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HUACA DRAGON Affiliations in Time and Space : the Moche Valley. The only site in the Moche Valley for the brief Tiahuanacoid I phase was the huaca del Sol. For Tiahuanacoid II, the upvalley town of Galindo was the capital and continued to be occupied through Chimu times, but it is likely that with the evidence from the huaca Dragon, we may well have the first indications of a new coastward shift to the sloping sandy pampa on which Chan Chan is built (Schaedel : 1966 : 339-340). The huaca Dragón is the only pre-Chimu structure which is walled and has the stucco-type low relief friezes. The Mochica mural decoration was painted. The major Mochica structures were either free-standing or com posed of a large pyramid with adjoining walled corridors. If we contrast the Dragón with previously undescribed Tiahuanacoid II edifices in the valley (Kosok : 1965 : 93 : fig. 14-16) we find that they are basically com posed of staggered terraces with a symmetrical plan and a central ramp. The construction is almost always stone and puddled adobe or rubble. The huaca architecturally, then, partakes of a coastal tradition in masonry that represents a break with the Tiahuanacoid period architecture. Structurally, or formally, it can be compared with certain structures in Chan Chan, espe cially Esmeralda (Horkheimer : fig. 63), and Calvario de los Incas and the frieze-decorated buildings in the Uhle group (Kosok : 1965 : 85 : fig. 19). Also the perimeter wall, a feature of the huaca, is typical only of Chan Chan in the valley. It shares many traits in common with its sister huaca, Tacay namo, which we only superficially cleared. Examples of painted low relief from Tacaynamo were all fallen. Stylistic ally they are similar but employ more reds and greens and a different motive repertoire (PI. 28 b). Some fragments of the same technique were discovered under the walls of the main building of the Uhle group in Chan Chan. This scanty but significant evidence lends support to what we have proposed</page><page sequence="88">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 453 previously : that the huaca is representative of a new type of mural deco ration and architecture which probably contributed many of the architec tural elements of Chan Chan. The Chan Chan friezes are similar, but the technique is that of cutting away the design from the plaster rather than moulding the figures and « pas ting » them to the moist wall. In addition, there are no extant examples of polychrome reliefs in Chan Chan, though many were painted white and others have been reported to be yellow. A few illustrations (Kosok : 1965 : 74 : top : 83 ; fig. 13) are sufficient to show the stylistic difference between the Chan Chan reliefs and these of the Dragon. The closest analogies are with the friezes in the Velarde group and here the stylistic difference is not unlike that of the Rococo succeeding the Baroque (PI. 29). Other examples of the Chan Chan wall decorative style or styles are basically plectomorphic or at least much more repetitive and geometricized than those of even the Velarde group. No noticeable narrative quality or complex symbolism which so pervades the Dragon reliefs can be detected. The huaca Dragón then represents a new, and as yet undefined, archi tectural stage in the Tiahuanacoid sequence which Bennett first defined on the basis of burial pottery. The architecture and type of frieze decoration is shown to be markedly distinct from Tiahuanacoid building types and intermediate between the Mochica and Chimu forms. It relates closest to the latter. The contents of the huaca show a similar placement to be reasonable. We have discussed the ceramic association as closest to Uhle's lot 2 material from the huaca del Sol. The one example of an intact burial of the huaca corresponds to the plat form burial in the huaca del Sol described by Uhle for the Tiahuanacoid III period. The form of the other, presumably mass burials, recalls Squier's remarks in two places (Squier : 119, 123) associated with his reconnaissance of Tacaynamo and the Castillo or Calvario de los Incas. Subsequently, Hrdlicka made a similar observation on the latter site. Both these writers made no distinction between any phase of Chimu culture and naturally associated both edifices with the time of the city of Chan Chan. While it is reasonable to suppose that one of the features of urban Chan Chan was the designation of outlying isolated compounds for certain types of burials (perhaps from motives of contagion) it is unproved that the Calvario cor responds to the age of the city ; and it is also to be demonstrated whether the practice existed as it may have in Dragón, of a reuse of older buildings. To resolve this important question, excavations at the Calvario, Tacaynamo and smaller buildings near Dragón will be necessary. It may be added here that our brief clearing of parts of Tacaynamo tended to substantiate the interpretation that the burials were intrusive, since in the clearing the cor ridor walls few skeletons, but many elements of ceremony such as staffs and costumes were found. The structures described for the Viru valley or those further south do il</page><page sequence="89">454 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES not indicate close resemblances to the Dragón. The connections for the To maval period V-171 and similar « great rectangular enclosures » defined by Willey have little in common either in masonry or form with the huaca. (Collier : 1955 : 93-98 ; Willey : 1953 : 237-238.) The northbound strain of black-white-red ceramics was also absent in the Dragón pottery. This negative evidence combined with positive evi dence from analogous mural, architectural and ceramic material from the north indicate that this phase of the Moche represents the ebbing of the northbound Tiahuanacoid wave and a strong southbound « Lambayequoid » counter-current. With regard to non-ceramic artifacts, no other sites either in the Moche or the adjacent valleys produced the same complex of nectandra, shells, wooden idols and sewn metal adornments, although they have been found individually as offering in one or another burial from Mochica through Chimu periods. (Larco : 1939-40 ; Bennett : 1939 ; Kroeber : 1944 ; Strong : 1948 ; Collier : 1953.) The Guario Islands. The closest affinities of the non-ceramic complex of the huaca is with the Guano Island complex described in Kubler's presentation of Guano chro nology. (Kubler : 1948.) Kubler (1948 : 40) stated « The artifacts (of the Guano Island material) suggest a special Guano Island apparatus and iconography », although he elaborated only to the point of identifying the complex as Mochica and rela ting it to the search for guano as fertilizer and a ritualistic cult in which prisoners were punished and sacrificed. The similarities between the complex at the huaca Dragón and the guano complex are striking, and indicate that the complex was not confined to the Mochica period. Among the correspon dences are wooden idols (closest resemblances are to the female type), nec tandra necklaces (although these are called « cacao seeds » in one place and « oval brown berries » in another), spondylus shells, wooden staffs and the silver fishes. The textiles are not described specifically enough to make iden tification positive, but the general description in color and weave corresponds to the undecorated « wrappings » found in the huaca. If we choose a sea motive interpretation of the frieze, the hypothesis can be presented that the temple may have been the mainland cult center having to do with the ceremonies and commerce of the islands . There are many questions to be resolved in countering Kubler's arguments for a 14th century date for the Chincha Island complex (which includes the best dated helmeted female idol). The assignment of the Macabí finds (which include nectandra, textiles, wood sculpture and shells) is uncertain because of the varying depths of guano given. It seems prudent to suggest that Ku bler's earlier date of 1535 for the Bollaert slab be accepted, placing the Chincha Island helmeted figure and silver fishes in the 13th century. The dating of the huaca Dragón is 11th century at the earliest and 12th at the latest, so</page><page sequence="90">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 455 that the time correspondence between the two sites would be close enough to account for resemblances. Most of the Guañape and Macabí finds are at relatively slight depths and point to a later continuation in time of the Mochica guano complex. It seems likely that the Tiahuanacoid phase of the complex can be separated from the Mochica by using the representation of female figures and headless mummies as against the nude male prisoners which (when clearly documented) are found in lower depths and with clearcut Mochica pottery association. The significance of the Guano Island apparatus that Kubler has identi fied, as expanded from the association with the huaca Dragón material, must be more far-reaching in both time and space than Kubler originally surmised. By relating the procurement of wood and shells from a possibly far northwest Pacific source to regular fishing and guano procurement, we may suppose the Islands served as way stations for a coastwise commerce that possibly connected Ecuador to mainland Peruvian cultures. While it appears likely that the Mochica culture was the first to utilize the Islands systematically, the later material and house construction point to an esta blished traffic along the entire coast. At this point the only clear importa tion appears to be the spondylus. Should the light wood, used for sculpturing some of the idols, be determined to be balsa wood, known only from Ecuador north, we would have a more firm connection. The relationship of the huaca to the Lambayeque sites should now be examined, as here from yet another source, there are hypothetical connections between the huaca, the Guano Islands and Ecuador. Lambayeque Associations with the Huaca Complex. In opening this discussion, we shall try to keep the various kinds of evi dence as separate as possible, since the degree of reliability varies tremen dously. On the other hand, the general trend of all the evidence is uniform, pointing to a southbound « current » at least and a northern source at most for the phase of occupation in the Moche valley which we have designated Tiahuanacoid III /Moche and which corresponds to the main use of the huaca. Although we have already discussed much of the artifactual evidence, it may be well to sum up here that a strong current of blackware gradually penetrated the Moche valley (and the adjoining Chicama and Viru valleys) during Tiahuanacoid times, so that by the end of the period the percentages of blackware to oxidized fireware is almost the reverse to that which it was at the end of Mochica times. Collier : 1953 : 121 ; Kroeber : 1925b : 253 ; Collier : 1955 : 120 ; Strong : 245, have attributed this to a southbound wave of influence with a presumed source in the Lambayeque valley complex (Lambayeque, Leche and Motupe valleys). It can be dated as beginning around Tiahuanacoid II (Middle Tomaval) and continuing in increasing strength to the Chimu period. One of the hallmarks of the « pottery inva sion » is the first appearance of paddle-ware which seems to be clearly of far north origin. As we have indicated the huaca Dragón ceramics corres</page><page sequence="91">456 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES pond to this phase both in terms of percentage of blackware and for the presence of paddle-ware. Architecturally, Horkheimer (1944 : 42) has pointed out the very close resemblances to the frieze decoration on the small huaca next to the main Chotuna pyramid in the lower Lambayeque valley with those on the huaca Dragón. We cleared a few additional meters of the frieze in the outer court yard of the small pyramid, enough to show that it had a form somewhat analogous to the huaca Dragón (which the main Chotuna pyramid does not), and that the motives were obviously the same, although the placement and sequence varied. Motives which the Chotuna frieze has in common with el Dragón are : Horizontal I, II, III and IX.G Vertical I, and crude varia tion on the framing figure (PI. 28 a). Different motives are : a stylized bird, a three-toed and a five-toed serpentine creature (PI. 30). A similar structure, although apparently without friezes is Paredones (Kosok : 1959 : M-4). Other structures with a Dragón type plan may be found when buildings in Pacat namú, in the Jequetepeque valley, are cleared, but our rather thorough survey of main pyramids indicates that not many more are extant. The stucco decoration of the small huaca in the Chotuna group represents, as it did in the Moche valley, an interruption in the polychrome painted wall tradition. Carrion in the huaca Pintada, Kosok (1965 : 165 : fig. 39) and Florian in Batan Grande and Ford in the huaca Pintada (personal com munication) have referred to illustrated painted walls for the Lam bayeque which appear to be either late Mochica or Tiahuanacoid I-II. The sequel to the stucco relief in the Lambayeque area for wall decoration appears to be a return to polychrome painting, however, if a fragment of wall deco ration in el Purgatorio is typical (Schaedel : 1957 : fig. 7). Also, architectur ally, the late period sites, except for what I interpret as Chimu influence, do not develop the characteristic perimeter wall as in the Moche. Thus archi tecturally the Chotuna small huaca appears more intrusive in the Lambayeque than in the Moche. On the basis of architecture alone, then, arguments are equally good for deriving the Chotuna temple from the Dragón as vice versa. The ceramic traits of preference for utilitarian and decorated blackware and the intro duction of paddleware technique tend to weigh the scale in favor of a north south influence. The intrusive character of both temples can possibly be explained by a new line of evidence. We now discuss three dynasty origin legends, two relating to the Naym lap dynasty and the Chotuna complex (to which Rowe : 1948b and Kosok : 1959, have called attention), and one referring to Trujillo (again reported on by Rowe : 1948a et b and Kosok : 1965 : 73-74). In the former, if we fol low Kosok's supposition, the Naymlap group came from the north, presum ably coastal Ecuador and proceeded to rule people of the Lambayeque and Leche valleys with chieftains, beginning about 1,000 A.D. In the latter, a group also coming from the north arrived in the Moche and gradually conquered the valley.</page><page sequence="92">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 457 In the Naymlap story, certain aspects are indicated as diagnostic of the first ruler and his company. Among these are « trumpeters » who play upon certain great shells (strombus ?) « that are much esteemed by these Indians » ; the litter and throne ; a scatterer of the dust of sea shells ; a prince who wrought shirts and clothing of feathers. While fragmentary to be sure, it should be noted that the shells (strombus in particular) litters and feathering are all important elements of the basic huaca Dragón complex, which is so intimately related to the Chotuna huaca. Of Tacaynamo, much less is given in the source : (Vargas Ugarte : 1936) : In this house he remained for the space of one year performing... the said cere monies and of the communication he had with the Indians whom he was conquer ing he learned the language, and they obeyed him and gave him their daughters. It is not known from whence came this... except that he gave them to under stand that a great lord... was, had sent him to govern this land... from the other part of the sea. The yellow powders that he used in his ceremonies and then cotton cloths he wore to cover his shameful parts are well known on these lands and the balsa of logs is used on the coast of Payta and Tumbez... It is perhaps significant that yellow powder is mentioned since the pre vailing color of the walls of the huaca Dragón and the smaller huaca in Cho tuna are painted yellow. Also note reference to the breechclout which is part of the clothing of the processional figures of the huaca frieze. The si milar sea-route from the north of course tends to link the Moche and Lam bayeque legends. The legends also refer to linkages with the Guano Island apparatus of Kubler. The ochreous powder, shell deposits and throne elements are common to the legends and the Guano Island artifacts. Both the Naymlap and Tacaynamo legends refer to the first shrine as a « house », a term which we interpret to distinguish the compartmentalized structure from the massive platform pyramid. Iconographie Affiliations with Other Cultures. The huaca Dragón was clearly one of the most ornate temples of the period on the North Coast. It would appear to be aesthetically related to the ela borate baroque decoration on the middle Chimu-style pressed ware, known from the Supe to the Lambayeque, but it is the only representation of this style in architecture. There are many elements of Tiahuanaco design in the pressed ware decoration, ranging from the central figure of the sun door to serpent heads in sequence. Usually they can be classified as « Tiahuanaco derived » (Kroeber : 1944 : 67-68). Minor Tiahuanaco-derived motives occur in the huaca. The use of profile figures seems to be a blend of the Mochica figurai tradition with Tiahuanacoid iconography. Even such elements as the arc can be traced to Mochica prototypes in pottery rather than to a Tia huanacoid source. There are also motives that closely resemble Recuay cera mics and stone sculpture. The figures on the vertical panels, however, appear</page><page sequence="93">458 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES to be unique to the huaca as do the front face monster heads that « anchor » the arcs and the « wreath » motive combined with a pedestal. The iconography of the temple suggests a relatively eclectic religious cult which may have combined the deities from various regions. Assuming that this process of syncretism had already incorporated, during the earlier phases of the Tiahuanacoid period, the cosmology of the above-named cultures, we need only point out possible Ecuadorean connections for some of the unique elements. The pre-historic artifactual inventory for the later periods in coastal Ecua dor has only been cursorily reviewed, and the iconographie similarities with the huaca Dragon and the small Chotuna huaca suggest general qualities rather than specifics, like the connection Means (162-172) felt existed with his Tiahuanaco II. On the stone slabs of Cerro Jaboncillo, Manabí, there is a kind of swimming crab-like creature which might well be the prototype of one of our vertical panels. In one instance he is portrayed with a small figure like motive III between his tentacles (Saville : 1 : Plate 28). On the same figure the vertebra motive shows analogies to the trapezoidal segments of horizontal motive IX, G, and the small Chotuna huaca. The quadran gular sculpture that Saville described (1907 : 1 : 67) as being in the church at Picoaza and which is now in the Municipal Museum, contains on two sides representations of profile human figures that in general position and facial abnormalities suggest the framing motive on the Chotuna frieze. More general resemblances to helmeted seated figures roughly analogous to the wooden idols of the Dragón and Guano Islands are two stone statues from Cerro de Azúcar in Santa Helena (also in the Guayaquil Municipal Museum). Other individual similarities, such as the profile monkey, may be noted, but we are attempting here only to indicate that there is a basis in Ecuador for identifying some of the resemblances to the huaca iconography which seem alien to northern Peru. It is likely more artifactual resemblances can be found which should relate to both the Guano Island complex and to the Chotuna and Dragón complexes. Were it not for the unique character of the huaca and its contents, and also the close tie-up between the Chotuna group with the legend and its similarity to the Dragón, the three-way relationship of Lambayeque — Dra gón and Guano Islands all pointing to some further northern point for some of the influences would appear less singular. These facts, however, do seem to corroborate at the right point in time the likelihood that the huaca Dra gón was somehow related to the founder of the Chimu dynasty ; that the previous Naymlap dynasty in Lambayeque was somehow related to the founding of the Chimu dynasty in Moche, and that the Guano Islands were important either as way stations or cult centers to these dynasties or both.</page><page sequence="94">THE HUACA EL DRAGÓN 459 Chart 1 Frieze Panel sequence South side Motives — Mostly destroyed I, II, IV, V, VI I, II, III I, ?, II, IV, V I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII I, II, III, ?
