<plain_text><page sequence="1">Face as artifact ?n early Chinese art LADISLAV KESNER Among many definitions of the term "face" provided by the Webster dictionary of English, the first states that it is "the front part of the head"; only the sixth entry defines face as an "outward appearance." Yet when people look at and talk about faces in painting, sculpture, photography, and other art media, they automatically suppress the first meaning of this word in favor of the sixth: They routinely reduce face to only one of its aspects?an index of a concrete person. Consequently, both the practice and discourse on portraiture traditionally have been centered on the issue of "likeness." Using the conceptual structure of Chinese culture, one could say that the focus on the face as Han tends to obliterate the fact that a face is primarily something much broader?mian.^ There is a good reason for the popularity of interpreting "face" as "outward appearance." Faces reliably serve as a key to identification based on appearance, and it can justifiably be assumed that during the Bronze Age in China they did as well. As a fascinating body of recent research in neurosciences revealed, there are anatomically distinct, functionally defined areas within the human cortex, particularly in lateral fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal lobe, which are responsible for mediating facial identity (Benson and Perrett 1994; Perrett et al. 1995; Andrews and Ewbank 2004; Calder and Young 2005; Pourtois et al. 2005). It has been suggested that the face may have ontogenetically developed as a unique identifier of members of the same species, which may have enabled development of a more refined sense of individuality than has been previously possible (Cole 1998:45). Our habit of dealing with faces as signs, indexes of personal identity, makes it difficult to view the face without this reference to a particular (even though sometimes unknown) individual, to accept another notion of face? face as an artifact?as something artificially made with a view to subsequent use. However, it is not difficult to demonstrate that a face can serve as an artifact. The particular and famous face of Mao Zedong, long before it was literally solidified into the artifact by pathologists and embalmers, served as an efficient tool: an icon of political power, persuasion, intimidation (fig. 1). Yet at the same time, it was never evacuated from its primary signifying function. Quite to the contrary, its instrumental potency?whether in the context of a Maoist cult, as a miraculously potent ?mage, or as a recycled ?con in the context of contemporary art?was and, even ?n the mausoleum, remains inseparable from its primary function as a signal of personal identity.2 Faces of anonymous mourners passing the catafalque in the Mao mausoleum perform the dual role as well: They point to their individuality and, at the same time, serve as an efficient tool, displaying an expression appropriate or required in the given situation. In this essay, I want to further develop the notion of the face as an artifact and to look at several examples that prompt us to take such a concept in a literal sense: These are faces without any claim to individuality and personal (metaphysical) identity; faces, that did not come into existence by recording features of any individual (living or imagined) beings.3 I shall argue that far from being idiosyncratic exceptions, such "artifacted faces" seem to constitute a persistent idiom, or convention, running through the history of early Chinese art and reappearing in its later stages. I hope to demonstrate that the existence of such faces challenges us to revise some generally accepted notions of the development of This is a much-expanded version of a paper originally presented at UCLA and Princeton University in 1998 and at the conference "Bodies and Faces in Chinese Visual Culture/' organized by the Department of Art History at the University of Chicago in April 1998. I am grateful for the comments of the audience and for helpful suggestions by two anonymous reviewers of this paper. 1. For a discussion of Chinese concepts of face and distinctions between Han and mian, see Hu 1944; Cheng 1986; Zito 1994:119 120. The social implications and connotations of the terms Han and mian stem from their basic grammatical difference. As Cheng notes, Han is always used as a noun referring specifically to the concrete physiognomic face, whereas mian (though it can be used as a noun denoting physiognomic face) is more generally used to refer to the frontal surface of a thing, an event, or a person (Cheng 1986:331). 2. For the intended uses and unintended effects of reproductions of Mao's face in the context of his cult and contemporary art, see Barm? 1986 and sources quoted therein. 3. On various conceptions of personal identity, issues of relationships between biological individuals and social persons, and fusion of personal identity and societal role, see, among others, Parfit 1986. Shoemaker and Swinburne (1989:49-51) stress that while most theories of personal identity are based on our understanding of brain and memory continuity, the most frequent empirical test is similarity of visual appearance.</page><page sequence="2">34 RES 51 SPRING 2007 Figure 1. The body of Mao Zedong in a mausoleum (photographer unknown). portraiture in China. Finally, from a much broader perspective, these ?mages of faces add an interesting dimension to the question that is far from obvious: What is the enigmatic entity we call a face? Case study I: Face imagery in the art of the Bronze Age Despite the longstanding claim that early Chinese art is depersonalized, a face/mask is actually quite visible in material records of various Neolithic cultures, both in the Central Plain and in the southern areas, as well as in the art of the Bronze Age.4 Isolated examples of ceramic or bone objects in the shape of anthropomorphic heads were recovered from sites of many regional Neolithic cultures, such as Hemudu, Cishan-Peiligang, Daxi, Yangshao, or northeastern Hongsan culture.5 Most often, such heads originally topped ceramic vessels, and it seems that their primary function was to embellish or animate the surface or to draw attention to a particular vessel.6 In most cases, it is the facial part that is elaborated and given prominence; in some instances, the head is effectively reduced to a three-dimensional face, which thus actually stands for the head. Extremely stylized painted masks/faces whose possible symbolic meaning remains unclear adorn bowls from Banpo site of Yangshao culture (see, for example, Jiang 1988). As can be expected with images from different regional origins and contexts of use, these various faces project a broad range of stylistic and expressive possibilities. Another instance of exploitation of the facial idiom can be seen in what Chinese archaeologists dubbed "ghost faces"?holes and ridges on the feet of ceramic tripods of the late Neolithic cultures?which indeed incite the viewer to project imaginatively a "face" into the structural configuration of the vessel. Such vaguely defined faces could animate a static object (quite possibly even in symbolic terms, with the "face" transforming the vessel into a seat of a supernatural being). Among the most interesting are some instances of Neolithic artifacts where alternative renderings of the frontaHy displayed face/mask appear. On the outer perimeter of an engraved bone tube, alterations of a line serve to produce three distinct faces, which could be alternately explained as depicting three distinct beings, or a transformation of a single entity, or as an expressive permutation of a single face (fig. 2). These ?mages might have had a symbolic meaning or could serve purely a 4. In some cases of the Neolithic and Bronze Age imagery discussed here, the reference could be either to a biological face or a mask. However, in the context of the present discussion, it is not necessary to distinguish strictly between the two, because the mask can be considered as one aspect of the broader phenomenon of faciality with which we are concerned here. Likewise, while this text intentionally focuses on representation of the face, it should be noted that many of the faces discussed here originally came with a body. The editors of a recent volume on the body and face in Chinese visual culture rightly noted that the "face" and "body" constitute two often separated topoi of scholarly examination, which are often linked in continuing negotiations (Wu andTsiang 2005:4). 5.

Mask/face-like motifs are especially prominent on jade plaques and other jade artifacts from the Late Neolithic East Coast Liangzhu culture. Various versions of the mask- or face-like idiom?ranging from very abstract models to quite elaborate and specified designs?occupy the central role in the imagery that constitutes the surface decoration of Liangzhu jades. Some Liangzhu objects juxtapose two distinct facial renderings: an anthropomorphic face superimposed over an animal/monster face; elsewhere (such as on the trapezoidal plaque from Fanshan, fig. 3) the frontal face is flanked by two profile heads, with faces crowned by elaborate headgear (Beijing 1990a; Yang 1999:117-135 with further bibliography). In other late Eastern Neolithic cultures, the so-called "demonic imagery," consisting of many variations of a frontal face with allusions to anthropomorphic features, developed and flourished until the early Western Zhou period (fig. 4)7 A very similar idiom of the frontal face or mask reappears as a principal decorative scheme on ritual bronze vessels, as well as on bone, ivory, stone, ceramic, lacquer, and wooden artifacts, and on architectural elements during the early stage of the Bronze Age period, the Shang dynasty. It was suitable to the process of drawing in a mold, to subtractive technologies of wood or stone carving, and to additive procedures of inlay and mosaic compositions in architectural structures. The typical taotie (or shoumian, Figure 3. Jade plaque with the motifs of theriomorphic and anthropomorphic faces. Excavated at Yaoshan, Yuhang, Zhejiang province.

As a prime example of the widely distributed facial motif in Shang art, the "monster mask" merits discussions at least on two accounts. Firstly, there is a notable disjunction between the ubiquitous presence of the motif and indeterminacy of its reference. More or less informed speculations on its meaning abound and some scholars still seem to adhere to the notion that the exact reference of the image might be established.10 While there is no need here to delve into the complicated issue of the iconography of Shang imagery, it will suffice to note that it is quite possible that the monster mask bears no direct and specific iconographie connotations to the preexisting model and that the image is basically self-referential. The central significance of the motif seems to lie in its expressive potential, in its ability to be displayed in various viewing and functional contexts. Whatever other specific meaning and functions such images could have had, their efficiency almost certainly depended on the psychological power and assertiveness of the frontally displayed face/mask. It is possible to suppose that the emergence of the fully-fledged monster mask in the Anyang period indicates the establishment of a self referential image, displaying (both in the strict sense of being laid out against the surface and in the sense of imagistic conception) and thus projecting a high degree of visual and cognitive uniformity. By way of analogy, one could argue that in fact the representational function itself, the capacity of the image for morphological adjustment in so many different contexts, was achieved at the expense of iconography?that is, at the expense of its capability to denote specific entities or concepts.11 Secondly, this iconographie indeterminacy seems to be closely related to the means by which the image has been assembled. The emergence of the fully-fledged monster mask, which can be observed on vessels from the late Shang (Yinxu II ) period?for example, Fu Hao (Si Tu mu) da fanghu (M5:807), or Shanghai museum's Ya hu fanglei?is tied to a technological matrix, to the development of a system of interchangeable units (fig. 5). These facial parts can be seen as composite building blocks, which could be recombined and thus permitted a seemingly endless variety. Fully-fledged monster masks are typically composed of a vocabulary of "anatomical parts" whose differing morphologies and their combinations create specific instances of the motif of a face, suitable to the demands of a particular structural arrangement of the vessel or other objects on which it appears.12 The monster mask/face is thus modulated in accordance with the needs of particular spatial constraints of its placement or recomposed from a stock of interchangeable components. Other variations of the face/mask idiom appear in all kinds of media and contexts in Shang and early Western Zhou art. In addition to faces that hover intermittently between anthropo- and theriomorphism, such as the ones on the lids of the famous set of three fang hu vessels from the Nezu Museum, explicitly anthropomorphic faces appear as well.13 The most striking Shang face imagery can now be associated with highly stylized heads on bronze anthropomorphic sculptures, and masks with plastically rendered pupils, from the sites of Sanxingdui culture in Sichuan (fig. 6).14 Elsewhere, faces usually are depicted on weapons and chariot fittings?sometimes alluding to masks, presumably to be donned on specific occasions?or in small bone and jade carvings.15 Some of these 9. The best treatment of the evolution of animal motif design on Shang bronzes remains Bagley 1987. 10. For the issue of "meaning" of the monster mask see, among others, Hayashi 1986; various contributions in Whitfield 1992; Kesner 1991; Allan 1991. 11. Farris (1983:95-99) notes that in the art of Indians from the American Northwestern coast, the demand for increasingly elaborate display created a situation in which iconographie sense was lost or compromised. Animal identity became absolutely secondary to the display function and the permutations of forms finally obliterated meaning in representation. 12. Lothar Ledderose (Ledderose 2000) discusses bronze vessels as an early instance of a modular system in Chinese art. 13. It is doubtful whether the differences between these various renderings of more human heads in Shang art can be accounted for in terms of semantically charged typologies, or different stylistic sources (as some authors seem to suggest, Rawson 1996:115-116). 14. Sanxingdui finds have been extensively published in, for example, Chen (1994) and Bagley (2001). For possible significance of various Sanxingdui faces and motives of exaggerated eyes, see Wu (1997). Eye motif on artifacts from Sanxingdui culture sites has been discussed by Wu (ibid.) who suggests that the function of such objectivized eyes was to instill awe in the observer. 15. For overview, see Xu (1996); Yang (1988b:19-21, pis. 37, 128-134, 166, 239-240); some examples are discussed in Rawson (1996:114-116).</page><page sequence="5">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 37 4$$&gt;:/r'? &lt;M5:8p7?

After Yinxu Fu Hao mu (Beijing, 1980). faces/masks might have had a definite iconographie and symbolic meaning for their patrons or audiences. However, they often strike the observer as strangely indeterminate, which is perhaps best demonstrated by the four faces adorning sides of the famous He da fang ding allegedly from Huangcai, Ningxiang (fig. 7).16 Ito Michiharu has noted that these faces exude an uncanny, almost ghastly air of blankness, and characterizes Shang ?mages of faces as lacking in expression, showing no trace of mental activity (Ito 1989). Faces on this fang ding, allowing for a certain amount of distortion to fit them into respective compartments of the vessel and for the fact that they possess horns and claws, are nevertheless distinctly anthropomorphic and human Figure 6. 7aof/e monster mask on fang lei bronze vessel, 1100s-1000s b.c.

Whether they were intended to represent some particular entity?for example, a supernatural power? obviously cannot be ascertained. What should be noted, rather, is the fact that despite clear articulation of these faces, they do not point even to any generic identity. The power of such an image seems to stem from the way it asserts itself in its unspecificity. Impossibility of establishing specific references for these theriomorphic and anthropomorphic faces should not, of course, categorically imply that there were no such links in the minds of those who commissioned, made, and used them. However, all evidence points to the fact that the dominating presence of hieratic face imagery in the early Bronze Age art of China?in contrast to other 16.

Case study II: Zhaomian from Western Zhou tombs In subsequent phases of the Bronze Age, human ?mages can be encountered, usually on small utilitarian artifacts, but they are not very prominent.17 Many individuals and historical personalities are evoked by inscriptions on surfaces of vessels and bells, yet these persons are nowhere to be seen in visual representation, a fact to which we shall return shortly. But a very specific and elaborately rendered human face appears on a specific group of mortuary artifacts, the so-called zhaomian or fumian face-covers. The earliest examples have been unearthed from tombs datable to the tenth century and most came from the Western Zhou period. Some of the most impressive pieces were retrieved from the recently excavated late Western Zhou cemetery of Jin state atTianma-Qucun, Shanxi (fig. 8). It is difficult to judge from the archaeological context how precisely these covers were used. Most presumably, such plaques were sewn on to a textile shroud placed over the face of a deceased person. In some cases, these face covers formed an upper part of a kind of jade veil, which covered the body from head to toe. While it is obvious 17. To give one example, among some 2,700 objects recovered from the Western Zhou cemetery at Baoji, human figure?rather summarily rendered?appears on only three objects (Lu and Hu 1988:2:pls. 23-24, 169,216).</page><page sequence="7">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 39 Figure 8.

In the case of a face cover, found inside tomb M31 at Tianma Qucun, no fewer than thirty-nine pieces of jade that form the outer parameter of the face were found, while the other forty pieces were used to construct the face itself in an exactly symmetrical fashion (fig. 9). The whole "?mage" was assembled out of a number of individual pieces, some of which?such as plaques for eyes, mouth, and nose?were created specifically for this purpose by being carved to represent facial features. However, other plaques, in the shape of highly stylized dragons and animals, must originally have been created for a different use and recycled to compose such a face. The demarcation by the outer perimeter itself is telling: It defines a field, or a site, in which a face can be put together like a jigsaw puzzle. But that was no mere incidental play?if the sheer amount of work necessary to cut, polish, and embellish all these jade pieces is taken into account, it becomes obvious that these must surely have been some of the most labor-demanding and costly depictions of faces ever created. Even among the rather limited number of these jade covers, one can observe a considerable variety in the rendering of the faces, ranging from more naturalistic ones?such as the set from M2001 at Shangcunling, Sanmenxia, with some individual pieces specifically cut to suggest anatomical parts?to more abstract ones (fig. 18. For an introduction to the jade face covers, see Wang and Liu (1996). Wu Hung suggests another possible function for these covers: to hide the face in rigor mortis, or early stages of decay (Wu Hung, personal communication). For a different view on the link between Western Zhou jade veils and Han jade suits, see Rawson in Yang (1999:251) and Xu (1996).</page><page sequence="8">40 RES 51 SPRING 2007 Figure 9.

In two previously discussed examples, individual jade artifacts were arranged to represent basic anatomical parts, which provide the faces with their substance. In contrast, the zhaomian recovered from the Western Han tomb of the duke of Jibei state at Shuangru shan in Shandong displays a face as a compact surface, with only "ears" and "nose" specifically represented by jade pieces, while eyes and mouth are suggested by negative spaces, in between adjoining parts. In both cases, however, the viewer (even if by "viewer" we only mean the artisans themselves) must supply the details of the face from imagination to make such an image represent the face. Most importantly, the variation of individual renderings notwithstanding, none of the jade covers bear any attempted relation to the physical resemblance of the deceased person. Such characteristics of zhaomian covers seem to be determined by their specific function: Unlike the</page><page sequence="9">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 41 Figure 10. Reconstructed jade face-cover from Western Han tomb at Zifangshan, Xuzhou, 200s-0 B.c. After Wenwu (Beijing), no. 4(1993), p. 47. mortuary masks in some other ancient cultures, here there was no need to preserve the physical features of the deceased. Possibly, the jade faces could have instilled a sense of awe in people or spirits who approached the wearer, thus protecting the person in the afterlife (Rawson in Yang 1999:251). In the absence of written evidence, we cannot establish whether some further, more specific metaphysical ideas underlied their use in mortuary rituals?if there was belief in some negotiation between the actual physical face of the deceased and his/her jade face for eternity. But this only underscores the fact that the depicted "face" could become something very distant from a representation of the face of a concrete person. In order to create such a face?to select, or cut anew, all the individual plaques and to assemble them together?one does not start from a real face of a particular deceased individual, whose likeness should be preserved or transmitted, but with a rather different mental model. Whoever commissioned and created these objects operated with a notion of a face as a thing ontologically separated from the appearance, a sign of the specific person. Rather than trying to fix a transient appearance in a permanent image?which is basically the aim of any portraitist?the point of departure was the face as an artificial, symmetrical, and ordered construct. The face was put together as an artifact, itself composed of many components. And in the process of creating such a thing, the notion of the face as independent of the individual would be cemented and perpetuated. Various objects and images discussed so far point to a recurrent pattern. An image of a face, or more generally, what can be called a face-like idiom, was quite widespread in the Neolithic and Bronze Age art of China. These various faces were always deployed and used within the ritual and mortuary context, where they performed specific functions?decorative, apotropaic, protective. But they were never used to establish a link between an individuality and an identity of a specific being?whether human or supernatural?by approximating the likeness of a person or at least by being part of representation in which such link is established by other means. On artifacts recovered from the Neolithic and Bronze Age sites, the face exists and develops separately from any referential claims to personal identity. On another occasion, I have remarked on the absence of images of supernatural (ancestral) and real authorities and their activities in ancient Chinese art, which forms a striking contrast to other early societies (Kesner 1995:130). While ancestors were the prime object of ritual reverence and worship since the late Neolithic, and while the strategic role of ancestor worship in ancient Chinese society is well attested, it remains a paradoxical fact that during the Bronze Age at least, ancestors were represented by either the most iconic means (through a living impersonator?shi) or through the most abstract means (a naming inscription), but not pictorial or plastic means of depiction.19 Recently, Lothar von Falkenhausen has made an attempt to account for this absence of ?mages of rulers or ruling lineage ancestors in ancient Chinese art, suggesting that such highly placed human beings might have been too important to permit representation, which diminished the aura of person. Hence a kind of taboo on portraiture might have ensued. He also underscored that the Shang and Zhou favored written modes of transmission in conceptualizing important people and deities (Falkenhausen n.d.). While these ritual constraints?where metaphysical concerns intersected with politics?undoubtedly constitute a partial explanation for a different regime of the face in ancient China, one should not view them as 19. Wu Hung (2002) has recently discussed another strategy of non-iconic representation?we/(presentation or positioning)?in which the subject (such as a tomb master in some Han dynasty tombs) was represented within the space of the tomb through framing rather than by being portrayed.</page><page sequence="10">42 RES 51 SPRING 2007 Figure 11.

Photo by the author. a one-way influence upon the material culture and visual depictions. The representational practice of exploiting, manipulating, and constructing faces as frontal parts of objects,, putting them to various uses and contexts, might in itself have contributed to diminishing the comprehension of the face as a signal of personal identity and have influenced the evolution of ritual and metaphysical conceptions that inhibited the need for depicting human or supernatural subjectivity. Case study III: Tomb figures Toward the end of the Bronze Age, in the late Eastern Zhou period, a great acceleration in figurai art occurs, which can be seen within the context of major change from hieratic to pictorial art. One of the features of this development is the introduction of tomb figures and other models that appear in tombs from the fifth and sixth centuries b.c. onward as a part of a new strategy to create a tomb as a microcosmic replica of the earthly realm of the deceased.20 Most of the earliest examples are associated with burial customs of Chu, Qin, and Qi states. On some of these wooden figurines, facial features are prominently modelled and sometimes treated with natural pigments used to delineate anatomical details, including pupils of the eyes. Some of the most articulated examples came from recently excavated late Warring States tombs in Mashan, Yutaishan, Baoshan, and Wuchang, Jiangling.21 The consistent and explicit care given to the articulation of the face attests to its newly emerging role: The human face was a new territory where possibilities of expression would be explored and played out. Carefully articulated facial features animate figurines and consolidate their typological qualities. Some of the masterfully rendered examples, such as the figure of a lady with a pensive look from the late Eastern Zhou tomb at Changtaiguan, Xianyang, prompt contemporary viewers to attribute expression of emotions to a face, yet it remains questionable whether, at this stage, any mental states were intentionally depicted.22 Neither is 20. For the most recent and comprehensive account of this development, see Falkenhausen (2006:293-325). 21. For figures from Yutaishan, see Beijing (1984:113, pis. 70-71); for Wuchang Wenwu 1989 (3):18; for figures from Baoshan, Beijing (1991:1:254-257; 2:pls. 14, 84); for Mashan, see Beijing (1985:pl. 31). 22. The interpretation of facial features in this case (as in sculpture generally), depends on the actual condition of observation, such as an angle of view, quality of light and shade, etc. In photographic reproductions especially, the effect of light and shade imbues such plastic forms with expressive qualities not intended by makers and</page><page sequence="11">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 43 there any indication to suggest that this specific treatment was intended to convey a distinct personal appearance. Chu figurines from late Warring States shortly predate another prominent instance of face creation in early Chinese art: the figures from the terracotta army buried near the mausoleum of the First Emperor of Qin at Lintong near Xian (fig. 11). As is well known, in three subterranean pits more than seven thousand soldiers stand in battle formation, holding real weapons. The stunning degree to which the features of figures are elaborated and the differences perceived have led many authors to suggest that the figures were modelled upon living soldiers, that they were actual portraits. But they are not. In fact, despite their seemingly individualized features, most of these faces can best be described as an aggregation of prefabricated expressive units, a result of serial production. The sculptors worked with a repertoire of mold-made components, such as noses, mouths, eyebrows, moustaches, etc.; each individual appearance was assembled through combination of these basic components, followed by the finishing of details by hand.23 This attitude toward the construction of the face?something that could be called "editing" of faces?seems to be an extension, in different media and contexts, of the approach to the visualizing of the face, which we observed on the jade face-covers. The most striking aspect of this complex work of representation is the concentrated effort to individualize each figure, expressed in a very peculiar fashion. In the entire army, there was no attempt to articulate the personal identity of any soldier?not even of the high ranking officers, which could easily have been done with the help of naming inscriptions, for example. The same is true of other sculptures found in the vicinity of the mausoleum, such as figures of servants, musicians, and acrobats (Beijing 2000). What mattered within the confines of the underground realm were those aspects that made each figure a constitutive component of the whole?the function of the figure as it was embodied in its position, gesture, and stances. The postures and gestures spatially embodied and defined the most typical, meaningful configurations in which the function of the individual within the unit was enacted. Figure 12. Figure of a lady excavated in 1959 at Zhangjiazhuang, Xiaoji, 200s-100s b.c., h. 13 cm. After Kaogu (Beijing), no. 7(1960), pi. 2. But then, what was the role of the face? Why were not all the faces rendered in the stereotypical, undifferentiated, or at least less particular manner, if other figurai aspects carry the reference? As I have suggested elsewhere, facial diversity was essential for creating and enhancing the effect of difference. In a composite portrait of the entire army and within the spatial contiguity of figures of the same types, the face, differentiated from the surrounding faces, helps to install the authenticity of each figure as a distinctive entity (fig. 12). And precisely because these faces do not carry the burden of reference to actual people, they could be manipulated relentlessly and assembled from a stock of prefabricated expressive units.24 their patrons and seduce contemporary viewers into attributing to them certain emotional qualities. 23. Ledderose (2000:esp. 70-73) stresses that only production based on mass assembly of prefabricated modules could make possible the manufacture of such an enormous quantity of diverse figures. 24. For an extended discussion of this issue, see Kesner 1995; for many details of faces of Qin warriors, see Zhang and Yang 1994, among others.</page><page sequence="12">44 RES 51 SPRING 2007 In these early tomb sculptures, the manufactured faces (which previously existed mostly as hieratic, symmetrical constructs laid against the surface of a pictorial medium or, in the case of zhaomian, against a body), are for the first time integrated with the represented bodies. But within this organic unity of face and body the sculptures retain their iconic orientation by directly confronting the viewer (with a few exceptions, such as the figures of standing and kneeling archers from the terracotta army, with their heads turned sideward). Only in a subsequent development of tomb sculpture, a relaxing of the frontal, iconic position appears more frequently, which is apparent in various configurations of the head and the face, dictated by the typological requirements of a given figure. Later, from the Western Han period onward, tomb figures become a standard part of funerary assemblages, which make them into one of the greatest galleries of human faces ever created in art. Most of these figures were mold-produced, but some were hand-modelled and in many instances there was a visible and remarkable sensitivity to the modelling of the face? indeed, some of these faces could be informed by the physical appearances of real people. Ceramic sculptures from tombs dating to the second century b.c. often display previously unknown mastery of psychological realism, as evidenced, for example, by solemn, introspective faces of attendants from the tomb of the Empress Dou at Renjiapo near Xian, datable to 135 B.c. (fig. 13).25 Here?for the first time in Chinese art and certainly much earlier than in painting?the faces have become (to adapt Harry Berger Jr/s apt phrase) "the indexes of the mind's ability to make the face the index of the mind" (Berger 1994:97).26 Faces of these figures anticipate in a remarkable way the development of interest in human individuality, evident in their striving to express the inner spiritual essence beyond the physiognomic configuration. Already these small and unassuming ceramic effigies from Western Han tombs display qualities required of a portrait several centuries later by a famous painter Gu Kaizhi (344-403) who defined the essence of portraiture as chuanshen xiezhao or "transmission of the soul through the depiction of outer appearance." Similar attention to the facial expression can be observed among more than six hundred figures from pits surrounding Emperor Jing's (ruled in 156-141 b.c.) and Empress Wang's mausoleum ofYangling (Chongqing 2001:1-11; Wang 1992:8-13). Compared to a Qin emperor's terracotta warriors, here modelling of heads concerns not so much the iconic details of headgears or moustaches, but more animated expressions on their round faces. Despite their wonderfully subtle and nuanced individualized expressions, they have been constructed from a set of physiognomic and expressive variables and cannot be seen as representing individual features of specific individuals. Among tomb figures of the later period, one can find numerous examples of an extremely sensitive modeling of the face, which becomes an effective instrument, a suitable surface for display of expressions and emotions required for a given figure type or an action depicted. The face as an elastic expressive field is stretched to its limits and relentlessly exploited?for example, in expressive exaggerations and facial ferocity of the figures of warriors and soldiers from the period of the Wei dynasty and beyond. Fleeting passions and transitory states of mind are captured with utmost attention: Dignified restraint radiates from the face of a Confucian official, detached aloofness is eloquently captured in the face of a court lady, sad resignation permeates the facial expression of a servant dwarf. In each case, these masterful facial renderings help to install their bearer as a distinct entity of a certain type or rank and to strengthen the typological nature of the image.27 On some figurines, individual nuances of rendering the face?corresponding usually to similarly treated details of garments?unmistakably betray real, perceptually observed differences.28 One is tempted to assume such figures might portray specific individuals, yet in the absence of naming inscriptions or any any other conclusive link, there is no individual person to be identified as a model.29 As we can see, in early Chinese art the idiom of the face was widely exploited and utilized. Indeed, there may be more faces there than in any other artistic 25. For the tomb of Empress Dou, see Wang and Wu 1976. 26. However, the figures of the same period can also have articulated, yet essentially immobile, expressionless faces (see Pair of Dancers published in Kaikodo Journal XV [Spring 2000]:cat. nr. 43). This diversity of face renditions within a given period points to stylistic differences, a subject that is beyond the scope of the present article. 27. It should be noted that?in tomb figures specifically?there is almost always a perfect correspondence between the face and the body. There is little evidence of forceful negotiation, tension, or disjunction between them, but rather a seamless interaction. 28. Compare, for example, two figures of officials from Sui tomb at Xiangjin, Hunan, dating from 610-611 A.D. (Wenwu 1981 [4]). 29. It remains unclear whether some of the figures might have been conceived as portraits of specific people (Kesner 1991).</page><page sequence="13">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 45 Figure 13.

On the one hand, representations of faces from other ancient cultures?Egyptian, Near Eastern, or Mayan?were intended mostly as depictions of real people and often were specifically commissioned to convey the likeness of a given God, ruler, or a historically known person, even though they may not be visually specific. On the other hand, in early China, these faces never referred to a particular person in a sense of pointing to a particular metaphysical being, even though the artisans would have been technically perfectly capable of the degree of differentiation necessary to create a veritable likeness. These are, properly speaking, the faces of no one. And precisely because such representations of faces were exempt from the usual business of indexical reference to personal identity, they were so effectively put into various uses outlined above. The evidence from the Bronze Age and early imperial art thus seems to suggest a much broader conception of the face?not as a sign to be recorded, but rather a surface, a site to be fashioned (molded, constructed) to fulfill a desired purpose?in short, the face as an artifact. The recurrence of the idiom of "face as artifact" in later Chinese art We will now have to move?albeit briefly?further in time to substantiate the claim that such a mode of construction of the face and its underlying conception were available as visual and conceptual conventions in later periods of Chinese art, and that this mode participated in the subsequent development of representational strategies for the visual enactment of personhood and individual subjectivity. It is now commonly agreed that the first ?mages that were intended to depict individuals, and thus could be called portraits in an established sense of the term, were found on painted banners from the late Eastern Zhou and early Western Han periods, the most famous being the person on the banner from the Mawangdui tomb No. 1, generally identified to be the tomb occupant Lady Dai. However, her appearance was not visually transcribed though the rendering of her features; her face did not contribute to revealing her individuality and identity, which was conveyed contextually.30 In this respect, this image could be seen as paradigmatic for many later Chinese portraits, from wall paintings on Han and Jin tombs to many instances of later portraits of famous scholars and historical figures. The identity of the individuals was enacted through a particular context (topos or mode of behavior)?as demonstrated in portraits of tomb occupants from Eastern Han tombs;31 in the oldest dated portrait in Chinese art (230 a.D.);32 in 30. Wu Hung (1992:121-122) suggests that the figure on the banner was intended to represent Lady Dai's existence in the afterworld, rather than constituting a portrait of the subject's earthly life. Standing in for name inscriptions that usually appeared on such funerary banners, the image nonetheless served to identify the deceased person. 31. For example, the portrait of a tomb master from a tomb at Anping, Hebei province (Beijing 1990b:tab. 40), or the portrait of one Bu Qianjiu and his wife from a tomb in Luoyang (Wenwu 1977 [6]:1-11). 32. This is a painting on a wooden panel, presumably from a tomb. An accompanying inscription identifies the depicted person as a certain Chou Lu, military official in Huqiang district (now Gansu province), see Kaikodo Journal (spring 1997):cat. no. 1.</page><page sequence="14">46 RES 51 SPRING 2007 tomb reliefs depicting the so-called Seven Sages of Bamboo Grove;33 or in figures painted on the famous lacquered chest from the Eastern Han tomb in Lo-lang (Chosen Koseki Kenkyu-kai 1934:pl. 48). The extant works of art?mostly tomb murals and painting on wood from the Six Dynasties and the Tang periods?attest that in painting, too, the sensibility toward the face gradually developed, following precedents set in tomb sculpture. There is also some anecdotal evidence to suggest the growing importance of physical likeness as an important criterion for the success of the portrait and the figurai image. Thus, for instance, the Northern Wei dynastic annals record the story of the fourth ruler Qian Fei Di who had representations of his grandfather and father painted at all dynastic shrines. He subsequently inspected the images in shrines, pointing out inadequacies in physical likeness ("he had a great pimply nose?why aren't there any here"), and had painters correct the portraits (Soper 1967:17-18). The development of portraiture in painting and further differentiation of this genre were probably also influenced by painting theories of the Six Dynasties period, which stated that the main task of the portrait painter lay in capturing the inner spirit or spiritual vitality (shenqi) of a person. It is beyond the scope of this essay to attempt even a cursory summary of the development of portraiture in later periods.34 Suffice it to acknowledge here that a trend toward differentiation among various types of portraiture can be detected from the Five Dynasties period onward and, at the same time, there was a growing attention to physiognomic appearance and its rendering in an acceptable likeness. This is most visible in commemorative portraits, such as, for example, a series of the Five Old Men of Suiyang, dated to 1056 A.D. (Fong 1994:44-46). In the Song imperial portraiture, the represented face is called on to perform the dual role of likeness and allusion to the presence of an imperial authority.35 Patricia Ebrey, who has reconstructed the practice of the Song imperial portrait sculptures used in ancestral rites (none of which survives), quotes contemporary textual accounts, which record instances of emotional response to portraits of imperial ancestors. She concludes that recognizable likeness was an important feature of such effigies (Ebrey 1997:83; 1999:81). However, in most post-Song portraits of scholars, many of which certainly were intended to convey a personal identity of a particular living person or a historical figure of bygone ages, the role of the face is mostly and decidedly secondary, not directly contributing to the indexing function of the image, which is conveyed through context, garment, and other symbols of rank, or action. The rise of literati aesthetics with its anti-mimetic rhetoric in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries reinforced the notion that the painter's primary task is to capture the inner spirit or harmony of the portrayed person (yun). The way in which the rendering of the face revealed a metaphysical identity of a depicted subject differed substantially according to the type and functional context of a given image. Some of the most elaborate faces can be found in Buddhist sculpture, particularly in commemorative portraits (ding xiang), which probably have developed from the practice of cultic worship of mummified bodies and relics of important monks. They often combine extreme naturalism with formal demeanor and were created after the death of the subject with the explicit aim of preserving his likeness for future generations (Croissant 1990; Foulk and Sharf 1994:165-169).3* The expressive potential of the face continued to be most fully explored and utilized within the context of religious and ritual painting and sculpture. The example of a wooden figure of Kasyapa?the eldest of Buddha's disciples?datable to the late eleventh century, well underscores this point (fig. 14).37 A viewer's gaze and attention are arrested immediately by the mastery of psychological realism in the old man's face. It is conceivable that such a face was informed by the physical appearance of a real person?an old monk? but it is still a "portrait" of a particular mental state and character associated with Buddha's followers, rather than an intended likeness of a specific person. Again stripped of its signifying function to refer to a particular person, such a face can all the more effectively fulfill the 33. These reliefs are the subject of a monograph by Audrey Spiro (1990). 34. For a concise overview of the development of portraiture in China prior to 1600, see Vinograd 1992:18-27. 35. For the Song imperial portraits, see Fong and Watt 1996: 141-145. 36. The increased attention to facial physiognomies is likewise apparent in wooden mannequins unearthed from several early twelfth century Liao tombs in Northwestern China, although it is not obvious that these mannequins indeed have "distinctive physical features that correlate with the specific identities of the tomb occupants," as has been recently suggested (Shen 2005:101). 37. The facial rendering of this sculpture, which originally may have formed a part of the larger set, relates it to a group of ceramic sculptures of luohans from Yixian, five of which survive in various museums.</page><page sequence="15">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 47 desired function?convey emotions or expressions appropriate for the typological social identity that the ?mage projects. The emphasis on the face as a sign of a concrete person, the index of personal identity, seems to gain a new prominence in painting from the Middle Ming dynasty onward, which is especially evident in commemorative and ancestral portraits.38 It is not easy to explain the emergence of these much more specific, holistically conceived likenesses at this point. Richard Vinograd noted that from the mid-sixteenth century onward, both the number and the expressive range of Chinese portrait paintings increased dramatically. He related this development to the evolving awareness of individualism and self-expression in the consciousness of the elite, which permeated Ming society in that period (Vinograd 1992:1, 29). In a similar vein, Hajime Nakatani diagnosed an enduring sensibility for human appearance in late imperial China, which gradually unraveled. He rightly pointed out that this transformation in apprehending human appearance had been reflected in other fields of representation, such as physiognomy and novels (Nakatani 1996).39 Among the most powerful instances of this increased focus on the face are some rare Ming commemorative portraits, particularly those representing old women. Even in these portraits, the reference to a particular person is still constructed by the garment, pose, and context. But powerful verism strongly suggests that the face is a sign of the person's identity and individuality. These faces are devoid of any idealization; they are strikingly candid in transcriptions of the appearance? some of them looking almost like postmortem masks, evoking the presence of specific individuals (fig. 15). Faced with such a powerful record of the visual exigencies of a face, one cannot assume anything but a desire to create an effigy of a concrete person. At the same time, these portraits continue to be effective as artifacts: They are imbued with an aura of ritual reverence and seriousness, eliciting a sense of awe, and they easily count as some of the most effective and powerful portraits in the entire history of Chinese art.40 Many portraits of this type represent women, a fact that Figure 14. Luohan (Kasyapa?), late 1000s-1100s, h. 99 cm. Photo ? 2006 National Gallery, Prague. would require some further examination vis-?-vis some recorded statements against the display of posthumously painted portraits of women.41 A similar preoccupation with details of individual physiognomies permeates some other Ming paintings, which may have functioned outside the framework of commemorative rituals. A good example of this type of image can be found, for instance, in the album of eminent men from Zhejiang, now at Nanjing Museum.42 38. The paintings discussed here are undated but can nevertheless be placed in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. 39. In the physiognomic practice of this time, Nakatani specifically mentions an obsessive interest in details of facial parts (Nakatani 1996:10, 19-20; 1998:11 -12; also Siggstedt 1991.) 40. Steven Little (1999) discussed some outstanding examples of memorial portraits of eminent Ming personalities, some of which can be reliably dated to the second half of the fifteenth century. 41. Zhu Xi in his Family rituals warns explicitly that creating a posthumous likeness of women could constitute a gross violation of rituals. Clunas discusses the issues of men looking at the faces of women; of the correct mimesis; and of women as reflected in some Ming literary sources (Clunas 1997:89-93). 42. James Cahill has mentioned the extraordinary realism of these paintings. He has suggested that they probably served as sketches for more idealized formal portraits, where the highly individualized likenesses would be "tamed" (Cahill 1994:90-91).</page><page sequence="16">48 RES 51 SPRING 2007 Figure 15. Ancestor or commemorative portrait of an old lady, late 1400-?arly 1500s. Formerly in Del Drago Collection, present location unknown. After Art News (November 1937), p. 126. These ?mages are all the more striking when compared to other portraits of the same period, such as imperial portraits dominated by pervasive stylization and symmetry. In these paintings?such as the portrait of Ming emperor Hongzhi?the face is reduced to a flat surface, an inexpressive mask, while the viewer is overwhelmed by the display of ceremonial paraphernalia (Fong 1996:332). This again raises a question of why at this particular time the face becomes so effective as likeness?how and why does the idea emerge that an ?mage of a face can represent a concrete person? And why do such specific individualizing treatments of the human face appear in the ancestral and commemorative portraits? In the often quoted passage from the Song dynasty Er Cheng Ji, the role of likeness is explicitly underscored: "If only one hair is not correctly rendered, the sacrifice will be for another man, which is most inconvenient" (Er Cheng Ji, SBBY ed. vol. 1, j.6.7b). It is questionable, however, whether such textual evidence can be taken to imply that realism and the utmost verisimilitude were indeed a critical precondition for the use of ancestral portraits, as had been suggested (Siggstedt 1991). Patricia Ebrey has recently pointed out the possible influence of Buddhist ideas of reincarnation and suggested that the widespread use of painted portraits of ancestors might follow the shift in attitude toward the dead, when the dead were treated less as gods and more as memories (Ebrey 2004). Ancestral and other commemorative portraits, including genealogical images, continued to be widely used during the Qing dynasty, but in most of them the role of the face as the primary signal of identity is dubious. Such portraits were required both to reenact the presence of a specific ancestor and to establish the social and ritual identity of the person, his or her status. Thus, in the case of vestments, the meticulous verism, evident in the painstaking depiction of details of decoration and the precise application of colors, transcribed garment as a sign of a person's status?this was as much, important to record, as the individual exigency of a face (fig. 16).43 Recently, Jan Stuart has convincingly argued for the importance of correct rendering of likeness in the ancestral portraits, conceived as heaven-endowed physiognomic features, some of which might indeed be described as "hypercritically veristic transcriptions of human faces" (Stuart 2005:222, 228). In many other paintings of this kind, however, the face is better described as a generalized model, supporting an obligatory conceptual scheme for the correct rendering of ancestral appearance. In typical examples of this genre, strictly iconic postures and forward gazes erase any signs of emotions or psychological states (Kesner 1993-1994; Stuart and Rawski 2001:51-58, 81-91 ; Stuart 2005:201, 222-223). Ancestral portraits, as Jan Stuart and Ewelyn Rawski note, were meant to present an otherworldy status?hence the immutable, eternal face in which the portraitist denies anything transitory (Stuart and Rawski 2001:52, 85). Therefore, even though transmitting the correct likeness may have been an important part of the task of the artist in creating ancestral portraits, it could have 43. On the role of likeness in establishing an identity in ancestral portraits, see Kesner 1993-1994. There I discuss several examples of negotiating the identity of persons depicted through the interplay of facial, bodily, perceptual, and conceptual aspects.</page><page sequence="17">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 49 been achieved through the manipulation of a limited set of variables. Not surprisingly, a good deal of evidence confirms that many, if not most, of these portraits were actually painted after the subjects' deaths, without the artist ever seeing the person, assembling their features from earlier sketchbooks, the so-called books of faces. A contemporary observer remarked on this practice: "Thus the death portrait became actually a mathematical problem. Nose 1, plus Mouth 6, plus Ear 22, plus Eyes 13, equals grandfather" (Bredon 1931:130). Such an approach to the representation of a face was further enhanced by the practice of physiognomy, which treated the human face as a cosmological map.44 We can see, therefore, a definite analogy, or continuity, with the "constructivist" approach to the creation of a face, which we have observed in Zhou jades and the Qin-Han tomb figures. The face again becomes a product of a modular system, assembled by manipulation of a stock of readymade pictorial/structural variables. Only this time, such a method often is used to produce a likeness of a specific individual. Conclusion It would be misleading to propose, on the basis of the preceding discussion, an existence of a specifically Chinese mode of the face as artifact: This approach to the representation of the human face is not exclusive to Chinese culture. One need only consider such images as the famous portraits of Giuseppe Arcimboldo, in which faces are elaborately put together with the aid of vegetables and fruits.45 Parallels to the practice of Chinese painters of ancestral portraits can be found in the medieval model-books (Scheller 1995) or in the craft of European itinerant folk portraitists, who would likewise create a composite portrait based on a set of predetermined units (Brentano 1958:165-167). Elsewhere, too, while people were certainly distinguished by their features, they may not have used such features to represent individuality (Strathem 1997:260). However, it is also true that such examples would constitute a minority within a representational regime, which?until well into modern revisions and under the influence of psychoanalysis and twentieth Figure 16. Ancestor portrait of an official, 1700s (Qing dynasty). Photo ? 2006 National Gallery, Prague. century theoretical concerns?took the face as a sign of personal identity and sought to develop representational means mostly to achieve the goal of capturing its particularity.46 The intimate link between the face and personal identity that Western art and observers have assumed for so long, and that only modern and post-modern artistic practice made problematic (but which we still take for granted), was not as firmly established in various forms of representation in China. The existence of recurrent conventions of representing faces as artifacts thus undermines the usual account of the rise of portraiture 44. See Siggstedt 1991 on the influence of the practice of physiognomy on portrait painting. 45. See, for example, Hulten 1987. One could argue, however, that even in this exceptional case, the artificially constructed faces? unlike many cases discussed here?were still intended to refer to particular personalities. 46. This is not to say that in Western art from the Renaissance until the nineteenth century the contextual determinants of human appearance could not occasionally outweigh the referential role of facial features. This point is well elaborated in Brilliant 1991.</page><page sequence="18">50 RES 51 SPRING 2007 in China as a linear, gradually unfolding process, a result of "humanization" on one hand and of the increasing mastery of artists over means of representations on the other: Dietrich Seckel, to give a recent example, has described the development of portraiture in China as "a long, consistent development from initial humanisation first to individualisation by means of certain physiognomic characteristics, then to personalisation as a preparatory step toward true portraiture where eventually persons receive their own faces, immediately to be recognized and identified" (Seckel 1993:9). Such a story seems no longer tenable. One could perhaps make a case for a very general trend of the increasing sensitivity toward human likeness and its recording in Chinese art, especially since the Late Ming period onward. But a convention of visualization of a face, in which its image is constructed by manipulation of a set of predetermined variables and in some instances totally separated from its role of a record of individual physiognomy (which dominated in early Chinese art) could have been in variously modified form reactivated in the later periods alongside increasing popularity of more individualized portraits exploiting personal idiosyncracies of likeness and expression.47 Before we ponder the significance of this recurrence of the mode of a face as an artifact further, a brief summary of the main characteristics of this idiom is neccessary. First, regarding the technology of their production, we have noted how these images were assembled from composite and prefabricated structural/ expressive/physiognomic variables in media and techniques varying from jade to ceramics to bronze casting to painting. Closely related to the mode of production are the morphological characteristics of images laid against the pictorial surface in which the values of symmetry, complementarity, and bilaterality? to be observed in biological faces?are further enhanced. This aspect relates faces made as artifacts to some other facial representations not discussed here so far, most notably renderings of the human face in the practices of physiognomic fate-reading or characterology (xiangfa or xiangshu). Xiangshu, based on a notion that the face is a frontal part of heart-mind (xin), aimed to infer an individual's moral character and destiny from the physiognomic configuration of a face, especially the relationship between its convex and concave parts. Physiognomies greatly developed during the Han dynasty, when it was designated as a recommended procedure for official appointments. Several scholars have noted that it influenced the approach to the human face on the part of portrait painters as well as the concept of likeness during the Ming period and perhaps even earlier (Siggstedt 1991 ; Vinograd 1992:5-6).48 It is difficult to assess the situation in early periods: Although some records trace it back to the Springs and Autumns periods of 722-481 b.c., no physiognomic manual survives from before the Late Tang dynasty.49 While it is thus impossible to prove such a claim, it is worth assuming that the long tradition of treating the face as an image field, subject to constructivist manipulation that we have observed in Bronze Age China, might in itself have informed the representation of the human face in physiognomic practice, which in turn further disseminated the morphological and conceptual idioms of frontal faciality in various contexts of Chinese visual culture. Finally, the stability and persistence of this idiom of frontal faciality can be considered in the light of what faces signal. Face (and human face specifically) conveys a range of biologically and socially important characteristics: generic identity, personal identity, sex, age, expression, lipspeech, gaze. In particular, the direction of the gaze and a facial expression are essential for the development of a theory of mind?a habit of a spontaneous attribution of mental states to others?which is crucial for the development of intersubjective relationships and which humans have developed to a very high degree (Cole 1998:73-85). Indeed, it may be as difficult for humans generally to resist the urge to read a face as a sign of emotion and intentions as it is for art historians to avoid routinely interpreting faces in portraits as guides into people's minds and souls.50 In light of this biologically ingrained 47. Many such portraits are the subject of a detailed treatment in Richard Vinograd's monograph on Ming and Qing informal portraiture (Vinograd 1992). 48. Siggstedt writes that ''The ardent striving for an illusionary rendering of the volumetric character of the individual physiognomy was caused by the concept of human face inherited from xiangshu, where the relationship between the protruding and receding planes was given the utmost importance" (1991:723-725, 740-741). 49. For early textual accounts of the practice of xiangshu, see Zhu 1989. Y? Ying-shi (1985:126) noted that the practice of xiangshu contributed significantly to the development of self-awareness and the concept of personal identity during the Early Six Dynasties period. 50. A crucial role of facial effects, such as the eye contact and expression, is highlighted in neurocognitive and neuropsychological accounts of a theory of mind (Baron-Cohen 1994). The current research in neurosciences on mirror neurons and biological roots of empathy and intersubjectivity provides a new perspective on the importance of facial expressions in human communication (see, for</page><page sequence="19">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 51 urge of humans to read faces of their conspecifios as signs of mental life and emotions, it is worth stressing the third salient feature of faces made as artifacts discussed here: a peculiar disjunction between identity and expression. Some of the images from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, as we have seen, do not project or portray any personal identity: They are separated from the indexical status of a record of unique individual physiognomy, a boundary demarcating the self. The thing-like face could exist primarily as an image, ontologically separated from the face as a sign of a concrete person. At the same time, their expressions cannot be read as displaying either emotions or states of mind. They have expressive qualities, but there is no discernible mind behind the expression. Instead, they only assert themselves by projecting cognitive uniformity or fulfilling other roles discussed above. It is as if the face refuses to communicate the usual signals.51 Later on, representations of faces as artifacts seem to oscillate between two poles: In some cases (mostly tomb figures and some religious sculpture and painting), they are capable of displaying a rich variety of sometimes nuanced emotional expressions, revealing the mind, but not a mind of an individual, specific, metaphysical being. In other cases (in ancestor portraits, much as in xiangshu diagrams), the situation is completely reversed, and physiognomic features convey personal likeness and hence identity, while any transitory states of the mind are obliterated. In these faces, one never encounters an expressive likeness, emotional expression being totally detached from any signal of personal identity.52 Such characteristics of the frontal face were well suited to demands and constraints of particular functions and uses in ritual and religious spaces, whether focused on the commemorative functions or strategies to create an afterworld as a make-believe version of this world or for other functions. In such contexts, personal identity could not have been simply detached from the social or ritual identity (as discussed with respect to the Qin terracotta army). There is some evidence to suggest that in the early forms of ancestor worship, when a person was being transformed into an ancestor he or she was becoming depersonalized, abstracted (Keightley 1978; Falkenhausen 1994). Many authors have stressed the intrinsically social and relational nature of the concept of self and personal identity in early Chinese culture, which?alongside increasingly elaborate and nuanced forms of experiencing and representing subjectivity and selfhood?continued to mold Chinese society. As Toni Barlow noted: "In Qing dynasty China, male and female, Confucian subjects always appeared as part of something else, defined not by essence but by context, marked by interdependence and reciprocal obligation rather than by autonomy and contradiction."53 An alternative conceptualization to the standard account of the development of portraiture as gradual elaborations of likeness tied to the increasing consciousness of the self and its representation can therefore be proposed. The frontal face in its many incarnations?ranging from true "faces of no one" wholly detached from the task of individualization, to those faces that oscillate along poles of identity/ expression?was one major morphological and conceptual convention throughout the history of Chinese art. It could be appropriated in the medium of painting and?responding to specific demands of a particular genre?serve as the basis of a vast array of painted effigies, of memorial and formal portraiture. Whenever specific demands of genre or occasion dictated, its implications could have been dissolved by inclusion?within the pictorial space?of contextual framing or relaxed in a way that permitted interplay of example, Wicker et al. 2003). Berger (1994:93) reflects on the habit of art historians to read minds from portraits: On this point, see also Z?llner 2005. 51. This quality can again be compared to physiognomic faces. Hajime Nakatani in his analysis of the semiotics of face-reading in Chinese culture notes that the outer configuration/surface does not mediate the inner (mind), rather it "extracts the meanings inherent in imagetext of the physiognomic face" (Nakatani 1996:6-10). 52. There is an interesting parallel between such dissociation and the means by which the brain represents different aspects of the face, as if faces fashioned as artifacts alternately engaged just one of many functional and neural pathways involved in face perception. According to the dominant view in contemporary neurobiology and cognitive science, face perception requires representation of invariant aspects and unchanging features that underlie identity recognition, as well as representation of changeable aspects, such as the eye, the gaze, and expression that facilitate social communication. Largely size-invariant, neural representation is involved in recognition of a facial identity, while a separate face-selective region in the superior temporal lobe is used to detect changeable aspects of faces (see, for example, Hoffman and Haxby 2000; Andrews and Ewbank 2004; Johnson 2005). For a comprehensive review of this "two-pathway" framework of face perception, see Calder and Young 2005. 53. Barlow 1989, as quoted in Yang 1994:44. See also Eno 1990. Mayfair Mei-hui Yang, discussing the art of social networking (guanxixue) in Chinese society in the 1980s, discussed at length the importance of the face for the Chinese relational construction of personhood. One may wonder to what extent the traditionally ingrained practice of elaborating and using the social face (mian), of enacting various social masks through which metaphysical identity of an individual human being is presented to the outside world, in itself could have diminished or pushed aside the signifying role of face as an emblem of the metaphysical self.</page><page sequence="20">52 RES 51 SPRING 2007 Figure 17.

Originally expressionless, the inanimate surface of a face as an artifact was well suited to permit a limited display of facial emotion?which, corresponding to Confucian norms of decorum, could be found in most portraits. It could even have been appropriated (the associations and effects of the face as an artifact being largely turned upside down) in some later portraits, where heightened consciousness and assertions of the individual self, or tension between public and private identity, or even the performance of the act of portraiture, received prominent emphasis. The presence of this idiom can be discerned even after more than a century of sustained influence of Western ideas and representational practices, when the Western conceptions of personal identity and the self permeated Chinese concepts of personality. One sees echoes of this approach to the human face in the recent work of several contemporary artists from mainland China who explore faciality?such as Fang Lijun, Liu Wei, or Zhang Xiaogang. Mesmerizing gazes of members of "revolutionary families" and "comrades" in Zhang's Bloodline series portraits is one of the most powerful meditations on the human face and personal</page><page sequence="21">Kesner: Face as artifact in early Chinese art 53 identity in contemporary art (fig. 17). They might be inspired by stylized conventions of Chinese studio portrait photography, but the strictly frontal views, devoid of facial expressions and strong emotions are reminiscent of the tradition of ancestral portraits and another reincarnation of the face as an artifact. The faces of Zhang's Comrades are homogenized into a depersonalized, inperturbable expression of a single mask, yet each of them is different. Stylistic analogy with commemorative portraits and the tragically resigned pathos of their expressions create a feeling that Zhang's comrades are to be perceived as postmortem portraits, faces from a gigantic commemorative album with which to remember those who were lost in the agonies of the Cultural Revolution or the entire Chinese modernity. With unusual force, Zhang Xiaogang poses questions about the boundary between a private "self" and its social role, about the fate of human uniqueness confronted by the homogenization imposed by modern society. These comrades present one of the most poignant expressions of faces in contemporary art, effective precisely because the reference to personal identity is nonexistent.
