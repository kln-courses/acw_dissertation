<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM SPIRITUAL DESCRIPTIONS TO LEGAL PRESCRIPTIONS: RELIGIOUS IMAGERY OF WOMAN AS "FETAL CONTAINER" IN THE LAW Lucinda J. Peach * INTRODUCTION In law, as elsewhere, the role of symbolism is of more than sym- bolic importance. Religious symbols of women help to reinforce pre- vailing gender ideologies about the proper place of men and women and women's appropriate roles and status in society. In American society, religious symbols of women and the feminine have functioned to shape legal views of women. These views essentialize women's role and status to that of reproductive vessels, or what I will here refer to as "fetal containers." This view of women as fetal containers has hin- dered the ability of women to secure either equal rights or equitable treatment under law. Despite the general secularization of the law over the last cen- tury, the religiously-grounded image of woman as fetal container has persisted in legal doctrine, especially in laws concerning employment discrimination, abortion, and, most recently, fetal protection policies and surrogate motherhood contracts. Because such imagery of wo- men has become a "naturalized" part of our secular cultural symbol- ism, its religious derivations are not always evident. Yet, law reform efforts need to address not only the more obvious forms of sex and gender discrimination, but also the pervasive influence of such reli- gious symbols and their influence on the status of women. The use of religious symbols to manipulate and control social reality is well documented.1 As the anthropologist Clifford Geertz has noted, religious symbols create "powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of * J.D., 1982, New York University School of Law, and Ph.D. candidate, Department of Religious Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 1.

"3 Religious symbols have been influential in shaping civil laws governing integral aspects of women's lives. The perpetuation of such symbolism in law is espe- cially pernicious because of the power such enactments have, not only in controlling the actual status and rights of women in society, but also in shaping social values and attitudes about women. In particular, Christian symbolic imagery of women has been a significant cause in generating and perpetuating various forms of dis- crimination against women.4 As Rosemary Ruether has observed, "[t]he male bias of Jewish and Christian theology not only affects the teaching about woman's person, nature, and role, but also generates a symbolic universe based on the patriarchal hierarchy of male over fe- male."5 For example, Margaret Miles describes how male-generated images of the feminine were used in medieval Christianity as a way to control women and express an ideal of the non-sexual woman.6 An important aspect of Christian religious symbolism has been the view of women as fetal containers or vessels for reproduction, ac- cording to which, the primary function of women is that of reproduc- tion and child care. This patriarchal view of women is exemplified in the two dominant symbols of the feminine in the Christian tradition: 2. Geertz, Interpretation at 90 (cited in note 1). He also contends that religious symbols are both models of divine reality and models for human behavior. Id. Caroline Walker Bynum suggests that religious symbols can also influence individual consciousness, citing re- cent feminist critiques that agree "that men gain authority from the fact that the source of ultimate value is often described in anthropomorphic images as Father or King."

Although these symbols may be viewed as polar opposites in several respects,7 they are both defined in terms of their relation to sexuality and maternity. The image of Eve, the original woman described in the Book of Genesis (2: 21-23) has predominantly been a negative one: she is cor- rupt, sinful, degraded, sexual, desirous, sensual, stupid, ignorant, greedy, etc. The Christian tradition extends Eve's "sin" of eating from the Tree of Knowledge to all women.8 The religious symbol of Eve has also played a social role since medieval times in explaining woman's pain in childbirth as punishment for the sins of her "Grand- mother Eve."9 This view rested upon the prophecy made in Genesis that "[u]nto the woman he [God] said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children" (Gen. 3: 16). In medieval Catholic belief, "after Eve's Fall, only the Virgin Mary, being born without original sin, did not suffer the pangs of childbirth, when she gave birth to the Infant Christ."'1 Yet women incapable of giving birth have been considered defec- tive because of their failure to fulfill the divine function they were created for. Fulfilling her "natural female role" by bearing children was considered a "woman's best chance to redeem herself from the sin of Eve and restore herself to honour."11 Without the ability to bear children, women were considered to be precluded from attaining grace. This philosophy was supported by the New Testament, for ex- ample, by the view that "Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing ...."12 This belief is also reflected in St. John 7. The Virgin Mary has been characterized as "the New Eve," a spiritual mother of humanity who removes the sins of the original woman.

Given this characteriza- tion, the anthropologists Edith and Victor Turner view Mary and Eve as structurally con- nected symbols, whose dichotomous relationship creates a "binary opposition," in which Mary represents the Church and Eve those who are outside the Church.

She is revered not only be- cause she is the mother of Jesus Christ, the son of God, but also be- cause of the non-sexual and divine nature of her conception of Jesus. This primary Christian role model for women "forgoes sexual plea- sure, physical prowess, and economic and intellectual power in order to become a "mother" for her 'divine' son."14 Thus, it is Mary's sta- tus as a virgin and mother of Jesus, not as an individual woman re- vered in her own right, which creates her sacred status. In fact, the medieval theologian St. Thomas Aquinas considered Mary's value and worth to be completely dependent upon her status as mother of Jesus. In his view, this achievement elevated the status of all women, and began the redemptive work necessary to remedy the sinfulness of humans attributed to Eve with the Fall.15 Thus, the two dominant symbols of the feminine in the Christian tradition have been maternal ones: women who are defined in relation to sexuality and childbearing. Mary, in particular, symbolizes woman as fetal container because her value and worth have been defined predomi- nantly in terms of her maternal role. In addition to this explicit feminine symbolism, the image of wo- men as fetal containers is also embedded in other Christian teaching of the early Church fathers. Paul's writings about women as inferior, weaker vessels whose sexual seductiveness needed to be controlled by men has influenced Church teaching for two thousand years.16 Au- gustine did not even grant women power over their own fertility and procreation, contending that "woman is the instrument of God's crea- 13.

He counseled men to "[c]ontrol your carnal appetite and look upon the hands of your creator, who is forming a human being in the mother's womb. He is at work, and you would desecrate the sanctuary of the womb with your lust."18 Saint Thomas Aquinas adopted Aristotle's view that man pro- vided the active power in procreation, with the woman intended merely "to help him in the work of procreation."19 Thus, he declared that "full power in marriage is given to the husband to use his wife for procreation."20 Here Aquinas follows Augustine, whose argument for the existence of sex in Paradise was based on women's inability to function as an intellectual help to men, thus leaving her, by default, with a "natural" reproductive role.21 According to Aquinas then, woman was merely a fetal container, because the very purpose of her being was as a passive and inert receptacle for generating life, the ac- tive force of which was totally provided by the man.22 The image of women as reproductive vessels has been enhanced by religious doctrines relating to sexuality and marriage, including the longstanding Catholic teaching that the only legitimate function of sex and marriage is for procreation.23 Several beliefs accompanied this view, including that sex during pregnancy or menstruation is sinful because no procreation is possible at those times. John Chrysostom echoes Augustine's and Aquinas' view of women's proper function in his diatribe to men against contraception, which he grounds in the circumstance that "[w]oman, made for reproduction, becomes, be- 17.

In 1984, for example, the Polish Catholic priest Henryk Jankow- ski, Lech Walesa's confessor, stated that the qualities he prized most in a woman were "piety and the willingness to have children."26 The literature of right to life groups associated with fundamentalist Prot- estant and Catholic groups reflects the "Augustinian image of woman as ordained by God to procreate; the passive receptacle of the male seed."27 The Christian pro-life view is one in which motherhood is "a state of being and not just a social role or relationship"; it is "the primary purpose of a woman's life."28 According to this view, abor- tion is "a sin against God in defiance of woman's nature, for which she is morally culpable."29 Procreation and childrearing are viewed as a woman's "privileged position and purpose in human history."30 Despite their being clothed in the language of contemporary science, Aquinas' views are still present in the modern preoccupation with the status and rights of the human fetus.31 Such religious images of woman objectify women's personhood, essentialize their nature, and instrumentalize their status and func- tions to that of mere reproductive vessels or fetal carriers. Although there is no necessary correlation between religious symbols of the fem- inine and the actual status of women in society, in this instance it is evident that such imagery has helped to perpetuate the oppression of women in society through its adoption by the law. It is well settled that religion has had a significant influence on the development of American law.32 Religious views of women and 24.

As historian James Brun- dage explains, "substantial parts of our medieval religious heritage remain embedded in Western law because they still reflect a broad consensus about the most desirable ways of shaping institutions and controlling human behavior."33 Despite the constitutional separation of church and state embodied in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, religious rationales were expressly used in early judicial decision-making to validate laws which discriminated against women.34 In upholding an Illinois statute barring women from the practice of law, for example, the United States Supreme Court in 1873 stated in Bradwell v Illinois that "[t]he constitution of the family organiza- tion, which is founded in the divine ordinance, as well as in the nature of things, indicates the. .. paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator."35 Courts have also applied explicitly religious rationales to uphold laws discriminating against women in other areas. For example, the legal doctrine of coverture, according to which all of a woman's prop- erty passed to her husband upon marriage, was based upon "the bibli- cal notions that 'husband and wife become one flesh' with the husband as 'head of the wife.' "36 And the judicial pronouncement that women could not sue their husbands was based upon the "re- vealed will of God" to be for the wife's protection.37 With the secularization of society, the stated rationale used to justify laws discriminating against women shifted from divine law to natural law. For example, in Matter of Goodell, the Wisconsin Supreme Court stated: "The law of nature destines and qualifies the female sex for the bearing and nurture of the children of our race ... And all life-long callings of women, inconsistent with these radical and sacred duties of their sex, as is the profession of law, are depar- 33.

Despite this general shift from religious to secular language, judi- cial decisions, as well as legislative enactments and other legal regula- tions, have continued to reflect the overall religiously-derived image of women as fetal containers.39 In addition, expressly religious ratio- nales have not entirely disappeared from judicial decisions. A Hawaii state court in the 1920s explained the difference between the sexes as divinely ordained, "as we are told in Holy Writ, when God created man, 'male and female created he them'."40 And an Oregon state court as recently as 1970 stated that "[t]he Creator took care of classi- fying men and women differently".41 Women are viewed as fetal con- tainers in a variety of areas of law, including employment discrimination, abortion, fetal protection policies, and surrogacy con- tracts. Reproductive capacity thus continues to serve as the basis for denying equal protection to women and enforcing their inferior legal status. The "naturalized" religious imagery of woman as fetal container first appeared in judicial decision-making enacted in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which upheld the constitutionality of protective labor legislation concerning women.42 Such legislation "protected" women by restricting the terms and conditions of their employment to a "different" (usually inferior) basis than that of men. In 1908, the Supreme Court in Muller v Oregon upheld an Oregon statute limiting to ten the maximum number of hours a day that a woman could work in any factory, laundry or mechanical establish- ment, because "healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring [and] the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race."43 The Court failed to consider women's interests, desires, or economic need to work. Rather, protective legislation of this sort was 38. 39 Wis 232, 245 (1875). 39.

It neglected wo- men's abilities to make rational, independent choices about employment.45 An example of this attitude is reflected in the brief submitted by Louis Brandeis in People v Charles Schweinler Press, in which Brandeis stated that the domestic and child care difficulties as- sociated with women's night work, when weighed against society's interest in women's reproductive and family responsibilities, should always be resolved in favor of protecting the latter.46 The implicit message of such legislation was that women should be at home having and raising babies, not out in the workplace earning wages. Even after Congress passed Title VII to the 1964 Civil Rights Act in 1971, which prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sex,47 employers continued to discriminate against women by terminating or restricting their employment as a result of pregnancy. Such employment decisions were often upheld by courts, especially in cases involving airline stewardesses.48 The Supreme Court usually validated such discriminatory policies by declaring that discriminat- ing against pregnant women was not sex discrimination under the terms of Title VII because the policies did not discriminate between women and men, but rather, between pregnant and non-pregnant per- sons!49 Because these decisions totally ignored the reality that only 44.

The message implied by these cases is that women who are pregnant are fetal containers who do not be- long in the workplace. Congress eventually attempted to reverse the Court's interpreta- tion of pregnancy under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by redefining sex discrimination in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, by amending the definition of "sex discrimi- nation" in Title VII to include pregnancy, and finally by enacting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) in 1978.50 The PDA explicitly puts discrimination on the basis of pregnancy within the scope of Title VII's prohibitions.51 The Supreme Court recognized Congress' intent that regulations concerning pregnancy be treated as part of sex dis- crimination analysis under Title VII.52 Although the PDA significantly improved the status of women by insisting that employers treat pregnancy as any other temporary disability, it has only eliminated the legal significance of women's bio- logical difference for employment purposes. The legislation reflects a shift in perception from considering women's status as that of perpet- ual fetal containers to being only intermittent ones. But as Zillah Eisenstein points out, its requirement that pregnancy be treated the same as any temporary disability does not adequately account for the reality that pregnancy is not just temporary, because it marks the be- need not compensate pregnancy-related disabilities like other disabilities under Title VII, be- cause discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not sex-based).

In this case, the Court invalidated the consti- tutionality of mandatory pregnancy leave policies adopted by public schools on due process grounds, finding that the schools' administrative convenience was inadequate grounds for ter- minating women's employment during pregnancy, and that the choice of how long to work during pregnancy is an individual decision that requires constitutional protection. 50.

Fetal protection is a rapidly growing area of legal and ethical concern.

See Sylvia A. Law, Rethinking Sex and the Constitution, 132 U Pa L Rev 955 (1984). Given the main contention in this paper that viewing women in terms of their biological differ- ence, i.e., as fetal containers, has been a significant factor in the oppression of women, I disa- gree with Law's thesis that the problem lies with inadequate attention to women's biological difference in the development of modem constitutional sexual equality doctrine. 55. In what can be construed as another employment case involving the view of women as fetal containers, the Supreme Court invalidated two school board policies requiring mandatory unpaid pregnancy leave of pregnant school teachers in Cleveland Bd of Educ v LaFleur, 414 US 632 (1974). The school boards sought to justify their policies on pregnancy by claiming that they were intended "to protect the health of the teacher and her unborn child." Id at 641. A more cynical interpretation of the policies is that they were intended to keep pregnancy out of public view, because women as fetal containers should be at home, not in the classroom where their biological function would be obvious to the children. The school boards' policies recall the paternalistic justifications given in defense of protective labor legislation a century before, which reflected similar attitudes towards women as reproducers first, and producers second. 56. Compare, for example, Michael Harrison et al, Occasional Notes: Fetal Treatment 1982, 307 New England J Medicine 1651 (1982), stating in 1982 that although many fetal abnormalities could be detected, only a few were amenable to treatment, and those that were, including for congenital diaphramatic hernia, were still experimental, with Gina Kolata, A Major Operation on a Fetus Works for the First Time, New York Times Al (May 31, 1990), reporting on the successful treatment of a fetus in the womb for congenital diaphramatic her- nia.

Cases relating to these policies may be grouped roughly in three dif- ferent categories: fetal protection policies enacted by employers which restrict women's employment opportunities; laws which authorize state intervention into the mother's physical autonomy on behalf of the fetus; and policies which impose punitive measures on mothers who give birth to children alleged not to have been properly cared for in the womb. Decisions in all three of these categories reflect the re- ligiously-based image of woman as fetal container. A significant number of judicial decisions within the first cate- gory have dealt with employer policies which restrict women from certain types of employment on the grounds of protecting actual or potential fetuses from harm. There are striking parallels between the earlier protective labor legislation and the more recent fetal protection policies.58 These include identifying women with their reproductive functions, refusing to consider how these policies affect women, and assuming that women are not competent to make their own deci- sions.59 Several federal courts have upheld such "fetal protection pol- icies," despite the obviousness of their discriminatory impact. These discriminatory policies generally ignore evidence that male exposure to toxins in the workplace may also adversely affect fetal development and they are seldomly imposed in industries which predominantly employ females.60 Fetal protection policies such as that at issue in the recent Supreme Court decision in International Union, UAW v Johnson Con- trols, Inc.,61 which excluded all women from certain occupations un- less they could provide documentary evidence of their infertility, 57. See, for example Gallagher, Position Paper 188 (cited in note 31): "Of all the argu- ments for fetal rights, the most popular and seemingly secular have been those based on our increased knowledge about prenatal development and new medical advances permitting in utero diagnosis and treatments." Commentators have contended that "[F]etal rights cases represent a renewed attempt to define and control a woman's life by her reproductive capacity, as well as an attempt to imprison her throughout her pregnancy."

Fetal protection policies which consider women only in these terms treat them not as individuals or responsible moral agents, but as "the physical vessels for genetic messages."63 Such policies also as- sume that women's economic roles are less important than their re- productive ones.64 In general, such policies take no account of women's constitu- tionally protected rights to autonomy and privacy in making repro- ductive decisions.65 They bypass the woman's autonomy in favor of protecting a fetus which may never viably exist. Such policies also ignore the rights of women to determine for themselves whether to risk the hazards of the workplace in view of the particular conditions of their own lives.66 They thus reflect the paternalistic assumption that women will not make decisions that are in the best interests of their potential future children.67 Mary Becker has noted, for exam- ple, that employers have "asserted as uncontroversial that the inter- ests of the potential fetus rank 'above those of the mother/worker, and that limited employment opportunity for women is a small price for mothers, potential mothers, and society to pay.'

The constitu- tional right to privacy was first recognized by the Supreme Court in Griswold v Connecticut, 381 US 479 (1965), a case holding that Connecticut could not prohibit married persons from access to contraception. Griswold recognized that persons have a "natural right" to privacy and autonomy against state interference in a number of areas relating to procreation and fam- ily matters. This right was further clarified in Eisenstadt v Baird, 405 US 438 (1972). In invalidating a Massachusetts statute prohibiting the sale or distribution of contraceptives to single persons, the Court stated: "If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child." Id at 453. Roe v Wade, 410 US 113 (1973), extended this right to women in making abortion deci- sions. And in Whalen v Roe, 429 US 589, 600 n 26 (1977), the Court noted that the constitu- tional right of privacy extended to limit state interference with personal decisions associated with "matters relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education." 66.

Decisions about the welfare of future children must be left to the parents who conceive, bear, support, and raise them rather than to the employers who hire those parents."72 The Court concluded that "[i]t is no more appropriate for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more im- portant to herself and her family than her economic role. Congress has left this choice to the woman as hers to make."73 Nonetheless, the ethical implications underlying such fetal protection statutes on the status of women have not been resolved by the Johnson Controls case, because the Johnson company's regulations on fetal protection were extreme. It is unclear whether a more carefully tailored fetal protec- tion policy, which only applied to women intending to become preg- nant, for example, would pass constitutional muster. Another type of fetal protection policy covers a variety of medi- cal situations in which physicians believe that the health and future viability of a fetus requires some type of surgery or physical interven- tion affecting the pregnant woman. These situations range from pre- natal testing to major surgery. Litigated cases have involved blood transfusions, Cesarean sections, and, most recently, surgery on the fe- tus.74 The most controversial cases involve efforts by physicians to 69.

"BFOQ" (which stands for "bona fide occupational qualification") is an exemption to Title VII's prohibition on employer discrimination in cases where the regulations discriminate "on their face."

Perhaps the most disturbing case to date is In re A. C., 533 A2d 611 (DC 1987), in which the court issued an order, over the husband's objections, authorizing a Cesarean section to be performed on a pregnant woman about to die of cancer in order to attempt to salvage her four month old fetus. Neither fetus nor mother survived more than two days after the surgery. The case was subsequently vacated because of constitutional concerns by 573 A2d 1235 (DC 1990).

Physicians have succeeded in obtaining court orders in most cases in which they have requested them.75 The fetal container image of women is evident in cases like these in which pregnant women are forced to undergo unwanted surgery on behalf of their fetuses, operations which physicians agree increase the risk of the woman's death. These cases sharply diverge from the gen- eral legal doctrine that individuals are not required to undergo any risk of physical harm to help another. Although some commentators have recognized that such inter- vention violates the woman's rights to parental autonomy and bodily integrity,76 others have proposed judicial standards for courts to apply in determining whether such interventions are justified or not.77 Those who advocate judicial authorization of fetal therapy opposed by the pregnant women involved have taken inadequate account of women's constitutionally protected privacy rights to autonomy and independence in matters of procreation and childbearing. These rights extend to parental autonomy to make medical decisions on be- half of their children,78 and can only be infringed by state legislation (1981), a physician informed his patient that because of a complication in her pregnancy, there was a 99 percent chance that she would lose the fetus and a 50 percent chance that she would die unless she agreed to deliver by Cesarean section. The physician was granted a court order authorizing him to perform the surgery over the mother's religiously based objection. (As it turned out, the woman delivered a healthy infant vaginally.) Other courts have authorized surgery in similar circumstances. See discussions in George J.

For example, Hallissy has proposed that judicial authorization of medical interven- tions on behalf of the fetus should not be made over the woman's objections in two situations. First, "a mother should be allowed ... to refuse fetal therapy when it is offered not as a cure, but solely to prolong or salvage the life of a seriously impaired fetus." Second, she should be able to refuse therapy when the efficacy of the treatment is disputed or presents a significant risk to the mother's life. Hallissy, 14 Pac L J at 1069 (cited in note 56). She suggests that the state's interest in protecting the life and health of the unborn, and "in promoting responsible private medical care decisions affecting the fetus" otherwise justifies medical intervention on behalf of the fetus against the mother's wishes.

They thus ignore the constitutional right of persons to be free of unwarranted bodily intru- sions,81 which includes the right to refuse judicially ordered surgery.82 The possibilities for medical intervention are limitless, because the woman's health care, diet, etc., even prior to conception, may affect the health of the fetus.83 A third category of fetal protection cases involve restrictions on women's conduct while pregnant, and prosecutions of women whose children are born damaged because they received inadequate prenatal care, for example, because of the mother's drug and alcohol abuse during pregnancy. These cases present some of the most difficult deci- sions as well as some of the most disturbing negative implications of the view that women are fetal containers. Indeed, medical personnel frequently refer to pregnant women as fetal "containers" or "incuba- tors."84 In a controversial case, People v Stewart,85 a woman was prosecuted after her baby was stillborn, for failure to obey her physi- cian's advice late in her pregnancy not to work, take drugs or have sexual intercourse, and to call the doctor if she began to hemorrhage. In another recent case, a mother was convicted and jailed for transfer- the education of their children); Pierce v Society of Sisters, 268 US 510 (1925) (right to send children to parochial rather than public school). 79. By conflating the state's right to intervene to order medical treatment for children over parental objection with such intervention on behalf of the fetus, Hallisey's proposal, for example, ignores the constitutionally based legal distinction between children, who are "per- sons," and fetuses, which are not.

Once a case of fetal abuse is identified, the woman would be required to submit to periodic urinalysis to monitor evidence of continuing substance abuse.88 Other commentators have also proposed that prosecutions of preg- nant women for providing inadequate prenatal care to their fetuses are legitimate in certain circumstances.89 Such proposals represent the very sort of "system of surveillance and coercion oppressive to all women of childbearing age" that Janet Gallagher fears may result from the "fetal rights" movement.90 Some courts and commentators have recognized that child abuse and neglect statutes should not be applied on behalf of a fetus, because they were not drafted with the unborn in mind, and because a fetus does not have the legal status of a person.91 Others have raised equal protection concerns based on the recognition that punishment on the basis of pregnancy affects only women,92 as well as infringes upon the 86.

Ar- guably, proscription of the injurious conduct is no more intrusive on autonomy rights than are compelled cesarian sections or fetal therapy.

To ground deci- sions elsewhere-with doctors or lawyers or judges-is to treat pregnant women as seed gardens or vessels, to deny them the bod- ily integrity and self-determination specific to human dignity.94 Currently, most state laws provide only rough analogies to justify the kind of prosecutions that Balisy recommends. Prosecutors have had to rely on laws which prohibit child abuse and neglect, but are not directly applicable because they specifically refer to children, not fetuses, and the Supreme Court has declared that a fetus is not a legal person.95 However, the prospects of further judicial decisions or legis- lation authorizing such prosecutions, in conjunction with advances in fetal-monitoring technology, present the very real threat that women will be viewed as fetal containers to an even greater extent in the fu- ture than they have been in the past. Of all the laws affecting the status of women, abortion laws most clearly and starkly reflect the view of women as fetal containers. Although such laws were only developed beginning in the mid-nine- teenth century, all states now have some provisions relating to abor- tion.96 Gallagher contends that both the fetal rights and anti- abortion movements "represent attempts to reimpose a deeply held view of the natural, God-given role of woman as self-sacrificing mother."97 Laws that would outlaw abortion reflect values and atti- tudes that women's appropriate function is to bear children, regard- less of her desires, life circumstances, capability for or willingness to take on the burdens of pregnancy and childbearing.98 In an earlier era, limiting women's access to contraception was rationalized on the ground that women "would indulge themselves by refusing, for frivo- parent.

Anti-abortion advocates involved in the Roe v Wade decision ex- emplified this attitude when they argued that the state's interest in protecting pre-natal life is more important than any interests the preg- nant woman might have, except when her life was in danger.?? Even though the Supreme Court held in Roe v Wade that women have a constitutionally protected privacy right to a legal abortion dur- ing the first trimester of their pregnancy,'10 abortion laws and pro- posed legislation continue to reflect a view of women as fetal containers. Even the Court in Roe refused to extend the constitu- tional right of privacy to encompass an unlimited protection of per- sonal physical autonomy. Rather, it determined that the state does have a "compelling interest" in protecting fetal life after viability and can proscribe abortions after that point.'02 Ever since Roe, many legislators and politicians have attempted to restrict or even remove this constitutionally protected right to abortion. By 1979, federal legislation restricted public funding for abortions to situations where the mother's life was in danger.103 In the meanwhile, states have continued to pass exceedingly restrictive statutes specifying the terms and conditions under which women can obtain abortions. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional- ity of many of these restrictive abortion statutes, most recently in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.104 This move to restrict the scope of the Roe v Wade decision reflects a con- 99. Id at 59. 100. Roe, 410 US at 150. 101. Id at 154. 102. Id at 163-64. 103.

In Webster v Reproductive Health Serv., 492 US 490 (1989), the Court upheld provisions of a Missouri stat- ute banning the use of public employees and facilities for abortions, and requiring physicians to test fetuses at least 20 weeks old for viability.

The issue of surrogate motherhood is another area in which the fetal container imagery is overwhelmingly present. Because this area of reproductive technology is so new, courts and state legislatures have only recently begun to create public law regulating the practice. Legal regulation has largely been in response to the famous Baby M case, which ultimately awarded custody to the biological father, de- spite the surrogate mother's petition to keep the infant that she had contracted to give birth to for others. Sorting out how women are treated as fetal containers is complicated in this area of law, however, in part because the practice of surrogacy itself, aside from legal inter- pretation of that practice, treats women as fetal containers. This treatment is evinced by references to surrogacy as "womb" or "uterus-rental" and to surrogate mothers as "breeders" and "baby machines."105 Arguments on both sides of the debate about whether surrogacy should be allowed, and, if so, under what conditions, charge their opponents with treating women as merely fetal containers. 106 The view of woman as fetal container has been relied upon to justify a number of other judicial decisions involving women as well. For example, laws prohibiting fornication and adultery were once en- forced by strict sanctions thought "necessary if women were to be kept psychologically and economically dependent, with reproduction and mothering as their primary roles."107 The objectification of wo- men as reproductive vessels is also present in cases concerning voting and jury service.108 All these cases are influenced by a religiously- 105.

For example, in upholding the validity of a statute excluding women from mandatory jury duty, the Mississippi Supreme Court in 92 [Vol. 10</page><page sequence="21">RELIGIOUS IMAGERY OF WOMAN based view of women as fetal containers that has been adopted by lawmakers. CONCLUSION Most legal scholarship has ignored the pervasive influence which religious imagery and its secularized forms has had on the develop- ment of the law. Specifically, it has failed to recognize the way legal doctrines have been, and continue to be, shaped by religiously- grounded images representing the proper role and status of women as fetal containers. The religious roots of such imagery may not be obvi- ous because they have blended into religion's secular surroundings in the twentieth century. Nonetheless, such imagery serves to perpetu- ate the subordinate and inferior status of women in society, especially in the areas of employment, abortion, fetal protection, and surrogacy laws. Law plays a symbolic function as well as a regulatory one.109 Thus, the way that the law portrays or depicts women will have an influence in shaping social values and attitudes, even apart from its direct impact on the treatment of women. An adequate legal theory must be equipped to deal with this symbolic function of law, as well as its material effects on the status of women's lives. In order to address inequality adequately, it is necessary to pay attention to the power of such symbols, as Joan Scott suggests, "that is, to the ways societies represent gender, use it to articulate the rules of social relationships, or construct the meaning of experience."110 If women's oppression is to be overturned, it will require eliminating the legal use of such relig- iously-grounded stereotypes as that of women as fetal containers. State v Hall, 187 S2d 861, 863 (Miss 1966), held that the legislature was justified in enacting the exclusion of women "so they may continue their service as mothers, wives, and homemak- ers, and also to protect them . . . from the filth, obscenity, and noxious atmosphere that so often pervades a courtroom during a jury trial." See also Hoyt v Florida, 368 US 57, 62 (1961), (excusing women from jury service unless they voluntarily registered, because "woman is still regarded as the center of home and family life"). 109. Zillah Eisenstein probably comes the closest of any of the prominent feminist legal scholars to recognizing this symbolic power of law. She characterizes law as "an authorized discourse," that is, "a language constituted by a series of symbols that is located in not merely the realm of the 'ideal' or the 'real' but a place somewhere in between."
