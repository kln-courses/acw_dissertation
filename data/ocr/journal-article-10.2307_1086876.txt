<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 29 GREEK PIETY. By MARTIN PERSSON NILSSON, translated by Herbert Jennings Rose. Oxford University Press, 1948. Pp. 200. ($3.25) ANY work by Professor Nilsson on Greek religion is of considerable interest, and not least this attempt to present in popular form the conclusions of a lifelong study of the subject. The author's aim is to convey to his readers the popular attitudes towards the gods from Homer to the end of paganism. Two chapters, the Archaic Period and the Dissolution, deal with the pre-classical, classical, and early Hellenistic periods; a third, Rebuilding, with later Hellenistic and Roman times. This last chapter takes up more than half the book, and it is especially useful in that it contains a short and clear account of the various aspects of the religious movements of the period, which is not easily available elsewhere to the general reader in a digestible form. The book as a whole is brilliantly translated by Professor Rose and very readable indeed. In trying to convey popular attitudes Nilsson deliberately keeps poets and philosophers in the background; "poets were makers of poetry, not religious reformers; what a Pindar or Aeschylus says of the gods and divine governance left hardly a trace in the religion of their own or later times . . . philosophy did nothing to construct belief until the Hellenistic age." But Nilsson himself cannot live up to this surprising negation and we find him saying barely a page later that Homer "created the forms in which the gods lived in the consciousness of the Greek people . . .," with the exception of Demeter and Dionysus. A similar influence must obviously be granted to the Hesiodic Theogony. And even the fifth century poets were so very close to, and so very much a part of, the religious as well as the aesthetic and even political life of the people, at least in the cities, that one cannot thus deny them any influence upon the gods. A later statement of the author's is probably relevant here, and somewhat startling, namely: "anthropomorphism ... made the gods too humanly beautiful, too aesthetically satisfactory to be real Powers.. ." (my italics). Surely that aesthetic appeal was, on the contrary, a potent factor in their survival as gods from Homer to Julian. Nilsson, however, with his eye on disintegration from the fifth century if not before, seems to deny any effective survival. That atheism, scepticism, and rationalism were common in the fifth century is, of course, true, and is here well brought out; but there is a tendency to overemphasize the negative aspect of the great writers' attitude to the gods. If, for example, "no one with an atom of belief treats the gods as Aristophanes does" (p. 77), then Aristophanes was an uncons- cionable hypocrite. Yet the comic poet was in the Homeric tradition when laughing at his gods, and the logical concluision of this approach</page><page sequence="2">30 THE PHOENIX is that there never was a time when the Greeks believed in their gods. Clearly, there is something wrong with that conclusion. There is some danger too in leaving out the philosophers. Not only do we miss any adequate account of the Stoic religion (for it was largely that in Roman times) or of that of Plotinus, but even in classical times in Greece the influence of the philosophers cannot be ignored, and those who trace the development of religious concepts pari passu in religion, poetry, philosophy, and politics (as Werner Jaeger tries to do in his Paideia and also in his Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers) seem to attain a truer perspective. Nor is it true to say of the fifth century Greeks that "the idea never occurred to them that a whole people may become guilty of such pride and be visited by such nemesis." That idea occurred not only to Plato, it dominates the history of Thucydides, and indeed it is found in Hesiod. Nevertheless, though Nilsson fails to solve the enigma of the real religious significance of the Olympian gods for more than a millennium, which is in part at least due to his desire to ignore poets and philosophers, he does, in a clear, concise, and illuminating manner, provide the reader with a very great deal of the necessary information which anyone must possess before he comes to grips with the question of meaning. The curiously legalistic and patriotic nature of the Olympian worship, the Apolline law of reason, moderation, and self-knowledge, the tragic formula of hubris and nemesis, the doubts and criticisms of the fifth and fourth centuries, the divers and confused religions of the Roman empire-all these are vividly brought before us; and the above criticism applies less to the later period which was indeed the period of disinte- gration. The discussion of the struggle between paganism and Christianity is particularly good as an introduction to the subject: "it was a conversion from rationalism to mysticism, from the clear, logical lines of Greek thought to faith in the wonderful, supernatural and supersensuous, from the love of the beauty of the world and the body to flight from the world and condemnation of all that was corporeal, from sensual desire to asceticism." Altogether, this is a book well worth study, and it should provoke to further study. G. M. A. GRUBE</page></plain_text>
