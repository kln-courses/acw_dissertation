<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES PERFECT AND PARTICIPLE IN DESCRIPTIONS OF RITUAL IN THE MISHNAH by Yochanan Breuer In Mishnaic descriptions of ritual two tenses are used as one: the perfect and the participle. As a number of scholars have pointed out, these tenses are interchangeable, with no apparent conditions. The question arises: is this a special style, used to describe ritual, where both tenses are arbitrarily interchangeable, or can one find a certain consistency and set of conditions for the use of each of these tenses? As a first step in dealing with this question, we propose to divide all Mishnaic descriptions of ritual into two groups: rituals in which the main tense is the perfect, and rituals in which the participle is primarily used. The discussion deals with each group separately and sets up certain principles, some dealing with content and some linguistic, which govern the transition from one tense to another, e.g. to explain the deviations from the main tense in each group. After explaining the deviations in each group from the main tense, we find that there are two groups of descriptions of ritual in the Mishnah. There is no arbitrary transition from tense to tense, since the inner deviations in each group are ordered and guided by cerain clear principles. Now the question arises: why are certain rituals described in one tense, while other rituals in the other? Is there some principle behind the choice of the tense which describes the entire ritual? Such a principle is not found. The key to solving this problem is apparently found in the fact that the Mishnah does not have one author, and Yehuda Hanassi edited the Mishnah from various sources he had before him. Therefore, it seems that the difference in tenses in the descriptions of ritual derives from the fact that they were written by different authors, and perhaps even at different periods. Here certain hypotheses can be made and two suggestions are presented in this article. AMRAM BAR SHESHNA- GAON OF SURA? by Robert Brody The Epistle of Sherira Gaon, our main source (inter alia) for the chronology of the Gaonic period, contains a glaring contradiction with regard to the Sura academy in the 9th century C.E.: a period of 128 years is made to contain a series of shorter periods which total 142 years (if not more). Due to the paucity of chronological information for this period in other sources, previous attempts to correct Sherira's account have had to resort in large measure to arbitrary emendation. The author brings to</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES bear on this question a new technique establishing chronological correlations between the Gaonim of Sura and those of Pumbeditha, whose dates are well established. This is accomplished primarily by noticing pairs of Gaonim to whom identical inquiries were addressed, and who may therefore be assumed to have been contemporaneous. Such correlations, combined with previously known data, lead to the suggestion that Amram b. Sheshna, of whom Sherira reports that he founded a dissident academy in competition with the traditional academy of Sura, in fact never returned to the mother institution (pace Sherira). Several problematic sources which may provide support for such a contention are discussed, and the historical background is conjecturally reconstructed. The author suggest that the vice-Gaon of Amram's academy was Zemah b. Hayyim, rather than Zemah b. Solomon, as assumed by previous writers, and that it was he who returned to the central academy of Sura, to rule as Gaon following the demise of Natronai b. Hilai. THE DOWERING OF BRIDES IN THE GHETTO OF VENICE: BETWEEN TRADITION AND CHANGE, IDEALS AND REALITY by Elliott Horowitz Among the Jews of Europe in the later Middle Ages the payment of a substantial cash dowry to the groom became the dominant means of effecting a marriage. As a consequence, the provision of financial aid to needy brides came to be recognized in such authoritative sources as the Shulkhan Arukh as the highest form of charity. The consciousness of the widespread need for such aid, which extended to families not normally dependent upon charity, led eventually to the foundation of pious confraternities devoted to the dowering of brides. Although the first of these was thought to have been founded by members of the Ponentine community of Venice in 1613, a newly discovered minute book reveals that an Italian-Ashkenazic confraternity called HasiBetulot had been founded there as early as 1576. The article assesses the possible impact of the Venetian Catholic environment, in which the dowering of brides was a favorite form of charity, upon the emergence of the confraternity and chronicles the considerable changes which occurred in its policies between 1576-1640. Whereas its original intention was to aid the 'shamefaced poor' for whom the provision of a respectable dowry was especially difficult, it turned increasingly inward, limiting its aid first to the members of its own community and then, de facto, to the daughters and relatives of its members. New light is also shed on the biography of R. Leone Modena, who served for a time as scribe of the confraternity and who cleverly utilized his ties with it in order to gain preferential treatment for his daughter Esther — a matter he conveniently neglected to mention in his account of her marriage in Hayyei Yehudah.</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES III THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE COMMANDMENTS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF RABBI NACHMAN OF KROCHMAL by Benjamin Ish-Shalom In contrast to the conception of language prevalent in the Middle Ages (based on Platonic thought), in which language was considered as essentially descriptive, and in contrast as well to the rationalistic attitude which conceived of language as the representation of rational, objective ideas, a new approach began to develop in the period of the Sturm und Drang, according to which language, its essence and its genesis, comes to play a primary and vital role in human existence. This approach in German Romantic language philosophy permitted Rabbi Nachman of Krochmal to develop a new theory of religion as language, while allowing him to preserve the intellectual nature of Judaism on the one hand, and to assert the centrality of the commandments as actions of cognitive significance on the other. In the opinion of R. Krochmal the contents of religious ideas are identical to the contents of rational thought but for the fact that their linguistic form is not adequately suited to the concepts it symbolizes, nor is it significant to 'total perception'. This language, in his view, is analogous to and accessory of thought processes. One layer of religious language is also fixed in the nature of thought. Religious language, however, has the additional acquired layer, which does not originate in the nature of language but rather in the Torah; its role is nevertheless the same as that of natural language. Language is defined by R. Krochmal as playing two roles: the one, intrapersonal, that is in the service of human thought, and the interpersonal, to make communication possible among people. Language is not merely the instrument of thought but also exerts over it a formative force. The communicative role palyed by language in the intrapersonal realm is widely recognized. By the process of rational thought, which is in fact reflexive thought occurring by means of language, man becomes aware of his own inner self. In R. Krochmal's view, language is a significant human ability in that it is spiritual, just as thought is significant for him. Moreover, the formative power of language resembles that of the thought process itself; and the spiritual in itself is identical to its manifestation in thinking and its revelation to another personality by means of language. Language is made of many layers, from the allusions made by its components, to symbolic actions, to language of concepts. Language for R. Krochmal is not conventional and neither does it develop from a sensual to a rational stage; rather it is composed of various simultaneously existing levels, all of them significant in the thought process. The rational stage is not more valuable than the sensual stage; instead, all stages are seen as simultaneously necessary. R. Krochmal's conception of language, akin in particular to the theory of Wilhelm von Humboldt, holds that religious practice is an aspect of language essential to religious thought and is not to be seen as a primitive stage in the developmental process of human consciousness.</page><page sequence="4">IV SUMMARIES A STUDY OF THE GET IN THE UNITED STATES: A COMPARISON BETWEEN EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN REFORM by Shlomit Yahalom In June 1869 prominent local Reform rabbis assembled in Philadelphia and agreed upon a series of decisions, among them the abrogation of the get, the Jewish writ of divorce. Henceforth, only civil divorce would be necessary. This important decision was based on European Reform ideology, but the European Reform assemblies did not ratify this decision nor even discuss it. What brought the Reform rabbis in America to take this step, and can this decision testify to a general aim, a desire to free themselves of the burden of tradition? In order to answer these questions, I first describe in this article the ratification process of the Philadelphia assembly. Then I delineate the European ideological sources of the decision. I have examined the extent of dependence of American Reform upon European authority, both Orthodox and Reform. I have then attempted to understand the decision against the background of civil law in Germany and the United States, gathering material concerning the various aspects of the new and varied Jewish reality which was created, in order to better understand the decision to abolish theger. The conclusion of this study is that the complex new reality had more of a hand in the abrogation of the get than Reform ideology, or the desire to escape the authority of the Jewish establishment in Europe, although all these coalesced to allow for this daring step away from Jewish rabbinic tradition. The decision to abolish the get was accompanied by a sense of hopelessness. There seemed no other escape from the difficult moral, religious and legal situation which had developed in the area of divorce. German Reform did not accept a similar decision because it arrived at different theological conclusions, because the civil law in Germany until its unification left no room for such a decision, and because the problem of divorce was not as acute as it was for American Jewry. The decision to abrogate the get, therefore, does not teach us anything about the general aims of American Reform. On several other issues, American Reform did not go as far as German Reform. Before the large-scale emigration from Eastern Europe, when American Reform dominated most communities and was at the pinnacle of its power, it did not abuse its strong position, nor did it get drunk on the special sort of freedom offered by this land and wander far from the German Reform model, as is sometimes believed, and as might have been expected. YEHUDA HALEVI'S WEDDING POEM by Yehuda Ratzhabi The poem 'כפלח הרמון אדמה רקתך' is a well-known wedding poem, published about fifteen times in the poetry collections of the eastern communities, and even in the Karaite siddur. This poem has previously been attributed to Moses the Scribe, son of Benjamin of Rome (12th century) and even to Elijah Ha-Cohen Zalabi of Anatolia. The author in his list proves that these are false ascriptions. Basing himself on two early manuscripts of mahzorim which include fragments of poems by Yehuda Halevi, including this poem, as well as a genizah fragment of the poem, he reaches the conclusion that the poem's author is Yehuda Halevi. The quality of the poem and its style are further evidence of its authorship by Yehuda Halevi.</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES BOOK REVIEW: PETER SCHÄFER, GENIZA-FRAGMENTE ZUR HEKHALOT LITERATUR, TÜBINGEN 1984 by Joseph Dan One of the most important sources for the Hekhalot and Merkabah mystical literature is the fragments of these early mystical treatises preserved in the Cairo genizah. Only few of them have been studied, but now we have before us the impressive volume prepared by Peter Schäfer, which includes photographs, Hebrew text, detailed notes, and comparative tables to the texts included in Schäfer's Synopse zur Hekhalot Literatur, Tiibingen 1981. 23 Geniza fragments are included in this edition, which enables the scholar to integrate this material into his study of Hekhalot mysticism. The most important aspects of these texts concern the Shiur Komah, the mystical anthropomorphic description of God, and various mystical-magical texts. BOOK REVIEW: SARAH KAMIN, RASHrS EXEGETICAL CATEGORIZATION IN RESPECT TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PESHAT AND DERASH, JERUSALEM 1986 by Elazar Touitou In this book, Kamin attempts to clarify Rashi's exegetical consciousness and to decide whether the terms 'פשוטו של מקרא' and 'מדרשו' are identical to the terms יפשט' and 'דרשי used today. She concludes that Rashi did not distinguish between the two categories יפשט' and 'דרש'. Kamin examines the significance attached by Rashi to the terms 'פשוטו' and 'מדרשו' and explains that Rashi meant two things: on the one hand he was concerned that the commentary not exceed the simple meaning, while on the other hand, he maintained a flowing commentary, which presented the unit of commentary as a whole. Kamin has made great strides both in the methodological sphere and in clarifying several basic points in Rashi's Biblical exegesis. Despite this, we list two deficiencies in this important work: the lack of a historical background to the emergence of Rashi's commentary. Such a discussion would have no doubt shed light on Rashi's techniques, and on the exegetical concepts behind these techniques. The second deficiency is the author's failure to deal with the problematics connected with determining the text of Rashi's commentary. The text of the Berliner edition, which serves as Kamin's basis, is not always reliable. We bring several examples used by Kamin in which the manuscript version differs from the Berliner edition in a significant way, and which may challenge some of her conclusions.</page></plain_text>
