<plain_text><page sequence="1">Musical Instruments in an Ethnographic Museum ANDRE SCHAEFFNER TRANSLATED BY DOMINIC FACCINI The following notes are not intended to advance a method of classification for a museum of extra-European musical instruments; rather, they detail the difficulties of a study related exclusively to musical instruments and ethnogra- phy. Ethnography necessarily involves the acknowledgment that no object of musical or sound production, however primitive, however formless it may seem, no instrument--whether essentially or accidentally musical-shall be excluded from methodical classification. Within such classification, percussive procedures on wooden chests or upon the earth itself are of no less importance than the melodic or polyphonic resources of the violin or guitar. It is to the travelers, missionaries, and ethnographers that the history of musical instruments owes its only detailed descriptions of objects and techniques that musicologists have ignored and continue to neglect through the same prejudice which leads art historians to reject expressions such as: Negro art, Indian art, or South Sea island art. We were, in the course of a partial examination of documents on the music of American and African Negroes from the sixteenth century to the present, unable to make use of concrete details from anything but travelogues.' Now, it is only on condition that nothing of a people's musical life be deemed unworthy of examination that we can consider a general study of instrument- making and scoring throughout history and the five continents, and, conse- quently, of auditory sensuality in its full range of fantasy. We do not claim, of course, that the intentions of the composers of the Choral Symphony's scherzo or The Rite of Spring will become clearer to us simply because we will have analyzed the Negro's modes of rhythmic drumming. Invariable elements do, however, lurk within all stages of musical culture; we should attend to the variety of their combinations, just as there is no word in a language which does not help us to decipher it. 1.

It concedes, moreover, that art serves other ends, those of religion, magic, war, hunting, gaming, language. Since it is not born in a vacuum, art can not be isolated. If teaching the Gregorian chant in the conservatory represents recent progress in this regard, we must not expect the study of more distant musics-linked to rituals, languages, and actions foreign to us-to begin for quite some time. Insofar as the Gregorian chant and ancient instruments of European origin are related to the archeology or to the "prehistory" of our music, place has been granted them in our con- servatories, and in the museums associated with them. As for collections of instruments-and all related studies-which do not fall within the scope of the musical curriculum of our conservatories but refer to other civilizations, to other forms of linkage between art and human practices in general, they nec- essarily elude the conservatory in principle and their methods in practice, for they cannot match ethnography's flexibility and range. To arrange musical instruments in an ethnographic museum is to risk scattering them among objects related only by geography, method of fabrication, or external form. A compromise solution would require an autonomous clas- sification of instruments in the museum-the showcase entirely assigned to them not being excluded from rooms specific to objects from the same continent. The possibility of bringing together a culture's minor objects would thus be safeguarded. This seems to us an essential principle of ethnography. The wooden drums that we find in the South Sea islands, in Indian America as in black Africa, would gain nothing from being juxtaposed: their differences are of less concern to the study of musical instruments as such than to the history of primitive religions or the plastic arts. An African drum assumes the ritual form of a cow, whereas a drum from the New Hebrides, a huge phallic post, calls to mind other similarly sculpted tree trunks, and indeed, by the face surmounting it, certain of the same islands' figures made from arborescent fern root. Here considerations of a plastic nature, of purely external typology, prevail over characteristics of sound as such. Knowledge of how these wooden drums sound matters less than understanding their affinity with other objects of wor- ship; it's important to note the sculptural expression claimed as formed by higher powers or the inspiration for the fixation upon them of a fearful and adoring imagination. With these drum-idols or drum-statues begins the series of instruments that are by no means exclusively restricted to music. We know, of course, that organs with parallel pipes and voluptuously sculpted cases were part of church decoration; organs enlivened by a parade of automatons; there exist harpsi- chords and clavichords whose lids the master's brush transformed into veritable easel paintings, so that one could not tell which was the excrescence, the instru- ment, or the work of art. But in the case of the tree-drums from the New</page><page sequence="4">Musical Instruments in an Ethnographic Museum 35 : _ : ; . : .: : : ~ i---_:_-:-i::: ..:;:-: :. .: :_ii_ -~::- ...'.

Hebrides, is it a matter of a more decorative enrichment? Aren't we rather facing an object whose cylindrical form lent itself to the double existence of statue and wooden drum, and, if either idea had priority, might it not have been the statue? A sound statue whose form and use, with all its religious and magical trappings, commands the ceremony of dances which takes place around it.2 The African bovine-drum, similarly, hardly represents a musical instrument in its pure state. Shaped like a cow, it acquires a quite different meaning; certainly a symbol of fertility, would it call forth the voices as spontaneously as if its form had been less precise? Without wishing to ascribe a ritual character to the object, we simply note a formal intention that is neither musical nor decorative in character. Other instruments, this time clearly anthropomorphic, present us with other points of intersection between the plastic arts and the study of musical instruments; they also inspire doubt as to their wholly musical use. In Africa, there is a sort of guitar whose strings are braced, like those of a harp, along a plane perpendicular to that of the table or back and compel the neck to bend in caricatural fashion; at the upper extremity of the neck a little man's head emerges, while the sounding board suggests the form of a large bust, without 2.

The instrument thus stands upright like an ordinary statuette. Certain anatomical details, particularly sexual ones, are indicated with precision by the sculptor;3 and finally, certain sounding boards are said to be made of human skin. What are we to conclude from an anthropomorphism taken to this extreme? Does the fact that it represents a human being give this guitar a special, extramusical meaning? Was there at the outset a decorative fantasy on the part of the instrument maker? Does the statuette act to set this type of guitar apart from other instruments? In every case, this object concerns equally the study of plastic arts and the study of musical instruments; at this point of intersection it belongs above all to the ethnographic museum, which will take account of the psychological turmoil highlighted by its origin and use. A last example, a whistle-figurine of Mexican construction, shows us a work which would appear, formally, to suffice unto itself; yet within it hides a musical instrument. This is not an example of the many whistles and ocarinas of Peru and Central America which, more or less as decoys or toys, express their function for us in a zoomorphic form.4 This is a statuette whose ceramic delicacy hardly lets us suspect that it surrounds a whistle. The plastic object deprives us of the sight of the instrument, whereas in the case of the drum-statues and the anthropomorphic guitar, the play of volume and outline had been applied to the essential traits of instrument mak- ing. Similarly, the object's exterior form lent itself to the instrumentalist's ges- tures, while the Mexican artist has no concern for the whistler. There is no coincidence whatever between art object and instrument, but a harmony be- tween the two, one empirically containing the other. Of such instruments, which are also objects of idolatry and of art, we know neither which of the two prevailed, nor in what way they acted upon the instrumentalist's psychology. To them correspond other instruments whose technique we cannot precisely determine. Generally, and up to a certain point, every instrument may presuppose several techniques applicable to it, yet one would appear to be less accidental than the others. A Spanish guitar also solicits the percussion of its strings, indeed of its sounding board. The violin's province is not limited to sounds produced by strokes of the bow, but includes pizzicati sounds through direct plucking of the strings, so that we may say that the violin extends from the violin to the guitar to the harp. But where is one to class such instrumental monsters as the clavichord or the "organized" spinet, whose keys act sometimes on chords, at other times on organ pipes, perhaps even on the two timbres at once?5 And how could one not consign to the Dupuytren museum 3. See the instrument belonging to M. Hessel and reproduced in Cahiers d'art, nos. 7-8, 1927. 4. See R. and M. d'Harcourt, La Musique des Incas et ses survivances (Paris: Geuthmer, 1925), pp. 69-78 and pp. XXVIII-XXXII. 5. See our study on le clavecin (the clavichord) in: Encyclopedie de la musique, second part (Paris: Delagrave).</page><page sequence="6">Musical Instruments in an Ethnographic Museum 37 of music another clavichord within which, like tumors or cancers, dwarf instru- ments had grown, parasites of the parent body?6 The study of exotic instruments is certainly unfamiliar with such states of madness, but we better understand the superimpositions of techniques within a single instrument and, better still, we grasp the ways in which an instrument, despite or because of its form, can pass from one technique to another or combine two quite different modes of sound production: mixtures and deviations. The simplest case is offered by the so-called nose or nasal flute, found in Africa as well as in the South Sea islands and America and which uses the air exhaled from a nostril. Now, it is not proven that any mouth flute cannot be taken for a nasal flute and inversely that any so-called nasal flute may not also be an ordinary flute. This is properly a case of the perversion of an instrument, when an unpredictable technique is sud- denly preferred to the latter's normal technique, but without the new technique ceasing to be natural, that is to say within the nature of the instrument. To this example of a mouth flute becoming nasal we can add the case of the Javanese vahila which passes from a plucked bark instrument to its definitive state as an instrument of percussion (krumba). Surely no form of instrument implies a determined procedure to which human fantasy cannot add a different means of sound production; even if form springs from the definite desire for a certain technique, a whim always risks subverting the instrument. These remarks demonstrate the need for verification by photography. Next to the exhibit there must be a photograph of the player, of the silent object, its position in the hands of he who suddenly brings it to life, making it multiply. But in an ethnographic museum this is not photographic reproduc- tion's only function. Always coupled with the phonograph, it also preserves for us the idea of instruments such that the player becomes paramount, that through his efforts nature becomes a direct source of sound. Instruments of open air: man beats the sea or the air with arms or feet; he inserts between the slightest breeze and the ear the trembling of a blade of grass, the trap of a fiber. Here is our most poignant sense of man's immense musical need. In this insect's invention, from amid such rudimentary materials, and in the limitless delight that a Negro, for example, finds there, is there not more real music than in the playing of a pianist who, unable to construct his instrument, is no more capable of finding the right phrasing, the expression of a piece by Schumann or Debussy? Natural instruments (although in a sense all are) but which would be annihilated if photography did not conserve their process. Thus to Marcel Griaule we owe an account from Abyssinia (1929) of what he calls "earth drum," which consists of beating the ground at the site of two holes of differing depth. Is there a more primitive instrument, whose bare existence remains more elu- sive? Musician of the earth. 6. Le Clavecin, etc.</page><page sequence="7">38 OCTOBER Earth Drum from the Wollo (Ethiopia). :: The need for nomenclature gives rise to other difficulties. Our habit of dictionaries constrains us to absolutely give a name to every instrument, either a native or a European one, whence a dual source of errors and gaps. For the native name of an instrument varies from one tribe to another; we find the exact same descriptions of similar instruments under a dozen names. And, however invaluable Curt Sachs's Reallexikon der Musikinstrumente, its author works only with limited means of comparison; the result is an excessive restriction of the possible variety of characteristics of a given instrument. Is he certain that a flute from a given South Sea island has not, under a given native name, a greater or lesser number of pipes than he specifies? The multiplicity of native terms sometimes exceeds the moderate variety of instruments; sometimes a fixed name hides a plethora of instruments. But to apply the names of our instruments to native instruments would be even more dangerous. This leads to arbitrary assimilations, and takes no account of the psychological nuances we tried to point out with reference to the New Hebrides drum or the anthropo- morphic guitar. And why give the name violin to Arab or Javanese instruments which have less in common with a violin than does our cello? We need a wide variety of precise terms, as subtle as possible, to designate modes of sound production, and respect their perpetual divergence. Similar scruples should be exercised in any comparative study of the ranges of sound formed by the instruments themselves. One would have to ask oneself first of all if the instrument doesn't create its own scales or whether, through the skill of the instrument maker who chooses the strings and pierces the pipes, the instrument is not submitted to a priori scales; by how much do the empir-</page><page sequence="8">Musical Instruments in an Ethnographic Museum 39 ically obtained scales clash with the theoretical scales; which of the two is truly heard; what disparity is there between the scales the natives believe they hear and those which their imperfect instruments make to our ears? From then on one would have to find out whether, for such peoples, the scales in themselves hold the aesthetic and psychological importance that our own scales have ac- quired in our music, that they had with the Greeks and the Chinese; whether scales are not the sole melodic means found by natives, whether it represents their entire melodic invention--whereas our scales form only a sound material with which the melody plays. It is our belief that in this domain musical eth- nography and aesthetics together should provide information of great value.
