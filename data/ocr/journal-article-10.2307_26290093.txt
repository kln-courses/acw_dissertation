"Exlit," CE 38 (November, 1976), 287-91. External literature—science fiction, mayhem, horror, and who dunit—parallels the metaphysical positions of the rationalist, sceptic, mystic and dogmatist. The New Testament presents the whodunit pattern upside-down. [MH] 4440 Nauer, Barbara. Rise Up and Remember.- Garden City, New York: Doubieday, 1977. Paper, 110 pp., $2.95. Barbara Nauer, who currently teaches at Loyola University, has written a powerful spiri tual autobiography of her journey from rapturous childhood belief in the Real Presence, through divorce, despair, and near-suicide, to conversion and joy. Now a Catholic Charismatic, Professor Nauer graphically describes the conflict between rationalism and supernatural ism. Particularly fascinating are her descriptions of the teaching and counselling methods of Father Walter J. Ong (who is not named in the text, but is named in the book's dedication and unmistakably de scribed for anyone who has met him and heard him speak). It is appar ent that Father Ong's faith, his research, and his teaching are like the coat of Jesus, "without seam, woven from the top throughout." Both his example, and Professor Nauer's moving book, demonstrate the truth of Teilhard de Chardin's remark: "There is less difference than people think between research and adoration." [VRM] 4441 Ryan, John D. "Story and Religion," Cross C, XXVI (Fall, 1976), 350-57. Three books explore "the current suggestion that relig ious meanings are fundamentally, and most deeply, carried in story": Religion as Story, ed. James B. Wiggins; Wesley A. Kort, Narrative Bibliography / 42</page><page sequence="3">Elements and Religious Meaning; Brian Wicker, The Story-Shaped World. The first is a collection of essays which d&lt;&gt;'-s not quite match its ■ promise to provide an interdisciplinary exploration of religion and story. The second explores the relationship between basic elements of narrative and religious acts by examining modern works of fiction; Kort's basically suggestive insights are not fully unpacked. The third "seriously tackles the relation of story-truth and philosophic (and religious) truth" by examining the complementarity of metaphor ical and analogical language. Ryan concludes with an observation that the renewed interest in story as an expression of the "religious dimension" may portend "a new wave of significant theology." [JE] 4442 Thomas, W.K. "The Underside of Utopias," CE, 38 (December, 1976), 356- 72. Each Utopia tends to have a dark underside, usually emphasized through the presence of a diabolic tempter. Materialist Utopias like Waiden Two and Looking Backward, 2000-1887 inadvertently expose the absence of spiritual values by biblical quotations and allusions taken out of context. [MHj OLD ENGLISH 4443 Berkhout, Carl T. "The Problem of OE 'Holmwudu' " MS, 36 (1974), 429-33. The word "holmwudu" in line 91 of "The Dream of the Rood" is best translated as "seawood" or "ship." This translation is better on etymological grounds than the emendation to "haewudu" mean ing "trees of the forest," the reading of "holm" as "mill," which makes it "wood on the mill," or the reading of it as "holm-tree," re ferring to the "tree of Golgotha." "Seawood" or "ship" introduces an image utilized by Augustine, thus developing the poem's theological concepts. 4444 Hill, Joyce. "A Sequence of Associations in the Composition of Christ 275-347," RES, 27 (August, 1976), 296-299. By associations suggested by an Ambrosian hymn, the Anglo-Saxon poet moved from Eze kiel 's vision of the ideal Temple (44:1-2) to an extended image of Mary's virginity. [LB] 4445 Jolliffe, P.S. "Middle English Translations of OE Exterioris Et Interioris Hominis Compositione," MS, 36 (1974), 259-77. Textual comparison indicates that the two ME Texts known as Formula Noviciorum are translations of David of Augsbury's De Exterioris et Interioris Hominis Compositione. The comparison further indicates the existence of other English texts of the work. That this work, originally intended for religious leaders, should have been translated, suggests a growing need among laymen for works of advanced spiritual direction. 4446 Rice, Robert Charles. "Soul's Need: A Critical Study of the Penitential Motif in Old English Poetry," DA, 35 (February, 1975), 5360-A (U. of Oregon). The penitential motif is a substantial one in Old English religious poetry, specifically in Fates of the Apostles, Elene, Christ II, and Juliana (the Cynewulf cnnr&gt;n) and Dream of the Road, Christ I and Christ III (the Cynewulf group). In these works the sub-motifs of sorrow, bondage, moral infirmity, and fear of impending fate also have a penitential suggestiveness and indicate the moral significance of the concept and practice of penance in the literature. [SPM] Bibliography / 43</page><page sequence="4">MIDDLE ENGLISH 4447 Baker, Denise N. "The Priesthood of Genius: A Study of the Medieval Tradition," Speculum, 51 (April, 1976)-, 2 7 7-9 1 . "The Genius of the Confessio Amantis ... is not an inconsistent figure but rather a complex and sophisticated assimilation of. his two pre cursors in the literary tradition— . . .De planctu Naturae and the Roman de la Rose." Genius in this poem has a dual priesthood, being both a priest of Venus and an orthodox priest, and thus he is "repre sentative not only of man's carnal nature but also of his rationality . . . [RS] 4448 Clark, Roy Peter. "Christmas Games in Chaucer's 'The Miller's Tale'," SSF, 13 (Summer, 1976), 277-87. Several critics have found elements of religious parody in "The Miller's Tale." These elements become more significant if the tale is seen as a Christmas story. The hero is Nicholas, there are games which seem much like fourteenth century Christmas games, and characters seem to symbolize Nativity figures. [MHM] 4449 Foley, Michael M. "Gawain's Two Confessions Reconsidered," ChauR, 9, i (Summer, 1974), 73-79. In this work the hero's re tention of the lady's girdle, in violation of the exchange-of-winnings bargain, is not a mortal sin but a minor offense. His fault, motivated by cowardice, is against the knightly rather than the Christian code; which is appropriately revealed when he confesses before a knight rather than a priest. Gawain is a hero more notable for his Christian rectitude than for his gladiatorial skill of courtly manners. 4450 Hieatt, Constance B. " 'The Fates of the Apostles': Imagery, Structure, and Meaning," PLL, 10, ii (Spring, 1974), 115-25. Adverse criticism of this poem overlooks its sophisticated world view, significant imagery, and structural subtleties. One structural princi pal is the inclusion of a paradox in almost every account of Individ- • ual apostles. The images and metaphors "are tied together in a structure that suggests a progression which goes something like Christ-saints poet-reader-humanity-God." 4451 Hill, Thomas D- "Parody and Theme in the Middle English Land of Cokaygne," N&amp;Q, 22 (February,1975), 55-59. Although this work has folkloristic elements, its author was "a sophisticated and self conscious artist" who relied upon parody for much of his comic effect. Specifically, he inverts the sorrow of Elias and Enoch lacking company and wine for their journey—things abundant In Cokaygne; parodies a well-known topos, the seven joys of heaven, by distortion; and, in the flying scene, the metaphorical "flight" of contemplatives. The scene of nuns swimming in milk alludes to an iconographie image of Heaven in the expanded Visio Pauli: it is significant that in the Visio, the river of milk is associated with chastity—something the nuns in Cokaygne lack. 4452 Muratore, Jane Crawford. "The Christian Humanism of St. Gregory of Nazianzus," Cithara, 15 (November, 1975), 23-26. "Of all the early Church Fathers, St. Gregory of Nazianzus perhaps best deserves the title of 'Christian Humanist' because of his life-long struggle, both in his life and writing, to achieve a Christian-classical synthe sis." His "career and work may be summed up as the attempt to build a Bibliography / 44</page><page sequence="5">Christian culture for the future based upon harmony with the classi cal past." [RS] 4453 Pennington, Kenneth. "The Canonists and Pluralism in the Thirteenth Century," Speculum, 51 (January, 1976), 35-48. Several thirteenth-century canonists, including, especially, Johannes Teutonicus, Tancred, and Hostiensis, attempted to preserve episcopal jurisdictional rights against the authority of the pope. Thus;the "textbook picture we have of the thirteenth-century canonists prepar ing the way for papal absolution within the church . . . must be nuanced." [RS] 4454 Wee, David. "The Temptation of Christ and the Motif of Divine Duplicity in the Corpus Christi Cycle," MP, 72 (August, 1974), 1-17. The play of the temptation of Christ which occurs in the York, Chester, and Ludus Coventriae Cycles, often strikes the 20th century reader as naive. But an examination of appropriate biblical texts and other sources shows the plav to be biblically supported and an inte gral part of each cycle. A grammatical examination of the scriptural story suggests that Satan was certain of Christ's divinity during the temptation and thus explains his apparent lack of motivation. Patris tic sources support the idea of the divine plan to deceive Satan and facilitate the salvation of man. RENAISSANCE 4455 Bangs, Jeremy D. "Maerten van Heemskerck's Bel and the Dragon and Iconoclasra," Ren Q, 30 (Spring, 1977), 8-11. The apocry phal story of Bel and the Dragon provided "the strongest biblical parallel for iconoclasra"; stained glass panels used the legend to portray "contemporary events in the Low Countries." [MH] 4456 Baumann, Fred E. "Murtianus Rufus and Natural Religion: a Test Case," Ren Q, 29 (Winter, 1976), 567-98. Murtianus, delib &lt;3 erately obscure in his writings, actually concluded that "a choice has to be made between Socrates and Jesus. . . .Murtianus1 Neo-Platon ic and 'Docetist' teachings are the means to a Platonic choice in that they destroy the possibility of the Christian alternative." [MH] 4457 Bean, John C. "Passion Versus Friendship in the Tudor Matri monial Handbooks and Some Shakespearean Implications," WascanaR, 9 (1974), 231-40. This article treats the paradox of romantic love leading to matrimony and sexual consummation in Shakespeare's comedies in contradistinction with the passion of Amor Courtois, which is irre concilable with Christian marriage. All 16th century matrimonial handbooks attacked romantic love and endorsed friendship rather than passion in marriage. "4458 Bovard, Richard W.

Shakespeare's comedies'demonstrate thematic interest in language—from human words to the Word of God. 4459 Frit-Kner. Donald N.

These themes are crucial Christian and central Calvinist doctrines. 4460 Harcourt, John B. "'Odde Old Ends, Stolne...': King Richard and Saint Paul," ShakS, 7 (1974), 87-100. "By Saint Paul," Richard Ill's favorite expletive, gi^es a hint to his characteriza tion by Shakespeare. It suggests a Pauline theme in the play, that of man able to accept or reject grace and therein find his freedom or misery. 4461 Kaske, Carol V. "The Bacchus Who Wouldn't Wash: Faerie Queene II.i-ii," Ren Q, 29 (Summer, 1976), 195-209. The unsuccessful attempt to wash Ruddymane is an inversion of the classical theme of the nymphs washing Bacchus. Spenser interweaves the bloody babe of Ezekiel 16 to fabric an allegory of original sin and baptism; the washing is unsuccessful, making the episode a "Tragedie." [MH] 4462 Kiessling, Nicolas K. "The Winter's Tale,It.iii.103-07 : An Allusion to the Hag-Incubus,"^, 28 (Winter, 1977), 93-95. Pauline prays that Leontes's daughter may not come to suspect, as her father does, that her children are not her own, and refers to the tradition of thé incubus which can father children or replace them with changelings. [LB] 4463 Levitsky, Ruth M. "Shylock as Unregenerate Man," SQ, 28 (Winter, 1977), 58-64. Shylock is not, as he says, "fed with the same food" as Christians, because he refuses the tutelage of Christian revelation and Scripture; he also, thus, refuses the nourishment 'if the Hebrew tradition, which Shakespeare would have believed led to reconciliation with the Christian tradition. [LB] 4464 Oates, Joyce Carol. "Is This the Promised End? The Tragedy of King Lear," JAAC, 33 (1974), 19-32. The "promised end" is the Apocalypse in one sense; in another, it is the inevitable horror that follows when nature (for woman) is given freedom to act spontaneously, to upset ritual against masculine authority. Cordelia, like Christ, is an inevitable victim. 4465 Rosenberg, Charles M. '"'Per il bene di. . . nostra cipta': Borso d'Este and the Certosa of Ferrara," Ren Q, 29 (Autumn, 1976), 329-40. Borso d'Este's reasons for establishing the Certosa "are illustrative of the fundamental assumptions underlying fifteenth century aristocratic support of religious foundations"; Borso's sponsorship "must be seen as an investment in the future salvation of his soul." [MH] 4466 Smith, Jonathan C. "Destiny Reversed: A Study of Biblical and Classical Allusion Patterns in Shakespeare's Henry VI," DAI, 35 (1974), 2242-3-A (Indiana). Allusions evoke the poetic myth of Britain divine destiny, and reveal the parody and perversion of that myth in the era of Henry VI. 4467 Trinkaus, Charles. "Humanism, Religion, Society: Concepts and Motivations of Some Recent Studies," Ren Q, 29 (Winter, 1976), 673-713. The danger for historians "is to identify their own partisan ships with those of the past"; major distortions in Renaissance Bibliography / 46</page><page sequence="7">historiography of the twentieth century are the attempt "to locate the beginning of rationalism and political liberalism in that period," and the acceptance of "the Renaissance's own myth that it alone brought about a rebirth of classical antiquity." [MH] 4468 Waswo, Richard. "Damnation, Protestant Style: Macbeth, Faustus, and Christian Tragedy," JMRS, 4 (1974), 63-99. Shakespeare brings us face to face with the mystery of iniquity. Macbeth's knowledge that he had no justification for his deeds is the moral dilemma defined by the Calvinist doctrine of sin and evil, the con sequence of original sin. His awareness and revulsion of his conscience constitute the grounds of his destruction. Marlow, in Dr. Faustus, shows us how it feels to be damned; in Macbeth, Shake speare shows us what it means. 4469 Webster, Richard. "Two Hells: Comparison and Contrast Between Dante and Shakespeare with Particular Reference to Inferno, X and Richard III, I, IV (Part 1)," NMS, 18 (1974), 17-28. Dante's hell is the greatest "llrbanistica" there is; Shakespeare's hell is an "unweeded garden." Dante's vision is logical, or metaphorically so; Shakespeare gives us an inexhaustible run of inconsistent metaphors. SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 4470 Arner, Robert D. "Pastoral Celebration and Satire in Thomas r Morton's New English Canaan," Criticism, 16 (Summer, 1974), 217-31. Part three of Morton's New English Canaan is a satiric attack on the Puritans and Separatists, containing "desolate landscapes and allusions to the underworld." 4471 Blessington, Francis C. "Autotheodicy: The Father as Orator in Paradise Lost," Cithara, 14 (May, 1975), 49-60. "In Paradise Lost, Milton casts the Father in the role of an orator who successfully adheres to Aristotle's three modes of persuasion." As a result, the Father "succeeds oratorically both within and without the poem"; he not only convinces the Son and the angels, but also convinces the reader. [RS] 4472 Clancy, Thomas H. English Catholic Books, 1641-1700: A Bibli ography. (Loyola University Press, 1974), 157 pp. The purpose of this book is "to give abridged entries of all 'English' books written by Roman Catholics and published in the Roman Catholic inter est between 1641 and 1700 inclusive." 4473 Dees, Jerome S. "The Narrator of Christ's Victorie and Triumph: What Giles Fletcher Learned from Spenser," ELR, 6 (Autumn, 1976), 453-565. While Fletcher develops "a narrative voice and strategy" which imitate Spenser, he "also discovers and makes central. . . implications which were in Spenser's poem underdeveloped or peripheral." For Fletcher, the significant action occurs "deep within the mind, and not in "outward shows"; his overriding preoccupation is with escaping time. [MH] 4474 Demaray, John G. "Love's Epic Revel in Paradise Lost: A Theatri cal Vision of Marriage," MLQ, 38 (March, 1977), 3-20. In Book VI Milton includes "transformed and idealized elements from a masque of Hymen" to dramatize "man's brief moment of ideal joy before the Fall." (MH] Bibliography / 47</page><page sequence="8">4475 Donaldson-Evans, Lance-K. "Two Baroque Devotional Poets: La Ceppede and Alabaster," CLS, 21 (March, 1975),. 21-31. Influenced by the meditative tradition and the post-Renaissance de votional revival, the poetry of William Alabaster (English) and Jean de La Ceppede (French) indicates "the breadth of the European devotional revival of the Baroque period." Among the poetic simi larities of the artists from two nations are the following: a portrait of Christ's death beginning immediately after the Last Supper opens each work; a military metaphor provides the framework, for the introduction of Christ; each poet describes Christ's cross ing of the Brook of Cedron, treated symbolically, and Christ's descent into Hell. For each the Ensigns of Christ's Crucifying," such as the crown of thorns and the reed held by Christ during his trial, become symbolic. [SPM] 4476 Harraan, Barbara Leah, "The Misconducted Poem: Experience in George Herbert's Poetry," DA, 35 (December, 1974), 3681-A (Brandeis U.). The poems "Affliction (I)," "The Collar,-" "The Flower," "Redemption," "The Holdfast," "Dialogue," "The Reprisall," and "Love (III)," are about religious failure—failure to see clearly, to understand the meaning of service, to love well, or to be perfect in devotion. The speakers are often mis-speakers or misreaders. Because what a speaker learns in one poem must be learned again in a following poem, the poetic accomplishment is "negative accomplishment undoing, unlearning, overcoming." This poetry of "negative accomplish ment" is consistent with the prohibitions of religious poetry. [SPM] 4477 Hartwig, Joan. "Double Time in Andrew Marvell's 'Bermudas,"' RenP, (1974), .51-59. One may justly read this poem in historical context of Puritans being exiled from England. However, the island is a "dramatic metaphor," for nature throughout is understood as an arti fact: "this art, of course, is God's art." The fruits described are both temporal and non-mutable: "they are very clearly the same fruits found in descriptions of paradisal scriptural gardens." Thus, "these rowers keep the time, durationally, but also eternally, as they figure nan's progress in stasis toward an eternity that he already knows." 4478 Levitt, Paul M. "Crashaw's 'The Weeper', 113-14," Expl, 32 (March, 1974), 56. In these allusive, metaphysical lines the eyes and tears of Mary Magadalene stand for the waters of baptism, a tearful universe (rain), and the sorrow of the world, to be endured for the death of Christ'. 4479 Lieb, Michaèl. "Paradise Lost, Book III: The Dialogue in Heaven Reconsidered," RenP (1974), 39-50. The interchange in this book between God and his Son contains noticeable parallels of Old Testament conversations of Abraham (in Genesis) and Moses (in Exodus) with God. In Milton's work and in the Old Testament episodes, God's indignation is challenged, and "the Son's willingness to sacrifice himself for man" reaffirms the Old Testament parallel. 4480 Opie, B. J. "The Devil, Science, and Subjectivity," ELR, 6 (Adtumn 1976), 430-52. In three sets of sermons on Christ's temptation in the wilderness by Lancelot Andrewes, William Perkins, and John Uclall, "the dominant concern...is the determination of true knowledge, as tfre necessary though not sufficient basis for the conduct of a regenerate life."

"Satan and t.he Satan Figure in the Poetry of William B^ake," DA, 35 (February, 1975), 5335-6A (U. of Georgia). An ironic devil of energy, an idea of the real devil on the cosmic level in the form of Urizen, and the spectre representing an idea of the real devil on the individual level are Blake's Satanic figures in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, America, Europe, and The Book of Ahania. They prove Blake an unconventional Satanist. In his treat ment of the Satanic figures, he uses traditional Satan imagery from the Bible and Milton to depict Urizen and Swedenberg's idea of, and imagery of, "selfhood" to depict the spectre. His own Satan, em bodying the debased state of the human soul and its values, is depicted by his own personal symbolism. [SPM] 4483 Bernhard, Virginia. "Cotton Mather and the Doing of Good: A Puritan Gospel of Wealth," NEQ, 49 (June, 1976), 225-41. In his Essays to Do Good, Cotton Mather "set out to bind together and reform ... a covetous, contentious society by imploring it to do good, inform against sinners, and contribute to the poor." But in stead of thereby contributing to the building of a new holy community, Cotton's tract had the inadvertent effect of "[reinforcing] the values —individualism, acquisitiveness, and a competitive spirit—that he hoped to combat." [RS 1 44154 Brantley, Richard E. "Johnson's Wesleyan Connection," ECS, 10 (Winter, 1976-77), 143-68. Johnson had many affiliations with the Wesleyan movement; though at first suspecting them of enthusiasm, he changed his opinion through contacts with the Wesleys and through his own religious experience in later life. [LB] 4485. Downie, J.A. "Defoe's Review, the Theatre, and Anti-High-Church Propaganda," RECTR, 15 (May, 1976), 24-32. After 1708, Daniel Defoe contributed effectively to the Review's anti-High-Church propa ganda, the theme of which was "that the High-Church party was the mainstay of theatrical patronage." This charge was fundamentally unjust. [RS] 4486 Gotfried, Paul E. "Kunst und Politik bei Burke und Novalis," Zeitschrift Fur Ästhetik und Allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft, 19 (1974), 240-51. In its aesthetics, the romantic movement made much of th'e analogy between divine creation and a work of art. Novalis went further than Burke and developed a theology of art; he was the first to suggest that salvation could be attained through art. 4487 Hartman, Geoffrey A. "Christopher Smart's Magnificat: Toward a Theory of Representation," ELH, 41 (1974), 429-54. Smart "shows mankind 'presenting' before God the animal creation it has ex ploited." 44Ö8 Kalmey, Robert Pohl. "The Christian Vision of Pope's Eloisa to Ahelard," DA, 35 (December, 1974), 3686-A (U. of Florida). Drawing heavily on The Letters of Abelard and Heloise (1713), Pope places Elolsa's drama within a liturgical and devotional context. He dramatizes the human psyche under the twin disciplines of law and ad versity and the action of divine grace upon Floisa's otherwise hope less dilemma between desire and devotion. The poem depends on a confessional and liturgical structure which "supports its Christian vision of human nature struggling to justify itself before a just but merciful God."

"Henry Fielding, the Preacher: A Study of the Layman's Sermons in Historical and Rhetorical Context," DA, 35 (February, 1975), 5425-6A (U. of Nebraska). Pulpit rhetoric, clearly distinguished from classical rhetoric particularly in organi zation, is the model for some moral essays in Fielding's Journals, his one known sermon, The Crisis, and certain direct homilies within his novels. A focus on the exposure of corrupt clergy in his plays and novels and his portraits of paragon clergymen in the novels again illustrate Fielding's self-conscious role of Christian moralist and his efforts to broaden the established definitions of sermon and preacher. [SPM] 4491 Siebert, Donald T., Jr. "Cibber and Satan: The Dunciad and Civilization,". ECS, 10 (Winter 1976-77), 203-21, Pope's pre vailing mode in The Dunciad is not theological-horrific, but theolog ical-comic, with thé Dunces far less seriously threatening than many critics argue, and the figure of Satan-Antichrist in Cibber a comic figure insofar as he participates in his own downfall under the provi dence of Pope. [LB] 4492 Stein, Stephen J. "Jonathan Edwards and the Rainbow: Biblical Exegesis and Poetic Imagination," NEQ, 47 (1974), 440-56. Work ing from Edwards's private notebooks of commentaries on scripture, Stein analyzes Edwards's exegesis of the story of Noah and the rain bow (Genesis 9:12ff.), showing how he combined his scientific observa tions of the phenomenon of-the rainbow with a complex theological interpretation stressing the rainbow as an image of the covenant of Grace. 4493 West, Michael. "Shifting Concepts of Heroism in Dryden's Panegyrics," PLL, 10 (1974), 378-93. Dryden's economia "move from hero-worship to a profound mistrust of the hero," and a conse quent effort to redefine heroic standards in Christian terms. 4494 Ziegler, Robert J. "Edward Gibbon and Julian the Apostate," PLL, 10 (Spring, 1974) 136-49. Gibbon's account of Julian is interesting for its contribution to the 18th century ideological dis pute over the emperor. While one might have expected Gibbon to share the philosophes' approval of Julian's hostility toward the church, Gibbon actually wrote a reasonable, impartial account, considering both Julian's innate religiosity and his devious and untrustworthy character. Gibbon's guarded treatment of the controversial figure may have been prompted in part by his discomfort at charges of anti Christian bias. NINETEENTH CENTURY 4495 Barcus, James E. "Structuring the Rage Within: the Spiritual Autobiographies of Newman and drestes Brown.son," Cithara, 15 (November, 1975), 45-57. Both men attempt in their spiritual auto-, biographies to resolve the psychological chaos tormenting them by providing a construct which explains and which imposes a pattern on Bibliography / 50</page><page sequence="11">that chaos. For Newman this construct involves a self-conception of "a religious conscience so tender, so respondent to the impact of his life on others, that he delays conversion and risks self-damnation for the «ell-being of those unsettled in their faith"; for Brownson the "solution to the chaos within and without is an appeal to logic and reason, an argument based on consistency to first principles." [RS] 4496 Eggenschwiler, David. "Byron's Cain and the Antimythological Myth," MLQ, 37 (December, 1976), 324-38. Cain should be read as "a play about the biblical myth." Byron treats the myth ironically, revealing its "absurdities, evil and dangers" while finally absorbing us "in its basic symbolic truth." As dramatic experiment in the use of myth, Cain is a "forerunner of much modern drama." [MH] 4497 Johnson, Claudia G. "'Young Goodman Brown' and Puritan Justi fication," SSF, 11 (Spring, 1974), 200-03. According to the Puritan doctrine of justification, man must descend within himself and be "utterly reduced by a sense of sin." However, many sinners merely convince themselves that they have had this descent—Goodman Brown is one such sinner. He becomes more sensitive to the sins of others than to his own. [MHM] 4498 Kesterson, David B. "Nature and Hawthorne's Religious Isola tionists," NHJ (1974), 196-208. Since Hawthorne believed man must be in harmony with nature and man, he used nature imagery to point out the errors of his religious isolationists. "Young Good man Brown," "The Minister's Black Veil," "Endicott and the Red Cross,'' and "The Gentle Boy" contain sunshine imagery representing God's approval in contrast with darkness or clouds symbolizing preoccupa tion with the evil side of life. Other nature imagery is present in these and other of Hawthorne's stories of isolation. [MHM] 4499. Liebman, Sheldon W. "Moral Choice in 'The Maypole of Merry Mount,'" SSF, 11 (Spring, 1974), 173-80. Edgar and Edith must make a moral choice between paganism and Christianity which are represented by the fantasy and illusion of the Merry Mounters and the lives of work and prayer of the Puritans. The couple must choose to leave the inno cence of childhood for the understanding and sympathy with mankind that comes with maturity. [MHM] 4500 Magretta, Joan. "The Coverdale Translation: Blithedale and the Bible," NHJ, (1974), 250-56. While Hawthorne is recognized as a writer in the Christian tradition, no study has been made of the Bibli cal elements in The Blithedale Romance. The work begins with the origins of old Moodie (Genesis), there are several allusions to Eden, the literary form of the parable is used, and so forth. And the narra tor bears the name of the translator of the Bible into English. [MHM] 4501 Marino, Rev. Bert G. "Melville and the Perfectionist Dilemma: A Study of Melville's Early 'Religious Thought," DA, 35 (December, 1974), 3690-A (Fordham). Melville's first five books, Typee, Omoo, Mardi, Redburn, and White-Jacket reveal his preoccupation with the evangelical perfectionist movement, based not on a systematic theology or an organized body of beliefs but on the original injunction of Christ that men should be "perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect." With out completely disowning the idealistic goals of perfectionism, Melville increasingly becomes aware of the dilemma between Christ's teaching and the subversion of that vision by human institutions.

The tale is read ironically not as an affirmation of Puritan rebellion, but as subtle criticism of "the violence and rebellion inherent in Puritanism." The clash between the British and the Puritan Americans is both political and religious, and Hawthorne supports neither side. Even the gray champion is symbolically connected with the beheading of Charles I. [MHM] 4504 Peattie, Roger W. "Swinburne's Funeral," N&amp;Q, 21 (December, •1974), 466-69.

"Rossetti's My Sister's Sleep, 13-16," Expl, 35 (Winter, 1976), 29-30. D. G.

Rather than being a parable of slavery, "Benito Cereno" is an "allegory of man's desperate isolation in a world where...'God is dead."' Filled with allusions to the Virgin Mary, the story presents a dual message of "the New World's incapacity to regenerate man" and the "emptiness of Christian religiosity." [MHM] 4507 Schwartz, Thoirias D. "Bayard Taylor's The Prophet: Mormonism as Literary TabooBYTJS, 14 (Winter, 1974), 235-47. Much to his later discomfort, Taylor in this poetic tragedy broke what appears to have been a serious literary taboo among America's greatest writers, of consciously avoiding Mormonism as a subject. The play was not well received by critics, and Taylor later denounced any connection between David Starr, the main character, and Joseph Smith. 4508 Stanton, Michael N. "The Startled Muse: Emerson and Science Fiction," Extrap, 16 (December, 1974), 64-66. Isaac Asimov's story "Nightfall" is inspired by a passage from Emerson's "Nature" in which the stars and the universe they light are symbolic—would man be jolted from his habit, he would acknowledge both the might and glory of his creator and his own place in the cosmos. 4509 Werge, Thomas. "Thomas Shepard and Crevecoeur: Two Uses of the Bosom Serpent before Hawthorne," NHJ (1974), 236-39. Sargent Bush, Jr. mentioned several possible sources for Hawthorne's story, but he failed to mention Crevecoeur and the Puritan theologian Thomas Shepard. Shepard, like Hawthorne, has snakes within man symbolize the pervasiveness of sin in man's life.

Hawthorne held that religion needed "a new revelation," and in his writings he pur sued the possibility of sexual love providing this by serving as a "redemptive force for a fallen world." However, love does not always triumph. Even Hester finally views sexual love as destructive without the sanction of the church. [MHM] 4511 Woodell, Charles Harold. "The Preacher in Nineteenth-Century Southern Fiction," DA, 35 (December, 1974), 3707-A (Chapel Hill: U. of N. Carolina). Five different preacher characters exist in nine teenth-century Southern fiction: the preacher in Southern romance, usually Episcopalian, espousing the simple dictates of devotion to God and love of one's neighbor; the idiosyncratic Southern preacher of Southern local color fiction; the despicable preacher—hypocrite, liar, thief—created by the Southwest humorist; the preacher in the propaganda novel supporting proslavery sentiment and the code of white supremacy; and the preacher character aware of guilt and failure in the human personality. Capable of suffering, failure, and self-sacri fice, this last type is a tribute to the growth of Southern literature. [SPM] TWENTIETH CENTURY 4512 Adams, Laura.

Western readers of native American literature must divest themselves of Judaeo-Christian conceptions of God and the uni verse to understand the symbols and forms of this literature. "Because of the basic assumption of the wholeness or unity of the universe, our natural and necessary relationship to all life is evident; all phenom ena wo witness, within or 'outside' ourselves are, like us, intelligent manifestations of the intelligent Universe from which they arise as do all things of earth and the cosmos beyond." The two basic forms of native American literature are Ceremony and Myth. Ceremony, which ritually enacts the "socialized perception of cosmic relationships" has as its purpose the integration of individuals, community and worlds. Myth is a prose record of the cosmic relationships. [JE] . 4514 Atlee, A. F. Michael.

"Of Man's Last Disobedience: Zamiatin's We and Orwell's .1984." CLS, 10 (December, 1973), 285-301. The dys topian novels We and 1984 reenact the Christian myth of man's first disobedience. "The claims of utopianism are essentially religious Bibliography / 53</page><page sequence="14">ones." Thus, in each dystopian novel a god figure, the embodiment of the State, requires absolute adoration and obedience; an Adam like protagonist defies this god by asserting his instinctual freedom in loving an Eve and "falls" from the new Eden. The fall of Zamiatin in We and of Winston in 1984 is incomplete, however, because in each case the State intervenes and "rehabilitates" the new Adam. Twentieth century futuristic Adam's disobedience is man's last disobedience; there will be no more Adams and no more Eves in Utopia. [SPM] 4516 Birbalsingh, F.M. "Edgar Mittelholzer: Moralist or Porno grapher?", JCL, 7 (July, 1969), 88-103. Mittelholzer's 23 novels have three major themes (social reform, sexual love, and tran scendentalism) and two minor ones (West Indian nationalism and colour-^ consciousness). However, his indignant and fierce adoption of an amoral universe ruled only by brute force paradoxically confirms .the exact opposite of Mittelholzer's aims in his novels —they end up asserting morality, not denying it, because of his powerfully consist . tent portrayal of the anarchic consequences of his point of view. [P^SG] 4517 Birbalsingh, F.M. "Mordecai Richler and the Jewish-Canadian Novel," JCL, 7 (June, 1972), 72-82. Whereas most Jewish-Canadiäti writers are limited by their blinkered concern with Judaism, Richler.'-s prophetic portrayal of its Canadian weaknesses enables him to be Jewish and Canadian in. a balanced way. He grows in maturity and sophistication through his first five novels, but his work falls short of the standards of the Jewish-American novel because he works within an ethos which inhibits creativity. He is, however, as good a novelist as any in the Commonwealth. [PSG] 4518 Birbalsinger, Frank. "The Tension of His Time," CanL, 64 (Spring1, 1975), 75-82.

"Visionary Literature and Finnegans Wake." DA, 35 (December, 1974), 3724-A (U. of Calif.). The mystic's ultimate goal is to transcend known realities. The visionary's goal is to transform known realities. Finnegans Wake as a visionary work functions to discover and strengthen prior visions, those of Giambat tista Vico and William Blake, by renewing and reinterpreting their symbolism. By incorporating prophecy and rhetoric into its narrative structure, it aims to make accessible to society a rediscovered and awakened vision, dormant in the shared poetic symbolism.

As he grows in understanding, Hurtle Duffield approaches the position taken by Jewish-Christian philosopher Simone Weil—that one should, look beyond oneself, in an emptiness open to and in waiting for wha.t she calls grace, some power that seizes us, so that we begin to liye. on a new level of intensity that fulfills our profoundest desires. Once so purified, Duffield realizes that life's value is what is achieved in the spirit, through, but also in defiance of, the body. The God who is the ground of this state, whom we can know only by shattering our illusion of self-sufficiency and realizing ourselves, is not an enemy of human dignity but its ultimate guarantor.

Atwood's Surfacing is a novel which portrays the self's journey "in relation to cosmic power or powers." The quest of the protagonist exemplifies a form of women's religious experience as mystical identi fication with nature. In seeing the processes of human life and death as part of the natural cycle, hence sacred, the novel reverses Christi anity's spiritualizing of birth and death. "Her novel suggests that spiritual insight surfaces through attention to the body, and that the achievement of authentic selfhood and power depends on understand ingrone's grounding in nature and natural energies."

Satirizing the philosophies of various unbelievers and tracing what he considers their combined effect, Mallock dramatizes his religious dilemma: with out orthodox Christian beliefs in a personal God, a future life would be reduced to absurdity; however, Christianity, if judged by scientific standards, seems untenable in a scientific world as do various substi tutes such as worship of a purely materialistic universe, the religion of man, rational Christianity, or the aesthetic view of life and religion. 4526 Dubiel, Richard Michael.

Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, The Old Man and the. Sea, and A Farewell to Arms "shed light on Till notion of meaninglessness as the central problem of man" and offer a "con crete aesthetic objectification of the central aspects of Paul Tillich's thought" in his sermons, The Courage to Be, and in the Systematics. They reflect Tillich's boundary situation, a state in which man sees the world from-'éstrangement; religious situation, a state of ontological polarities: individualization-participation, dynamics-form, freedom-destiny; the Eter nal Now; appreciation of the passion of life yet the need to order this passion; and the necessity to fulfill life in the face of meaninglessness. 4527, Eberhart, Richard. "Robert Frost in the Clearing," SoR, 11 (April, 1975), 260-68. Although Frost's later poetry seemingly reflects lasphemous outpourings, properly these are the playful "fooling around Bibliography / 55</page><page sequence="16">with ideas" of a poet dedicated to reason rather than to any relig ious system.

Endgame offers the most sustained portrayal of Beckett's religious sensibility; the play is an allegory which can be understood if it is seen that Clov is Christ, Hamm is man, and the end of the game is the end of Christianity. This analy sis of the play divides the allegory into "discrete events": (1) open ing events: introducing Christ and Man; (2) the eventual story; (3) the central event: the Anti-Christ, the Second Coming, and the Apocalypse—"What is ending is the world, the world of Christianity. It ends when the relationship between man and Christ ends"; (4) con cluding events: the relinquishment of Christ. Allusions to Yeats' "The Second Coming" underscore and illuminate the apocalpytic allusions. [JE] 4529 Egudu, R. "Defence of Culture in the Poetry of Christopher Okigbo," ALT, 6 (1973)y 14-25. Four themes dominate Okigbu's work: (1) sorrow at the loss of indigenous religion and culture (which he sees as one) as a result 'of imperialism, (2) a consequent anti-Catholicism, (3) a desire to see a revival of indigenous relig ion, and (4) his struggle to establish himself and be accepted as a poet. [PSG] 4530 Fletcher, Mary Dell. "William Faulkner: The Calvinistic Sensi bility," DA, 35 (February, 1975), 5400-A (Louisiana State U. and Agricultural and Mechanical College). Images, allusions, and analogues demonstrating moral attitudes rooted in-Calvinism shape Faulkner's fiction, especially The Sound and the Fury, Sanctuary, and Light in August. Specifically, the idea of "election" influences the belief in white supremacy, an inflexibility in morals, and an almost fanatical emphasis on respectability. Although systematic references to the Fall are absent, Faulkner's entire vision suggests that man is fallen, that women, viewed through men's eyes, are born with an affin ity for evil and, like Eve, are instruments in man's fäll. Characters often seem to function allegorically as pure evil or innocence. Al though Faulkner's acceptance of the Calvinist's concept of man's nature and condition is qualified, the concept does provide a major impetus in his fiction. [SPM] 4531 Gillespie, Robert.

Existential elements are revealed in Unamuno's Abel Sanchez and Hesse's Demain through the story of Cain and Abel.

The publication of The Second Scroll, an allegorical novel, in 1951, clarifies the picture of Klein's development into a trichotomy of Pentateuchal parallels—the ancient tribulations of the Jewish people, their modern re-enactments in Germany and Israel, and the spiritual Odyssey of Klein himself (who returns to his Jewish heritage after a brief flirtation with Marxism and materialism), Klein, however, no longer sees his Jewish heritage as Unique, but only as one way of stating some universal truths.

Ngubiah is one of the few African writers who unambig uously supports Christian-and modernizing values (which he seems to' identify with each other) as against tribal values. [PSG] 4555 Vazquez, Francisco. "El Transfondo Filosofico en la Poesia de Antonia Machado," EstLit, 569-70 (August 1-15, 1975), 12-15. There is a vital and doctrinal identification of Machado with Henri Bergson, and probably with Jose Luis Hidalgo and Blas de Otero. All have an individualistic and existential'struggle with God. 4556 Williams, Lloyd. "Religion and Life in James Ngugi's The River Between," ALT, 5 (1971), 54-65. There are parallels between the novel and the positions of Paul Tillich and Amos Wilder. Ngugi is aware of how meaningful faith in Christ can be for Kenya's Gikuyus, but maintains that it can only be relevant as it grows out of their own life situation, not as it is imposed upon them by the white man. By the end of the novel, the river becomes a symbol of the unity of the tribe with a meaningful faith. [PSG] 4557 Wurster, Grace Stewart. "Albee's Festival Chant: Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" Mich A, 9 (Spring, 1976), 61-67. While the play contains significant references to archetypal fertility rituals, there are allusions to Christianity. George suggests St. George, and Nick is-a term for the devil. In resisting George's killing of their sons Martha contrasts with the Biblical Martha who believed that Christ could raise persons from death". [MHM] 4558 Zuleta, Ignacid M. "La Nueva Poesia de Borges," EstLit, 576 (November 15, 1975), 4-7. The last poems of Borges depict his vision of the universe, reflections on old age, the inevitable echo of death, and the hope of contemplating God. *4481 Shenk, Robert. "John Bunyan: Puritan or Pilgrim?" Cithara,'14 (December, 1974), 77-93. Bunyan's pilgrim moves, acts, and re sponds "to significant events in a contingent and vital world. . . . This is the traditional spirit of a pilgrimage, and ,it is this parti cular kind of activity which distinguishes Bunyan's Christian from the Puritan." [RS] Bibliography / 60</page></plain_text>
