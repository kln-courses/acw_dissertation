EUR 85,0o.1 "Otherspeak" - famously for Isidore of Seville {Allegoria est alieniloquium) - is the figure of speech whereby one thing is said and another meant, and, as a fun- damental process it crowns medieval thought and culture, especially works of art. One thinks of Horace's "ship of state" (meaning the Republic) or of Vir- gil's bucolic Tityrus ( Eclogues , III). In theological terms, the exegetical process recalls the Pauline reference ( Quae sunt per allegoriam dicta - Galatians 4, 24) where the literal takes on both a spiritual meaning and also a more literary prac- tice inherited from antiquity. Continuous metaphors result, arising either from a) the Bible's book of Revelation (or Apocalypse ), which can manifest two levels of reality, or from b) the worldly sphere and are thus related to the human imagination. This handsome publication repre- sents the proceedings of a 2010 RILMA colloquium at the French National In- stitute for the History of Art (INHA), sponsored by the French University In- stitute, under the auspices of the inter- disciplinary research center at the Uni- versity of Lille (IRHIS, Institut de re- cherches Historiques du Septentrion). The effort represents part of a larger re- search project: "Iconographie Cycles as a Network of Knowledge and Encyclo- pedic Space in Medieval Books" ( Les Cycles iconographiques comme réseau du savoir et espace encyclopédique dans le livre du Moyen Age). Both historians of exegesis and of literature were invited to analyze the es-</page><page sequence="2">224 Mediaevistik 25 • 2012 sentials: definitions, meanings, muta- tions and functions of allegory in medie- val art, as they were manifested from the early Middle Ages down to the sixteenth century. The approach embraced this enormous subject with papers on Byz- antine sources, illuminated manuscripts, altarpieces, tapestries, seals, treatises on spirituality, literary and juridical texts, from bestiaries to music, from magic to princely emblems - all with the aim of expanding the horizons of the major themes in medieval iconography. The volume, a tribute to and mostly by art historians, contains these twenty- four articles in French (four in English), and the presentation is divided into six categories. Christian Heck, L'Allégorie dans l'art médiéval : Entre l'exégèse visuelle et la rhétorique de l'image. Pp. 7-19: featuring explications of fourteen black and white illustrations, i.e., manuscript illuminations from the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries, Heck's introduc- tion first recalls a 2008 colloquium that dealt with captioned images or the inclu- sion of a brief text on the illuminated page. Generic typology and allegory is the subject of the present volume, and a third conference on religious and pro- fane themes was scheduled for May 2011. 1. Formes , richesses et enjeux de l'allégorie. Gilbert Dahan, Les Usages de l'allégorie dans l'exégèse médiévale de la Bible : Exégèse monastique, exé- gèse universitaire. Pp. 25-35: defines terms first (e.g., figura , signum , sym- bole ), then analyzes a fascinating thir- teenth-century gloss on Genesis 22, where the sacrifice of Isaac is taken as a préfiguration of the Crucifixion ( Nota hic quomodo Christi est prefigurata in immolatione Ysaac [...]). Armand Stru- bel, L'Allégorie en littérature: une fa- talité? Pp. 37-48: cites, not surprisingly, the Romance of the Rose (Strubel's spe- ciality) on nearly every page, and incor- rectly as the "inaugurating work" (p. 39; much to be said about allegory in prece- dent vernacular works, even Chrétien de Troyes). But it is true that the heyday happens in the thirteenth through fif- teenth centuries, with works like the Pèlerinage de Vie Humaine and Ovide moralisé , for example, not to mention the profusion of allegorical iconography. Herbert L. Kessler, The Eloquence of Silver : More on the Allegorization of Matter. Pp. 49-64: begins with Old Tes- tament allegorical references to the pre- cious metal, casting light on twelve il- lustrations (printed here) that refer to manuscript mentions or to direct repre- sentations of the "unstable" metal (from tarnishing). 2. Entre l'église et l'Église. Peter Kurmann, L'Allégorie de la Jérusalem céleste et le dessin architectural à l'é- poque du gothique rayonnant. Pp. 67- 77: argues that the concept of placing figures like the prophets or saints in Gothic-era stained-glass (high choir windows in particular) allegorizes a su- per-terrestrial Jerusalem "of the beyond" (p. 75), and was introduced in the early fourteenth century by Jean Roussel, ab- bot of Saint-Ouen (Rouen). Daniel Russo, Allégorie , analogie , paradigme. Étude sur la peinture de l'Église domini- caine par Andrea di Bonaiuto, à Flor- ence, 1365/1367. Pp. 79-94: comments on eight illustrations from the Florentine</page><page sequence="3">Mediaevistik 25 • 2012 225 church of Santa Maria Novella, dating from the mid-fourteenth century. The frescoes reveal allegorical interpreta- tions of, for example, philosophy, con- templation, arithmetic, music, etc., in an attempt to provide a "visual proof of the [...Dominican] order's historical authen- ticity" (93). Cécile Voyer, L'Allégorie de la Synagogue , une représentation am- bivalente du judaïsme. Pp. 95-109: scru- tinizes ten illuminations showing Syna- goga (many in which she is blind- folded), representing typologically, in liturgical manuscripts in any case, and in moralized Bibles, Time or at least a bib- lical era. Alternately, in commentaries, she is the Enemy. Brigitte D'Hainaut- Zveny, L'Interprétation allégorique du rituel de la messe . Raisons , modalités d'action et efficacités. Pp. 111-123: ex- amines three illustrations dealing with late medieval aspects of the Mass such as the celebrant's gestures, the devotions and meditation of the participants - all empathetic and leading to the Imitatio Christi. Alfred Acres, What Happens When Christ Sleeps ? Pp. 125-1 37: looks at eight depictions of a slumbering Christ (inspired by Biblical scenes) that superficially link the images to death, but more than that, the Christ figure asleep remains in control of the situa- tion, "like a workshop of reflection within his life and beyond" (p. 135). 3. Entre sacré et profane. Jacqueline Leclercq-Marx, L'Illustration du Phy- siologus grec et latin , entre littéralité et réinterprétation de l'allégorie textuelle. Le cas des manuscrits Bruxellensis 10.066-77 et Smyrneus B.8. Pp. 141- 155: focuses on ten ancient allegorical and cyclical portrayals of animals found in the two captioned manuscripts (tenth- eleventh centuries), arguing for their great originality and for the probable in- fluence of the Greek manuscript (Smyrna) on the Latin (Brussels). Rémy Cordonnier, L'Illustration du Bestiaire (Xf - XIIIe siècle). Identité allégorique et allégorie identitaire. Pp. 157-170: ea- gles, foxes, goats, lions, crocodiles, among other animals, are found, in me- dieval bestiaries, to have both a zoologi- cal and an ethological connotation, in addition to their literary definition. With Biblical reference, their allegorical manifestation has a literal meaning as well as a hermeneutical significance. Catherine Jolivet-Lévy, Formes et fonc- tions de l'allégorie dans l'art médio- byzantin. Pp. 171-189: deals with thir- teen illustrations of imperial victories and portraits of power in the ninth through thirteenth centuries. Arising from antiquity, allegorical encomiastic iconography reveals personifications, metaphors, and virtuous likenesses. Co- lum Hourihane, Judge or Judged, Notes on The Dog in The Medieval Passion. Pp. 191-202: draws on the iconography of eleven representations that show dogs as noble and saintly, faithful, decorative, and anthropomorphic - but also, am- biguously, as impure, "personifying envy" (p. 192). In the Passion Sequence, the animal appears as an anti-Semitic tormentor of Christ and associated with judgment {Ecce homo. . .). 4. Typologies, parallèles, comparai- sons : Marc Gil, L'Art sigillaire se prê-te- t-il à la production d'images allégori- ques? Pp. 205-222: examines twenty- one illustrations (two manuscript illumi- nations as comparanda , nine seals),</page><page sequence="4">226 Mediaevistik 25 • 2012 principally sigillary art from the thir- teenth and fourteenth century (one from late antiquity, for comparison). Hinting at the benefits of negative research, Gil concludes that allegorical representation in signet rings is "too complex for this use" (p. 218). Maria Alessandra Bilotta, Formes et fonctions de l'allégorie dans l'illustration des manuscrits juridiques au XIVe siècle : Quelques observations en partant des exemples italiens. Pp. 223-240: Justice as an allegorical theme is studied in ten (nine Italian, one French) representations from the sixth- century Justinian Code and later. Ale- jandro García Avilés, The Philosopher and the Magician. On some medieval Allegories of Magic. Pp. 241-252: com- ments on ten illustrations in which im- ages of a philosopher and a magician are equated, suggesting an early medieval link between paganism and idolatry. But, under Aristotelian influence, natural magic (especially the study of "hidden properties of nature"-p. 250) neverthe- less became legitimized in the thirteenth century. Martine Clouzot, Les Allégories de la musique dans les livres peints (XIe - XVe siècle): mouvements , musicalités et temporalités d'une herméneutique . Pp. 253-270: evokes the images of Or- pheus, Pythagoras, the Muses, King David and Jubal. Five images relative to musical depictions of allegory are ana- lyzed (instruments or psalters), although new musical allegories appear beginning around 1200 whereby nature and time are allegorized. 5. Allégories et créations littéraires : Julia Drobinsky, L'Amour dans l'arbre et l'Amour au cœur ouvert Deux allégories sous influence visuelle dans les manu- scrits de Guillaume de Machaut. Pp. 273-287: ten illustrations occupy the author, six from Machauťs Dit du Ver- gier and Voir Dit. The two effective al- legorical images noted are that of Love perched in a tree and Love showing an open (sometimes bloody) heart. Anne- Marie Barbier, Dessein avoué et inten- tions voilées dans les représentations allégoriques de l'Épistre Othea de Christine de Pizan. Pp. 289-303: eleven illustrations, principally from manus- cripts of one of Christine's works ( L'Epistre Othea , ca, 1400), serve to il- luminate Othea as a personification of prudence and temperance, while mythological figures (Hector = strength, Minos = justice) call to mind familiar interpretations as seen in the Ovide mor- alisé. 6. La Fin du Moyen Âge: un temps de l'allégorie?: Laurent Hablot, Em- blématique et discours allégorique à la fin du Moyen Âge. Pp. 307-319: draws on the author's forthcoming monograph that studies emblems and motto devices in their allegorical context. Like her- aldry, emblems and devices (seen here in three illustrations) were often semi- ological metaphors for the princely vir- tues and his government. Rose-Marie Ferré, Des effets littéraires à la création monumentale: "Dire et voir autrement" la mort de soi. Le tombeau de corps du roi René à la cathédrale d'Angers. Pp. 321-330: Saint-Maurice, the Angers ca- thedral where the Angevine dynasty es- tablished its necropole, is scrutinized in these pages that illustrate seven images showing princely funerary monuments. King René's tomb imagery reveals an allegorical discourse on death. Pascale</page><page sequence="5">Mediaevistik 25 • 2012 227 Charron, Les Arts libérala dans la tapisserie à la fin du Moyen Âge: Entre iconographie savante et pratiques d'atelier. Pp. 331-334: the Middle Ages organized knowledge according to the seven liberal arts (i.e., the trivium , grammar, rhetoric, and logic, and the quadrivium , mathematics, geometry, music, and astronomy). They are repre- sented allegorically and analyzed here in eleven illustrations (mainly tapestries and wall paintings dating from the four- teenth and fifteenth centuries). Hervé Boëdec, Allégorie et spiritualité monas- tique au début du XV f siècle: Le Tripty- que du Bain mystique de Jean Belle- gambe. Pp. 345-370: examines in full detail (with comparando from eleven other illustrations) a sixteenth-century panel triptych by Jean Bellegambe (1480-1535/36) of the "mystic bath," which arose within a tradition of Chris- tological allegory: presented synopti- cally, from the crucified body the pre- cious blood that flows from five wounds into a fountain became, exegetically, a bath of piety. Boëdec concludes : "Dans la tradition monastique, l'amour des im- ages comme celui des Lettres, est avant tout l'expression du désir de Dieu" (p. 362). Antonella Fenech Kroke, Conti- nuité ou rupture? Le Langage de la per- sonnification dans les arts à l'aube des Temps Modernes. Pp. 371-386: personi- fication allegory, as an aspect of alle- gory, represents a human that incarnates an abstract quality or entity (p. 371), and is reviewed here in ten illustrations (nine from the fifteenth century, one, the last, from the sixteenth). The author eluci- dates the details of an early modern painting by Vasari (Pazienza, 1552) to argue for a "slow transmutation" (p. 383) - not necessarily continuity or rupture - of allegorical form and con- tent. Authors' bios follow (pp. 387-393); and the extensive general index (36 pp.) includes references to the illustrations (though there is no separate list of them). With the generous references in the endnotes of each contribition, this is an incredibly rich source for further study.
