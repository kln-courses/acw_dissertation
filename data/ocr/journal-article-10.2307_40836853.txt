<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Ton continent est noir": Rethinking Feminist Metaphors in Ananda Devi's Pagli Julia Waters A n her influential studies on the fraught relationship between Western academia and ~S "Third World" women's writing, G. C. Spivak famously identifies two predominant but opposing reading approaches: the first takes an interest only in those texts which its sees, homogenizingly, as representative of marginality, whilst the second seeks to read non- Western texts according to (inappropriate) Western criteria and theoretical models.1 The publishing history and reception of the works of Mauritian-born, francophone writer Ananda Devi are strikingly illustrative of the first of these tendencies. For many years, her novels and short stories were rejected by the large French publishing houses because they did not consciously signal their minority status and "difference."2 When eventually, in 2001, Devi's sixth novel, Pagli, was accepted by Gallimard, it was included within the separate "Continents noirs" series, dedicated to francophone literature from Africa and its diaspora, and thus classified as distinct from mainstream French collections. Indeed, the "Continents noirs" series has received much negative criticism for its perceived "ghettoization" of African francophone texts and for the disturbing essentialism of its packaging and title (see Loupias). Given the problems of essentialist classification and marginalization that Devi's work has come up against, I should like to argue that there may nonetheless be strategic benefits to be obtained from reading it within a Western theoretical framework. Running counter to the tendency to marginalize francophone works, an approach which reads them on the same terms as French texts could facilitate their insertion into mainstream French literature. Devi's novel Pagli seems to offer particularly fertile ground for a French feminist reading.3 Whilst many of the texts produced by metropolitan women writers of the 1990s continue, as in past generations, to be concerned with female experience, the female body and sexuality, these subjects tend to be approached with an irony and bluntness of style that are at odds with the celebratory lycricism and revolutionary optimism of their predecessors.4 Devi's work stands out, both thematically and stylistically, in contrast to such writings: her texts constantly rework, in extreme, allegorical form, thematics of gender relations and the specificity of female experience. The lyrical, metaphorical style of her female-centred narratives, with their frequent disruptions of grammar and syntax, echo many of the concerns and stylistic practices of exponents of "écriture féminine." 1 . See in particular Spivak 1 98 1 and 1 993. 2. According to Le Clézio, Gallimard turned down one of Devi's manuscripts that he had championed because Gallimard thought that it was "not exotic enough." According to Devi, Flammarion rejected her first novel because of its "absence de couleur locale et la noirceur du thème" (unpublished e-mail interview with Julia Waters, 7 Mav 2002). 3. I adopt the term "French feminism" throughout this article to denote feminist theoretical approaches which, following the ground-breaking work of Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva and Hélène Cixous during the 1970s, are broadly concerned with psychoanalytic ideas of female difference and of women's bodily, pre-cedipal relation to language. In using this term, I echo Moi's famous caveat that "the terms 'Anglo-American' and 'French' must not be taken to represent purely national demarcations: they do not signal the critics' birthplace but the intellectual tradition within which they work" (Moi xiv). 4. In their introduction to Women 's Writing in Contemporary France, Rye and Worton note that many contemporary French women writers "want to tell, to say, rather than to describe or embellish, hence the sparseness of the discourse of writers such as Angot or Escalle" (12). Dalhousie French Studies 68 (2004) -45-</page><page sequence="2">46 Julia Waters In an initial, strategic move, I therefore propose to examine those elements of Pagli which most fruitfully invite a feminist theoretical reading: the links established between femininity and madness, the portrayal of a woman's bodily relationship to language and writing, its image-laden, non-syntactical style, and the elaboration of an alternative, Utopian model of gender relations. In so doing, I shall draw in particular on the theoretical writings of Hélène Cixous, from whose ground-breaking essay, "Le rire de la Méduse," the quotation in this article's title is taken. In this essay, Cixous famously reworks Freud's metaphor of woman as a "dark continent," showing how women have traditionally internalized male-imposed, negative representations of their feminine nature: On peut leur apprendre [aux femmes] [...] que leur région est noire : parce que tu es Afrique, tu es noire. Ton continent est noir. Le noir est dangeureux. [...] Et l'horreur du noir, nous l'avons intériorisée. (41) In response, Cixous exhorts women to reappropriate and reverse the connotations of such a metaphor, and to draw strength from the fact that, as she puts it, "nous sommes * noires' et nous sommes belles" (41). Whilst Cixous' s reformulation of the Freudian metaphor is pertinent in feminist and psychoanalytic terms, her conflation of feminine difference with blackness has problematic implications for an application to the lives or literary works of non-Caucasian women. It is alarming then that, in 2000, Gallimard should use the very same metaphor, "Continents noirs"-redolent of Conrad's portrayal of Africa as a "Heart of Darkness" as well as of Freud's gendered terminology-as the title of its new series of works by francophone, African writers. It is on account of just such cultural insensitivity and u neon textual i zed theorizing that Spivak has repeatedly criticized French feminism's universal claims to speak for all women.5 She argues that Western feminists' concentration on sexual difference leads them to overlook other forms of difference-of ethnicity, language, class, religion, and so forth-that exist between women. Without constant consideration of one's own position as reading subject in relation to the object of reading, Spivak warns, "a deliberate application of the doctrines of French High 'Feminism' to a different situation of political specificity might misfire" (1981:164). In her important study of francophone women writers (including Devi), Françoise Lionnet echoes Spivak when she observes that [t]he experience of academic feminist criticism since the 1970s has created almost insurmountable differences between "Western" modes of analysis of the concrete status of women in various non- Western cultures on the one hand, and non- Western women's subjective experience of their own position on the other. (I)6 Highlighting the various conflicts within feminism, she goes on to argue, crucially, that in such a climate, it has become imperative to reexamine the ground from which such conflicts develop and to try to modulate and nuance the conceptual frameworks that generate these oppositions. (1) In the second part of my study, I propose to heed Spivak' s and Lionnet' s warnings and to explore areas of Devi's novel-its cultural and geographic context, its linguistic heteroglossia and its allusions to non-Western literary traditions-which complicate a universalizing, Western feminist reading. Rather than arguing that a French feminist approach is perforce inappropriate for the analysis of non- Western women's texts, I wish instead to consider how such a Western-based theory can be modulated and enriched 5. See, in particular, Spivak's ( 1 98 1 ) criticism of Julia Kristeva's Des Chinoises. 6. The second chapter of Lionnet' s book, "Evading the Subject: Narration and the City in Ananda Devi's Rue la Poudrière" (48-68), remains one of the few sustained analyses of the author's fictional practice.</page><page sequence="3">Ananda Devi 47 through contact with other forms of difference. This two-stage approach-first, of reading Pagli within a Western theoretical frame and then, secondly, of reconsidering this theoretical frame in relation to the non-Western specificities of the novel-offers one answer to Lionnet's call for a "truly comparative feminist criticism" (1). In terms of both its style and its thematic content, Devi's Pagli provides particularly fruitful material for an exploration of the applicability and the limits of a French feminist reading. It is a rich, lyrical and disturbing text, told mostly in the form of a first-person, stream-of-consciousness interior monologue by the central female figure, Daya. Raped at the age of thirteen by her cousin, she goes through with an arranged marriage to him in order to exact her revenge. Refusing to fulfil the conventional roles of wife, mother and housekeeper, she withholds her violated body as a defiant threat to her husband's authority. Daya' s association with social outcasts-the prostitute, Mitsy, and a beggarwoman-and her affair with Zii, a Creole fisherman, lead to her being ostracized by her family and society, branded as mad and locked in a chicken-shed. Yet her relationship with Zii also leads to Daya' s sexual and psychological liberation and to her self- affirmation as a desiring woman. Paradoxically, Daya' s physical incarceration and silencing free her imagination to express her newfound identity and tell her story. As its title highlights-'Tagli" is Mauritian Creole for "folle"-, the notions of madness and femininity are central to Devi's novel. In his seminal study, Folie et déraison, Michel Foucault argues that, throughout history, definitions of madness have been inextricably connected to those of "reason." Behaviour which transgresses society's norms of what is "rational" or "reasonable" is de facto defined as mad and, as such, is suppressed, either through rehabilitation or through ostracism and incarceration. Foucault' s depiction of madness as a construct, used to silence the irrational or unreasonable, was highly influential in French feminist theories of a "feminine" language. Echoing Foucault, Hélène Cixous argues that "[p]resque toute l'histoire de l'écriture se confond avec l'histoire de la raison dont elle est à la fois l'effet, le soutien, et un des alibis privilégiés" (42). By extension, since women have traditionally been silenced and excluded from phallocentric discourse, they possess a different relation to language and to its adjunct, reason. A truly "feminine" form of language, Cixous argues, is one which speaks through the body rather than the mind, disrupting male-imposed rules of logic, syntax and "reason." The following exchange between the "mofines," the enforcers of society's laws, and Daya highlights the opposing views of madness at the heart of Devi's novel: Tu es frappée de la pire des folies, m'ont-elles dit. Celle de l'aveuglement volontaire, celle de l'obstination, celle de la destruction. Mais non, ai-je ri. Je suis frappée de la folie de l'amour. (44) The "mofines" judge Daya' s conduct as mad in negative terms, since its effects or "symptoms" are seen to be unreasonable, illogical and anti-social by the essentially patriarchal society whose systems they uphold. Daya, on the other hand, does not deny her "madness" but sees it positively in terms of its cause-love-and of its effects on her as an individual and as a woman. Daya' s perceived "unreason" is a direct result of her refusal to conform to the traditional female roles of wife, mother and home-keeper. She makes explicit her defiance of male and societal authority by subverting the marriage ritual, the legal and religious construct by which, traditionally, a woman becomes a man's property. During the wedding ceremony, Daya reappropriates both the ritualized acts and the very text of its law, pronouncing her own defiant anti-vows:</page><page sequence="4">48 Julia Waters Le pandit m'a dit de prononcer le serment de fidélité et d'obéissance de la femme au mari : je devais promettre de m' occuper de lui, de le servir, de le garder en bonne santé et de lui donner beaucoup d'enfants. [. . .] Mais en versant le riz dans le feu, tête levée bien droite, je me suis mise à prononcer mes propres vœux : [...] J'aurai toujours le courage de dire non. Je garderai en mémoire le souvenir de ma douleur. Je regarderai cet homme droit dans les yeux avec la certitude de ma haine. Je ne rejoindrai pas le chemin tracé de femme d'épouse de mère de belle-mère. (74-75) Whereas Daya's cousin had desacralized their marriage in advance by raping her when she was a teenager, Daya, in turn, desacralizes it by appropriating the tools of language to undermine its terms. Unable to resist society's laws, which promised her to her cousin, she gains revenge by means of subversion, waiting until the moment when her more "feminine" tools will have maximum effect. Just when, according to patriarchal tradition, the man's authority over the woman is symbolically affirmed, as he takes possession of his new wife, Daya's words and actions effectively emasculate her husband. In his and society's view, as Daya states, "[j]e n'étais plus seulement différente. J'étais devenue dangereuse" (26). Having publicly humiliated her husband during the wedding ceremony, Daya then privately defies him in the marital bedroom on their wedding night. Standing naked in front of him, she menacingly refuses him the possession of her body that, by societal law, is now his right. This scene, as Daya flaunts her sexuality as an enticement and as a weapon in front of her trembling husband, and chants the following, incantatory threat, is a powerful symbol of an oppressed woman's reappropriation of her own body: Regarde ce corps que tu ne toucheras plus jamais. Regarde ce qui t'est à présent interdit. Regarde ce dont tu vas rêver pour le restant de tes jours et qui ne t'appartiendra pas. Regarde ce ventre qui ne portera pas d'enfant de toi. (77-78) Daya's assertion of her difference from the conventional women that her husband "croyait connaître" (78) and her refusal to fulfil the roles of lover and mother that society ascribes to a wife are combined here with her powerfully poetic, repetitive control of language, to assert the dangerous potential that her unsuppressed femininity represents. On another occasion, Daya again violates the sanctity of the social institution of marriage by re-enacting the wedding ceremony with a beggarwoman whom she invites into her husband's house. Dressing the beggarwoman in her own wedding sari, she mockingly usurps the traditional place of the husband, taking on his role as she places a "tikka" on the pseudo-bride's forehead. Whilst her family-in-law is doubly scandalized by Daya's disruption of a religious ritual and her literal and symbolic sullying of their home by inviting in the beggarwoman, Daya herself revels in her satirical flouting of societal and cultural laws. Daya's "different" and "dangerous" behaviour finally leads to her being branded as "pagli" and locked in a chicken-shed, when her family-in-law discovers her adulterous affair with Zil-the ultimate act of defiance of her husband's and society's authority. Daya defiantly assumes the label of "madwoman" and, by reversing the negativity traditionally associated with it, defiantly claims her new identity: "Une pagli, une folle, oui, pourquoi pas ? Ils m'ont donné ce nom et je le prends, puisque je le suis" (13). Daya's self- assertive appropriation of an externally imposed label recalls feminist theoretical reworkings of traditionally derogatory metaphors of femininity, such as Cixous's</page><page sequence="5">Ananda Devi 49 laughing Medusa or her rallying cry of "Nous sommes noires et nous sommes belles," discussed above. As if embodying theories of "feminine" language as one which expresses that which has been silenced by masculine discourse, it is during, and even due to, her incarceration that Daya/Pagli is able fully to explore, in her imagination, the creative potential of her "amour fou" and her newly-awakened female desire. Placed beyond the constraints of "la grande poigne parentale-conjugale-phallogocentrique," as Cixous describes it (40), Daya's physical incarceration paradoxically frees her mind to explore the creativity of her "unreason" and to tell her story. This creative liberation remains, however, an internal and personal one, at odds with her physical incarceration and silencing. Apart from occasional defiant outbursts, she is granted expression only through the material artifice of the novel, rather than at the level of its diegesis. In line with a key precept of French feminist theory, a strong metaphorical link is developed, throughout Pag li, between a woman's writing and the specificity of her anatomy. The old woman who raised Daya taught her that a woman's life is inscribed in her body and dictated by the suffering of menstruation and childbirth: "Et je voyais sur son visage cet océan de souffrance et je me demandais à quoi cela servait d'être née femme si votre destin s'écrivait en lettres de sang" (29). Through her sexual self- discovery with Zii, however, Daya experiences the positive potential of her female body and revels in the creative and disruptive power of imagined childbirth. Rather than continuing to view a woman's destiny negatively as being written by her body, Daya harnesses the positive, transgressive potential of writing (through) her body and female experience. The threat that such self-expression poses to "reason" is highlighted in Daya's self-reflexive description of "l'écriture dense et dangereuse de ce livre" (29), a description which echoes that of her own "dangerous" nature. The link between expression and the body is woven into a network of blood-related imagery, encompassing both positive and negative aspects of female experience: menstruation, childbirth, rape, abortion, and miscarriage. Female blood becomes closely associated with the red of the soil and hence with Daya's muddying of society's rigid order. As her wedding sari drags in the red mud, for instance, the trail that this leaves on the clean floors of her husband's house comes to symbolize Daya's subversive and self-expressive, feminine imprint. The artificial order and cleanliness of the "maison de sucre glace"7 extend, through a network of associated imagery, to the man-made, social structures of the entire village. A linguistic and symbolic opposition is created between the natural substance of the red mud or soil-"terre rouge"-and the social construction, in capitalized form, of the village-Terre Rouge. The natural origins of the village's name have, like its female inhabitants, been suppressed and sanitized. Indeed, the soil is strikingly described in anthropomorphic terms as "cette terre rouge et violée" (154), so drawing a very clear parallel between its exploitation and that of women. It is only through the central female character's disruption of society's pristine and artificial surface that the unruly, natural elements can break through. This disruption of masculine order and reason by the "feminine" is symbolized elsewhere by recurrent, interrelated "natural" motifs of cracks and fissures, cyclones and seismic upheaval, so echoing Cixous' s description of feminine language as one which "ne peut pas ne pas être subversif : s'il s'écrit, c'est en soulevant, volcanique, la vieille croûte immobilière, porteuse des investissements masculins" (49). The thematic association of the female body with natural manifestations of "unreason" is matched, on a stylistic level, by Devi's use of long, climactic sentences, disrupted chronology, and broken syntax. The 7. Daya first uses this ironic term to describe her husband's house in the second chapter, itself called "Sucre glace/Gato lamarye": "J'ai la chance d'habiter une maison en béton peinte comme un gâteau de mariage en rose et en blanc. Je la déteste dès le premier regard et la vue de ce sucre glace, de ce gato lamarye, me poigne le cœur" (23).</page><page sequence="6">50 Julia Waters chapter entitled "Zii," which takes the form of a long, interior monologue addressed by Daya to her lover in his absence, is introduced with the following words: "Zii. Je ne peux t' écrire que comme un poème sans rime et sans ponctuation parce que tu dépasses tout cela..." (83). Replicating Daya' s expression of her boundless, unrestrai nable desire and the discovery of her body's capacity for pleasure, the entire chapter is made up of a single, stream-of-consciousness sentence, without punctuation. Just as Daya' s adulterous and passionate "amour fou" for Zii goes beyond social norms of reason, so too does her writing style exceed the accepted, phallocentric rules of grammar and syntax. This inscription, in the written language, of Daya' s uninhibited voice and of her body's natural rhythms and emotions, seems again to echo Cixous's evocation of a quintessential^ feminine form of writing: Dans la parole féminine comme dans l'écriture ne cesse jamais de résonner ce qui de nous avoir jadis traversé, touché imperceptiblement, profondément, garde le pouvoir de nous affecter, le chant, la première musique, celle de la première voix d'amour, que toute femme préserve vivante. Comment ce rapport privilégié à la voix ? Parce qu'aucune femme n'empile autant de défenses anti- pulsionnelles qu'un homme. (44) Devi's novel depicts an archetypically patriarchal society which self-defensively works to suppress the threat posed by the central female character's voice and "song." Drawing inspiration from her bodily experiences, Daya' s voice finds expression in her sustained resistance to such suppression, and in her Utopian but doomed dream of egalitarian love with Zii. Although, according to Cixous, the nature of women's bodies, psyche and experience means that they are more likely to be able to practice a truly "feminine," anti- phallogocentric form of writing, her own theories do not categorize "écriture féminine" as necessarily gender-specific. Indeed, her elaboration of a "feminine" form of writing is only part of a broader preoccupation with a theory of a "feminine libidinal economy," that is, an encounter with otherness based not on gain, but on altruistic generosity. In Pagli, the relationship between Daya and Zii seems to offer such an alternative, Utopian model of relationality, in which traditional gender associations are destroyed. Whereas Daya is, throughout the narrative, predominantly associated with the red of the soil, Zii is inextricably linked with the vast, liberating expanse of the sea: "[L] 'odeur de la mer est partout en toi et autour de toi" (38). The traditional gender associations of femininity both with maternity and with the sea, much exploited by French feminists in the word-play of "mer/mère," are thus attributed most consistently to the main male character. In contrast to Daya' s anger, Zii is portrayed as nurturing and maternal. Daya discovers her body, her jouissance and even her femininity through Zii, whose unselfish generosity-a characteristic seen as intrinsically feminine by many feminist theorists-teaches her the unrestrained reciprocity of mutual love. Cixous's theory of a feminine libidinal economy, based on the altruism of the gift (le don), is thus embodied in the male character, Zii, whose "capacité à donner" (40), in turn, teaches Daya about her own capacity for self- dissolution and openness to otherness. So far, my reading has shown how a broadly French feminist approach to Pagli can be useful in elucidating the gendered nature of the novel's thematics and style, and has sketched some lines for further research. Devi's highly lyrical, image-laden writing, reminiscent of exponents of "écriture féminine," fruitfully invites such a theoretical approach. Indeed, since Devi writes in French and now publishes in France for a largely metropolitan French audience, one might even see this as a very conscious, strategic invitation. Reading Devi's non-Western, francophone novel within an established Western theoretical framework has allowed me to avoid the prevalent tendency to classify</page><page sequence="7">Ananda Devi 5 1 such works as "marginal," and so to subvert from within the ghettoization and essentialist paratextual framing of Gallimard' s "Continents noirs" series. Yet, in adopting such an approach, I have been consciously overlooking other areas of difference than the purely sexual, which, as I hope now to show in the second stage of my "comparative feminist" approach, both complicate and enrich a Western feminist reading. In interviews, Devi has repeatedly warned against over-literal, representational readings of her works.8 Daya's story has broader, symbolic and allegorical resonance than as a realist portrayal of the plight of Indo-Mauritian women. Nonetheless, the cultural, geographic and linguistic context for the elaboration of this story is sustainedly, though unstatedly, non-Western. Devi's work is steeped in Hindu and Indian culture, although, as she says: si le lecteur ne perçoit pas ces références, je ne pense pas que ce soit d'une importance capitale. [...] Mais s'il éprouve l'envie d'accomplir cette exploration, elle peut lui offrir une autre façon d'appréhender le texte. (2001b) Another way of looking at Devi's novel might begin with a reconsideration of the links between femininity and madness, explored above. As Foucault argues, "madness" has no fixed or universal definition, but is characterized as that which is excluded from the social construct of "reason." If the notion of "madness" is socially and culturally relative, would knowledge of the values and beliefs of the Hindu society, within which Devi's novel is set, not help us better to understand why Daya's behaviour is perceived as "mad"? As we have already discussed, Daya's defiant subversion of the marriage ceremony is seen by this society as evidence of her dangerous "madness." Whilst a Western reader can clearly grasp the general, subversive and scandalous impact of Daya's actions, her refusal to comply to the Hindu law of "good wifely behaviour" and her rebuttal of the sanctity of a Hindu ritual contribute to her being branded not simply as "transgressive" or "different," but as "mad." Knowledge of the symbolism of the Hindu marriage rituals, attire and vows would enrich an understanding of the significance of Daya's systematic disruption or destruction of each of these. Devi does not offer the Western reader an explanation of the significance of Daya's red sari and veil, that she later tears off and throws into a crumpled heap, of the gold jewellery that she breaks, of the garlands of flowers that she feels to be full of thorns, of the petals that she tramples underfoot, or of the "tikka" that she wipes off her forehead. Although a Western reader can appreciate the fear that causes the pandit's and bridegroom's hands to shake, the cultural or religious implications of their dropping "ghee" and rice on the floor during the vows are left unstated. Daya's defiant anti-vows are given, first, in Creole and, only secondly, in French translation. Only a Mauritian creolophone reader would be party to Daya's actual words and would, therefore, know their tone and linguistic or cultural impact. Indeed, Devi herself has indicated in an interview that Western readers are not the principal, intended audience of this passage: [A]u moment du serment de manage, dans Pagli, ce texte en créole est intentionnellement choquant pour les personnes d'origine indienne à Maurice parce qu'il rejette tout de ce rituel et de ce serment.9 Her quotation also implicitly suggests that the French translation may not be entirely faithful to the power of the original, Creole version, so excluding metropolitan readers from some of its meanings. 8. For instance, Devi states that "ce que je raconte n'est pas nécessairement représentatif de toute la société mauricienne, [...] je prends un cas particulier et le pousse à l'extrême pour aboutir à quelque chose d'universel" (unpublished e-mail interview with Julia Waters, 7 May 2002). 9. Unpublished e-mail interview with Julia Waters, 24 May 2002.</page><page sequence="8">52 Julia Waters Indian culture and Hindu beliefs-such as reincarnation, karma, metamorphosis, and predestination-form the pervasive, non-Western basis of Pagli's setting, narrative structure, and general philosophical underpinnings. A French feminist approach could see the novel's cyclical structure as emblematic of "écriture féminine," in its inscription of a female body's rhythms and cycles. Yet, at both the beginning and the end of Devi's novel, there are strong intimations of the Hindu belief in reincarnation, as Daya projects herself into the future, beyond her imminent death, with such phrases as "je pourrais revenir," "si je reviens" and "je reviendrai pour démembrer leurs mensonges" (14). In this last example, an implicit reference is also made to the notion of karma: human beings will be punished in future lives for the sins of the present. References to the notions of reincarnation and karma explain, in part, the tone of ambivalent hope in the apparently apocalyptic ending. The destruction of the present society of Terre Rouge and of Daya herself is portrayed as bringing about the possibility of regeneration and rebirth, according to new, egalitarian models of existence. Devi's novel can thus be seen not only to disrupt patriarchy and to propose a "feminine libidinal economy" in its place, but also to critique certain founding tenets of Hinduism. Daya' s rejection of the law of good wifely conduct is matched by her refusal to accept the notion of predestination in the old woman's words about women's fate. When Daya invites the beggarwoman into her husband's house, or forms relationships with Mitsy and Zii, such actions are not only an affront to patriarchal authority or to bourgeois social norms, but also to the Hindu caste system. Indeed, Daya uses particularly culturally-laden word-play to describe her own perceived "madness": "[J] 'étais l'intouchable. Parce que touchée. Touchée par toi" (111). Whilst writing in the French language, Devi consistently has recourse to non-French, non-Judeo-Christian traditions and terms, to create her text's own internal network of meanings. Whereas Devi's non-linear, non-chronological style can be seen to embody a universally "feminine" form of writing, Devi herself has suggested that this may be due to the unconscious influence of the digressive structures of classic Indian literature (2001b). Read in relation to an Indian cultural context, the apocalyptic ending of Pag li, in which Daya is buried alive in a wall of mud for refusing to renounce Zii, could be seen as an intertextual reworking of the story of the legendary lovers, Anarkali and Saleem. When Prince Saleem refuses to leave his lower-caste lover, Anarkali, his father has her bricked up alive in a wall. A non- Western "comparative" reading of the scene in which Daya flaunts her naked body before her husband could also enrich a strictly French feminist approach. In the Mahabarata, the central female character, Draupadi, is lost by her eldest husband in a game of cards. When his rival claims his prize, he tries publicly to humiliate Draupadi by pulling off her sari, but the god Krishna miraculously intervenes to save her honor, clothing her in a never-ending sari (D. Krishna). The Bengali writer Mahasweta Devi has rewritten this myth within the context of Indian independence in her short story "Draupadi." When the eponymous heroine of Mahasweta Devi's transposed scene is raped and stripped, she refuses to be clothed. Like Daya in Pa gli, Mahasweta Devi's Draupadi/Dopdi defiantly exposes her violated body to the gaze of her male captors. Spivak has read this defiant revelation of the tortured and naked female body as a symbol of postcolonial, feminist resistance and agency.10 The parallels between Mahasweta Devi's and Ananda Devi's texts are striking and compellingly hint at a possible network of essentially non-Western intertextuality. The linguistic particularities of Pag IV s Mauritian context further complicate French feminist readings of the thematic and stylistic links between the female body and language. Approaches which focus solely on "feminine" disruptions of phallocentric language are problematized by the text's heteroglossia. French is not the mother tongue 10. See in particular Spivak's translation and reading of Mahasweta Devi's "Draupadi" (1987: 179-%).</page><page sequence="9">Ananda Devi 53 of either Devi or the fictional character, Daya, or, indeed, of the vast majority of Mauritians. Both French and English are official languages of education and administration, but Creole is the most common language (amongst many) of oral communication. Devi's own comments on the relationship between French and Creole indicate some of the linguistic particularities specific to her work's context: Le créole [...] est la langue la plus parlée à Maurice, notre langue maternelle dans la mesure où pour la plupart des Mauriciens, c'est la langue qu'ils apprennent en premier. Mais elle a longtemps été dénigrée comme un « patois », méprisée par rapport aux langues européennes et indiennes, et rejetée par les classes moyennes et bourgeoises au profit du français. (Unpublished e-mail interview with Julia Waters, 24 May 2002) A complex hierarchy of languages, linked to issues of class and ethnicity, exists in Mauritius, and is reflected in Devi's novel. Although Pagli is written predominantly in French, there are numerous places-the wedding vows, discussed above, being a prominent example-where Creole is introduced, so disrupting non-Creole-speaking readers' access to its meanings. The very title of the novel, key to its subject-matter, needs translation for a Western reader. Bi-lingual chapter headings hint at a cultural and linguistic reality beyond a metropolitan French reader's immediate field of understanding. Since French is the language of a former colonial power, there may be political motives besides solely feminist ones for an appropriative subversion of its grammar and syntax and for the linguistic exclusion of metropolitan readers. In her influential research, Spivak questions the ability of privileged, Western feminist theory to represent disenfranchized or "subaltern" women.11 Her own writings attempt to find an appropriate critical vocabulary for articulating the experiences of dispossessed people who, in reality, have no voice. Spivak contends that literature may be a suitable site for such an articulation. In this context, the telling of Daya's story, in Pagli, could be seen as the fictive articulation of a "subaltern" woman's voice. Like Spivak, Devi is acutely aware of her own ambivalent "outside/inside" position in relation to the female characters whom she portrays: unlike them, she is from a liberal, middle-class background, is highly educated, and has lived and worked abroad. In her fictional works, she does not thus speak as a subaltern woman, but for her. Most of Daya's story, in Pagli, is told in highly poetic, literary French. Given the novel's almost consistent first-person narrative, the literary artifice of this appropriation of a (colonial) Western language endows its silenced, subaltern narrator with an empowering, non-realist voice with which to address her Western audience. When, in contrast, Daya speaks, as it were, in her own voice to other characters in the novel, she does so in Creole, a language that is not immediately comprehensible to a Western reader. These intermittent gaps in comprehension are, in postcolonial feminist terms, politically subversive. The frequent lack of translation of Daya's words, like the lack of explanation of Hindu customs and cultural references, are the textual reflection of the subaltern's voice and agency, as she resists being fully represented in Western terms. Daya's refusal to reveal all her meanings invites the Western reader to learn to speak in her voice and to gain a greater understanding of her culture. Western readers are encouraged to shift their own boundaries and to engage in a more active and reciprocal interaction with the otherness of the non-Western text. Spivak has repeatedly criticized Western feminism's claims to speak for all women. Yet Devi's epigraph to Pagli, "Tout roman est un acte d'amour," implicitly makes a similar claim for the universal applicability of her work, in its use of the inclusive article 1 1 . Amongst Spivak's many essays on this subject, see in particular Spivak 1985.</page><page sequence="10">54 Julia Waters "tout" and in its appeal to the universal emotion of love.12 Importantly, however, Devi's "everywoman," Daya, comes from a profoundly different world from that of the privileged, Western, feminist academics that Spivak criticizes, and so shifts the grounds for debates on the nature of "woman." Devi's novel invites a reading that precludes the unmodified application of either of the two prevalent approaches to non- Western texts, identified by Spivak, that is, to read them either, homogenizingly, as representative of marginality or from within a Western theoretical frame and according to Western criteria. Whilst Pagli is not, in any sense, a realist representation of Mauritian society, the island's multi-ethnic, multilingual, postcolonial culture provides, "de l'intérieur,"13 the context for the elaboration of the "universal" significance of Daya' s story. The frequent, unsignalled shifts between realist and fantastic elements, between the referential and the allegorical, with no attempt to explain, contextualize or frame them, confound attempts to categorize Devi's writing practice. Her hybrid novel continues to explore universal issues of female experience, engaging in a mutually enriching exchange with French feminist theory. Yet its fundamentally non-Western, non-Judeo-Christian context and network of cultural allusions force us as Western readers, as Spivak exhorts, to reconsider our own position as reading subjects and to modify the cultural assumptions underlying our own approaches. By opening ourselves to the enriching possibilities of true dialogue, we may finally learn to listen to, rather than speak for, "other" women. University of Bath WORKS CITED Cixous, Hélène.

For instance: "[M]y novels are anchored in Mauritian reality [...] but my purpose is to extract from [this] the universal aspects common to the whole of humanity" (interview with Danielle Chavy Cooper, 16 January, 1989; cited in Lionnet 49); "Les événements partent de considérations réelles [...] mais sont poussés à un extrême qui a surtout une valeur symbolique et universelle" (unpublished e-mail interview with Julia Waters, 7 May 2002). 13. Devi puts many of the problems in her novels' reception down to the fact that "j'écrivais mon pays de l'intérieur, et pas pour l'expliquer à des lecteurs étrangers" (unpublished e-mail interview with Julia Waters, 7 May 2002).</page><page sequence="11">Ananda Devi 55 . 1987. in Other Worlds: Essays in Cultural Politics.
