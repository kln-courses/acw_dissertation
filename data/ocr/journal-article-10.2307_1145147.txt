<plain_text><page sequence="1">Except for Carnival, Bumba-meu- Boi, one of the most complex manifesta- tions of Brazilian popular theatre, is the only festival that is still held throughout all Brazil. It is both a procession and a dramatic performance; its basic theme concerns the death and resurrection of an ox. Given the central theme of the Ox, it would appear that Bumba-meu- Boi should occur only in basically pas- toral areas; however, it is performed in mining, fishing, and agricultural areas as well. It occurs during the "King's Day," between Christmas and January 6, and during the Festas Juninas, the St. Anthony's Day, St. John's Day and St. Peter's Day celebrations, between June 13 and 29. In parts of Brazil where life is still relatively traditional and provincial, the Bumba-meu-Boi maintains its primary structure, main characters, and the ba- sic theme of the Ox. Secondary themes are added and modified according to the place, the historical background and the contemporary setting of the perfor- mance. This depends on the creative inspiration and the desires of the group that is performing. Typically, the scene of the Bumba- meu-Boi is a quiet provincial town with narrow streets and small, colored houses. The ordinary tranquil rhythm of life is interrupted by the invasion of a raucous colorful procession. Guitars, drums, flutes, tambourines, whistles, and other musical instruments play a special song announcing a remarkable happening. Children and adults run to their windows, applauding and scream- ing, "Eh! Bumba, Eh! Boi," greeting the group, recognizing its name embroi- dered on a flag that leads the proces- sion. The performers ask the public to be their audience, to be "in" their procession. First comes the Chorus, four or more persons, sometimes dressed like the colonial aristocracy, singing and dancing. Next come the rest of the characters, wearing improvised fantas- tic costumes, according to their role, and each dancing his particular charac- The Bumba-meu-Boi [Brazil] by Jose Possi Neto</page><page sequence="2">6 THE DRAMA REVIEW/T75 ter. People applaud them or jeer at those who are more aggressive or frightening. These characters commonly attack the audience, who either run from them or counterattack. This establishes a kind of game that is maintained throughout the procession, until the group arrives at a house (almost always that of important people of the village) where they enter and perform the play. In some places this second part of the Bumba-meu-Boi is called embaixada (embassy). These embassies also can take place in front of a church or in the main square of the town. Many performances may be presented during the course of the procession, or there may be one complete procession throughout the whole village announcing the performance. The play begins. The band is seated at one side of a large living room or kitchen. In the back two people hold tall sticks from which hangs a colored fabric, like a curtain, used by the performers to enter and leave the scene. Where there is room, some spectators enter, the rest remaining outside, peering through the open windows at the scene. The Chorus sings the "overture," usually songs specific to Bumba-meu-Boi, staying hidden behind the curtain to introduce the main characters. In the band are two important figures of the drama, the Violeiro and Cantador, who play guitars and improvise new songs referring to community life and to what is happening during the performance. During the introduction, the Cavalo Marinho (sea horse) first appears-a man in a sea captain's costume. He wears a colored jacket with golden ornaments, pants with red stripes down the sides, a red satin ribbon across his chest, and a paper crown with mirrors and ribbons. He carries a sword and enters riding a horse. This is a skirt-like attachment that consists of a wicker structure covered by colored fabric, attached at the waist. The front of the structure is in the form of a horse's head. He dances. He is the "white one," the rich farmer who owns the Ox, all the other animals, the lands, and the cowboys. Then the Chorus introduces the Vaqueiros (cowboys), men wearing regional leather clothes. They serve and obey the Cavalo Marinho. Among the cowboys are Mateus and Birico. (In the north of Brazil, Mateus is named Pai Francisco and Birico Sebastiao.) They both have whips. Mateus has many bells hanging from his clothes, and Birico sometimes wears a mask. They are both main characters, performing all the time. They are irreverent; like clowns, they discuss and joke, dancing and tap-dancing. They joke about the characters who represent the important people, the power, the establishment-Cavalo Marinho, the Doctor, the Priest, and Capitao do Mato (police). Accompanying them is Catirina, Mateus' partner and mistress. She is also a comic character, performed by a transvestite man. (Traditionally the female characters were played by men; today women can be found in some Bumba-meu-Boi performances, but this is characteristic only of groups that perform near the big cities.) She is an exaggerated caricature of an amusing and provocative black woman. She dances a frenetic samba (the most popular Brazilian dance). Sometimes with Catirina comes Dona Joana, a secondary female character also performed by a transvestite man. She is also black, decorated with a lot of kitsch ornaments. They relate directly to the audience, creating many comic situations. At a certain point, Catirina, appearing pregnant, expresses the desire to eat an ox's tongue. Without it, she believes her baby may be born with a crooked mouth (a popular peasant superstition). So Mateus and Birico go off in search of an ox. In their travels, they meet a lot of strange figures, secondary characters, that are presented in terms of the mythology and social conditions of the different places where Bumba-</page><page sequence="3">meu-Boi occurs. Each one has specific music and costume. For example, they may encounter one or another of the following characters: Burrinha or Zabelinha (donkey)-a woman riding a donkey that does a fast tap-dance; almost always a transvestite man. Gigante (giant)-a man wearing a mask made from a calabash, painted with big eyes, big mouth and big nose, wearing makeup that is reminiscent of a Mexican anthropomorphic idol or a Marajoaran idol (from Marajo Island, north of Brazil). He wears a large cotton wig and rides a horse like that of Cavalo Marinho. He dances like a giant, with very difficult acrobatic movements. His music is something like death screams and forest sounds. Caboclinha-an Indian girl wearing a costume made of feathers and riding a goat (a mythic character from Caapora-Amerindian my- thology). Dismounting from the goat, she kills it with an arrow. Ema (exotic bird)-a boy weighted down by a straw basket full of trash; he moves like a bird. Babau-a dreadful animal. A man under a sheet clicking together the jaws of a horse. Cazumba-also called Folharao. A witch covered with green leaves and a horrifying mask. Cunha-Cazumba's partner. A transvestite man wearing ragged clothes and a dirty tousled wig. Mateus and Birico, after encountering many of these characters, finally find the Ox. The Ox is usually one or two men under a wicker structure, similar to that of Cavalo Marinho. This structure, which serves as the Ox's body, is covered either by</page><page sequence="4">colored fabric or embroidered velvet (similar to a bullfighter's costume). The head is an ox skull or mask, adorned with flowers, stars and ribbons. The Ox enters dancing, while the spectators sing with the Chorus and applaud enthusiastically. This is the climax of the play. The Ox dances a Lundu, a traditional tap-dance; the music is a type of primitive samba. He attacks the cowboys, the Chorus, and the audience. Mateus shoots the Ox; it dies. The Chorus and the audience mourn its death, singing a popular Brazilian song: My Ox has died What am I going to do? I will have to search for another Ox Far, in Piau,. (Piaui is a state in the north of Brazil.) Hearing the music, the Cavalo Marinho appears to see what has happened. He calls the Doctor to take care of the Ox. He summons the Capitao do Mato, an aggressive-man wearing a military uniform, to arrest the guilty ones. Sometimes they call in reinforcements, the Caboclos or Indios Guerreiros. These are secondary characters, wearing Amerindian costumes of feathers and small mirrors. They do a warlike Amerindian dance. The Priest enters to bless the Ox and attempts at the same time to marry Catirina and Mateus. They both place the Priest in ridiculous situations. (This character is ridiculed more than any of the others.) Mateus then cuts out the Ox's tongue and offers it to Catirina. The meat is distributed to the audience in a symbolic way-wine is offered, or handkerchiefs are given out, to be returned with money or gifts.</page><page sequence="5">The Doctor arrives, making a comic entrance. He says that the Ox has not died and prescribes an enema, accomplished by inserting a boy into the Ox's behind. Mateus and Birico are pressed into this service. They hunt for a boy in the audience and then perform the enema. The Ox stands up and starts dancing. The spectators become excited and begin to sing and dance. (Sometimes the resurrection occurs by touching the Ox's back with a sword or by offering presents and money to the Ox.) The Capitao do Mato enters tied up with the rope he brought to secure the guilty ones. The audience jeers excitedly. All the characters dance together while the Chorus sings the Farewell. This may be either polite, if the host and the audience have given the performers good money, food and drinks, or sarcastic and aggressive if their efforts have not been well rewarded. The Bumba-meu-Boi does not have a fixed text, so that new themes may be added through improvisation to the central one. Secondary scenes often appear as critiques of behavior and customs. The piece is traditionally full of satire about the doctors, the priests and the local authorities. All of them are subject to the audience's judgment. There is a great deal of audience participation: They sing with the Chorus; they recognize with pleasure and ap- plause the familiar characters. They become frightened and scream at the fantastic characters and animals. They react to violent actions. Even though they know the outcome of the drama, they get excited and involved with the specific improvisations. They admire the Ox's dance, they cry at its death, they become happy with the resurrec- tion. (Marlyse Meyer, Revue d'Histoire du Theatre)</page><page sequence="6">II i These are specific reactions from a particular audience that still lives a traditional Brazilian life, something close to the modus vivendi operating at the beginning of the nineteenth century. They live in cities, provincial towns or villages in the north and northeast, or in the interior in the center and south of Brazil. In contrast, a "modern" population exists that is characterized by "constant modification." This population, a complex and modern society, has institutionalized art forms, in which individual talent is stimulated by radio, television and movies. In this society, the communal and collective meaning of Bumba-meu-Boi gets lost. The improvisations begin to be reduced. The text becomes poor, and the critical functions disappear. The drama becomes linear and standardized. And, of course, it is impossi- ble to maintain the vital relationship between actors and audience. The audience becomes passive, because it no longer participates directly in the play. With the standardization of the performance, the characters become "exotic," distant from people's lives and problems. Bumba-meu-Boi loses its mythic meaning.
