What does this mean? How us to develop models of stylistic change beyond linear diffu can we distinguish indigenous stylistic change from that sion between dominant and subordinate regions, associated with the movement of people into the area, or less direct stylistic influence through trade and extended contact? These issues are raised by the scroll or Turkish slipper support Early Research (Fig. 1), a diagnostic element of the Early Postclassic ceram- In an early and thorough discussion of effigy feet across ics of western Belize and adjacent areas of the Peten (ca.

Wauchope concluded lapse (e.g., Willey et al. 1965:388). I argue here that scroll that effigy supports were linked to the spread of Mexican supports are not a sudden introduction from Yucatan, but a influence in the Terminal Classic, but he also suggested that stylization of a zoomorphic effigy foot tradition that can be effigy supports might have developed in Highland Guatemala 36 traced back to the Preclassic in the Peten and the adjacent or some other southern area, and were "brought home [to mexicon • Vol. XXVI • April 2004</page><page sequence="2">buff glosswares and elaborately modeled and incised black Balanza vessels ... to polished, slightly "waxy" redwares more suggestive of Preclassic technologies" (Brady et al. 1998: 31). Although Brady et al. place tapir-shaped supports late in their developmental sequence (late early Tzakol, i.e., ca. A.D. 150—420) they note " the precise appearance chro nology, duration, and extent of overlap of these distinctive modes remains undetermined" (Brady et al. 1998:28). They conclude that even if mammiform and tapir head supports are foreign, "they had already begun to appear throughout the lowlands by early in the Middle Preclassic period (900-400 B.C.)" (Brady et al. 1998:22). Adams (1971 :fig. 30c) found several supports of this tapir/ peccary/ manatee type from Aguila Orange: Aguila Variety vessels in Protoclassic Salinas complex contexts at Altar de Sacrificios. Early Classic The spatial and temporal distribution of similar zoomorphic head supports has not been further pursued, but they appear intermittently throughout the Classic Maya lowlands. A "pig's head" polychrome support from Uaxactun is dated to Early Classic Tzakol 2 (Smith 1955:fig. 71c, 9) (Fig. 2). An Early Classic vessel from Calakmul (Schmidt et al. 1998:fig. 257) has nearly identical supports but in this case they are incised not painted: "The four supports seem to represent tapir or peccary heads with the snout downward, which, in the latter case, could be symbols of the pillars of the cosmos at each cardinal point, or the constellation of Gemini for the ancient Fig. 1. Augustine Red scroll supports: a-i) Tipu; j-k) Baking Pot Maya" (Schmidt et al. 1998:583). A Balanza Black vessel support from Becan has the same "rounded-tapered or modi Central Mexico] by merchants and soldiers." Wauchope's fied truncated-conical" (Ball 1977:45, fig. 17d) shape as the explicative dilemma is common to those who have tried to other Early Classic vessels discussed above, but with neither explain the movement of related stylistic elements at this incising nor painting. A polychrome covered dish (unprov time.

The similarities of these Maya zoomorphic effigies to those of Nicoya Polychrome from the southeastern periphery is suggestive because Nicoya Polychrome may have been Late Preclassic and Protoclassic produced earlier than previously thought: The apparently sudden adoption of scroll feet in the Postclassic The "Mexicanization" of the southern Maya area that Fox is comparable to the introduction of mammiform supports in [1981].... documents for the 9th century and into the the Protoclassic.

The strongest evi others in the Belize Valley originally identified the mammi- dence for this comes from Andrews' (1976) workatQuelepa form support as part of an "intrusive" Floral Park sphere, in eastern El Salvador. He dates a major site-unit intrusion supposedly linked to migrations from El Salvador (100 B.C. of Veracruz artifacts and architecture to the Lepa phase, to A.D. 300). More recently, Brady et al.

At Late Classic-Termi nal Classic (Boca Complex) Altar de Sacrificios, anthropomorphic - effigy modeled supports occur on Zopilote Smudged Black (Adams 1971 :fig. 60 d) dishes with diag nostic notched flanges (Adams 1971 :fig. 60 b and c) that resemble contemporaneous McRae Impres sed vessels in the Belize Valley. In the Belize Valley, effigy supports with scroll-like bases also occur in Late Classic II (700-830) and Ter minal Classic (830-1000) contexts at Xunantunich (LeCount 1996: fig. E.29) (Fig. 4). Like the undec orated Balanza Black form from Becan, these Xunantunich supports appear to be transitional between effigies and the simpler scrol 1 form.

Early Classic (Tzakol 2) vessel supports, Uaxactun (Smith 1955:fig. 71c); comes from Barton Ramie (Willey no scale in original. et al 1965:fig. 248). Augustine Red is the earliest type in the Belize and Plumbate is unmistakable (e.g., in pyriform shapes and Valley that incorporates the true modeled scroll as a foot motifs see Lothrop 1926:XXXVIII, XLI), but the potentially mode, but there are a few rare variants that include effigy early dates of Nicoya Polychrome throw into question the features (Fig. 5). Both of the effigy-scroll examples from nature of timing of "Mexicanization" in the Maya area and its Barton Ramie resemble the Early Classic zoomorphic effigy periphery. Neff (1989:189) noted the similarity of San Juan scrolls discussed earlier. The scroll foot is also common in Plumbate to Tiquisate Ware: Paxcaman Red, a type that appears later than Augustine, but In this interpretation, both Plumbate and Tiquisate ware effigy features have never been found on Paxcaman Red traditions diverged from an earlier (Early-Middle Classic supports, suggesting that scroll feet were already fully devel period) Pacific Coast fine-paste tradition.

LXc); no scale in original Simple scroll feet, to my knowledge, do not appear on the Yucatan peninsula until the Hocaba phase (ca. A.D. 1200 1300) in Mayapan Red Ware (Mama Red) and in a variety of combination effigy-scroll forms (see especially Smith 1971: fig. 40 c 12, 18-20). An imported Papacal Incised (Mayapan Red Ware) flanged dish found at Barton Ramie has effigy scroll feet, and closely resembles Buk Phase ceramics at Lamanai (Northern Belize) dating from roughly A.D. 1050 to 1350 (Graham 1987:85-6) but the scroll foot is not noted at Lamanai itself until the Late Postclassic (Graham 1987:fig. 89n). In the Late Postclassic, solid effigy supports represent ing human heads and serpent heads are also found in Matillas Fine Orange (formerly V Fine orange) at Aguacatal (Matheny 1970:93; Smith 1958:157). Thus, present evidence suggests that scroll-shaped supports appear earliest in the southern lowlands, not in the northern lowlands as is commonly thought. In the Terminal Classic-Early Postclassic, the wide distribution of scroll supports indicates substantial inter regional interaction and suggests that this interaction was web-like and multi-directional rather than linear. Discussion Now that the idea that the scroll support was introduced from the north or northwest in the Terminal Classic-Early Post classic is untenable, and its distribution includes areas in the southeast periphery, we must consider models of a less linear type to explain the complex spatial and temporal distribution of this form. The parallel here to contemporary thought on the Protoclassic is instructive. Willey et al. (1965:342-349) originally considered Floral Park an "intrusive" Central American phenomenon that brought polychrome and distinc tive support forms including a "modified mammiform foot" modes such as the tapir head support. There was an eventual "amalgamation and total absorptive blending of the Floral Park ideas into a united Early Classic pattern" (Willey et al. 1965:351).Over time, Willey modified his ideas from foreign presence to foreign "influences" (Gifford 1976:327; Willey 1973a:38-9). Most recently, Floral Park has been reevaluated as "a thoroughly local, nonintrusive ceramic entity, other than to the extent that the polychrome glossware vessels (Dos Arroyos series) may reflect a contemporary manifestation of the long-lived lowland Maya tradition of exchanging finely decorated ceramic vessels as a form of social currency" (Brady et al. 1998:27). Schortman and Urban (1992:243) have suggested that cross-culturally, increased interregional elite interaction and the exchange of exotic-looking goods that signify social power, lead to the formation of "intersocietal elite identities." These identities can be considered a type of ethnicity or sociopolitical affiliation that cross barriers such as language and foster cooperation in the realms of, for example, politics and trade. These identities are symbolized by forms of visual communication that also cut across societal boundaries. Some sort of non-centralized stylistic diffusion like this seems to fit the data better than simple diffusion in this case. The spatial and temporal distribution of the scroll foot suggests that this form is an abstraction of an ancient Peten form that became suddenly popular in the Belize Valley along with a suite of changes in the Terminal Classic-Early Postclassic. Scroll feet are almost always found on finely made red dishes of Vitzil-Orange-Red Ware, especially those of the Augustine Group (Fig. 6). Vitzil Orange -Red Ware has a fine, intense orange-red paste that is very rare during most of the Classic, although this level of technical competence had been achieved by the Preclassic in Mars Orange Ware. Vitzil Orange-Red Ware ceramics are generally considered local imitations of Fine Orange Ware, and their concentration in the Belize Valley suggests that they were produced there. 0 2 cm 0 2 cm 0 2 cm 0 2 cm Fig. 4.

E.29). 39 Vol. XXVI • April 2004</page><page sequence="5">Fine Orange Ware includes some of the finest ceramics the Maya ever produced and was widely distributed and copied. The re-adoption of fine, bright orange pastes after centuries of absence in the Belize Valley ceramics repertoire was prob ably due to the desirability of Fine Orange Ware. The scroll foot is the logical three-dimensional equivalent to the two-dimensional scroll, and may represent the modifi cation of effigy feet in line with the increased use of two dimensional scroll patterns (for example, painted and in cised) on fine pottery generally in the Postclassic, as part of the increased elite interaction of the era (Rice 1989; Smith and Heath-Smith 1980). The simplification of anthropomorphic ceramic figurines over time in the northwest zone has been documented by Goldstein (1989), and this sort of "progres sive conventionalization" (Lothrop 1926:161) is common in the history of art. The scroll feet are often found on "chile grater" bowls that are found in the Preclassic in Central Mexico but are a Terminal Classic addition in the Belize Valley. The rapid Terminal Classic introduction of chile graters, the reintroduction of fine, bright orange pastes, and the association of both with scroll supports suggests a stylistic hybridization of local Belize Valley forms and techniques with more "international" ones after the collapse. What is the meaning of pottery that is produced in one place to look like it came from another? Foreign or " exotic" styles have generally carried connotations of sophistication in Western culture (Chinoiserie etc.). Pottery in a foreign style at least suggests that it is imported, and this connotes rarity and value even if its local origin is obvious. The presence of exotic elements on some of the highest-quality Postclassic Fig. 5. Effigy supports from Barton Ramie: a) Augustine Red (Willey Maya pottery supports this.

More generally, perhaps, foreign style signals that the user has a cosmopolitan outlook that extends beyond that of people who use pottery in local styles. If local styles can be said to reinforce boundaries on a regional scale (Demarest and Foias 1993:173), foreign styles signal open ness to the world at the local level. Pottery may have func tioned socioculturally any of these ways in the Postclassic Belize Valley after many of the other status markers of Classic Maya life (e.g., stelae and pyramids) no longer filled such roles. In the Belize Valley, evidence to date suggests that scroll supports are absent in the Late Classic, but they are a standard from found in most early Postclassic samples (e.g., at Tipu). I believe that striking Postclassic increase in scroll supports was related to the serpent motifs that form a horizon style or a stylistic lingua franca understood throughout most of Terminal Classic Mesoamerica, but with specific ties to Central Mexico through the Gulf Coast and Yucatan (Aimers 2003). The presence of these serpentine motifs on high quality pottery has been taken to mean that they expressed sociopolitical (Kepecs et al. 1994; Rice 1989,) and/or reli gious identity (Ringle et al. 1998). In any case, the scroll can been seen as an abstraction of an existing tradition in line with new pan-Mesoamerican motifs, and not simply the diffusion of a form from the north. The sudden popularity of scroll supports was spurred by the network of elite interaction occurring across Mesoamerica in the 800's and after, and shows that stylistic change may represent complex forms of differentiation and affiliation both within and among regions of Mesoamerica.

RESUMEN: Los soportes trípodes con los extremos en forma de voluta son el elemento más diagnóstico del repertorio cerámico del valle de Belice que se suma durante el período Postclásico. Se ha planteado que ese particular rasgo estilístico se originó en las florecientes Tierras Bajas del norte y se difundió, quizá a través de migraciones, hacia los territorios casi abandonados de los Maya del sur. Por el contrario, en este trabajo se puede mostrar que los soportes trípodes con los extremos en forma de voluta son una simplificación o abstracción de la tradición de soportes-efigie del Preclásico en el valle de Belice. Esto surge en conjunción con nuevas tendencias estilísticas pan-mesoamericanas, especialmente con el uso de los diseños en forma de voluta. Esta súbita popularidad de los soportes en forma de voluta en la cerámica fina representa una red de interacción a través de Mesoamérica posterior a A.D. 800, e indica que el cambio estilístico puede representar procesos de diferenciación social y de afiliación tanto dentro como entre las regiones de Mesoamérica. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Gefäße mit Füßen in Form von Schnecken oder Pantoffeln sind die wichtigste Ergänzung im keramischen Repertoire des Belize Valley in der Zeit der Postklassik. Als ihr Ursprung wird oft das nördliche Tiefland angenommen, von wo die „Pantoffelfüße" vielleicht in Folge von Bevölkerungsmigrationen in das bereits verlassene südliche Tiefland exportiert worden seien. Im vorliegenden Artikel wird der Ursprung der „Pantoffelfüße" aber auf die Abstrahierung und Vereinfachung von figürlichen Gefäßfüßen aus der Präklassik im Zusammenhang mit einem panmesoamerikanischen stilistischen Trend zur Verwendung von Voluten und Spiralen zurückgeführt. Die plötzliche Popularität von schneckenförigen Füßen bei feinen Keramikgefäßen repräsentiert ein ab 800 n. Chr. funktionierendes mesoamerikanisches Interaktionsnetzwerk. Es zeigt, dass Stilwandel den Prozess sozialer Differenzierung und Affiliation sowohl innerhalb wie auch zwischen den Regionen Mesoamerikas widerspiegeln kann.</page></plain_text>
