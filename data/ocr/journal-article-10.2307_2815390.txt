<plain_text><page sequence="1">WAYS OF MAMMALS in Fact and Fancy. By Clifford B. Moore. The Ronald Press Company, New York. $3.50. x:ii + 274 pp. 1953. Those who know are frequently both annoyed and ex- asperated by the gullibility of people in believing such hoary yarns as that bears suck their paws to sustain themselves in winter, that wolverines forcibly acceler- ate their gluttony by squeezing themselves between two saplings, or that the male opossum copulates with the female through her nose. This little book deals with these and many other ancient myths, exposing them for what they are, and in many cases disclosing their origin. By contrast many other facts, some just as in- credible, are amply justified by firsthand evidence. In the closing pages of the book the author has done what many of us have wished to do: come to grips with many popular misconceptions concerning mam- mals in general, among them the relationships between monkeys, apes and men, the anthropomorphic imputa- tion of human characteristics to animal behavior, and the belief in the wildest of impossible hybrid combina- tions. Finally, there is a philosophical comment on that peculiarly American phenomenon, the tall tale, and its place in relation to mendacious folklore. This is a fascinating little book, one that you will want to read more than once. BRYAN P. GLASS</page></plain_text>
