<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Romische Religionsgeschichte. By KURT LATTE. ("'Handbuch der Altertums- wissenschaft," V. Abt., 4. Teil.) Munich: Verlag C. H. Beck, 1960. Pp. xvi+430+6 folding charts+ 10 pls. In Muiller's Handbuch series Latte's book on Roman religion now replaces Wissowa's Religion und Kultus der Ramer2, which was for fifty years the stand-by of students of Roman religion. The time had come to write an entirely new book instead of patching up the old. Latte's book is excellent, a worthy successor to Wissowa's, and scholars can consult it with equal confidence. Although specialists may disa- gree on details, since much in Roman religion is still uncertain, I have found nothing to object to in Latte's exposition. We begin with the genuine Roman religion of early days, a religion of farmers who did military service. We learn about the religious practices and beliefs of farmers, householders, and city-state, and distinguish between original Roman cults and those which came to the city from Latium, Etruria, and the Osco-Umbrian peoples. This was the time of Aius Locutius and Salus Semonia, when every mani- festation of divinity was likely to be con- sidered a separate deity. In general the deities were powers, not exactly imperson- al, but not definitely conceived as com- plete persons of human shape or mind. Yet the first Romans worshiped Jupiter, the old Indo-European sky god, very much a fully realized person among the Romans' ancestors. The fact is that we do not know much about Roman religion before 500, since we do not have contemporary re- cords. Deities are necessarily given human characteristics; yet complete anthropo- morphism is probably a consequence of sculpture, the making of divine images in human form. Anthropomorphism in Rome seems to owe a great deal to Etruria. As for the term numen, this does not seem to belong to early Roman religion, but to be the Roman Stoics' translation of dynamis as a religious term. We see this native Roman religion gradually obscured by the Greek cults which began to penetrate Roman worship in the sixth century, although the old religion never disappeared. Not only did Greek gods enter the Roman pantheon, but Roman gods assumed Greek forms. Her- cules and Apollo came to Rome so early that they almost seem to be Roman gods. By the first century B.c. Roman religion had a definitely Greek complexion. Thereafter Greek cults receded before oriental deities. The Mother of the Gods, the Asiatic Kybele, came to Rome as early as 204 B.C.; not much over a century later Roman troops who had served in Asia Minor brought the Cappadocian Ma to Rome and called her Bellona. Soon came Isis with other Egyptian deities, then Syrian gods and Mithras, not to mention Judaism and Christianity. After A.D. 200 all cults tended to merge; syncretism became the fashion among pagans. Then Romans often ad- dressed deity with abstract terms such as Genius, Tutela, Fortuna, and in doing so showed themselves to be characteristically Roman, since their ancestors too had been disposed to conceive deity in terms of effects and powers rather than as defi- nitely conceived persons. Mithraism, Isis cult, taurobolium-these were not Roman religion, nor were the Greek cults. However much we may be devoted to Zeus and Apollo, we honor them as gods of the Greek states; however much we may prefer Hellenic religion to Roman, we prefer it for Hellas. In Roman religion we want the religion of Numa (a phrase that Latte does not use) and regret its 39</page><page sequence="2">40 BOOK REVIEWS decline before Hellenic and Asiatic forms. It was full of magic, tabu, superstition, ritualism-true enough, but it also had the Roman spirit within it. We can under- stand the feeling of Pater's Marius in his boyhood for the religion' of Numa. When Rome forgot the Roman gods, then it was that Rome declined and fell. Latte's book can give us an adequate conception of Roman religion and its history. It contains almost anything that one may want to know about it; it is not likely to let one down. Following its fourteen chapters are four Anhdnge con- cerned with offering and prayer, Roman priesthoods, the Argei, and a list of Roman temples with dates of foundation. Fol- lowing the index are six folded sheets presenting the twelve months of the Roman calendar; nine columns for each month present different sorts of in- formation about each day. This is in every respect a necessary book for the student of Roman religion. JOSEPH FONTENROSE University of California</page></plain_text>
