I n recalling his first encounter with the art of Max Ernst, in 192I, the poet Andre Breton wrote that the works "introduced an entirely orig- inal scheme of visual structure; yet they corresponded exactly to the intentions of Lautreamont and Rimbaud in poetry.... We were all filled immediately with unparalleled admiration. The external object had broken free from its normal environment, and its component parts had become emancipated from it in such a way as to maintain entirely new relationships with other elements in the collages." The emancipation of everyday objects from their conventional environments, and their placement in improbable contexts, undermines our abil- ity to "read" an artwork according to our preconceived notions about the world. Such unsettling imagery as Breton saw in Max Ernst's col- lages-unrelated to our conventional frames of reference and marked by elisions and fantasy frequently associated with poetry-would become a hallmark of the Surrealist movement. The period 1912-27, the years in which Ernst transformed his art from an early, expressionistic style of painting into a unique form of Dada and early Surrealism, is explored in the exhibition Max Ernst: Dada and the Dawn ofSurrealism, on view at the Museum through May 2. Created in an era of revolutionary changes in world view-an era in which Freud posited the existence of the unconscious and the impor- tance, and truth, of the dream, and in which Einstein proved that there is no absolute reality-Ernst's work expresses the enigma of the dream, the instability of our preconceptions about the world. Its imagery, sometimes amusing, sometimes discomfiting, often disturbing, continues tO fascinate and to evoke a variety of interpretations. Many of these are made from the standpoint of the culture in which the artist lived and worked, many according to what we know of Ernst's personal life. In the catalogue to Max Ernst: Dada and the Dawn of Surrealism, William A. Camfield offers a chronological account of Ernst's life and work. We have adapted Camfield's explorations of four of the artist's works from the years I9I9-I920. 7</page><page sequence="2">AA.rIp"e l'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' La canalisation de gazfingorifir [Canalisation ofRefrgerated Gas] ca. 1919 20.

Photo: Paul Hester, Houston. he composition of Ernst's Canalisation of Rfigerated Gas (ca. I9I9-i920) is dominated by circular forms-comprising bicycle wheels and two different types of roulette wheels-that Ernst stamped on the paper and then embellished with watercolor. Although under magnification it becomes clear that the artist not only stamped but drew several of the forms in the work-the spring- like form in the lower right and the organic elements in the four wheels on the left-he chose to conceal his hand as much as possible by making his own marks imitate the appearance of the stamped forms. As his father, who was an amateur painter, had done, Ernst attempted to match his model. But where the father strove to imitate the illusion of reality in respected figurative art, the son geared his hand to emulating commercial printing blocks and toyed with illu- sions of three dimensions. The imagery in this work, though composed of wheels, no longer suggests vehicles but human figures. On the left a smaller, essentially two-dimensional figure composed of four wheels bends as though recoiling from the towering three-dimensional figure on the right. Once these wheel constructions are perceived as anthropomorphic forms, the red and blue organic shape in one wheel on the left may be seen as a phallus, opening questions of identity and relationships. Is the relationship presented one of gender, of parent and child, of student-teacher? Is it specifically autobiographical or something more general? The images themselves are evocative but ambiguous, and if we turn to the title-inscription for illumination, no answer emerges, although it does refer to numbers, motion, and an anthro- pomorphic presence: The canalisation of refrigerated gas activates sputtering little num- bers / The compressed heartflees in time / we lean against the delphic poet. 8</page><page sequence="3">'' '-'--- I 1 {_ _ oIt .)*k;4 *t ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~eneatur \ . _ 6 _ ._, }[, . ~~~~~~~~umpPcIJntrI'r; , X ..~ . rest kd .pX * f4 t VA. tJ s~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~j ,m- .: 'i - e' v'~ e _ ~~~ // 7&lt;.

Purchase. he prominent theme which emerged from Ernst's stamped and rubbed drawings, such as Canalisation of Refrigerated Gas, was the anthropomorphic character of shapes composed of stacked- up, ready-made forms. Often, as in that work, these shapes had appeared as couples with gender relationships, and Ernst continued to deal with that theme in new works over the fall and winter of 1920. This continuity is clear in The Hat Makes the Man (I920), a collage made from images of hats that have been cut out of a cata- logue and reassembled with the addition of color, shading, and lines connecting the hats into tubular forms. Not surprisingly, psychoanalytic interpretations of The Hat Makes the Man have been offered, given Freud's concept of a hat on the head as a common phallic symbol and the phallic protuberance of the aggressive central figure in this composition. Critic Lucy Lippard was the first to suggest social and psychological references linked to conditions of the time and to the inscription in the lower right corner-"Seed-covered, stacked-up man, seedless waterformer [edelformer] well-fitting nervous system also tightly-fitted nerves (the hat makes the man, style is the tailor)": The hat covers the head; formally it resembles the cover of the head of the male organ; it is also a repressive factor, a cover-up, an overlay of "civilization"on the seat ofthe subconscious; one tipped ones hat (uncov- ered, bared oneself) briefly when sayinggood day when communicating with others, especially ladies. Dada's view ofEuropean man in I920 as a "stacked-up, "seedless" puppet or 'mannequin," repressed, oppressed, and manipulated by bourgeois capitalism, imprisoned in "tight-fitting nerve"- clothes, and much in need of uncovering, is one reference.* While granting the danger that exists from over-extending sexu- al references in Ernst's work, it should be recognized that the artist himself frequently included sexual terms and innuendos in his titles and inscriptions. Indeed, the anthropomorphic and sexual nature of this work extends through most of the representatives of their genre, though not always as clearly as in these examples. * Lucy Lippard, "Max Ernst: Passed and Pressing Tensions," The Hudson Review, vol. 23, no. 4, Winter 1970-7I, p. 706. 9</page><page sequence="4">Here Everything Is Still Floating.

Ernst's "Fatagagas" (Fabrication of Paintings Guaranteed Geomet- ric, or Fabrication de Tableaux Gasomitriques Garantis), an example of which is reproduced above, are primarily distin- guished by the collaborative process of their making. Over the win- ter of 1920-2I, four of these were made with Hans Arp, beginning around October-November I920, during one of Arp's visits to Cologne, where Ernst was living. With a few exceptions, the contri- butions by Arp and others with whom Ernst collaborated on the Fatagagas amounted to the titles and accompanying inscriptions or texts, while Ernst was responsible for the images. In a letter of November I920 to Tristan Tzara, Ernst wrote: Arp will be stayinga few more days in Cologne. Iam sendingyou the manuscripts and oeuvres which he wants to launch in Dadaglobe [Tzaras'proposedDada anthology].... Fa TaGaGa is the Fabrication de Tableaux Gasometriques Garantis which Arp and I have launched. Can you show the engraver how to hide the seams in the reproductions of the pastedpieces (so as to keep the Fatagaga secret a secret)?... ** Here Everything Is Still Floating (1920) is a Fatagaga collage, although close inspection is required to discern that the interior views of the fish and inverted beetle are separate elements, glued to a photographic ground. While the collage approaches the mysterious, seamless whole that Ernst asked Tzara to achieve in the publication of Dadaglobe, in a photographic enlargement of it Ernst achieved that goal himself. That particular advantage of photographic copies of collages led Ernst to value the photograph, not the collage, as the final work, and it is the photo enlargement that carried the Fatagaga text, an inscription on the paper mount above and below the image: everything is stillfloating here / it is notyet2 o'clock / no one was still thinking about the two ferdinis with theirflying hams and hats (still in top form!) here the armada is definitely defeatedfor the first time / the rainbow eater didn't know / the gut steamer and skeleton fish decided to take off ** Ernst letter to Tzara, undated (ca.

Collage: cut printed reproductions, gouache, and pencil on paper. 93/16 x 7". Private collection. References to the Holy Family in this untitled collage of 1920 may harbor biographical allusions. The composition is dominated by a well-dressed male adult, standing on a Chirico-like floor in a barren landscape and struggling with a giant serpent. This figure is accompanied by three additional dramatis personae: the head of a Raphaelesque woman in the immediate foreground, and in the far left background a father in nineteenth-century attire holding a young child aloft on his shoulder. Haloes around the heads of the woman and child identify them as the Madonna and Christ Child, suggest- ing the theme of the Holy Family and a reference perhaps to Ernst's own family, given the precedent of Ernst's father, Philipp, portraying young Max as the Christ Child. A view of the snake as a general sym- bol of the phallus - a common Freudian interpretation of snakes shifts the struggle from the framework of Ernst's family to a universal battle of libidinous impulses erupting against the social context of religion and bourgeois respectability. 0 0 0 Max Ernst: Dada and the Dawn of Surrealism was coordinatedfor The Museum OfModern Art by Kynaston McShine, Senior Curator, Department of Painting and Sculpture, and organized by Walter Hopps, Consulting Curator, and Susan Davidson, Associate Curator, Twentieth CenturyArt, The Menil Collection, Houston.
