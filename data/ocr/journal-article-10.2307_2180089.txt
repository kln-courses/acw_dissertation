Benrubi's two compendious volumes have been crowned by the Acade'mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques because they form a thorough and encyclopedic summary of the leading French philosophi- cal contributions of the last seventy-five years. Auguste Comte's posi-</page><page sequence="2">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 633 tivistic philosophy is taken as the initial point of reference in respect to which all later works are considered as either developments or re- actions. Prominent examples of the former (discussed under the group of empiricist-positivists) are Taine, Renan, Ribot, Durkheim, Levy- Bruhl. Those who have reacted against Comte's empiricist-positivism are divided into two groups: (a) critical idealists led by Renouvier and including such scientific critics as Claude Bernard, Poincare, Duhem, Meyerson, Goblot, as well as rationalists like Hamelin, Couturat, Rey- mond, Nicod, and Brunschvicg; (b) spiritualist-positivists inspired by the Leibnizian metaphysics of Maine de Biran: Ampere, Cousin, Janet, Guyau, Lalande, Bergson, the Bergsonians, the neo-Thomists, etc. Whereas the first current of empiricist-positivism seems to have caught all the leading historians, psychologists, and sociologists, the second stream of critical idealism (with its source in Kant) has given impetus to an epistemological analysis of the role of thought in the more exact sciences. It may seem strange on first reflection that the social scientists of France have shown less of the operations of thought than the critics of the exact physical sciences, but this may be ex- plained as due to the unsystematic character of social thought as com- pared with the more explicit and clearly defined structure of the physi- cal and mathematical sciences. M. Benrubis work will be invaluable as a bibliographical guide to the student of modern French philosophy, although it offers no critical evaluation of any of the major or minor writers, so that their works all appear to lie on the same intellectual level. Nor does he offer any defense of his implicit assumption that the salvation of French philoso- phy lies in a spiritualist-positivism, itself a very insecure and ill-defined position. For the critical discussion which is lacking in M. Benrubi's ency- clopedic account of contemporary French thought, we may consult the annual Recherches philosophiques whose second volume has now ap- peared. Its editorial policy is to invite critical articles from all schools and thus to stimulate "la philosophie en devenir". The six parts of this annual of philosophical research include recent trends in I. Meta- physics; II. Linguistics, Psychology and Pedagogy; III. Logic and Philosophy of the Sciences (only two articles, a short one on "Axi- omatic Method and Rigor", and a rather verbose one on "Modalities of Judgment"); V. Philosophy in Great Britain, Belgium, Poland, Ru- mania; VI. Bibliographical notices and reviews of books in the vari- ous branches of philosophy, especially in each of the periods of the history of philosophy. M. Janet's leading article on "La finalite en mathematiques" ap- plies very neatly to modern mathematics and physics a non-anthropo- morphic but organic conception of final cause which is really identified</page><page sequence="3">634 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW with the structure of functions having minimal and maximal limits. Most of the other articles deal with the notion of teleological system in biology and psychology. They manifest the groping for a modified mechanistic or organismic analysis of the older rigid mechanism and anthropomorphic vitalism. L. Verlaine's researches in Belgium on ani- mal psychology seem to establish, from a mechanistic standpoint, the view that in the behavior of insects and higher animals resort to gen- eral concepts operates prior to concern with particular details. John Laird's review of British philosophy contains his selection of notable British works from 1930 to 1932 as well as a critical judgment of the four he considers most important; namely, Stout's Mind and Matter, Price's Perception, Hallett's Aeternitas, and A. E. Taylor's Faith of a Moralist. The Polish school of mathematical logicians con- tinues to thrive under the leadership of J. Lukasiewicz (cf. Annals de la Societe des Sciences de Varsovie) and J. Lesniewske. The applica- tion of this discipline has led T. Kotarbinski to a "radical realism" (cf. 7th Congress of Philosophy held at Oxford) and M. Znamierowski to a rigorous analysis of social sciences (cf. Prolegomenes aux sciences politiques, Varsovie, I930). In Rumania, the main works that have ap- peared deal with aesthetics and the philosophy of civilization. The Recherches philosophiques like Benrubi's work contain invalu- able bibliographies of recent works. PHILIP PAUL WIENER COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK</page></plain_text>
