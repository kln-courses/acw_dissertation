<plain_text><page sequence="1">BY WAY OF TRUTH: ASPECTS OF NAH.MANIDES' KABBALISTIC HERMENEUTIC by ELLIOT R. WOLFSON Perhaps no one figure is more responsible for the legitimization of kab- balah as an authentic esoteric tradition of Judaism than Moses ben Nahman (1194-1270). Although from the beginnings of its literary history kabbalah was associated with men of rabbinic standing, such as R. Abraham ben David of Posquibres, no one before Nahmanides had attained a reputation for excellence in halakhic and mystical matters and had written extensively in both domains. Nalhmanides' involvement with kabbalah, especially in the context of a commentary on the Torah written for the layman, as the author plainly states in his introduction,' surely lent a stamp of approval to An earlier draft of this paper was read at a seminar of the combined faculties of Hebrew Union College, New York, and the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, New York University (April 1988). I would like to thank my colleagues, Professors Robert Chazan and Lawrence Schiffman, who read the earlier draft and made useful comments and suggestions. My gratitude is also extended to Professor David Berger, whose critical review of the manu- script has given me the opportunity to reformulate some of my arguments. Finally, I would also like to thank Professor Moshe Idel, who helped sharpen the focus of my analysis, even at points of disagreement, through extended conversations treating some of the issues that I have dealt with in this paper. 1.

Shem Tov ibn Gaon in his Baddei ha-'Aron u-Migdal Hiananel gave the following characterization of Nahmanides' kab- balistic literary activity: The great rabbi, Moses ben Nablman, may his memory be for a blessing, wrote his book [i.e., the commentary on the Torah] and a book [on] Job.2 He alluded to hidden matters in every place (npial  1npz ' minern Tra) to arouse [people's awareness] as is appropriate and according to what he received.3 However, he concealed his words to a high degree, for it is written, "Honey and milk are under your tongue" (Song of Songs 4:11).4 It is of interest to compare the above passage with a contemporary charac- terization given by Gershom Scholem: Nalhmanides ... hinted, in greater or lesser detail, at kabbalistic doctrines calculated to whet the reader's appetite for further initiation rather than to veil the mysteries. In this sense, the propagandistic impact of Nahmanides' writings cannot possibly be overestimated.5 Admittedly, Nahmanides' style is highly allusive and presents great diffi- culty for the uninitiated. Moreover, he himself urged his readers, in the introduction to the Torah commentary, to concentrate on his new insights regarding the plain meanings and the homiletical explanations (otvtrtn aT W, l a twen) and to leave aside the kabbalistic allusions, for in any event, claims Nahmanides, one can understand the latter only if one has a teacher to expound them and not by means of one's supposition or deduc- 2.

WOLFSON there have been several important scholarly contributions that have dealt with select aspects of Nalmanides' thought.8 In particular, the work of Moshe Idel should be singled out, for he has made the most systematic effort to characterize Nahmanides' kabbalistic orientation, especially as it compares and contrasts with the subsequent development of kabbalah in late-thirteenth-century Castile.9 What is still lacking, however, is a thorough understanding of the dynamics of Nahmanides' kabbalistic her- meneutical stance. The aim of this paper is to analyze some of the key features of this hermeneutic. The analysis will proceed from three vantage points: an examination of (1)the fundamental principle of the twofold nature of the text which informs Nahmanides' approach to Scripture; (2) the relation between the way ofpeshal (literal-narrative meaning)'0 and that of sod (esoteric meaning), most frequently referred to by Nahmanides as derekh ha-'emet (the way of truth);" and (3) the function of rabbinic 'agga- 8. The most important of these are the articles by J. Perles, B. Septimus, D. Berger, and A. Funkenstein mentioned below at various points in my analysis. See also the work of E. Gottlieb cited in the preceding note. Noteworthy as well are the valuable comments of Gershom Scholem scattered through many of his writings, but mostly in Origins of the Kabbalah, chap. 4, and Ha-Qabbalah be-Gerona (Jerusalem, 1974). Note should also be made of C. Henoch, Ha-Ramban ke-Hoqer u-khe-Mequbbal (Jerusalem, 1978), dealing mostly with Nahmanides' interpretation of the commandments. Concerning the latter, see also J. Katz, Halakhah we- Qabbalah (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 30-33. 9. See Idel, "We Have No Tradition," pp. 51-73. 10. Definitions of peshat are numerous, although it is usually rendered as the "plain," "simple," "literal," or "contextual" sense. For the most recent survey of various scholarly opinions, see S. Kamin, Rashi's Exegetical Categorization in Respect to the Distinction between Peshat and Derash (Jerusalem, 1986), pp. 12-14 [in Hebrew]. On p. 14 the author gives what seems to me to be a most sensible and comprehensive definition ofpeshat, and one that I believe is applicable to Nalmanides: "The explanation of a verse according to its language, syntactical structure, thematic connection, literary genre and structure, and the mutual relations between these elements." In my hyphenated expression "literal-narrative" I have tried to capture this sense of the term. See J. Rogers and D. McKim, The Authority and Interpretation of the Bible: An Historical Approach (New York, 1979), p. 16, who describe the biblical exegesis of John Chrysostom (347-407) and the Antiochene school from which he emerged as the "gram- matical-historical interpretation." See also Chrysostomus Baur, John Chrysostom and His Time (London, 1959), 1:90-91, 96. On the Antiochene school's reaction to the allegorism of the Alexandrian school of Christian exegetes, see J. Guillet, "Les Exegeses d'Alexandrie et d'Antioche, conflit ou malentendue?" Recherches de science religieuse 34 (1947): 257-302; H. de Lubac, L'Ecriture dans la Tradition (Paris, 1966), pp. 67-69; J. Pelikan, The Preaching of Chrysostom: Homilies on the Sermon on the Mount (Philadelphia, 1967), pp. 14-15. 11. It is of interest that in Isaac of Acre's 'OSar Iayyim, derekh ha-sod is distinguished from derekh ha-'emet. See, e.g., MS Guenzberg 775, fol. 13b, where a particular verse, accord-</page><page sequence="5">BY WAY OF TRUTH 107 dah in Nahmanides' kabbalistic exposition. Whether or not Nahmanides was the recipient of authentic ancient traditions, as Idel has forcefully argued,'2 it is only by fully exposing his presentation of kabbalistic doctrine that we will be able to evaluate the innovative or conservative trends in his exegesis and determine the role played by the creative religious imagination in his thought. I With respect to the question of Nalmanides' kabbalistic hermeneutic, one finds various views expressed in the scholarly literature. Amos Funken- stein, for instance, characterized Nalmanides' "kabbalistic reading" of Scripture as a "mystical-theosophical exegesis."'3 Idel reacts to this charac- terization by stating that such terms "fit the Zoharic perception of the Torah and its exegesis rather than Nabmanides." Indeed, says Idel, "it seems doubtful whether Nahmanides had a kabbalistic hermeneutical method of his own,"'4 by which the author means that Nahmanides did not have a her- meneutic orientation that was unique to him. In his Kabbalah: New Per- spectives Idel reiterates this view by drawing the following contrast between the hermeneutical assumption of the early period in Catalonia, epitomized by Nahmanides, and that of the later period in Castile, the generation of the Zohar. For the former kabbalah is "identified with specific traditions con- cerning limited segments of the Bible," whereas for the latter it "focuses on the results of powerful hermeneutic devices that enable the mystic to dis- cover the many hidden meanings latent in the canon."'" Hence, Idel bases his claim that Nahmanides has no hermeneutic method of his own on his view that Nahmanides had a limited corpus of esoteric truths that he had ing to the "way of mystery" ('al derekh ha-sod), is said to refer to Metatron, whereas according to the "way of truth" ('al derekh ha-'emet) it is said to refer to 'Atarah, i.e., the She- khinah. From this and other examples one may assume that the exegetical categories have dis- tinct ontological correlates: the derekh ha-'emet being reserved for the realm of the divine emanations, the sefirot, and derekh ha-sod for the angelic realm below the sefirot. 12.

WOLFSON received. That is, he did not systematically or creatively apply kabbalistic interpretations to Scripture, but only commented in this way where he had an authoritative tradition. Nalmanides thus leaves one with the impression of lacking a comprehensive hermeneutic. A careful analysis of this problem is crucial to a correct understanding of Nahimanides' thought and his contribution to both biblical exegesis and kabbalah. Let me begin by stating what I intend by the expression "her- meneutical method": a theoretical system of beliefs that determines one's understanding of a text and the operations of interpretation by which one applies those beliefs to specific texts.'6 Given this working definition, it seems to me undeniably the case that Nahmanides does exhibit such a kab- balistic hermeneutical method. The main difference between Nahmanides and the Zohar-i.e., with respect to the question of hermeneutical methodo- logy and not with respect to particular doctrinal points-lies in the fact that Nal.manides, as was pointed out by Joseph Perles in an article published in 1858, wanted to integrate better the esoteric interpretation with philological and aggadic concerns."7 This is not to say that the latter are not present to some degree in the Zohar; on the contrary, as Wilhelm Bacher demonstrat- ed, concern with peshat as well as 'aggadah and/or homiletics is found in the zoharic corpus.'8 The issue is rather that in the Zohar all other exegetical modes are subsumed under the theosophical. The author of the Zohar wanted to create a symbolic work of an independent status, whereas Nah- manides sought to provide a multidimensional commentary on the scriptur- al text in which kabbalistic explanations were accorded an important but relatively limited role from a statistical or quantitative point of view. With 16. My formulation is based partially on the definition of hermeneutics offered in Paul Ricoeur, Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences, ed. and trans. John B. Thompson (Cambridge, 1981), p. 43. I am not arguing that Nabmanides applies his hermeneutical method in any sys- tematic manner. Indeed, his approach is that of an exegete rather than a philosopher or logi- cian, responding therefore to the needs of the particular moment as determined by a given textual context. Nevertheless I think one can speak legitimately of a "hermeneutical method" in the case of the exegete, even if the underlying principles of interpretation are not stated in a methodical or systematic way. 17.

To be sure, Nah.manides works with an alternative conception of kabbalah, as may be adduced from his comments in the introduction to the Torah commentary, that involves not theosophy but a knowledge of Torah as consisting of an amalgam of divine names. Such a conception can be traced to much earlier sources and was shared in Nahimanides' time by the German Pietists and other kabbalists, most nota- bly, Abraham Abulafia.2' While it is undoubtedly true, as Idel has argued,22 that this tradition or kabbalah based on the divine names has no explicit theosophical implications, the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of 19. The limited scope of Nahmanides' kabbalah, as described by Idel (see above, nn. 14-15), seems to me to be beside the point with respect to the issue of the hermeneutical princi- ple that I am describing. After all, even if one accepts at face value that one can reconstruct all of Nahlmanides' kabbalah from his written documents, the fact is that he does make general claims in his writings about the nature of Torah which inform his hermeneutical stance. 20. Kabbalists are rarely interested in commenting on the whole biblical context. This is not to say that context is entirely irrelevant for kabbalistic exegesis, but rather that kabbalists were not intertested in taking the full context into account when offering their theosophic interpretations. In this respect the kabbalists, like the older midrashists, are "verse-centered." Cf. J. Kugel, "Two Interpretations of Midrash," in Midrash and Literature, ed. G. Hartman and S. Budick (New Haven, 1986), pp. 94-95. 21. See Scholem, On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism (New York, 1965), p. 39; Idel, "The Concept of Torah in the Hekhalot Literature and Kabbalah," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 1 (1981): 52-53 [in Hebrew]. 22. See Idel, "We Have No Tradition," p. 54, n. 10: "It is worth mentioning that Nah- manides conceives of Kabbalah as a tradition about the Divine Names having no explicit theo- sophical implications." See also the formulation of Idel, "Some Conceptions of the Land of Israel in Medieval Jewish Thought," in A Straight Path: Studies in Medieval Philosophy and Culture: Essays in Honor of Arthur Hyman, ed. J. Hackett et al. (Washington, 1988), p. 132: "Nalmanides... seemingly disregarded the esoteric nature of such other Kabbalistic topics as the names of the Sefirot." See, however, Funkenstein, "Nahmanides' Symbolical Reading of History," p. 134, who understands Nahmanides' statement that the Torah is comprised of divine names as alluding to "constellations within the divine realm," i.e., the sefirot, thus inter- preting Nah.manides in a theosophic way.</page><page sequence="8">110 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON Nah.manides' kabbalistic allusions do have theosophical implications and cannot be understood without the standard kabbalistic symbolism.23 It is thus clear that in practice Nahmanides read words of Scripture in a symbolic way that could be decoded only by reference to a theosophical kabbalah. The difference in the scope and variation of applicability of this symbolism between Nah.manides and the Zohar is, from the methodological point of view, insignificant. The fact that Nah.manides does interpret select words or expressions of Scripture as symbolic references to the divine colors his over- all hermeneutical stance vis-a-vis the text, even if this mode of interpreta- tion is not applied methodically and uniformly. Such a reading of Scripture, I submit, was equally shared by Nahmanides and the Castilian kabbalists who formed the circle of the Zohar, such as Moses de Le6n and Joseph Gikatilla. In agreement with Funkenstein,24 I would maintain that the kabbalistic hermeneutical method of Nahmanides is stated by the author himself in the context of his discussion on creation: "And know that in the truest sense Scripture speaks of lower matters and alludes to supernal matters," T'a' "nn~ on"l99 n'l' annn2.25 Although the statement occurs in the specific context 23. The precise relationship between the theosophical reading of Torah and this alternative magical-mystical one is not worked out in Nalmanides, as far as I can tell. See Joshua ibn Shu'aib, Derashot 'al ha-Torah (Cracow, 1573; reprint ed., Jerusalem,1969), fol. 59a, who cites and explicates Nahmandies' view about the primordial Torah. Ibn Shu'aib, based on a close reading of Nahmanides' introduction, concludes that this primordial Torah, written in one con- tinuous manner (nonDs na'nr), was in fact divided into three parts or aspects, connected exegeti- cally to the verse, "I wrote down for you a threefold lore," a,, "! ,nrnr (Prov. 22:20): (1) the names of God; (2) the fifty gates of understanding (mm) in which are included the account of the chariot, the account of creation, physiognomy and chiromancy, and all other possible wisdom; and (3) the Torah as we have it with accentuated marks and divisions of words (nvut ,ito mr n~ nar). If we assume that theosophic kabbalah is to be included in the second category, the fifty gates of understanding having a definite theosophic reference, as is clear from Nah- manides himself (see Perush, Introduction, pp. 3-4), then perhaps we have here an effort to combine the two esoteric traditions in some hierarchical fashion. The matter requires further investigation. Cf. ibn Shu'aib, fol. 4a, where he offers an alternative threefold division of the contents of Torah: (1) secrets of the account of the chariot and the account of creation; (2) posi- tive and negative commandments; and (3) narratives. See below, n. 44. On the conception of kabbalah as an esoteric tradition involving the divine names, see also Nahmanides' commen- tary to Exod. 28:30. 24. Cf. Funkenstein, "Nabmanides' Symbolical Reading of History," p. 133. 25. Perush, Gen. 1:2 (p. 15). That this statement refers to an emanative process in the sefiro- tic realm that parallels the creation of the lower worlds is clear from the various supercom- mentaries on Nahmanides. See Shem Tov ibn Gaon, Keter Shem Tov, in Ma'or wa-Shemesh,</page><page sequence="9">BY WAY OF TRUTH 111 of the creation story, it seems to me justified to extend its usage and to employ it as a general principle of methodology insofar as it assumes a cer- tain hermeneutical posture vis-a-vis the text that is reflected in the cosmic structure. Interestingly enough, this statement, or paraphrase of it, was already employed as a general hermeneutical principle in other contexts by a number of NahI.manides' disciples.26 Unlike Funkenstein, however, I do not understand the implication of this to be that there is a necessary divergence or discrepancy between the literal-narrative (peshal) and the mystical- theosophical (sod) interpretations. On the contrary, Nahmanides' her- meneutic is rooted in kabbalistic ontology which recognizes two parallel worlds, the divine and the mundane: what goes on below has a correspond- ing phenomenon above, just as what goes on above has its reflection below. The point is well-made in the anonymous text that apparently derived from the school of Nalimanides, Ma'arekhet ha-'Elohut. "In all of the section of Genesis the words have a double meaning ('iD: o' a1'1), revealed and hidden (rnotn ra), and both are true. For just as there are things below, so above there are things similarly called, and these [things above] are the foundation for things below which are in their pattern."27 The words of this kabbalist ed.

Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, pp. 207-209, where the author contrasts the hermeneutical stance of what he calls "theosophical" and "ecstatic" kabbalah on the grounds that the former, unlike the latter, knows no antinomy between the exoteric and esoteric, the plain and hidden meanings. Idel perceptively links the hermeneutical stance to the respective positions of the two schools on the question of the role of the body in religious life. That is, for the theosophic kabbalists, just as the body was seen as reflecting the higher structure of God, so the plain meaning was seen as reflecting the esoteric truth; for the ecstatic kabbalists, on the other hand, the body is seen as a hindrance to the mys- tical goal and, analogously, the plain meaning can be an obstruction to the hidden meaning. Concerning the latter, see also Idel, "Kitvei R. 'Avraham 'Abula'fiyah u-Mishnato" (Ph.D.</page><page sequence="10">112 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON are based on Nalimanides' own commentary to Gen. 3:22, as we shall short- ly see below. It is significant, however, that he has extended Nalimanides' hermeneutical principle from the particular case of the narrative about the Garden of Eden to the whole section of Genesis. It would not be incorrect, in my opinion, to further extend this principle to Scripture in general, as the notion of two layers of meaning reflecting two levels of reality is operative in other contexts in Nalhmanides' commentary as well. Here it would be beneficial to cite a few examples from NahI.manides himself. In his commentary to Gen. 3:22 Nalimanides maintains that while the Garden of Eden does literally exist on earth with all the details as described in the Bible, these matters nonetheless point to supernal realities: "All these things are twofold (abin),28 the overt and the hidden in them are true (nmx ona mannm ,1tn)."29 Elaborating on this point in his Sha'ar ha- diss., Hebrew University, 1976), p. 193, and idem, Language, Torah, and Hermeneutics in Abra- ham Abulafia (Albany, N.Y., 1988), pp. 73-74. In my view, Idel's characterization of the her- meneutics of theosophic kabbalah is a fitting characterization of Nahmanides as well, and one is therefore quite justified in speaking of a hermeneutical method in conjunction with the latter. 28. Nahmanides' position is brought into focus when one contrasts his sense of the twofold nature of scripture with that of the eleventh-century Northern French exegete, R. Solomon ben Isaac of Troyes (Rashi). The latter too employs twofold exegesis, but for him this means only that the literal-syntactical and homiletic-aggadic meanings exist simultaneously (cf. Nahman- ides' commentary to Gen. 8:4). There are no ontological correlates to these exegetical categ- ories, whereas for Nahmanides there are. On Rashi's view, see S. Kamin, Rashi's Exegetical Categorization, pp. 158-208. 29. Perush, Gen. 3:22 (p. 42). Cf. Babya ben Asher, Be'ur 'al ha-Torah, Gen. 2:9 (ed. Chavel, 1:67).

The twofold nature of Nahmanides' interpre- tation of this biblical episode has already been discussed by B. Safran, "Rabbi Azriel and Nab- manides: Two Views of the Fall of Man," in Rabbi Moses Nabmanides (Ramban): Explorations in His Religious and Literary Virtuosity, pp. 88-89. Safran, however, is not careful to distin- guish between his usage of the terms "allegorical" and "symbolic," and the reader is left with some confusion as to which term best describes Nahmanides' hermeneutical stance from his point of view. He thus writes: "Nabmanides repeats his contention that the Eden story is allegorical ... and goes on to explain that the serpent is symbolic of Samael, of Satan. The allegorical identification of the serpent in Sha'ar ha-Gemul corroborates the reader's sense of Nahmanides' direction, aTDc c',am" (p. 89, my emphasis). By understanding Nahmanides' use of the word aThsD in the sense of allegorical versus literal, Safran is led to the conclusion that for Nalimanides "there must be a sense in which the serpent is no serpent." In fact,</page><page sequence="11">BY WAY OF TRUTH 113 Gemul (the concluding part of Torat ha-'Adam), Nahmanides notes, with respect to all the matters pertaining to the Garden of Eden, that they are twofold because they are images from which one can understand the secret of deep matters, pie p', n"o ,'la "~1T "l r r .. .

Nah- manides wants to argue that the various elements of the Eden story are true in two senses- abie-in the literal sense and in a symbolic one. The symbolic meaning does not, however, undermine the literal. In kabbalistic terms, the serpent was a real serpent, but at the same time the serpent symbolizes the force of evil in the upper world, Samael. That this is the correct interpretation can be proven by a close examination of the context in Sha'ar ha-Gemul, for after Nahlmanides cites chapter 21 of Pirqei Rabbi 'Eli'ezer wherein the figurative explanations are given, he stresses from chapter 20 of the same work as well as from other rabbinic contexts that it is clear that the Garden of Eden was an actual garden on the earth, n m 'T aa how y'N wb ~  N r iU (Kitvei Ramban, 2:296). See also the citation below at n. 33, and the pas- sage from Ma'arekhet ha-'Elohut cited in n. 27. An allegorical reading attributed to Nahman- ides that leads to the denial of the reality of a biblical datum, such as that of Safran, simply misses the mark. See above, n. 25, and below, nn. 56 and 60. Indeed the reading of the biblical episode that Safran attributes to Nahmanides is the very one adopted by Abraham Abulafia, who openly rejected the literal meaning of the text and proffered in its place an allegorical one; see Idel, "Kitvei 'Avraham 'Abul'afiyah u-Mishnato, p. 223. R. Solomon ibn Adret was much more favorably disposed to the allegorical mode of exegesis, especially when applied to rabbinic aggadah. Cf. C. Horowitz, "'On the Rashba's 'Commentary to the Aggadot'-Between Kab- balah and Philosophy," Da'at 18 (1986): 15-25 [in Hebrew]; D. Horwitz, "The Role of Philo- sophy and Kabbalah in the Works of Rashba," pp. 89-118. See, however, She'elot u-Teshuvot le-RaSHBA 1:9, where ibn Adret criticizes those philosophers who treat matters in the Torah, such as resurrection of the dead, allegorically when these matters contradict the ways of reason. Ibn Adret's position is that at times verses in the Torah should be taken in an allegorical man- ner, but when there is a received tradition about a certain matter the literal meaning should not be denied even if it contradicts reason. The function of allegorical exegesis is even stronger in Bahlya ben Asher, who incorporated it as one of the four modes of interpretation of Scripture (see below, n. 60). See Idel, "We Have No Tradition," p. 69. On the kabbalistic aversion to alle- gorization of Scripture, see the comment of Recanati, Sefer Ta'amei ha-MiSwot (Basel, 1581), fol. 3a: "In every place in the Torah that you can elevate the event or the commandment to an entity higher than it, you must elevate it ... provided that you do not say that the matter is not as it is in its literal sense but it alludes to [or symbolizes] the thing above it." Recanati therefore advocates a symbolic reading of the text by means of which a particular narrative or command- ment is understood in terms of a higher process, but he cautions against this symbolic reading leading to a denial of the literal sense of the text. 30.

WOLFSON one should not merely treat matters pertaining to the lower Garden of Eden allegorically, thereby removing them from reality. On the contrary, he main- tains that the mundane realities exist both as entities in themselves and as symbols for the supernal entities in the celestial and divine realms:32 "For the words of Torah regarding the matter of the Garden of Eden are not parables without [literal] truth, and the words of our rabbis and the tradi- tion of the fathers ... in these matters are not vain talk or a parable in the figurative sense. Rather everything is true and reliable, the outer and inner, from grade to grade, and from elevation to elevation."33 Other examples may be gathered from various places in Nahmanides' commentary to the Torah. Thus, in Gen. 14:18, after explaining that Shalem refers to Jerusalem, NahI.manides notes that it was known through a tradi- tion (n'~p) that "Jerusalem corresponds to the upper temple in which is found the Shekhinah of the Holy One, blessed be He, who is called Sedeq."'34 Again, in his commentary to Lev. 23:24 Nalimanides notes that the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur allude to the ten sefirot. More specifically, the dynamic of these days involves the unification and balanc- ing of the attributes of mercy and judgment,35 the masculine and feminine made in the image of the upper sefirot . . . for there are upper potencies (nmm) that are called hand, foot, eye, head, as you find it written in Scripture in many places .... So in man there is an eye, a hand, and [other] limbs. And this is [the import of] the saying of the sages, blessed be their memory, 'The Torah speaks in the language of man.' In any event these [sefirot] are poten- cies and not [physical] limbs. Yet the limbs of man are called by [the names of] these potencies. Therefore the limbs of man and his intellect are like the sefirot." And cf. Sefer ha-Bahir, ed. R. Margaliot (Jerusalem, 1978), ?80 and the interpretation thereof in Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov, Sefer ha-'Emunot (Jerusalem, 1969), fol. 19b. 32. For Nahmanides, there are actually three levels: the earthly Garden of Eden, the heavenly Garden of Eden in the seventh heaven, 'Aravot, and the upper Eden in the divine realm, the Shekhinah, also referred to as the ,,nnl is1r, "bundle of life." See Kitvei Ramban, 1:160-161, 2:297-298. This structure is found in the Zohar and in the Hebrew theosophic writ- ings of R. Moses de Le6n as well, expressed in language that is derived from Nahmanides. For references, see Moses de Le6n, Shushan 'Edut, ed. G. Scholem, Qove; 'al Yad n.s. 8 (1976): 350, n. 164. See also I.

This kabbalistic truth is alluded to, moreover, by the astrological fact that the sign of this month is Libra, depicted by the scales of balance.36 Hence, the cosmic phenomenon struc- turally parallels or mirrors the theosophic reality. In his commentary to Num. 23:1 Nahmanides intimates that the seven altars built by Balak for Balaam symbolize the seven lower sefirot, and by means of the sacrifices offered on these altars Balaam sought to cleave to the divine will.37 The esoteric interpretation of the scriptural reference thus points to an ontologi- cal realm that parallels the mundane world. To cite one final example: in his commentary to Gen. 2:20 Nahmanides alludes to a kabbalistic meaning of the word nKt in the expression, ,x on iDen nKt, "this one at last is bone of my bones" (Gen. 2:23). He refers the reader to his commentary on Deut. 33:1 whence it becomes clear thatthe word nxt is a symbol for Shekhinah: , 38m'."a1n mnyr nir'lwn l t n nK' " a lD,.39 Now, Nahmanides' point is Midrash Tehilim 47:2. For the use of this motif in later kabbalistic sources, see references in my The Book of the Pomegranate: Moses de Ledn's Sefer ha-Rimmon (Atlanta, 1988), p. 144, n. 4 (Hebrew section). 36. Perush, 23:24 (pp. 153-154). Cf. the parallel in Nalhmanides' sermon for Rosh Ha- shanah, printed in Kitvei Ramban, 1:221. And cf. the anonymous fragment in MS Vat. 214, fol. 6b: D rn Tn' rnn' n~nm m vtn "no omn. 37. Perush, Num. 23:1 (p. 293). In Sha'ar ha-Gemul (Kitvei Ramban, 2:303) Nahmanides reiterates this symbolism but adds that the seven sefirot comprehended by the sages in this world are also alluded to in the seven candles of the menorah. It is interesting that in his com- mentary to Num. 23:1 Nabmanides approvingly notes that ibn Ezra had alluded to the mystical meaning of the number seven. For other points of contact with ibn Ezra on kabbalistic matters, see the references given by B. Septimus, "'Open Rebuke and Concealed Love': Nahmanides and the Andalusian Tradition," in Rabbi Moses Na#manides (Ramban): Explorations in His Religious and Literary Virtuosity, pp. 23-24, n. 43. See also Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, p. 387. Yet see the historically revealing remark of Isaac of Acre in Me'irat 'Enayim, pp. 81-82: "R. Abraham [t"1, i.e., R. Abraham ibn Ezra] did not speak in accordance with the way of kabbalah, which is the way of truth (nnn T tn' n;raPn "1" ), for he was not a kabbalist (Oipe)." R. Isaac's remarks are based on Nahmanides' own criticism of ibn Ezra in his com- mentary to Exod. 13:21. See also Nahmanides' own comment concerning ibn Ezra in his commentary to Exod. 33:12 (p. 519): "He could not know the truth, for he did not hear it nor did he prophesy (rt vL Yti iv t)." 38. See also Nahmanides' commentary to Exod. 25:3, Lev. 16:2. By contrast the word mt is a symbol for the masculine Yesod, the sign of the covenant (nr,~ mn); cf. Nahmanides, Exod. 15:2. 39.

WOLFSON clearly not that the Shekhinah is created out of earthly Adam, but rather that the mundane creation of Eve from the side (or rib) of Adam reflects the pro- cess above of the emanation of the feminine Shekhinah out of the masculine Tiferet.

This ontological parallelism, or in Nalhmanides' own language, this duplicity, holds the key to understanding kabbalistic symbolism as well as the effort of kabbalists, including Nabmanides, to link their system to the biblical corpus.43 Scripture contains, simultaneously, narrative and law, on 40. Be'ur le-Ferush ha-RaMBaN, fol. 3a. See also MenaIhem Recanati, Perush 'al ha-Torah (Jerusalem, 1961), Gen. 2:23, fols. 12a-b. 41. Cf. the "Secret of Du-Parqufim" attributed to R. Abraham ben David of Posquibres, published by Scholem, Reshit ha-Qabbalah (Tel Aviv, 1948), p. 79: "Adam and Eve were creat- ed du-parsufim. . .. it is well-known that two opposites were emanated, one of them judgment and the other mercy." Cf. Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, pp. 217-218; I. Twersky, Rabad of Posquibres (Cambridge, 1962), p. 291, n. 20; and, most recently, Idel, Kabbalah.: New Perspectives, pp. 128-129. 42. Published in Ma'or wa-Shemesh, fol. 29a. 43. The understanding of symbolism in kabbalah has been dominated by Scholem's view of the symbol, which, as is well known, was influenced by Romantic conceptions, particularly those of Goethe. (Cf. D. Biale, Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History [Cambridge, 1983], p. 138, n. 108; Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, p. 218.) According to Scholem, "the mystical symbol is an expressible representation of something which lies beyond the sphere of expression and communication" (Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism [New York, 1956], p. 27). Similar definitions are to be found in Isaiah Tishby (see Netivei 'Emunah u-Minut [Jerusalem, 1964], p. 13) and Joseph Dan (see The Early Kabbalah [New York, 1986], pp. 9-12). This con- ception of the symbol implies an unbridgeable gap separating signifier and that which is signi- fied, for the latter forever remains something hidden, inexpressible, out of range of phenome- nological discernment. It strikes me, however, that the force of symbols as they are understood by the kabbalists consists precisely in the fact that there is a much closer connection-indeed coincidence-between the signans and the signatum. The latter are two sides of one coin, the</page><page sequence="15">BY WAY OF TRUTH 117 the one hand, and theosophic truths, on the other.44 That this is Nahi- manides' overriding hermeneutical assumption may be ascertained from a telling remark that he makes in the sermon Torat ha-Shem Temimah. After one reflecting and influencing the reality of the other. (See U. Eco, Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language [Bloomington, 1984], p. 130.) There is no inexpressible signatum for the kabbalist; on the contrary, words from Scripture (or even later rabbinic texts) can be transformed into symbols precisely because the reality which they symbolize can be so expressed. In the absence of expression there is no symbol except for symbols that depict the inexpressible, such as 'Ein Sof (the Infinite), 'Ayin or 'Efes (i.e., Nothingness), or Ioshekh (i.e., Darkness), terms which have the symbolic function of being beyond expressibility and hence beyond symbolization. Where the symbol is something expressible, so too that which is symbolized. In the kabbalistic symbol the gap between abstract and concrete is closed, for there is only one reality with two parallel manifestations. Hence, the choice of particular symbols is not arbitrary but is deter- mined rather by the fact that there is something in the nature of that symbol that informs one about the essential reality of that which is symbolized. For a slightly different formulation, but one which similarly calls into question Scholem's point of view, see Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, pp. 231-232. 44. Here it is worth mentioning again (see above n. 23) that, as is evident from the introduc- tion to the Torah commentary, Nahmanides has besides the theosophic reading of Scripture another mystical tradition based on reading the text as a fabric of divine names. There too Nah- manides upheld the simultaneous veracity of two textual levels, the literal-narrative (inK'lp T'1 mn~m ni;rlnn ,rpt ) and the esoteric-mystical (mrnn tr ). Both ways of reading the text were given to Moses at Sinai, the former in writing and the latter orally. In this case it does not appear that the esoteric reading has anything to do with theosophical symbolism. See, however, Katz, Halakhah we-Qabbalah, p. 30, who assumes that Nahmanides is speaking about theo- sophic truths in his characterization of the Torah as an amalgam of names. What is not suffi- ciently worked out in Nahmanides is the relationship between the esoteric and exoteric reading with respect to the question of commandments. Interestingly, Abraham Abulafia, who employed Nathmanides' formulation of the Torah as being a composite of names as a corner- stone for his own hermeneutics (see Idel, "Kitvei R. 'Avraham 'Abula'fiyah u-Mishnato," pp. 177-178; and idem, Language, Torah and Hermeneutics in Abraham Abulafia, pp. 46-47) attempts in some passages to link the esoteric and exoteric levels. See, e.g., Sitrei Torah, MS Paris 774, fol. 119a, where the Written Torah is described as the Torah "understood in its plain meaning, all of its matters and commandments," whereas the Oral Torah is the Torah "in its secret meaning.. . having to do with the secret names and the reasons for the commandments." See Idel, Language, Torah and Hermeneutics, p. 171, n. 88. And cf. Sitrei Torah, fol. 125a, cited in Idel, op. cit., p. 55, where the revealed aspect of Torah is identified as the commandment and the concealed aspect as Torah, "for it refers to the entire body of wisdom of this command- ment, its purpose and its substance." Hence, in contrast to Nahmanides, at least as one may gather from his writings, Abulafia forges an essential link between the magico-mystical concep- tion of Torah as names and ;a'amei ha-miswot. Elsewhere Abulafia's formulation is closer to Nahmanides and no explicit relationship is established between the two modes of reading; see 'Osar 'Eden Ganuz, MS Oxford 1580, fols. 26a-b; Sefer Mafteah ha-.okhmot, the first part of the larger commentary on the Pentateuch entitled Sefer ha-Maftebot (cf. Idel, "Kitvei R. 'Avra- ham 'Abula'fiyah," pp. 20-21) preserved in MS JTS Mic. 1686, fols. 96a, 102a. Cf. ibid., fol. 146a.</page><page sequence="16">118 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON stating the view, repeated as well in the introduction to the Torah commen- tary, that all wisdom is contained in Scripture,45 Nalhmanides writes: 45. Cf. Perush, Introduction, p. 3.

Eleazar of Worms, Sefer ha-Shem, MS British Museum 737, fols. 205b-206a: "Why [are there] thirty-two [paths of wisdom according to Sefer Yesirah]? Because the Torah begins with [the letter] bet and ends with lamed [the conso- nants equal thirty-two] to teach you that everything is hinted at in the Torah but it is hidden from people, for the secrets of Torah were not transmitted but 'the secret of the Lord is for those who fear Him' (Ps. 25:14)." The view that all sciences are contained in the Torah is well- attested in the medieval philosophic literature as well; see H. Wolfson, Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Cambridge, 1947), 1:162-163; I. Twersky, "Some Non-Halakhic Aspects of the Mishneh Torah," in Jewish Medieval and Renaissance Studies, ed. A. Altmann (Cambridge, 1967), pp. 114-115. Cf. Maimonides, 'Iggeret Teiman, in 'Iggerot ha-RaMBaM, ed. J. Kafih (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 22. Idel, "We Have No Tradition," p. 62, notes the similarity between Maimonides' and Nahmanides' views regarding an ancient esoteric lore in Judaism. The crucial difference between the two, apart from the nature of the content of this lore, is with respect to the question of the remnant of this lore in medieval times. In Idel's mind, according to Maimonides, the tradition was completely lost and thus had to be reconstructed on the basis of philosophic sources; according to Nah- manides, however, there still are traces of this ancient lore lingering on in the tradition and one cannot therefore freely reconstruct it but rather must preserve the authoritative interpretations that we possess. In point of fact, however, at times Maimonides does speak of the ancient lore (consisting of physics and metaphysics) that was neglected and forgotten (cf. Guide of the Per- plexed, I, 71 and Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Qiddush ha-Hodesh 17:24; Altmann, "Das Verhiltnis Maimunis zur jiudischen Mystik," Monatsschrift fir Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums 80 [1936]: 315), but at other times he speaks of a residue of this lore in prophetic and rabbinic literature that can be rediscovered through interpretative techniques (cf. Guide of the Perplexed, Introduction; I, 17; II, 3, 11, 30). Cf. I. Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (New Haven, 1980), p. 370, who writes that Maimonides' "passion for philosophy is thus in a formal sense restorative rather than innovative." See also S. Rosenberg, "Biblical Exegesis in the Guide," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 1 (1981): 94-95 [in Hebrew]; A. Altmann, "Mai- monides on the Intellect and the Scope of Metaphysics," in his Von der mittelalterlichen zur modernen Aufklarung (Tiubingen, 1987), p. 129 and other references given there in n. 151. Cf. J. L. Teicher, "The Mediaeval Mind," Journal of Jewish Studies 6 (1955): 11, who writes that Maimonides' feeling "that he is only restoring and recovering the lost sciences of the ancient sages" is "typical, not of the Middle Ages, but of the Renaissance." In truth, however, the ten- dency to cloak innovation in the garb of traditional authority, and hence to present new insights as a recovery of ancient truth, is very characteristic of the medieval mentality; see the citation from J. Preus given below, n. 156. And cf. L. Berman, "Maimonides, the disciple of Alfarabi," Israel Oriental Studies 4 (1974): 167, n. 44, who describes Maimonides' "back pro- jection" of philosophy into rabbinic texts in light of Alfarabi's thesis that a truly virtuous reli- gion must have been preceded by demonstrative philosophy. Perhaps a more precise way of expressing the difference between Maimonides and Nahmanides would be with respect to the question of constraint on one's exegetical activity. Whereas Nahmanides restricts the viability of exegesis as a vehicle to establish kabbalistic lore, for these secrets were transmitted orally from Sinai and one therefore requires a teacher to ascertain them, it would seem that Mai-</page><page sequence="17">BY WAY OF TRUTH 119 In any event I am bothered, for I see that the Torah speaks about the account of creation and the wisdom of formation (,vrl?,, ~ n=nn nSNf'1 ,It r), but I do not know where it alludes to the account of the chariot. The upper chariot (mia',m ,ainl), which is the knowledge of the Creator (cila n,'r), is written in the Torah, but I do not know where there is an allusion in the Torah to the chariot of the palaces (nba1 'w varp , ). Perhaps it was an oral tradition (n,p io 5Y) until Ezekiel and Isaiah came and gave it [textual] support.46 There is little doubt that the cryptic reference to the upper chariot signifies the sefirotic realm, knowledge of which constitutes theosophic knowledge of God.47 Theosophic gnosis, therefore, is identified as an esoteric discipline monides allows for much greater exegetical freedom as long as one's interpretative stance accords with what is known from external sources to be rationally sound. 46. Kitvei Ramban, 1:163. 47. Cf. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 207. This identification of the upper chariot with the sefirotic realm also underlies the statement of R. Solomon ibn Adret in his letter to the Jews of Provence to the effect that "things alluded to in the commandments of the Torah [i.e., the kab- balistic ta'amei ha-miswot] constitute the ma'aseh merkavah." The letter is printed in 'Ein Ya'aqov to Sukkah 28a, 46b: j',u i pirnn n on ~ri D u rnoi ['n p pm, '1] T"n'n t' it in;V ,7TltD n 1n n1 a nin ana= Pn? nn 'T n,'1?1 a' lnmvIn. Cf. J. Katz, Halakhah we-Qabbalah, pp. 73-75; D. Horwitz, "The Role of Philosophy and Kabbalah in the Works of Rashba," pp. 87, 121-125. It must be pointed out that in the context of that letter ibn Adret is attacking the rationalists, who neglected the practical fulfillment of commandments such as prayer and phylacteries and instead were given to the study of philosophic and scientific books. Such people, following Maimonides no doubt, viewed the highest goal to be the study of ma'aseh merkavah, or metaphysics. Against them ibn Adret is skillfully pointing out that ma'aseh mer- kavak is essentially the study of the reasons for the commandments which are alluded to and contained (n~m7iil nmaii) in the actual precepts. (Hence the application of the term ma;vto i to the study of mra ,te, for the mystical reasons are comprised-mni1i -within the particu- lar commandments.) For a discussion of a similar theme in other thirteenth-century kabbalistic sources, see D. Matt, "The Mystic and the Miewot," in Jewish Spirituality from the Bible through the Middle Ages, ed. A. Green (New York, 1986), pp. 372-376; and E. Wolfson, "Mystical Rationalization of the Commandments in Sefer ha-Rimmon," Hebrew Union College Annual 59 (1988). See also She'elot u-Teshuvot ha-RaSHBA (Jerusalem, 1976), 1:94, where ibn Adret states that every commandment has a body and a soul, the latter being identified with the mystical reason of that particular commandment. And cf. J. Perles, R. Salomo b. Abraham b. Adereth sein Leben and seine Schriften (Breslau, 1863), pp. 28-29 (Hebrew section). The cen- trality of ta'amei ha-miswot in the kabbalah of NaImanides has been pointed out by Idel; see "We Have No Tradition," pp. 63, 67. See, in particular, Nabmanides' comment in his "Derashah 'al Divrei Kohelet," Kitvei Ramban, 1:190.

Hence, what is ontological parallelism from one point of view is sym- bolic accommodation from another.48 That is, just as on the metaphysical level the divine reality (composed of the dynamic potencies or emanations) is reflected and expresses itself in the mundane world, so too on the textual levelthe divine is reflected and expresses itself in concrete symbols-culled from Scripture-that are comprehensible to the human mind.49 The literal meaning thus corresponds to events in this world and the symbolic to events in the divine realm; just as the two realms are parallel so too the two levels of meaning.20 A classic example of this parallelism qua accommodation is to be found in Nalmanides' remark in his commentary on Gen. 1:3: Know that the days mentioned in the account of creation were in the creation of heaven and earth actual days (va p','), composed of hours and minutes, and there were six days of activity according to the literal meaning of Scripture (xKip~ St 1tv,). According to the inner sense of the matter (r3' nMrn',n1) the sefirot which emanate from above (p'n aflraKn nrnion) are called days, for every utterance that causes existence is called day (xKpn ,i'n 5u INxo  , another until Moses, our teacher, who received from God." The centrality of ta'amei ha-miSwot in kabbalah is also evident from the oft-cited quote from Meir ibn Sahula's commentary on Sefer Yesirah to the effect that kabbalah consists of two disciplines, the doctrine of the sefirot and the explication of la'amei ha-miSwot. See Scholem, Reshit ha-Qabbalah (Jerusalem, 1948), p. 17; Matt, "The Mystic and the Migwot," p. 377.

Yet the utterances were ten, for no day is grasped with respect to the first three [of the sefirot, Keter, Hokhmah, and Binah].52 According to Nahmanides, then, the literal meaning of the creation story is preserved, for there were six actual days, yet these days allude to a process going on in the divine realm."53 It is not sufficiently clear whether Nah.- manides maintained that the creation of the lower world took place con- comitantly with the emanation of the divine grades or whether he main- tained that chronologically the divine grades-the upper six days- emanated first and then at the end of the process the lower six days were created.54 Both possibilities were affirmed by thirteenth-century kabbalists, as was shown by Ephraim Gottlieb.55 In any event, what is clear is that, for Nalimanides, there are two distinct but parallel ontological levels that cor- respond to two levels of meaning in the text. In this regard Nahmanides would have assented in form to Maimonides' 51. The nao is thus equated with the "Kx, which causes the existence of the ,nr, the latter term being a technical reference in Nalhmanides for a cosmic cycle; see his commentary to Lev. 25:2.

Idel, "The Sefirot above the Sefirot," Tarbiz 51 (1982): 245-246 (in Hebrew). A similar expression occurs in a kabbalistic explanation of the Sinaitic theophany found in a collection of materials, apparently from the school of R. Solomon ibn Adret, extant in several manuscripts, including MSS JTS Mic. 1895, fol. 7a, 1896, fols. 78a-b, and 8124, fol. 5b; Ibn n ro nI~ c ', , 1 K'o"w mnlit ', , nivo ', vn0 i, , i " .

For Nahmanides the six days of creation also prefigure the six millennia of world history. Cf. Perush to Gen. 2:3; Exod. 20:11, 21:2; Lev. 23:36, 25:2. Cf. Funkenstein, "Nah- manides' Symbolic Reading of History," p. 140. See also She'elot u-Teshuvot le-RaSHBA 1:9 and 423. The theosophical and typological interpretations are brought together by Menahem Recanati in the introduction to his Sefer Ta'amei ha-Miswot, fol. 3a: "The seven last sefirot are the seven days of creation, as is known to the sages of kabbalah. And do not wonder at the fact that the sages of kabbalah said that the secret of the seven days of creation alludes to what was and what will be afterward. This can be understood from what the rabbis, blessed be their memory, said. 'The world exists for six thousand years and is desolate for one thousand' [cf. b. Sanhedrin 97a]." 54. For the latter view, see Keter Shem Tov, fol. 25b.

In addition, he refers in positive terms to a statement of Abraham ibn Ezra from the introduction to his Torah commentary: As it is said, "For understanding proverb and epigram, the words of the wise and their riddles," Drvm ,r'r n ,~' ?ri r ar i tv~ n (Prov. 1:6).

Thus the chapter, "A capable woman who can find?" (Prov. 31:10).

Guide of the Perplexed, Introduction, and I, 71. A clear formulation of the Mai- monidean perspective is given by R. Levi ben Abraham ben Hayyim in his Liwyat .Hen, extant in MS Oxford 1285, fol. 35a. In this regard Teicher's characterization of R. Solomon ibn Adret as one who sought a "compromise between the fundamentalist's view and a selection of some elements of Maimonides' view" is applicable to Nahmanides as well. See Teicher, "The Mediaeval Mind," p. 8. That is to say, NaIhmanides employed the Maimonidean esoteric- exoteric distinction in his hermeneutic, but he wished to maintain a fundamentalist reading of the text that unequivocally preserved the literal, historical sense. See above, n. 29. 57. Interesting in this regard is a passage in Abraham Abulafia's Sitrei Torah, MS Paris 774, fol. I 115a, wherein he tries to uphold the truth of the revealed aspect of Torah, i.e., the liter- al sense, as well as the concealed aspect, i.e., the mystical sense. The Torah, says Abulafia, "operates on two levels of existence ... the revealed and concealed aspects." Abulafia then compares the two respectively to the body and the soul. Here it would seem that we have an instance of trying to connect the Maimonidean hermeneutic with ontic categories, or, in Abula- fia's terms, "two levels of existence." In fact, however, as Idel has shown, Language, Torah and Hermeneutics, p. 77, the meaning of this passage is that there is only one reality, and the con- cealed aspect consists of the fact that this world preexisted. That is to say, the esoteric sense is basically a denial of a traditionalist view of creation. For Maimonides there is one cosmic con- tinuum with the divine agent outside the world; for the kabbalists, by contrast, the divine and cosmic are not only parallel worlds but they are intersecting realms that mutually interact and interpenetrate.</page><page sequence="21">BY WAY OF TRUTH 123 lizes, nnVln)58 the act of Torah ....

Weiser (Jerusalem, 1977), 1:7. 60. It is of interest that the one layer of meaning that Nab.manides neglects is precisely the one utilized by Maimonides, viz., the allegorical. Cf. Guide of the Perplexed III, 8, where the "capable woman" of Prov. 31:10 is interpreted as an allegorical reference to matter. See also ibid: I, 34, where "Do not give your strength to women" (Prov. 31:3) is interpreted as a refer- ence to material or sensual pursuits. Cf. Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot De'ot 4:19. If one were to add the allegorical to Nahlmanides' list, then one would have a striking example of the four levels of meaning that one finds explicitly for the first time in kabbalistic sources from the end of the thirteenth century. See W. Bacher, "L'ex~gese biblique dans le Zohar," Revue des itudesjuives 22 (1891): 37-39; P. Sandler, "On the Problem of Pardes," Festschrift for E.

On Nahmanides' general avoidance of allegory as an exegetical technique, see Scholem, op. cit., p. 53, and idem, Origins of the Kabbalah, p. 386. And see above nn. 29 and 56. Scholem's description of Nahmanides is, of course, one specific example of his overall position that the medieval kabbalists employed symbols in place of the allegories utilized by the philosophers. See e.g., Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 26-27; Origins, p. 407. Scholem's allegory-symbol schematization, based as it is on the Romantic model of Goethe, has been criticized by several scholars. See E. Schweid, "Mysticism and Judaism according to Gershom Scholem: A Critical Analysis," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought, Supplement 2 (1983): 18-20 [in Hebrew]; M. Saperstein, Decoding the Rabbis (Cambridge, 1980), p. 220, n. 62; Uri Shoham, Ha-Mashma'ut ha-'Aberet (Tel Aviv, 1982), pp. 61-64; Tal- mage, "Apples of Gold," p. 341; and Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, pp. 218-219. Notwith- standing the need to revise Scholem's oversimplified schema, it seems to me that his characteri- zation is accurate as far as Nahmanides goes, although this does not imply that Nahmanides never relies on the mode of allegorical exegesis (see, e.g., Perush, Gen. 6:6, to be discussed below). For an example of Nahmanides' rejection of allegorical interpretation, see Kitvei Ramban, 1:24. Nalmanides rejects the philosophers who allegorically explain Satan, the angel of death, or the evil inclination (identified as such by Resh Laqish; see b. Baba Batra 16a) as a reference to the material principle in the world. "The sages of Israel attributed to him [i.e., Satan] all these names because of their conviction that he is an existing angel and not some natural phenomenon or force." For a discussion of some of the sources in which this allegorical conception of Satan is found, see M. Idel, Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah (Albany, 1988), pp.</page><page sequence="22">124 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON turn, fall under a twofold classification between the external and internal sense, the literal corresponding to the former, and the homiletical together with the kabbalistic to the latter. It is important here to keep in mind the technical philosophical terminology upon which Nahlmanides is drawing: he is using mashal and melisah synonymously to refer to the external sense or that which is uttered or expressed,6' whereas hokhmah and hidah are used to connote the internal sense and hence the sod of the matter. In other contexts, 34-35. See also D. Silver, "Nachmanides' Commentary on the Book of Job," p. 15, who has pointed out that in his comments to Job 1:1 Nahmanides emphasizes the historicity of this biblical episode and thereby tacitly rejects the allegorical line of interpretation suggested by the rabbis and reinforced by Maimonides. Finally, in Sha'ar ha-Gemul, Kitvei Ramban, 2:283, Nahimanides affirmed the actual existence of Gehenna as a distinct locality. This stands in marked contrast to Maimonides' interpretation of Gehenna as an allegory for an individual's punishment. Maimonides was already attacked for this allegorical interpretation by Meshullam ben Solomon Dapiera; see H. Brody, "Poems of Meshullam ben Solomon Dapiera," Studies of the Research Institute for Hebrew Poetry in Jerusalem (Jerusalem, 1938), 4:17. A mediating position between Maimonides and Nalimanides was attempted by ibn Adret; see discussion in D. Horwitz, "The Role of Philosophy and Kabbalah in the Works of Rashba," pp. 105-107. Nahmanides' upholding of a literal reading of Scripture and his frequent rejection of allegorical interpretations thus has to be seen as a reaction to Jewish rationalistic tendencies. It should be noted that other Jewish exegetes, especially in the Franco-German orbit, e.g., Joseph Bekhor Shor, Solomon ben Meir, David Kimli, Meir ben Simeon, and the anonymous author of Sefer ha-Maskil, reacted to both Jewish and Christian allegorists.

On the Arabic root underlying the medieval usage of ar'9m for the external sense or utterance, cf. H. Wolfson, Crescas' Critique ofAristotle (Cambridge, 1929), p. 639.

These are not to be construed as mutually exclusive phenomena. Nah- manides wants to preserve both the literal and the symbolic as simul- taneously valid readings of the text. Nahlimanides expresses this dual nature in several places in his biblical commentary and other writings, particularly with respect to the relationship between peshat and midrash or 'aggadah.64 That Nalimanides used these 62.

To be sure, although this usage became widespread in medieval Hebrew literature, especially in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the word 5e was used in the sense of allegory already in clas- sical midrashic literature; see S. Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York, 1962), p. 68, and other references given there in n. 170. 63. See, for instance, the introduction of Abraham ibn Ezra to his Perush 'al ha-Torah, ed. Weiser, 1:6. On the words mashal and hidah as synonyms for allegory in Maimonides, see Guide, Introduction; Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuvah 8:2, and Hilkhot Melakhim 12:1. Cf. Bacher, Ha-RaMBaM Parshan ha-Miqra', pp. 19-20, n. 6. See also the comments of Scholem, On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, p. 55, n. 2. And cf. Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor, Perush al ha-Torah (London 1956), Num. 12:8, p. 78 (for a detailed analysis of this passage, see S. Kamin's article mentioned above n. 60). For some kabbalists mashal was used in the sense of kabbalistic symbol. See Judah ben Yaqar, Perush ha-Tefillot we-ha-Berakhot, ed. S. Yeru- shalmi (Jerusalem, 1979), pt. 1, p. 98, who comments on the merkavah tradition of the image of Jacob inscribed on the Throne in these words: mno ?St TVT ;t bzi; and see Perush 'al Shir ha- Shirim, Kitvei Ramban, 2:481, where R. Ezra of Gerona says about the term wine: ,z JD in? thy ,np br e i~i (cf.

Kaufman (New York, 1926), p. 143, where Sea, ,~La, and ,'n refer respectively to allegory, the literal sense, and kabbalistic meaning.

WOLFSON latter two terms interchangeably can be seen from his famous statement about the status of 'aggadah at the Barcelona disputation, to be discussed more fully below: "We have besides [Bible and Talmud] a third [kind of] book called midrash, that is to say, sermons.... We also call this [kind of] book 'aggadah ... that is to say, they are merely things that one man tells another."'65 I would like to focus particularly on a comment that Nah- manides makes in his notes to the second principle in the introduction to Maimonides' Sefer ha-Miswot. In the context of that principle, which is essentially Maimonides' view that not every miswah derived from Scripture on the basis of the thirteen hermeneutical principles or by amplification (,~11) is to be counted in the class of 613 divine commandments (i.e., biblical precepts) given to Moses at Sinai, Maimonides notes that sometimes the rabbis derived laws from Scripture without any textual basis. This proce- dure, argues Maimonides, goes against the rabbinic dictum ,, K1'x K~1~b ,K lntvon, a biblical verse should never lose its literal sense.66 In reaction to 65. Kitvei Ramban, 1:308. The interchangeability of the words Dvwl and ,mxm is by no means unique to Nahlmanides. See, e.g., Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne, Sefer ha-'Eshkol, ed. B. H. Auerbach (Halberstadt, 1868), pt. 2, p. 47. See also the sources cited in Talmage, David Kimh.i: The Man and the Commentaries, pp. 74-76. 66. Cf. b. Shabbat 63a; Yevamot 1 b and 24a. Of the many discussions concerning this rab- binic principle, see in particular I. Frankel, Peshat in Talmudic and Midrashic Literature (Toronto, 1956), pp. 71-77; R. Loewe, "The 'Plain' Meaning of Scripture in Early Jewish Exegesis," pp. 164-167; S. Kamin, Rashi's Exegetical Categorization, pp. 37-43. Maimonides' position is that in the case of an explicit tradition that is traced back to Mosaic revelation at Sinai it is possible for a halakhic exegesis to take the verse in a nonliteral way. The limitation on nonliteral exegesis is only applicable in those cases where there is no explicit tradition. Cf. Maimonides' introduction to his commentary on the Mishnah, Seder Zera'im, in Mishnah 'im Perush ha-RaMBaM, ed. Kafih., pp. 9-10, where he makes clear that those laws which are con- sidered T''o nzee ,, cannot be derived on the basis of the hermeneutical principles nor is there any allusion to them in Scripture. Cf. Maimonides' commentary to Nazir 4:7, in Kafih ed., Seder Nashim, p. 123: "this law has no allusion (Tni) in Scripture but is only a tradition (nbip)." A similar formulation appears in Maimonides' commentary to Sanhedrin 6:6, ed. Kafih., Seder Neziqin, p. 119. And see Maimonides' commentary to Kelim 17:12, ed. J. Kafih, Seder Toharot, p. 100: "Whatever is not explained in the language of the Torah (,iinn Tpvwh) is called 'from the words of the scribes' (,aD'1o vmi), and [this includes] even those things which are laws [given] to Moses at Sinai (',T 'o ~ , ,b), for the meaning of [the expression] 'from the words of the sages' is that the matter is either a scribal tradition [aoaor naip, but see the alternative reading from the standard printed edition cited by Kafih., n. 26, which has nu' instead of n5p] as all the explanations and laws that were received (mpp) from Moses, or a scribal amendment (,'ao ppn), as all the amendments and decrees." Extrabiblical scribal tradi- tions thus comprise two categories for Maimonides: either that which was received from Moses</page><page sequence="25">BY WAY OF TRUTH 127 Maimonides, Nahmanides emphasizes that with respect to biblical interpre- tations connected with halakhic matters the verse does not lose its literal sense (ttnv 'r'? K~' Ki 1 pi n TKl n; T, Dt~t D'ViDlt) because all these interpretations are contained in the language of the text (ainrn T1D ) D1 aD5~").67 Nahmanides goes on to contrast his conception ofpeshat with both those "who lack knowledge of the language" (ptn trT n'on)--or, according to another reading, the "language of those who lack knowledge" (,'on T1V, nriu)-and the Karaites, referred to as the oi~,rt, i.e., the Sadducees. While it is not entirely clear to whom Nahmanides refers by the first category, I would suggest that Nahmanides may be attacking those who would limit peshat to the sensus litteralis as established purely on philological grounds, i.e., on the basis of the grammatical and syntactical construction of Scrip- ture. Like the Karaites, such a group would fail to see that Scripture is mul- tilayered and that rabbinic interpretations are themselves part of the text. In Nahlimanides' words: "the text contains everything (in ~,ib m~i~,) ... for the book of God's Torah is complete (in~rn 'n min "Dr o ,), there is no extra word in it nor any lacking, everything was written in wisdom."'68 Rabbinic interpretations, therefore, are to be seen as organically connected to, or anchored in, the text and not as some external imposition upon it. Here we have a striking example of a phenomenon noted already by Bernard Septi- mus: Nalimanides advanced the Andalusian tradition of peshat "by broadening the conception of interpretation" to include rabbinic, halakhic, and aggadic, as well as kabbalistic, modes of explanation.69 This is not to or that which was instituted by the sages. Concerning the latter, see the monograph by J. Neubauer, Ha-RaMBaM 'al Divrei Soferim (Jerusalem, 1957). See also the commentary of R. Aryeh Leib Horowitz, Margenita' Tava', to Sefer ha-MiSwot (Jerusalem, 1985), 18b, s.v., vw ~,5 67.

WOLFSON say, of course, that in Nahmanides' opinion every rabbinic statement may be considered to contribute substantially to the peshat of the verse. On the contrary, any careful reader of Nahmanides' biblical commentary is well aware of the fact that he distinguishes different methodological approaches to the text, and on occasion flatly rejects aggadic or midrashic explanations (a point to be discussed further on) on grounds that they do not edify the literal sense of the text. Indeed, Nahmanides goes on to say, in the very con- text that we are discussing, that the rabbinic dictum Itt~iv ,'r YI w'jp I'K refers to incidents wherein the rabbis, through their halakhic interpreta- tions, "uprooted the literal sense completely" ,'na t~vn triT D'1pi Drv. The key point is, however, that for Nahmanides both contextual and midrashic (used now in the broad sense of the term) meanings are to be found in the text: "the verses of Scripture are true literally and figuratively," nrx D,'an1, km ,shb..70 He therefore embraces the form of the Maimonidean her- meneutic, even in the context of criticizing Maimonides. Thus is the matter in every place interpreted by them [i.e., the rabbis] with respect to the figurative and literal sense (rxl SVt ,7', n t 1 m olTn 53,), they believed that both were true, the internal and the external (' 'a nrN ti'n, ,Prm). .... And this is [the meaning] of their dictum t3wi3 'tr' NXi, K Ej' K, a verse should not lose its literal sense; they did not say, tlvDDe ~N Kijt p,, i.e., the verse is only according to its literal sense. We have rather the interpreta- tion [of the verse] together with its literal sense (iitt r ~~ 1i5 w'), and it analysis is a passage from Sefer ha-.Hokhmot cited by Idel, "Kitvei R. 'Avraham 'Abul'afiyah," p. 222, for the view expressed by Abulafia resembles Na.hmanides' position. According to Abulafia the Torah is given in three ways that correspond to the tw (literal), tvv, (interpreta- tive or explanatory), and vrn or rrK (homiletical and legendary or mythical). "It was necessary for the Torah to perfect the house of the righteous by means of these three ways. The first ones are dependent on the literal sense (t~Wo) .... The second is its [i.e., the verse's] interpretation (01Dv), for even the words of interpretation (W'in 'rf') are in accordance with their literal sense (alwivz). And the third are the homiletical and legendary [or mythical] (,r'xni w-t,n) when they too are understood according to their literal sense (Dimvn).... It is appropriate to include all three ways in the first name, since all are the own." For a different rendering in English, see Idel, Language, Torah, and Hermeneutics, p. 90. Mention should also be made of Isaac ibn Latif's somewhat unusual classification of the four methods of scriptural interpretation: the literal (mL,~n prnp'), which comprises grammatical meaning; the aggadic, which is identified as twn; the allegorical (5v); and the mystical (vnr).

On the contrary, Scripture must bear every- thing, and both [the literal and figurative] are true.7 This notion of two layers of meaning embedded in the text is the basic her- meneutical principle underlying Nahmanides' approach to Scripture. What- ever ancient teachings he was working with, if any, were channeled through this understanding of the text. The Torah could yield at once historical and metaphysical truths. There are, in particular, two critical relationships that must be examined against the background that I have laid in the first sec- tion, viz., the relation between literal and esoteric, and, secondly, the rela- tion between Nahmanides' kabbalistic allusions and the interpretation of relevant aggadic sources. It is to these two themes that we must now turn our attention. II At this juncture it would be beneficial to take up the issue of the relation- ship between peshat and sod in Nahmanides' thought. Several scholars have addressed the question of peshat versus sod, literal versus esoteric, in Nah- manides' biblical exegesis, though a comprehensive treatment is still want- ing. Funkenstein maintained that there is only one place in Nahmanides' commentary where peshat and sod overlap or correspond, viz, the rationale for sacrifices offered at Lev. 1:9.72 Elsewhere peshat and sod are, in Funken- stein's words, "quite divergent-at times even grammatically so."73 Bernard Septimus and David Berger, by contrast, have pointed out in independent studies that in many instances kabbalah and the search for peshat converge in Nahmanides. Septimus, for his part, lists thirteen instances of this phenomenon in the Torah commentary and suggests that it "requires separ- ate treatment."74 Berger, noting some of these examples and adding a few more both from the commentary and other works of Nahmanides, con- cludes, contra Funkenstein, that "Nalhmanides displays a pronounced 71.

WOLFSON tendency to equate peshat and sod by finding that the plain meaning of Scripture can be explained satisfactorily-or most satisfactorily-only by resorting to kabbalistic doctrine.""75 From my own examination of the relevant sources it has become clear that the critique of Funkenstein's position by Septimus and Berger is cor- rect, for the sharp distinction between peshat and sod in Nah.manides suggested by Funkenstein cannot be upheld. On the other hand, the rela- tionship of these two layers of meaning in all the cases noted by Septimus and Berger is not identical. A detailed analysis of the relevant sources reveals certain nuances that deserve more careful attention. In those cases in Nah.manides' commentary where there appears to be an overlapping of peshat and sod, and where the latter does indeed connote a kabbalistic truth,76 I have been able to demarcate two main lines of orientation. In some 75. Berger, "Miracles and the Natural Order in Nahlmanides," in Rabbi Moses Nah- manides, p. 112, n. 19. 76. In fact, it is not at all evident that Nahmanides consistently employs the term sod to refer to kabbalistic truth. Cf. Nahmanides' commentary to Lev. 16:8 (cited by Septimus) where the secret of the matter (tpam no) of the scapegoat to Azazel, based on ibn Ezra's esoteric explanation, is explained as an offering on behalf of God to the force of destruction in the world that is connected with Mars in the celestial realm, with Esau (i.e., Christianity) in the earthly realm, with goats in the animal kingdom, and with demonic forces that Scripture refers to as ovw' (satyrs). It is interesting to note as well that in that context Nahmanides approvingly cites ibn Ezra's Neoplatonic position. See parallel in Kitvei Ramban, 1:165, where Nahmanides' refers to ibn Ezra's no and calls it the plain meaning, "bltt i'T. And cf. Perush, Lev. 18:25, where the "secret of the matter," "ir nmo, refers to a mystical-though not kabbalistic-idea rooted in older aggadic sources; the text is discussed below. See also the commentary to Lev. 23:17. In another case, not noted by Berger or Septimus, in his commentary to Num. 21:9 Nahmanides explains the "secret of the matter" (anM nn) concerning the serpent of brass made by Moseses a reference to the medical principle that illness is sometimes healed by means of the cause of the sickness. Such a principle does not seem to me to have anything uniquely or intrinsically kab- balistic about it, even though kabbalists may have employed some such view in their theosophic systems. See the commentary of Menahem Recanati to Num. 21:8, fol. 77d. Recanati cites the "esoteric" interpretation (sod) of Nahmanides and calls it peshal; 'D , D'f, i "T 9" , ,n1 '12 IK twon. Recanati goes on to suggest, in contrast to Nahmanides' view, an esoteric interpretation based on a zoharic passage (cf. Zohar 3:130b). Cf. Perles, "Ueber den Geist des Commentars des R. Moses ben Nachman zum Pentateuch," p. 118, n. 6. See also Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 201: "I am astounded at the RaMBaN, blessed be his memory, for he mentions a secret ('io) in connection with this matter [i.e., the brass serpent of Num. 21:8] but does not allude to any secret. . . . Perhaps the Rabbi [Nahmanides] called even a physical entity (1it 't3) a secret, since they are hidden from the many." It should be noted that R. Isaac also offers his own kabbalistic interpretation: the brass serpent symbolized the unity of mercy and judg- ment, for through it God had the power to both heal and wound. And cf. Kitvei Ramban, 1:262 where we find the expression pen~r -not used to designate the secret of messianic computation. See, by contrast, Scholem's unqualified statement in Origins, p. 387: "Authors like Ezra and</page><page sequence="29">BY WAY OF TRUTH 131 instances the literal and mystical meanings overlap because there is only one textual dimension, whereas in other instances there is an overlapping but the text allows for two levels, exoteric and esoteric. In the former there is a com- plete identity between peshat and sod in the realm of exegesis which refers to only one distinct reality outside the text; in the latter there is no such identity in the realm of exegesis but only an overlapping that allows for two levels of meaning-literal and mystical-which refer to two levels of reality- mundane and divine. In what follows I will provide detailed examples from Nahlmanides' commentary for each of these typologies. 1. I will begin by discussing some of the contexts where this overlapping of peshat and sod actually implies a form of identification. In such cases, it seems, we are dealing with only one possible interpretation, with only one textual dimension. That is, the text can only be understood in one way, for the literal sense is only explicable by means of kabbalistic truths. In these instances, then, Nal.manides transmits kabbalistic truths as if he were expli- cating the literal sense of the text. Thus, for example, Nahmanides' under- standing of the narrative in Gen. 38 concerning levirate marriage is such that the peshat of the text is speaking about the esoteric tradition concerning transmigration of the soul.77 There is no other way to read the text but in this light: the sod of yibbum constitutes the narrative stuff of the biblical tale. As was noted above, Funkenstein already observed that in his commentary to Lev. 1:9, "And the priest shall turn the whole into smoke on the altar, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the Lord," Nal.hmanides equates the literal and mystical meaning, particularly with respect to the term ,w aIS. Nah.manides takes issue with ibn Ezra's rendering of the expression ,in as an adjective describing the word an1 in the verse, i.e., the whole-everything sacrificed by the priest-went up in the fire, and suggests instead that it should be taken in the nominative form, i.e., an offering by (or of) the fire. The whole matter is explained in the Torah in which it is said, "My offering, Nal.manides ... understood by sod only that which, in their circle, had already become the subject of a kabbalistic tradition." See also D. Horwitz, "The Role of Philosophy and Kabba- lah in the Works of Rashba," pp. 100-101, who writes that "the word sod according to Rashba (as according to Ramban) had a specific connotation: the sefirotic doctrine of the Gerona school." It can be shown, at least in the case of Nalmanides, that this characterization is not borne out by the textual evidence. 77. The same may be said about Nabmanides' reading of Job 32:3 in his commentary ad loc.; see Berger, "Miracles and the Natural Order," p. 112., n. 19. See also Katz, Halakhah we- Qabbalah, p. 31.</page><page sequence="30">132 ELLIOT R.

The word rK is a noun like the word vK, and [the expression] rvK r~iV (cf. Lev. 1:9) is [to be rendered] as ivK nhu [i.e., an offering of fire] "of pleasing odor to the Lord" (ibid.), and so are all such expressions, for their meaning is like rvK Dn [i.e., the food of the fire offering, the word ,rv being therefore a noun]. It does not say, however, VK but rather tVK in accordance with its literal sense (wVm), "as you were shown on the mountain" (Exod. 27:8) at the giving of the Torah, and this is the sacrifice with the attribute of judgment.78 This complicated exegesis serves as part of Nahmanides' effort to resolve the apparent tension between those biblical passages related to matters pertain- ing to sacrifices that employ the name Elohim, or any of its derivatives such as El, Elohekha, Elohehem, and so on, and the rabbinic teaching, attributed to Simeon ben Azai,79 that in the scriptural mentioning of sacrifices only the Tetragrammaton is employed. The resolution of this conflict involves a kabbalistic truth regarding the unity of the two attributes symbolized by the two names. That is to say, by its nature the sacrifice derives from the side of judgment, referred to by the name Elohim and symbolized by the fire, but the requirement is to sacrifice to the attribute of mercy, referred to by the Tetragrammaton. By means of this kabbalistic notion Nalhmanides can resolve the obvious textual inconsistencies with the rabbinic generalization. It is perfectly sensible for Scripture to employ Elohim, or any of the names associated with it philologically, in connection with sacrifices, because the nature of the sacrifice is such that it is related to this divine attribute;80 on the other hand, the mandate is to sacrifice to the attribute of mercy so that the two attributes will be united.8' The crucual point for this analysis is that in this context Nalhmanides relies on a kabbalistic motif-the essential con- nection of sacrifice and the attribute of judgment-to explain the literal 78. Perush, Lev. 1:9 (p. 13). 79. Cf. b. Menallot 1 10a; Sifre Be-Midbar, pisqa 143. 80. Cf. Perush, Lev. 23:17; "for sacrifices are to the will of the honorable name, Tr, vtu [i.e., the Shekhinah]." 81. See ibid., where the need to combine the attributes of mercy and judgment is also con- nected to the act of sacrifices. For a study of a similar motif in much earlier sources, see Y. Baer, "The Service of the Sacrifice in Second Temple Times," Zion 40 (1975): 95-153 [in Hebrew].</page><page sequence="31">BY WAY OF TRUTH 133 meaning of the biblical expression, ne, iw', and indeed on the basis of it rejects the view proferred by ibn Ezra. To take a few other examples from the Torah commentary where Nah- manides unequivocally understands the sensus litteralis of the biblical nar- rative in terms of kabbalistic theosophy. In his commentary to Exod. 14:19, "The angel of God (Pn'In ' d), who had been going ahead of the Israelite army, now moved and followed behind them," Nahmanides rejects ibn Ezra's explanation that the angel of God refers to the "great prince" (iv h'nan), i.e., the archangel Michael,82 arguing instead as follows: In my opinion that which Scripture said, "The angel of God now moved," occurred at the beginning of the night, and "the angel of God who had been going ahead of the Israelite army" alludes to the Court of the Holy One, blessed be He, for the attribute of judgment is called angel in certain places in Scripture. It was this [attribute] which dwelled in the pillar of fire that went before them in the night to give them light. Therefore [Scripture] mentions [in this case] Elohim [the name that denotes the attribute of judgment]. It is pos- sible that [the word angel, ]t, in the expression T'rnhm 0tm] is not in the construct state [i.e., the angel of Elohim] but rather is in apposition [i.e., the angel who is Elohim].83 We see, therefore, that Nalhmanides rejects ibn Ezra's interpretation of the expression P'nrIn 1K~ as a reference to an angelic being because, in his opinion, it refers rather to one of the divine attributes, the attribute of judg- ment, the Shekhinah, also designated the Court of the Holy One, blessed be He, ri"~,in Sw iun nr,.84 Hence DPn'hn 1 E should be read in the appositive, i.e., the angel who is Elohim, and not in the constructive, i.e., the angel of Elohim,85 for here, as in several other contexts in Nal.hmanides' commen- 82.

The notion of the court of God has its origin in rabbinic 'aggadah. Cf. Genesis Rabbah 51:2 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 533); Exodus Rabbah 12:4. For Nalhmanides, as other kabbalists, the reference is to the Shekhinah, the attribute of judgment. Cf., e.g., Perush to Gen. 19:24, Exod. 13:21, Num. 15:25; Deut. 8:18. 85. Cf.

WOLFSON tary,86 the word angel denotes the last of the divine emanations, the Shekhi- nah, rather than some created entity, even if that entity be a separate intellect.87 When Scripture speaks of the pillar of fire that illuminated the way for the Israelites during the nighttime, it is referring to a physical mani- festation of this very attribute of God and not to some symbolic correlate. Analogously, the pillar of cloud which accompanied the people in the day- time refers to the divine attribute of mercy, the Holy One, blessed be He. This is made clear in Nalhmanides' commentary to Exod. 13:21, "The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day." They [the rabbis] have already said that in every place [in Scripture] that it says "And the Lord" ('im) it refers to God and His court (i1'n ni Kan).88 The Holy One, blessed be He [i.e., the masculine potency or the attribute of mercy], was with them in the daytime and His Court [i.e., the feminine potency or the attribute of judgment] in the night. Thus the explanation of the verse (rinan ruTs) is that God [literally, the Name, tvn, clearly a reference to the Tetragrammaton or the attribute of mercy]89 dwelled in the cloud and went before them in the day in the pillar of cloud, and in the night His Court dwelled in the pillar of fire to give them light. . . . In the first redemption the Holy One, blessed be He, was with them in the day and His Court was with them in the night, but in the future the attribute of His Court will ascend in mercy (D),n IT' n,' nrm aronn), and the Lord, i.e., the Tetragrammaton (rv "mnrn), will go before them..,. for the All [i.e., the Shekhinah]90 will be united with the attribute of mercy (n'fmt3 PT' nit r~r n ,).91 86. Cf. Perush to Gen. 18:1, to be discussed below. In several places the Shekhinah is also designated as the u, 1Kyb or a1T1, i~d; see Gen. 22:12, 48:15, Exod. 3:2, 12:12, 23:20, 24:1. In his commentary to Exod. 33:12 (p. 519) Nalhmanides refers to the Shekhinah as the "first angel" (paKln lKbe) in whom is the name of God (cf. Exod. 23:21), while in the commentary to Exod. 33:14 She is referred to, on the basis of Malachi 3:1, as the angel of the covenant (n'ni, 1"Kb). See below, nn. 99-100. 87. In several places NaIhmanides accepts the philosophical characterization of angels as separate intellects. Cf. Perush, Gen. 18:1; Num. 22:23, 23:4. 88. See n. 84. 89. Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 81; Recanati, Perush 'al ha-Torah, fol. 43a. 90. That the expression "the all," bn,, should be taken here as a technical term for the She- khinah (see below, n. 116), and should not be translated simply as "everything" (as has been rendered by Chavel in his English translation of Nahmanides' commentary, vol. 2, p. 179), is evident from the fact that the verb used is the feminine form, nrm',, rather than Imn, the mas- culine form required if the word ba, were to be taken in its normal sense. Cf. Be'ur le-Ferush ha-RaMBaN, fol. 13a; Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 81. 91. Perush, Exod. 13:21 (p. 348). For a discussion of this passage and its influence on the</page><page sequence="33">BY WAY OF TRUTH 135 The critical point is that this explanation of the biblical narrative concerning Israel's delivery from Egypt is not offered as a kabbalistic explanation supplementing another more literal one; it is indeed the very meaning of the text according to Nahmanides. Similarly, we find that in the end to the introduction to his Commentary on Job, after discussing various passages in Scripture which assume the pos- sibility that angels take the form of men when they appear to human beings, Nalmanides writes: "the matter is true and set according to its literal sense, established and standing according to its plain meaning; but there is a secret to the matter for the (mystical) tradition is the foundation of the true Torah," ,n'ln5 , 'i * n, V', "n? Dj?1 ~ ~ 'ri I np " i", o~, nmn',Im.92 In an obvious polemic against the philosophical view, espe- cially espoused by Maimonides, that the appearance of angels in human form in prophetic visions must be treated allegorically,93 Nahmanides is affirming the literal, factual objectivity of such appearances, but, he adds, to understand these actual events one must know about the kabbalistic secret. Although it is not specified in that context, from other contexts, especially his commentary to Gen. 18:1, it is clear that Nalmanides has in mind the esoteric doctrine of the garment, ti'b;, no.94 In the aforementioned context Nalmanides engages in a lengthy critique against Maimonides' view that every prophet, with the exception of Moses, received his prophecy through author of the Zohar, see E. Wolfson, "Left Contained in the Right: A Study in Zoharic Her- meneutics," AJS Review 11 (1986): 40-41. 92. Kitvei Ramban, 1:26. 93. See, e.g., Guide I, 49; II, 42. And cf. Teicher, "The Mediaeval Mind," p. 10. It must be said that on noetic grounds there is no difference between a prophetic vision and regular sense experience. On the contrary, as Maimonides states in Guide III, 24, one of the signs of genuine prophecy is that "all that is seen by the prophet in a vision of prophecy is, for the prophet, true and certain," for "the prophet has no doubts in any way concerning anything in it, and that, for him, its status is the same as that of all existing things that are apprehended through the senses or the intellect." It is nevertheless the case that Maimonides denies the facticity or objective pole of the images seen by the prophet. That is, the images seen by the prophet occur only with- in the prophet's mind, with no sense datum in the external world. Maimonides can thus contrast that which is and that which is apprehended in a prophetic state. In terms of this doc- trine Maimonides followed the view of Avicenna and not that of al-Farabi. See C. Sirat, Les Theories des visions surnaturelles dans la Pensee juive du Moyen Age (Leiden, 1969), p. 142. 94. Nahlmanides himself, as far as I am aware, does not use the expression Vl1ba, no, though he does use the word vin5h; see citation in n. 98.

Maimonides incorrectly identified prophecy with such visionary experiences. In the case of Scripture's relating that the angel appeared in anthropomorphic form, however, there is an esoteric matter that distinguishes such occurrences from all other angelic visions. In Nahmanides' words: "When [Scripture] mentions angels in the name of men96 . . . this [involves] the created Glory in [the form of] the angels, referred to by those who know as the garment, which is perceptible to the human eyes of those who are pure as the pious and the sons of the prophets, but I cannot explain," "n' an... .

Cf. Guide II, 41. And see Sirat, Les Thedries, pp. 147-149. 96. From Nahmanides' language, "when [Scripture] mentions angels in the name of men," some commentators have explained that he is essentially following Maimonides' view (cf. Mish- neh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah 2:7 that only angels from the group called DtVK could be seen by men. Cf. Meir Aldabi, Shevilei 'Emunah (Warsaw, 1887), fol. 13c; Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 49, and Meir ibn Gabbai, 'Avodat ha-Qodesh (Jerusalem, 1973), fol. 162b. See also Be'ur le-Ferush ha-RaMBaN 'al ha-Torah, fol. 5d. This interpretation has been recently re- iterated by Dorit Cohen-Alloro, The Secret of the Garment in the Zohar (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 30 [in Hebrew]. In fact, however, Nahmanides did not intend this at all. See Nahmanides' expli- cit critique of Maimonides' position in Kitvei Ramban 1:148. Nahmanides was rather speaking generally of the appearance of angels in anthropomorphic forms. That this generic explanation is correct may be proven by the fact that after the relevant remark Nahmanides cites several other examples, one with Lot (cf. Gen. 19:lff.) and two with Jacob (cf. Gen. 32:25 and 37:15), where the angels are in the form of a man, not specifically from the group of angels called 'tVt. See also Perush, Num. 22:23 (p. 291) where Nalmanides puts the matter as follows: DzK, 97.

On fol. 30b the view is cited in the name of the can that God makes a "garment" for his pious ones and at times they come to the world in order to act as God's messengers, i.e., Dt~K. Isaac of Acre reports the same view, in slightly different terminology, in the name of his teacher; see Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 48. See also MS Oxford 1943, fols. 20b-21b. Nahmanides himself briefly alludes to such a view in his commentary to Gen. 49:33 (pp. 276-277). Cf. also Bahya ben Asher, Kad ha-Qemah, in Kitvei Rabbenu Bahya, ed. Chavel (Jerusalem, 1970), p. 356. Nahlmanides' view on the 115b, if my interpretation is correct, should be distinguished from the view expressed many times in the zoharic corpus as well as in de Le6n's Hebrew theo- sophic texts regarding the angels being clothed in the form of mortal humans in their descent to the world. Nahmandes was interpreted in this way already by Moses de Le6n; see The Book of the Pomegranate.: Moses de Ledn's Sefer ha-Rimmon, ed. E. Wolfson, p. 316, and references to the Zohar in n. 22 ad loc. (Hebrew section). See also Menahem Recanati, Perush 'al ha-Torah, fols. 24a-b, who combined the two traditions. For a fuller discussion of the zoharic view, see Cohen-Alloro, The Secret of the Garment in the Zohar, pp. 26-44. 100. The term "created Glory" is traceable to Saadya Gaon, where it refers to a created material light, superior to the angels, that appears in various forms to man. See The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, trans. by S. Rosenblatt (New Haven, 1948), pp. 130, 151 ff.; Saadya's Commentary to Genesis, ed. by M. Zucker (New York, 1984), p. 9 (Hebrew translation, pp. 175-176); Judah ben Barzilai, Perush Sefer YeSirah, ed. S. J. Halberstam (Berlin, 1885), pp. 31 ff., 234-235; A. Altmann, Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism (Ithaca, 1969), pp. 152-155. And see, in particular, the language of the responsum of Saadya to a certain heretic (cf. I. Davidson, The Book of the Wars of the Lord [New York, 1934], pp. 25-26, who identifies the heretic as Salman ben Yeruham, also known as Ibn Sakawaihi; see however J. Mann, Texts and Studies in Jewish History and Literature [Philadelphia, 1935], 2:1469-70), preserved in Hebrew translation in Judah ben Barzilai's Perush Sefer YeSirah, p. 21: "Every angel and every form is a created light . . . and the Holy One, blessed be He, created it for His Glory," 1Kt IR rnin5 ,l"*, Kt1 ... ,Kn "11K 'Ix r 1. In that context Saadya makes a distinction between two aspects of the Glory: the lower aspect is the created light which is seen by human beings, both prophets and saints, whereas the higher aspect, although also a created light, is only appre- hended by the angels. While the former aspect of the Glory is connected with the visionary experience of angels, the latter is connected specifically with the object of mystical vision in the Shi'ur Qomah text. Cf. Dan, Torat ha-Sod shel Iasidut 'Ashkenaz, pp. 109-111, and idem, "Kavod Nistar," in Da'at we-Safah, ed. by M. Hallamish and A. Kasher (Jerusalem, 1981), pp. 73-76. Judah ha-Levi and Maimonides likewise identified the Shekhinah with the created Glory that was seen by the prophets; see Kuzari IV, 3 (cf. H. Wolfson, Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion [Cambridge, 1977], 2:93; Efros, Studies in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, p. 152, n. 50; Y. Silman, Thinker and Seer: The Development of the Thought of R. Yehuda Halevi in the Kuzari (Bar Ilan, 1985), p. 178, n. 40 [in Hebrew]); Guide I, 11, 25, 46, and 64. For Nab- manides, in contrast to Saadya, ha-Levi, and Maimonides, the created Glory is not really a created entity at all, but is rather the manifestation of the divine, the last of the emanations. See</page><page sequence="36">138 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON already seen, the word 1K on occasion designates the divine attribute of judgment, the Shekhinah, in Nalhmanides' kabbalah. What is relevant for my purposes is the fact that for Nalhmanides, the literal-factual meaning of in particular Nahmanides' criticism of Maimonides' position in his commentary to Gen. 46:1 (pp. 250-251): "God forbid that the thing which is called Shekhinah or created Glory is some- thing distinct from God, blessed be He, as the rabbi [i.e., Maimondes] thought here.... And Jonathan ben Uziel translated [Ezek. 3:12, 'Blessed be the Glory from His place'] 'Blessed be the Glory of the Lord from the place of the inhabitation of the Shekhinah' (n,' "rsx 'rnr x'- ,'' rn'mvt). If by the [word] glory Scripture here intends the essence and truth of the Creator... behold it says 'place' and 'habitation of the Shekhinah'. And if you say that the created Glory is like the view of the rabbi . . . how can the [word] blessed be established [in the verse 'Blessed be the Glory of God from its place'], for the one who blesses and prays to the created Glory [understood, that is, in the Maimonidean sense] is like one who worships idols. In the words of the rabbis there are many things that show that the Shekhinah is God, blessed be He." In other words, for Nahmanides, the Glory is distinct from the infinite Godhead (what he refers to as the Creator in His essence and truth) but yet is not something created or distinct from God. Cf. Isaac of Acre, 'OSar Hayyim, MS Guenzberg 775, fols. 13a, 16b, who distinguishes between the xm "m,,a, i.e., an angel, and the 'xo nTu, i.e., the divine attribute. Nahlmanides' conception has great affinity with that of the German Pietists, particularly from the main school of Judah he-Hasid and Eleazar of Worms. See Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 111-113, and Dan, Torat ha-Sod shel .Hasidut 'Ashkenaz, pp. 104-170. See, in particular, the following passage in Eleazar of Worms, Sefer ha-Shem, MS British Museum 737, fol. 223a: "It is customary for God to clothe the thoughts of His decrees, to show [them] to the prophets so that they will know that God has set His decrees. The prophet knows His thoughts according to the vision that he sees. At times this vision is called an angel." Cf. idem, Sodei Razaya, ed. I. Kamelhar (Bilgraj, 1936), pp. 3-4, 7-8, 11, 34-35, 51-52. And cf. the text from Sefer ha-Hayyim cited in Dan, op. cit., pp. 151-152. The similarity between Nahlmanides' discussion of the secret of the garment and the view of R. Eleazar of Worms was already noted by I. Kamelhar, Rabbenu Eleazar Mi-Germaiza ha-Roqeah (New York, 1930), p. 52. Mention should also be made of the view expressed in the early Provengal document published by Scholem, "Traces of Gabirol in the Kabbalah," Me'assefSofrei 'Erev Yisra'el, ed. A. Kabak and A. Steinman (Tel-Aviv, 1940), pp. 175-176 [in Hebrew], and in English translation in Origins of the Kabbalah, p. 225. In that text a tradition is recorded according to which the tenth sefirah is described as the angelic Prince of the Divine Countenance or Prince of the World who speaks to prophets in God's name. See Septimus, Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition, p. 167, n. 14. On the kabbalistic identification of Shekhinah with Metatron, see below, n. 217. Cf. also S. Pines, "God, the Divine Glory and the Angels according to a Second-Century Theology," in "Proceedings of the Second International Conference on the History of Jewish Mysticism," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 6 (1987): 11-12 [in Hebrew]. Pines argues that Nahlmanides' conception of the kavod as that which is not distinct from God but yet appears to men in various forms is an echo of a presumably Jewish tradition reported by Justin Martyr (110-165). Curiously, Pines does not mention Nahmanides' doctrine of the malbush in his commentary to Gen. 18:1 which brings his position even closer to that reported by Justin, for according to that tradition the glory, which is not separate from God, appears to men in the form of angels. This is precisely the essence of Nahlmanides' esoteric doctrine of the malbush.</page><page sequence="37">BY WAY OF TRUTH 139 these narratives is only upheld by the kabbalistic explanation.'0 In that sense one can speak assuredly of a convergence of peshat and sod. The passage wherein this convergence is most clearly expressed occurs in Nalhmanides' commentary to the dialogue between Moses and God after the sin of the Golden Calf in Exod. 33:12 ff. After reviewing the interpretations of Rashi and ibn Ezra, Nahlmanides forthrightly proclaims: This section [of Scripture] cannot possibly be explained (ni~in)'102 to one who has not heard the secrets of the Torah (nllnn 'rno). And thus is the matter according to the way of truth: Moses said, "You have not made known to me whom You will send with me" (Exod. 33:12). He requested that two things which [God] said to him be fulfilled. Firstly, "I [God] have singled you [Moses] out by name" (ibid.), i.e., the I [God] will be known by My name on your behalf. ... And secondly [Moses was told by God] "you have, indeed, gained favor in My eyes" (ibid.), i.e., [Moses] will find grace, which is the cleaving of knowledge (nrt nip2n). And [Moses said to God] "Now if I have truly found favor in Your eyes" (ibid. 13), [i.e.,] through the attribute ofjudg- ment (pm nvma), [then] "pray let me know" the paths of the ways through which You are known by Your name (?l]v 9 rm "K lK Po' K rln ninm). "And I will know You" (ibid.), [i.e.,] to unify You "so that I may find" the great grace ('nran Inj). "Consider, too, that this nation is Your people" (ibid.). You are their father and they are Your children. .... Then the Holy One, blessed be He, answered Moses, "My face will go" (ibid. 14), [i.e.,] "the angel of the cove- nant (ninan 10) that you desire" (Malachi 3:1), for My face is seen in him... "for My name is in him" (Exod. 23:21). "And I will lighten your burden" (ibid. 33:14) ... that he [the angel of the covenant or the Shekhinah] should not conduct himself in relation to you with the attribute of severe judgment (mY In- np, ), but rather with the attribute [of judgment] contained in the attribute of mercy (a,rln nrin a;i'i nun). . . . Then Moses responded, "Unless Your face"-[i.e.,] by Yourself and Your Glory (1nlum b ~i~a)-go in the lead, do not make us leave this place" (ibid. 15), for You must be with us face to face. .... Thus it is mentioned above, "[Your people whom You deliv- 101. The point is well made by BaIhya ben Asher in his commentary to Gen. 18:8 (p. 172): "This section cannot be taught to any intelligent person except by way of the kabbalistic explanation, for the meaning of these angels, referred to as human beings, is that the created Glory [is embodied] in the angels, and the true enlightened ones call this [phenomenon] the garment." 102. For this usage, see A. Even-Shohan, Ha-Millon he-.Hadash (Jerusalem, 1969), 1:272, s.v. n,.</page><page sequence="38">140 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON ered from the land of Egypt] with great power and with a mighty hand" (ibid. 32:11). Thus [Moses] requested that [God] bring them to the land "with great power and with a mighty hand" (pjtn r" i 511' n) just as He brought them forth from Egypt.'?3 Moses' request to God, and God's answer to Moses, can only be under- stood, according to Nahmanides, in terms of the theosophic dynamic of the divine attributes. Moses wanted assurance from God that the attribute of judgment, Shekhinah, would lead the people through the desert, but only as it is comprised within, or mitigated by, the attribute of mercy. This is the mystery of the angel of the covenant (Shekhinah) in whom is found the name of God (the Tetragrammaton, which symbolizes the masculine potency). It is also the meaning of God's telling Moses that His face would lead the people, for the face refers to God's attribute of judgment, Shekhinah, but only as it is turned toward the other divine face, the attribute of mercy, the Holy One, blessed be He.'04 The union of these attributes is finally alluded to in the expression "with great power and with a mighty hand" ('Ti 51~r no' rprn), i.e., the former symbolizing the attribute of mercy and the latter the attribute of judgment. Just as the deliverance from Egypt was realized through the combination of these two attributes, so too the entry into the land. In Nal.manides view, then, the biblical text is incomprehensible to one who lacks knowledge of the secrets of Torah, i.e., knowledge of the proper kabbalistic symbolism. One who has such theosophic knowledge, however, understands the text in its plain sense. Some final examples of the first typology. Commenting on Jacob's utterance in Gen. 31:42, "and the Fear of Isaac (pn, "ni) was with me," Nahlmanides writes: By way of truth the verse will be explained in its plain and literal sense (ia' 13twb7? telDE pTbV'), and it [pnt, ~np] refers to the supernal attribute of judg- ment [i.e., the fifth emanation, Gevurah or Din]. Concerning it it is written, "Afterward, the Israelites will turn back and will seek the Lord their God and David their king, and they will thrill (rnnl) over the Lord and His bounty in the days to come" (Hosea 3:5). That is, they will seek [the attribute of] mercy 103. Perush, Exod. 33:14 (pp. 520-521). This text was adduced already by Septimus; see above, n. 74. 104. Cf. Perush, Gen. 32:2; Exod. 3:2, 20:3, 23:16, 25:30; Lev. 20:3; Num. 15:25; Deut. 4:32.</page><page sequence="39">BY WAY OF TRUTH 141 [the Tetragrammaton] and the lower attribute of judgment [David their king] and they will bring the Fear of Isaac [reading nn~i as a noun, i.e., His Fear, rather than as a verb] to God and to His goodness (i" 'it ovin 'a) which were mentioned.'05 The most desirable explanation for the biblical expression, indeed the one that best suits the plain sense, is that which decodes the text as a symbolic reference to the divine attribute, for indeed the expression pn, "nc is used in Scripture as a proper name of God, i.e., the "One whom Isaac feared," which parallels the words that proceed it, "God of my father, the God of Abraham." Using the same kabbalistic motif Nahmanides accounts for the plain sense of Gen. 46:1, where it is stated that Jacob "offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac," pn, iu 'iN , o r,'nal nal,. According to Nalh- manides, the last three words in the verse refer to the attribute of judgment, which was the divine grade especially connected to Isaac. Jacob saw fit to offer sacrifices to this particular attribute because he realized that his jour- ney to Egypt was the beginning of exile, a period when the forces of judgment would prevail. To mitigate that somewhat he thought it appro- priate to offer sacrifices to the attribute of judgment, "the God of his father Isaac." The plain sense is therefore completely informed by the mystical nuance. In a similar fashion Nahlmanides reads the events at the Sinaitic revela- tion purely in terms of a theosophic process-the merging of the attributes of mercy and judgment symbolized as the voice speaking through the fire- for the theophany is explicable on only one level.'06 The decoding of Scrip- 105. Perush. Gen. 31:42 (p. 178). Again, this is one of the examples mentioned by Septimus; see n. 103. 106. Cf. Perush, Gen. 15:1; Exod. 19:3, 20; Deut. 4:12, 32; 5:5, 19. Cf. Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 102: "Even though from what is apparent (,mnan, T) it seems that [Na.hmanides] did not mention this [explanation] here by any allusion to esoteric truth (nt'e rnrin Tat "~51n K' -io), and he said the matter ... [in a way] that one who sees them thinks that the rabbi [Nalh- manides] did not pay attention to them. Yet, all his intention was dependent on them, to allude through them to the wonderful and hidden secrets. Know that if one desires the words of the rabbi then one will find the external [sense] to be 'silver showpieces' ('0i m,',n), and if one's heart is burning and inflamed with regard to their inner [sense] then one will find 'apples of gold' ('~ ,m'rn)." The latter reference is, of course, to Prov. 25:11, the verse which Maimonides, in the introduction to the Guide, used to express the inner (balin)-outer (Tahir), esoteric- exoteric polarity in the text. Cf. Talmage, "Apples of Gold," p. 315.</page><page sequence="40">142 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON ture as a map of kabbalistic symbols alone provides the reader with a proper understanding of the text. Similarly, Nalhmanides interprets Exod. 14:31, "And Israel saw the great hand (narTn Tr'r)," as a reference to the attribute of judgment (pi", n Tr) or Shekhinah.'07 Although this interpretation is designat- ed as the esoteric one (naK Tpf ), Nahlmanides does not offer an alterna- tive reading which he finds satisfactory. The same may be said with respect to his understanding of Moses' question in Exod. 3:13, "what is his name," Inw ;m. There is, for Nahmanides, only one way to understand this text, and that is in terms of the kabbalistic system of divine emanations.'08 Indeed, in many instances Nalhmanides' treatment of the divine names in Scripture- especially YHWH (referred to as iionr ot or ~Tan or orTmn'?r t) and Elohim (Tran tw)-betrays this convergence of literal and esoteric, for the names cannot by their very nature be taken in any other way except as refer- ring to the respective attributes of God.1'09 To cite but one salient example of this. In his commentary to Exod. 6:2 Nalhmanides writes: By way of truth the verse is explained according to its simple and literal sense (lun3 l tler v ~inn a n ~ma 1 5'1i), for it says, "I am the Lord" [i.e.,] I appeared to them through the speculum of El Shaddai [i.e., the Shekhinah, the feminine potency]. .. but I the Lord [i.e., the Tetragrammaton or the Holy One, blessed be He, the masculine potency] was not known to them, for they did not gaze upon the speculum that shines [the masculine potency]. .... the Patriarchs did know the Unique Name [tm,n oi, the Tetragrammaton], but it was not known to them through prophecy.... The Patriarchs had a revelation of Shekhinah, and the [divine] speech was [communicated] through the weaker attribute of judgment .... But Moses knew [the divine] through the attribute of mercy, which is the Great Name [the Tetragrammaton]."o 2. Let me now turn my attention to the second typology concerning the convergence of sod and peshat in Nahmanides. In some of the contexts in Nahlmanides' commentary where peshat and sod seem to be equated, the two are, in fact, distinct but parallel layers of meaning. I have already touched 107. Perush, Exod. 14:31; and cf. to Deut. 5:15. 108. This example was mentioned by Septimus; see reference above, n. 74. Cf. R. Ezra, Perush 'al Shir ha-Shirim, Kitvei Ramban, 2:477-478. 109. See e.g., Perush to Gen. 11:2, 17:1, 18:20, 19:24, 22:2, 46:1, 48:15; Exod. 2:25, 6:2, 13:16, 15:2, 19:3, 19:20, 20:2, 32:10, 11; Lev. 18:2, 19:12; Num. 6:24, 15:25, 20:1, 23:16; Deut. 3:25, 4:12, 21, 32, 8:18.

Perush, Exod. 6:2 (p. 304); mentioned by both Septimus and Berger (see nn. 74-75).</page><page sequence="41">BY WAY OF TRUTH 143 upon the phenomenon of parallelism and its centrality in Nahmanides' kab- balistic hermeneutics in the first section of this paper. The crucial point to emphasize here is that occasionally Nahlmanides will argue that it is only through knowledge of the parallel event in the divine realm that one can truly understand the literal or contextual meaning of the text."' It is nevertheless the case that in these instances two levels of meaning, the literal and mystical, are preserved, which do refer to two levels of reality outside the text, the mundane and the divine. To be sure, comprehension of the literal sense is ultimately dependent upon comprehension of the mystical sense, in the same way that a full appreciation of the lower world is depen- dent upon adequate knowledge of the upper world. In these cases, however, the two levels of meaning in the realm of exegesis are parallel, not identical. Thus, for example, the following kabbalistic explanation is given as the plain meaning of "And when you sound short blasts (,ninn Dn~prn) a second time those encamped on the south shall move forward. ... While to con- voke the congregation you shall blow long blasts, not short ones (xh ispnn iun)" (Num. 10:6-7): the short blast (,amin) alludes to or symbolizes (tmi) the attribute of judgment, i.e., the Shekhinah, whereas the long or extended blast (n~'pn) symbolizes the attribute of mercy, i.e., Tif'eret."2 Although in this case the peshat of the text requires knowledge of the theosophic process, it is not Nalhmanides' intention to negate the literal sense. On the contrary, he upholds the literal sense of the narrative, thereby maintaining that Moses actually took the silver trumpets and made the appropriate sounds. These latter, however, symbolically corresponded to attributes within the divine realm, and hence the full meaning of the scriptural text-i.e., why these sounds were commanded and not others-can only be ascertained by kab- balistic knowledge of the theosophic realm. The peshat in the text, cor- responding to an event in the mundane world, refers to a kabbalistic paral- lel, a sod, in the divine world. Here the overlapping of literal and mystical does not imply identification of the two, but only parallelism. In his commentary to Num. 15:31 Nahmanides rejects Rashi's numero- logical explanation for why the fringe garment is considered by Scripture to be a memorial (pi'T) for all the commandments."3 According to Rashi's II I. See, e.g., Perush, Exod. 20:3; Num. 4:20. 112. Perush, Num. 10:6; and cf. to Lev. 23:24. 113.

Touati [Louvain, 1980], pp. 183-189). This numerology was clearly intended to be a support (xrNeox) for the talmudic dictum that the commandment of the fringe garment is equivalent to all the other commandments. See b. Menahlot 43b, Nedarim 25b, Shevu'ot 29a. For an interesting parallel to this theme in Samari- tan literature, see A. Loewenstamm, "On the Problem of 613 Commandments in Samaritan- ism," Tarbiz 41 (1972): 310-312 [in Hebrew]. For an alternative computation intended to link the 613 commandments to the one commandment of the fringe garment, see R. Ezra, Perush 'al Shir ha-Shirim, Kitvei Ramban, 2:496. R.

It is thus on account of the symbolic reference-and not the numerological value-that the sisit serve as a token of memorial for all 613 commandments. This view is presented by Nah.manides without any special introduction, as if it were-as indeed in his mind it is-the peshat of the verse.120 The literal sense of the words "look at it and recall all the commandments" is informed by the kabbalistic understanding of the word "all," whose symbolic valence is identical to that of the blue thread mentioned in the previous verse (Num. 15:38), i.e., the "all" is the Shekhinah which comprises within itself all the commandments and is symbolized by the blue thread. The import of the proclamation, "look at it," is thus to look specifically at the blue thread, for it is in virtue of the latter that one is reminded of the divine potency referred to as the "all" in the remainder of the verse. Here the convergence 1879), fol. 6a. Nah.manides' explanation had a decisive influence on subsequent kabbalists, including Moses de Le6n. See Wolfson, The Book of the Pomegranate, p. 234 (Hebrew section) and discussion on p. 19 (English section). On the kabbalistic identification of Shekhinah with miswah, a theme that is expressed already in Sefer ha-Bahir, see references given in Wolfson, op. cit., p. 18, n. 35, and see pp. 59-61. 119. Cf. C. Henoch, Ha-Ramban ke-loqer u-khe-Mequbbal, pp. 346-350. 120. Cf. J. Katz, Halakhah we-Qabbalah, p. 31. In yet another context, in his commentary to Lev. 19:19 (p. 120), Nah.manides takes issue with Rashi's claim that huqim represent divine decrees for which there is no reason. "The statutes of the Holy One, blessed be He (T"~pin ,pin)," counters Nahmanides, "are His secrets (neno) in the Torah, which the people do not appreciate [literally, enjoy, 'nm] through their thinking as they do in the case of mishpatim, but yet they all have a proper reason (po] 3t0) and a perfect benefit (n~5rv nSman)." Cf. Henoch, Ha-Ramban ke-.Hoqer u-khe-Mequbbal, pp. 386-394. The specific rationale adduced for the prohibition of mixed species (kil'ayim) is that all vegetative and animal forces below are generated by powers that have their origin in the supernal realm; therefore by combining two different species one "changes and defies the work of Creation." Cf. R. Ezra, Perush 'al Shir ha-Shirim, Kitvei Ram- ban, 2:544. It is interesting to note that Moses de Le6n employs the Geronese formulation but transforms it in light of the Castilian doctrine of dual forces, i.e., the prohibition of mixing the species is construed as the prohibition of mixing the divine and the demonic. See E. Wolfson, The Book of the Pomegranate, p. 41, n. 149 (English section). (The reference there to Nal- manides' commentary on Lev. 19:9 should be corrected to Lev. 19:19). The critical point in this case, however, is even though Nahlmanides insists that the particular biblical injunction can only be understood in light of the kabbalistic rationale, the latter is in no way connected to a particular term in the text and therefore cannot count as an example of the identity or con- vergence of sod and peshat in the realm of exegesis. The formulation of this last point is based on a comment of David Berger to the author.</page><page sequence="44">146 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON of meaning between peshat and sod is made possible by the fact that the blue thread in Scripture has a twofold connotation: it refers to both the actual thread and to the symbolic correlate in the divine world. The full sense of the biblical description of the former can only be gained by knowledge of the latter. To take another set of examples that will illustrate my point. Nah- manides clearly states that with respect to various items in the Tabernacle, including the "bread of display" (no', nn') set on a table as well as the candelabrum (11m), these phenomena can only be understood by reference to the supernal events which they symbolize.'2' In his commentary to Exod. 25:24, "and make a gold moulding around [the table]," Nalmanides cites Rashi's explanation, which is itself based on earlier midrashic sources,122 that the table is a "sign of the crown of royalty," mrn irne tno. In these words Nalmanides finds a symbolic reference to the last sefirah, the Shekhinah, which he himself describes as "the secret of the table" (tn'~vr n ) upon which the supernal blessing rests.'23 Thus the full comprehension of the literal sense of the words "make a gold moulding around [the table]" is predicated upon an understanding of the kabbalistic symbolism. Although the kabbalistic interpretation does not in this case address a problem that emerges from a straightforward reading of the text, insofar as the sod illu- minates the peshat in such a way that the latter is not understood adequate- ly except by means of the former, it is correct, in my opinion, to speak of an overlapping of the two levels of meaning. Particularly interesting in this regard are Nalmanides' comments on the structure of the cherubim. According to Nahmanides, the cherubim were constructed "with their wings spread out above, shielding the cover with their wings" (cf. Exod. 25:20), for they actually formed the Throne-seat 121. Perush, Exod. 25:30 (p. 463). This kabbalistic orientation is, of course, related to a much older aggadic motif regarding the parallel structure between the terrestrial and celestial Temples. Cf. the comprehensive study of V. Aptowitzer, "The Heavenly Temple in the Aggadah," Tarbiz 2 (1931): 137-153, 257-285 [in Hebrew]. 122. Cf. Exodus Rabbah 34:2; Tanhuma, Vayaqhel, 8; Numbers Rabbah 4:13, 14:10. For a slightly different formulation, but one which expresses the same idea, see b.

"Therefore [God] was called '[the one] enthroned on the cherubim,'"24 for they spread out their wings to show that they are the chariot to carry the Glory (n1s, ,atl ,ivmm, otv) .... And if you consider further why they were facing one another (ibid.), and why they were of 'hammered work' (ibid. 18), you will know that it was appropriate for them to have 'their wings spread out above,' for they are the supreme Throne, shielding the Testimony [i.e., the Tablets of Law] which is the 'writ- ing of God' (cf. ibid. 32:16).'"25 Moreover, according to Nalimanides, the structure of the Ark and cherubim in the Tabernacle was identical to that of the chariot seen by Ezekiel, described by the prophet in one place in the fol- lowing way: "This is the living creature that I had seen below the God of Israel at the River Chebar, so now I know that they were cherubim" (Ezek. 10:20). The cherubim of the chariot seen by Ezekiel, in turn, were in the image of the higher Cherubim in the divine realm: "And this is the meaning of [the expression] 'the figure of the chariot' (1 Chron. 28:18), for the cheru- bim carrying the Glory which Ezekiel saw are the figure [or pattern] of the Cherubim which are the Glory and the Splendor (rirKDn "n ) [i.e., the sixth and tenth sefirot, Shekhinah and Tif'eret],126 and the cherubim in the Taber- nacle and in the Temple were in their pattern." Proper knowledge of the structure of the cherubim described by Scripture can only be gained, there- fore, by reference to the symbolic correlate of these cherubim in the divine realm. This does not, however, imply that there were no actual cherubim in the Tabernacle or the Temple. The literal sense of the text describing these 124. Cf. 1.

Mettinger, The Dethronement of Sabaoth: Studies in the Shem and Kabod Theologies (Coniectanea Biblica, Old Testament Series 18, 1982), pp. 19-24. 126. Cf. Perush, Num. 11:15, and see Racanati, Perush 'al ha-Torah, Exod. 25:10, fol. 49b: "There are those who explain that the cherubim allude to [or symbolize: oTln] the du-parwufin [i.e., Tif'eret and Shekhinah], and this appears to be the opinion of the RaMBaN, blessed be his memory." For other Geronese kabbalists the cherubim were said to symbolize Hesed and Gevurah,; see Tishby, Perush ha-'Aggadot le-R. 'Azri'el, p. 11, n. 1. For still other kabbalists, such as Joseph Hamadan, who wrote in the last decade of the thirteenth century, the cherubim symbolized Yesod and Shekhinah. Cf. Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, p. 134. And see Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 121, who reports having received a tradition similar to that of Joseph Hamadan in the name of an anonymous "enlightened kabbalist" (rpav kni@). On p. 123, however, R. Isaac follows the tradition of Nah.manides and identifies the symbolic cor- respondence of the cherubim as the du-parSufin, i.e., Tiferet and Shekhinah.</page><page sequence="46">148 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON entities has the mundane realities as its referent, whereas the symbolic sense has the divine realities as its referent. A striking example of this parallelism is to be found in Nalhmanides' interpretation of Moses' and Aaron's sin recorded in Num. 20:1 ff. After reviewing various prior attempts to explain the exact nature of their sin, Nahmanides relates that herein is contained "one of the great secrets amongst the mysteries of the Torah."'27 An examination of the esoteric explanation that he offers shows indeed that this explanation alone focuses on the plain language of the text. In particular, Nahmanides' kabbalistic explanation deals with the seemingly innocuous detail of Scripture that Moses and Aaron hit the rock twice (cf. Num. 20:11). This act epitomizes, according to Nahlmanides, the essence of their sinfulness, for it represented a lack of faith in God or, when understood in terms of kabbalistic symbols, a lack of faith in the unity of the two aspects of God that corresponds to faith. Nalhmanides explains that the first time that Moses was commanded to draw water forth from the rock, God said to him, "I will be standing there before you on the rock at Horeb, and you should strike the rock" (Exod. 17:6). The esoteric meaning of that verse, writes Nahlmanides, is: "My Great Name (rnri ,v) was upon the rock at Horeb, which is 'the Glory of the Lord, a consuming fire on the top of the mountain' (ibid. 24:17).'"28 That is to say, at that moment it was clear to Moses that there was complete unifica- tion above between the masculine aspect of God, the attribute of mercy symbolized by the "Great Name" ('ira, ow), and the feminine aspect, the divine Glory (mrr ";23), the attribute of judgment symbolized alternatively as the rock or the consuming fire. Insofar as Moses was cognizant of this unity, he only hit the rock once, an act which symbolized that the two divine aspects were united. On the second occasion, however, Moses and Aaron were doubtful about this unification and they therefore hit the rock twice- one strike for each aspect-in order to bring about the unification so that the miracle would occur and the water would overflow from the rock. The double striking thus represents their lack of faith in God, which is to say, their lack of trust that the two divine grades were indeed united. In Nah- manides' words: "Both [Moses and Aaron] agreed to strike the rock twice and this was the sin. Therefore it says, 'You did not trust me,' ,Pn~on x) 127. Perush, Num. 20:1 (p. 276); mentioned by Septimus and Berger (see nn. 74-75). 128. Ibid.</page><page sequence="47">BY WAY OF TRUTH 149 (Num. 20:12), i.e., you did not place Faith, mint [the Shekhinah or feminine aspect] in My Name, ,bv [the masculine aspect] and by means of Faith the miracle would occur."''29 The event below therefore directly corresponded to the theosophic process above, for the rock on the mountain symbolized the Shekhinah, and Moses' or Aaron's double hitting of that rock reflects the failure to acknowledge the interrelatedness of the two divine potencies. In essence, then, their sin was a sin of misconception, referred to in Scripture as a rebellion (r'oo), directed particularly at the last of the divine grades, the Shekhinah.'30 "It says, 'you disobeyed My command,' ,e rnn, (Num. 27:14), for 'they rebelled against His holy spirit,' Tiwr m ni nr 1~ (Isa. 63:10), [the holy spirit] is called the mouth of the Lord [i.e., the Shekhinah] in every place."'3' Hence, in this case Nahmanides does not establish any theurgical connection between human action and the divine reality, but rather a sym- bolic affinity such that one's belief in God-understood in the dynamic cate- gories of the kabbalah-can be ascertained from one's action. It is in this sense that the literal meaning can only be gathered in light of the appro- priate kabbalistic symbolism. Another clear example of this overlapping of literal and esoteric is to be found in Nahlmanides' commentary to Deut. 32:7: "The explanation for this, as is stated, 'these the Lord God allotted to other people' (Deut. 4:19), since for each portion below there is a [corresponding] portion above. And the meaning of '[He fixed the boundaries of peoples] in relation to Israel's numbers' (Deut. 32:8), for the form of Jacob is carved on the Throne of Glory. This is a great secret."'32 For Nahmanides, then, one can understand Israel's chosenness only when one bears in mind the grade above to which Israel corresponds, viz., the central sefirah of Tif'eret, which is depicted in terms of the old aggadic image of the form of Jacob carved on the divine Throne.'33 More specifically, this image conveys in kabbalistic terms the 129.

WOLFSON unity of the masculine and feminine aspects of divinity, the image of Jacob (the masculine) engraved on the Throne (the feminine). Nahmanides utilizes this aggadic image to characterize the special divine providence that pertains to the land of Israel. Thus in his commentary to Gen. 33:20 he writes: By way of truth it is like the midrash of our rabbis who explained in the trac- tate Megillah [18a], "from where do you know that the Holy One, blessed be He, called Jacob 'Lord' (), as it says, 'And he [God] called him [Jacob] Lord, God of Israel' (biatv' ',I N)." There is in this matter a great secret, mentioned as well in Genesis Rabbah [79:8] in different language: He said to him, "You are Lord amongst the upper ones and I am Lord amongst the lower ones." They alluded to what they always say regarding the image of Jacob that is engraved on the Throne of Glory. And the intention is that the Shekhinah rests in the land of Israel. The enlightened one will understand.'34 The only way to comprehend Nal.manides' juxtaposing of these two rab- binic passages is to consider carefully the reading of Gen. 33:20 offered in b. Megillah 18a: "He, the God of Israel, called him [Jacob] Lord." Understood kabbalistically, the Lord of Israel, who addresses Jacob with the title 'K, is the Shekhinah. Jacob is so addressed by the Shekhinah because he reflects the corresponding divine attribute above, viz., the attribute of mercy. Nali- manides applies this kabbalistic symbolism as well to read the passage from Genesis Rabbah, i.e., the Shekhinah addresses Jacob: "You are the Lord above and I am the Lord below." The grade to which Jacob refers has domi- nion over the sefirotic realm, whereas Shekhinah has dominion over the mundane realm. The latter is expressed by the rabbinic idea that Shekhinah dwells in the land of Israel. Yet, providence in the land of Israel is of a spe- cial sort, for it eventuates from the union of the masculine and feminine potencies of the divine. This union is conveyed by the image of the form Qf Jacob engraved on the Throne as well as by Nakhmanides' kabbalistic read- ing of the two rabbinic texts.'35 134. Perush, Gen. 33:20 (p. 189). 135. See Be'ur le-Ferush ha-RaMBaN fol. 7b; Recanati, Perush 'al ha-Torah, fols. 31d-32a; Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 62. In the commentary attributed to ibn Sahula a second explanation is given whereby Jacob, or Tiferet, is identified with the throne itself, but this does not imply any feminine image of Jacob, for a distinction is made there between a higher and lower Throne, referring respectively to the masculine and feminine potencies of God. Cf. the anonymous commentary on the sefirot in MS JTS 8124, fol. 5a: "Tiferet is the</page><page sequence="49">BY WAY OF TRUTH 151 It is of interest that Nalhmanides uses this very mystical notion to explain the plain meaning of Lev. 18:25,where the punishment for sexual offenses is expulsion from the land of Israel. Nahmanides poses the obvious question: If these laws pertaining to forbidden sexual relations are bodily obligations that are not dependent on the land of Israel for their fulfillment, why then does Scripture connect the two with respect to punishment? Nathmanides answers by showing that the underlying rationale for these sexual prohibi- tions is connected to the special holiness of the Jewish people, which, in turn, is related specifically to their being in the land of Israel.136 All other nations are ruled by celestial forces in their lands, but Israel is ruled only by God in the land of Israel. Na1hmanides further specifies that although out- side the land of Israel the celestial forces have dominion, even these forces derive their power from the Shekhinah, referred to as the "Trn ow. In the case of the land of Israel, however, the Shekhinah is united with Tif'eret, and hence Her dominion over the land is qualitatively different. This is alluded to in Nahmanides' comment: "The honorable name [Shekhinah] is 'the God of gods and the Lord of lords' (Deut. 10:17) for all the world, but the land of Israel is the center of the settlement. It is the portion of God, unique to His Name (vblr nrmm,' 'in 'lmrn)."''37 In the last words there is an obvious reference to the masculine potency of the divine, the "mwrn rw.'38 The land of Israel is thus the unique portion of God, for it symbolizes the feminine potency, the Shekhinah, which is here most fully united with the masculine potency. The sins of sexual promiscuity affect the unity of masculine and feminine forces that is realized within the geographical boundaries of Israel. attribute of truith . . . and it is called the Throne. .. . And thus Jacob is [the attribute of] truth, and he is called the Throne of Glory. Therefore it is said that the form of Jacob is engraved on the Throne of Glory." See also Zohar 2: 242a. 136. According to Nahmanides, the special holiness of the land of Israel is connected par- ticularly to the fact that in this geographical place all the commandments can be most properly fulfilled. Cf. C.D. Chavel, Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Jerusalem, 1967), p. 166 [in Hebrew]; Henoch, Ha-Ramban ke-Iloqer u-khe-Mequbbal, pp. 149-154. See n. 139. With respect to this idea of a "mystical geography" Nahlmanides shares much in common with Judah ha-Levi; cf. Silman, Thinker and Seer, pp. 138-141; S. Rosenberg, "The Link to the Land of Israel in Jewish Thought," in L. Hoffman, ed., The Land of Israel: Jewish Perspectives (Notre Dame, 1986), pp. 148-156. 137. See the exact parallel in Nalhmanides' sermon for Rosh Hashanah, in Kitvei Ramban, 1:250. In that context Nabmanides adds that in the land of Israel the Jewish people will be "especially united with His Name that is there," n' ?nv o'*mn, n'mi. Cf. Zohar 1:108b. 138.

WOLFSON There is thus a deep mystical connection between the laws of 'arayot and the holiness of the land. Consequently, the Torah specifies that the punish- ment for these offenses is removal from the land. Moreover, as Naltmanides informs the reader, the land of Israel below is a symbol for the higher reality that corresponds to it in the sefirotic realm, viz., the Shekhinah.'39 "Permis- sion is not granted to explain in greater detail the matter of the land, but if you merit to understand the first land mentioned in the [opening] verse of Genesis and that which is mentioned in the chapter 'If you follow My laws' (Lev. 26:3), you will know the hidden and exalted secret."'40 The reference is obviously to the Shekhinah, which is the sefirotic correlate to the terrestrial land of Israel. He who enters one of the sexually prohibited relations is expelled from the land, which symbolically represents his being cut off from the Shekhinah.'4' In a similar vein with reference to the biblical portion con- cern ing manslaughter, Nahlmanides sets out to explain why in one verse Scripture emphasizes that these laws are to be applied "throughout the ages and in all your settlements" (Num. 35:29), whereas in a second verse it is especially emphasized that one should not pollute the land of Israel with murder, "for blood pollutes the land, and the land can have no expiation for 139. Cf. Gottlieb, Mehqarim be-Sifrut ha-Qabbalah, pp. 93-94; Henoch, Ha-Ramban ke-Hoqer u-khe-Mequbbal, pp. 147-148, 152-154. This symbolic correlation between Shekhinah and the land of Israel may also explain Nabmanides' appropriation of the rabbinic idea concerning the equivalence of Israel to all the commandments (cf. Tosefta, 'Avodah Zarah, 5:3; Sifrei Deut. pisqa 80, ed. Finkelstein, p. 146); see Perush to Lev. 18:25 (p. 112). And cf. Henoch, op. cit., pp. 145-146; M. Idel, "The Land of Israel in Medieval Kabbalah," in The Land of Israel p. 178. That is, just as the Shekhinah is the divine grade that is equivalent to all the commandments (see above, n. 118), so the land of Israel is the particular commandment that is the basis for, or the ground of, all the other commandments. Cf. Perush, Gen. 26:5; Deut. 4:5, 11:18. For a slightly different formulation on the nexus between kabbalah and the commandments, on one hand, and kabbalah and the land of Israel, on the other, in Nahlman- ides, see M. Idel, "Some Conceptions of the Land of Israel in Medieval Jewish Thought," pp. 131-132. On the nexus between the holiness of the land of Israel, fulfillment of the command- ments of the Torah, and the presence of God, see W. D. Davies, The Territorial Dimension of Judaism (Berkeley, 1982), pp. 18-29, 37-38. 140. Perush, Lev. 18:25 (p. 212). Cf. ibid., Gen. 6:13, 7:23, 9:12, 14:18, 24:3, 26:5, 28:17; Lev. 20:3, 26:42. See also Nabmanides' prayer on the ruins of Jerusalem, in Kitvei Ramban, 1:424-425 (already noted by Idel, "The Land of Israel in Medieval Kabbalah," p. 185, n. 45). 141. For Nalhmanides the locus of devequt, or communion, is the Shekhinah; see his com- mentary to Lev. 18:4, Deut. 11:22. A possible source for Nab1manides' particular formulation may have been ibn Ezra's commentary to Exod. 3:15 (ed. Weiser, p. 34): T'r,n tum p~  ,,, u. Cf.

Clearly, the prohibition against murder belongs to the class of laws, mishpatim, that are operative even outside the land of Israel. Nevertheless, Scripture emphasizes the defilment of the land of Israel by bloodshed "on behalf of the Glory of the Shekhinah (nru',n "nm) which is there . .. the mat- ter of impurity is such that if the land is impure the Glory of the Name (mna wVn) will not dwell there."'42 That is to say, therefore, that the apparent tex- tual problem is resolved by the fact that there is a special degree of holiness connected to the land that is, in turn, related to its being the symbolic cor- relate-and hence earthly receptacle-for the Shekhinah. Scripture thus can- single out the defilement of the land of Israel by acts of manslaughter even though it is a law that is assuredly applicable outside the land. In sum, then, it can be said that the overlapping of peshat and sod in Nah.manides' exegesis encompasses two distinct typologies. On the one hand, there is the typology of coincidence of the literal and figurative. In such cases there is only one textual dimension and, consequently, the exter- nal meaning is identical with the inner, mystical meaning. On the other hand, there is the typology of parallelism. In such cases there is a twofold textual dimension for the text refers simultaneously to two ontic referents, the mundane and the divine; yet in this case too one can speak of an over- lapping of peshat and sod, for the plain sense of Scripture only can be fully deduced by decoding the text in terms of the corresponding events in the divine realm. III In the third and final section of this paper I will investigate one last topic that is critical to an understanding of Nal.hmanides' kabbalistic hermeneu- tics, viz., the function of 'aggadah in Nah.manides' kabbalah. An examina- tion of this question is, in my opinion, crucial in evaluating the kabbalistic orientation of Nalhmanides and the role that creative exegesis plays in his religious imagination. Only by carefully analyzing the complicated nexus of aggadic ideas and kabbalistic motifs will we be in a position to determine the 142. Perush, Num. 35:33 (p. 340).</page><page sequence="52">154 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON extent and scope of Nalhmanides' conservatism in the realm of kabbalistic exposition. The relationship between kabbalah and 'aggadah in the minds of the early kabbalists, especially the Gerona school, has been amply discussed by Scholem and Tishby.'43 Both scholars have exoosed the underlvine her- meneutical attitude of the kabbalists towards the old 'aggadah: theosophical ideas were often viewed as nothing but expansions and disclosures of ideas hidden in the aggadic sources. R. Ezra of Gerona's description in his com- mentary on Shir ha-Shirim is indicative of the kabbalists in general: "The rabbis spoke of this wisdom [i.e., kabbalah] in the midrashim and the 'agga- dot by means of parables and enigmas (mr'm ,rn 5t) to dignify these matters and to conceal them. They scattered them, one here and another there, in order to hide their place."'44 In a similar manner R. Judah ben Yaqar, one of Nal .manides' teachers, explains the rabbinic teaching that through the study of 'aggadah one comes to recognize the Creator and to cleave to His ways'45 by reference to the fact that contained in the 'aggadot "in several places are the secrets of secrets, one reveals a bit and the other a bit, then you will understand."'46 It is clear that no kabbalist, including R. Ezra and R. Judah ben Yaqar, held that every kabbalistic idea has its source in rabbinic 'agga- dah. On the contrary, R. Ezra for his part is careful to distinguish between those symbols that he received as a kabbalah and others that he found exegetically in rabbinic texts.'47 It nonetheless seems clear that kabbalists, for the most part, alleged that they were transmitters of ancient lore rather than innovators.'48 Even Moses de Le6n, the innovative kabbalist par 143.

See ibid., fol. 4b, where Recanati, using a</page><page sequence="53">BY WAY OF TRUTH 155 excellence-using Idel's terminology-was committed to the position that kabbalistic ideas were hidden in the aggadic texts of the rabbis. Throughout his Hebrew theosophic writings he expresses this view. To cite but two salient examples. In the introduction to the second part of Sefer ha-Rimmon (1287) he writes: "And the sages ... concealed the matter in the exoteric meaning, but it is hidden, for all their words are within the palace of the king."''49 In a later work, Mishkan ha-'Edut (1293), de Le6n expresses this view, combining the terminology of Maimonides and R. Ezra. He notes that he is making known "all the matters which the holy ancient sages were preoccupied with all their lives. For they are scattered in the Talmud and in their words and in their hidden sayings, more hidden and precious than pearls. And they have closed the gate behind their words, and have hidden all their profound books, seeing that it was not appropriate to reveal and publish them."'50 The kabbalist, then, assumed a hidden dimension within aggadic texts that was known only to the one initiated in the secrets of the tradition. In the aggadah were concealed theosophic truths. This assumption regarding an inner or esoteric meaning to rabbinic passages, coexisting alongside the outer or exoteric, is found in medieval philosophical sources as well. As has been shown by Marc Saperstein and Frank Talmage,'5' the motivation for philosophers to seek an esoteric meaning in 'aggadah did not always stem either from an apologetical stance seeking to defend the rabbis against the outside attacks of Karaism, Islam, or Christianity, or from an internal rationalistic critique. On the contrary, some philosophers, including Maimonides, assumed that the rabbis cultivated philosophical truths and hid them in the 'aggadah in order to conceal them from the masses. Yet it seems fair to say that, whatever the theoretical similarity between the philo- formulation close to that of Jacob ben Sheshet, characterizes himself as follows: "I have not received these reasons [for the commandments] from a kabbalistic sage, for had I received them I would have said that they are a law given to Moses at Sinai" tn ', K , ri " ~,n* DN, 7, j 'n ? 1,K 149.

WOLFSON sophers and kabbalists on this score, in practical terms the mythic con- sciousness of 'aggadah was much more central to kabbalistic thinking.'52 Indeed, unlike the concepts of Aristotelian physics or metaphysics, or even Neoplatonic ontology, many ideas expressed in the kabbalistic texts, such as speculation on the divine attributes of mercy and judgment and the divine names to which they are correlated, developed organically out of aggadic passages on similar themes.'53 The classical 'aggadah, in all its formulations, was therefore treated as the fountainhead of kabbalistic truths in a way that was not reproduced in philosophical circles. Notwithstanding this fact, a theosophic reading of 'aggadah based on the system of sefirot, as proposed and maintained by the kabbalists, simply cannot be upheld as the original intention of the rabbinic texts. Hence, it may said that the kabbalist, like the philosopher, shared the need and desire to express new ideas in the guise of ancient authorities. Scholem expressed this feature of the kabbalistic her- meneutic in the following way: "I do not hesitate, for my part, to affirm that the literature of the Spanish kabbalah . . . clearly reveals a psychological attitude that, in the Middle Ages, led men to recast ancient talmudic and midrashic material according to an entirely new spirit by means of an exege- tical and homiletical method that in its structure was gnostic."'54 Bracketing for the moment the validity of Scholem's historiographical view of kabbalah as the gnostification of aggadic modes of discourse,'55 the critical point in his description is the extent to which medieval kabbalists sought to root 152. Cf. Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 30-32. For a partial critique of Scholem's position, see Saperstein, op. cit., pp. 17-20. Saperstein criticizes Scholem's statement that philosophers in all cases regarded 'aggadah "as a stumbling-block rather than as a precious heritage." He does not, however, challenge what I take to be the essential point of Scholem's analysis: the kab- balists' employment of mythic structures enabled them to live in a world that is "historically continuous" with that of the old 'aggadah. The same cannot be said about the philosophers. See also Septimus, Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition, pp. 106-110. 153. Cf. E. Wolfson, "Mystical-Theurgical Dimensions of Prayer in Sefer ha-Rimmon," in Approaches to Judaism in Medieval Times, ed. D. Blumenthal, vol. 3 (Atlanta, 1988), pp. 62-64.

The notion that mystical ideas were embedded in the aggadic proclamations of the rabbis was also suggested by S. Baron; see A Social and Religious History of the Jews (New York, 1958), 8:4-7. 154.

For Scholem this kab- balistic strategy represents one particular instance of a more general medieval phenomenon referred to by James Preus as the "theological legiti- mation for innovation." In Preus' own words: One of the first factors that has to be recognized here is that medieval society in general placed a high premium upon stability and order; in the religious realm, innovation and heresy were practically synonymous .... Thus, we shall not expect to see innovations advertized when they appear. They often come in disguise, cloaked in the reassuring garb of ancient authority.'56 Despite their best intentions, then, the medieval kabbalists were engaged in creative exegesis, transforming and transposing older texts in a new key rather than uncovering their historical and literary meaning. The thorny question of whether or not the "origins" of kabbalah are to be sought in some prehistorical or preliterary stage of transmission is besides the point, for even if we grant that kabbalistic ideas did not take shape ab ovo in medieval Europe, the fact of the matter remains that the activity of linking kabbalistic ideas to older aggadic sources is a major occupation in the golden period of medieval kabbalah. To understand kabbalah as a literary phenomenon one cannot ignore the programmatic effort of kabbalists to connect theosophical truths with ancient 'aggadah. Even if one argues that this link is to be understood in terms of a rabbinic anm , i.e., a textual sup- port for an independent proclamation, the need to create such linkage is in itself highly instructive of the innovative approach of kabbalists towards traditional documents, an approach that is often well hid behind the cloak of conservatism. To be sure, a proper understanding of kabbalistic texts demands an emphatic reading, to use the term of earlier hermeneutic theorists like Schleiermacher and Dilthey,'57 by which the interpreter dis- engages himself-to the extent that this is possible-from his own historical preconceptions and enters imaginatively into the life and time of the authors 156.

WOLFSON of the texts he is studying.'58 The critical scholar of kabbalah therefore would be imprudent to cast doubt upon the kabbalists' own admission that the truths they were imparting are of hoary antiquity. This conviction is a key feature that shaped the kabbalists' hermeneutic, and it is therefore incumbent on the modern reader to engage kabbalistic texts on this level. By appropriating this posture, however, one is in a better position to see the mechanism of kabbalistic interpretation for what it truly is: an innovative transformation of aggadic passages in light of a theosophic system that may itself have older roots in Jewish mythologumena, but which is, in most cases, extraneous to the rabbinic material. A careful examination of Nahmanides proves that he was not different in this regard. The linkage of kabbalistic explanations to aggadic sources is a repeated phenomenon in Nahlmanides' literary corpus. There are so many examples of this in the Torah commentary that it would be impossible here to mention even a fragment, let alone all of them. Suffice it to say that in the vast majority of instances wherein Nahlmanides introduces a kabbalistic explanation the latter is connected with a midrashic or aggadic text.'59 An examination of Nalmanides' commentary to Gen. 18:20 reveals the compli- cated interweaving of aggadic and kabbalistic strands in his thought. I will intimate to you the opinion of those who receive the truth (nman ,%p). 158. I am well aware of the critique of empathy advocated by earlier hermeneutic theories in more recent post-Heideggerian hermeneutics. Cf. H.-G. Gadamer, Truth and Method (New York, 1982), p. 221. The critical point is the difficulty in assuming that one can get out of one's mind in order to transport oneself imaginatively into the mind of the author, for this assump- tion is rooted in oversimplistic ideas about the nature of self-consciousness and intersubjectivi- ty. Nevertheless this disengagement is the sine qua non of the scientific attitude towards texts. A discussion about the meaning of texts will, of course, always involve self-understanding on the part of the interpreter, but even this self-understanding is attainable only after one "enters" into the text that one is reading. Cf. P. Ricoeur, Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences, p. 113: " ... if it remains true that hermeneutics terminates in self-understanding, then the subjec- tivism of this proposition must be rectified by saying that to understand oneself is to understand oneself in front of the text. Consequently, what is appropriation from one point of view is disap- propriation from another. ... What is appropriated is indeed the matter of the text. But the matter of the text becomes my own only if I disappropriate myself, in order to let the matter of the text be. So I exchange the me, master of itself, for the self, disciple of the text" (author's emphasis). 159. See, e.g., Gen. 1:1, 3, 7, 14,2:3, 7, 8, 6:4, 6, 13, 8:21,23, 9:12, 11:2, 14:18, 18:20, 24:1, 26:5, 28:21, 29:2, 33:20, 35:13, 46:1; Exod. 3:13, 14:21, 16:6, 19:5, 13, 25:3, 24; Lev. 1:9, 16:2, 18:25, 20:3, 23:17, 24, 36, 40 (cf.

He goes out from the attribute of mercy and enters the attribute of judgment. And so is this matter, "God [the Tetragrammaton sig- nifying the attribute of mercy or the masculine potency] said to His heart"'''6 [i.e., the attribute of judgment or the Shekhinah],'62 "the outrage of Sodom and Gomorrah is so great" (Gen. 18:20). I will descend from the attribute of mercy to the attribute of judgment, "and I will see" through mercy if "they have acted altogether according to the outcry that has reached Me" through the attribute of judgment; "if not, I will take note" (ibid. 21), and I will have mercy, in the manner [of the scriptural expression] "and Elohim [the attribute of judgment] knew"'63 [i.e., had mercy].164 The kabbalistic explanation is here presented as nothing but an expansion of the midrashic comment of the rabbis. Indeed, Nahmanides' exposition may be called a back-projection of the kabbalistic interpretation into the rabbinic text. Perhaps even more striking is Nahmanides' commen- tary to Gen. 6:6, "And the Lord regretted that He had made man on earth, and His heart was saddened." At first Nalhmanides follows good medieval rationalistic exegetical practice and explains the obvious anthropo- morphism as an allegorical utterance, citing as support the rabbinic dictum, "Torah speaks in human language." God's heart is to be taken allegorically as a reference to the divine holy spirit,'65 and not literally a physical organ. After explaining the verse in this way, however, Nah.manides refers to a pas- sage in the aggadic compilation, Genesis Rabbah,'66 which explains the notion of God's grieving in His heart by means of the parable of the archi- 160. Cf. j. Ta'anit 2:1, 8b. 161. Cf. Gen. 8:21. 162. Cf. Perush, Gen. 6:6 and 8:21. 163. Cf. Exod. 2:25 and see Nahmanides' commentary ad loc. 164. Perush, 18:20 (p. 112). 165. It is interesting to note that some of the commentators on Nahmanides understood the holy spirit as a reference to the Shekhinah. Cf. Shem Tov ibn Gaon, Keter Shem Tov, fol. 29b; Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 36. By interpreting Nah.manides in this way, however, one fails to grasp fully the two levels of interpretation with which he is operating here, to wit, the allegorical and the midrashic-mystical. 166. Cf. Genesis Rabbah 27:4. In the critical edition of Theodor-Albeck, pp. 258-259, only the first parable about the architect is given. For the reading of the other parable as well, see editor's note 6 ad loc.</page><page sequence="58">160 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON tect who builds a palace that displeases the king or the business agent who through trading causes a monetary loss to the king. The heart then is com- pared to an architect or an agent and God to the king. This parable, writes Nahmanides, is a great secret which cannot be written down. The one who knows it will con- template why [Scripture] speaks here of the Unique Name (m ,rmn m) [i.e., YHWH which is the attribute of mercy or the masculine potency] and in the rest of the section and the matter concerning the flood [it uses the name] Elohim [i.e., the attribute of judgment or the feminine potency].'67 Nalmanides, as the supercommentaries rightfully point out,168 understands the biblical expression "God's heart," as well as the midrashic images of the architect and agent intended to explain it, as references to the Shekhinah.'69 What is critical is the fact that here two levels of interpretation are offered, the allegorical and the midrashic, the latter being identified further as the mystical.'70 The full implications of Nahmanides' method are brought to light in Bahya ben Asher's commentary to this very verse. In the first instance Bah.ya cites the passage from Genesis Rabbah under the heading "according to the way of midrash" (vtrtin 1r ). He then offers the follow- ing mystical explanation: "By way of the kabbalah (nfpn 11'r L), 'His heart was saddened,' it [the heart] refers to the architect and the agent mentioned in the midrash, and there they [the rabbis] explained the secret of the matter." Any hard-and-fast line separating midrash and kabbalah here breaks down. To cite but two other typical instances of this in Nalhmanides' Torah commentary: in the commentary to Gen. 33:20 Nahmanides writes: "And by way of truth it [is found] in the midrash of our rabbis ... and there is a great secret in this matter."''7 In the commentary to Gen. 46:1 Nahmanides puts it this way: "This verse contains a secret which is revealed to us in Gene- 167. Perush, Gen. 6:6 (p. 50). 168. Cf. Shem Tov ibn Gaon, Keter Shem Tov, fol. 29b; Isaac of Acre, Me'irat 'Einayim, p. 36. 169. Cf.

That is, from Sefer ha-Bahir Nahmanides derives the symbolic meaning of Isaac as referring to a particular divine attribute, and he then applies this way of reading to Gen. 46:1. Finally, in light of this symbolism he reads theosophic meaning back into the aggadic passage. Nahmanides, it will be noticed, presents his method in reverse order: the verse in Scripture contains an esoteric truth that is found in Genesis Rabbah and further cor- roborated in Sefer ha-Bahir. On other occasions Nahmanides simply reads a midrashic source through the lens of kabbalah, without calling the reader's attention to this fact.174 Clearly, the underlying assumption for him is that theosophic mat- ters are concealed in the words of the talmudic sages. Nahmanides' commit- ment to the mystical potential of rabbinic 'aggadah is made clear in his com- mentary to Deut. 21:22. Nahmanides rejects Rashi's figurative reading of an aggadic parable attributed to R. Meir which is intended to explain the scrip- tural admonition not to leave a corpse hanging on a stake overnight "because an impaled body is an affront to God' (ibid. 22): "This may be compared to twin brothers who are in one city. One of them became king and the other took to thievery. The king gave a command and he [the brother] was hanged. Whoever saw him said, 'The king has been hanged.' The king commanded and he was taken down."'"75 According to Rashi, this parable must be interpreted figuratively as referring to the relationship between Israel and God. Nahmanides opposes this reading in the following cryptic remark: "The parable of the twin brothers contains a secret, and it is not as the Rabbi [i.e., Rashi] thought regarding Israel who are called 'sons of God'.""'76 For Nahmanides, Israel below and God above are not brothers only in a figurative sense, but they are so in a mystical sense, for the secret he alludes to here involves the symbolic, and hence ontological, parallelism between the Jewish soul and the divine paradigm.'77 Several of the super- 172.

WOLFSON commentaries on Nalhmanides further suggest that there is an allusion here to the kabbalistic secret of p, 3i t, the divine androgyny. That is, the one who commits the capital offense causes the masculine and feminine poten- cies of the divine to separate, and this results in an "affront to God," nbp enhN, i.e., to the feminine potency.'78 The defilement of the Israelite below is therefore a defilement of the divine above. The force of Nahmanides' kab- balistic reading of the aggadic parable can be seen when one compares his interpretation with that of his student, R. Solomon ibn Adret. The latter removed the theosophic interpretation and proffered an allegorical or figur- ative reading which he called "the literal sense of the parable,"  iv D kwn, viz., the twins are the soul and its angelic counterpart which is of a purely intellectual nature.'79 Another telling example of the phenomenon of reading rabbinic texts in light of kabbalistic meaning can be found in Nahmanides' account of the "mystical secret of the Tabernacle" (pvon "no) in his introductory remarks to his commentary to Exod. 25. After stating that this secret involves the in- dwelling of the Shekhinah or the kavod, which parallels the in-dwelling of the Shekhinah or kavod on Mount Sinai, Nahmanides makes the following comparison between the Sinaitic revelation and the theophanous quality of the Tabernacle. Just as at Sinai Moses heard the voice from heaven, so in the Tabernacle he heard that precise voice "addressing him from above the cover that was on top of the Ark of Testimony, between the two cherubim" (Num. 7:89). According to Nalhmanides, the kabbalistic secret-viz., that the voice, i.e., the masculine potency of God or the attribute of mercy, mudic passage under the heading "by way of midrash," and then explains that the mystical interpretation, "by way of kabbalah," comprises "an explanation of what is written [in Scrip- ture] and the parable (Sva, "ini ,n"), for the king is the Glory which is called the 'image of God' (aD''SN a), i.e., separated from him, i.e., the servant of God (D',nx "r). Since the impaled person is in the appearance of the image of God (o'r, ost nmvbr) it is 'an affront to God' (n5p ',,Kr) if he is not buried during the day and is left there during the night which is the time of the attribute of judgment."

Scripture repeats itself, writes Nalhmanides, "to indicate that which they [the rabbis] said in the tradition (,iap) regarding the voice that came to Moses from heaven from above the ark-cover and from there it spoke to him."'8" What is crucial from my vantage point is the fact that the view which Nalhmanides cites as something the rabbis "said in the kabbalah" is found in a classical midrashic anthology.'8' This "tradition," moreover, is understood in light of a theo- sophic process involving the dynamic of the masculine and feminine poten- cies of God. Hence, in this instance, it may be said that for Nahmanides the word ,ip designates an aggadic tradition whose "real" or implicit meaning is only grasped by reference to a kabbalistic idea. Indeed, on strictly ter- minological grounds there is evidence that for Nalhmanides the word ryip is not always restricted to the limited sense of mystical or esoteric tradition; it refers more generally to the rabbinic oral law that comprises aggadic ele- ments which-in Nahlmanides' mind-are connected with kabbalistic themes.'82 In the final analysis, I do not think that Nalhmanides would have felt the need to distinguish carefully between the aggadic and kabbalistic approaches to Scripture. Naturally, I do not deny that there are instances in his writings where the aggadic or midrashic interpretation is rejected in favor of a kabbalistic one'"83 or where the kabbalistic interpretation is offered as an alternative to a more straightforward aggadic one.184 The point I am 180.

The one as the other assumes, in Septimus' words, a "layer of meaning coexisting but going beyond the plain sense of the text."'"5 A key term for Nahmanides that accounts for both aggadic and kabbalistic meaning in Scripture and that bridges the gap between text and interpretation is that of remez. Nahmanides uses this term, or any of its derivatives, to indicate the layer of meaning that is implicit or inherent in the text. As he says in his commentary to Num. 3:1, nTVnml Viun ,nin, ,, "the Torah makes explicit and alludes."'86 It lies beyond the confines of this paper to treat in a comprehensive manner the development of this terminus technicus from talmudic and midrashic sources to medieval halakhic and kabbalistic texts. Suffice it to say that Nahmanides' usage does have its roots in the earlier usage, specifically in those contexts where rabbinic authors used the word remez to refer to an allusion to a certain practice or custom in a biblical text.'87 By utilizing this word Nahmanides is making clear that in his opinion kabbalistic truths-as aggadic explanations-are implicit in the body of Scripture.'88 Paradigmatically, in the introduction to 184.

The text thus makes explicit the external aspect while implying the internal aspect through hints and allusions. This assumption is shared, according to Nahmanides, by the ba'al 'aggadah and the mequbbal, who both set as their task the drawing out of the implied truths embedded in the text. The central role played by 'aggadah in Nahlmanides' kabbalah can also be seen from the fact that he cites Sefer ha-Bahir as Midrash R. Nehuniah ben ha-Qanah'90 or simply as midrash,'9' disclosing the fact that he was of the opinion that this kabbalistic text was not only midrashic in nature but also of tannaitic origin. Thus the same passage cited in the Torah commen- tary to Gen. 1:1 in the name of the Midrash R. Nehuniah ben ha-Qanah is cited in Torat ha-Shem Temimah in the name of "our rabbis," un121.'92 In his commentary to Gen. 1:3 Nalhmanides cryptically refers to the Bahir in these terms: "Our rabbis have in this matter a midrash concerning a hidden secret," abra "n0 wlnor. Or, again, in his commentary to Gen. 1:8 he thus re- fers to the Bahir.: "they have a mysterious midrash," KN v1-rn ni y~. Nah- manides' implicit assumption regarding the relationship between the Bahir manides also employs the word ten or derivatives in the sense of symbol, i.e., a thing below is a Te' for that which is above, for the former is a sign or symbol of the latter. In that sense rTml is equivalent to n". Cf. Bacher, op. cit., p. 38 who has noted this equivalence in zoharic termino- logy. See also idem, 'Erkhei Midrash, p. 125, n. 1. This usage is widespread in medieval kabba- listic sources. The identification of 1' as the allegorical mode of interpretation in the famous acrostic PaRDeS is misleading if one does not bear in mind that ten does in fact function primarily in the kabbalistic sources in the sense of mystical symbol. This point, as far as I am aware, has been largely overlooked in the scholarly literature. 189. Perush, Introduction (p. 4). 190.

WOLFSON and the kabbalistic allusions in rabbinic 'aggadah is stated explicitly in a passage from R. Isaac ben Jacob ha-Kohen of Soria cited by R. Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov: "This is the way [of the rabbis] ... to allude by means of allusions to a deep, wonderful and hidden secret. And of the allusions which they mentioned in the haggadot in the Talmud and the midrashot, the one that is [considered] the greatest and most important by the kabbalists ... is Sefer ha-Bahir."'93 According to R. Isaac, therefore, there is no substantial difference between the kabbalistic allusions found in aggadic material in the Talmud or separate midrashic collections and the kabbalistic 'aggadot found in the Bahir. From the interweaving of aggadic and Bahiric passages in Nahmanides one can safely conclude that he would have subscribed to R. Isaac's formulation. This assumption is important for two reasons when evaluating Nah- manides' kabbalistic hermeneutic: first, as a source for citation the Bahir was as authoritative as any other standard midrashic collection; second, insofar as he read the Bahir as an ancient midrash he was able in turn to read midrashic texts in light of Bahiric symbolism. One therefore finds that in many instances where Nahmanides cites the Bahir he cites in addition a standard midrashic or aggadic passage.'94 We have already seen one exam- ple where Nah.manides reads an aggadic passage in light of the Bahir, and this in turn generates a kabbalistic reading of Scripture. Another striking example of this is to be found in Nalhmanides' commentary to Gen. 24:1, "And the Lord blessed Abraham with all things," 'km Dniix T: 'n.195 In connection with that verse Nahlmanides discloses an esoteric truth about the nature of the ninth and tenth divine attributes, Yesod and Shekhinah, by interpreting the talmudic 'aggadah in light of Bahiric symbolism.'96 By read- ing the text kabbalistically the word 2 becomes a name for Shekhinah, who is so called because she is "in the All," ba-kol, the All referring in turn to Yesod. Hence, through the kabbalistic reading of the aggadic passage one gains a deeper understanding of the biblical passage, i.e., that God "blessed 193.

Even a cursory glance at this passage will show how unusual it is, for, instead of giving a sentence or two, Nah.manides delivers a rather lengthy discourse deciphering the kab- balistic symbolism, utilizing several aggadic texts as well as two key sections from the Bahir. Interestingly, Bahya ben Asher at the end of his commentary on the verse writes: "Understand this principle, for the matter is hidden. The RaMBaN, blessed be his memory, disclosed the matter explicitly, and he extended the explanation beyond what was required." This is indeed a curious remark, coming as it does from the pen of a writer whose kabbalistic commentary far exceeds that of Nahmanides in volume and scope. One must also bear in mind that Nahlmanides was fully committed to the notion that the 'aggadot themselves, although not necessarily in every case, operated on two levels, the exoteric and esoteric. Thus, for example, in his commentary to Gen. 1:7 he cites an enigmatic saying of Ben Zoma from Genesis Rabbah 4:7 and suggests that perhaps he "had a hidden explana- tion whose secret he did not want to reveal."'97 In his commentary to Gen. 6:6 (a passage that I have already commented upon above in a different context) he argues in the other direction, assuming that the midrash alluded to a secret truth that he cannot elaborate upon further in writing: "In Gene- sis Rabbah with respect to this important matter there is a parable (Tra l~y tub) ... and it is a great secret which cannot be written (In', Kt hVTa "nO K1M 2n,)."'98 In his explanation of the issue of separation mentioned in Gen. 1:14, "God said, 'Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate day from night,'" Nahmanides brings together several distinct aggadic tradi- tions by understanding their hidden meaning in light of one kabbalistic explanation: "'He separated [the light from darkness]' (Gen. 1:3). R. Judah ben Simon said, 'He separated it for Himself.'"99 ... And if you can know their [the rabbis'] intention in saying in the Blessing of the Moon, 'a crown of splendor (n1Kxn nutY) for those borne by Him from birth,'200 you would 197.

WOLFSON know the secret of the primordial light, and that of the hiding and separa- tion [of the light], as it is said, 'He separated it for Himself,' and the secret of the 'two kings who make use of one crown,'201 for in the end 'the light of the moon shall become like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall become sevenfold' (Isa. 30:26)."202 The esoteric meaning of the aggadic explanation of God's separating the light for Himself is identical with the meaning of the legend regarding the sun and moon, who were compared- before God diminished the light of the moon-to two kings making use of one crown. In kabbalistic terms, the sun and moon refer to Tif'eret and Shekhinah, the masculine and feminine aspects of God, alluded to in the Blessing of the Moon in the phrase "crown of splendor" (n1Kxn nmitv). Hence, that God separated the light for Himself means really that God separated the light from Himself, i.e., there was a separation within the divine between the masculine and feminine, the sun and the moon, the splen- dor and the crown.203 Although there was this primordial separation of these forces, in the end there will be unity between them, as was prophesied by Isaiah. The 'aggadah-and ultimately Scripture itself-is here transposed in the key of kabbalistic theosophy. Nahmanides similarly assumes an esoteric meaning to 'aggadah in his commentary to Exod. 19:13 where he rejects Rashi's literal reading of a pas- sage from Pirqei R. 'Eli'ezer, chap. 31, and proposes that this legend contains an allusion to a kabbalistic secret.204 Although in this case it is clear that the kabbalistic understanding is offered as an alternative to the mid- rashic, it is noteworthy that even the former is linked to an aggadic state- ment. Moreover, as we have seen, in his commentary to Deut. 21:22 Nahlmanides rejects Rashi's figurative reading of an aggadic text and alludes to a kabbalistic interpretation. By contrast in his commentary to Deut. 11:8 Nah.manides cites Rashi's explanation, which is a paraphrase of the follow- ing midrashic comment concerning the bodily obligations that are to be ful- filled outside the land of Israel: "You will soon perish [from the good land that the Lord is assigning to you]. 201.

This may be compared to a mortal king who got angry with his wife and sent her to her father's house. He said to her, "Adorn yourself with your jewelry so that when you return they will not be novelties for you."205 Commenting on this Nahmanides writes, "In this midrash there is a deep secret and I have already alluded to it."206 Nahmanides, as Shem Tov ibn Gaon already noted,207 refers to his esoteric explanation of the expression "the laws of the God of the land," 7', ,;eK p n, to which he alludes in his commentary to Gen. 24:3 and 26:5. In the latter context he explains that Abraham's fulfillment of the entire Torah, as well as his knowledge of the mystical reasons for the commandments and the secrets of the Torah, was possible only in the land of Israel.208 Even though there are bodily obliga- tions that are not dependent on the land for their fulfillment, the essence of the commandments is tied to the land, for there is a mystical connection between the land, i.e., the Shekhinah, and the commandments.209 This is the meaning of the expression "the laws of the God of the land," i.e., the laws of that God are particularly bound to the land, and it is the esoteric meaning of the midrashic parable which sees the fulfillment of certain commandments outside the land as a form of adornment which will keep one properly pre- pared for reentry into the land. Finally, there is the well-known comment contained in Nalhmanides' own account of his disputation with Friar Paul at Barcelona in 1263. Any treatment of Nalhmanides' attitude towards 'aggadah, even if limited, as in our case, to the role of 'aggadah in his kabbalistic exposition, must take this comment into account.

WOLFSON Temple,210 Nal.manides at first replied: "I do not believe in that haggadah, but it is proof for my words." When Paul retorted, apparently in an outcry, "See, he contradicts their books," Nahmanides responded more cautiously: "Either this 'aggadah is not true, or else it has another explanation accord- ing to the mystery of the sages (a~n nnon)."211 He then stated, as an obvious polemical tactic, that he would accept the 'aggadah literally, for it afforded proof for his case, i.e., insofar as Jesus was not born on the day of the destruction of the Temple, he could not have been the true Messiah. Scholem suggested that Nalhmanides' true intention in the remark that the aggadic passage might have "another explanation according to the mystery of the sages" could be gathered from a text by one of Nal.manides' disciples, Sheshet des Mercadell, concerning the secret of metempsychosis, in which this 'aggadah figures as a key proof-text.212 If Scholem has correctly under- stood Nalimanides' allusion, then the first option in Nahlmanides' remark that the 'aggadah may not be true should be construed as a rejection of a literal reading of the aggadic text. In effect, the two parts of the statement are not in any way contradictory or incompatible, for the claim that the aggadah may not be true simply means that a strictly literal reading is not true, and this is precisely what is implied in the suggestion that follows regarding the possible mystical or esoteric reading. It is important to note, moreover, that the Latin protocol of the disputation does not have any mention of Nal.manides' second alternative concerning the possibility of a secret underlying the aggadic text.213 Furthermore, there is no other refer- ence to kabbalistic matters in the account of the disputation. It may very 210. j. Berakhot 2:4 (5a). For other references to this legend in rabbinic sources, see L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (Philadelphia, 1968), 6:406, n. 53.

In the context of the disputation he only wanted to invalidate the Christological reading of the talmudic legend by either denying the literal- ness of it or accepting it as literally true for the sake of the argument. That this interpretation of Nalhmanides' remark is plausible may be sup- ported by a second comment of Nahmanides which, to my knowledge, has been overlooked by all writers who have tried to understand Nahmanides' position as expressed in the disputation. I am referring to a statement made by Nalhmanides in his commentary to Exod. 24:1, "Then he said to Moses, 'Come up to the Lord.' " Nalhmanides interprets the passage attributed in b. Sanhedrin 38b to R. Idi, according to whom the verse must be interpreted as follows: God tells Moses to come up to Metatron, whose name is like that of his Master.214 Commenting on this passage Nahlmanides notes: I have already mentioned the [rabbis'] intention with respect to this name [Metatron], and all their words are true. Yet they spoke in that homily (mran) as one who conceals his face (P,'3 1rnb), for R. Idi did not reveal to this here- tic (pr) who asked the question the matter of the great Metatron and his secret, God forbid.215 As may be discerned from other contexts in Nahlmanides' commentary,216 it is clear that, according to his kabbalistic system, Metatron refers to the Shekhinah.217 The latter has Metatron as one of its names because this divine grade is entrusted with providential care, and the name Metatron, at least according to the etymology accepted by Nalhmanides, means the "guide of the road," 11T, ,11v.218 In any event, it is precisely this mystical explanation 214. Nah.manides ad loc. rejects Rashi's interpretation, according to which Metatron is the one who told Moses to come up to God. See the commentary of Rashi to b. Sanhedrin 38b, s.v., poetnt im.

See also the anonymous fragment in MS JTS Mic. 1892, fol. 54a, where reference is made to Na1manides' commentary to Exod. 24:1. 218. The etymology according to this interpretation is derived from the Latin metator, meaning a "measurer" or "one who marks out." Such a usage is to be found already in tan-</page><page sequence="70">172 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON that, according to Nalhmanides, R. Idi did not want to divulge to the heretic. Is it unreasonable to draw the methodological parallel between this explanation by NaIhmanides of the talmudic discussion and his own experi- ence at Barcelona? Just as the third-century Palestinian rabbi did not wish to expound upon the mystical meaning of Metatron before the sectarian, so too Nalhmanides refrained from expounding upon the mystical meaning of the 'aggadah about the Messiah before the Christian.219 Indeed, on the next day, Nalhmanides returned to the question of this aggadah, this time placing it in the context of a longer explanation on the general status of 'aggadot. Here we find again a two-staged approach on the part of Nalmanides: at first he states that he does not accept as authorita- tive the legend about the Messiah's birth on the day of the destruction of the naitic sources, as is pointed out by Nahlmanides himself in the commentary to Exod. 24:1. See Sifre Deuteronomy, pisqa 338 (ed. Finkelstein, p. 388), and the editor's note 2, ad loc. The refer- ence there, however, is not to Metatron the angel. Cf. P. S. Alexander, "The Historical Setting of the Hebrew Book of Enoch," Journal of Jewish Studies 28 (1977): 164, n. 15. Nahmanides conflates this supposed Latin etymology with the Greek etymology-which he mentions speci- fically-of metator, which means "messenger." The latter etymology was popularized by the talmudic dictionary 'A rukh of Nathan ben Yeh.iel of Rome. Such an etymology for Metatron is found in a citation by R. Ezra of Gerona in the name of Isaac the Blind of Provence; see Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, pp. 298-299. Cf. also H. Odeberg, 3 Enoch or the Hebrew Book of Enoch (New York, 1973), pp. 127-128 (Introduction). A recent attempt to substantiate the supposed etymology of Metatron from the Latin metator (combined perhaps with the Greek metron) has been made by G. Stroumsa, "Form(s) of God: Some Notes on Metatron and Christ," Harvard Theological Review 76 (1983): 287. For another account of the etymology of Metatron as deriving from the Greek synthronos (which is synonymous with metathronos), see S. Lieberman's appendix in I. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden, 1980), pp. 235-240. 219. In this regard it is of interest to consider the following words of.Yehiel ben Joseph of Paris in his disputation with Nicholas Donin at the court of Louis IX in 1240 (cited from S. Grfinbaum, Wikkuah [Thorn, 1873], p. 2): "There are in them [the words of the rabbis in the Talmud] matters of 'aggadah to draw the heart of a person [cf. b. Hagigah 14a; Sifre Deutero- nomy, pisqa 317, p. 359; and see Hillel of Verona, Sefer Tagmulei Nefesh (Jerusalem, 1981), p. 181] so that he will understand the external sense (irin T,:'). And there are in them wonder- ful [or secret] words (Kn 'i2'1) which are difficult for the infidel, heretic, or apostate to believe. Concerning these there is no need to respond to you. If you want you may believe them, and if not, then do not believe them, for no law is determined by them." These words come strikingly close to those of Nahlmanides (discussed below, see references in n. 222). Cf J. Katz, Exclusive- ness and Tolerance.: Studies in Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times (New York, 1962), pp. 108-113: R.

Immediately after stating this, Nahmanides, quite remarkably, reiterates his position of the preceding day and asserts that he accepts the aggadah concerning the birth of the Messiah on the day of the destruction of the Temple according to its literal meaning because, when taken as such, it proves that Jesus is not the Messiah, for he was not born on that day: 'Sn ', inlKn f~i~ K' ~Ine ... . nev.220 Clearly, the technique used by Nahmanides is to give in to the Christian demand that he accept the 'aggadah because he could utilize that very 'aggadah in a polemical way to undermine the Chris- tological stance. Nalhmanides' acceptance of an 'aggadah that he ultimately rejects is not a blatant contradiction, but merely points to a stratagem used to counter the claims of the disputant.221 In this case there is no mention of the other alternative regarding the possibility that the aggadic statement may contain a secret or mystical explanation. There is no mention of this here because at this stage of the argument such a consideration is completely irrelevant. That is, what Nalhmanides wishes to impart to the reader of his account of the disputation is that at this point he was prepared to accept Friar Paul's insistence that he accept the 'aggadah, for by accepting it he was able to use it to attack his opponent's position. For the purposes of this paper it is necessary to reflect further on the implications of Nalhmanides' fuller remark made at the disputation concern- ing the nature of 'aggadah. Nalhmanides, as I have already mentioned above, stated with respect to midrash or 'aggadah that if one believes it, it is well and good, but if one does not believe it there is no harm.222 Reflecting on this statement, several scholars in the past had been led to the conclusion that Nalhmanides was arguing against his own belief; the disclaimer must be seen only in the polemical context and not as representative of his true view- point.223 A growing scholarly consensus, however, challenges this interpre- 220.

WOLFSON tation and maintains that what Nalimanides said about 'aggadah is a sincere statement of his belief.224 One of the more cogent presentations of this line of argument is that of Septimus, who has argued that there is sufficient evidence in Nalh.manides' biblical commentary, a nonpolemical context, to show that Nalhmanides was indeed prepared to reject outright aggadic state- ments. Hence, Na.limanides did not only want to undercut the force of the Christian stance to prove the truth of Christianity from aggadic statements, according to Septimus, but this represents, on the contrary, his true posi- tion. It will be recalled that Saul Lieberman had already argued that Nalh- manides' apparent take-it-or-leave-it attitude towards 'aggadah, or more precisely aggadic passages that have no halakhic implications, had its prece- dent in geonic traditions such as ,Ira  ,Dmo K.225 In Septimus' view, however, Nalhmanides' attitude towards 'aggadah was somewhere in between the literalist approach of the Franco-German tradition and the Andalusian rationalistic attitude, which saw a need to allegorize 'aggadot in order to make them more feasible. Indeed, in Septimus' opinion, when Nah- manides "resorts to kabbalistic defense it is often of aggadot that are entirely beyond the reach of Andalusian understanding,"226 i.e., his kabbalistic interpretation of 'aggadot serves first and foremost as a response to ration- alist critique. Thus, Septimus calls our attention to "a basic terminological point of contact between Nalhmanides' polemical disclaimer and his mature Barcelona (1263)," Harvard Theological Review 43 (1950): 128; M. Cohen, "Reflections on the Text and Context of the Disputation of Barcelona," Hebrew Union College Annual 35 (1964): 170-171: H. H.

That is, Septimus accepts Nahmanides' denial of aggadic author- ity at the Barcelona disputation as his genuine opinion on the basis of the fact that in his commentary "he almost invariably attaches the term agga- dah to those interpretations about which he seems uneasy, which make sense only when interpreted nonliterally, or whose seriousness and author- ity he is calling into question.227 Although I do not believe that on a purely terminological basis Septimus' position can be maintained in every case,228 the main thrust of his argument is well-taken insofar as Nalhmanides clearly did not uphold the literal meaning of every aggadic remark. Recently, Marvin Fox has supported Septimus' position on this score by both locating Nahmanides' circumspect attitude towards 'aggadah in the larger context of rabbinic authorities and by establishing various typologies in Nahmanides' commentary, especially on the book of Genesis, in which aggadic passages are rejected.229 With respect to this essential issue, then, there can be no argument. Septimus is therefore correct in pointing out that Nahlmanides' reading of 'aggadot is not as straightforward and simple as that of Rashi. To be sure, as he indicates, there are sufficient examples in Nalhmanides' commentary where aggadic statements are rejected without any indication that they embrace a deeper, mystical meaning. I thus agree with Septimus' claim that "Nahmanides did not see kabbalistic interpretation as a universal key to the understanding of all aggadah."230 Septimus is likewise correct in emphasiz- ing that the view that "because Nalhmanides was a kabbalist he must have accepted the authority of all aggadah" is patently fallacious.23' Nevertheless, it seems to me that in his effort to correct a widespread misconception regarding Nalhmanides' attitude to 'aggadah, Septimus gives insufficient notice to what is in fact the critical issue in determining the role of 'aggadah 227. Septimus, op. cit., p. 21. 228. See, e.g., Perush, Exod. 1:1, 19:13; Lev. 16:8; Num. 1:32. 229. See M. Fox, "Nahmanides on the Status of Aggadot: Perspectives on the Disputation at Barcelona, 1263," Journal of Jewish Studies, 40 (1989): 95-109. 230. A similar point has been made with respect to Nahmanides' disciple, R. Solomon ibn Adret; see the studies of C. Horowitz and D. Horvitz cited above, n. 29. 231. Septimus, "Nahmanides and the Andalusian Tradition," p. 21, n. 37. This view is attri- buted by Septimus to Scholem, but I am unable to locate any passage in Scholem's writings that would warrant such an attribution. See the claim of Maccoby, Judaism on Trial, p. 37, that R. Yehiel of Paris certainly thought that aggadic passages have an allegorical or mystical meaning, "for Jewish mysticism took much of its sustenance from these very passages, understood in a figurative or coded sense."</page><page sequence="74">176 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON in Nahmanides' kabbalistic exposition. The real concern is not whether Nahmanides' posture as a kabbalist forced him to accept as binding every single aggadic statement, but rather the central position accorded to the theosophic reinterpretation and transformation of 'aggadot in Nahmanides' kabbalistic exegetical activity. When the issue is posed in this way it seems to me undeniably clear that such exegetical activity is beyond doubt the life- blood of Nahmanides' work in the area of kabbalah. From that perspective it can be said, inverting Septimus' language, that Nahmanides saw aggadic interpretation as the universal key to the understanding of kabbalah.232 Moreover, in evaluating Nahmanides' kabbalah and its relationship to 'aggadah, one cannot simply focus on passages where the author uses the term, for in the majority of cases he cites aggadic texts without labeling them as such. Viewing the matter this way, one is led to the obvious conclusion that aggadic exegesis is central to Nahmanides' kabbalah. One would be hard-pressed to ignore this dimension when one examines Nahmanides' kabbalistic statements. In light of the above it seems to me necessary to qualify somewhat the characterization of Nahmanides as a conservative kabbalist. It is certainly the case, as Idel points out, that Nahmanides asserted on various occasions that kabbalah consists of esoteric truths that were received by Moses and have been transmitted orally, and which cannot, therefore, be deduced by reasoning or supposition. The fuller analysis of Nahmanides' position would require a careful examination of the contexts wherein Nahmanides employs the distinction between supposition and tradition. It is undeniably true that Nalmanides had such an image of the mystical tradition. Yet it is somewhat curious that Nahmanides never, so far as I am aware, mentions a teacher with regard to kabbalistic matters.233 It is well-known, of course, as I mentioned above, that one of his teachers was Judah ben Yaqar, who in fact was a kabbalist. Nal.manides mentions ben Yaqar several times in his 232. In this connection it is of interest to note that later Hasidic masters incorporated the study of 'aggadah under the category of the study of kabbalah. See., e.g., R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Tanya, pt. IV, chap. 23, fol. 137a. And cf. B. Z. Dinur, Be-Mifneh ha-Dorot (Jerusalem, 1955), p. 165, n. 37. 233. In the commentary to Sefer Yesirah which Scholem published in the name of Nalh- manides, we do find the author divulging esoteric matters with the introductory phrase "And I have heard," ,nuval, thus suggesting that he has received these matters orally from a teacher. But, characteristically, no teacher is mentioned by name. See "The Authentic Commentary of the RaMBaN to Sefer YeSirah," ed. by Scholem, Qiryat Sefer 6 (1929-30): 404 [in Hebrew]. It should also be noted that in at least three of the manuscripts of the same text, p. 406, mention is made of "the Hasid," a term usually taken to refer in the writings of the Spanish kabbalists to</page><page sequence="75">BY WAY OF TRUTH 177 halakhic writings,234 but never with respect to a kabbalistic doctrine. This fact is somewhat puzzling given Nahmanides' own insistence on the neces- sity to have a teacher in order to understand kabbalistic allusions. In trying to chart out Nahmanides' kabbalah the little we know of ben Yaqar is not terribly helpful.235 TO be sure, it is highly unlikely that Nahmanides did not learn mystical matters from ben Yaqar; indeed, in the writings of R. Shem Tov ibn Gaon, the disciple of R. Solomon ibn Adret and R. Isaac ben Todros, the teachings of ben Yaqar are cited,236 leaving one with the impres- sion that ben Yaqar's teachings were still revered in Nahmanides' circle. Moreover, in terms of style ben Yaqar's fluid transition from 'aggadah to kabbalah is reminiscent of Nahmanides, though I would maintain that in ben Yaqar it is sometimes more difficult to draw the line between the agga- dic and kabbalistic reading of a rabbinic source. The laconic and reserved transmission of esoteric matters is also conspicuous in both authors. Nevertheless, in his presentation of kabbalistic ideas, Nahmanides does not himself rely on tracing his kabbalah to ben Yaqar or to any specific teacher. It seems to me, rather, that in this regard the Sefer ha-Bahir is the crucial source which informed Nahmanides' kabbalah.237 One could, of course, argue that these alternatives are not mutually exclusive, for perhaps it was from his teachers, such as ben Yaqar, that Nah- R. Isaac the Blind (see Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, p. 254). The reference, though, does not suggest that the author, supposedly Naimanides, received anything from the Hasid, but merely reflects that he was cognizant of an alternative reading and interpretation. See, however, p. 407 and Scholem's n. 2 ad loc., and cf. p. 410, n. 2. For another discrepancy between Nah- manides' explanation of a passage in Sefer YeSirah and that of R. Isaac the Blind, see "The Commentary of R. Isaac of Acre to the First Chapter of Sefer YeSirah," published by Scholem, Qiryat Sefer 31 (1955-1956); 383 [in Hebrew]. This discrepancy was already noted by Scholem, without relying on the evidence of R. Isaac of Acre, in Qiryat Sefer 6 (1929-30): 402, n. 2. 234. Cf. Chavel, Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, pp. 38-44. 235. See, however, Idel, "We Have No Tradition," p. 57. See also E. Ginsburg, The Sab- bath in the Classical Kabbalah (Albany, 1989), pp. 108-111, who has noted the influence of Judah ben Yaqar on Nahmanides with respect to the marital motif connected to the Sabbath. In particular, Ginsburg notes that in three places Nahmanides, like his mentor, interpreted Genesis Rabbah 11:8 as an allusion to the divine wedding. Cf. Perush to Gen. 2:3, Lev. 23:26, and Deut 5:15. See also below, n. 237. 236. See, for instance, Shem Tov ibn Gaon, Keter Shem Tov, fols. 29a (citing his teacher, i.e., R. Isaac ben Todros, who received from R. Judah, i.e., Judah ben Yaqar), 37b, 44b. The latter two references refer to the same interpretation found in ben Yaqar's Perush ha-Tefillot we-ha-Berakhot, p. 89. 237. One problem with this thesis is the fact that Nahmanides' conception of the divine emanations varies from that of the Bahir. For Nabhmanides the sefirot are the divine essence, whereas in the Bahir the divine potencies are depicted as instruments or vessels. Cf. Idel, Kab-</page><page sequence="76">178 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON manides received the Sefer ha-Bahir.238 Interesting in this regard is the fol- lowing observation made by R. Sadok ha-Kohen of Lublin (1823-1900) in the context of contrasting Nalhmanides' kabbalah with various other types of experience or insights that can be found in Jewish mystical literature: "It appears to me that the kabbalah of the RaMBaN and his teachers and stu- dents is a new insight (nvrnnrv ,av,) . .. and its foundation is based on the Sefer ha-Bahir of R. Nehuniah ben ha-Qanah, which was disclosed to them, and from which RaMBaN cites frequently."239 While the claim that Nah- manides received the Bahir from his teachers is indeed plausible enough, it is almost impossible to evaluate this adequately in light of our scanty knowl- edge concerning his teachers in kabbalistic matters. In any event, the critical point is that in his own transmission of kabbalistic truths the role played by the Bahir is the decisive one. The importance of this source, as I have already indicated, lies in the fact that it represented a literary document whose authenticity and traditional authority Nahmanides accepted. He therefore read the Bahir as an aggadic source, and this factor undoubtedly unleashed his creative imagination to recast aggadic statements in the mold of theoso- phical kabbalah. While other kabbalists before Nahmanides had reinter- preted aggadic texts in light of kabbalistic symbolism, Nahmanides was the first to apply this hermeneutical strategy in a biblical commentary intended for mass consumption. Beyond the specific citations from the Bahir that one finds scattered in the Torah commentary, the influence of this work upon Nahlmanides can be seen in the frequent linkage of kabbalistic truth to an aggadic text. In Nahmanides' thought, then, there is a convergence of theo- sophy and 'aggadah, and it is on this basis and through this medium that Nahlmanides can present kabbalah as the "way of truth" of normative Judaism . Judaism. New York University New York, N.Y. balah: New Perspectives, pp. 137-138. The essentialist view seems to have been taken by Judah ben Yaqar as well; see Perush ha-Tefillot we-ha-Berakhot, pt. 1, p. 22, where we find that God is equated with His name and His attributes. On the relation between the traditional thirteen middot and the ten sefirot in the NaImanidean tradition, see the cryptic remark in Keter Shem Tov, fol. 31b. See also Todros Abulafia, 'Osar ha-Kavod ha-Shalem (Warsaw, 1879), fols. 16c-d. For a more general discussion of this problem in the early kabbalah, see J. Dan, Hugei ha-Mequbbalim ha-Rishonim (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 1-10. 238. In the case of ben Yaqar there is no direct citation of the Bahir by name, though in some cases in his writings a possible influence of it can be detected. Cf. Perush ha-Tefillot we-ha-Berakhot, pt. 1, pp. 110-111 to Sefer ha-Bahir ? 102 and 157, and pt. 2, p. 42 to Sefer ha-Bahir, ? 157.
