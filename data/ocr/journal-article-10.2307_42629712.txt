<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANDSCAPE and CjENKE TAINTING in TENNESSEE, 1810-1985 In 1832 Alexis de Tocqueville observed in Democracy in America that "In aristocracies a few great pictures are produced; in democratic countries, a vast number of insignificant ones."1 One need not accept this in full to recognize its truth in part. Traditionally art patronage has flourished amid wealth and in urban environments. However much artists may prefer rural subjects for their works, it has usually been city dwellers who have bought the paintings. So, few will be surprised to read here that Tennessee, which throughout its history has been overwhelmingly rural, egalitarian, and lacking in concentrated wealth, never has been a major art center; nor has it produced a painter of the first, or even second, rank. Yet, Tennessee has produced some fine artists and some very good art, especially landscapes. The diverse beauty of Tennessee, from mountains to Mississippi, has attracted both native and non-native artists. This exhibition showcases their work in landscape and genre painting over the past 175 years, since the first datable Tennessee landscape painting in 1810. No claim is advanced that the works in this exhibition are necessarily the best Tennessee landscapes and genre scenes, although some of them clearly are. They are the best works that were known and available by the artists selected to be included. Not every Tennessee landscapist is included by any means, but those who are represented show the diversity and transition of styles and subject matter that has occurred here. In recent years there has been an upsurge in collecting Tennesseana, including paintings. Nostalgia, pride of place, and patriotism partially explain it, but there is also a genuine desire to know more about our cultural patrimony and to share in it by the possession of objects from our past. Our past. Tennesseans do not collect Tennessee corner cupboards or sugar chests because, by an objective measure, they 7</page><page sequence="2">compare with the work of Louis XV's ébénistes. No American furniture does that. They are collected because they are thought to relate to us. If the proper study of mankind is man, then Tennesseans should study the art that has been produced here, for its intrinsic beauty, yes, but also for what it tells us about ourselves, our ancestors, and our land. We should know how generations of artists have perceived Tennessee. But our perceptions of their work, and our reactions to their values, are equally important. Unfortunately, scholarship has not kept pace with the growing public interest in Tennessee art and material culture. A few articles appeared in Antiques in 1971, but not much has appeared since. This exhibition, and future ones planned by the State Museum, are intended to fill that gap, and to stimulate further study. This exhibition purposes to make known the names and works of many artists hitherto unknown, or little known, and to relate their work in Tennessee to the mainstream of American art. Antebellum Tennessee provided a market only for portraiture, which was valued among a people whose family ties were strong, but even that demand was insufficient to provide regular employment for artists in a fixed place. Most Tennesseans depended on the services of itinerant artists of varying abilities. A few of the wealthy had their portraits painted in New York, Philadelphia or Baltimore. There was no substantial market in early Tennessee for either landscape or genre painting, still life, mythological, allegorical or religious painting. A few landscapes were painted, but they were isolated examples. The earliest Tennessee landscapes are the two purely decorative overmantel paintings at the Carter Mansion in Elizabethton. Probably they date from 1790-1800. Their subject matter is obscure, but both include an element of landscape, although the landscapes are purely imaginary, not based on observation of nature. Of the limited quantity of antebellum landscapes, topographical views and estate portraits were one type. The earliest such Tennessee view is Rebecca Chester's A Full View ofDeadrick's Hill (1), dating from 1810-11. This famous view of Jonesboro, Tennessee's oldest town, is an enchanting example of folk art, that is, art produced by untrained amateurs, a form plentiful in Rebecca Chester's native Pennsylvania, but little practiced here. The surface of the painting is extremely flat. There is no perspective, no use of receding planes to suggest pictorial depth. The large house, Poplar Hill, is above Main Street rather than behind it. Felix Grundy McGavock, the teenager who painted Grundy Place (7), was also an amateur, but had some knowledge or intuition of artistic principles. So did the unknown artist of Mississippi River, West Tennessee (5), painted about 1840. It combines some familiarity with perspective and other artistic devices with a substantial dose of naivety. So does Suspension Bridge, Nashville (9), but with greater weight on the professionalism. Certainly the best of the topographical views is the jewel-like watercolor of Memphis (3) by John H. B. Latrobe. A 8</page><page sequence="3">man of many talents, including prize-winning architect, Latrobe painted it in 1832 on his return to Baltimore from his wedding in Mississippl. There was an upsurge of patriotism in America after the War of 1812. The heroic exploits of Decatur, MacDonough, Perry and Jackson instilled confidence in a people previously unsure of their place in history. This upsurge of patriotism coincided with the emergence of the Romantic Movement in thought, art and literature, and the confluence produced great pride in the American landscape, especially the wilderness. It was thought that the wilderness experience had forged our national character and that the purifying power of the natural wilderness protected America from the corrosion of European poverty, corruption and decadence. Was not the maker of America's manifold natural wonders also the divine author of America's Manifest Destiny? For the first time in America, landscape painting became a marketable skill. Under the impulse of the Romantic Movement, mere topographical description was transformed into real art. And realistic art, too. Idealized landscapes were left to Europeans. Americans wanted to paint the landscape just as it was. America's first group of major landscape painters became known as the Hudson River School, although their method came to be emulated by artists throughout the country. It has been said of their paintings that one can count the leaves on the trees. Edmund Burke, writing in 1756, observed that the vastness was part of our concept of the natural sublime. For that reason, to capture the majesty of the landscape, the panorama became the favored format of the Hudson River School and its followers. But there were divergent tendencies among these landscapists. Some preferred scenes of serenity, repose and poetry. Others stressed the turbulence of wild nature and Man's insignificance and impotence contrasted to it. Burke had also written that awe as well as delight was part of our concept of the natural sublime, and fear was part of awe. The first known panorama of Tennessee is Ralph E.W. Earl's Cumberland River Near the Hermitage (2), painted about 1823. It is Earl's only known landscape, and certainly it emphasizes tranquility rather than turbulence. That is not surprising for an artist who was a generation older than the Romantic painters, was little influenced by them or by Romanticism, and who had studied in London with the American expatriate and neo-classicist Benjamin West. Earl was Tennessee's first resident professional artist. He came to Nashville in 1817 to paint Andrew Jackson's portrait. He married Mrs. Jackson's niece, moved in with the Jacksons at the Hermitage, and lived with Jackson in Nashville and Washington until the artist's death in 1838. Another poetic panorama is Emil Bott's Cumberland River Near Nashville (8), painted in the 1850s. Somewhat more wild in appearance, because of the season depicted, is Tennessee River Among the Cumberland Mountains (6), painted by an unknown artist about 1850. It employs 9</page><page sequence="4">the early Hudson River School device of placing small figures in the landscape to accentuate the scale of Nature. Thomas Cole, the leading artist of the Hudson River School, painted his series The Course of Empire as a warning against too much commerce, development and civilization. But the warning was in vain. By 1850 the wilderness was receding. Had Cole been alive, he could no longer have said "We are still in Eden." We had eaten the fruit of material success and the march of civilization went on. By 1850 Tennessee was the fifth most populous state. Nashville and Memphis were among the fastest-growing cities in America. Tennesseans took pride in the growth of their cities and panoramic landscape painting came to include city views. The best antebellum city view is Nashville From Lower City Island (10), painted by an unknown artist shortly before the Civil War. It combines a view of nature with a view of the bustling city. The newly- completed State Capitol, pride of all Tennesseans, is seen through the trees to the right. Possibly by the same hand is Belmont (11), a topographical estate portrait commissioned by Joseph and Adelicia Acklen in 1859 or 1860. It was possible to have an estate portrait and a personal portrait in one painting. A portrait of Nashville Inn proprietor William T. Lewis and his wife, dating from about 1800, shows their home "Fairfield" in the distance. About 1859 Samuel Shaver, the prolific East Tennessee portraitist, began incorporating small landscapes into his portraits, usually views of the sitter's home or lands. His William Montgomery Churchwell, at the Tennessee State Museum, shows such a view through a window. His John Roper Branner includes an estate portrait of the sitter's lands at Mossy Creek, including the Branner house, "The Maples." But Shaver's most ambitious landscape, a panorama of Rogersville, Tennessee, appears in the background of his 1860 portrait of Joseph Francis Foard (12). Another artist who combined portraiture and landscape painting was James Cameron. Born in Scotland, he came to Philadelphia and exhibited there before taking a wedding trip to Italy. On his return to the United States, he moved to Nashville, but almost immediately was enticed to Chattanooga by Colonel James A. Whiteside, who gave him studio space, lodging and commissions. In 1858-59 Cameron painted Colonel James A. Whiteside and Family (15), in which he placed his sitters on an imaginary Italianate terrace overlooking Moccasin Bend, with the city of Chattanooga in the distance at the extreme right. This painting, judged by the New York Times' critic to be the highlight of the recent exhbition "Painting in the South," demonstrates the complexity of Cameron's work. He combines elements of sophistication and naivety. The overall effect of the painting is undeniably charming, and the effect of the foreshortened perspective is similar to Flemish works by the Van Eycks and others, but the composition is very artificial, too literal an application of his Italian experience to an American setting. His painting Moccasin Bend (14), done a year earlier, is a more beautiful, though less interesting, picture. 10</page><page sequence="5">Cameron was Tennessee's pre-eminent antebellum landscapist, and the first resident artist to paint primarily landscape. Among his other paintings are Belle Isle From Lyon's View (16), an idyllic Knoxville scene painted in 1861, and Waterfall Near Chattanooga (17), an 1862 view in which one can literally count the leaves on the trees. Cameron left Tennessee during the Civil War because patronage had evaporated. He returned after the war, but the desolation of the Chattanooga landscape and the continued lack of patronage persuaded him to give up painting altogether. There was painting in Tennessee during the Civil War, but it was not done by resident artists, but by outsiders who came in the train of the Union armies. Alexander Ransom, a Boston artist, came to Tennessee after the fall of Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, which General U.S. Grant had captured in February, 1862. The foliage in Near Fort Donelson (18) indicates that it was painted some months later. It is what is called a luminist painting . T exture is de-emphasized in favor of light, especially the reflection of light on water. The brushwork is nearly invisible and there is a pervading stillness. The excessively dramatic coloring of the sky is reminiscent of Frederick Edwin Church's 1860 painting Twilight in the Wilderness, which Ransom may have seen, but which in any case inspired a whole genre of like paintings. Far more linear, as expected from an illustrator whose work had to be engraved for publication, is Alexander Simplot's Battle of Memphis, ]une6, 1862 (19). Simplot was a "special artist" for Harper's Weekly, the illustrated magazine. He was at the Battle of Shiloh in April, 1862, and was at Memphis on June 6, 1862, for the naval battle between Union gunboats and rammers and Confederate "cottonclads." The sketch he sent to Harper's Weekly differs from his later painting in several respects. The point of vantage is higher in the painting, exposing more of the Memphis waterfront, although admittedly the landscape is incidental to the painting. It is not certain that James Walker, who painted Union Cavalry at Lookout Mountain (23) and The Battle of Lookout Mountain (24), came to Tennessee to research his paintings. The landscape of each is essentially the same and may have been painted from photographs. Walker looked backward to the tradition of Napoleonic battle panoramas. He was adept at painting uniform features and other details, but his lead soldiers are unconvincing and in his paintings every battle looks like a parade . If war was hell, you would not know it from these . Of course this was official art. General Joseph Hooker commissioned Walker's The Battle of Lookout Mountain. Some Civil War paintings were done by soldiers. James Gaddis, a private in the 12th Wisconsin Infantry, painted three watercolor sketches of his regiment's activity in West Tennessee (20-22). He was entirely untrained, as was presumably the artist of Bluecoats in Bivouac on Lookout Mountain (25), possibly one H. Bambrick. One soldier-artist in Tennessee, James Hope, had been a professional artist before the war. His View From Lookout Mountain (26), painted in 1878, presumably 11</page><page sequence="6">was done from a wartime sketch. It is faithful to the Hudson River School tradition, in which Hope worked even after the war. Northern artists visited the South at the end of the war to see what had been so long denied them. In 1866 the Philadelphia portraitist O.S. Spang painted a rare Tennessee snowscape, In the Sequatchie Valley, Tennessee (29), and Xanthus Smith painted Forever Tennessee (27), a pastoral scene that bridges the gap between wilderness and civilization. It has darker colors than most antebellum landscapes, a harbinger of the future. The most important Tennessee landscape painted in 1866 was actually done in Carlsruhe, Germany. Alexander Wyant, who in the late 1850s and early 1860s worked in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Frankfort, Kentucky, apparently visited Tennessee before the war and made sketches. In 1865 he went to Carlsruhe to study with the Norwegian landscapist Hans Fredrik Gude. In 1866 he produced Tennessee (28), about which his teacher said, with exaggerated understatement, "You may be very glad to have painted that picture." It depicts the Grand Canyon of the Tennessee, that is, the gorge created where the Tennessee River cuts through the Cumberland Mountains. The waterfall in the foreground is artistic license. Otherwise the view is identical to modern photographs. At first glance, Tennessee appears to be a typical Hudson River School painting. The magnificence of the land is conveyed by the sweeping vista. It is highly finished, the details meticulously rendered, and the cataract suggestive of the power of Nature. In fact, this is a transition piece. The subdued coloring and attention to atmospherics are steps away from the Hudson River tradition. Some details are accentuated and others are omitted. The foreground is forcefully drawn, emphasizing the hardness of the ground, but the background is no longer seen with crystalline clarity. It is vaguer, muted. The painting was denounced for "German harshness" and was refused at the Royal Academy in London and at the Paris International Exposition. Wyant sent "the condemned picture" back to the United States. A few years later it was considered Wyant's masterpiece. Time was on the artist's side.2 The Civil War had been America's final loss of innocence. No longer did American artists look inward. American landscapists still painted American scenes, but European artistic influences began to change the style of painting. Americans became strongly influenced by the French Barbizon School of about 1850, where the technique of painting was looser and there was more concern for the overall effect of a painting than with the careful rendering of details. These more loosely painted works also were executed with a somewhat darker palette. The most influential exponent of the new style was George Inness, and Alexander Wyant was one of his admirers. Strictly realistic paintings came to be regarded as just pretty pictures. It came to be expected that a landscape would reveal the artist's nature as well as Nature. No longer was the artist expected to show God's 12</page><page sequence="7">handiwork without personal interpretation. Subject matter was gradually subordinated to the painterly process. How a painting was painted became more important than what was being depicted. Of course, not all artists adopted the new style, and those who did differed in degree. The topographical tradition - Tennessee's first landscape tradition - continued, as evidenced by View From the Cupola of East Tennessee University, Knoxville June 1871 (30) and Nashville (32), from about 1880, but most postwar painting was looser in style than the Hudson River School. A good example is Cornelius Hankins' The Original Hermitage (34), painted on the day in 1889 when the Ladies Hermitage Association took possession of the Hermitage properties. A few years later Hankins went to Richmond, Virginia, but he returned to Nashville just after the turn of the century and painted there until his death in 1946. Another Tennessean much influenced by Barbizon painting was Lloyd Branson. He was the first East Tennessean to study art in Europe, and on his return to Knoxville about 1878, he began painting portraits much more sophisticated than the almost primitive style that prevailed there just a decade earlier. His prize- winning Hauling Marble (38) might easily be mistaken for a Continental exhibition piece. Branson's Pasture (41), where the paint is heavily applied and the brushwork very obvious, is a further step removed from the smooth-surfaced Hudson River School tradition. Stylistically similar to Branson's Hauling Marble is Emma Bell Miles' The W Road (48). She had had some art training in St. Louis. Other than looseness of painting, another feature of the postwar period was the popularity of genre painting, for which there had been no Tennessee market before the war. The term genre painting is derived from the French word gens, or people, and means scenes of people engaged in activity, as distinguished from portraiture. Almost all genre painting in T ennessee includes a significant degree of landscape, which is why it is included in this exhibition. This writer knows of few interior Tennessee genre paintings like those produced by John George Brown and James Wells Champney in New York and Boston, which at least has spared us paintings of "little darlings" with their kittens. The earliest known Tennessee genre painting is JK Polk 1840 / Knoxville, Tenn. (4) by an unknown artist. Evidence suggests that it depicts Polk's address to Democrats in Knoxville on July 4, 1840. Thomas Waterman Wood worked in Nashville from 1858 to 1862. He painted portraits, but yearned to do genre scenes. He left Nashville because there was no market for them. But before he left he painted Southern Cornfield, Nashville, Tennessee (13) using local blacks as models. It was the first of many paintings by Wood featuring blacks and was anecdotal without being sentimental. The work was one of the earliest Southern paintings to portray blacks with dignity, and as individuals, not stereotypes. John Stokes, like Wood a Northern artist, painted Wedding in the Big Smokies, Tennessee (31) in 1872. This depiction of a "Shivaree" was sold in the North and it remained there until the Tennessee State Museum 13</page><page sequence="8">acquired it in 1983. It would have catered to a Northern audience that thought of the South as a quaint land of "mountain men" and "darkies." Almost nothing is known about the artist, who, like many others represented in this show, combines elements of naivety and sophistication. The artist succeeds in suggesting relationships among the people depicted in the painting, so is surprising that so little is known about an artist of this quality. Another genre painter, Elizabeth Nourse, was from Cincinnati, but spent the summers of 1884-86 in the mountains of East Tennessee. In 1885 she sketched and later painted Tennessee Woman Weaving (33). The colors are subdued, showing the influence of Cincinnati-artist Frank Duveneck. In 1887 Nourse moved to France, where she spent the rest of her life painting peasant women, mothers with their children, and genre scenes of rural France. Gilbert Gaul came to Tennessee in 1881 to take possession of an inherited farm in Van Buren County, Tennessee. Until 1910 he spent part of almost every year in Tennessee. He was perhaps the first Tennessee artist who did not paint portraits, except of Indians. As a very young man he rose quickly to the forefront of the American art scene by the success of his military and other genre scenes. He showed interest in the broken light that entranced the Impressionists, but unlike them he did not dissolve his forms into light. In fact, his loose handling of paint owed more to the Barbizon School than to Impressionism. His very distinctive brushwork, which makes his work easily identifiable, is seen in Rafting on the Cumberland (43), Tennessee Cabin (44), and The Last Letter (45). Another style of painting, called Tonalism, flourished in America between about 1880 and 1915. It was very popular in the South, especially in neighboring Kentucky, where there were a number of Tonalist painters in Louisville. Tonalist paintings had either one dominant color or an overall colored mist or atmosphere through which forms were seen.3 Some scholars see Tonalism as a further development of American Barbizon painting, in the direction of more subjective subject matter and poetic evocation through the use of moody, mysterious atmospheres. Others see it as a sub-school of Impressionism because of their shared indifference toward realistic depiction. In any case, Tonalism never took hold in Tennessee. Whether or not it was related to Tonalism, Impressionism became the rage in America in the 1890s. The term is derived from the word "impression" in the title of one of Claude Monet's paintings in the Impressionists' first group exhibition in 1874. The Impressionists were interested in light, but not as the Luminists had been. The Impressionists saw that light was color and they dissolved forms into the colors of light. They painted outdoors, en plein air, rather than in studios. Outdoors, where light was constantly changing, shimmering, there was no time to mix colors, so they laid down colors side by side with dabs of bright color quickly and intuitively applied. The technique was improvisational. At a certain distance, the colors, divided rather 14</page><page sequence="9">than blended, produced the desired effect - an impression of an object, person or scene. Whereas objects have distinct edges, light does not, so in impressionist paintings edges are blurred and objects blend into each other. Generally, shadow was eliminated. At first, Impressionism was shocking to the art establishment, but soon it became the convention. The soft and hazy light of the American South was particularly suited for the impressionist style, but surprisingly little of it was done in the South compared to, say, tonalist painting. But just as Tonalism was relatively less important in Tennessee than elsewhere in the South, so Impressionism was relatively more popular here than elsewhere. Impressionism had a strong hold on Tennessee artists for decades. William Posey Silva, a Chattanooga businessman, first took art instruction in the 1890s and in 1905 he devoted himself to art full-time. He studied in France and adopted the impressionist style. Near Chattanooga (51) is typical of his work, and typical of impressionist landscape except for his use of the panoramic format. Impressionist paintings generally sought to charm rather than awe and most landscapes were more intimate, on a smaller scale. Other impressionist works in this exhibit are Louis Jones's Landscape (58) and Pumpkin Patch (57), C. Curry Bohm's Early Morning in The Tennessee Mountains (53), Bertha Herbert Potter's heavy impasto Landscape (56), Mayna Avent's Tennessee Wheatfield (50) and Off Franklin or Nolensville Pike (51), and Charles McLaughlin's Tennessee in Spring (54). Several of these artists produced impressionist works right through the 1930s, long after they had ceased to be fashionable, or even acceptable, in Europe. Art trends came to Tennessee later and stayed later. Some of Tennessee's best Impressionists, Adelia Lutz and Catherine Wiley for example, did not paint landscapes. Watercolor, previously a sketch medium for most Tennessee artists, became a principal medium for some artists in the twentieth century. Charles C. Krutch of Knoxville painted innumerable watercolors of the Great Smoky Mountains, his only subject. He had worked in oils, even applying oil paints with his fingers, but the results generally were not successful. He was a much better watercolorist. In Landscape I (55) he depicts beautifully the phenomenon that gave the Smokies their name - the mountains wreathed in smoke-like clouds. Krutch was called "The Corot of the South," but there is no evidence that European painters had any influence on him. Indeed, in the twentieth century, an indigenous American watercolor tradition developed. The period between the World Wars was the golden age of American watercolor painting. As responsible as anyone was Ohio-born Charles Burchfield. He developed what he called "Conventions for Abstract Thoughts," which were symbols he used in his paintings to give anthropomorphic qualities to inanimate objects like trees. Sometimes he did not use such overtly expressionist devices, but relied on elongation, distortion and exaggeration to produce a quality of fantasy or other psychological effects. Something of this may be seen in Sue Joy's First Baptist Church, 15</page><page sequence="10">Pigeon Forge (62) and Martha Hale's Coal Tipple (66). The reaction against Impressionism is called Post-Impressionism, although the two long co-existed. Artists like Cézanne sought to redress the balance, which they thought the Impressionists had upset in the direction of chaos with their shimmering light and dissolved forms. Ella Hergesheimer' s Landscape (59), which is geometric and coherent, typifies the reaction to Impressionism. She said flatly that she wanted to restore design to painting, a quality she said the Impressionists had lost. Ironically, her principal teacher had been William Merritt Chase, America's leading Impressionist. By the 1930s Tennessee artists were being affected by New York's Armory Show of 1913. Semi-abstract and cubist influences from Europe began to be felt. Elements of semi-abstraction can be seen in the pastels of Will Henry Stevens (60-61). Avery Handly of Nashville and Winchester produced cubist paintings of St. Mary's Church in Nashville (67) and Hundred Oaks Castle in Winchester (68). Forms were no longer seen as the colors of light but as shapes and planes. The geometric longings of Cézanne and Hergesheimer had been taken a step further. Joseph Van Sickle's Downtown Nashville (70) is another example of semi- abstraction. Handly and Van Sickle are typical of Tennessee artists in not having gone beyond the point where subjects were recognizable. George Cress's Landscape Below (73) and East of the Ridge (74) are more abstract than Handly or Van Sickle, yet still the landscape of the Chattanooga bluffs is recognizable in the patches of color and geometric forms. During the past twenty years, there has been a movement among Tennessee artists back to greater realism. This has taken several forms, from Jack Knox's nostalgic illustrations of Tennessee's vanishing lifestyles (71-72) to Carroll Cloar's semi-pointillist paintings about childhood memories and fears. Cloar really has never been a landscape painter, in that all his works include figures whose actions are the central message of the pictures, but invariably landscape is an important element in his compositions. Cloar's works are representational, but not necessarily realistic, in that the coloring is chosen for effect rather than for accuracy. This is true of Reelfoot (76), where the viewer must look carefully for the phantom figure in the painting. Cloar's Marker on the Mississippi (77) is too monochromatic to be agronomically accurate, but it suggests the relative continuity of the muddy river and the muddy riverbank. Similar in feeling to Cloar's work is Bill Sawyer's Child Chasing a Butterfly (78). Differing in style from each other, but similar in subject matter, are the works of David Craft and William Houston. Neither paints specific sites. Both paint landscapes which are composites of features in their regions - Craft's Chattanooga and Houston's Jefferson County. Craft's Summer Solstice paintings (81-82) are idealized while Houston's Tennessee Landscape #74 (79) is photo-realistic. John Boatright's Fountain Creek Mill (80) is conventionally beautiful. 16</page><page sequence="11">Some of the best landscape painting in Tennessee today is in watercolor . Jim Gray of Knoxville is a master at fluid handling of that medium, as evidenced by Near Caton' s Chapel (83). At the other end of the state, Memphis' Veda Reed suffuses her landscapes (84) with the moist, misty atmosphere of the Mississippi Delta. This quality, taken alone, might incline us to call her a tonalist painter, but she does not shun bright colors, and she practices an extreme simplification of forms and economy of line. Equally unclassifiable is Lowell Hayes's very personal statement, A T.V.A. Commonplace (85-86), which depicts his birthplace before and after its inundation to create Watauga Lake. Hayes regrets its passing, but believes it vanished in the worthy cause of elevating rural living standards. Such ambivalence toward the landscape is not new to Tennesseans. The Tennessee River, for all its wild beauty, was a life- threatening force of destruction before it was tamed. But the tremendous amount of landscape painting in Tennessee today is proof of a continuing love of this land. It is hoped that this exhibition will nurture that love and inspire other artists to capture the beauty and diversity of Tennessee. 'Quoted in Henry P. Rossiter, "Introduction," M. &amp; M.
