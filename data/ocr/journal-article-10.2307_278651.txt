While such a result may be obtainable by using glue, normally a thickness of more than 3/8 inch in the final product is desirable, and it seems likely that better results will be realized through use of other prep- arations (Berger 1960; Smith and Moodie 1947: 66; Smith, McCreery, and Moodie 1952: 246 ff). To date, glue has been used only to collect thinner, more trans- portable samples which are faced off smoothly in a man- ner familiar to the archaeologist. Acknowledgments. In early 1961 Arthur A. Theisen, then of the Department of Soils, Oregon State University, provided a de- scription of the taking of soil profiles which served as a prototype for the method outlined here. Henry W. Smith, Professor of Soils, Washington State University, and Kermit C. Berger, Professor of Soils, University of Wisconsin, kindly furnished descriptions of techniques currently in use by them in the preservation of soil profiles. Some practical measures - specifically the use of a per- forated tin can in place of the spraygun, and the use of strips of cloth to tie the soil column to the mounting board - were adopted directly from Smith (personal communication) and from Smith and Moodie (1947).

UNIVERSITY OF OREGON Eugene, Oregon December, 1962 TWO FIRED-CLAY FIGURINES FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA A. B. ELSASSER ABSTRACT Fragmentary human figurines from archaeological sites in Sacramento and Marin counties are described. It is suggested that noting slight variations in decorative and other characteristics within the type may aid in providing a clear picture of the geographical and chronological dis- tributions of these specimens in western North America. DURING THE PAST 20 years numerous anthropomor- phic baked-clay figurines from California have been de- scribed in publications. These objects are quite often crude and schematic, and seem to comprise a fairly dis- tinct culture trait in California and adjacent regions. The trait is thought to be derived from the American Southwest. In turn, the point of origin of the South- western figurines may possibly be in central Mexico (Davis 1959: 25). Even though probably less than 100 individual examples have been found in archaeological sites in several parts of California, it appears that there has been a sufficient range of variation among the speci- mens to merit description of virtually every piece that has come to light. This note is intended to put on record two fired-clay figurines now in the collections of the Lowie Museum of Anthropology of the University of California, Berkeley. One of these (No. 1-38509), found on the surface of a site near Sacramento almost 30 years ago, has been overlooked in previous discussions, while the other (No. 1-148136) was recovered in 1962 during a large bulldozing and scraping operation in Marin County, just north of San Francisco Bay. The site, des- ignated Mrn-365, was reported by Mrs. David S. Moore, who found the figurine in a disturbed area and subse- quently donated it to the University of California. Two additional baked-clay objects thought to be basal frag- ments of female figurines were found at the same site, but are too sketchy and without enough distinguishing characteristics to merit description here. The Sacramento example (Fig. 1 a) is a fragment, and it is identifiable as a possible figurine only by the curvilinear, punctate design on its frontal surface. Simi- lar punctation has been noted on several complete Cali- fornian specimens which have additional characteristics that permit classification as female figurines (Heizer and Pendergast 1955, Fig. 62 c). The specimen is 6 cm. long, 4 cm. wide, and 2.1 cm. thick. It is tan-colored, partly mottled, and was made from a fairly fine-grained clay, slightly and possibly not deliberately tempered. Temper- ing material, fine sand grains, and numerous flecks of mica may have been present in the original clay. The fragment is decorated on one side only. There is no way of knowing what kind of implement was employed to execute the small punctations, which measure only about 1 mm. in diameter but are relatively deep (2 mm.). The fragment was recovered from the surface of the Johnson Mound (Sac-6), a site which has been exca- vated many times and which has produced literally thou- sands of baked-clay objects, most of them evidently utili- tarian. Since the alluvial soil of the lower Sacramento River valley contains few stones suitable for use in the stone-boiling process with baskets, it seems almost cer- tain that these clay objects were largely used in this proc- ess as substitutes for locally unavailable field stones. Many of these egg- or loaf-shaped objects bear decora- tion consisting of crude punctation or basketry impres- sions. Also small, bird-shaped, clay figurines have been excavated at the site, as well as another anthropomorphic figurine. The latter is described by Davis (1959: 20) as an undecorated, modeled fragment, the upper half of a female figurine containing two nodal swellings which probably reptesent breasts. The time assigned to this female figurine is A.D. 1600-1850 (Phase II of the Late horizon in central California). Since the decorated speci- men was found on the surface of the site, it probably should not be considered as predating A.D. 1600, although 118 [ VOL. 29, No. 1, 1963</page><page sequence="2">FACTS AND COMMENTS FIG. 1 [ELSASSER]. Front views of two figurine fragments from central California. a, Johnson Mound (Sac-6), Sacramento County; b, near Novato (Mrn-365), Marin County. the time of first occupation of the site was probably around A.D. 300. The Marin County figurine (Fig. 1 b) is definitely of a female, although it too is fragmentary, that is, the upper portion is broken off at a point where the neck and shoulders would have been. It is likely, in view of the other figurines which have been found in this part of California, that this specimen did not include a head, or at best, had one merely suggested by a small, feature- less nub. As it is, the figurine measures 5 cm. long, 2.7 cm. wide, and 1.5 cm. thick. There are no decorative markings nor any definite attempts at anatomical de- piction on the rear. The clay is light brown in color and fine-textured except for inclusions of sand grains, which may be a deliberately added tempering agent. Apart from the two distinct breast protuberances, each con- taining a small pit or indentation at its center, and the small pit in a spot slightly above that which would be considered normal for the location of the human navel, there are two other decorative elements to be noted in the specimen. One is composed of a line of small, cir- cular punctations, probably made by pressing the end of a section of a blade of grass or a minute bird-bone lightly into the clay. This line of punctations extends from one side of the object to the other just above the breasts and with a slight "dip" between them. It presumably was in- tended to represent a string of shell beads. Decoration near the breast region has been noted in other figurines from California, and one specimen (Heizer and Beards- ley 1943, P1. 26 b) has a zigzag punctate design extending from the shoulders almost to the navel, between the small breasts. In this instance, it is more likely that tattooing or perhaps scarification is represented. Another example, an unfired-clay figurine from Death Valley (Wallace 1957: 132), has a distinct representation of a necklace on the front side only. This decoration is v-shaped, terminating between the small breasts of the figurine. Counterparts of the four shallow, transverse grooves in the lower thoracic area of the Mrn-365 specimen have also been observed on several other female figurines, from both central and southern California (Davis 1959, Fig. 1 f; True 1957, Fig. 2 a; Heizer and Beardsley 1943, P1. 26 f). In all of the examples cited except the last (Heizer and Beardsley), the grooves are associated with small pits, which are taken to be representations of the human navel. These grooves were perhaps intended to denote some sort of maternity costume, although in the present example no marked swelling in the subabdominal re- gion, representing pregnancy, is noted. Some of the figurines from southern California (True 1957, for exam- ple, Fig. 2 a) show both grooves and bulbous lower ends, 119</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY but it is probably stretching reason to interpret the latter as indicating pregnancy. If we look upon these grooves as representing binding straps or trusses, we are still con- fronted with the question of their function. The Mrn- 365 figurine obviously is that of an adult form, hence could not easily qualify as of a "cradled infant" type. Possibly we are dealing with the same question posed by Lehmann (1953: 79), who points out that certain Mexi- can figurines of the recumbent type show bands or trusses across the chest region, and the figures seemingly are not depictions of children. Beyond these speculations, nothing substantive can be offered to suggest the meaning of the grooves. Probably the dating of specimens displaying grooves is diverse, al- though the closest example to the present specimen is the fragment, also from Marin County, shown by Davis (1959, Fig. 1 f). This was recovered from a depth of 30 inches, and has been assigned to a Middle horizon cul- tural context (1500 B.C.-A.D. 300). It has already been stated that the purpose of describ- ing these two figurines is to call attention to detailed variations which may lead to recognition of single traits. Such descriptions probably will never contribute much evidence concerning the function of these archaeological figurines, for example, as objects used in increase rites, or as fertility symbols, toys, or dolls. The most that can be expected is that this recording of minute details may be useful in tracing the distribution through time and space of an apparently specialized artifact which has a relatively long history in the New World.
