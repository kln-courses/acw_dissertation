<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Beauty of Enervation: Woman, India, and the Anxiety of System in HegePs Philosophy Nicholas A. Germana Keene State College In Hegel's systematic account of the unfolding of World-Spirit, woman and India exist prior to, and outside of, the daylight of reason, which illuminates life in the modern rational state. The existence of these "Others" poses an inescapable threat to the modern western male observer. If he is not armed with the weapon of rationality, he is in danger of being overwhelmed by the alluring sexual power of the flowery Orient or the seductive woman. By continually denying the "Other," a share of the "self-cognizant" life of the modern world, Hegel reveals the anxiety at the foundation of his system. There is a beauty of a peculiar kind in women [...]. [S]uch a beauty we also find in its loveliest form in the Indian world; a beauty of enervation in which all that is rough , rigid , and contradictory is dissolved , and we have only the soul in a state of emotion - a soul , however, in which the death of free , self-reliant Spirit is perceptible. Hegel, The Philosophy of History1 In his introduction to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's Philosophy of Nature, Michael John Petry instructs the reader that "[i]f the Hegelian system is to be fully appreciated, it has to be grasped as a whole."2 This article attempts to do so by concentrating on two subjects that appear repeatedly in HegePs writings and lectures from around 1805 until his death in 183 1, "woman" and India, and the logic that binds them, in HegePs philosophy over the course of approximately 2 5 years. These themes are traced in HegePs oeuvre through excerpts from several of his major works, most notably his lectures on the History of Philosophy, the Philosophy of History, the Philosophy of Religion, and the Phenomenology of Spirit, The Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences , and the Philosophy of Right. There is, perhaps, a danger in losing the trees for the forest - in exploring these themes as they reflect HegePs work as a whole, while the individual works themselves are not given the attention they justly deserve. Yet the mainstay of HegePs popular lectures, including those on the History of Philosophy, Phi- losophy of History, Philosophy of Religion, and aesthetics, were delivered and revised repeatedly over the course of years, in some cases over the course of more than two decades. Hegel was clearly concerned with the articulation of his ideas and spent considerable time polishing and repolishing them for public presentation. Each successive iteration embodied key revisions in his thought,</page><page sequence="2">92 German Studies Review 34/1 (2011) but also served to underscore the continuity in what Hegel intended to be a complete philosophical system. With that in mind, I have chosen to emphasize and analyze the sweep of Hegel's thought, rather than focus exclusively on one or two of his major works. The choice of these subjects is not arbitrary. In her feminist existentialist manifesto, The Second Sex (1949), Simone de Beauvoir illuminated the position that "woman" occupies as Other in Hegel's thought and western patriarchal culture generally. Beauvoir also drew the connection between women and other Others, most notably Jews, blacks, and aboriginal peoples.3 The place allotted these Others in Hegel's systematic philosophy is as something to be struggled with, to be overcome. Historically, they are static and doomed to be left behind: women are creatures whose being belongs wholly to faith and the family, which will be transcended by the exclusively male sphere of the state; the colonized Other is left behind by history, as Spirit unfolds from East to West. Their stasis is the necessary ground for the evolution of human freedom in the rational male political life of the western world. Even when it appears to be overcome, however, the Other never goes away; it haunts Hegel, and forces him to re- double his efforts at every turn to erect the system and keep the darkness and chaos of the Other at bay. As we shall see, there are some intriguing events and encounters in Hegel's life that may help us to understand what I call the anxiety of system - the need to construct an imposing philosophical edifice designed to resist the danger inherent in the allure of the feminine seductive Other. Hegel was not alone in this anxiety. Panic and near despair about the enerva- tion of male potency in the face of the seemingly inexhaustible force of female sexuality, fear of the destiny presaged by la petite mort , were common in the works of European male philosophers and poets in the eighteenth and nine- teenth centuries. Susan Shell aptly describes Kant's dread of w[t]he wavering, and ultimately deflating, attractions of sensuous desire, whose objects disgust once we are sated," and his preference for "the unwavering draw of the ideas, whose Unfathomable depth' is the source of their infinite capacity to uplift us."4 In England, Percy Shelley expressed this fear more persistently than anyone else, as in Alastor; or the Spirit of Solitude (1816), in which the ill-fated poet-wanderer forsakes the love of a real woman, the Arab maiden, in search of a higher, dis- embodied, feminine ideal. In the end, the dying poet is left to pleasure himself "on the smooth brink/Of that obscurest chasm."5 Perhaps Hegel understood something of the origin of this impulse to build a system. In the introduction to his lectures on the Philosophy of History, he pauses for a moment to ruminate over the spectacle of history as "the slaugh- ter-bench at which the happiness of peoples, the wisdom of States, and the virtue of individuals have been victimized" by the "revolt of the Good Spirit (if it have a place within us)."6 In response to the "mental torture" caused by such reflections, we must turn away, toward "the more agreeable environment of our individual life," or the more philosophical conviction that the apparent tragedy</page><page sequence="3">Nicholas A. Germana 93 of human history is part of some master-plan, the end goal of which is the greatest possible good.7 As will be seen, the necessity of holding back the dark, chaotic, nebulous unknown, along with its seductive power, is a central feature of Hegel's philosophy, and it is in this context that we can best understand the place of India and "woman" in his thought. As Frederick Beiser and others have rightly argued, Hegel's formidable philosophical system was grounded in his inescapable historicism. For Hegel, history was the unfolding of Spirit in the world, aiming at its full realization and actualization through human freedom: "In the process before us, the essential nature of freedom - which involves in it absolute necessity - is to be displayed as coming to a consciousness of itself [...]. Itself is its own object of attainment, and the sole aim of Spirit. The result it is, at which the process of the World's History has been continually aiming."8 The fullest realization of Spirit in World History, according to Hegel, is in the modern (Prussian) state: "The march of God in the world, that is, what the state is. The basis of the state is the power of reason actualizing itself as will."9 The dialectical nature of the historical unfolding of Weltgeist necessitates that, as history moves forward, the moments that make up the thesis and antithesis in any given age are overcome and left entirely behind - the Hegelian Aufhebung. Since the end toward which Spirit is evolving is absolute self-knowledge, human history is a progression from a state of static ignorance toward dynamic self-rec- ognition embodied in the modern state. In the spirit of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, Hegel characterizes these poles of historical development as eras of darkness and light respectively. Despite his professed dislike for indeterminate language in philosophical works, the rhetorical contrast between light and dark- ness (as well as countless other metaphors) are pervasive in Hegel's books and lectures.10 It is in the seemingly impenetrable darkness that Hegel locates the Other, and it is only by overcoming the darkness through dialectical struggle that the light of self-recognition and thus human freedom will triumph. "Woman" and India, in Hegel's view, both occupy a place outside of his- tory, actually prior to the beginning of the dialectical progression of historical development. In his lectures on the Orient in the Philosophy of History , Hegel proclaims that, "[w]hile the ante-historical is that which precedes political life, it also lies beyond self-cognizant life."11 And so it is with India, as he later argues: The spread of Indian culture [from South Asia to Greece and Europe] is prehistorical, for History is limited to that which makes an essential epoch in the development of Spirit. On the whole, the diffusion of Indian culture is only a dumb, deedless expansion; that is, it presents no political action. The people of India have achieved no foreign conquests, but have been on every occasion vanquished themselves.12 It is not without ground that Hegel should argue that historical development can only be found where there are recognizable political institutions.13 In both</page><page sequence="4">94 German Studies Review 34/1 (2011) the Phenomenology of Spirit (1806) and the Philosophy of Right (1821), as well as his lectures on the Philosophy of History (1822-183 1), Hegel argues that po- litical institutions were evidence of at least some degree of Spirit's recognition of itself through human freedom and human action.14 The absence of political institutions in ancient India precluded the possibility of "self-cognizant life," and thus forced ancient Indian culture to remain undeveloped, prior to and outside of history. The same is true of woman in Hegel's philosophy, and for the same reasons. In the Phenomenology and Philosophy of Right, Hegel contends that human society is divided into two spheres - the spheres of the Divine law and human law.15 These spheres must come into conflict with one another, and the dialectical resolution of this conflict, ixsAufhebung , is the emergence of the masculine public political sphere of realized Spirit and human freedom.16 Originally, as members of a family, both men and women are part of the sphere of Divine law. It is, in fact, the role of the family to defend the Divine law against the claims of the human law. While man will eventually break out of the family, and initiate the dialectical struggle that will result in the fullest realization of human freedom and dignity, woman essentially belongs to the Divine law and the family and is inseparable from them. Hegel recognizes the family as an "ethical community" because in the family each member recognizes him or herself in each other, thus seeing one another as self-in-other. For Hegel, the purest form of this relationship is that between brother and sister, where there is a genuine recognition of identity-in-difference, devoid (he claims) of the obstacle of erotic desire, and it is consequently in her role as sister that woman achieves her highest ethical state.17 The ethical life of the family, however, is not a "self-cognizant" one: [T]he feminine, in the form of the sister, has the highest intuitive awareness of what is ethical. She does not attain to consciousness of it, or to the objective existence of it, because the law of the Family is an implicit, inner essence which is not exposed to the daylight of consciousness, but remains inner feeling and the divine element that is exempt from an existence in the real world.18 It is man who separates himself from the dark, unconscious life of faith and the family, and ventures forth into the public arena where he will enter into the "daylight of consciousness" and give expression to the self-consciousness of Spirit in the "real world" through political life.19 Understood in terms of dialectical development, the civil society established by man as he breaks from the family stands in opposition to the ethical sphere of woman. The historical conflict between these spheres resolves itself in the higher ethical life of the state, which is the highest ethical state possible since it represents the absolute self-consciousness ofWorld Spirit through human political institutions.20 "Since the state is mind objectified," he writes in the Philosophy of Right, "it is only as one of its members that the individual himself has objectivity, genuine individuality,</page><page sequence="5">Nicholas A. Germana 95 and an ethical life."21 Curiously, while the state is supposed to constitute the synthesis of the feminine family and male civil society, each of which is "one-sided" on its own, political life in the state is still clearly dominated by male rationality and resembles civil society far more than the family.22 Whatever her role in the state, woman clearly does not share in the self-cognizant political life of man: "When women hold the helm of government, the state is at once in jeopardy, because women regulate their actions not by the demands of universality but by arbitrary inclinations and opinions."23 Woman can never make a break from the family, can never enter into the light of self-consciousness in the political sphere, and can conse- quently never enter into historical development. This is so, he argues because: [OJne sex is mind in its self-diremption into explicit personal self-subsistence and the knowledge and volition of free universality, i.e. the self-conscious- ness of conceptual thought and the volition of the objective final end. The other sex is mind maintaining itself in unity as knowledge and volition of the substance, but knowledge and volition in the form of concrete individuality and feeling. In relation to externality, the former is powerful and active, the latter passive and subjective.24 Robert Pippin has recently raised some compelling questions about Hegel's conception of agency. He has placed particular emphasis on the importance of what he calls Hegel's "theory of recognition."25 In this reading of Hegel's practical philosophy, genuine freedom (ideally realized in the state) is not a question of pure ontological status, but rather a socially and historically realized condition necessitating recognition by others, who are in turn recognized as free agents - "being a free rational agent consists in being recognized as one."26 This formulation raises important questions about the status of woman in the state, not just in its historic, but also in its idealized form. The state, Hegel claims, is "absolutely rational" insofar as it is the result of "the substantial will" that "has been raised to the consciousness of its universality."27 Woman, however, by her very nature, cannot attain such consciousness, as her "knowledge and volition" is strictly limited by her "concrete individuality and feeling." In this account, the gendered character of the family and civil society are not aufgehoben - the state is no less gendered than its presumably "one-sided" predecessors. In his lectures on the Philosophy of Nature (published as part of the Ency- clopedia of Philosophical Sciences in three editions - 1817, 1827, and 1830), Hegel makes it clear that woman's fate is evident in her biology. Here he holds that the sexual organs of men and women are made up of the same matter; what determines the differences in form for Hegel is the difference in the essential natures of male and female: "The difference is, however, that in one or the other of these genitals, one or the other part is essential; in the female this is neces- sarily the undifferentiated element, while in the male it is the sundered element of opposition."28 In women "[t]he clitoris [...] is inactive feeling in general; in the</page><page sequence="6">96 German Studies Review 34/1 (2011) male on the other hand, it has its counterpart in active sensibility, the swelling vital, the effusion of blood into the corpora cavernosa and the meshes of the spongy tissue of the urethra."29 Hegel then sums up: "On account of this dif- ference, therefore, the male is the active principle, as the female remains in her undeveloped unity , she constitutes the principle of conception."30 Woman's place in society is mirrored or presaged in her anatomy. The essential ethicality of woman is based on intuition, or "feeling," which both explains and is explained by the fact that she is undeveloped, both physically and spiritually. Her ethicality resides in the darkness, which is impenetrable by the "daylight of consciousness." This consciousness is masculine and comes into being only when man's membership in the family is severed with the histori- cal emergence of economic and political public life. In describing the contrast between these spheres, Hegel turns again to the contrast between light and darkness: "For the commands of government have a universal, public meaning open to the light of day; the will of the other law [the Divine law], however, is locked up in the darkness of the nether regions "31 In the Philosophy of Right, Hegel employs another metaphor to describe the essential distinction between men and women: "The difference between men and women is like the difference between animals and plants. Men correspond to animals, while women corre- spond to plants because their development is more placid and the principle that underlies it is the rather vague unity of feeling."32 It is worth noting that here, in his comparison of women to plants, Hegel refers to the development of women as being "more placid" than men, while in his discussion of female reproduc- tive anatomy he describes women's "undeveloped unity." In one case there is development, though one that is passive and presumably unwilled, whereas in the other Hegel speaks of the total lack of development. It is difficult to explain why Hegel used slightly different phrasing in these cases, but I suspect that the difference may be the result of the metaphor of plant life he was employing in the passage from the Philosophy of Right , which required him to speak in terms of organic growth or development. In his lectures on the Philosophy of History, Hegel claims that China and India too "remain stationary, and perpetuate a natural vegetative existence."33 In particular, he describes the "Flower-life" of India. In this passage (which in- cludes the quote from the top), Hegel ties India and woman together through the metaphor of flowers. He describes the "beauty of a peculiar kind in women" as possessing a "more refined bloom" than the ordinary "complexion of mere health and vigor." In the "Flower-life" of India, "its whole environment and all its relations are permeated by the rose-breath of the Soul, and the World is transformed into a Garden of Love."34 As with the intuitive ethical life of woman, the Flower-life of India, in which "we have only the soul in a state of emotion," is impenetrable by the daylight of reason - "Hindoo Nature" is "Spirit in the state of a Dream," out of which we must awaken.35 When one does finally awaken from the roseate dream of Indian life, he (I use this gendered pronoun intentionally)</page><page sequence="7">Nicholas A. Germans 97 can "examine it in the light of Human Dignity and Freedom [and he discovers that] the more attractive the first sight of it had been, so much more unworthy shall we ultimately find it in every respect."36 There is a danger lurking in the beauty of the Other. It has a seductive power that lures in the unsuspecting observer, and unless he can overcome its seductive force with reason he is in danger of being entirely consumed. Just as the dark, static realm of the Divine law is overcome by the emergence of political life in which Spirit becomes "self-cognizant," India represents a stage to be overcome by the progress of history. This came, for Hegel, as Spirit continued its arc from east to west and began to realize itself in Persian culture: "[H]ere in Persia first arises that light which shines itself, and illuminates what is around; for Zoroaster's 'Light' belongs to the World of Consciousness - to Spirit as a relation to something distinct from itself."37 In the Zoroastrian opposition of the forces of Light and Darkness, Hegel sees the first historical recognition of the dialectic.38 Naturally, one result of the light of consciousness, of Spirit's self-cognizance, is the emergence in Persia of "personal dignity," as each person recognizes "that Abstract Good, to which all are equally able to approach, and in which all equally may be hallowed."39 The differentiation of light and darkness as the fundamental principles of Persian religion marks a historical advancement over the stagnation of Indian thought. Likewise, the differentiation of male sexual organs marks a necessary advancement in the history of the organism over the "undifferentiated unity" of the female sex. In woman and India, Spirit can never attain self-cognizant life because they remain inexorably locked within the un-self-conscious realm of mere feeling, and are consequently excluded from the possibility of histori- cal development. The vital force of the dialectic is the principle of opposition, which is nowhere present in woman or Indian culture. Woman's being in the world is, as we have seen, grounded in faith and re- ligion. Hegel's understanding of the nature of religion and religious thought made him a controversial figure and brought on charges of atheism by the orthodox religious and political factions in Prussia following his appointment in Berlin.40 In his lectures on the History of Philosophy, delivered and revised repeatedly from 1805-1830, Hegel argued that while religion and philosophy have the same object - God - "in the progress of culture in time [...]. Religion precedes the appearance of Philosophy," which is to say that religion belongs to a stage in the development of World-Spirit that eventually be surpassed by philosophy.41 Hegel makes it a point to underscore the distinctions between religion - and religious thinking - and philosophy. While religion takes God as its object, phi- losophy marks a progression toward a higher phase of conceptual thinking that sees through the apparent distinction between being and God, subject and object. Structurally, Hegel perceived the evolution of World-Spirit in history as being constituted of a continuum of human understanding beginning with the sensuous</page><page sequence="8">98 German Studies Review 34/1 (2011) and arriving, finally, at the rational conceptual stage realized in modern western philosophy. On the more primitive end of the spectrum, in the sensuous stage, we find art, and on the further end philosophy. Religion marks a middle point in the development of World-Spirit, as it continues to have a critical sensuous element - what Hegel means when he describes historical representations of God as "myth" - but has also begun to contemplate the relationship between the knowing subject and its object, God.42 Just as World-Spirit passes through this continuum, so too is each stage in its development characterized by a progression from the sensuous to the conceptual.43 The earliest and crudest stage, i.e. the stage that entirely lacks determinateness of thought (the hallmark of conceptual thinking for Hegel), is feeling. When we have a "feeling" of our oneness with God "we have the representation of feeling as the source of this content."44 In this stage, which can't even really be described as thinking, there is no object of thought, no determination of an object in the world about which we can begin to have (conceptual) knowledge. Because there is no determination of an object, dialectical progression has yet to commence. It is here in the nebulous world of "feeling," where Spirit has scarcely even begun to become aware of itself, that we find woman and India in Hegel's system. In the lectures on the History of Philosophy, Hegel argues that "Indian culture is developed to a high degree, and it is imposing, but its Philosophy is identical with its Religion."45 In a critical review of Wilhelm von Humboldt's addresses on the Bhagavad-Gita before theAkademie der Wissenschaften in 1825 and 1826, Hegel refuted the claim that yoga deserved the worthy name of philosophy because, unlike the "deep scientific contemplation of an object [...] Yoga is, in reality, an absorption entirely without content ," by which he means that there is no determinate object towards which it is focused.46 In his description of India from the lectures on the Philosophy of History, noted above, Hegel states that here "we have only the soul in a state of emotion." In his lectures on the Philosophy of Religion, he classifies Hinduism as a "determinate religion," because of the cultus surrounding the pantheon of Hindu deities, but he continues to describe Hindu and Buddhist meditation practices as forms of content-less absorption or nihilism ("[t]he highest point in this cultus is the state of being dead to the world").47 Likewise, woman is defined as an ethical being by her intuitive feeling, as opposed to rational understanding, for religious and ethical truths. She is trapped in a stage prior to the development of a determinate object of the Divine, in a world where ethicality is the product of her sense of the indeterminate unity of the family, in which all are one. As will be seen below, for Hegel the next step in the progression of Spirit can only take place in relation to the progression of Spirit out of the family and into the objectified realm of the rational male public sphere. For Hegel, this historical progression of Spirit continued in the ancient world on its westward track, through Persia, until it reached Greece: "It is here first</page><page sequence="9">Nicholas A. Germana 99 that advancing Spirit makes itself the content of its volition and its knowledge."48 Not coincidentally, it was in the Greek world that Hegel found the embodiment of the struggle of the intuitive, feminine family sphere and the self-cognizant, masculine sphere of human law in the tragedy of Sophocles' Antigone. It was Hegel's contention (aptly critiqued by Patricia Jagentowicz Mills) that the clash between Antigone and Creon, and its resolution in (what Hegel reads as) Anti- gone's admission of guilt, marks a decisive moment in the progression of Spirit, as the barrier between these realms is affirmed by her (supposed) allocution.49 Hegel's understanding of the historical significance of the Greek world can be seen in how he contrasts it with the dream-life of India. He is especially concerned to draw a contrast between the opium-like haze depicted in ancient Indian art and the firm, rigid, linear rationality of art in the Greek world: "A healthy intel- lect does not tolerate such abstractions [...]. Granted that the Indian Epopees might be placed on a level with the Homeric [an assertion made by Herder and Friedrich Schlegel], on account of a number of those qualities of form [...] yet the infinite difference of matter remains." He continues, "[t]here is not only a classical form, but a classical order of subject matter; and in a work of art form and subject-matter are so closely united that the former can only be classical to the extent to which the latter is so." He summarizes by adding that the " Rule is the essence of Reason ."50 The orderliness of Greek art stands in stark contrast to "Hindoo Mythology [in which there is only a] wild extravagance of Fancy, in which nothing has settled form; which takes us abruptly from the Meanest to the Highest, from the most sublime to the most disgusting and trivial."51 In Indian art, "the Divine is [...] made bizarre, confused, and ridiculous."52 The distinction Hegel makes between Greek and Indian art is echoed in his lectures on the Philosophy of Religion. Whereas Hindu (and Buddhist) meditation practices are entirely devoid of content, and hence essentially nihilistic, Greek religion is closer to the conceptual end of the continuum of Spirit's progres- sion, and is consequently closer to modern, rational philosophy. It is in Greece, he proclaims in the lectures on the History of Philosophy, that philosophy was born and "European manhood came to be at home with itself and to look upon itself," to become self-aware.53 Greek religion, with its anthropomorphic deities, honors the human subject and announces his freedom, in contrast, Hegel says to the "Hindus, where the relationship of the subjects - even when of the highest sort - is only the sacrifice or negation of their consciousness."54 The "substantial foundation" of Greek religion, he argues, is "rationality in general, the freedom of spirit or essential freedom."55 This new stage in human history, in the unfolding of World-Spirit, corre- sponds to and is inseparable from the development of a new form of (rational male) political life among the ancient Greeks. Hegel's reading of Antigone points to this progression of Spirit out of the realm of indeterminate feeling and in- tuition and into an objective form in the public sphere. It is Hegel's misreading of the play, however, which interests me here. As Mills has argued, Antigone's</page><page sequence="10">100 German Studies Review 34/1 (2011) actions can (and should) be read differently, in a manner contradictory to the way Hegel suggests. Through Antigone's civil disobedience, w[h]er move out of the family transforms her so that she has the potential to be a particular self."56 Such a move would be problematic for Hegel's system of thought. As Other, woman must provide the static, un-self-conscious world against which dynamic man can define himself.57 Of itself, this problem would be enough to explain why Hegel appears to willfully misread the play and its title character. However, considered also in the context of Hegel's writings about India, such a misreading on his part begs another question - about the purpose of the system itself and the anxiety it is designed to counter. As David Ferrell Krell argues, one fruitful way to get at Hegel's views on "woman" is to come at it from a different angle, not from Hegel's reading of Antigone (which Hegel praises as "one of the most sublime representations of this virtue [family piety],") but from his derisive comments on another liter- ary woman, Friedrich Schlegel's Lucinde.58 The love affair that is depicted in Schlegel's scandalous novel (published in 1799) defies the ideal relations be- tween the sexes as Hegel defines them in his system. The main characters, the young and naive Julius and the older and indomitable Lucinde, unashamedly revel in the ecstasies of romantic and physical love while in the unmarried state. Schlegel's novel celebrates the idea of a genuine love-marriage, into which both partners come freely and joyfully. Marriage is the product of love. In essence, the marriage is the love, and Julius and Lucinde do not feel compelled to have their union blessed by some high official in a formal ceremony. While Hegel was no defender of pre-arranged marriages, his conception of love and marriage was fundamentally at odds with Schlegel's.59 In the Philosophy of Right, Hegel argues, counter-intuitively, that love should follow from marriage, rather than inspire it. The marriage ceremony is not a mere formality. On the contrary, it is the official ceremony itself, rather than love, that marks the es- sential meaning of marriage: "It is in the actual conclusion of a marriage, i.e. in the wedding, that the essence of the tie is expressed and established beyond dispute as something ethical, raised above the contingency of feeling and private inclination."60 Hegel had another reason for disdaining the romantic enthusiasm for free love, and it is a revealing one. Specifically citing Schlegel's Lucinde (as well as Schleiermacher's anonymous defense of the novel), Hegel argues that love before or outside of marriage necessarily makes a victim out of the woman. For Hegel, the essence of the romantic argument is that "[s]urrender to sensual impulse is [...] represented as necessary to prove the freedom and inwardness of love"; he adds that this is "an argument not unknown to seducers."61 Such relations between men and women outside of marriage make victims out of women because they are thereby deprived of their natural place in the world, within the family: It must be noticed that in connexion with sex-relations that a girl surrender- ing her body loses her honor. With a man, however, the case is otherwise,</page><page sequence="11">Nicholas A. Germana 101 because he has a field for ethical activity outside the family. A girl is destined in essence for the marriage tie and for that only; it is therefore demanded of her that her love shall take the form of marriage and that the different moments in love shall attain their true rational relation to each other.62 Hegel's ostensible objection to premarital relations is that they deprive a woman of her natural dignity as a member of the ethical community of the family, the only ethical community to which she can belong. However, Hegel's emphasis on "surrender to the sensual impulse" and the "contingency of feeling" point to an- other reason, as does his reference to Schlegel's novel - the fear of seduction. Clearly, Lucinde had a deep impact on Hegel; his attack on the novel and its author in the Philosophy of Right came more than 20 years after Lucinde's publication. Despite Hegel's objection about the argument of seducers and the victimization of women in extramarital sexual relations, it is Lucinde who domi- nates the relationship with Julius. She is the older, more experienced partner, and he is the youthful initiate. He is under her control, a victim of his sensual impulses. Lucinde's power, the sexual power of woman, stands in sharp contrast to Antigone's fate. In the Greek tragedy, the feminine Divine law comes up against and is limited by the power of the masculine public sphere. The distinction be- tween these spheres, and the sexes' roles within them, are reified by Antigone's supposed confession of guilt. In Lucinde , the sexual power of woman dominates man completely. Under these circumstances, neither woman (who is destined for marriage) nor man (who is destined for the self-conscious public sphere) attains membership in her or his proper ethical sphere. This concern about the consequences of giving in to the temptation of an alluring older woman had real import in Hegel's own life, as will be seen below in the case of his affair with his older, married landlady Christiana Burkhardt. This affair, and its consequences, threatened to derail Hegel's personal and professional ambitions at a critical time in his career. The "Flower-life" of India also represents a threat to the security of Hegel's philosophical system, and for the same reason - it represents the threat of un- knowable, uncontrollable female sexual power. Like women, ancient India pos- sesses that "beauty of a peculiar kind" that can lure in the observer, entrancing him, making him forget that "the more attractive the first sight of it had been, so much the more unworthy shall we ultimately find it in every respect." This is the "beauty of enervation in which all that is rough , rigid , and contradictory is dissolved , and we have only the soul in a state of emotion."63 The threat to male potency is clear. The uncontrollable has to be managed, contained, and overcome. In the case of India, Hegel allows himself to give expression to a more extreme form of control - male sexual/imperial domination: And as in this silent way, Northern India has been a centre of emigration, productive of merely physical diffusion, India as a Land of Desire forms an</page><page sequence="12">102 German Studies Review 34/1 (2011) essential element in General History. From the most ancient times down- wards, all nations have directed their wishes and longings to gaining access to the treasures of this land of marvels, the most costly which the Earth presents [...]. The way by which these treasures have passed to the West, has at all times been a matter of World-historical importance, bound up with the fate of nations. Those wishes have been realized; this Land of Desire has been attained; there is scarcely any great nation of the East, nor of the Modern European West, that has not gained for itself a smaller or larger portion of it.64 In the modern West, the English took possession of the treasures of India, for "it is the necessary fate of Asiatic Empires to be subjected to Europeans."65 The allure of India has made it the object of imperial desire, and the only real role India has played in history is through the history of its (her) conquest and domination. The projection of male sexual domination in the imperial context underlines the inescapable connection between sex and power. But who really possesses the power? In Entile, Rousseau raises this question in his discussion of heterosexual sex when he observes "that the stronger [sex] appears to be master but actually depends on the weaker." He continues: This is due not to a frivolous practice of gallantry or to the proud generosity of the protector, but to an invariable law of nature which gives woman more facility to excite the desires than man to satisfy them. This causes the latter, whether he likes it or not to depend on the former's wish and constrains him to seek to please her in turn, so that she will consent to let him be the stronger. Then what is sweetest for man in his victory is the doubt whether it is weakness which yields to strength (force) or the will which surrenders. And the woman's usual ruse is always to leave this doubt between her and him.66 The chief charm of man's victory is the fact that he is not quite sure if the woman has actually consented to sex, or if he has raped her (a possibility denied by Rous- seau). And why is this uncertainty so desirable? If women are really the weaker sex, if they are little more than grown-up children who are powerless to defend themselves, what would be the charm in such a victory? In fact, it can only be a victory if it is the overcoming of someone or something powerful. Rousseau assents to the power women have over men time and again, as in the passage above and elsewhere in Emile when he marvels at the power women have to "arouse men's senses and reawaken in the depths of their hearts the remains of ardors which are almost extinguished." It is not difficult to imagine, he writes, that in some "unfortunate region," the men, rendered entirely dependent by the potency of women's charms, "would finally be their victims and would see themselves dragged to death without ever being able to defend themselves."67</page><page sequence="13">Nicholas A. Germana 103 There is evidence from Hegel's biography that may serve to shed some light on the apparent anxiety about seduction and the sexual power of women that I have attempted to locate in his system of philosophy. There are two women, in particular, whose relationships with Hegel left a deep impression at a critically formative period in the development of his thinking in the middle of the first decade of the nineteenth century. Hegel's break from the Romantics had an important personal as well as philosophical element, which may have played a critical role in shaping his at- titude toward that group and its attitudes, especially toward women. As a young man, Hegel served a brief intellectual apprenticeship under his schoolboy friend Friedrich Schelling. In the late 1790s, Schelling's star was very much on the rise and Hegel's close relationship with Schelling and his philosophy is evident from his role in the composition of the Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism (1797), as well as Hegel's early (1801) Schellingean essay, The Difference between Fichte's and Schelling's System of Philosophy. Schelling was personally close to the Early Romantics gathering around Jena and then Berlin in the late 1790s. One of the prominent members of this group was Friedrich Schlegel's older brother, August Wilhelm, who fell in love with and then married the political radical Caroline Michaelis Bohmer. Bohmer never really loved August Wilhelm, and her heart was soon taken by Schelling (who, at the time, was engaged to Michaelis' daughter, Auguste Bohmer). August Wilhelm gallantly aided his wife in secur- ing a divorce, her second, and, in 1803, stood aside without hard feelings as she married Schelling.68 Hegel lived with Schelling and Caroline between 1801 and 1803, and Caroline's fierce independence, her disdain for social restrictions on an individual's happiness, and her effect on Schelling's personality earned her Hegel's bitter animus. Terry Pinkard notes that "Hegel, who never had an easy time with independent women, also had a particular dislike for Caroline."69 Hegel's condemnation of Lucinde even 20 years after its publication may in part be explained by the fact that the title character of Friedrich Schlegel's novel was known to have been inspired by Caroline, then the object of August Wilhelm's affection. Lucinde was not the only product of Caroline's influence over Friedrich Schlegel. After agreeing to watch over her for his brother, Friedrich composed two essays on the role of women in culture and society that would have been thoroughly objectionable to Hegel's way of thinking. The first of these works, Uberdie weiblichen Charaktere in den griechischen Dichtem (17 94), contrasted poetic representations of the feminine in classical Greek literature, which the pre-romantic Schlegel deemed to be the most natural and significant produced by the human mind. Among the ancient Greeks, Schlegel held up Sophocles as having attained the highest "poetic ideal of feminine characters."70 Schlegel cites numerous female characters from Sophocles' works, but most importantly in the context of this article, he briefly considers the importance of Antigone, offering an appraisal of her character that would not have sat well with Hegel's reading of the play. Schlegel contrasts Antigone with her sister, Ismene: "Anti-</page><page sequence="14">104 German Studies Review 34/1 (2011) gone acts; she desires only absolute good, and she achieves it effortlessly; with ease she goes to her death. All powers are perfected and brought together in her. Her character is the Divine; and when the Divine is revealed to mankind, there is seen the greatest beauty."71 SchlegePs Antigone is a Christ-like figure, whose knowing and willing sacrifice unites man with the Divine. There is no hint or admission of guilt, only the power to unite mankind with God through effortless action. While Hegel's fear of seduction may have been connected, in part, to the unyielding power Caroline had over the Schlegels and Schelling, there is another, more tempting suspect, about whom we know comparatively little - Christiana Burkhardt. In 1806, during his final year at Jena, Hegel had an affair with Frau Burkhardt, his married landlady and housekeeper. Burkhardt, who had been abandoned by her husband prior to her affair with the philosopher, gave birth to Hegel's son Ludwig, her third illegitimate child, in February, 1807. 72 Hegel lived up to his obligations to his son, possibly even offering to marry Burkhardt after it became known that her estranged husband had died. Ludwig, who was passed around several times as a boy, finally moved in with Hegel and his wife Marie in 18 16. 73 By Hegel's account, Christiana Burkhardt was no Lucinde, and he insisted to his friend Karl Frommann in 1808 that "[t]he circumstances surrounding the affair do not, as far as I can see, impugn Ms. Burkhardt. She is rather the one who has had more to suffer from it."74 If Hegel's last memory of this affair was not the irresistible power of the seductress, perhaps it was his own first-hand knowledge of "an argument not unknown to seducers." In any event, this experience with passionate indulgence and its consequences left a profound impression on Hegel and, quite possibly, his views on love and marriage, as seen above in the Phenomenology , and as was also evident in his correspondence with his future wife Marie von Tucher. In a letter to his fiance from the summer of 1 8 1 1 , the year of their marriage, Hegel reminds Marie that "marriage is an essentially religious bond." "To be complete," he continues "love requires a still higher moment than that in which it consists merely in and for itself. What perfect satisfaction - i.e., being entirely happy - means can only be completed by religion and a sense of duty."75 Reading these lines, and keeping in mind the possibility that Marie was at this late date still unaware of Hegel's affair, "one suspects," along with Clark Butler, "that he is still suffering from the bad conscience he expressed in 1 808 regarding Christiana Burkhardt."76 Whatever influences might be attributed to circumstances in his personal life, it is clear enough that Hegel took the elaboration of his system very seriously, and dedicated his professional energies for more than 2 5 years to its establishment. In a letter to his friend Niethammer of 1819, the year after his appointment in Berlin, he declared, "[a]s a professor I have only begun. Much still remains to be achieved for me and the Cause."77 The campaign for his "Cause" had been launched in Berlin from the moment of his arrival, and the principle targets of Hegel's offensive were the Romantics. The Romantics had been the objects of</page><page sequence="15">Nicholas A. Germana 105 his barbs since 1 806, and would continue to be his primary adversaries until his premature death in 183 1. While he railed against Schleiermacher's theology in Berlin in the 1820s, it was Friedrich Schlegel above all others who represented for Hegel the degeneracy of the Romantic movement. We have already seen Hegel's attack on Schlegel's Lucinde from the Philosophy of Right, his first major work of the Berlin period. In his lectures on the History of Philosophy, Hegel associated Friedrich Schlegel directly with "[t]he utter despair in respect of thought, of truth, and absolute objectivity [...], [which] induced the noble soul to abandon itself to feeling and to seek in religion something fixed and steadfast; this steadfast basis, this inward satisfaction, is to be found in religious sentiments and feelings," i.e., in the realm of the feminine.78 As if Friedrich Schlegel's attitudes toward women and religion, especially Catholicism, weren't enough, he was also the author of the influential 1 808 essay On the Language and Wisdom of the Indians , which had sparked the passion for Indian philosophy, religion, and literature that led to the growth and eventual professionalization of Indology and Sanskrit studies in Prussian universities in the 1820s. The arrival of Indology in Prussia was marked by the appointment of A.W. Schlegel at Bonn in 1818, where he became the first scholar to teach Sanskrit in a German university. Hegel's opposition to romantic Indomania took the form of the diminution of India's philosophical, religious, and historical im- portance in world history.79 Hegel dedicated his own first offering to the partisan JahrbUcherfurwissenschaftlicheKritik to rebutting Wilhelm von Humboldt's praise for the Bhagavad-Gita . His lectures on history, philosophy, and religion right up to the last year of his life continued to reflect his contempt for the Romantics and their advocacy of new ideas about the relationships between the sexes and toward the philosophical and religious heritage of ancient India. What I have attempted to do in this essay is to open up a new avenue for considering Hegel's system of philosophy through an examination of his at- titudes toward woman and ancient India. While the relationship between these subjects is by no means obvious, and has not been taken up by other scholars, it is my contention that there is an important connection between them that reveals something fundamental about Hegel's motivation for the construction of such a remarkable system of thought. Both "woman" and India represent the dark, nebulous, and unknown, which stand in opposition to the light of male rationality. The telos of History for Hegel is the overcoming of these Others. This is no mere positivism, however. The unknown is not simply inferior and destined to be outdated - it is supremely threatening and has to be contained. There is a seductive power to the Other; it possesses a "beauty of enervation" that, if not recognized and rejected, can consume and annihilate the uncritical (male) admirer. In the form of Lucinde or the flower-life of India, the Other has the power to trap man, to rob him of human (read "male") dignity and freedom.</page><page sequence="16">106 German Studies Review 34/1 (2011) 1 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, The Philosophy of History, trans.
