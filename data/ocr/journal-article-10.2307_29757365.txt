<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Perennial Message of 'the Goddess' Enduring Themes down the Ages in Bactria by David Scott Bactria, a central nodal point on the old Silk Route, nestling around the upper Amu Darya (Oxus), nowadays divided between North Afghanistan and the southern parts of Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan, saw many religious traditions on its soil ? of which an early and long enduring one was that of the Goddess. Yet, the genesis of the Goddess is shrouded by the mists of time. If we are using sacred texts we need to realise that even the earliest of these like the Rig Veda, early Avesta and Middle Eastern sources are themselves already the result of many centuries of evolution, within which the more archaic spirituality has already been overlaid to a greater or lesser extent with later accretions and re-interpretations. Archaeology can take us back to those archaic times before literacy but the evidence gathered suffers from its fragmentary, isolated, or ambiguous nature (Frumkin 1970; Allchin &amp; Hammond 1978 for overview). Another avenue is the comparative mythological-phenomenological approach of scholars like Eliade (1958). These three avenues of texts, archaeology, and phenomenology, do give a picture of some coherence concerning the archaic roots and developments of the Goddess. When dealing with the Goddess, certain points have to be born in mind at the outset. There exists the danger, through scholastic analysis, of reducing into disparate elements or breaking apart what was often more of a single unity and integrated universe in the minds that created it. In archaic times the world appeared as very much an organic whole where intuition played if anything a greater role than analysis. As Eliade has indicated, in the archaic world everything tended to have a meaning. Natural objects were not so much adored in themselves, but rather for what they revealed of the sacred, the power centred in it, the inexhaustible life and reality that it showed. The modern distinction between sacred and profane did not really apply in archaic times and this should be born in mind. Much of the modern nuances of the very term 'spirituality' contains the notion of an opposition or tension between spirit and by implication body, this and that world, which cannot be readily applied to the spirituality of archaic times. Such general reservations are even more appropriate when corning to the genesis and evolution of spirituality centred around the Goddess as elsewhere. It may well be pointless to try and pinpoint the formal start of devotion to the Goddess if there is any validity to Jung's proposal about the Mother image being one [1] 27</page><page sequence="2">of the fundamental human archetypes stored in the collective unconscious (Jung 1959). Chronologically, one of the earliest recorded levels of human settlement in Bactria comes in the Middle Palaeolithic site of Dara-i-Khur which is dated by carbon-14 tests to c. 29050 B.C. In such early prehistoric times the mystery of life gave women and hence the female archetype a quasi-religious status, especially as man did not as seemingly yet realise his own share in procreation. Indeed from the time of the last Ice Age come extensive finds of the so-called Venus statuettes ranging from France through to Central Asia and Siberia. With abdomens of exaggerated sizes and featureless heads, they represent the mysteries of feminine sacrality, and by extension the magical-religious power of the goddess/es ? although, as the ritualistic scenes from the Lower Palaeolithic site of Zaraut-Say (N. Bactria) show, in terms of religious values the continuing pre-eminence of hunting, gave a pre-eminence to religious relations with the animal world of the hunter. As the Ice age finally finished, early Stone Age man moved out of his caves, and during this Mesolithic interlude the first steps towards harvesting of wild cereals and domestication of animals were taken ? an interlude that judging from carbon-14 tests in N. Afghanistan took place during c. 14665-8566 B.C. However hunting and its religious values still maintained their pre-eminence as the Mesolithic hunting scenes found at the Shakta caves in the Pamirs show. The crucial moment came with the Neolithic (i.e. agricultural) revolution of which early well known centres were southwest Asia, southeast Asia, and north China by c. 9000 B.C., with secondary waves spreading through the Iranian plateau into Turkmenia by c. 5500. Bactria though was itself a primary centre for the domestication of fauna, as seen at southern sites like Ghar-i-asp (c. 8566 by C-14 tests) and Ghar-i-mar (c. 6960), with the initial mixed character giving way to further specialisation into sedentary and pastoral forms. Amid the great socio-economic changes wrought by this revolution, an equally significant religious revolution took place, from which the cult of the Great Goddess emerged in forms that were to be perpetuated down the millenniums in Bactria, as elsewhere. The role of the (male) hunter was relatively downgraded or becoming more marginal in the sedentary areas while the (more female) cultivators ensued a more regular supply of food. Consequently the annual mystery or life cycle of the earth bringing forth was linked to the analogous pre-existing mysteries of life and creation centred around the woman. In other words a perceived solidarity grew up between the fertility (or power) of the land and of women. A whole series of related phenomena coalesced around the Goddess, fertility, plant life, the moon, waters and rain, all had the feature of being recurring cycles, life repeating itself rhythmically ? and they were subsumed under this dominant figure. Such rhythms revealed life in death with an inexhaustible potentiality for regeneration. This new religious vision gave rise to a sequential overlapping of the themes of Sacred Earth Mother Earth -? Mother (Great) Goddess, all of which symbolised the whole of potentiality. The Great Goddess came to personify the inexhaustible source of creation and the ultimate source of all reality. 28 [2]</page><page sequence="3">She was the expression, through myths, of an archaic intuition that there was a cosmic net in which every piece fitted and nothing was isolated from the rest. It was a spiritual vision of structural symmetry, an intuition of wholeness. The cosmological attributes of the moon, night, water, earth, seeds, birth, regeneration, resurrection were present in women. Consequently they could be actualised and increased by feminine rituals or hierogamies. Such imagery though signified something more than itself. Rather such images and rituals were a share in a transcendent reality. Life was rhythmic, there was a return from death. This then was the spiritual vision ? even if intuitively felt rather than analytically spelt out ? that the Goddess represented following the Neolithic Revolution. Thereafter as a general trend there was differentiation of the archetypal Great Goddess into goddesses. However there was always a double trend: on the one hand this differentiation into hierophanies, but on the other hand a persistent trend towards unification as those goddesses constantly returned to the Great Goddess, getting past their own later accretions of history and rediscovering that primordial vastness. Such a feature of Diversity-and-Unity perhaps makes neat academic analysis of the Goddess more difficult, but that does not detract from the inner intuitive coherence of that spirituality. It is for these reasons that while talking of individual goddesses in this study, we nevertheless will be talking generally about the Goddess tradition. As Shakespeare wrote 'What's in a name. That what we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet' (Romeo and Juliet 2.2). Such a cross-cultural identification of goddesses is a constantly recurring feature throughout the world. Apuleius in his Metamorphoses (11.5) describes such a spiritual vision of the goddess Isis who told him: 'Though I am worshipped in many aspects, known by countless names and propitiated with all manners of different rites, yet the whole earth venerates me'. Such a vision was shared in India where according to verse 10 of the Sita Upanisad: 'She has a form which is different and yet the same [...] She is All [...] She is embodied owing to the distinctions of attributes and activities. She assumes the forms of gods, sages, men'. The practical result of this spiritual vision was that throughout the world goddesses have been specifically identified with each other. A clear example of this comes with the hymn to Isis found at her ancient sanctuary in Egypt of Madinet Madi: All mortals dwelling on the infinite earth Thracians and Greeks, even barbarians pronounce thy blessed name, honoured by all, each in his own tongue and in his own land. The Syrians address thee as Astarte or as Nanai or as Artemis... The men of Thrace 'Great Mother of the Gods'. In Greece they call thee Hera throned on high or Aphrodite, or well-meaning Hestia Rhea or Demeter. For thou art, and thou alone all the goddesses which diverse people call by diverse names. In India the Devi M?h?tmya proclaimed in a similar way the identity of Devi (lit. 'the goddess') to other female deities like Sarasvati, Durg?, Laksmi, etc.). Thus, [3] 29</page><page sequence="4">individual goddesses could be, and were, capable of being seen as but part of a whole, the wholeness of the Goddess. Bactria, like the other parts of Central Asia (Turkmenia, Margiana) witnessed the impact of the Goddess following the Neolithic revolution as shown by the overwhelming predominance of female anthropomorphic representations (medallions, amulets, seals) found by Soviet archaeologists. Masson and Sarianidi analysed terracotta figurines, predominantly female, found along the Amu Darya ? singling out during the Bronze Age various aspects of the Goddess; namely a mother goddess, a goddess of heaven, of plantation, of water, and perhaps of wisdom (Masson &amp; Sarianidi 1973). Related archaeological results have come in S. Afghanistan at Mundigak, especially phase-3 (c. 3745-2800 B.C.) where the humped bull and female terracotta figurines were very prominent and popular. Amid such differentiation it was still possible for such specific goddesses, isolated by Masson and Sarianidi, to retain features of the more transcending unitary Great Goddess. Throughout the sedentary areas of Central Asia and Afghanistan a general hiatus occurred in the production of such female anthropomorphic representations around the start of the second millennium B.C. (e.g. Namazga-6 and Mundigak-5 levels). This may well be connected with the coming of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-Europeans out from the steppes of Central Asia, bringing with them their own patriarchal values and little developed tastes for anthropomorphic renderings, which tended to outwardly erase the established patterns of the early occupants. Nevertheless the Goddess, and her various manifestations, did not permanently vanish. Instead she returned, as Robbins (1978: ch. 2; 1980) has shown, through 'assimilation of pre-Indo-European goddesses into Indo-European society'. Within the Iranian tradition at the basic level this progression was shown in the primeval female personification of Spenta Aramaitis 'Sacred earth', who was appropriately described in the Iranian Bundahisn 26.78-79, 86, where 'the allotted work of Spendamart is the nourishment of the creatures and the perfection of every substance [...] the earth is her own material [...] He who will please or distress the earth shall have pleased or distressed Spendarmat'. Alongside her in the Avesta came other overlapping more specialised aspects of the Goddess appearing in figures like Parendhi, Asi, Cista, Zam, Druvaspa, and above all An?hit?. Artistically, throughout Central Asia the first millennium B.C. saw a re-flourishing current centred around the Goddess, as numerous terracotta finds have shown. This re-started a tradition for the popularity of the Goddess to be clearly shown to modern archaeologists, but in a curiously anonymous fashion given the lack of accompanying inspirational material. Such extensive terracotta traditions tell us that we are in the presence of a strong religious tradition based around the Goddess, with her functional qualities revealed to a large extent; but we do not know her by her local name. It is for this reason that excavators like Pugacenkova (1974) talk about the powerful, even if slightly anonymous, 'Mother Goddess/Great Goddess of Bactria'. By the middle of the first millennium B.C. such representations of the Goddess started to 30 [4]</page><page sequence="5">coalesce into a particular series of types around the middle and upper reaches of the Amu Darya/Oxus (Margiana and Bactria) (Pugacenkova 1959; Pilipko 1977). The earliest type was of a nude depiction which implied her primeval energy and sexuality in its fullest manifestation, as found in Bactria at places like Barat-tepe, Dalverzin tepe and Ai Khanum. Slightly later in the Graeco-Bactrian period, the predominant style of portrayal was of her in Greek robes but local visage. In such a style she usually carried a flower or fruit, although in some variants, as at Balkh-Aksu, she carried a mirror, probably signifying truth. Such iconographic fluidity continued down the centuries, as the religious complexes at Dilberjin show in the second and third centuries A.D. (Kruglikova 1977; 1979; Grenet 1987). One such example is the portrayal of what can best be called a fusion of the Greek Athena with the native East Iranian Goddess tradition found at the side chapel of the main temple and at the religious complex N-16. There on a large frieze we see the Greek goddess of wisdom and martial prowess Athena, readily identifiable by her distinctive 'Attic' helmet, profile, shield and cape. However, instead of her usual lance she has a mirror and Sasanian-style ribbons, of which neither belong to the Greek tradition. The mirror recalls such earlier Kushan representations of the Goddess found throughout Central Asia, while the ribbons evoke the Iranian goddess An?hit?. Riverine aspects, regality, wisdom, and martial prowess are such themes of the Goddess that come through with the Hellenic tradition in Bactria. Elsewhere in that second layer at N-16 has been found a painting of an unnamed goddess sitting on a cow with a devotee in front. It is no coincidence that throughout the Old World the cow was intimately connected with the Goddess' nourishing, procreative, bounteous, material and chthonic aspects. At yet another sanctuary, uncovered in the northwest of the town, another variant comes from the Kushan period where the goddess is shown with a diadem decorated with loops and with hair encrusted with golden inlaids. As we shall see shortly, this evokes Iranian-based representations of Ard-oxso found at Dalverzin-tepe, or even the description of An?hit? in verse 128 of her Aban Yast. Indian elements are also present with the big almond-shaped eyes and white dots or circles on the forehead and cheek which evoke Hindu caste marks. Of interest with this later motif is the earlier appearance at Tillya-tepe of an exquisitely fashioned gold pendant of Aphrodite with a clearly punched caste mark on her forehead. Such iconographic fluidity has a wider significance in pointing out the spiritual inclusiveness of the Goddess. Much of the richness and strength of devotion centred around the Goddess can thus be shown down the centuries through such 'anonymous' terracotta and mural representation that archaeology has revealed. In addition to such material there are other sources that do in fact indicate that the most powerful manifestation of the Goddess in Bactria was in the forms of An?hit?/Ard-oxso and Nan? to whom we respectively turn. They each had their own particular characteristics, yet thematically flowed in and out of each other's domains, thereby revealing the Diversity-within unity of the Goddess. [5] 31</page><page sequence="6">Anahita rose to great prominence within the whole Iranian world (Boyce 1975: 71-74). Her full title, which is in fact epithets, of Ardvi (moist/humid), S?r? (strong/mighty), An?hit? (undefiled/immaculate), links her to those primeval themes of water/fertility-power-purity which were from the very core of the Goddess' archetype. Although she came to enjoy great popularity in West Iranian circles, her earlier environment was in the east Iranian lands around Seistan and Bactria (Gnoli 1980: 56-57). Thus in verse 21 of her Aban Yast, the setting for devotion paid to her is on the slopes of the Hara, explicitly identified in the equally ancient Mithra Yast (vv. 13-14) to be the slopes of the Hindukush overlooking the Oxus, Helmand and Hari-rud rivers of those lands. Thematically, she shares much with the Indian Goddess Sarasvati (lit. 'flowing'). Indeed some scholars think that both are derived from the same common Indo-Iranian figure, but with the Iranian manifestation (rendered as Harahvati) gradually losing her original proper name in favour of her secondary epithets. Nevertheless, in the Avesta (Vendidad 1.13) Seistan continued to be called Harahvaiti, and hence by the later Greeks as Arachosia. In Achaemenid times An?hit? gained great favour under Artaxerxes (404-c. 360 B.C.). Moreover the historian Berosus, writing around 260 B.C. from Babylon (and recorded by Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus 5.65.3), commented about the raising of statues to her in Bactria, as well as other centres of the Achaemenid Empire. The famous 'Treasure of the Oxus' found along the river banks has been linked by many to such a cultic centre to An?hit? set up in Achaemenid times. In classical Greek literature we find Plutarch specifically identifying Athena to Isis at some points and An?hit? at others; Strabo identifies Aphrodite to An?hit?; while Plutarch, Strabo, Pausianus and Diodorus Siculus identified Artemis to An?hit?. Thus when Athenaeus in his Deipnosophistai (14.636) mentions 'I hear that the Lydian and Bactrian maidens dwelling beside the Halys river worship the goddess of Tmolus, Artemis, in her laurel shaded grove', we are in fact just as likely to be dealing with local worship of the kindred Iranian figure, given its location by the great running Oxus. Local Greek coins struck at Balkh by Demetrius show Artemis, who had previously been portrayed in Greek fashion by Diodotus, Artemidore and Menander. However on Demetrius' issue she appears not with her standard Greek helmet but with an eight-rayed coronet, which does not reflect Greek canons but does evoke the analogous Iranian figure of An?hit? who was described with such an eight-rayed coronet in her Aban Yast (30). Spiritually though, what did the Goddess, in her form as An?hit?, represent for devote's? The earliest literary information comes in one of the most ancient Avestan hymns, the Aban Yast (lit. Hymn to the Waters) that was dedicated to An?hit? and which contains striking imagery of her. At the visual level she was, according to verses 126-128: Ardvi S?r? An?hit?, who stands in the shape of a maid, fair of body, most strong, tall-formed, high girded, pure, nobly born of a glorious race*[...] She wears square 32 [6]</page><page sequence="7">golden earrings on her ears and a golden necklace around her beautiful neck, she nobly born Ardvi S?r? An?hit?; and she girded her waist tightly, so that her breasts may be well-shaped, that they may be tightly pressed. Upon her head Ardvi S?r? An?hit? bound a golden crown with a hundred stars, with eight rays [...] a well made crown [...] with fillets streaming down. Throughout her Aban Yast, An?hit? is approached by kings, heroes, warriors and sage for her favours, and she is the one giving success, riches and prosperity. Other more direct themes of the Goddess come through strongly. She was the mistress of the material world (v. 89), nurturing cattle (21) and crops (1), through her general power of sustenance. She was also the mistress of Nature and for that reason clothed in beaver skin which shone in silver and gold (129). She was the one Who makes the seed of all males pure, who makes the womb of all females pure for bringing forth, who makes all females bring forth in safety, who puts milk into the breasts of all females [...] who sends down by day and by night a flow of motherly waters. [2, 15]. In a sense what we see in the Aban Yast to An?hit?, despite the extra Zoroastrian overtones, is a blending of the material and spiritual which was characteristic of the bounteous Goddess. This integration and exultation of the physical processes and mysteries of nature and life was, as we discussed earlier, at the very heart of the spiritual message of the Goddess. Within the figure of An?hit? there was a holistic view of spirituality. This holisticness was not just restricted to the level of emotions or obscure intuition. Traditionally there has often been a linkage between water and wisdom, and in the Indo-Iranian world this linkage had been retained in connection with the Goddess. In India, Sarasvati was traditionally held to protect the study of the Vedas. In festivals Sarasvati was particularly connected with learning, speech, and thought ? a connection that was made by the meaning of saras being fluid or flowing. One of Sarasvati's popular epithets was mah?-vidy? (great knowledge). In the Garuda Pur?na 1.7.9, one of the manifestations of the energy of Sarasvati was medha (wisdom), an identification repeated with respect to the Goddess in the Devi M?h?tmya 1.11. Thus it is no surprise to find with An?hit?, in verse 86 of her Aban Yast, that 'the priests (athravans) who read and the pupils of the priest will beg of thee knowledge'. Spiritually then, we may consider An?hit?'s role at several different levels, all of which operated in different degrees, at times simultaneously, on any one person as they paid ritual devotion to her. At one end of the spiritual spectrum she represented a kind of insurance policy against material disaster with the hope of material prosperity for the future. In a more philosophical vein she was a repository of wisdom and knowledge, which in the clearer light of the Mediterranean world of Antiquity gave rise to the 'mysteries' of the Great Mother (Neumann 1955; Kerenyi 1967). An?hit? was the source of fertility for hoth the human race and nature, and in representing [7] 33</page><page sequence="8">this primeval force she was variously the upholder of state power, of agriculture, or reproduction, of marital and martial success and of spiritual progress. Such a paradoxical range of nuances reflect the inclusiveness of the Goddess in something approaching her full glory. Within Bactria a larger role seems to have come to be played by the goddess Ard-oxso rather than An?hit?. Ard-oxso is specifically named for the first time in the Kushan coinage minted by Kaniska and Huviska in the 2nd century A.D. (Bussagli 1951). She appears there firstly as a woman in robes, nimbate, and most strikingly holding a cornucopia (the quintessential symbol of abundance) from the mouth of which emerge sheaves of grain, which links her thematically to other goddesses like Tyche (Greece), Fortuna (Rome) and Sri-Laksml (India). In later Kushan issues, Ard-oxso appears with her cornucopia, radiate, with a diadem, and seated on a throne. Linguistically her name stemmed from the combination of ardvi (moist/humid) and oxso (sprinkling/wetting). Consequently, on the one hand Ard-oxso can be linked to the great Oxus river which came from the same linguistic root of oxso, while on the other hand she can be linked to that other East Iranian goddess Ardvi S?r? An?hit?. Indeed we can say that Ardvi-oxso and Ardvi S?r? An?hit? were at heart one and the same figure stemming from the riverine areas of E. Iran (the Oxus and Helmand rivers). An?hit? though went on to achieve wider popularity in W. Iranian circles of the Achaemenids, with her conceptual and linguistic counterpart Ard-oxso remaining more locally rooted in Bactria. Nevertheless, when we deal with these two figures we are in truth looking at the same figure. This basic identity explains why on the one hand in the Avesta, An?hit? is prominent and Ard-oxso is not; while on the other hand in the later Kushan coinage (amid its extensive range of Iranian figures) it was Ard-oxso who was prominent and An?hit? absent, as An?hit? did not need a separate Kushan portrayal since in a real sense she was already present in her related, albeit more local, form of Ard-oxso. Viewed in this light, it seems probable that the indigenous terracotta finds, mentioned earlier, of an unnamed goddess are of Ard-oxso. During the Kushan period of the lst-3rd centuries A.D., her popularity had been shown at excavated sites like Dalverzin-tepe, not only in the local coinage found there which portrayed her; but also in cultic places centred around her. Manichaean records confirm this popularity of Ard-oxso in their accounts of the missionary work of Mar Ammo, c. 260, in Bactria, which had recently been subjugated as the 'Eastern Province' of the Sasanian Empire. We hear in the Manichaean Middle Persian account, M2, as recorded by their local Denavariyya tradition in Central Asia (Asmussen 1975: 22). They had arrived at the watch post of Kushan [i.e. Bactria], then the spirit of the border of the eastern Province appeared in the shape of a girl, and [...] said 'I am called Bag Ard, the frontier guard of the Eastern Province. When I receive you, then the gate of the whole East will be opened in front of you'. 34 [8]</page><page sequence="9">The continuing popularity and retention of Ard-oxso on the Kushano-Sasanian coinage of the 3rd century A.D. that was minted at Balkh confirms this picture. Something of the protean character of Ard-oxso can be shown by the two temples centred around her that have been excavated at Dalverzin-tepe by Soviet archaeologists, and which stretch from the 3rd century B.C. through to the 2nd-3rd centuries A.D. (Pugacenkova 1978). The imagery is rich and varied and as we move through its permutations we can glimpse something of her spirituality and reactions to differing ethnic-social groups, among whom the excavator Pugacenkova sees Greeks, indigenous Bactrian (E. Iranian) and nomadic elements. The earliest representations from the 3rd-2nd century B.C., during the last decades of Greek political power, portray her in regular Greek canons of regularity and style. Following this though we see her portrayed with a very different page-boy hairstyle and slanted-looking eyes which give a much more Altaic visage and nomadic air. The Kushan period of the lst-2nd century A.D. portrays her as an enthroned goddess, holding a flower, dressed in a Greek-style robe with long Oriental-type embroidered sleeves and heavy dress collar, with rounded eyes and an oval mounted hairstyle supporting a diadem, which with its radial lines, suggests lunar symbolism. As such, she strongly resembles the contemporaneous portrayals of Ard-oxso on Kushan coinage. During the middle Kushan period, Indian cultural influences impinge as she is shown in the prayer room with almond-shaped eyes, heavy cheeks, and sensuous lips. Later representations from the 2nd century A.D. also show a synthesis of the earlier Graeco-Bactrian and 'Altaic' representations, where the goddes is seated, with a diadem and mounted hairstyle on top of which is shown a (lunar) crescent mounted on an arch (vault of heaven). Again we see the Goddess crossing cultural and national frontiers. Greek times in fact provide a good illustration of the shifting osmosis of the Goddess tradition, being picked up under different names, but showing an inner coherence. The incoming Greeks were themselves already riddled with various goddess figures from their own culture (e.g. Athena, Aphrodite), and those encountered in the Levantine Mediterranean (Isis, Artemis, Cybele, Nan?). Their encounter with the Iranian figure of Ardvi S?r? An?hit?/Ard-oxso was but the latest in a series of such encounters. Plutarch, from a distance in his Moralia (328) could claim how Alexander the Great had brought civilisation, the reading of Homer, and a reverence of Olympian deities to the Bactrians, but the actual situation was rather different. In Bactria evidence suggests a strong spiritual devotion to the Goddess among the Greeks, partly based upon their more familiar figures, but also around the indigenous forms of the Goddess. Throughout the temple 'a redans' (or, 'a niches indentees') at all levels (despite the architectural changes) were found small water channels and an extensive number of vases, of local (i.e. non-Greek) character. Thus, what we have in the heart of the Greek city of Ai Khanum is a temple complete with water channels and water jugs serving as libation vessels for a more indigenous fertility-orientated tradition (Francfort 1984). Did not An?hit?'s Aban Yast (2) proclaim how 'this river of mine purifies the seed in males, the womb in females [...]'? Was not the still [9] 35</page><page sequence="10">more indigenous figure of Ard-oxso stemming from the riverine connections that are reflected in her very name? Such a propensity for the Greeks to accept 'alien' goddesses is not surprising, especially when they consistently identified them on thematic grounds to their own more familiar figures, which was anyhow a reflection of the Goddess' own cross-cultural spirituality. Later on at Dilberjin during the 2nd-3rd centuries A.D. we have a similar phenomenon. Thus, at Ai Khanum, despite its fine Greek library and theatre, the religious remains are dominated by devotion to the Goddess. The temple 'a redans' with its triple cella is architecturally alien to Greek mores, as also was the temple 'hors les murs', but very similar to Mesopotamian structures being erected by the Seleucids to Artemis-Nan?. As Bernard's study has shown the two main temples 'hors les murs' and 'a redans' do not correspond to traditional Greek norms (Bernard 1976). Instead they are more akin to those encountered in Seleucid and Parthian Mesopotamia (themselves derived from neo-Babylonian antecedents), dedicated to various Levantine goddesses like Artemis-Nan?; Indeed it may have been the Greeks who provided the mechanism for the coming of Nan? to Bactria, with from the Kushan period onwards the primary manifestation of the Goddess in Bactria coming to be focused more and more on the figure of Nan?, who reveals yet further twists or unfolding of the spiritual themes around the Goddess. Originally she had been found in Mesopotamia as early as the third millennium B.C. Already in those early times, Sumero-Akkadian hymns were revealing her identity with other goddesses of the Mesopotamian world. She proclaimed (Azarpay 1976): Wise daughter of Sin [the moon], beloved sister of Samas, I am powerful in Borsippa, I am a hierodule in Uruk, I have heavy breasts in Daduni [...] still I am Nana. They call me the daughter of Ur, the Queen of Ur, the daughter of princely Sin [the moon], she who goes around and enters every house, holy one who holds the ordinances, she take away the young man in his prime, she removes the young girl from her bedchamber, still I am Nana. Wisdom, power, fertility, procreation and lunar aspects are already present in Nan?. In the Middle East she survived the fall of Sumerian and Babylonian civilisations and continued to hold allegiances right down to the coming of Islam in the 7th century A. D. Equally striking was her appearance further eastwards in Central Asia, through Parthia, Bactria, Sogdia, and the Tarim basin to the very gates of China. In Bactria Nan?'s earliest named appearance came of coins found at Balalyk-tepe and Sar-tepe, minted by an obscure petty nomad ruler, Sapadbizes, in the 1st century B. C. There, she was portrayed sitting on a lion, which follows her Mesopotamian antecedents where it represented her mastery over nature, her regal power and martial prowess. With the later Kushan coinage used in Bactria of Kaniska, Huviska and 36 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Vasudeva (II) she came clearly to the forefront. Generally she was in robes, holding a bowl, radiate, and at times with other additional features such as holding a bow and arrow (like the Greek Artemis), or sitting on her lion, or with lunar crescents above her head, and flames shooting out from her shoulders (see Mukherjee 1969 for her role in Kushan India). As befitting a high goddess her radiance denoted spirituality and sanctity, her lunar crescent were the archetypal symbols of the rhythmic cycle of life and death, of renewal and the cycles of nature and generally associated with the Goddess; her bow and arrow denoting the chase in nature and her martial prowess. Her appearance in Central Asia was not merely a repetition of that in Mesopotamia. Instead, it reveals something of the cross-cultural phenomenological appeal of the Goddess, a spiritual call that knew no boundaries. Thus, as she moved into those East Iranian areas of Central Asia she appeared to have merged with the primordial figures of Armaiti, the Sacred Earth, who traditionally had not been visually portrayed. Consequently at sites like Pjandzikent and Ustrusana we find Nan? not only with her Mesopotamian functions of love and war (and affiliation to the moon and sun), but also with the creative and chthonic aspects of Armaiti. As an extra twist, Nan? was also portrayed in Central Asia as four-armed, a feature not coming from Iranian or Mesopotamian circles, but one belonging to the Indian world, where it had the connotation of universal power as used for example in the portrayal of the Indian Great Goddess in her fiercer aspect of Rudrams? Durg?. Tibetan texts described Nan? as 'the mistress of the sphere of knowledge, the white one sun and moon, the great mistress of life' (Tucci 1963). We approach the kernel of devotion centred around Nan? in Bactria, with a Sogdian Manichaean text M549 describing cultic scenes around Zimat in S. Bactria (Henning 1944: 143-44): That in the whole demonic creation they would have success and power [...] they did much harm and power to the 'soul service'. Kuyune steps forward [...] and there takes place spilling of blood, killing of horses, laceration of faces and taking of ears. And the lady Nana, accompanied by her women, walks onto the bridge, they smash the vessels, loud they cry out, they weep, tear (their garments), pull out (their hairs) and throw themselves to the ground. Although this was written from an unsympathetic Manichaean viewpoint, and initially sounds merely like hysteria, in fact it has a ring of authenticity to it and takes us deeper into spiritual practices based on the Goddess. Such ritualistic mourning and lamentation in fact evoke most strongly the joust with death of Nan?-Istar, whereby through her initial defeat her lover Damuzi-Tammuz had to descend into the underworld. Thereby a 'mystery' was established in Mesopotamia centred around the ritual annual lamentations decreed by Nan? in the month of Tammuz (June/July), a mystery established by Nan? so as to ensure universal fertility. Thus, the young [11] 37</page><page sequence="12">vegetarian god would descend into the underworld, only to reappear, following the dark winter, in spring and so initiating the renewal yet again of the hearth. In short this became one of the most enduring features of the spiritual quests in the ancient Middle East. The Jewish prophets are heard denouncing such women weeping for Tammuz outside the gates of Jerusalem (Ezekiel 8.14) in curiously similar words to the later Manichaean text concerning such practices in Bactria. Such a view of regular periodical alternations of life and death at all levels was to institute the Levantine mysteries concerning the salvation and destiny of all after death. The divine and human levels were thereby linked. Elsewhere in the Ancient World, related forces connected with the Goddess gave rise to the Eleusinian mysteries and their initiatory rites, centred on Demeter and Persephone. In Sogdia it is significant that at Pjandzikent, in the 'Scene of Mourning' discovered at one of its temples (7th-8th century A.D.) Nan? appears as the centre of attention, amidst such ritualistic scenes of lamentation. It is at this point then that the very real spirituality that lies behind the iconographic and descriptive themes of the Goddess comes through with the very transformation of the devotee. Despite the Islamic blanket that descended on Bactria in the 7th century, archaic strands stemming from the Goddess have survived. Among the Tajik peoples, Soviet ethnologists uncovered such remaining traces (Kadyrov 1969; see also Cammann 1957). Women from the Kasha-Darya valley act at the New Year equinox as a catalyst for prosperity and good will, by their singing in the meadows and along the river banks. Earth, flowers and river water being centred around those women recalls themes of Ard-oxso. A similar process is to be seen with the suskotun rite at Gurotu and elsewhere, that centred around the intercessions of a woman (never a man) who brings on the rain. Wedding customs at the village of Varganzeh, Obi-Kandeh and Kasenah retain archaic identifications of the bride as being the moon, sun and mistress ? language which is a distant echo of the particular image of the Goddess in Bactria, as Nan? or Ard-oxso. Much more fieldwork could be done in this area, which would show no doubt further survivals of pre-Islamic strands whose genesis originally lay in the Goddess. In any history of the religious quest of mankind, the Goddess deserves treatment, in Bactria and elsewhere in the world. This is merited on account of her ancient and archaic roots. This is also merited because of her long persistence down the ages, and because of her continued cross-cultural osmosis whereby one form merged into another. Above all she deserves serious attention for her spirituality. In short for her unifying message affirming the value and intimate connection of the world and its constituent parts, with which the devotees could respond at the most immediate to the most sublime levels. To put it into a nutshell, her spirituality concerned itself with the ultimate transformation and integration of the devotee through and in this world, an attitude of interest for today's ecological problems. 38 [12]</page><page sequence="13">REFERENCES Allchin, F.R. &amp; N.
