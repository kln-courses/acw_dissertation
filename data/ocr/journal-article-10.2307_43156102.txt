<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Science Teacher Education , 8(4), 241-256 Â© 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers , Printed in the Netherlands Studying Children's Conceptions of Life: An Example of Research Carried Out by Preservice Science Teachers Pinchas Tamir Israel Science Teaching Department, Hebrew University, Jerusalem 92345, ISRAEL There is an emerging interest among teacher educators in integrating research into their teacher education programs. This interest is due to the continuing efforts of instructors to improve the effectiveness of teacher education by creating more meaningful experiences for their preservice teachers, as well as several recent developments. One of those developments is the adoption of a constructivist view of learning which requires the teacher to identify the prior knowledge of children and design instruction accordingly (e.g., Ausubel, 1968). Teachers need to find out the prior knowledge of their students, and this activity should be considered a special kind of research. Another development is the recognition of the importance of reflection in the woik of the teacher. Reflection is a part of reasoned actions. It is "the thought behind the actions of teaching not the actions themselves, that is crucial to reflection" (Copeland, Birmingham, de la Cruz, &amp; Recht, 1 99 1 , p. 11). While acquiring a reflective stance appears to be desirable, fostering reflection through teacher education has some problems. Schoen (1987) pointed out that, while novice teachers should be encouraged to engage in the reflective process, they are expected, at the same time, to acquire particular knowledge and skills considered by teacher educators to be essential to practice. For example, those who are committed to the importance of inquiry in science education would have to allocate time and resources to develop the science teacher as inquirer. Wedman, Mahlios, and Whitefield (1989) observed that most typical teacher education programs contain, within their structure, obstacles to the development of reflection .... Student teaching which is generally that part of a teacher education program in which the process of reflection is considered most appropriate, is often least amenable to change the student teacher, (p. 15)</page><page sequence="2">242 PINCHAS TAMIR A variety of methods intended to promote reflectivity have been proposed, such as autobiographical writing, reflective small group discussion, analysis of case studies, and reflective journals. Conducting research in the classroom offers yet another opportunity for enhancing reflective behavior. Teachers are so busy that they often do not take the time to look back to what has happened in their lessons. Action research that focuses on class transactions, teacher and student behavior, and perhaps other components of teaching can enhance preservice teachers' reflection and the probability of getting them to apply reflection in their daily routine as they become teachers. A third major development is an increasing interest in involving teachers in research on teaching. Phrases like "teachers as researchers," "action research," "authentic research," and "field research" have become more and more popular. Very little is known, however, on effective ways of introducing preservice teachers to research. Afourthmajordevelopmentisan increased pressureonteachereducators to be engaged in research and publish that research in professional journals (American Association of Colleges forTeacher Education [AACTE] , 1988; Wallace, 1987). This pressure has been met by resistance. Many teacher educators feel that such demands are not fair, and some are reluctant to enter into a new activity in which they have no expertise (Cronin-Jones, 1991; Keiny, 1996; Tobin, 1989). This article shows how the two aims, namely introducing preservice teachers to research and engaging teacher educators in research, may be reached simultaneously. The model, which has been used successfully, consists of four phases: 1. The teacher educator designs a study on a topic of interest to preservice teachers. 2. The preservice teachers carry out the research, and each writes a complete account. The accounts are then assessed and commented on by the teacher educator. 3. The teacher educator analyzes the pooled data and conducts the statistical tests. The teacher educator also adds the necessary references. 4. The teacher educator submits a manuscript for publication with acknowledgments (e.g. , Friedler, Amir, &amp;Tamir, 1 987; Tamir, Gal-Choppin, &amp; Nussinovitz, 1981; Tamir &amp; Garcia, 1992). The model was first used in Israel in 1976 and reported by Tamir et al. (1981). Since teacher educators in various parts of the world are trying to deal with the problem of introducing research as a component of their day- to-day work, the model was demonstrated in a science education methods</page><page sequence="3">RESEARCH BY PRESERVICE TEACHERS 243 course in Canada in 199 1 . Since the research question from the 1976 study "How do intermediate pupils conceptualize living and nonliving?" still appears to be of universal interest for science teachers, it was used as the focus for the Canadian study. Since the research methodology is clearly described in Tamir et al. (1981), the preservice teachers were asked to replicate the major part of the study, namely the classification task. The preservice teachers worked in pairs, and in addition to completing the classification task, each pair was required to study another aspect related to the conceptualization of life (Tamir et al., 1981). This article describes the 1991 Canadian study and compares the results from it to the 1976 Israeli study. The Research Assignment Purpose This study deals with the extent to which different children hold animistic notions and the meaning of those notions. More specifically, the following questions were examined: 1 . How well can children differentiate between living and nonliving? 2. What criteria do they employ in the classification? 3. Do children relate different meanings to the concept "alive?" 4. Do children relate different meanings to the same trait, such as movement, when applied to dogs or to clouds? 5. How do children conceive the continuity of life? How is this affected by the ambiguity in relating life to embryos (seed and egg)? 6. What are children's conceptions of selected aspects related to living and nonliving? Instruments A classification test was composed of 16 pictures (8 of living creatures and 8 of inanimate objects). Living creatures included a cat, a butterfly, a fish, a tree, an herbaceous plant, a mushroom, a seed, and an egg. The inanimate objects were chosen so that they possessed characteristics associated with living organisms. The characteristics were movement (a train, a river, clouds, wind), heat (the sun, fire), and respiration (air). The eighth inanimate object, a television, was chosen because a television often shows activities of living organisms. Also, it is quite common to hear or say "live on television."</page><page sequence="4">244 PINCHAS TAMIR Data Collection Interviews. The following questions were asked during the interviews: 1 . How do you decide whether or not something is alive? 2. Look at each of the pictures and decide if the thing you see is alive or not alive. 3. How did you decide that this thing is alive or not alive (according to the answer to question 2)? 4. What do you mean when you say that something is "alive?" Questionnaires. Five questionnaires were administered, each dealing with particular aspects found in previous research to include misconceptions and/or alternative conceptions. Questionnaire A was designed to find out whether the children believed that inanimate objects that were classified as living possess the ability to feel and to think. Questionnaire B was designed to test how children who classified inanimate objects as living conceived "life." Questionnaire C was designed to examine movement as a characteristic of life. Questionnaire D was designed to test how children conceived the continuity of life. Questionnaire E was designed to test how well children distinguished between mammal and non-mammal. Sample The subjects (N = 418) were studying in 16 schools in various parts of Toronto, Ontario, and its vicinity. The schools that participated in the study were those in which the presrvice teachers, who carried out the investigation, did their practice teaching. The children who participated were in grade 4 (n = 72), grade 5 (n = 52), grade 6 (n = 69), grade 7 (n = 124), and grade 8 (n = 101). Most of the children were average or above average students, although some were gifted and some were new immigrants for whom English was their second language. The number of boys and girls was equal. The study was carried out in the fall of 1991 and involved 27 preservice intermediate science teachers who conducted the research as part of their course assignments. The interviewers followed a detailed, standard form during the interviews which lasted 15-20 minutes each. Each child was interviewed individually, and all responses were recorded on prepared sheets, ready for scoring. In two cases, written responses were obtained</page><page sequence="5">RESEARCH BY PRESERVICE TEACHERS 245 instead of interviews. Data Analysis Classification of each object as living or nonliving was scored as correct (1 point) or incorrect (0 point) so that the highest possible score was 16. Subscores for animals, plants, embryo, and inanimate were also computed. Internal consistency was shown to be high (Tamir et al., 1981) with Cronbach alpha = 0.89 for the entire test. Similarly, intercorrelations among items of each subtest were very high. The reasons given by the children for the classifications were categorized as follows: A. Life Processes 1 . Growth and development 2. Nutrition 3. Respiration 4. Reproduction 5. Death 6. Movement B. Other Criteria 7. State and place (the seed is not in the soil, therefore, it is not alive; it is in the sky; it is not wilted; its eyes are open; the egg is alive when it contains a chick) 8. Form and structure (made of wood, has leaves, a glowing ball) 9. Self-activation (can move by itself, has to be lighted) 10. Function and utility (it shines, they bring rain, we inhale it, we eat it) 11. Belonging (it is an animal, it is made by man) 12. Anthropomorphism (it has a soul, it does as it pleases, it feels like a man) 13. Tautology (it is alive because it is living) 14. Insufficient (it moves but it does not respire) 15. Other reasons 16. No reasons Each response was categorized into one or more categories. For example, "It is alive because it grows, moves, and eats" was categorized as 1, 2, and 6. "It is not alive because it flows but does not respire" was categorized as 3 and 14. Percentage of agreement between two independent raters on a random sample of 40 answer sheets was 80%. Responses to the questionnaires were categorized as Yes, No, and Not Sure. The study followed a no treatment, posttest-only design. The dependent</page><page sequence="6">246 PINCHAS TAMIR variables were the ability to discriminate living from nonliving objects and to relate correctly the attributes to living organisms. The independent variables were gender and grade level. In one school, two class periods were devoted to discussion of living and nonliving before responding to the classification task. In another school, different organisms were used in the classification task. The results for children in these schools are reported separately. The statistical significance of differences between groups was determined by Chi square and t-test for frequency distributions and means scores, respectively. Results and Discussion Classification Table 1 compares the results of the 1991 Canadian sample with the results of the 1976 Israeli sample. The first Canadian sample (N = 367) represents the typical children in grades 4-8 who responded to the classification task without any preparation and no prior notice, exactly like the Israeli children 15 years ago. The second Canadian sample (N = 55) underwent a learning experience in which the indicators of being alive were discussed in class several days before the classification task. The data comparing the two Canadian samples show that Canadian intermediate school children have very clear knowledge that animals and plants are living. With the exception of the train and the television, which they clearly classified as nonliving, a substantial proportion of the children did not clearly identify the remaining six objects as inanimate. Similarly, close to half of the Canadian children did not realize that embryos were living. The differences observed in Table 1, all in favor of the second Canadian sample, may be attributed to the learning intervention that lasted two periods. Thus, it may be assumed that teachers can devote the necessary time to ascertain that the differences between living and nonliving are made clear, especially in relation to inanimate objects and embryos. In comparing the Israeli sample with the Canadian sample, there is great similarity between the two in relation to animals and embryos. On the other hand, substantial differences exist in relation to natural inanimates where Israelis outperformed the Canadians, and in relation to plants, especially the tree, in which Canadians outperformed the Israelis. The reasons for these differences are not clear. It may be speculated that the stronger tendency of Canadian children to categorize natural things as living may be an indication that life and living are conceived by Canadians more broadly, and children pick up this broader conception from the media and their environment. In</page><page sequence="7">RESEARCH BY PRESERVICE TEACHERS 247 both countries, there were no statistically significant differences by either gender or by grade level. Table 1 Percentage of Correct Answers of Two Canadian Samples Compared With an Israeli Sample Subtest Object Canada 1 Canada 2 Israel Animals 100 100 99 Cat 100 100 100 Butterfly 100 100 99 Fish 99 100 99 Plants 90 89 82 Herbaceous 91 93 86 Mushroom 84 80 81 Tree 94 95 79 Inanimate 73 83 81 Television 95 98 99 Train 99 98 91 Clouds 74 78 80 River 68 80 79 Fire 68 87 78 Air 66 82 76 Sun 54 60 74 Wind 65 84 74 Embryos 55 75 56 Seeds 56 69 61 Eggs 54 80 52 Total 79 86 82 Reasons Figures 1-4 present the distribution of reasons given during the classification task. It may be seen that, in both countries, different weights are given to different criteria for different groups. It may also be seen that, in many cases, the data of the two countries follow similar trends. For example, for animals, the four most popular criteria were movement,</page><page sequence="8">248 PINCHAS TAMIR respiration, growth, and nutrition; for plants, the three most popular criteria were growth, nutrition, and respiration; for embryos, they were growth, state and place, and belonging; for man-made inanimate objects, they were form and structure, belonging, and self-activation, and finally, for natural inanimate objects, they were belonging, form and structure, and function. The relative weights of biological and non-biological criteria also revealed similarities. For animals and plants, biological criteria were used twice as frequently for animals and about 30% more frequently for plants. The frequency of using biological criteria for man-made and natural inanimate objects was practically identical in the two countries. On the other hand, the Israeli sample provided many more non-biological criteria for classifying inanimate objects. There were several other conspicuous differences. Movement was used by Israelis more frequently for inanimate objects and less frequently for animals, and self-activation was used by Israelis twice as frequently with regard to man-made inanimate objects. Growth and development was used by Canadians about three times more frequently with regard to animals, while nutrition was used by Israelis more than twice as frequently with regard to animals. Also, Israeli children used anthropomorphic reasons more often than Canadians. Nevertheless, the general picture which emerged was that of ahigh degree of similarity between Israeli and Canadian children in the reasons they used in classifying objects as living or nonliving. There were some differences in several subsamples by grade level and gender. Generally, these differences were similar to those found in Israel, namely, older children (grades 7 and 8) differed from the younger children in the following ways: 1. They used biological reasons more in classifying animals, plants, and embryos and less in classifying inanimate objects. 2. They used movement less often in the classification of plants, embryos, and inanimate objects. 3. They used the criterion of self-activation more often. 4. They used structure, function, state, and place less often in classifying animals and plants. 5. They used state and place more often in classifying embryos.</page><page sequence="9">RESEARCH BY PRESERVICE TEACHERS 249 Figure 1.

Children who classified certain objects incorrectly may have difficulty in classifying other objects. Movement and growth were the most commonly used indicators of life; however, children realized that the movement of clouds or rivers is different from that of animals. Children in the upper grades used movement less and less. Instead, they employed more and more unique biological attributes such as nutrition, reproduction, respiration, growth, and death.</page><page sequence="14">254 PINCHAS TAMIR Formany children, the life of humans and other animals is different from that of plants, embryos, or inanimate objects. Often, children have difficulty in explaining the different meanings of life. For example, the life of dormant seeds appears to be substantially different from that of a germinating seed. The knowledge that living things develop from living things does not prevent many children from believing that seeds and eggs are not alive. Canadian and Israeli children in intermediate grades had very similar conceptions of living and nonliving as far as animals and embryos were concerned. Canadian children, however, excelled in their ability to classify plants, whereas Israeli children were better in classifying inanimate objects, as living and nonliving, respectively. One wonders whether these differences are cultural. Biology teachers need to be aware of the different meanings that children associate with the concept of life as related to different objects in different contexts. Such awareness will help teachers in explaining and in avoiding ambiguities that may interfere with learning and understanding life processes. Understanding the unity that characterizes living organisms is associated with grasping the commonality between animals, plants, and embryos. It is part of a mature concept of life and is basic to the way people see the world and understand the phenomena around them. A detailed knowledge of the criteria employed by children in deciding whether or not something is alive should help teachers in their choice of effective strategies and useful examples to improve children's understanding of life. Preservice teachers in Canada, like those in Israel, can integrate meaningful research experiences into their preservice education program which not only enriches them at the time but can have an impact on their professional development as lifelong learners. Beneficiaries There are four potential beneficiaries from a research assignment as a requirement in a preservice science methods course: (a) preservice teachers, (b) teacher educators, (c) children, and (d) regular clientele of educational research. Preservice Teachers For preservice teachers, the contribution of the assignment is three-fold. First, it provides them with an initial experience in conducting educational research. Second, it enriches their educational experiences by obtaining an in-depth view of a particular educational issue. Third, it increases their</page><page sequence="15">RESEARCH BY PRESERVICE TEACHERS 255 appreciation of research and i's potential contribution to the teaching profession. Teacher Educators As already mentioned, many teacher educators hardly do any research; hence, research productivity of teacher educators is, on the average, quite low. According to a survey in the United States, more than half of the faculty in bachelor's and master's degree-granting institutions had no published refereed articles. Faculty in the bachelor's degree-granting institutions reported an average of two published articles, faculty in the master's degree- granting institutions reported an average of three published articles, and faculty in doctoral degree-granting institutions reported an average of thirteen published articles (AACTE, 1988). It is hypothesized that if teacher educators would incorporate assignments such as the one described in this article into their methods courses, they would benefit from conducting research within their field of expertise and gain important knowledge. At the same time, they would meet the promotion criteria operating in many teacher education institutions. Projects such as the one describe here may involve the cooperating teachers who may benefit from it as well. Children The children will benefit by having more open-ended and inquiry- oriented teachers who are ready to try new approaches, learn from experience, and consequently improve the quality of teaching. Regular Clientele of Research Since research carried out by prospective teachers costs little, if any, money, a wealth of research findings relevant to classroom practices will become available. For example, the three published articles of children's conceptions cited earlier involved interviews with large numbers of children due to the large number of researchers. The data thus obtained are more reliable and more generalizable than in most studies based on individual interviews and carried out by one or two researchers. Conclusion I have suggested various ways by which research can be incorporated into preservice teacher education. It should be noted that the activities</page><page sequence="16">256 PINCHAS TAMIR suggested here aim at introducing prospective teachers to educational research. Here, like in other aspects of the profession, the preservice experiences are just a beginning. The long-term impact of such activities requires further research.
