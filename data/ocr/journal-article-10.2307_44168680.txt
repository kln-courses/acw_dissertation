<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN EMBASSY OF THE BYZANTINE EMPEROR TO THE FATIMI D CALIPH AL-MU'IZZ The Caliphate of the Fatimids, established at the beginning of the tenth century in North Africa (the « second amer- mumnes » of Constantine Porphyrogennetus) (*), engaged at times both in war and in diplomacy with the Byzantine Empire, and what I propose to do here is to give an account, from hitherto unaccessible sources, of an episode in the relations of the two ; the main document on which the following account is based, is full of curious details shedding new light on Byzantine-Fatimid relations in general. It is not so long since the existence, in the libraries of the « Bohra » sect of Ismailis in India, of remains of the old religious literature of the Fatimids became known to Western scholarship (2). Among the books of the sect there are to be found some historical works, too, and it is these that furnish the material for the present article. The qadi al-Nu'mãn ibn Muhammad, one of the intimates of the Fatimid Caliphs from al-Mahd! to al-Mu'izz and one of the foremost theologians of the Ismaili sect, wrote (probably in 351 A.H. / 962-63 A.D., the date of the last event mentioned, as far as I can see) a book bearing the title : Kitãb al-majālis wa-l-musāyarāt, i.e. « Book of Aud- iences and Voyages ». As a matter of fact, it contains an account of conversations between al-Mu'izz and al-Nu'mān, (1) « It must be known that there are three Commanders of the Faithful (io eïç apsQfiovfivsîç) in the whole of Syria (i. e. the Moslem world). The first resides in Baghdad... the second in Africa ( = Ifrl- qiya, the old Província Africa)... and the third in Spain. » De ad- ministrando imperio, ch. XXV, p. 113, Bekker.

It is more an edifying and hagiographical work than a historical one, and much of it is useless enough ; on the other hand it contains, here and there, precious pieces of information, the value of which is enhanced by the early date of the accounts, set down by an eye-witness not long after the events recorded. The other source quoted is a late History of Ismailism by a fifteenth century .Yemenite author, the 'Uyūn al-akhbār of 'Imād al-dīn Idrīs. The fifth volume deals with the three first Fatimid Caliphs (al-Mahdī, al- Qâ'im, al-Mansūr), the first half of the sixth with al-Mufizz. These volumes are partly based on books that are still avail- able to us -so for instance the Kitāb al-majālis wa-l-musãya- rat - partly on chronicles that are now lost (*). The account of the Byzantine embassy, a translation of which follows, is contained in the Kitāb al-Majãlis wa-l-mu- sãyarãt. No date for the event is given, but, fortunately, it can be fixed by the help of other evidence : the anonymous chronicle called Kitāb al-uyūn (not to be confounded with the 'Uyūn al-akhbār ) records an embassy of the Emperor to al-Mu'izz under the year 346 A.H. / 957-58 A.D. (2). There can (1) I hope to publish soon a collection of texts concerning the early Fatimids, which will contain, among other documents, those por- tions of the 'Uyßn al-akhbār that are taken from chronicles no more extant. I take the opportunity to quote here the short account of another Byzantine embassy, to be found in the 'Uyūn al-akhbār (V, 409 ; the exact date and locality are supplied from parallel sour- ces). The Caliph al-Mançûr left al-Qayrawān (on the 26th Rabf I, 335 A. H. / Okt. 946) in pursuit of the rebeli Abū Yazld. He made his first halt in Sãqiyat Mams. « The Ambassador of the King of the Rūm arrived, to inform himself of the state of the (Fatimid) realm, as rumours had it that it was in the outmost peril, overwhelmed by the (rebellious) Berbers. The Imam received the envoy and sent him away with lavish gifts. » (2) A. A. Vasiliev, Vizantion i Arabi, II, 308 and Appendices, p. 155 ; F. Dölger, Regesten der Kaiserurkunden , n° 668, p. 83.

Thanks to him we now have of this embassy, of which the barest fact only was hitherto known, a vivid and detailed account, allowing a curious, if somewhat one-sided, insight into the nature of the relations between the Basileus and the Fatimid Caliph. In the two years preceding the embassy there was some fighting between Christians and Moslems, mainly at sea. Al-Nu'mān (*) gives a few particulars that do not seem to be known from elsewhere. As is well known, the interception of a Fatimid mail-boot in 343 A.H. / 954-55 A.D. by an Omayyad vessel led to hostilities between those two rival powers (2). According to al-Nucmān, the Omayyad Caliph asked next year (344/955-56) for the help of the Emperor, who dispatched a few men-of-war, but made, at the same time, an offer to the Fatimid Caliph to withdraw his forces in exchange for a long-term truce. In a council of war, his advisers were for accepting the offer ; but al-Mu'izz, his panegyrist says proudly, would not hear of that : « God forbid ! I shall take no course but the one commanded by God, who said (Qoran LXVI, 9, Bell's translation) : « O prophet, strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites ; and be rough with them » ; or in another passage (IX, 124) : « O ye who have believed, fight the unbelievers who are near to you. » Now they are actually very near to us. We ask God's help against those criminals, the Omayyads, who ask the help of the unbelievers - their brethren - against us, making common cause with them and entering their company. What a shame and what an ignominy is this for them, in this life and in the coming one ! » The Fatimid army and navy (1) The following account goes back to the first volume of the Kitāb al-majālis wa-l-musãyarãt.

Al-Mu'izz proceeded from al-Mansūriyya to al- Mahdiyya in order to supervise personally the embarcation of an army under the command of Jauhar and al-Hasan ibn 'All, the governor of Sicily. « The Byzantine navy approached ; it met the navy of the Commander of the Faithful off Sicily ; the Omayyad navy, too, came to join the polytheists. God gave the victory to his Friend over the Byzantines, after a great battle has been fought between their army and the army of the Commander of the Faithful. Many of the Byzantines were killed or drowned. They retreated on the sea and fled before the fleet of the Commander of the Faith- ful to the Straits of Reyyo ('Prjyio(y), Reggio ; i.e. the Straits of Messina) in order to defend their country. They, however, (seil, the Fatimid fleet) met them at sea again and put them to flight. God broke their power and the army of the Commander of the Faithful landed in their country, killed many of them, burnt their towns, destroyed their churches and did to them what their heart desired. » The ' Uyūn al-akhbār quotes the word of a historian of the name of al-Hasan ibn Ja'far al-Ansārī : «The Byzantines have been beaten in a way that has not been heard of since the battle of the Yarmük » (*). The Omayyad fleet took refuge in a harbour of the West (i.e. of the North African coast), but was badly mauled by the local population ; when the news of the total defeat of the Byzantines reached them, they returned ignominiously to their bases. The 'Uyūn al-akhbār quotes also poems by the court-poet of al-Mu'izz, Ibn Hānī, celebr- ating the victory, poems which are also to be found in the Diwan of that poet (2).

Only not the whole truth ; from other historians (*) we learn that the campaign did by no means consist solely of events favourable to the Fatimids. They recount that the fleet of al-Hasan ben 'Ali, the governor of Sicily, was dispersed by a storm ; when it reassembled in Iqlîbiya (3), it was attacked by the Byzantines, who sank twelve ships and also took the Island of al-Rāhib and « a fortress in Sicily », i.e. Termini. Another expedition of the fleet, too, fended in a disaster - on its return it was overtaken by a storm off Palermo, several ships were sunk and the commander, 'Ani- mar ben 'Ali was drowned (4). At any rate, next year the Emperor and the Caliph came to terms. As we have mentioned already (5), the Kitāb al- 'Uyūn has an entry about the arrival of a Byzantine am- bassador at al-Qayrawān (i.e., more correctly, al-Mansūriyya, the actual residence of the Caliph). « In this year (seil. 346/957-58) there arrived an ambassador at al-Qayrawān, to demand an armistice from al-Mu'izz. A great crowd in al-Qayrawān went out to meet him. » In the Fatimid sources in reality to another Battle of the Straits (353 A. H. ; cf. Amari- Nallino, III, 318). On the other hand no.

STERN (the Kitãb al-majãlis wa-l-musãyarãt, the text of which is copied also in the ' Uyūn al-akhbār) we read an extensive description of this embassy. The 'Uyūn al-akhbār introduces the chapter from the Kitãb al-majãlis wa-l-musãyarãt con- taining this account with the following sentences^1) : « The ruler of the Byzantines sent to the Commander of the Faith- ful al-Mu'izz li-dln Allah (peace on him) great wealth and big presents, asking him to leave unmolested those Byzan- tines who remained in the country of Calabria, in conside- ration of an amount which he undertook to pay and of a tribute ( jizya ) to be sent to the Commander of the Faithful al-Mu'izz li-dīn Allah (peace on him) and of the release of prisoners from the East. The Commander of the Faithful considered this as advantageous for the Religion and the Moslems, after God had endowed him with power and force and given satisfaction to him and the Faithful ». The chapter from the Kitãb al-majãlis wa-l-musãyarãt, reads as follows (2). * * * A discourse addressed by al-Mu'izz ( blessings of God on him) to the ambassador of the Byzantine emperor. A Byzantine patrician, one of their noblemen, came to him as ambassador from their sovereign, the ruler of Constantinople. He brought with him, as was their wont every year, the tribute which the emperor had agreed to pay for the country of Calabria ; also many presents, vessels of gold and silver inlaid with jewels, embroidery, silk, nard and other precious articles which they have. He also delivered a letter from his master, in which the latter showed himself submissive, asking and entreating the Caliph to abstain from attacking him and begging for a truce. He also sent a great number of the pris- oners of the Easterners ; (to put it short) he sent things (1) VI, 107. - As appears from the excerpt in the book of H. I. Hassan and T. A. Sharaf, quoted above, p. 241, note 1, this sentence, too, derives from the first volume of al-Nu'mān's Kitãb al-majãlis wa-l-musãyarãt.

The ambassador kissed the earth several times before al-Mu'izz, stood up, delivered the message of his mas- ter, gave al-Mu'izz the emperor's letter and asked permission to bring in his presents. All this took place after the tribute had reached the Civil Governor Çãmil) of Sicily (2), according to the usual procedure. The Commander of the Faithful (blessings on him) gave him permission to do so and deigned to accept the presents. The main point in the (oral) message and the letter, which the ambassador had delivered, was the demand for a per- petual truce, on condition that the emperor should pay the costumary tax and tribute for the people of Calabria ; he also asked that the Caliph should send an ambassador to him, in order that he might be rejoiced and enabled to receive him in the way which behoved one like him - for, so he alleged, he had a great love and sympathy (for the Caliph). Al-Mu'izz (blessings on him) answered the ambassador in the following terms : « Religion and the canon law ( al-sharVa ) did not admit such a perpetual truce as he had asked for. Allah had sent his prophet Mohammed and set up the Imams after him from among his descendants in order to call man- (1) It suited Moslem pride to regard the sums paid by the Byzantines as tribute (to be paid, according to Moslem law, by Christians and Jews subject to, and protected by, the Caliph) ; the Byzantines themselves, however, took another view of these matters. « At times even, if Byzantium was for some reason unwilling to undertake a war, a yearly sum of money would go to Baghdad or to Preslav. The Caliph or the Tsar might call it tribute, if he chose - to the Em- peror it was merely a wise investment ; when he was ready to fight, the payment would cease » (S. Runciman, Byzantine Civilization, p. 162). (2) We must probably refer to this the entry, in the Greek texts parallel to the Chronicle of Cambridge, under the year 6464 of the Greek era (955-56, A. D.) : « Arrived (ms. Paris adds : in Calabria) the patrician Mariano and peace ( àyántj ) was made » (cf. Amari- Nallino II, 288, note 1).

STERN kind to His religion and to make holy war (jihād) against the recalcitrant till they embraced the religion or « paid the jizya, being subdued » (Koran, IX, 29), accepting thè sovereignty of the Imam of the Moslems and seeking his protection (dhimma). Truce was admissible for a fixed time only, according to what in the opinion of the Imam of the Moslems was convenient for them and served the interests of religion. If a permanent truce were agreed upon, the holy war, which was a religious duty for all Believers, would fall into abeyance, the propagation of Islam would cease and the command of the Qoran would be contravened. He told the ambassador that it would have been fitting for his master the king, holding a position as he did, not to be unaware of such important a point in the law of those with whom he corresponded, and not to ask for something which was inadmissible according to their law. The Barbarian Çilj ) (x) acknowledged the truth of this remark directed against his master, and asked that the Caliph should grant the Emperor an extension of the period of truce. Al-Mu'izz (blessings on him) answered as follows. « The answer to this is contained in the letter which we sent by your hand on a former occasion ; namely, that as long as he keeps the terms which we propose and he accepts, we shall not open hostilities against him, till he breaks the agreement or till the expiration of the period of truce between us. We shall not act in a perfidious and treacherous manner as is your custom » ; and he enumerated various instances when they had so acted. The ambassador tried to excuse his king by saying that those actions had been taken without the knowledge of the emperor, that he had disapproved of them and has punished the perpetrators. Al-Mu'izz (blessings on him) said to him ; « If it is as you say, namely that the authority of your king is being over- ridden and that he is powerless against those of his own (1) For 'ilj = Byzantine, cf. Nallino's remark in Storia, I, 465, note 1 and II, 309, note 2.</page><page sequence="9">AN EMBASSY OF THE BYZANTINE EMPEROR 247 religion who disobey him, what is the use of making a truce, as long as he is powerless and his authority overridden? Would you, or he, wish me to grant him a pact agreed upon by him and by those who consider themselves as being outside my realm (x), like his neighbours in the East, Ibn Hamdān and others ; if they will not keep the terms which I undertake with them, the pact is to be considered void (2). But as to those who dwell inside the boundaries of my realm, he as well as you know perfectly well that they have much more power to do harm to his co-religionists and subjects - in case they choose to act treacherously - than those of the East ; did he ever hear, or did you ever hear, that one of them dared to contravene an order of mine or act against it »? The Barbarian admitted the truth of these words and agreed that the Friend of God (blessings on him) was in the right ; and went on asking and entreating him. Al-Mu'izz evaded giving an answer in that matter and began to ask him how matters stood between them and the people of Tarsus and Ibn Hamdān in their wars and mutual relations. He drew out the conversation at length ; the Barbarian answered all the questions that he asked on these matters. Those present at the audience looked at each °Hier, as if to shew that they did not see what was the point in asking all those questions and discussing that subject. Then the Barbarian once again asked that the Caliph should send an ambassador to his king. He recalled how ambassadors used to be regularly dis- patched (by the Emperor) to him ( sc'l . al-Mu'izz) and his fathers, since Almighty God had given lhe rule into their hands ; and that no ambassador had ever been sent by him or by his fathers (to the Emperor). Al-Mu'izz (blessings on him) said: «People send ambassadors to other people for one of the following two reasons : either (1) The text is not quite certain at this point ; I have adopted the reading of the 'Uyūn al-akhbār. (2) The argument seems to be as follows. « I cannot guarantee tne behaviour of princes who do not acknowledge my sovereignty, and do not, therefore, undertake obligations on their behalf ; in the same way, if the local governors in Southern Italy do not follow the orders of the Emperor, there is no point in reaching an agreement that he cannot enforce. »</page><page sequence="10">248 S. M. STERN because they are in need of something or because they have an obligation towards the person (to whom they send the ambassador). We do not know, thanks be to God, that we are in need of your master or that we are in any way obliged to him ; why, then, should we send an ambassador to him ? It would be, of course, quite a different thing if we had to correspond with him in a matter touching religion. Now, although such a correspondance is permitted to him by his religion, we think he would dislike it. If we knew that he would acceed to our demand (*) if we sent an envoy in that matter, we would find it possible to send an ambassador as he, and you, have asked. We would not do that, were it not for the sake of Almighty God and His religion ; nor is it convenient for us to do so except in the case we were sure that he would acceed to our demand, because we do not think we ought to ask for anything. If it is on God's behalf, we shall comply with his demand ; because if this happened, the responsibility for its outcome would lie on him (2). We do not ask you to give a definite answer on his behalf ; it would not be fitting for you to do so ; but we shall give orders to mention (in the letter addressed to the Emperor) what we want to mention to you. So return (to Constantinople) and ascertain his opin- ion in the matter, because it is a large affair. If you learn for certain that he will fulfil our demand (3), let us know it and then it will be possible for us to send an envoy to him about this matter. We would not think it permissible to send an ambassador about anything which the world contains within its corners ; but as it is question of doing something for Al- mighty God's sake and for acquiring His reward, we do con- sider this incumbent on us. » The Barbarian said he considered this a great favour, and (1) It is not quite clear in what the « accession » of the Emperor would consist. Accepting the religion of Islam ? (Such an insinuation, impertinent as it is, is not, perhaps, impossible.) Or, perhaps taking an active part in the religious disputation conducted by letters ? (2) This last sentence is rather obscure ; does it mean that if the Emperor did not accept Islam in spite of the conclusive proofs to be adduced by the Caliph, the responsibility would be his? (3) So according to the reading of the original (Hay hi) ; the ' Uyiin al-akhbãr reads 'alayhi, i. e. « that he will give an answer to it ». (Cf. above, note 1.)</page><page sequence="11">AN EMBASSY OF THE BYZANTINE EMPEROR 249 began to praise the Commander of the Faithful, till his speech partook of heterodoxy and anthropomorphism, which is what he believes in. Al-Miťizz, (blessings on him) rebuked him for this and prostrated himself before Almighty God as became him. He pointed out to the Barbarian (the wrong he had done), in order to let him know that he was not pleased by his manner of speaking ; although the ambassador only wanted to honour him, and in his opinion such expressions were quite permissible. The Caliph (blessings on him) then asked him to retire to the place which had been set aside as his residence - which he did accordingly. The Caliph then turned to those who had been present at the audience as if he knew their innermost thoughts. He said : « Probably some of you had thought it strange that I spent such a long time in asking him about their relations with the people of the East. It is not that I just wanted to find a subject for conversation ; but I know that he is an ambassador, who has exact instructions what to tell me, what impression to try to create in my mind and which answers to give on questions which his master possibly foresaw he would be asked. So we approached him from an angle which came as a surprise to him and which his master did not know he would be asked about ; in this manner we have elicited from him answers which constitute proofs for the truth of our case : in this point and in that point. » He enumerated many of these points, which we heard them conversing about but which we did not perceive as being in fact proofs, till he (blessings on him) mentioned it - and, lo, they were weighty proofs indeed. They did not, however, become clear to those present till he mentioned them and explained them. They kissed the earth before him and showed their joy at the divine assistance and inspired wisdom accorded to him. This happened after he (blessings on him) asked them their opinion of the discourse he had held (with the ambassador) and what they thought it all meant - but no one amongst them was able to say. He then asked them if they considered that what he had said was a proof against him (the ambas- sador) and his master ; but no one amongst them knew that. He then uttered those words which I have (just) related. * * *</page><page sequence="12">250 S. M. STERN The ' Uyãn al-akhbār contains further information about the curious attempts of al-Mu'izz to convert the Emperor. « The king of the Byzantines continued to send his ambas- sadors and his patricians to the Commander of the Faith- ful showing submission and sending presents in order to obtain a truce and followed ... (x) The Commander of the Faithful al-Mu'izz li-dln Allah composed a book and sent it to him ; it contains the demonstration of the error of the Christians and proves the prophecy of Mohammed (the bless- ings of God upon him), which they deny. He quotes therein the evidence borne to that effect by the Old and New Test- aments and the Books of the Prophets. Nobody but the Friends of God (i.e. the Imams) has this knowledge, and it can be learned only from them (2) ... This book composed by the Commander of the Faithful al-Mu'izz li-dīn Allah for the ruler of the Byzantines is well known and is still in existence ». So it seems that the Caliph has actually composed a treatise for the benefit of the Emperor, containing proofs against Christianity and for Islam. The book, which was still in existence in the time of Idrls, has not turned up among the present day Ismailis of India. Nevertheless, we do have some trace ot it. In the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris there is an Arabic manuscript written by a Copt ; it contains excerpts from different ecclesiastical writings. At the end there is a short passage, extracted from a book by Paul of Damiette (who had found it in a manuscript written by a certain Ja'far ibn Muhammad - this name has been omitted (1) The copyist here marked a lacuna, but forgot to add the missing words in the margin. (2) As a matter of fact, there was no need of any supernatural powers to compose an apology of Islam ; by that time there was already available a copious literature on the subject, listing Biblical passages taken as prophesying the coming of Mohammed. (Cf. E. Fiutsch, Islam und Christentum im Mittelalter, Breslau, 1930 ; G. Graf, Geschichte der christlich arabischen Litteratur, I, 44-51 ; and especially P. Kraus, Hebräische und syrische Zitate in ismā' Īli tischen Schriften, Der Islam, XIX, 243 ff.) We have also a letter sent by Hārūn al-Rashīd to the Byzantine Emperor (of which I hope to treat on another occasion). There is no doubt that ai- Mu'izz made use of this literature in composing his treatise.</page><page sequence="13">AN EMBASSY OF THE BYZANTINE EMPEROR 251 by Massignon - ibn 'Āmir). The passage, given by Ja'far on the authority of Abu-1-Fawãris al-Husayn b. Muhammad, who in turn had it from Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Halabī, is from a treatise of al-Mu'izz named al-Risāla al-masïhiyya, that is « The Christian Epistle » (x). It contains some re- marks about the incarnation of the Divine in the Human ; this is usually taken as a reference to a doctrine of divine immanence in the Imams, which al-Mu'izz is alleged to have professed. According to all we know of the teachings of the sect, as expounded in the circle of al-Mu'izz, it is utterly impossible to attribute to him such doctrines (which were, indeed, taught by certain groups within Ismailism, but which al-Mu'izz expressly branded as heterodox). There seems nothing to prevent our assuming that the passage is actually from the treatise composed by al-Mu'izz for the benefit of the Emperor, for which al-Risāla al-Masīhiyya would be an apt title indeed ; the incarnation would then refer to that of Christ, adduced by al-Mu'izz in order to attack it. Paul of Damiette (whoever he may be), quoted the treatise, no doubt, in order to refute the objections of al-Mu'izz to the doctrine of the incarnation (5). As to the outcome of the negotiations for a truce, we quote (from the 'Uyūn al-akhbār ) a passage of al-Nu'mān : « The ruler of the Byzantines had entreated the Imam al-Mu'izz li-din Allah (blessing on him), the Commander of the Faith- ful, to grant him an armistice ; he spent great sums for that purpose. His demand was for a long truce, or even a per- petual one if that was possible. When the Imam (blessing on him) saw that it was good for Islam and the Moslems to make a truce, in order that they might collect their forces and have the strength to fight the polytheists, he deemed it advisible to grant him a truce of five years ». The truce was not, however, allowed to run to the end of the period originally fixed. AI Nu'mān informs us in the same passage that when the Domesticus (« who is the next man, in rank, to the Emp- ii) See L.

ARABIC TEXT The text is taken from a manuscript of the Kitāb al-majālis wa-l-musãyarãt [ W], written in 1897, belonging to the library of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London (see the Bulletin of the School, vol. VII, p. 34). The whole chapter was copied by the author of the 'Uyūn al-akhbãr I'ř7] (vol. VI, p. 107 ff. in the copy at my disposal, written in 1873). (1) The materials concerning the diplomatic intervention of the Fatimid Caliph in the affair of Crete are published in H. 1. Hassan and T. A. Sharaf, op. cit., p. 46 ff. I hope to study these documents on another occasion.</page><page sequence="15">AN EMBASSY OF THE BYZANTINE EMPEROR 255 (ý&gt; jW A. ^-4? l&gt; &lt;-.Ul3- fAr* ^Lb-? cr* Oir-k"! y O-^4j Ji &lt;&gt;•-*-?•.?

It is the Iftitāķ al-dawa , the main subject of which is the beginning of Fatimid rule in North Africa, and which was written in 346 A.H. / 957-958 A.D. - the very year of the embassy. The passage in question is to be found in the last chapter, a rapid survey of the history of the Fatimid rulers up to the date of the composition of the book. The following is the translation of the passage, made from a modern manuscript copy of the work. « Al-Mufizz raided the Omayyads, burning their fleet and the arsenal of their ships. He overcame Almeria with a small number of vessels. These he had sent out because of a wrong they have done and an act of injustice they have perpetrated on sea to the East, against his orders. [The last words are not quite clear to me ; they read in Arabic : li-amrin taadd.au fīhi wa-jauriri jārū fi-l-baķri ila-l-mashriqi r an ghayri am- rihi.] He raided the country of the Byzantines, carried away into captivity (the people of) Calabria, destroyed its churches and laid vaste its cities. Previously, his fleet had met the fleet of the Emperor of Calabria, engaged them and put them to flight. He then descended on the country of the Byzantines. The Commander of the Emperor's fleet, the leader of his army, paid to him tribute ( jizya ) on behalf of his co-religionists and came abashed to his court. This was a great victory granted by the bounty of God ». - While the payment of the tribute (to the governor of Sicily) is also mentioned in the account on the embassy, here we learn of an additional detail : it was the Byzantine admiral who delivered the payment (cf. above, p. 245, note 2). Moreover, perhaps one may take the last words as a refe- rence to the embassy of 346 ; in this case we would learn that the admiral was also sent as the envoy of the Emperor to the Caliph.</page></plain_text>
