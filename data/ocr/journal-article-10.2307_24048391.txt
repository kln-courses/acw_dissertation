Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 1989. 277 pp., color and black-and-white ills. DM 190. This excellent work, edited by Karl Jettmar, is a most welcome addition to scholarly knowledge on this subject. In a lengthy introduction Jettmar gives a brief history of the German-Pakistani col laboration from 1979 to the present, noting that he first persuaded Dr. A. H. Dani to accompany him on a field trip up the celebrated new Ka rakorum Highway to the Chinese border to recon noiter the now famous petroglyphs. Since that time Dani has published a number of studies on this subject, most significantly the book Chilas— The City of Nanga Parvat (Dyamai), in 1983. Jettmar and his German compatriots have also expended great efforts to bring this material to the scholarly community and lay public, notably in the photo exhibit Ζwischen Gandhara und den Seidenstrasse-Felsbilder am Kaiakorum Highway, with a well-illustrated catalogue published in 1985 which, for the first time, presented excellent quality photographs of the rock pictures. Although the photos in the present work are adequate in most cases, they focus necessarily on the rock inscriptions, often showing only bits of the draw ings they were meant to accompany. For this reason it would be most helpful to have Dani's book handy, in spite of its often poorly repro duced photographs. A useful concordance may be found in )ettmar's volume. I would also recom mend a copy of the exhibition catalogue, since it has superior photographs and some drawings of the material. It is to Dr. Jettmar's credit that he was able to assemble such a fine group of paléographie spe cialists to study at first hand and contribute arti cles to this work. Gerard Fussman interprets the most important of the Kharosthi inscriptions, mainly a large group at Chilas II. Oskar von Hiniiber renders important Bràhmï inscriptions in two articles. Nicholas Sims-Williams gives a short summary of some of the Sogdian inscrip tions, mostly from Shatial I. An article on an important Chinese inscription of the Wei dynasty also appears under the authorship of the late Ma Yong. In addition, an article on styles and chron ology of Central Asian Brâhml script by Lore Sander is included, although this is mainly con cerned with manuscript calligraphy. Jettmar sets the stage in his introductory essay. Unlikely as it may seem, we may now be fairly certain that the ancient North-Indus/Karakorum trade route to the Tarim Basin followed approxi mately the same itinerary as the modern highway, in spite of the horrendous difficulties of the ter rain. Other routes of similar or even greater dif ficulties certainly existed, but this was most probably the main one. Caravaneers, Buddhist monks, foreign envoys, and even invading hordes threaded their way along the same precipices, crossed the same raging torrents, and braved blizzard and avalanche to save the many months required to travel to India via the longer Pamir route. Most of the travellers inscriptions were probably made at specific way stations or "seasonal waiting rooms," as Jettmar calls them, where those itinerant individuals were forced to wait for seasonal changes to bring about optimal road conditions. Sogdian merchants clustered near a bridge site close to Shatial which must have been a trading post beyond which they were not allowed to do business. Besides those in transit many other significant inscriptions and rock pictures were made by local residents, religious or secular dignitaries, and regional rulers.

Jettmar himself describes it as a first step in uncovering the history of this little-known region, now revealed as a major ancient artery of communication be tween the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. It is sincerely to be hoped that Western scholars and their Pakistani counterparts will continue to reveal the secrets of this fascinating area. Martha L. Carter</page></plain_text>
