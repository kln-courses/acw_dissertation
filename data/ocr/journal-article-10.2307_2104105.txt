<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE THEORY OF INDUCTION I. INDUCTION AND PROBABILITY Induction serves three purposes. It discovers hypotheses, it offers evi- dential support for generalities, and it tells us something about the future. There are no doubt others; but we shall be concerned chiefly with these. The search for evidence involves a peculiar method in the choosing of axioms, while formal guesses about the future rely upon the estimation of chances. Carnap's excellent book is one of the most suggestive that has yet appeared on the topic. However, he is concerned with its logical aspects. Here we shall be occupied chiefly with aspects considered inherent; we shall deal with subtopics, such as the phenomenology of induction or the theory of appli- cations, only as they contribute to the viewpoint of ontology. We shall not impose an ontological interpretation upon induction but seek the ontology implicit in inductive procedures. There is a further difference. Carnap distinguishes logical from empirical probability. The understanding in this article is that induction proper is to be distinguished from the two meanings of probability, on grounds which will presently be introduced. Induction, we shall assume, is the generic name covering three groups of operations: induction proper, confirmation, and frequency. All three, however, involve both the logical and the empirical orders to some extent. Some comparisons between induction and probability may be helpful. In induction we start with the data, which suggest to us the possibility of their being typical, and rise to a level of logical generality independent of the data. These cats are fair samples of all cats; These cats are black; Therefore maybe all cats are black. In probability we start with the logical generality of a hypothesis and descend to the level of particularity where testing against the relevant data is possible. For instance, Adult males smoked on an average of 18.5 cigarettes per day in 1937 in the U. S.; John Q. Wilkins is an adult male; Therefore the chances are that he smoked 18.5 cigarettes per day in 1937. Here we have a wide range of variation of procedures, all of which, however, reveal a similar set of elements. The hypothesis to be tested may be implicit in the grouping of the data, as in the graphing of masses of data to discover the common tendency in a frequency distribution. Or the hypothesis may 332</page><page sequence="2">ON THE THEORY OF INDUCTION 333 be candidly stated, as in the case of a laboratory experiment designed to trap the data. It is interesting to note from these two examples that probability formu- lations in some respects are closer to deduction than is logical induction. This is at first glance surprising, until we remember that probability and deduction move in the same direction: what is missing in the case of prob- ability is the necessity which is present in deduction. Probability is an approach to deduction, a statistical percentage of the conclusion the remainder of which is what prevents it from being inevitable. A second contrast is in the number of data involved. Usually an induction is suggested by very few data, often as little as a single datum. Poincar6 once said that the hallmark of genius was the ability to make a little experi- ence go a very long way. A statistical probability, on the other hand, is characterized by its treatment of enormous quantities of data. A sufficiently large collection of instances has the capacity to rise to a non-particular generality often by sheer number. It has often been noticed, for instance, that a single dead man is a dreadful sight, whereas thousands of dead men on a battlefield are not, because the generality of the latter has robbed it of the individuality which the anthropomorphism of the former possessed. On the basis of time we can make a distinction between induction and probability. Induction does not refer to time, probability does. In induc- tion, we seek a timeless generality as a result of our investigation of data. Whether we find it or not, or whether what we find is what we think at first that we have found, is another question. In probability we seek to make predictions on the basis of a hypothesis from the data. Gambling, the attempt to edge into the future just a little, to move ahead temporally, is in fact what started the whole mathematical science of statistical probabil- ity. Some events collected from the past or present, considered logically together, suggest what others of a similar nature yet to occur might be. Another point of contrast between induction and probability is that induction is not self-corrective, whereas probability is. You cannot improve your induction by making it over again, whereas repeated probability calculations tend to improve. You cannot arrive at greater generality by having more flashes of insight from the same data, as in induction; but you can improve your estimate of the degree of correctness of a hypothesis by improving your sampling of data, as in probability. A final point of contrast is that induction discovers for us a new proposi- tion as a hypothesis to be tested. Probability tests the degree of confirma- tion in support of the new hypothesis. Viewed in this way, induction and probability are complemental, two steps in the same process. As in most cases connected with scientific procedures, however, either step may occur separately, and to this extent they are independent.</page><page sequence="3">334 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH We have been discussing differences between induction and probability. It may be well to point out some significant similarities. Both induction and probability are concerned with the relation between data and hypothesis. Both are attempts to weave the two orders together by increasing the number of factual instances and specifying the logical generality until the one approaches the other. Neither induction nor probability can be worked properly without an equal regard for both. The evidence to the contrary usually consists in a misunderstanding of what is implied in the procedure. It is well known that we can freely abandon the hypothesis but never the data. There is no caution to "save the hypothesis"; on the contrary, it is considered well to have at hand a number of hypotheses, so that if one fails to do the job it can be abandoned in favor of some other. But the reason why we hold onto the data when we "save the phenomena" is because the probability of error is smaller in this case than in the choice of generality contained in hypoth- eses. The greater the claim, the larger the chance for error. This and this alone is the reason, and not that reality resides more in the one place than in the other. Data and hypotheses are equally real. II. LOGICAL INDUCTION; EMPIRICAL PROBABILITY Although probability as well as induction involves the logical and the empirical orders, induction leans toward the logical and probability toward the empirical. We see the logical tendency of induction at work in its relation to deduc- tion. Induction presupposes a deductive situation. If we can conceive of the truth about reality as a kind of lattice structure, increasing in generality from bottom to top, then induction and deduction are merely different directions in the structure. Induction leaps up the logical structure to choose a rung from which a painfully slow descent is made, each step of which is necessary. You will notice that deduction deals with classes only. Its individuals are classes which are themselves the members of classes. Induc- tion alone has regard for individuals which are not treated at first as also classes, though it does seek to find the classes of such individuals. In induction, we seek to find from the observed facts the laws under which the facts come. If a is a member of the class K, and a has the property y, then perhaps all members of the class K have the property y. For instance, This fruit has a green color; This fruit tastes bitter; Perhaps all green fruit is bitter. This is typical induction. The caution, "perhaps," in the conclusion is not to be interpreted in the sense of some, in which case the syllogism would be</page><page sequence="4">ON THE THEORY OF INDUCTION 335 deductively valid, but in the sense of all or not-all. The conclusion of the induction is intended to be read Perhaps all (but if not, then not-all) green fruit is bitter. Induction is logical in that it is concerned with classes and their members, and with certain relations which hold between them. All other kinds of induction are subdivisions of this type. There are predictions, for instance, and definite descriptions. We shall not examine these to show their subordination, but instead look at some of the implications of this view of induction. There is an implied assumption in this procedure to the effect that no facts are random facts. Moreover, the laws by anticipation are not held to be random, either; we expect that they will fit into a system of laws. Thus the covering hypoth- eses of induction all concern a deductive structure present even if hidden. Induction is merely our way of looking at the matter, of getting into the problem of discovering the extent of the deductive structure. The most extreme case of induction, that kind which would seem to hold deduction to a minimum, is contained in the business of getting from one particular fact to another. Here expectation, which more fittingly concerns probability, is involved. Let us elaborate Russell's example of Pavlov's conditioned reflex. We condition a dog to salivate when a bell is rung by ringing the bell every time he is fed and then ringing it again without the food. Two events connected in the past are expected to be connected in the future. But this step can only be accomplished by calling in a low-grade generality. If A is connected with B in the past, then similar A's will be connected with similar B's in the future. There must be some logical connection between A and B which makes them independent of events. That this is false in the instance of the bell and the food is soon discovered even by the dog, in whom the association fades if the bell is rung too often without feeding until he fails to salivate. How valid is induction? The question occurs logically at this point in the exposition. If we mean by validity logical necessity, as we do in the case of deduction, why then the only possible answer is that induction is invalid. But there are degrees. A false deduction is what we mean ordinarily by an invalid one: something which does not entail something else in the way in which we have come to expect that it should. Tautology is the ideal of entailment, contradiction its absolute denial. These limits of tautology and contradiction (for we have learned to understand that nontrivial tautolo- gies, at least, are analytic and tell us more than about the continuity of unity) afford the framework to contain the expansion of probabilities. The validity of an induction is indifferent to the number of instances which suggested it. The dream of how things ought to be or of how they are is</page><page sequence="5">336 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH contained in a sweep of inclusiveness which can be sampled empirically but never surveyed. We cannot talk, then, about the validity of induction except we mean its pinpointed success in disclosing premises for deduction. Induction is involved in the choosing of rules or of formulas which it is hoped will prove appropriate. Induction is successful a sufficient number of times to afford the times when it is unsuccessful. The question of the validity of induction is statistical, and can be settled only on the basis of economy. But it can only be either successful or unsuccessful. Validity is limited to deductive entailment-necessity-and in connection with induction must refer to the deductive background that every induction presupposes. It is safe to say, then, that induction is primarily logical. It begins by seeking the generality which is imbedded in particular facts, but it leaves them very quickly for the realm of logic. It is a curious fact that particulars do not suggest percentages but only universals. If you begin with the premises derived from observation This fruit has a green color; This fruit tastes bitter; you never conclude that Perhaps 88.9 per cent of all green fruit is bitter but only Perhaps all green fruit is bitter. You may be entirely wrong, or you may be 11.1 per cent wrong; still, the premises suggest a universal. Induction is at base logical, and in its uni- versality ontological, in the sense that the ontological is clearly involved in the weaving together of universal and fact. We have noted that induction is primarily logical, although also empir- ical. Now we shall look at the condition of probability, which is primarily empirical, although also logical. In probability, we seek to find from generalizations based on facts the knowledge of other facts. If a is a member of the class K, and a has the property y, then if b is a member of K, b will have the property y. This is typical probability. It can of course be expanded, and there are many varieties. Take for instance, All ripe fruit is digestible; These objects are ripe fruit; Therefore these objects will be digestible. This is quite different from Two thirds of these chairs are hard; These chairs are from this building;</page><page sequence="6">ON THE THEORY OF INDUCTION 337 The chances are two thirds that the next chair from this building will be hard. The first is concerned with the degree of confirmation of a hypothesis, the second estimates relative frequency. Neither, it is obvious, discovers a hypothesis, and so we cannot classify them as inductions. They are prob- ability arguments. That is to say, they belong to that species of induction which is called probability because the emphasis is upon the operation of examining empirical particulars. Moreover, they are further subdivided into degree of confirmation types and relative frequency types, depending on whether we are seeking to confirm a hypothesis, or to calculate risks. A last point about the empirical nature of probability, as contrasted with the logical leanings of induction, emerges from an examination of their difference in type of concern for generality. Induction seeks the greatest degree of generality: universality. Probability is content with a precise but lesser degree of generality. There is a reason. Universality may be infinite, generality is finite. The distinction is brought about by the difference in classes dealt with: the infinite applies only to classes of relations and not to classes of things, that is, it does not apply to classes whose members are actual individuals. The natural numbers are infinite, we can assert this on the basis of Peano's postulates; but on what basis could we assert that the class of chairs is? We must bear in mind at this point that we could not assert that the chairs are not, either, though there is a strong predisposition in that direction. Not to be able to assert infinity does not mean to be able to deny it. For the purposes of ontological as well as logical and empirical estimations, we assume that we are dealing with a logical world which is in some respects infinite, and a factual world which is finite. The leading concern of probability, then, is factual. It starts from general- ities but employs them only to learn something about the nature of partic- ular facts. Its purposes are mundane and practical, and candidly so. Like induction, it employs both logical and empirical factors, but its aim is very clear and very different. So far as it can it argues from fact to fact; it seeks to find from the properties of this thing and that event what other things and events will be like when found or when they occur. It is an instrument of prediction and control, in contrast to induction, which is an instrument of discovery. III. PHENOMENOLOGICAL BEARINGS We have been discussing the logical content of induction and the empir- ical content of its leading subdivision, probability. Operationally we do not wish to set the logical apart from the empirical; the logical is distinct from the empirical in this connection not so much in being non-empirical as in having equal application to all the areas of empiricism. For our knowledge</page><page sequence="7">338 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH of logic is derived from the data of our sense experience. Contradiction could have been an abstraction from conflict, deduction a derivative of consequences (for, in answer to Hume, we do at least think that we see one event follow on another). Similarly, induction may have arisen from anal- ogy, to which it is, in some respect, very close (Keynes); and analogy, in turn, may have come from the perception of similarity and difference. Any current attempt to understand the nature of induction involves a central unsolved problem. The phenomenological aspect of induction involves a fast association of ideas or images. How this takes place, how it can be taught to happen, lies at the present moment entirely beyond our powers of understanding. Induction, under the psychological name of intui- tion, is an act of unconscious rationality, part of the instinctive mental life. To some extent it is possible to get control of this intuitive process, to make it conscious. In this form, it is what Pierce called "ideal experimenta- tion." We imagine how things could be other than they are, and then ob- serve the products of imagination in order to compare them with things as they are. In terms of this comparison, we are ready to set about bringing things nearer to what we have concluded they ought to be, or, more rarely, to abandon the products of the imagination in favor of things as they are. The extent to which we need imagination to discover things just as they are has been very surprising and often confusing. The sudden perception of similarity and differences among actual things and events requires effort. It has often been pointed out that "nature loves to hide," and the key to the understanding of natural events has often been discovered by imagining what it might be and then searching-successfully-for it. This would be strange indeed were the world filled with random phenomena. But where there are no entirely unique facts, and where all are examples of some general principles, this could easily be the case. Such propositions often do have to be supposed. The human imagination works at its highest only in two contexts: in the choice of axioms, as in the case of science, mathematics and logic; and in the discovery of works of art. So far, there seems to be little agreement about the products of the imagination except in the former case; for the purposes of this argument, at any rate, we shall leave art out of it. The evidence of things unseen, then, is not faith but deductions from axiom-sets. We com- mit an act of faith when we choose the axioms, and this must be done by induction. The greater part of this discussion has been devoted to showing that like all other mental processes the phenomenology of induction depends upon the logic of induction and not the reverse. The phenomenology of induction presents a problem because we understand it less than we do other mental</page><page sequence="8">ON THE THEORY OF INDUCTION 339 processes which reflect logical relations. We have said nothing about the phenomenology of probability, where the situation is clearer. In probability, we are concerned with the data of experience and not with the experience. Hence we are dealing with relative frequency, as so often has been asserted, and not with credibility. Degree of confirmation is a statistical relation, not a measure of belief. A hypothesis which is, let us say, seventy-five per cent confirmed, compels belief exactly to that degree. So far as truth is concerned, belief may wander where it will; but the facts are the same. IV. PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC INDUCTION There is a sense in which the description of the empirical sciences as inductive is a misnomer. It was coined to distinguish the experimental sciences from the purely speculative ones, such as mathematics. Now it is well known that a fully developed science employs both induction and deduction. In the meaning of the terms adopted here, science must be said to employ all three: induction, probability, and deduction. There is nothing that has been said, so far as we have gone in this paper, that would not apply in some instances of laboratory and desk procedures. It is not our intention to offer a manual of scientific method in order to show the various applications of induction and probability to the sciences. The plan is merely to point out certain details in connection with this type of practice. Scientific procedures properly begin with the discovery of hypotheses. This, as we have noted, is inductive, and it happens very quickly, so quickly that the event is hardly noticed. The time is taken up by tests involving probabilities of one sort or another. Let us assume that an induction has been made from some perception by an investigator who has a hunch that the possession of the property y by several x's may be significant. He there- fore sets up as a hypothesis to be examined the proposition, All x's have the property y. Let us now further assume that to test x's for their y-ness is not so easy as it sounds; it may for instance require the devising of some ingenious laboratory equipment to trap the requisite data into yielding a positive or negative answer. The investigator, we shall say, performs the experiment; what has he accomplished? We can sum up the logic of the relation as follows: If the hypothesis that all x's have the property y is true, then we should be able somehow to observe the y-ness of any x's selected at random; Experiments enable us to observe the y-ness of these x's; To this extent, then, the hypothesis (that all x's have the property y) is supported. The process can be repeated over and over, often gaining decimal points with each successive operation. This is standard procedure; but there are</page><page sequence="9">340 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH other problems, problems which we cannot yet even outline. Let us con- sider the problem of axiom-sets, for instance. There appear to be three kinds of induction in mathematics: (i) systemic induction, (ii) induction to systematize known material, and (iii) induction to the proofs of theorems. (i) The task of discovering axiom-sets in mathematics is a kind of major induction-systemic induction, we have named it. Nothing worth men- tioning here is known about how this is accomplished. (ii) This may be logical or empirical. Peano's choice of postulates for whole numbers is an example of the logical. It is the empirical which will chiefly occupy us. Let us suppose that we meet the investigator when he is equipped with a number of empirical propositions and is faced with the abstract structures presented to him by mathematics. He wishes to reduce his empirical knowledge to mathematical form. He is working here with definite empirical material and rigorous mathematical structure, yet there is an interstice open to induction. For intuition enters with the necessity for choosing among the empirical propositions just those which shall best serve as axioms. In this fashion we seek to combine the constructive method employed by empiricism with the postulational method of logic and mathe- matics. We have before us, then, the problem of finding the relation between probability and the choosing of axiom-sets. This turned out to be largely one of meshing empirical material into a mathematical system, but our inquiry may have to begin further back in the process. For once we have collected the data, we are confronted with the problem of interpretation. A ghosted hypothesis guided the collection of the data yet frequently proves inadequate to cover it. Interpretation of the data is governed by the principle of economy: it must fit the least proposition required-the one next above and not some one way above. Perhaps these are the facts which truly underlie both induction by simple enumeration and the fallacy of inverse probability. (iii) Induction to the proofs of theorems is induction working within a restricted range. V. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS It has been argued, correctly, that deduction is always necessary and induction always accidental. It is perfectly true that induction is a part and not the whole, and that it is the complementary of deduction. Induction has a better chance when it takes off from particular facts, the inductive fallacy was bred by the more dangerous procedure of making inductions from generals to generals. For induction can always be a fallacious form of reasoning in any case. The chief point in its favor is that only a form of</page><page sequence="10">ON THE THEORY OF INDUCTION 341 argument capable of committing great error is also likely to be one capable of arriving at great truth. Morris Cohen was right when he showed that discoveries are often deductively made, yet this is the exception and not the rule. Induction accounts for most of the important discoveries. The conviction of valid reasoning stems from what happens after the axioms have been chosen, but who chose the axioms? A valid argument is no better than its axiom-set, no better than the basis given to it by induction. In this connection it is a serious mistake to assume that the feelings are irrational. Only those feelings which lead directly to falsity are. In many cases, however, they have led to truth, and these are the instances we have to explain. Given the immensely disproportionate number of truths to falsehoods (the order is one to infinity), the rationality of most feelings has to be taken for granted, else they would never have led us to any truth at all. But if feelings have been held irrational, the inverse is also often true: disreputable theories are so often called upon to justify useful procedures. The heavy Freudian machinery behind the technique of psychoanalysis is a good example. It seems to the beneficiaries as though the theory has been proved by the success of the practice. The inductive procedures, including probability, were made imperative by the fact that events move too fast for truth. "Here today and gone tomorrow" holds for every episode, for every particular thing. Feelings as well as facts, values as well as vices, the pain and the pleasure, the qualities that perhaps we most wanted to hang onto, soon pass into history. We can catch them only in the addition, and fix them all in some statistical average where they lose their identity in submitting to the meaning of the whole trend. In this way, perhaps, probability does not leap into truth, as induc- tion does, but minutely crawls toward it. This is a method which has its own virtues. The business of the day may have to be beguiled, for practical men of action will never think that you have done well in speaking of the truth unless it is so abstract that they are wholly unable to relate it to immediate affairs. Has it sufficiently occurred to us that they may be partly right? We may have to confine our absolutes to the inflexibility of the search for them. All past thinking has been in terms of alternative absolutes: we were always informed that if this proposition were absolutely wrong, it is only because that one was absolutely right. But the success of empirical science has been dominated by the idea of successive approximations, by tentative asser- tions, by asymptotes. The dictionary consists chiefly of universals; could we perhaps learn to think in terms of generalities, of most rather than all, of some rather than any? Instead of what is known, we might substitute what is put forward. The principle of uncertainty could save us from the cataclysms into which the clash of absolutes has led us. If we have the</page><page sequence="11">342 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH courage to be wrong, we may find the imagination to be right. Life may become tolerant as it is made more tentative; and the broad applications of induction and probability in this way come into their own. JAMES K. FEIBLEMAN. TULANE UNIVERSITY. EXTRACTO La inducci6n cumple tres prop6sitos: descubre hip6tesis, ofrece datos en apoyo de afirmaciones generates y nos dice algo relativo al futuro. Por consiguiente, efectua estas tres operaciones: la inducci6n propiamente dicha, la confirmaci6n y la frecuencia. La inducci6n es l6gica, la probabi- lidad es empirica. La fenomenologfa de la inducci6n depende de la l6gica de la inducci6n, y no inversamente. La probabilidad depende de los datos, y no de la experiencia; por ello concierne a la frecuencia relativa, y no a la verosimilitud. En ciencia, el descubrimiento de hip6tesis es inductive. E1 nombre que debiera darse al descubrimiento de un repertorio de axio- mas es el de inducci6n sistematica. La intuici6n elige las proposiciones empiricas que mejor hayan de servir como axiomas al investigador. Tan s6lo una argumentaci6n capaz de ser muy err6nea es susceptible de lle- varnos a una gran verdad. Una argumentaci6n valida no vale mas, en fin de cuentas, que el sistema axiomatico de donde procede. No todos los sentimientos son irracionales; los que conduzcan a la verdad son racio- nales. El principio de indeterminaci6n, al producir una serie de aproxi- maciones sucesivas de tanteo, pudiera habernos salvado del cataclismo a que nos conduce el choque de los absolutes.</page></plain_text>
