Rivers of Change: Trailing the Waterways of Lewis and Clark is Tom Mullen's account of his five-month-long journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to the mouth of the Columbia River at Astoria, Oregon. Mullen's book is large part quirky travelogue, small-part history, and even smaller-part personal philosophy. Its bulk contains Mullen's observations while traveling along the banks of the Missouri River from St. Charles, Missouri, to Three Forks, Montana. As a matter of fact, approximately two hundred and fifty of the book's three hundred and eigh teen pages are devoted to the Missouri River's past, present, and tentative future. The other rivers of Lewis and Clark, the Yellowstone, Columbia, and Snake, receive far less atten tion. Granted, Lewis and Clark spent more time along the Missouri than any other river in the Northwest. Mullen, however, spends no time along the Snake and provides only cursory coverage of the Yellowstone and Columbia. Consequently, Rivers of Change is less a book about the waterways of Lewis and Clark than about the Missouri River. Mullen's enthusiasm, even fanaticism, for the Mighty Mo is palpable throughout the text. He writes so little about the Yellowstone and Columbia that one gets the sense that the BOOK REVIEWS 269 climax of the book and Mullen's trip had been reached at the Three Forks. From there until the end of both journey and book, it is a hard, tedious, slog—an attempt to reach the finish line, irrespective of geographical discovery or philosophical insight. The author's descriptions of the contem porary Lower Missouri are the strong point of the book, enabling the reader to visualize the deep, channelized, virtually dead ditch the Missouri River has become south and east of Sioux City, Iowa. Mullen also properly depicts the upstream dams and reservoirs, particularly the utilitarian, militaristic appearances of the dams. He does a good job of explaining the controversies over the Missouri's management, detailing the dispute among barge navigation advocates who seek the status quo antebellum, upper basin recreational interests who want more water stored behind the big six dams, and lower basin organizations who want a spring flood and lower summer flows. Mullen met and interviewed scores of eccentric, wild people, as odd and unpredict able as the rivers themselves, while traversing the Missouri, Yellowstone, and Columbia, and their stories enhance the text. There's Marlin Roth, who refused to sell his Missouri Valley property at a handsome profit so he can give it away to become a state park. There's Dan Ryan, who built a fifteen-hundred-dollar home out of straw bales, its interior resembling a carnival fun house, with distorted angles and dishev eled trimming. In the Columbia Basin, Mullen finds a man named Rod at a salmon fish hatch ery who seems to suffer from social phobias and believes in conspiracy theories. Mullen inadvertently makes it plain that in this age of coerced conformity, human diversity and the American penchant for unrestrained thought and alternative ways of life still exist in the hinterlands of the United States. Jumping from place to place, topic to topic so quickly, Mullen offers little depth. It is difficult to get a feel, a sense, a visualization of some of the areas he visits in the Upper Missouri, Yellowstone, and Columbia basins. Instead, this reader is left with the impression</page><page sequence="2">270 GREAT PLAINS QUARTERLY, FALL 2005 that Mullen moved through these regions, and interacted with people, with such haste that he could not develop deeper insights into their meaning. Moreover, I found Mullen's repeated anthropomorphic invocations of "Six Pac," his pickup truck and camper, in the text and pho tographs distracting and annoying. Mullen's primary thesis, that rivers change, is self-evident. There is nothing new in that. He makes the corollary statement that humans need to adjust to change. Well, yes, that is obvious too. Humans must adapt to survive. Ultimately, Rivers of Change lacks punch. Mullen states (this is one of the lessons he learned while on the rivers of the West) that we must be reasoned, patient, non-blaming, willing to compromise, and ready to rely on local knowledge to solve river management problems. Once more, he draws obvious and irrefutable conclusions. Reason and patience are surely commendable virtues, but both have contributed to the Missouri's present, dismal ecological condition. Patience is beneficial to the privileged and entrenched interests in the West, such as the Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation. Along the Missouri, patience has run out—it evaporated long ago. It is time for action, time for authors like Mullen to take a reasoned, determined stand on the issues. Anecdotes will not suffice.
