TOYNBEE JOHN WENDON* It is subjectivity that Christianity is concerned with, and it is only in sub- jectivity that its truth exists, if it exists at all; objectively Christianity has absolutely no existence. If its truth happens to be in only a single subject, it exists in him alone; and there is greater Christian joy in heaven over this one individual than over universal history.-KIERIKEGAARD.' WE ARE bound in these times to hear increasingly about the need for Christianity to save civilization. For this, the immediate im- pulse stems from the current ideological struggle with communism, a creed whose power derives ultimately from its asser- tion to be the science of all human his- tory. This metaphysical claim to control the destiny of man heightens the import of Christianity, for it is the only fully articulated body of convictions capable of countering historical materialism and its militancy. But even if communism did not exist or make such claims, a "re- turn" to Christianity would still be a very frequent counsel. There is abroad a general sense that civilization has arrived at a stage where it fails to support itself, an attitude closely akin to what has re- cently been so well termed "the terror of history."2 Not decadence but rather an alarming excess or hypertrophy of ener- gies has created a mood of impotence and loss of faith in the conditions of historical existence. Here it is a matter of the fear of losing control. But to this also Chris- tianity is held to have an "answer," and it is thus proffered a scepter of sover- eignty which a disillusioned, secular era would relinquish. It can only be Chris- tian piety which can establish a connec- tion between human history, as a process incomplete in itself, and a transcending, saving, fulfilling God. What are the implications? At this time, when the collective, political world is very close to the stark issue of survival and when political conflicts evidently fail to resolve themselves politically, the temptation is great to reconsider such a struggle in transcendental terms. But the more forcibly does the question arise what the result must be if (say) the West were committed to the effort of making of Christian faith a weapon to achieve a historical success against communism, or even to "save" civilization itself. The Christian viewpoint would be reduced to an ideology and, like a modern version of Mohammedanism, deployed as the moral energy of a secular, imperialist enter- * John Wendon was educated at Cambridge University.

Sacrificed also would be any pre- tense to a Christian knowledge of histori- cal being, for the laws of God would ob- viously subserve motives of mere sur- vival. Religion and ideologies are irrecon- cilables. If, nevertheless, religion is al- lowed so to degenerate as to permit itself to be treated as an ideology--which is what most of the social sciences do-the claim is relinquished that religion is the domain of ultimate truth. Instead, re- ligion becomes that which is ascribed to it: a pretext (among some others) where- by the forces of history are said to ad- vance their cause. The one remaining ab- solute then, unchallenged and unchal- lengeable, is history itself, taken as a di- mension embodying both future and past and as a process of causal necessity, which is blind to all but its own principle of perpetuation. And yet, by this same token of perpetuation, history would need to demand that there be ideological pretexts, that is, religions used for ul- terior purposes. For, apparently, men do not find in the consciousness of history's necessities sufficient motivation for their "co-operation." History needs to per- suade its victims, and thus proto-histori- cal myths are created which, in the ab- sence of genuine religious knowledge, do service under a mask of freedom for what is in fact naked necessity. The cunning of history usurps the wisdom of God. The role of history, as a dimension in human judgment, has steadily grown since the eighteenth century, when the ideal of history as the wider vision of man, transcending the merely parochial and the merely egotistical, first gave to the doctrines of Enlightenment literati their revolutionary impetus. The argu- ment ran in something like the following manner: If man can predict, almost with certainty, those appearances of which he understands the laws; if, even when these laws are unknown to him, experience of the past enables him to foresee with considerable probability, future appearances; why should we suppose it chi- merical to delineate with some degree of truth the picture of the future destiny of mankind from the results of its history? The only foun- dation of faith in the natural sciences is the principle, that the general laws, known or un- known, which regulate the phenomena of the universe, are regular and constant; and why should this principle applicable to other opera- tions of nature be less true when applied to the development of the intellectual and moral faculties of man? We shall find the strongest reasons to be- lieve, from past experience, from observation of the progress which the sciences and civilisa- tion have hitherto made, and from the analysis of the march of the human understanding and the development of its faculties, that nature has fixed no limits to our hopes. The advantages that must result from the state of improvement ... can have no limit but the absolute perfection of the human species. The words are those of Condorcet, from his Progress of the Human Mind, written in 1793.3 They were the testa- ment of their time--of the Enlighten- ment as it issued in the French Revolu- tion. Christianity was finally "disestab- lished" both intellectually and psycho- logically, and in place of its doctrines concerning human limitation and origi- nal sin stood a belief in the perfectibility of man and the progress of human his- tory. But even as these words were written, their author was being terrorized into suicide, victim of the very revolution of which he himself was a leader. The fate of his religion of progress was to be not dissimilar. The years between 1789 and 1815 proved to be a full-dress rehearsal of modern history, and by 1815, with the smoke of a burned-out revolution and of the Napoleonic venture hanging, like a</page><page sequence="3">CHRISTIANITY, HISTORY, AND MR. TOYNBEE 141 pall, over a shocked and disturbed Eu- rope, it was evident that Europe, for all its energy, industry, and science, was be- reft of its causes and credos. Mme de Stall, a woman distinguished for her journalistic intuitions, wrote the follow- ing words at the time, clearly witnessing the suddenly apparent emptiness in his- torical inspiration: I do not know exactly what we must believe, but I believe that we must believe! ... The human spirit lives by its beliefs. Acquire faith through Christianity, or through German philosophy, or merely through enthusiasm, but believe in something. Such counsel, at times of historical dis- ruption, is relevant. Faith is the condi- tion of significant existence. And, as the novels of Stendhal amply testify, the post-Napoleonic age was full of disen- chantment and ennui. But how could an authentic choice be made? How could a faith be adopted for the sake of a faith? Spiritual hunger is not assuaged by random selection of some ideality, par- ticularly when that ideality is intended to promote an ulterior purpose. For Mme de Sta6l it was, in the final analysis, his- tory which demanded that men continue to believe-note the intransitive tend- ency in her use of the term "believe"- lest history become insupportable. And, at the same time, history was assumed to be by definition essentially indifferent to the nature and the content of belief. At the least, this was to mean a conflict in loyalty. From the beginning, it was a struggle weighted in favor of history, and Mme de Stall's faiths were soon transformed into history's subsidiary functions. The intel- lectual, at any rate, could now only be- lieve in history itself. Postrevolutionary disappointments proved to be a tem- porary setback for the idealization of his- tory (historicism). Views like those of Condorcet, in their excess of optimism, needed not to be abandoned but to be transformed from an unqualified faith in progress into a yet more intense and di- rect identification with history, disre- garding its secondary effects in happiness and enlightenment or in failure and dis- aster. The unilinear line of progress needed only to be discarded for a differ- ent calculus: a dialectic, inherent as a will in the spirit of history itself. Accord- ingly, the r6volution manqu6 should not destroy man's faith in history; rather, it should lead to the recognition that the claims of history are absolute. To men of Condorcet's persuasion and to the eight- eenth century generally, such a submis- sion to history would still have been con- tingent on its beneficence. But this dis- crimination the nineteenth century dis- carded, persuaded that history took its course beyond the reach of temporary categories of good and evil. The revolu- tion so clearly demonstrated violence and disruption to be a normative part of its chronicle (and of a kind that could not be conveniently debited, in the manner of the Enlightenment, to the account of past ignorance or of Christian teaching or of any other remediable agency) that a more realistic view of history was im- perative, i.e., a more scientific analysis of its processes, applied to the society of men, needed to be discovered. Condor- cet's ecstatic worldliness passed into the use of more ruthlessly subtle minds. (Even Christianity was then rehabili- tated-as a force of history.) The gallery of names that stretches from Condorcet,4 through Hegel, Comte,5 and Marx, to the scientific humanists and scientific mate- rialists of today need not here concern us, except to notice that all share the same premise of a science of man as an applied science of history:</page><page sequence="4">142 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION If the world is knowable and our knowledge of the development of Nature is authentic knowledge, having the validity of objective truth, it follows that social life, the development of society, is also knowable, and that the data of science regarding the laws of development of society are authentic data having the validity of objective truths. The history of society ceases to be an ag- glomeration of "accident," and becomes the history of the development of society according to regular laws, and the study of the history of society becomes a science. These words, so surprisingly close to Condorcet, have as their author Stalin;6 and his conclusion is the following: Hence the practical activity of the party of the proletariat must not be based on the good wishes of "outstanding individuals," not on the dictates of "reason, universal morals" etc. but on the laws of development of society and on the study of these laws. Above all, this means that history is in- vested with infallibility-for attributed to it are not only events but also their validation. Our era had its beginning in that habit of thought which, from the outset of the nineteenth century, accus- tomed men to historicize all values. In search of human significance, they recon- ciled themselves to following history down all its winding, devious roads and accepted its necessity in the hope that they would ultimately arrive at that recessive freedom and calm promised to those who could execute as a mandatory act the cruelties of history. In this fash- ion, communism has become the natural heir to all the metaphysics of history, and, appropriately, it has learned to be- have as though it wielded "the sword of history" (Bukharin), so transforming ancient Greek fatality into a murderous irony of consciousness. The old god of time, Chronos, once more is sovereign, but now he devours his children in the name of the permanent revolutions of history. There is no room left today for those who, like Mme de Stall, perhaps, pre- ferred to see in revolution only a means to an end. Nor does their hope for "some" order of belief seem today more than a kind of agnostic fortitude or nos- talgia, typical of the altruistic liberal. Moreover, this, too, would play into the hands of history's apotheosis, for it abnegates the decision concerning the truth of beliefs in favor of whatever his- tory might demand or declare, by decree of success, to be valid. The subordination of belief to history makes belief itself in- supportable, while a belief in history ex- poses itself as a fatal solipsism: a tribal cult of "corporate self-worship" (Toyn- bee). Moreover, there comes into being a peculiar dependence on those who would tell us what history is. The dogmas of a few professors become the hinge of man's destiny. Therein lies the dilemma of the historicizing mentality, and it becomes embarrassing to discover that it owes its origins to Christianity. (It was Dostoev- ski who first argued that the secular cul- ture of the West had arisen because of, not despite, the Christian church.) For Christianity was first in proclaiming a historical dispensation and in giving his- tory its meaning. Nevertheless, we can- not consider reconciling a transcendental faith with a belief in history sui generis. Consequently the question we are ask- ing-what occurs when this Christian teaching, on which our contemporary philosophies of history are in many ways modeled, is in turn reduced in status to a temporal product of history and, simul- taneously, invoked as a salvation for his- tory? What happens, in short, when the relationship of Christ and history is in- verted? If history rules the world, then the world is ruled by sophism: "History never metes out justice, but always justi-</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTIANITY, HISTORY, AND MR. TOYNBEE 143 fies" (Croce). It seems absurd to attempt to elide the distinction between this and Christianity. Nevertheless another at- tempt to reconcile the irreconcilable is to be found in Arnold Toynbee's by now famous historical system, of which the final volumes were recently published. Toynbee, who believes history to be a province of the Kingdom of God, does not say that man's allegiance is to history rather than to God. On the contrary, by saying the reverse, it would appear to be his hope to have avoided the pitfalls of historicizing religious existence and be- liefs. Nor can it be said that Toynbee is unaware of the difficulties of making of Christianity the historical protagonist of history's own processive advance toward even higher expressions of its own(?) spirit. He writes: The terror which Russian communism was inspiring in Western hearts betrayed their awareness that the Western world was also favorable soil for the tares of totalitarianism. It looked as if, in a modern Westernising world, the war between God and Caesar might have to be waged once again; and it also looked as if, in that event, the morally honourable but spiritually perilous role of serving as the church militant would once again fall upon Christian- ity... [having] to pay the spiritual price that is exacted by militancy even in just wars waged for good causes.7 The spiritual price "exacted by mili- tancy" is indeed so high that Toynbee for one seems at times unresolved to pay it. In fact, he sustains indecision so long in the Study of History (ten volumes) that he leaves his reader with an unsatis- factory sense of an issue obscured: Why should higher religions perform un- precedented acts of self-sacrifice in order to bring into the world a new litter of outmoded civilisations? ... A church which stepped aside from its course and forebore to press forward towards its goal, in order to minister to a dying civilisation in its cradle, might save its life--if it did save it-by losing it for Christ's sake and the Gospel's-like the pilgrim in Tolstoy's tale who won God's grace when he earned his obtusely pharisaical travelling companion's contempt by fulfilling his pilgrimage in the spirit at the sacrifice of the letter.8 In the Study of History, Christianity-or, as Toynbee prefers it, religion in its high- est forms-is counterpoised incessantly to civilization, its material antithesis. But ultimately both merge simply as tributaries of that much sublimer stream, history itself. Toynbee's position is an Anglican ver- sion of Tolstoyan religion. But this is precisely the difficulty. The matter is more far-reaching than a personal in- capacity to make up his mind; Toynbee is unable to divest himself of the eight- eenth-century illuminati's assumption that there is no such thing as mystery. History, it would appear, composes itself simply in terms of the past (the known) and the future (the unknown), and the latter may be penetrated-at least, as though seeing through a glass, darkly- by the rational-empirical prognosis of the historically enlightened mind, which an- ticipates only what history itself will finally disclose. The fact that for Toyn- bee historical progress is conceived as spiritual progress toward what he calls a momentous "cumulative increase in the means of Grace" does not essentially al- ter this. Toynbee does not mean to prophesy; he means to predict. And what it amounts to is that he has made of God a metaphysically partial historian. Even his style reveals the predication: he writes of the present and of his own pre- diction of the future as though they were already past. Toynbee is intent upon rec- onciling all historical phenomena, includ- ing religious phenomena, within the larger historical system (his own), which, however, in his description is the equiva- lent of the historical process (as such). A personal justification for this is said to be</page><page sequence="6">144 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION a mystic experience which permitted the author to "see" in a vision the entire river of history flowing through him.' And, truly, the Study of History is a monumental effort which, as a major philosophy of history, valiantly tries to absorb the limitations of historical rela- tivity by repeatedly associating the par- ticular with the universal, the contingent with the inevitable, suffering and conflict with their sublimation, and, in general, the price with its reward-history with its fulfilment. Hence it is tempting to talk of Toynbee as the Plato among philosophers of history, the one who has achieved the great synthesis that has put an end to the career of all antecedent sophists of history. But theodicies are notoriously unstable, and Toynbee's theodicy of history is not an exception. The epistemological barrier is not so easily overcome, and the Study does not escape, for having a transcendental refer- ence (and interminable qualifications), the sophistry of the historicizing view- point. It may be impertinent to suggest it, but the Study's closest affinity is to Marx and not to the province of the Kingdom of God. The mark of philosophies of history is their speculative character-their seem- ing detachment-which permits the hy- postatizing of "open" empirical events into "closed" metaphysical systems. It is the product of a habit of thought which severs experience and relationships from the immediacy of historical situations in order to present them as recurring phe- nomena of a normative pattern-that of history as a process known in its totality. Toynbee himself describes this as "the personal tour de force which an historian has to attempt . . to correct, by imagi- nation, the bias inherent in the stand- point at which he has been placed . . in order to see and present the flux of hu- man life sub specie aeternitatis."'0 The re- sult, however, is only to reveal once again the monolithic ambitions of the human intellect. The Christian might feel that he must leave the architectonics of history to God; but the "student of History," Toynbee's own preferred name for himself, cannot forbear. In Toynbee's Study we are asked to find the religious model of the totality of history, a vast processing line of histori- cal revisions in which all known civiliza- tions and religions have been assigned a well-judged share of responsibility in the unceasing education of the human psy- che; the historical present and the future are expectantly embraced in the same omen of the whole-a projection of recur- rent enterprise which is expected ulti- mately to arrive at its telos, with a char- acter not unlike a modern, spiritualized version of Campanella's City of the Sun. This historical account is, significantly, intended to supply its own hermeneutic, through the literal use of metaphors of energy-of growth and decline, challenge and response, chrysalises, etc. By means of these, history is given the appearance of a relay race of survival by civilizations and religions. It is as though civilization were the track which the runners trav- erse, religion the air they breathe; and somewhere there is a goal where it is ex- pected that the last of the team will have become air-borne. The earlier volumes of Toynbee's Study were written in a some- what different spirit from those recently issued: the main concern then was to ex- posit the law of civilizations and the problem of their historical survival; in relation to this, religions were treated- consistently enough-as subordinate phenomena. Toynbee's position on this has been wholly reversed, and he now takes his stand on the view that "civilisa- tions might have to be envisaged or in-</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIANITY, HISTORY, AND MR. TOYNBEE 145 terpreted in terms not of their own des- tinies but of their effect on the history of religions": In this perspective, Christianity could be seen to be the climax of a continuous upward movement of spiritual progress which had not merely survived successive secular catastrophes but had drawn from them its cumulative in- spiration.... [And] if ... it was the historical function of civilisations to serve, by their downfalls, as stepping stones for a progressive process of the revelation of always deeper re- ligious insight, then the societies of the species called civilisations would have fulfilled their function when once they had brought mature higher religions to birth: and on this showing, a Western post-Christian secular civilisation [the present] might at best be a superfluous repetition of pre-Christian Hellenic Civilisa- tion.... The one conceivable historical justi- fication for its otherwise inauspicious existence would be the possible future service that it might inadvertently perform for Christianity and her three living sister religions [Mahayana, Hindu, and Islam] by providing them with a mundane meeting ground on a literally world- wide range, by bringing home to them the unity of their own ultimate values and beliefs. It may seem flattering to have re- ligion, and Christianity, given so promi- nent a role in the unfolding of history. It may also, however, not be at all relevant to religion, to Christianity especially, to be put in this position. In any case it is difficult to see how Toynbee created more than rather damaging ambiguities by his midstream change of civilized for religious horses. It must be that he be- lieves that, by making secular civiliza- tions subservient to the progress-and ultimate elevation-of transcendental religion, he has managed to circumvent the historicist's usual dilemma. He may see it as a kind of built-in escape mecha- nism for the system whereby in an ulti- mate time the process can suspend itself under license of religious accomplish- ment. But in the end the inversion of the pattern is unconvincing and abstract, and the character of Toynbee's thought is not essentially affected by it. What is affected, however, is Christianity. In fact, the "species of society called civili- sation" is not so much supplanted by re- ligion in Toynbee's system as amalga- mated in it, a step which Toynbee de- scribes as its transfiguration." Toynbee, in his predicting role, expects Christian- ity to have brought about "an immeas- urable improvement in the conditions of human social life on Earth"; and one cannot help realizing that once more Christianity is validated, not in itself as truth but in history and even by history, as the most powerful protagonist in the drama for historical perpetuation. In this connection it is very revealing that Toynbee finds it impossible per- sonally to accept a major portion of Christian doctrines, especially that of the uniqueness of the Incarnation. What he sees to be the Christianity of the future- a kind of perennial philosophy, com- pounded of the religious wisdom of Mahayana, Hindu, Islam, and Christian- ity-is not likely to be easily recognized as such, except by some exceedingly lib- eral theologians. He considers it neces- sary to regard the beliefs of present Christianity as parochial and is confident that the task of the "student of History" is to sift the pure spirit of religion from the "psychic anthropomorphism" of his- torical Christian teachings. Traditional Christianity is likened by Toynbee to the river Nile in flood, a thick brown stream mixing water (the spirit) with the heavy silt (historical accretions) of its banks, and he looks to the day when this river can shed its freight as sediment and be- come, as it was at the beginning, a life- giving rain from heaven: From now onwards, mile by mile, the water converts its suspended alluvium into fertile fields and, in the creative act, progressively</page><page sequence="8">146 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION liberates itself, until, as it leaves the utmost fringe of the Delta behind it and breasts its way out to sea, it has become once more as clear and transparent as it was when it was falling from the sky on its way to furrow a contaminating yet fructifying Mother Earth. Attractive as Toynbee's simile may be, it nevertheless leaves him, personally, with a Christianity which has been de- liberately disembodied. One cannot tell whether it then has lost all historicity or whether, in fact, it is so conceived to congrue the better with the historical viewpoint. In a sense one is almost tempted to say that Toynbee simply wishes to have his cake and eat it; for, on the one hand, he writes that "we have obviously, for a number of generations past, been living on spiritual capital, I mean clinging to Christian practice with- out possessing the Christian belief and practice unsupported by belief is a wast- ing asset" ;12 but, on the other hand, he fails to subscribe to beliefs which tradi- tional Christianity regards as sine qua non, seeking, on the contrary, to show that the higher religions of the present world are "philosophically equivalent" expressions of the same, emerging world religion.13 If his choice falls ultimately on the Christian church as the carrier of future responsibility, the considerations are extrinsic to Christian teaching and have reference to certain survival poten- tials which Toynbee, as the historian, discerns in it. His ultimate concern, how- ever, is for a unified world which he sees to be the product of the historical proc- ess; a world which, in some sense, will apparently have shed the conflicts which presently are tearing civilization apart. And Christianity is plainly the anticipa- tion of, or even the transitional stage to, this state of peace, and Toynbee values it accordingly. (Nothing is more reveal- ing of contemporary social sciences than their almost pathological sensitivity to the facts of conflict; and they rarely seem to consider their procedures justified un- less they can prognosticate the ultimate suspension of social and historical con- flict within the framework of historical so- ciety. Toynbee is no exception, though he dwells extensively on the conflicts of his- tory as its primary law.) In explanation of Toynbee's intricate position and his efforts to run Christian- ity and history into each other, it is per- haps well to see that his method deter- mines his results. Looking at religion from the speculative distance of the uni- versal historian, who sees all events in the light of the completed process, he seeks to disengage the "accidents" of re- ligion, its institutions and specific, exclu- sive doctrines from its "essence"; looking at history from the standpoint of re- ligious "otherworldliness," he finds all "secular" history dross, a barren repeti- tion for at any rate the last four to five centuries. The result seems protean in the extreme. A historical anthropology is grafted onto a mystic piety. Ancient civilizations and religions, dead or living, are all case studies to arrive at the norms for all civilizations and religions, past or future; but thereafter Toynbee follows in the tradition of the eighteenth-century deists in seeing this to be a demonstration of the congruence of the natural dynam- ics of history to the spiritual or moral providence of God. The rationalism of the deists is, of course, supplanted by historicism. And historicism inflates, by a great deal, the values of sheer historical success or, in the case of Toynbee, of suc- cession. The prospects of Christianity under such auspices are quite negative. As Toynbee's Study reveals, the choice falls between a militant, religious autoc- racy and a disenchantment with history so severe as to assume nihilistic propor- tions, making meaningless any concrete-</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTIANITY, HISTORY, AND MR. TOYNBEE 147 ness of Christian belief in a redemptive history. This can be said in spite of Toynbee's declaration that the "greatest new event" in history was still "the Crucifixion and the Crucifixion's spirit- ual consequences.""4 Toynbee's view congrues much more with an Old Testa- ment than with a New Testament view of history. What is, for the Christian, the event of history-the Crucifixion-is turned by Toynbee into a paradigm of the value of historical conflict in general. Each struggle is an agony of transcend- ence to a new stage. So the death and failure of civilizations are said to be re- deemed in that they lead on to higher stages of religious(?), historical life. "If we ask why the descending movement in the revolution of the wheel of civilisation should be the sovereign means of car- rying the chariot of religion forward and upward, we shall find our answer in the truth that religion is a spiritual activity and that spiritual progress is subject to a 'law' proclaimed by Aeschylus in the two words iraOe t .0dos--to suffer is to learn."15 This, to put it briefly, is not the same order of agony or redemption as that of the Crucifixion; nor is it con- gruent with Greek tragedy, which is ren- dered inert by the notion of progress. Toynbee's concern is with the salvation of history in history and, as a "Christian evolutionist," he has not the means to accept the singleness and redemptive meaning of the Incarnation. Rather, his- tory as a process sui generis is its own re- peated incarnation. In final analysis, the Study of History reads as a sort of epi- logue to the Origin of Species, and per- haps it is not unfair to call it the work of the last of the great nineteenth-century philosopher-historians. Writing from the viewpoint of a subse- quent generation, the question arises whether it will not prove irrelevant, when history itself is in question, to work on in terms of a dialectic of history. Histori- cism can so easily become just an elegiac reconstruction of the past and its philoso- phies of life, and it tends to make of the future an impossible predicament pre- cisely because it represents the living process as already having been. Granted that the motive is to come to terms with an increasingly difficult future; but such a motive is ill served by that passion-or is it anxiety?-peculiar to the historicist: to be on the winning side. So, also, a re- alignment of present civilization with Christianity, in the name of history, might prove an obstacle just to those who wish to make their conversion to Christianity. For all the importance that history has, the individual stands in an asymmetrical relationship to it; to be identified with it is to be lost in it. And to identify Chris- tianity with the historical process is to lose the Christian. For the Christian to be on the winning side in history should be the very last of his expectations. As one wise person has put it: "The real struggles are not fought on condition that they shall be won." Moreover, the contemporary world gives cause for an even more acute question, which looms before everyone. Who could win, or could wish to win, in the event that history, as we know it, should itself meet defeat? The guilt of survival would be intoler- able. There can be little doubt left, there- fore, that the Christian standpoint must be associated not with historical but with apocalyptic vision. The situation is one in which it becomes paramount to recog- nize and to acknowledge the full extent of human impotence, both spiritual and historical. Even the "To be or not to be?" of Hamlet has ceased to be a ques- tion. Hamlet's struggle possessed a tragic</page><page sequence="10">148 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION eminence because it freed the destiny of Denmark from the yoke of that singular conscience which would not let him sur- vive the father whom he had, and yet had not, killed. Besides, Hamlet was a play, and it had relevance because it purged. Today there is no play, for actor and audience are one. Denmark is the world, the murdered king is Providence, and all of us are Hamlets, petty princes who, unlike Hamlet, cannot decline their sovereignty, no matter what the guilt incurred in its acquisition. And the days of vicarious suffering and catharsis are passed-which may be why, in modern criticism, Hamlet's attitude has been branded all over again as insane or patho- logical. But if psychology has undertaken to re-enact the role of Polonius, it, in turn, reflects the new perplexity: no liv- ing creature, no Horatio, is likely to re- port us and our cause to the yet unknow- ing world; hence Hamlet's "To be or not to be?" would fail us even in soliloquy. Neither "laceration" nor "sanity" is suf- ficient. Both are apt to be only attitudes of mind. So, skirting the Scylla and Charybdis of self-pity and complaisance, we ask: Have we any longer the choice of being Hamlet or Claudius? Apocalypse is neither a prophecy of disaster nor a death wish. It represents a sober transvaluation of the futurity of history. There will be a judgment on his- tory; thus far Toynbee's intuition truly recovers the missing dimension of West- ern civilization. But the judgment is not the judgment of man or of history. Men continue to be bound to their historical present. As Kierkegaard stated it in his Journals: "Life must be understood backward, but it must be lived forward." It happened that the nineteenth century attempted to do the reverse. Future and present became part of a construct of es- sentially retrospective rationalization, and life became a slave to speculative reason.l6 And precisely because this meant historicizing existence, the nine- teenth century established an era whose conditions became increasingly incoher- ent and irrational. The public contagious- ness of modem life and the powder-keg nature of its technology are consequen- ces. Ideologies are not less so; they are the pathological response to an overly rationalized life, and the fate of Chris- tianity is the threatened involvement which this implies. Hence the invitation for an apocalyptic intuition to emanci- pate belief from historical and rational considerations and to vest it in absolute truth. The future belongs not to the realm of prediction or predication but to "fear and trembling." So does truth. It was David Hume who pointed out to a rationalistic world the existential priority of passion over reason. This must now be implemented in the discovery of what passion is-love and suffering, de- votion and ordeal. This alone would be enough; but it is a matter not only of saying it. On the contrary, it is as though the intellect had become too knowledge- able and thought and feeling proceeded too exclusively from the nerve ends of the cerebral self. But, if so, it cannot be un- done. In the recent words of Robert J. Oppenheimer, "learning is irreversible"; so also it is impossible to resign from a given historical destiny, even though the implication is that we are bound to his- tory as to a wheel of our own designing. To sacrifice the intellect now would mean capitulating to the judgment of history, when it is our history which is under judgment. "If we must live with a perpetual sense that the world and the men in it are ... too much for us, let it be the measure of our virtue that the limits of our powers</page><page sequence="11">CHRISTIANITY, HISTORY, AND MR. TOYNBEE 149 correspond to some special wisdom in our choice of life, of learning or of beauty." These also are words from Oppenheimer, and few men can venture to say that they have arrived at a point beyond his. Nev- ertheless, his stoic statement is of a piece still, in its hesitations of belief, with Mme de Stail's call, quoted at the beginning, to adopt "some" belief. One further leap is necessary. The indecisiveness becomes the less plausible as traditions recede without replacement, values corrode, and civilization confronts its own malevo- lence. Culture is the fruit and not the tree of life; nor can we further put our moral weight on well-composed philosophies. To exist will be to be exposed, and his- tory's appurtenances will not protect. The laws of the spirit are not the laws of survival. One is a Christian in spite of history- not because or on behalf of it. For a very long time it seemed that good faith con- sisted of men's devotion to their history, for, if men made history, it was a logical fidelity that they should uphold its re- sults and trust in its future beneficence (progress). But history abandons men. The truth emerges painfully: history is the realm of power, and power has no love for men-it uses them. Hence men are called upon to learn to turn their cheek to history. They may, of course, abandon it vengefully in disappointed love; such is nihilism. But not if the heart is freed of a misunderstanding and is filled in this moment of belatedness by another love-a love which is, and al- ways was, revealed only to the an- guished, in betrayal, in failure, and in death. History is an undoing; the fight for good against evil is tragic in the his- torical setting, not epic, and only when men have understood this will it be pos- sible to define the role of Christianity in history.
