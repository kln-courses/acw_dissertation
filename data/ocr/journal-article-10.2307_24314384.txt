Unlike those who believe that Mexico's culture of death has already been thoroughly ex plored, we are more inclined to think it comprehends a richer universe than what is widely claimed, and that there is much to be learned about it. Every one of our publications seeks to escape stereotypes and clichés by approaching the topic at hand from often unexpected angles. In our first foray into this subject matter (The Rituals of Child Death, issue no. 15), we brought attention to an until then little known facet of the aesthetic rituals of death in Mexico, and even baptized that artistic genre with a name that has since been used as if it had always gone by that appellation. This was a trailblazing publication, creating concepts and new ways of understanding—a fundamental part of the cultural project that is Artes de México. In this issue we have chosen to tackle the phenomenon of the Day of the Dead, but leaving aside its urban aspect for another occasion, and instead concentrating on the many variants on this celebration to be found in small towns throughout the country, most of them with a largely indigenous population. During this holiday period, most normal activities are suspended. Homes and cemeteries are transformed, taking on a new guise and an entire range of meanings. The living expectantly await the annual visit of the souls with whom they will interact, establishing an intense dialogue with them. The dead come to life in the memory of the living, who evoke their particular customs, tastes, virtues and de fects. There is no room for rejection here, but perhaps for a certain degree of reproach. In each community, this dialogue takes on a specific form: strict standards of hospitality and millenary codes of conduct that each participant understands entirely, because the laws governing that interaction are the laws of life. In communities that celebrate the Day of the Dead there are no surprises. But for those who have an outsider's view of these celebrations, the surprises are many. In this dialogue between the living and the dead, incarnated in altars and offerings, we note one surprising common denominator: their strong aesthetic sense. In ephemeral compositions made of earth, flowers, candles, baskets, colored paper, wooden or iron crosses and even plastic ornaments, we recognize one of the more fertile dimensions of folk art. In each of these majestic offerings, we dis cover a transcendent and vital art form, as well as an unburdening of the soul that detonates in an explosion of forms and colors. There are some offerings that, with a handful of marigold pet als and two or three candles, form a composition of great simplic ity and harmony in tones of deep ocher. Others are more baroque, and reveal an aesthetic dimension that satisfies by demonstrating a natural adeptness at creating beauty. More than a celebration of the dead, are the creators of these works not celebrating life? Might these rituals not be an intense prolongation of life in the midst of death? It would be impossible to mention the thousands of Day of the Dead rituals that are carried out every year in Mexico. The small sample we present on these pages is eloquent enough. The authors have indicated the pre-Hispanic echoes in some of these rituals, but also the direct influence our Hispanic history has had on them. Dominique Dufétel shows us certain similarities in the customs and beliefs of both cultural sources. Given the fact that at the time of the Spanish conquest, a Mexica celebration of death happened to coincide with the European All Saints' Day, he suggests that these two holidays merged to give rise to the grandiloquence and fervor with which the Day of the Dead is currently received. Ruth D. Lechuga outlines some of the characteristics of the cer emonies as celebrated among the Huastecs, Totonacs, Nahuas and Chatinos, discovering some of them to be reminiscent of certain pre-Hispanic practices. However, she clarifies that while Chris tians "pray for the souls of the dead, indigenous people pray to them." Five centuries after evangelization, this kind of religiosity has remained valid. During the time she spent with the Huaves of San Mateo del Mar in the 1950s, Laurette Séjourné realized that in this commu nity on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, altars to the dead were not dedicated to any one person in particular. All souls were welcomed on the Day of the Dead, and were free to visit any home they pleased. However, those who met their death outside of town are turned away, as they are considered unwanted strangers. Teotitlán del Valle in the state of Oaxaca is a community of extraordinary weavers who hold onto their traditions with extreme passion. Mary Jane Gagnier has formed part of that community for over fifteen years. She possesses a profound understanding of the unseen details and meanings of the Day of the Dead ritual, and generously shares them with us here. Her story reveals the deep interpersonal ties that exist in that community, and how these rituals bring people even closer together. Her testimony is both enlightening and astounding. From Fernando Benitez, we receive several stories told to him by a Mazatec Indian from the Sierra of Oaxaca, dire warnings of the punishment awaiting anyone who does not receive the dead as ordained. Then, Marta Turok describes how in Central Mexico and ur ban areas, the market has generated a demand for objects that in the past were used for offerings, eventually converting them into a decorative art form far removed from their original usage. It is clear that many woodcarvers, potters and other artisans have found economic benefits in the spectacular aspect of this ritual. Gabriela Olmos undertakes a symbolic reading of the Day of the Dead based on the ideas of renowned religious historian Mircea Eliade. This article hypothetically remits us to ancient agricultural ceremonies "linking death and the possibility of renewal." Skulls are an important part of the urban celebration of Day of the Dead, but they have little or no presence in rural festivities. This symbol contributes to the tendency to believe that the Mexi can identity is based on a specific relationship with death. It also represents another type of relationship linked to defiance and laughter. The urban fiesta has lost virtually all trace of religious significance, but that does not imply that artistic sensibilities are not keen in this setting as well, nor that the celebration is any less important. For this reason, the representation of skulls in sugar, chocolate, paper cutouts and paper maché will be the focus of a later publication on the Day of the Dead. For the present, we hope that this issue of Artes de México will transport you to a world full of beauty and serenity. Translated by Michelle Sudernian. Page 65: Diana Molina.

To realize just how profoundly an cient the tradition is; suffice it to wander through the great markets of Mexico City such as the one at Xochimilco— during the days prior to All Souls7 Day and see the stalls heaped with these "flowers of the dead;" to visit any Mexican graveyard on November 2 and become dizzy from the pungent scent; to surrender to the environment created by these blooms as they steep altars, tombs and the paths of souls in a unique aesthetic. The flower of countless petals, the flower of in finity (cempasúchil: cempoalxóchitl, flower of twenty petals, i.e. an infinite number of them) is piled into golden drifts over any thing connected with the deceased during those days. But despite this evidence, a glance at the principal sources of our knowl edge regarding the holy days and ceremo nies of the ancient Mexicans will indicate that no such association existed, that while the plant is assuredly both antique and na tive, it was used in a range of festivals as just one among many other species that were considered no less important in the endless game of fiesta, life and sacrifice. PRE-HISPANIC FESTIVALS OF DEATH There were not one but many ways to honor the deceased throughout the eigh teen months of the Aztec year, and these occasions tended to be tied to other events, which might lead us to the hasty conclusion that following the conquest, all the forms of celebrating the afterlife became condensed into the days ordained for this purpose by the Christian religion. Nevertheless, closer study reveals that there were two ceremo nies valued over and above all other rituals of death: the first fell in the ninth month, Tlaxochimaco, also known as Miccailhu itontli which means "small feast of the dead" or "feast of the small dead;" the sec ond took place during the following month, Xócotl Uetzi, or Hueymiccaihuitl, meaning the great feast of the dead. It is very likely that the proceedings were scheduled for the last of the twenty days that made up each month. This is perhaps the reason why the two days of commemoration if the dead came to be held on the first and second days of November in the Gregorian calendar, first the children's day, then the adults', as in the old tradition. Aside from these two major celebra tions, the cult of the dead was practiced on other occasions, each consecrated to a differ ent category of souls, In the Mesoamerican conception of the World, the individual's conditions of existence alter death depended not so much on the manner in which he or she had lived—like it does for the pro foundly ethical Christian religion—as on the manner of death, a circumstance which was in any case predestined by the magical calendar from birth. During the feast of Te peilhuitl, for example, people made "images of mountains out of tzoalli paste in honor of the high peaks where the clouds gather, and in memory of those who had perished in water or after being struck by lightning, or those whose bodies were not incinerated but buried"—that is, those destined for the paradise ruled by Tlaloc. During the month of Quecholli, the victims of battle were re membered: the warriors who were now escorting the Sun in its climb to the zenith, before descending during the afternoon in the form of butterflies and hummingbirds. Izcalli was the month of the Tamale Feast, in honor of the fire god Xiutecuhtli. The cer emony involved an offering of five tamales to the flames of the hearth; to honor them, one was also placed on every grave, to indi cate that this was not the resting place for common remains. "This was done before eat ing the tamales and afterward they would eat them all, not leaving a single one." Such ceremonials were part and parcel of other more important ones, for each month was dedicated to a god who was— in Mesoamerican cosmology as in many other religions—originally or most primi tively an ancestor. Numerous Amerindian myths feature an ancestor who becomes a hero and eventually, over time, acquires the status of a god. In the highly complex struc ture of the Mexican religion, dominated by the pantheon of gods, the cult of the dead seems to be confined to the familial sphere and closely concerned with lineage. The custom of cremating the dead (probably in herited from the Toltecs but ideally suited to the physical conditions of the Valley of Mexico, a vast lagoon which did not lend itself to the excavation of large-scale tombs) doubtless had a marked affect on the nature of the mortuary rites and may go some way toward explaining the secondary role of the Day of the Dead. The tomb as such, a phys ical space that enjoys considerable relevance in today's ritual, was virtually nonexistent then; hence, perhaps, the stress on altars to the dead as stand-ins for the memorial headstone. DEATH'S GREAT ANNUAL CYCLE OF THE DEAD It is important to explore the possible sym bolic relations between pre-Hispanic tributes to the dead and the larger feasts with which they were articulated, since, as Mircea Elia de asserts, "The symbol delivers its message and fulfils its purpose even when its mean ing is not consciously apprehended." One point must be emphasized with re gard to the ancient calendar. The Mexicas had a solar year of 365 days (divided into eighteen twenty-day months, plus five spare days of ill omen), but it seems they neglected to adjust for the astronomical er ror (for instance by adding, as we presently do, one day every four years). Given that their calendar originated sometime during Dominique Dufétel Ruth D. Lechuga. Devils' Dance. La Estancia Grande;Oaxaca. 1963.</page><page sequence="5">the Toltec era, corresponding to the eighth century AD; it must have been at least six months behind by the time of the conquest. This led to a glaring mismatch between the point in the agricultural cycle which each month purported to mark—especially in its way of worshipping gods who were con sistently associated with nature—and the actual season of the fiesta's celebration. We may suppose that, as in any tradition whose origins have been lost, the Mexicas soldiered on with their rites but in some confusion, suggesting a cult which stands closer to reli giosity than to mysticism. The first of the two main feasts of the dead—dedicated to the children as we men tioned earlier—was dubbed Miccailhuitontli by the other peoples of the Mexican Alti plano, but the Mexicas called it Tlaxochi maco, or "birth of flowers." The central act of this ceremony was to offer up "the early and incipient buds/' the chroniclers tell us; unfortunately, though, during the sixteenth century the date fell in August, when flow ers are in full bloom. Back in the eighth cen tury, of course, it came in February, around the time when the first buds begin to emerge across the Altiplano. This enables us to un derstand the significance of the infant deaths that were offered up on this occasion to the supreme deity, Huitzilopochtli, alongside the first flowerings of the natural cycle: these small dead souls were headed directly for the highest heaven, that is, for the divine place above all others, where they would be reabsorbed into the vital magma that gave birth to every being. Hence their premature death was no misfortune, but a divine sac rifice. Two days before this feast," relates the anthropologist and friar Sahagún, "the whole populace took to the meadows and cornfields to look for flowers, blossoms of the woods and of the countryside, some of which are called..." and he writes out a long list of floral names, all corresponding to the rainy season, except for the marigold which in those days seems to have flowered earlier than its usual season. The next day at dawn, he continues, "they braided them with cord to make thick ropes from them, long and twisted, which they then hung in their pa tios, to be presented to the god whose feast they were celebrating." Within this ritual, the flowers did not con stitute an offering to the dead children: rath er they were a representation of those same children who were to be offered up to the god. Then "on the last day of the month, the men went into the hills to cut down a whole tree, smoothed it and brought it as far as the entrance to the city. This log was worshipped with offerings, foodstuffs and incense. They called it by the name of xócotl" (which evolved into the word jocote, the bitter tasting fruit of the yellow ¡ocotero tree). The following month was the feast of Xó cotl Uetzi, dedicated to the "large" or adult dead. At this time, writes Durán "they lifted the tree off the ground and set it upright in the temple forecourt and placed on top a richly decorated bird formed of dough." Al ternatively, Sahagún wrote that this crown ing figure was a molded image of the god Xiutecuhtli, as it was his feast day. The climactic moment of the proceedings oc curred when a band of youthful volunteers shinned up the smooth trunk in a race to reach the bird and wrench off its head and other parts. The first four to make it were the winners, and these had to perform im mediate penitence. Later the same day the trunk was pulled down and hacked to piec es by the road, who took these chips home with them as though they were relics—adds Durán— "because that is the meaning of the name Xócotl Uetzi, the fall of the xócotl." This fiesta, originally held in February, reminds us of the modern ritual of the "fly ing trunk," a legacy of the prestigious cul tures of the Gulf coast. Though it is most notorious in the Papantla area, among to day's Totonac groups, it takes a more inte gral form among the Otomi peoples who live in the mountains of Puebla and Hidalgo states. Here it occupies a prime place in the Carnival, in keeping with the indigenous cosmovision. According to the anthropolo gist Jacques Galinier, who has recorded all the variants of this Otomi rite, "Carnival marks the beginning of the annual count (of days)" and is the first of the two markers of the year:" the first inter-equinoxial phase, lasting six months (from March to October) is separated from the second (November to February) by the two hinge dates: Carni val and the Day of the Dead." These twin poles of the calendar display another feature in common: both are moments when, "ev ery year, the dead come and go between their abode and the village." To the extent that it may be legitimate to extrapolate pre-Hispanic thinking from the study of contemporary indigenous peoples, there ap pears to be ample evidence for the conclu sion that the Mexica feast of Xócotl Uetzi (whose possible Otomi origins cannot be dismissed, argues Galinier) combined the nature of today's Carnival with that of the Day of the Dead. In the Otomi dance of the volador, or flying man, four "viejos" or elders climb to the eyrie at the top of the pole and another performer called the "Malinche" dances there in the character of an eagle or hawk, rep resenting the solar bird. The "viejos" come spinning down again, in reference to the descent into the underworld of the dead, while the flight of the "Malinche" enables o 69 it to soar up to heaven. In Galinier's view, "the Huastecs regard the voladores as god like departed souls who escort the Sun until it disappears." Like the ancient xócotl, the pole (a cosmic phallus) from which voladores launch their descent to the ground can be in terpreted as an axis of the world that enables people to circulate between its several levels. "The pole is the numen of fertility, linked to a life-principle symbolized by the eagle and to a death-principle embodied in the presence of the old men," Galinier writes. The ancient ritual of climbing the pole to behead the solar bird of corn paste (surviv ing in the Otomi "Malinche") is a way of taking hold of the Sun, fount of all life, precisely on a day that celebrates the dead, or more exactly, one of the periodic visits the souls make to humankind. It took place originally, just like the present-day Otomi carnival, during a barren season for the land, around February, when it was necessary to call upon the power of the gods—that is, of the people's occult ancestors—in order for the Earth to become fruitful once more. It so happens that the sacred days we have already mentioned corresponding to the month of Quecholli—those dedicated to men slain in battle—coincided during the sixteenth century with the feast of All Saints in the Gregorian calendar. During those days, also consecrated to Mixóatl, god of hunting and astral fire, the Mexicas got together to make arrows and darts for Paul Czitrom. Tetelcingo, Puebla. 1999. Paul Czitrom. Tetelcingo, Puebla. 1999.</page><page sequence="6">use in war and the hunt. On the last day of the month, they made smaller arrows which were lashed together in fours, mixed with splinters of ocote pine. These bundles were placed on the graves of the warriors as offerings, next to a pair of tamales. They lay there for the space of a day; un til at nightfall, the bunches of wood were burned. Here as on other occasions we note the absence of marigolds, and yet the image of those bundles of arrows flaring orange in the night cannot but remind us of those flowers, with their fiery hues and masses of slender petals, placed on tombs now. This other feast of the dead took place in early November, when at the exact point where the sun went down it was possible to discern the figure of Mixcóatl, the principal Chichimeca deity, adopting his form as the Cloud Serpent. In this case there seems to have been an adjustment made to match the ritual with the appropriate season—a later adaptation, perhaps. Whatever the reason, the fact that it coincided, at the time of the Conquest, with the Catholic ritual of All Saints' must surely have some bearing on the fervor and pomp with which this Chris tian holy day—not of first-rank importance in Europe— has been observed in Mexico since then. This syncretic adaptation man ages to concentrate into just two days, No vember 1 and 2—all the expressions of the great annual cycle of death. However, if we accept—as Galinier's tes timonies about present-day Otomi tribes suggest—that in pre-Hispanic times, the an cestors manifested themselves twice a year, at the time of the equinoxes, then what ancient rites associated with this twofold break in the Earth's lifecycle might be re lated with the cult of the dead? The month after Xócotl Uetzi was Ochpaniztli, which would have correspond ed to March during the eighth century. This was a time to celebrate the divine Toci, mother of the gods and heart of the Earth. On the last of its twenty days, a woman representing the goddess was sacrificed by being skinned alive. The high priest put on her skin to dance all day long, and the skin of her things was used to make the mask of the com god, Cintéotl. Six months later, during the month of Tlacaxipehualiztli, it was the god Xipe Tótec;s turn to be honored with a similar sacrifice, but this time it was a man whose skin was worn by the priest. And thus it becomes clear that contrary to the common belief, the Náhuatl scholar Salvador Diaz Cintora is correct to argue that Xipe Tótec was not the god of spring we once thought, he was a deity of the fall. The man's fresh skin donned by the high priest was subsequently pre served for days "until it tore"—this was now a yellow, stained, decaying scrap of hide, not the firm flesh of Toci that heralds spring and summer. It is the parchment-textured skin of a "viejo"—a dead man indeed-that ushers in the fall and winter. As Diaz Cin tora writes, "Half the year, then, is governed by Xipe Tótec, the god of the Zapotee and Tlapanec coasts; the other half, by the moth er goddess of the Huasteca regions, and the coast of the Seno Mexicano. (...) During Tlacaxipehualiztli, one man, the priest, dress es in the skin of another, the sacrificial vic tim: this is undiluted masculinity, necessarily sterile. In Ochpaniztli, the priest covers him self with a woman's skin: (...) here the mas culine element conjoins with the feminine, getting literally under her skin, as a sacra ment of fertility ensuring life on Earth." Furthermore, during the month conse crated to Xipe Tótec a kind of bread called cocolli was prepared from the sacred grains of certain ears of com known as ocholli that were strung from the eaves by their wrap pings after the harvest. It was exclusively these grains and no others that had to be sown the following year, because these were the seed of a god who both embodied and heralded death: Cocolli was thus a sacred offering of bread, com bread, yellow as the leathery skin of Xipe Tótec, a food that au gured the death of nature and might well lie at the origins of our contemporary fan de muerto (a special bread baked for the Day of the Dead). When the rains have vanished from the sky and the Earth enters a period of repose before it becomes cloaked in the parched skin of vegetation burnt by frosts and winter sun, before the ordeal of coming drought—then the land sprouts a fleece of yellow flowers: sunflowers, Santa Maria flowers and above all the extraordinary heads of marigold, with their warm golden shades, like the reflec tion of a nocturnal sun, an orange-yellow as beautiful and poignant as the feeling of fare well to summer. Who could deny that this symbol of hidden forefathers has its roots buried deep in pre-Hispanic Mexico? Translated by Loma Scott Fox. OBLIGATORY FIESTA DAY OF THE ♦DEATH* RITUALS Ruth D. Lechuga THE FACE OF INDIGENOUS DEATH As Paul Westheim notes, "The only thing Mexico's Day of the Dead has in common with All Souls' Day, as celebrated in Eu rope, is the fact that on both sides of the ocean it is a day dedicated to the memory of deceased loved ones." Whereas for Europeans the very men tion of death is taboo—as if by rejecting the idea one could avoid the fact—Mexicans ac custom themselves with the notion from childhood. This familiarity is evidenced in many ways; for example, in the many ex pressions to say that a person died: he got peeled, hit the mat, stretched a leg, carpeted Paul Czitrom. Tetelcingo, Puebla. 1999. Loma Scott Fox. Ruth D. Lechuga Paul Czitrom.

There is a difference in the ritual too: Eu ropeans visit the cemetery on All Souls7 Day to remember departed loved ones whereas Mexicans see this as a time when their de ceased return to the Earth to spend the day with their relatives. Even the pre-Hipanic custum of dedicating one day to dead chil dren and another to dead adults has been handed down. Currently, the fiesta might last several days longer than the two assigned to dead children and adults respectively. María Cristina Morales tell us, for ex ample, that in the Huastec Indian region of the state of Hidalgo, St. Michael is believed to open up the gates of Heaven for souls to begin their pilgrimage to visit the living on September 30, then St. Andrew closes them on November 30, by which date all souls should have returned to their dwelling place. The Totonacs in the sierra wind up their festivities on St. Andrew's Day as well. Re searchers at the Totonac language school claim they also dedicate St. Luke's Day (Oc tober 18) to people who have died a violent death: in an accident, murdered, drowned. The Totonacs of Papanda, Veracruz, and the Nahuas of Cuetzalan, Puebla, assign a special day, October 30, to non-baptized children and, according to Simón Gómez Atzin, they call it "the day of people in limbo/' The annual visit from the deceased is no mournful occasion, but an excuse for a par ty. Perhaps one explanation for that appears in the Madrilenian Codex, from Sahagún's Aztec informants: "The elders used to say he who has died has become a god. Their turn of phrase 'he became god' means 'he died.'" In fact, Robert Childs and Patricia Altman assure us the belief persists that "a dead per son's soul becomes a supernatural being with the power to intercede on behalf of family members." They further point out another idiosyncrasy of the Mexican Day of the Dead that differs from the European equivalent: "in the orthodox Catholic faith one prays for the souls of the dead to be saved from purgatory. Indigenous people, on the other hand, do not pray for souls, but to them." As they did with the gods of the past, people must pray to their ancestors to look favorably upon the requests of the living: ancestors too expect their offerings. So de scendants must set aside a little of their time and money to fete them accordingly. Every village has its tale about a person who failed to lay out an offering with due respect and was punished by the dead. The penalty im posed may range from a flogging even to the death of the disobliging relative. For example in an account discovered by Fernando Horcasitas, a sorcerer in Milpalta relates how a woman asked her son to fetch some wood and buy what was necessary for an offering. Instead, the boy messed around all day playing on the mountain and when he wanted to return, "he noticed a long pro cession of old people coming up behind him. He saw his father, his grandparents, great grandparents, great-great-grandparents, all trembling with cold, dying of hunger and thirst, carrying their empty knapsacks and rolled-up sleeping mats under their arms, all anxious to return home where they were awaited, to warm themselves, eat and spend the night. 'What are you doing here?' they complained, 'Why aren't you waiting for us back in the house?' The startled boy was speechless. The dead tied him to a tree and left him there all night. At dawn, as the fra grant smoke from the copal incense lifted and faded, and the offering candles went out one by one, the defunct old people plod ded slowly back through the forest again, untied the boy and continued on their way. The boy fled home to his mother crying, 'Now I know that the dead people really do come back; next year we'll buy them their food and wait for all of them.'" Another story, told by researchers at the Totonac language school, had a more tragic ending. There was a man who did not be lieve in the dead and disregarded their day. On his way home after a drinking binge, "he suddenly saw a crowd coming towards him, but they were all dead people returning to their world. Among them were his father and mother with empty arms, while others were loaded with offerings. He saw that his deceased family carried only a piece of clay (tepalcate) as a censer; it was burning their hands, and they were lamenting their sorry state and full of complaints. Soon after he had returned home, he began to feel dizzy and nauseous, then quickly fell ill and died all of a sudden. The meal he had asked to be prepared for the offering served only as a meal for his own burial." After the fiesta, the dead must return to their dwelling place. A few, reluctant to do so, hang around their relatives' house, pos sibly with the idea of becoming prankster spirits. Some communities hold special cer emonies to avoid that. Frances Toor tell us that "in Yalalag, Oaxaca, the priest walks right through the village in the company of musicians chanting prayers for the dead and Salve Reginas, with or without music, de pending on how much people are prepared to spend. The chanting takes place both in side and outside the houses to ensure that no soul is hiding, because some of them get lost along the way and others are reluctant to go back where they came from. At the sound of the prayers they must depart and stop upsetting their relatives." The Totonacs in the sierra make another small offering on St. Andrew's Day. "In the afternoon they go to the graveyard, bearing the cross and part of their offering. As a fare well they recite the rosary and sing praises to dissuade departed souls from returning to bother family members." The Chatino Indians of Yaitepec, Oax aca, make a procession to the cemetery to es cort adult souls back to their tombs. Masked dancers go from house to house making a lot of noise to expel any souls that have yet to take their due leave. DANCING FOR THE DEAD Throughout Mexico it is common to place an offering—inaccurately called an "altar for the dead"—at the house of the deceased, the cemetery, or both. Food, drink, flowers, and ^ lights are the staples. However, local varia tions abound. The Totonacs of Papanda, Veracruz, who are meticulous about their appearance and always carry a bag with a change of clothes should they get dirty, place a set of clean clothes for the deceased to put on when they arrive so that they can enjoy the party. Offerings can be made at the cemetery during the day, such as in San Gabriel Chilac in Puebla. As family members arrive, they will sit down around the graves that are fes tooned with flowers, candles, baskets, food, and figures of angels. If they can afford it, lulio Galindo. Mazahua cemetery. 1985. Julio Galindo. Mazahua cemetery. 1985.</page><page sequence="8">they will pay a musician with a portable piano or mariachis to cheer up the dead. As happens elsewhere in Mexico, in the comer of the cemetery locals here will place an offering for those lonely souls without relatives to remember them. Celebrations take place at night in other parts of the country; the cemetery will be filled with candles creating a festive and magical atmosphere. These ceremonies— aptly called iluminadas—also include food, flowers, incense, and, depending on the region, special decorations. In Janitizio and the towns dotted around Lake Pátzcuaro, oranges, bananas and candied figures are hung from large arches clad in marigolds. In Iguatzio, one of the lakeside commu nities, a woman with a banana approached me and said: 'This is for you—from my dead husband who is glad that you're join ing in the party with us." The most remarkable aspect of the ilumi nada is its pre-Hispanic roots. Sahagún wrote about the fiesta for the month of Quecholli (from October 20 to November 8): "they made small darts in honor of the deceased... they would tie four arrows together and four torches with loose cotton threads, and they would place the names on the graves of the deceased. They would also put down a couple of sweet tamales; they left them there for the whole day and at dusk they would light the torches and bum them to gether with the arrows." Many villages hold dances during the Days of the Dead. Some dancers perform in the street, some go from house to house and others dance in the cemetery. In the Huastec region, dancers are called huehues ("elders" in the Náhuatl language) and represent the dead. They dance in cou ples and their jokes often have some sexual innuendo. The Tejorón Indians of Yaitepec, Oaxaca, hide behind the anonymity of a mask when playing practical jokes with rib ald humor. In both instances, it is a fertility ritual, which shows that the pre-Hispanic world view of duality and the endless life death-life cycle continues to live on in the minds of some Mexicans. The Tejorones, however, play another role: they expel souls that drag their feet when the time comes to go home after their day is over. Other dances are staged to amuse the dead. The black population in the coastal towns of Oaxaca call the dancers "devils." In the street they accompany their vigorous movements with chanted improvised verses in reference to their compatriots and visitors. In Acadán, Puebla, the customary dance is called tecuanes, in which multiple char acters take part, including the tiger. They usually dance in honor of the souls on the afternoon on November 2 in a square out side the cemetery; but when anyone in the troupe has a recendy deceased relative they enter the graveyard and perform around his tomb. The devils of Tanquián, San Luis Po tosí, do exacdy the same thing whenever one of their dancers dies. The old folk of Suchiquiltongo, Oaxaca, and the mimics of Romerio, Chiapas, al ways dances inside the cemetery. Children in Tepoztlán, Morelos, have fun dancing with a skeleton virtually their size, made of reeds and lined with tissue paper. One unique spectacle is that of the living graves in Iguala, Guerrero. As a tribute to any person who has died since the last Day of the Dead—and who is generally referred to by the population as a "fresh corpse"—the family will vacate the largest bedroom over looking the street. It then becomes an impro vised actors' set for young family members and children, who usually present a tableau of some religious theme, in which they re main motionless long hours through the night. The town's inhabitants do the rounds to admire each family's inventiveness. Calixta Guiteras relates that in Chenal hó, Chiapas, a special council holds office for one day on behalf of the dead. There is a ceremonial handing over of the cloak and</page><page sequence="9">scepter, in the same manner as when a new council in instated each year. The next day, the authoritative symbols are returned to the everyday governors. Another important ceremony takes place in Huistán, Chiapas, where women sweep the church and the plaza outdoors. This rit ual dates back to pre-Hispanic Mexico. Fray Diego Durán relates, 'The eleventh month of the year was called Ochpaniztli, which means day for sweeping. It was the day of solemn of the gods. (...) The first ceremony of the day required that everyone dust their belongings and sweep out the house. What is more, they swept every street in the vil lage, an ancient custom that has remained with us throughout the land." Here, like in other related ceremonies, pre-Hispanic rituals and beliefs persist despite almost five centuries of evangelization. Translated by Carole Castelli SPELLBINDING FIESTA SAN MATEO ♦DEL MAR'S* WANDERING SOULS Laurette Séjourné In San Mateo del Mar, the dead are feared above all as a cause of illness. It even seems that evil is an inherent quality of those who lie buried beneath the earth, since they only appear to manifest themselves by bringing on some kind of calamity. To think about a dead person is a careless deed which one must swiftly amend by means of offerings and prayers, if one wants to avoid becom ing ill. To invoke a dead person to do evil is common practice; if one is in trouble, one runs a high risk of getting sick, because if a dead relative realizes one is worried, then he or she will send some affliction one's way locals say the deceased dan lástima which normally means "to be pitiful" but in this case could also be interpreted as "to send woes." The most pernicious souls are those of men who died in accidents outside town: since they do not find a place of rest, they wander the earth waiting to enter the body of a living being. Thus it is not uncommon for someone coming back from a long trip to fall gravely ill from having "caught" one of these lost souls. Locals are always con cerned about this type of diagnosis, since the treatment carried out by the specialist con sists of whippings, repeatedly applied until the patient is cured. However, some people claim that these wandering souls are often very stubborn and will commonly let the patient die from the whipping before agree ing to leave their host. All this clearly reveals two characteris tics of San Mateo del Mar's population's mentality: their humble, submissive wor ship of supernatural forces and their depen dence on the group. They feel the singular need to ask for forgiveness when they fall prey to an illness; moreover, they do not carry out any of the rituals by which brujos or witchdoctors usually cure ailments— ritu als implying a sense of active resistance— but simply limit themselves to praying and making offerings. This outlook explains the atmosphere of devotion that reigns over the town: indeed, if one must pray to heal one self, one must also incessantly pray in order to prevent the undifferentiated realm where humans mingle with saints, the departed and animals from ever losing its harmony— as tragedies mainly occur due to some im balance in this homogeneous whole. The community's cohesion is further ex pressed in the fact that no brujo will agree to make someone sick at a client's request something so common elsewhere. Only a traveling brujo would be capable of such a thing, and for this reason strict measures have been adopted so that no out-of-town brujo may enter San Mateo. And just in case one of these undesirable characters were to insist on sticking around, the countless chapels erected on every comer in defense against that would surely convince him otherwise. The All Saints' Day celebrations dem onstrate that the San Mateo native's anon ymous state of existence as well as his or her unconditional dependency on the group also apply to the dead. Dead people's behav ior is closely tied to that of the living, and when a brujo diagnoses a relative as having "dead-person's illness," the invocations he carries out to make the late lamented soul appear are a prime necessity, indispensable to the whole family. In spite of this relation ship's intimacy, souls can wander freely about town once a year, and are then re ceived with a solemn welcome—a custom followed by practically all Mexican ethnic groups. However, in San Mateo—unlike oth er regions of Mexico—the altar each family makes in honor of the celebration is not ded icated to any particular dead person, and this lends the festivities here a totally impersonal character. Something else distinguishes the people of San Mateo del Mar: their aversion to any thing which lies beyond their group identity is so deep-rooted that they even mercilessly "boycott" those townsfolk who died else where, as if their leaving town in the first place makes them as impure as foreigners. The belief that there are souls who have lost the way to their native land is a preva lent one throughout Mexico; however, this was the first time I witnessed a people turn their backs on these spirits. In the different places where I have spent the Day of the Dead, I have always witnessed a general sense of sympathy for wàndering souls: a candle in the doorway or a table of modest offerings inside a house are the alms of hu man memory that each family presents to the lost souls that might pass through. Nothing like this takes place in San Ma teo del Mar, quite the contrary: stray spirits are closely monitored so they cannot freely mingle with the community of respectable dead individuals. People claim that when one of these unwanted souls tries to enter the church, hoping to partake in the offer ings which would allow it to join the ranks of the pure, the front door to the church, outraged, will stop it from coming in. I have heard it said that the priest often sees the heavy door slam shut of its own accord in the face of one of these renegade spirits. A few days ahead of time, the whole community prepares to welcome their dead. At home, women work hard to make the kind of food and drink their dead relatives liked; at the market candles are snatched up the minute they are made, and locals eagerly await the arrival of marigold sales man and the Day of the Dead bread made in the shape of angels, rabbits or deer. (I discovered this kind of bread made for the feast of the Day of the Dead during my trip to San Mateo. When the friendly Zapotee couple's cart in which I was traveling turned over—with all of us inside it, of course—we tried, with the aid of a flashlight that barely dispersed the cold darkness around us, to pick up and clean the objects littered on the ground. I was moved by these oddly shaped breads and did my best so that, in spite of the mishap, they could still grace a table of offerings.) ^ At midday on November 1, church bells start ringing, and the souls—who are only awaiting this sign—rush to the earth. Come dawn they return to their respective rest ing places—some even going back to Hell carrying their offerings from the living. The deceased who leave empty-handed will not forget to shower the worst calamities upon those forgetful enough not to have given them some token to respect. At the toll of the bell, which does not cease ringing until the next morning, the townsfolk greet their dead. They begin by singing prayers in front of each family altar; in the homes of town leaders, secret cere monies take place, reserved exclusively for men; women visit each other's homes of fering as many candles as people they once knew who have died: there are young girls who stand shyly in the doorway to a house holding out a single candle, and old women carrying great bundles of them. The narrow streets become impressively beautiful as they bustle with these women carrying their offerings to and fro. Indeed, once the souls have arrived, the town is sud denly revealed in all its authenticity. The women's attire and behavior, for instance, is very much like that of priestesses used to having an intimate relationship with the su pernatural: the thick red cloth tied around their waists and dropping to the ground; the wide, square black or yellow blouse over their bare chests; the piece of white Opposite page: Nacho López.

Janitzio, Michoacán. n/d.</page><page sequence="10">cotton, as large as a bed sheet, tied around their heads and draping severely over their shoulders and backs. Silent, standing proud and focused, carrying in their hands candles decorated with marigold flowers, they prog ress without any apparent movement, and disappear... Homes are simply multiple churches, all forming part of a single sacred place, and the altar that each one houses is the site that is most alive within them. Numerous candles fill the rooms with golden light, dispelling the usual darkness, since these shacks have no other opening than a very narrow door and the space inside is so confined that hardly any light enters. Fruits, flowers and basil—which plays a very important role in witch craft—as well as burning wax and co pal enshroud everything with an intensely religious perfume. People stand before the tables of offerings to sing prayers with a fervor that will not decline until the next morning. The night, under the full moon's benevo lent glow, further underscores the profound meaning of things, and the whole town ap pears to be under the influence of a spell; the shacks' dark shapes loom over the narrow streets and alleys, oblivious to any sort of rec tilinear order; the ground, warm and shift ing, refuses to stay still beneath our feet; groups of men, floating among the alcoholic vapors of ritual drinking, glide by like sleep walkers; prayers rise above every room like thick columns of smoke... The shack I am staying in can evidently not escape the fate of the others, and I will be unable to sleep by the light of the candles, among the perfumes that get caught in my throat, the noise of the prayers and the con stant comings and goings. The moon is still high when the women get ready to go to the cemetery wearing their prettiest dress es. It is my duty as a researcher to follow them, but it seems like a sacrilegious indis cretion for me to witness their farewells to the dead, and I am truly relieved when they tell me I cannot accompany them. In the doorway, the man of the house chats with some friends of his—all of them completely drunk. Not daring to join them, I stand in a corner for a long while unsure of what to do, listening to their chatter sprinkled with Spanish words. And then, in the most unex pected manner, I hear a song rise above the din, more disturbing and strange than every thing else: a few notes of L'Internationale. Suddenly, the plaza, deserted for the past two days—the street vendors have abandoned it knowing they will not sell anything during the festivities—vibrates with color and movement. Women re turning from the cemetery pass groups of staggering men without noticing them, apparently, as the latter leave the church where, taking turns since the previous evening, they stood guard over the table of offerings. A little later, the plaza will look like the aftermath of a battle: bodies are strewn ev erywhere, men hobble under the hot sun, stoop to regain their balance and take an other few faltering steps before collapsing. Once in a while a woman's hieratic silhou ette appears: she reverentially bends over one of these prostrate bodies and takes it away like a precious burden. Absolutely all the men are totally inebriated: they had no choice but to drink with the visiting souls— indeed, refusing to do so would have been a grievous sin. I overheard a revealing dialogue in this regard: as the young schoolmaster, himself suffering from a dreadful hangover, was asking a venerable old man why he had not done this or that, the latter, surprised by such a question, answered: "But how?... I couldn't, 1 was drinking." 1 must add that this sacred collective binge is ever so peace ful: during the twenty-four hours the men drank, not a single violent incident occurred. The only novelty to report, besides the pla za's and streets' surprising appearance, was that these people, usually so introverted and sullen, had become talkative, even express ing a certain degree of warmth. Translated by Richard Moszka. ♦SAN* GABRIEL CHILAC Gutierre Tibón On the second of November, throughout Mexico the air is filled with our grateful and affectionate thoughts about those loved ones who have come before us in this eter nal dream; we all wish to show them that we have not forgotten them, that they live on in our memory. In thousands and thou sands of cemeteries across the country the faithful departed receive visits from their relatives; countless graves are decorated with the emblematic flower of the dead, the marigold. Though in some places the Day of the Dead is celebrated with more devo tion, more solemnity. I was in a cemetery that I consider unique in Mexico, and per haps in the world. An almost unreal vision of color, beauty, and human tenderness is still etched on my retina. I spent the sec ond of November in Chilac, a town about twenty kilometers from Tehuacán, near the border with the state of Oaxaca. The inhab itants are successful garlic farmers. They are all bilingual, speaking Náhuatl and Spanish with equal ease. They are all literate, and most can even read music. What is unique about the Chilac cem etery? Small shelters—made out of emer ald-green banana leaves, small green carrizo reeds, or black or purple cloth—are erected above each grave. Offerings are placed in the shade: tenate palm-weave baskets filled with bread baked specially for the occasion, mole casseroles, bananas, oranges, and an abun dance of the very freshest flowers in elegant arrangements. Marigolds flutter, with their yellowy-orange color contrasting with the blood-red, velvety flower the locals call moco de favo (amaranth); and the pure white lil ies, the purple gladioli, the carpets of the blue morning glory known as the "virgin's veil" all add to this impressive display. The latter seemed to have waited to flower especially until this morning. Candles—one for each soul being remembered—flicker softly among the offerings and flowers. Family members, from the grandparents to the grandchildren, all sit or kneel in prayer in front of the shel ters. Numerous harmoniums (I counted six teen) are distributed among the graves. The campesinos play the instruments themselves, reading the music like expert organists, and operating the pedals in their huaraches or barefoot. The whole family sing to accom pany the harmonium, their treble and bass voices all perfectly in tune. They sing and pray in perfect Spanish or well-pronounced Latin, though among themselves they speak the mellifluous tongue of the Mexico of old, Náhuatl. Women would occasionally pass by carrying huge bunches of flowers to add even more decoration to the graves. The sky is an intense blue; the perfume of marigolds intermingles with the copal incense burning gently in the censers. Melo dius, angelic voices rise from amid the sea of green, black, and purple shelters. And flow ers everywhere, an apotheosis of flowers. The atmosphere in the cemetery in Chilac is not joyful or sad, but peaceful and serene. I returned to Mexico City with a sense of calm, as though I'd had a foretaste of eternal bliss.

Preparations for their welcome are in the making for days; and beginning October 31, the villagers are already attending spirits. The first to arrive are the angelitos—the souls of dead children— on November 1, All Saints' Day, given that angels and saints have much in common, even residing in the same heavenly abode. They depart just after the first adults begin arriving from the "other world" at 3 p.m. the same day. Officially the souls take leave at 3 p.m. on November 2, but should that day fall on a Sunday—the day liturgically re served for the Lord—the spirits must simply wait and return on November 3. The nor mally industrious town of Teotitlán comes to a grinding halt during these fiestas. Anto nia Ruiz warns that, "No one should work while the spirits are still visiting!" CONSTANT COMPANY AND KIND WORDS It is midday, November 1, and many years have passed since Antonia Ruiz lost her last child. This spirited, compact woman speaks from first-hand experience as she has buried five of her eleven children. She leads me past the newly renovated room where the altar has been set up, across the porch and into her daughters' bedroom. I am initially perplexed to be moving away from the liv ing room, but as we enter into the cool dark ness a small altar emerges. Antonia explains that this was the original living room in the home built by her husband's parents forty years ago. This room had housed the altar until 1980 when Antonia and her husband, Félix, built a new living room. She says she still maintains this small altar because it was here, in this room, that the wake was held when her own children died. This is the place they know. This is the place they come back to. "We receive the spirits here," explains Antonia while her daughter Reina takes down the offerings left on the altar for the children's spirits: peanuts and pecans, tiny egg loaves, miniature clay cups filled with hot chocolate, and the tiny bars of chocolate used for making this essential beverage. "While the angelitos are here we often hear the clinking of ceramics coming from this room," Reina tells me, "the same sound made when you take a drink and place the cup back in the saucer." The same afternoon in another house hold in Teotidán del Valle, Doña Clara Ruiz is already busy attending to four visi tors in her living room when another couple arrives. On a day like today, with so many people coming and going, she has left the front door open. Her sister-in-law Leonora, and her husband Renaldo, enter the room quietly while the other guests fall into a respectful silence. The couple goes direcdy to the altar, unpacking from a large basket their offering of bread, fruit, nuts and a sin gle taper about a meter tall. Leonora's lit candle joins six others on the floor at the base of the altar illuminat ing a framed photograph of Emiliano Men doza, Clara's deceased husband. According to custom the couple kneels respectfully be fore the altar. Only after the dead have been properly greeted do the guests direct their attentions to the living, first Clara, then her adult sons and the other guests. They take their places at the large table and comfort able conversation resumes. The spirits want constant company dur ing their brief twenty-four hour visit. And while virtually every home as its own spir its to attend to, in a tight-knit community like Teotidán, most folks spend a good part of the fiesta paying their respects to deceased relatives at other homes. Hours later, Clara instructs her grown daughter to keep watch over the altar and attend to any visitors while she goes off to visit the homes of several relatives. In the sturdy reed basket tucked under her rebozo she carries a botde of mescal, half a dozen egg loaves and several blocks of chocolate. She will return home more than once to replenish the basket in the course of her obligatory rounds. Her first stop is at the home of her de ceased mother-in-law. The door is open and she slips silendy into the living room, ignor ing the others seated at the long table she moves directly to the altar. She kisses the edge of the altar then kneels to pray. I asked Doña Clara what she prays for at this moment." For the spirit of the deceased to be at peace," she replies. Rising, she greets her brother-in-law, Andrés Ruiz, who as the youngest son, and concurrent with Zapotee custom, still occupies his mother's home. Emerging from the kitchen, Andrés' wife Rosa joins her husband and receives the loaded bas ket from Doña Clara. This same scene has been played out coundess times. Everyone has taken part in it at some point, out of the deep sense of commitment that exists within this community to perform the du ties allotted to each person. Antonia and her husband Félix Mendoza offer their vision of the spirit's comings and goings during the fiesta: "Sometimes the spirits come to visit with friends or maybe a compadre. They also visit other homes apart from where they lived and died—they go to the homes of their children, godpar ents and favorite relatives." So while the living make their rounds, paying their respects to the spirits of loved ones, likewise the spirits have an open invi tation to enjoy the aromas rising from other altars. Even young couples living in new homes where no one they know has died prepare offerings partly for unknown spirits that could return to their ancestral site, and partly for the souls of family members or godparents that might come to visit. Should the need arise to leave their house unoccu pied during the fiesta, such an offense may be remedied by leaving the door to the altar room open, which is symbolic of inviting the souls in to visit. Even worse than offering a half-hearted welcome to the spirits is to not receive them at all. The people of Teotidán have much to say on this matter. Antonia remembers that as a young girl her family moved to a large property in the heart of the village." Many people had lived and died on this land long before we came to it but for years it had been abandoned. When our first Day of the Dead came upon us, in the early hours of November 2, my mother heard moans out in the large courtyard." So, at four in the morning, Victoria González Martínez went out in the dark to reassure the sad souls. She spoke to them and told them that they were welcome. "Don't cry any more. Even though I don't have much to give you, please join us," she said. Almost half a century has gone by now, and the unknown souls have been content, and never a mysterious moan has been heard since. THE OFFERING Each element of the family altar assures spir its that they have come to the right home. For that reason, whenever possible, photo graphs are made central to the arrangement. A simple glass of water is perhaps the most Paul Czitrom. Tetelcingo, Puebla. 1999. Mary Jane Gagnier de Mendoza Paul Czitrom. Tetelcingo, Puebla. 1999.</page><page sequence="12">indispensable offering on any Day of the Dead altar. As with the soul's first journey to the "other world/7 this too has been an arduous one, and the dead need to quench their thirst. Candles play an important symbolic role. Alejandrina Ríos, the daughter-in-law of Tia Antonia, believes that they illuminate the spirits' path on their return. "If you offer no candles then they light their little fingers to better see the rocks and thorns that line the dark road back/7 she says. Could this be why lit candles are also placed on the grave immediately following the burial and again on the Day of the Dead, times of travel in the spirit world? At three in the afternoon on November 1, as the church bells signal the spirits' ar rival, the living put the finishing touches on their altars. No hands remain idle at this time of year. Antonia's three daughters are busy in the kitchen. Reina pours a cup of hot chocolate whipped to a thick froth and nestles it among three large panes de muerto— sweet loaves of bread marked with a cross baked especially for this fiesta. Elia deftly mounds steaming tamales on a platter while Altagracia ladles the ubiquitous black mole over a cooked turkey leg. All this takes place under the watchful eye of Antonia, who has strategically placed the hot chocolate, tama les and mole on her altar, anticipating by minutes the arrival of los muertitos. "But things were not always like this," 76 Félix Mendoza emphasizes, comfortably presiding over the long wooden table he has made himself, with his back to the wall and his gaze upon the doorway. This trim, handsome man in his late fifties, dashing with a well-groomed mustache and a thick head of hair, has, like others of his genera tion, seen more changes in half a century than any Zapotee ancestor since the arriv al of the Spaniards. Félix recalls, "I would work day and night to finish weaving a se rape before the Day of the Dead. I'd take it to sell in the Tlacalula market and there were times when I returned home with the un sold piece after an entire day sitting in the sun. We would be really desperate then! If I didn't sell the serape we would have noth ing to offer our dead—not mole, not turkey, not even chocolate! My only option would be to sell it to one of the wholesalers in the village who would pay us whatever they wanted in those days, sometimes only half the value of the weaving because they knew we had no other choice." Arnulfo Mendoza Ruiz, my husband and son of the deceased Emiliano, says that, in the early nineteen-fifties, before the first day of the dead that they celebrated as a married couple, Emiliano couldn't sell his only rug to cover the costs of the fiesta. But it was so important to place an offering for the departed that they went up into the hills with a mule to gather that deliciously perfumed flower that can only be found in the sierra near to Teotitlán. After loading up the animal, the couple went from town to town exchanging the freshly cut flowers for bread, com, and beans—acceptable offerings in those times of scarcity. The grand altar at Clara Ruiz's home now takes first place for its sheer abun dance. It entails a true balancing act us ing plates of apples, oranges and tamales. Around the edge of the altar a wall over half-a-meter high has been constructed of fanes de muerto reminiscent of fieldstone walls. This arrangement stands so high that the photographs making up Mendoza Ruiz family's saintly entourage—concealed within wooden niches and embraced by crepe paper flowers—are barely visible over the oven-browned bread. Despite being in her sixties, Clara glides gracefully from altar room to patio to kitch en, intent on properly looking after her guests. She miraculously appears serving bowls of scalding atole, hot chocolate and steaming tamales. After 1 p.m. they dis pense with the breakfast foods and switch to mole de castilla, her deceased husband's fa vorite dish. Aroma is to the spirits what taste is to the living, so the heady incense of copal resin and tiny scented wild flowers are es sential elements on any Teotitlán altar. The intense smells satiate the dead while the liv ing indulge in bowls of rich turkey mole and yellow tamales. The villagers often com ment that when they place the bread on the altar it weighs more than when they take it away, or how the food removed from the offering has no flavor. Don Marino Vázquez, a respected village elder, explains: "That happens because the dead feast on the spirit of the food, they take away its essence; that's why we don't eat it afterwards." "It isn't just food we offer the dead chil dren—we buy them presents too!" Antonia elaborates. Tiny sheep, turkeys and angels of sugar decorated with colored frosting are made especially for the altars of angelitos. Some families will add miniature objects to the al tars such as metates (grindstones) and torti lla presses for their daughters, and toy ham mers and hoes for their sons. "Every year we buy a brand new ten ate (woven basket), molcajete (mortar and pestle) and ¡arrito (clay jug). Sure we use them afterwards but they do take the gifts away—symbolically. We know that," An tonia explains, "because women who have gone to wash clothes in the river before the fiesta is over testify, in spite of their fright, to seeing the dead leading away their pack burros or carrying baskets under their arms and sacks over their shoulders loaded with the offered gifts." Don Marino explains that if the spirits like to drink mescal then a toast is made. The juez (judge or official mezcal sever) will first pour a shot and drizzle it in the form of the cross on the offering at the foot of the altar. A drink having been offered to the deceased, he will then pass out shots of mez cal to all the visitors at the table, in order of importance. THE RETURN TRIP Many villagers insist on "seeing off" their loved ones at the cemetery. Others, like Fé lix Mendoza and Antonia Ruiz never go to the cemetery on November 2. Félix explains "this would be like kicking someone out of the house. Some sprits leave slowly and oth ers get drunk and so the fiesta spills over to the third." At 3 p.m. on November 2, deafening ex plosions from firecrackers in the churchyard and homes signal to the entire populace, liv ing or dead, that it is time for the souls to think about their journey back. A visit to the cemetery on this same afternoon is a sight to behold: the graves dance with enormous bunches of oxblood, cock's comb and brilliant marigolds, dot</page><page sequence="13">ted with delicate calla lilies. Many families go to the cemetery bearing fruits, peanuts, bottles of mezcal and cases of beer. This is a time to clean the tombstones, some are even diligently scrubbed with soap and water. Candles are lit and long-winded toasts are made to the departing loved ones. At this time of year, the warm glow ing rays of the late afternoon sun heighten the intense tones of the flowers, and as one draws near the cemetery's tiny chapel the woeful chants of the alabanceros (members of Teotitlán's highly respected lay clergy) invite those present to indulge in the mo ment's sweet sorrow. The band plays emotive dirges and slow marches, the same sad songs played for the funeral processions that every villager has accompanied on countless occasions, escort ing close and extended family on their last and ultimate rite of passage—the journey we will all, one day, make to the "other side." Just as Sunday is dedicated to the Lord, every Monday in November belongs to the dead. For five weeks, Padre Rómulo—who attends to the spiritual needs of Teotitlán as well as four other nearby villages—will visit each community in turn, celebrat ing los responsos in the town cemetery. On the Monday designated for Teotitlán even those who stayed at home with the lan guishing souls on November 2 will likely visit the cemetery making a small donation to the priest for which he will recite indi vidual prayers at the graves of their departed ones. The exuberance of fresh flowers and the chanted prayers heighten the senses to take in every detail of this moment suspend ed in time and space, somewhere between Heaven and Earth. POSTHUMOUS ♦REVENGE* Recorded by Fernando Benitez As told by Manuel Zugaide All Saints7 Day is the most important day of the year for us Indians. This is the day when the dead come back. Dead children come at midday on October 31 and they leave at noon on November 1. The dead adults ar rive at that time and they leave at midnight on November 2. They are summoned by bells. The bells ring twenty-four hours without stopping, from noon on the last day of October until noon on the first day of November, and the bell ringers take turns throughout the day they are rung in a minor key for the dead children, and a major key for dead adults. The dead arrive and they smell the bread, tamales and fruit making up the of ferings, and they take away their essence. And we are always there eating with them. They don't need anything else. The essence is enough for them to last a whole year. People go from door to door praying. They are paid fifty centavos or a peso to mention the name of dead family members, and they and their helpers share in the food from the offering. In Cihualtepec they are also summoned with bells, but it isn't the same thing here. Take an example: I buried my mom in La Joya, but unfortunately we have to celebrate All Saint's here. We don't know if the dead can come here, if they know how to get to some in known place even though we're calling them with prayers and bells. Some still go to Old Ixcatlán or Old Soyaltepec. We also have the dead who were buried previously on this land. Besides, they're poor people who don't know how to get around outside their customary places. It's the old people and not the young ones who still talk to their dead in the cem eteries. They say, Tray to God so you will reach Glory soon." Others say, "Here I am suffering in the knowledge that I'm bound to die before long. We all travel the same road eventually." They just talk to them from above and say the dead hear them. Sorcerers visit the cemeteries so the dead can call whoever they're thinking of harm ing. Say that person has a bad dream: he gets stabbed, or falls off a cliff, or his house bums down, and if he has sex with a wom an after that dream, well he's done for: he's sure to get sick or even die if he doesn't go to a good medicine man. The medicine man is supposed to protect him against the sor cerer and talks to God, to ask for his health to be restored: "Lord Jesus Christ, you can't let some bad person cut short the life of an other human being just like that." Since we're talking about All Saints' Day I'm going to tell you a story. There was a man whose wife died so he remarried. He was broke and had to go away to work, so a few days before the Day of the Dead, he told his bride, "Look, do me a favor, every thing you're going to put on the altar for your dead relatives, just put the same there for my dead wife. Will you do as I ask?" "Yes," answered the woman. "Don't worry. I'll do as you ask." "When the dishes and fruit are taken to the altar, it's customary to say, 'This fruit is for you, Juana (assuming this was the name of the dead wife) or this chicken, or this cof fee'. Do you understand?" "Yes, Pafnucio, I think I understand." So, the new wife heated up a stone and when it was so red-hot it was giving off sparks, she took it to the altar saying, "Jua na, I'll put this stone here for you to eat." The husband returned that same night and on the way home found the dead woman crying and moaning. "Ay, ay," the poor dead woman cried. "I've burned my mouth!" When the man entered the house, he asked his wife, "What did you put on the al tar for my dead wife?" "Food and fruit, like you ordered." He went closer and then he saw the burnt altar. He understood that his wife had tricked him. As he was a peaceful man, he just gave her a good thrashing. Translated by Michelle Suderman. FIESTA OF CONTRASTS ♦THE ALTAR* A CREATIVE HORN OF PLENTY Marta Turok The penetrating smell and bright color are unmistakable. It is October, the harvest is almost done, and the marigold has arrived in the street markets, seeming to signal the approach of that time of the year when we remember those who have passed away. Stands begin to pop up, selling objects for the Day of the Dead. Here we find strips of otate (cane), copal, censers, clay candelabras, little chocolate or sugar skulls, and crepe pa per decorations... From the (mainly urban) collective con sciousness, the prototype of the Mexican who plays with death has emerged and, Opposite page: Ruth D. Lechuga. Tejorones Dance. Panixdahuaca, Oaxaca. 1980.

It is a figure that mocks death and treats it with irreverence. This image is juxtaposed against that of the indigenous communities, guardians of ritual, who carry out the cer emony with discretion and reverence. In these communities, the Day of the Dead celebrations are held by the family. They are private, but possess a collective, communal dimension. Like any ritual, they consist of several acts: the welcome and fare well of the spirits, the preparation and set ting up of the offering in the family altar, the decoration of the graves, the vigil in the cemetery, and religious services from the Catholic liturgy. In this ceremony, the fam ily's dead relatives as spirits. As they come from a world that is similar to that of the liv ing, they are received for a brief get-together and are sent off with music, food and gifts. There is no smell of death, nor any fear. In many places, the spirits of the dead are guided by the aroma of flower petals— preferably of marigolds—which lay a fra grant trail from the street to the shrine. The arrival of the dead is announced by a peal of bells, prayers, the burning of copal and the lighting of candles, just as setting off fireworks or another peal of bells bids them farewell. However, in places such as the Huasteca area of Hidalgo, the celebra tions continue until Carnival, when those spirits still at large are captured with ropes called micahuitl to return them to the un derworld. The ceremony is prepared in advance. First, the cemetery is cleaned, the tasks and chores generally being done on a communal basis. Next, families take charge of the deco ration of their particular graves, although the adornment of graves belonging to the anonymous dead or those who have lost their families are never forgotten. These people are remembered because they will still be missed in some part of the world. The grave decoration is followed by the vigil. This is the act of accompanying the IE dead all day or night, sometimes sharing food with them and often serenading them with their favorite songs or ritual masked dances. In this way, the devotion at the family shrine is replicated in the cemetery. Altars are located next to the traditional shrine to the saints or in the main recep tion room of the house. While they display great differences between regions, they share certain formal elements. A table or shelf covered with a tablecloth forms the basis of any shrine in Mexico. The tablecloth is preferably white and embroidered, although these have tended recently to be replaced by patterned plastic ones. In order to mark out the sacred space for the offering, one or more sugarcane, otate or carrizo (reed) arches are tied to the feet of the table. These are adorned with marigolds, palm leaves, cucha rilla (lemon grass), banana leaves, fresh fruit, dried chilies and bread. The most spectacu lar shrines are constructed in the form of a catafalque, using covered boxes or shelves to make them taller. The most outstanding works of this nature are those of the Nahua community in Mexico City and the Huaste ca region, the Purépecha of Michoacán and the Zapotees in the Oaxaca valley. Paper flowers and crepe paper decora tions are occasionally hung in front or behind the table. These accompany photographs of those family members who have passed away, which are generally placed between several vases. One or more censers may be placed on a new petate (palm mat) in front of the table. Garments or objects associated with the deceased may also be place on the altar; these may include a machete, a hat, a sash, children's toys and so forth. Traditional dishes to be offered to the dead are cooked between October 30 and November 1. It is common that all the clay dishes in which food is offered be new; these then become part of the everyday crockery. RITUAL OBJECTS Although produced and used expressly for the celebration, the objects associated with the cult of the dead can be considered exam ples of ritual craftsmanship. Many of them form part of the offering, whose ephemeral nature demonstrates the abundance of cre ativity that the annual transformation de mands. The syncretic nature of this celebra tion is palpable above all in the pieces that form part of an offering, although traditions that were part of the European rites of the sixteenth century can also be appreciated. These found an echo in pre-Hispanic cus toms, such as the act of offering gifts to the dead, visiting the cemeteries to share in the ephemeral return of the dead and the special treatment of deceased children. As regards the objects, it is interesting to note, for example, that there is a page in the Magliabecchiano Codex showing strings of paper with designs probably painted in ulli (gum oil). These are direct ancestors of the strings of perforated crepe paper decorations used to this day, which have pre-Hispanic, Chinese, and French influences. Nowadays, the manufacture of perforated crepe paper decorations is traditionally carried out in San Salvador Huixcolotla, Puebla, as well as Uruapan, Michoacán, and Tláhuac in the Federal Distria, although they are produced in may other areas in a less commercial way. In Metepec, state of Mexico and Santa Fe de la Laguna, Michoacán, candelabras and censers are made of black clay or with a black glaze. In Ocotlán, Oaxaca, these are made of baked clay, the figures adorn ing them being painted white and cobalt blue with earth and pigments. The censers are crowned with anthropomorphic figures whose upraised arms are linked, and candela bras have paste skulls affixed to the tube and base. These hark back to a pre-Hispanic piece found in Zaachila, Oaxaca: a three-legged ceremonial vessel in the Mixtee style. Lean ing against this orange clay work, we find a skeletal figure attributed to the god Mict lantecuhtli, whose head swivels on its neck and whose expression fluctuates between macabre and playful.

The censers from Huaquechula and Izúcar de Matamoros, Puebla, whose colors are achieved through the use of anilines, are made of baked clay with a white glaze. These have a cherub and two molded flowers on the rim, as do the candelabras, which also have a figure of St. Michael the Archangel. The candles bear a scaly design and elaborate figures of flow ers and leaves, or simple diagonally snaking colored ribbons. Amaranth mixed with tamale dough forms a paste called tzoalli, with which the Aztecs molded the figures of certain deities used in celebrations and ceremonies, some of which were linked with death. In colo nial times, this dough could possibly have been replaced by anthropomorphic figures made of wheat bread, or molded sugar faces, which have since become quite ubiquitous in Day of the Dead offerings. FROM RITE TO MYTH, POPULAR RECREATION TO ARTISTIC INSTALLATION On comparing Mexico City practices with rural indigenous traditions and even those of urban mestizo in the rest of the country, we realize that a new vision of the Day of the Dead has developed in the capital, and has extended to other cities within and be yond the borders of Mexico. José Guadalupe Posada obviously played an important role in this movement. In close association with the work of this engraver, we encounter the calavera, a macabre cartoon combined with witty literary satire, criticizing politicians and public figures. The ritual of living with the dead, in this context, tends to remove the element of the sacred. Another development worthy of consideration is that experienced by those communities—such as Mixquic in the Feder al District, or the island of Janitizio in Pátzc uaro, Michoacán—whose fervor is mixed with mass tourism. The inhabitants of such places have learned, little by little, that pre serving tradition is also good business. In the ambit of popular craft expression and the staging of offerings, we also find an explosive reinterpretation of semantics that turns the cult of death into the cult of spec tacle. We should acknowledge that, for the last few years, the urbanized image of death (that of skeletons, skulls, and certain offer ings) has tended to lose its ritual meaning in order to re-create itself. Ritual craft has become decorative folk art, to be collected and exhibited. Numerous craftsmen, such as the brothers Alfonso and Tiburcio Sote no of Metepec, state of México, the Linares family of Mexico City, Alfonso Castillo of Izúcar de Matamoros and Roberto Ruiz of Oaxaca and Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, have testified that they started to make figures of skulls due to the interest of buyers and agents in the 1950s and 1960s. At no time, however, did this compromise the creativ ity and enjoyment with which they create their works. The offering has also taken on new val ues: it has become a symbol far excellence for artists and the educational system. On the one hand, it occurs in artistic installations and performances, which are taken to mu seums and cultural centers in Mexico and other countries. On the other, it becomes a medium for reaffirming Mexican cultural values in schools, countering the Anglo-Sax on tradition of Halloween. The celebration of the Day of the Dead is unequivocal evi dence that we live in times of change. We are poised between the rite and the conver sion into myth of something that seeks to be defined as a national archetype. Translated by David Bevis. AGRICULTURAL FIESTA ♦ON SEEDS* AND DEATH Gabriela Olmos Ever since humanity's discovery of agriculture, there have been peoples whose religions as sociated death rituals with the fertility of the Earth. Mircea Eliade, in his Tratado de historia de las religiones, cites India;s commemoration of the dead that coincides with the harvest festival, as well as an ancient Nordic cult that associated death with the ceremony of vegetation. Mexico's Day of the Dead festivities can structurally be counted amongst these tradi tional rites that recognize the relationship between seeds and the dead, as they too take place on the eve of the harvest, just before the onset of winter, between September and October. Among other things, both share a similar physical location—by planting the seed, do we not desecrate the Earth, the dead's natural resting place? Furthermore, both are in a larval state, having proceeded from a living state, and they share an inter mediate existence in which life lies latent. Thus, in Mexican rural communities, the celebrations of November 1 and 2 contain vestiges that predate the arrival of Judeo Christian tradition, hinting at the splendor of the pre-Columbian civilizations. Deep within the Day of the Dead substrata lies evidence of a ceremony that springs from a time when agricultural rites linking death and the possibility of renewal were being bom. What does the arrival of the dead during these dates mean to Mexican cultures? Ac cording to Eliade, it is a sacred time, a time of ritual and prayer—which are our means of establishing a dialogue with the gods— the slate of human history is wiped clean to begin anew. However, re-creating the world can only be accomplished by repetition of the divine creation, which in the beginning separates order from chaos, followed by the establishment of a cosmic balance. This is what takes place during the festival. How does one enter sacred time without offending the gods? A ritual preparation is necessary, and Mexican communities begin a few days before the arrival of the dead by sprucing up and decorating the cemeteries, and preparing the offerings (what better way to compensate for the offense of hav ing penetrated into the space of the dead to plant seeds than by making them offerings of the fruits of those seeds?), while some communities include a ritual purification. In their study of the Chatino Indians of Oaxaca, anthropologists Miguel Bartolomé and Alicia Barabas describe how in Yolote pec, the All Souls' Day celebration begins with a novena starting a week before No vember 1, during which time the offering is prepared, altars dedicated to the Sun and the Moon are adorned so they will watch over the dead's safe return to Earth, people bathe in the river (perhaps as an act of purification) and a welcoming altar for the visitors is set up. These acts, along with some trips to the cemetery and other civic preparations, are called "caring for the days," and what bet ter reason to care for the days than to avoid annihilation? Especially if you take into ac count that the farmers are faced with the on set of winter, the death of the Earth. This is the ceremony that transcends the encounter of the living with the dead. The Sun and the Moon, perhaps overseeing this cosmic bal ance, are called into action by their altars. The ritual preparation is followed by a reenactment of the age-old battle. Accord ing to Eliade, the arrival of the dead repre sents the cosmic night. In the dark, things lose their shape, outlines are blurred, chaos reigns.

In many parts of Mexico—one of them the Huasteca region—masked dances are performed in which, within a universal ized context, the dancers might represent the soul of the ancestors. This is why they are referred to as viejos (the elders) or, as Ruth Lechuga prefers, huehues, given that Náhuatl contains more specific reference to the an cestors. Communication between the living and the dead denotes unbalance, opening the door to licentiousness and drunkenness, the inversion of order. Fernando Benitez, in his study of the Huichol Indians, quotes a source who affirms the world of the dead is a "reverse world.77 Another link to agricultural festivities can be traced here. The recreation of primal chaos by archaic civilizations is experienced as time out of time, orgiastic, tied into fer tility, like classical bacchanalias celebrating the grape harvest. Nietzsche characterized them as "signifying the redemption of the world and days of transfiguration.77 Eliade spoke of them as moments in which the un stoppable power of nature takes shape and humans become symbolically transformed into seeds; the recovery of a larval state that is ready to sprout. Perhaps the sexual allusions of the Huasteca7s huehue dances or the Tejorones dance in Yaitepec, Oaxaca, as related by Ruth D. Lechuga, are remnants of the orgiastic sense of the Day of the Dead festivities. Paul Czitrom. Tetelcingo, Puebla. 1999. The ritual terminates in the restoration of cosmic order with the divine action of separating light and darkness. The dead—for the most part—take their leave, thankful for the offerings. Some are offended for having been forgotten, and they vow to deny their blessings for the regeneration of the Earth to those who have offended them. An af front to the dead, in effect, dooms the com munity to an ultimate death. Linked as they are to a consciousness of collective fate, in ancient times this implied a total annihila tion of life. Then comes the repetition of the specific action for creation. In the Day of the Dead festivities in Acatlán, Puebla, this occurs in the final episode of the dance of the Tec uanes, when the tiger is killed. This is no generic tiger. It happens to be Tezcatlipoca, who stood for the nocturnal forces in the pre-Hispanic pantheon. In Los indios de Mexico, Benitez status that among the Chamela and Cora Indians, the change of mayordomo (steward of religious matters) in the respective communities is followed by the Day of the Dead ceremo nies. This occurs among the Chatinos as well, as documented by Miguel Bartolomé and Alicia Barabas. Eliade asserts that "any enthroning has the value of a re-creation or regeneration of the world,77 citing two examples that con firm the idea. Fiji Islanders refer to the in stallation of a new chief as "the recreation of the world,77 and the emperors of China created a new calendar upon acceding to power, thereby abolishing the old order so as to establish a new one. Cosmic equilibrium having been reestab lished, the world is now ready for life to be reborn. Once winter has passed, the seeds will be planted to live alongside the dead, who will procure that they germinate and bear fruit. Seen from this perspective, the Day of the Dead ceremony among native Mexican people is not—as is frequently and ignorandy claimed—a tribute to death, but rather a trib ute to death7s link to life, to the possibility for renewal. This continues to be palpable in the traditions of those places where the inhabit ants fear individual death to a lesser degree than the annihilation of the community. Ac cording to Phillipe Ariès, since the late Mid dle Ages, city dwellers have undergone an individualization of death. More and more, dying is a personal tragedy. "I die" has sub stituted yesteryears "we will all die,77 which can still be perceived in Mexico7s rural com munities. Perhaps this explains why the nervous laughter the Day of the Dead provokes among city-dwellers is replaced in the coun tryside by a sense of making community, of pardoning faults and sharing food—acts that usually follow the restoration of the new or der. The collective guarantees perpetuation, for after we die, our descendents remain. Translated by Harry Porter. Harry Porter. Paul Czitrom. Tetelcingo, Puebla. 1999.</page></plain_text>
