The results of two international marine pollution symposia held in 1979 were published.1,2 Topics included heavy metal pollution, radioactive materials, oil and related substances, pesticides, industrial and domestic pollution, environmental evaluation and management, biochemical, physiological, ge netic, and behavioral effects, pathobiology, and monitoring. Workshops were conducted2 that outlined current knowledge in the field and suggestions for future research. The results of the offshore ecological investigation of 1972? 1974, which studied the long-term effects of oil well drilling and production off Louisiana, were published with an inde pendent appraisal of the study.3 The general conclusion was that no long-term effects of oil drilling and production could be detected in this area and natural phenomena probably have a greater impact on the ecosystem than petroleum activity. June 1981 925</page><page sequence="2">Water Pollution PESTICIDES The U. S. Department of Commerce published three an notated bibliographies on the toxic effects of pesticides on non target organisms including marine species.4-6 Zeil and Ballsch miter7 discussed the global occurrence of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and polychlorocamphenes (toxaphene) in fish from pristine environments throughout the world. In a review of the effects of pollution on estuarine clams and snails, Menzel8 discussed the toxicity of pesticides to various mollusks. Williams and Duke9 provided an overview of the knowledge of the effects of chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphates, carbamates, and juvenile hormone mimics on crabs. High lighted were (1) the effect of Kepone on crabs in the James River and (2) the impact of mirex on estuarine crabs following its use to control fire ants in the southeastern U. S. Methods. A marine algal bioassay method suitable for con ducting short- and long-term studies on pesticides and indus trial wastes was described.10 Algae were grown in optically matched culture tubes that fit directly into a spectrophoto meter, allowing population density to be estimated by absor bance without removal of samples. Hamburger11 discussed the problems associated with the conduct of the bioaccumulation test required by Japanese legislation and made suggestions for improvement. Hemmer12 described a positive pressure proportional diluter that can be employed in toxicological studies of pesticide ef fects on estuarine organisms. A bioassay method developed for the screening of pyrethroids for contact toxicity against the wood-boring marine crustacean, Limnoria, was discussed.13 This method is suitable for use with insecticides with low water solubility. Stout and Beezhold14 described simple methods for extrac tion and clean-up of marine fish and fish product samples for chlorinated hydrocarbons. Yamagishi et al.15 discussed an electron capture gas Chromatographie technique for determin ing 1,3-Dichloro- and l,3,5-Trichloro-2-(4-nitrophenoxy) ben zine (NIP and CNP) in estuarine fish and shellfish. Acute effects. McLeese and Metcalfe16 found that the joint toxicity of mixtures of phosphamidon and methidathion to adult lobsters (Homarus americanus) was greater than ad ditive in tests with the combined 48-hr toxicity unit of the mixtures totaling 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 units. The largest mag nification factor for greater than additive toxicity occurred where phosphamidon and methidathion contributed to the to tal toxicity unit in a ratio 1:1:5 and was progressively smaller for ratios of 1:4:4 and 2:1. Hirayama and Tamanoi17 found that for Penaeus japonicus the 24-h TLm of MEP at 25?C decreased with larval devel opment from 1.9 mg/l at nauplius stage to 5.0 - 9.0 X 10~4 mg/l at post larval stage; for diazinon from over 20 mg/l at the nauplius stage to 2 - 5 X 10-2 mg/l at post larval stage. For Portunus trituberculatus, the 24-h TLm value also de creased with development, the megalop stage having the lowest values of 1.7 - 5.0 X 10-4 mg/l MEP and 4.0 - 15.0 X 10~3 mg/l diazinon. Diflubenzuron was not acutely toxic to shellfish and fish, but affected the survival rate of Artemia salina and the shrimp Palaemonetes varians when its concentration rose to its level of water solubility.18 Linden et al.19 determined the toxicity of 28 pesticide formulations to the bleak Alburnus alburnus and the harpacticoid Nitocra spinipes, two brackish water organisms. Rubinstein et al.20 used a multi-species exposure system to determine the effects of contaminated sediments on estuarine organisms and settling communities. Oyster shell growth on artificially prepared Kepone-contaminated sediment was sig nificantly inhibited at 10 and 1 mg/l Kepone, but no mortality was observed. After a 10-d exposure to 10 mg/l Kepone, 37% of the mysids had died. Substrate reworking by lugworms was completely inhibited at 10 mg/l Kepone although no mortality occurred. After 28 d at 10 mg/l, oysters had accumulated 1.2 mg/l and lugworms 1.1 mg/l. Of the microfauna harvested at 28 d representing 19 species from 4 phyla, polychaetes, the only group affected, were almost completely eliminated at 10 mg/l Kepone. When James River sediment containing Kepone was tested, it was found that mysid mortality was insignificant but oyster shell growth and lugworm reworking were signifi cantly inhibited. After a 28-d exposure, oysters contained 0.51 mg/l Kepone and lugworms 0.75 mg/l. Additional pesticide acute effects information is presented in Table l.21 22 Sublethal effects. Weis and Weis23 found that carbaryl and parathion induced cardiovascular abnormalities and develop mental arrest in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), whereas DDT and malathion had no effect up to 10 mg/l. DDT, mal athion, and carbaryl caused optic abnormalities in the Atlantic silver-side (Menidia menidia) at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/l. Sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) did not exhibit abnormalities with any insecticide, but malathion caused uncoordinated neuromuscular activity in newly hatched fry. Bookhout et al?4 observed differential survival of the mud crab, Rhithropanopeus harrisii, from hatching to first crab stage in 35-125 mg/l Kepone, whereas differential survival of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, over the same period of development, occurred in a range of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/l. Using developing estuarine macrobenthic communities, Ta gatz et al?5 found that significantly fewer chordates, mollusks, and annelids occurred in 819 mg/l of the drilling mud biocide SURFLO B33 than in the control. Average numbers of ani mals and species did not significantly decrease in the biocide ALDACIDE at 15 and 300 mg/l. The authors concluded that ALDACIDE, which contains paraformaldehyde, was less toxic than the SURFLO B33, which contains dichlorophenol and showed toxic characteristics similar to those of PCP. Cook et al?6 examined the effects of pesticides on the microfungal succession in estuarine microcosms. Resident fungi were suc ceeded by Fusarium in the carbaryl-treated microcosm; by a fungus in the P?nicillium chrysogenum series in the methyl parathion-treated microcosm; and by a fungus in the P?nicil lium canescens series in the pentachloro-phenol-treated mi crocosm. Metabolism. Ghiasuddin and Matsumura27 used DDT to inhibit the enzyme ecto-ATPase in the nerve cord of the walk ing leg of the American lobster Homarus americanus. DDT inhibited the maintenance of a proper concentration of surface Ca++ in the nerve membrane, which may contribute to the unstable and excited condition of DDT-poisoned axons. AChE activity of an isolated nerve cord of moribund pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum) was significantly depressed by exposure for 6 h to 1.3 mg/l methyl parathion.28 Methyl par aoxon did not depress AChE activity after exposure for 74 h 926 Journal WPCF, Volume 53, Number 6</page><page sequence="3">Water Pollution .? a CO E ?

WU et al found that the new degradable DDT analog EDO (2,2-bis-(p-ethoxyphenyl)-3,3-dimethyloxetane), exhibited potent, specific actions on the sodium channel of axons of the American lobster (Homarus americanus). Fate. The stability of toxaphene in estuarine sediment showed no significant degradation over 21 days.10 These results indicated that any microbial metabolism of toxaphene in es tuarine sediment that occurs does not reduce the total amount of chlorinated hydrocarbon present nor does it reduce the tox icity of toxaphene to the brine shrimp, Artemia salina. Harder et al?x found that toxaphene concentrations in rain fall over a South Carolina salt marsh on occasions during and immediately following the summer use season, exceeded by several times concentrations reported to have produced dam age to fish bone. The estimated aerial input of toxaphene to the 26 km2 estuary over a 4-month period was 1.2 kg. Wu et al?6 investigated the fate of atrazine in the micro surface water of the Rhode River estuary. In the bulk surface water Atrazine concentration varied from 0.003 to 0.19 mg/ 1 (mean = 0.04 m/1) and in microsurface water, from 0.01 to 0.59 mg/l (mean = 0.13 mg/l). Following discovery that the James River and estuary had been contaminated with Kepone, Huggett et al?3 determined that all trophic levels in the estuary contained Kepone, most being stored in fine-grained, organic-rich bed sediments and although Kepone-bound suspended material was transferred seaward, the bulk of this material accumulated in the turbidity maximum zone of the middle estuary. Davis et al?4 determined the fate and effects of Atrazine in a salt marsh ecosystem and in laboratory microecosystems. Although both the field and microecosystem tests confirmed the rapid disappearance of Atrazine from treated areas, there were significant differences and results between the two sys tems. Three months after Atrazine application to the marsh, the total herbicide remaining in the soil, cordgrass, snails, fid dler crabs, and horse mussels was less than 3% of that applied. Seventy days after Atrazine application to microecosystems, 50% had been removed in tidal water; 42% within the first 6 days. Drifmiyer et al?5 found that giant cordgrass Spartina syn osuroides detritus absorbed Kepone from contaminated brack ish water during decomposition. Kepone detritus concentra tions increased substantially with time. Detritus accumulation provided a means of entrance of Kepone into estuarine food webs. Duinker and Hillebrand36 quantified organochlorines in water, seston, bottom sediment, and interstitial water in the estuarine region of the Rhine-Meuse system and found that the amounts of pentachlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene in solution were smaller than in suspension. Dissolved concen trations were dominant for hexachlorocyclohexane isomers. During estuarine mixing, dissolved concentrations of all com pounds were found to be linearly related to salinity. Wade31 examined representative organophosphorus pesticides with re spect to transport to the marine environment and rates of degradation in seawater and showed that methyl parathion and parathion were unstable in seawater, both half-lives being dependent upon the physical, chemical, and biological con ditions present. Under low-nutrient growth conditions, the half-life of parathion at 27?C decreased from 90 (sterile con ditions) to 41 days. Under conditions of nutrient enrichment, June 1981 927</page><page sequence="4">Water Pollution parathion half-life was further reduced to 7 days. At 4?C the half-life of parathion in sterile seawater was approximately 1 year and that of methyl parathion was 188 days. At 27?C under nonsterile conditions, half-lives were 56 days and 22 days, respectively. Spain et al?* found that prior exposure of microbial pop ulations from different environments to pesticides can cause them to adapt to degrade the compounds more rapidly during subsequent exposures. Because biod?gradation rates in labo ratory systems can be affected by concentration and prior ex posure, adaptation must be considered when such systems are used to predict the fate of pesticides in the environment. Bioaccumulation. McLeese et al?9 observed low uptake and high excretion rate constants of fenitrothion by soft shell clams (Mya arenaria) and mussels (Mytilus edulis). The authors concluded that organophosphates do not accumulate to any appreciable extent in aquatic organisms. Lobsters (Homarus americanas) fed mussels contaminated with endrin concentrated the compound 0.41 times in the he pa topancreas and 0.001 times in the tail muscle after 2 weeks.40 Concentrations in both tissues significantly decreased during a 4-week depuration period. Mirex was accumulated by juvenile Atlantic salmon from both water and food.41 After 42 days, the fish had accumulated Mirex to the level of 75 ng/g. The bioconcentration factor observed after 96 hours was 8 884. Matsuo42 presented a the oretical treatment of the ecological magnification process in which bioaccumulation of chemicals in fish is caused by the total interactions at polar and nonpolar parts between com pounds and tissues in fish and water. The author stated that based on these calculations, the "phenomenon" of bioaccu mulation was easily visualized. Residues. No significant levels of polychlorinated naphtha lene (PCN) or DDT and related compounds were found in Severn Estuary sediments extracted by cylic steam distillation in hexane.43 Wang et al.44 reported that DDT levels in sedi ment samples of the St. Lucie estuary, Fla., ranged from 1.8 to 6.15 mg/l. No detectable DDT was found in water samples. DDT in sediment off the Turkish Coast ranged from 3 to 21 ng/g.45 Wade and Quinn46 found that chlordane and DDT concen trations in sediment cores from mid-Narragansett Bay de creased with depth and reached background levels at different depths. The authors concluded that the results reflected the fact that these anthropogenic materials recorded environmen tal conditions of the past. Puccett and Leoni47 reported that HCB was identified in only 16% of 1 976 Mediterranean seawater samples (0.002 to 0.01 mg/l) analyzed and in none of the sediment samples. Brugmann and Luckas48 detected an average of 0.14 mg/l of DDT/DDE in 36 East and North Atlantic Ocean surface water samples. Concentration variations were correlated with anthropomorphic influences. Information on biotic pesticide residues is provided in Table 2.49"58 RESIDUES AND RELATED TOPICS The amount of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn in crustaceans and fish was measured to determine whether or not they were being concentrated in the food chain.59'60 A transfer factor was cal culated according to: ^ ? _ concentration in the consumer Transfer factor =-:?:? concentration in the prey If the value obtained was less than one, it was assumed that there was no biomagnification. The transfer factor exceeded one only for Zn, indicating it was the only metal of the four that may be concentrated through a food chain.59,60 Zinc and iron were demonstrated histochemically to be cy toplasmic inclusions in the lysosomes of the mussel Mytilus edulis. It was suggested that this may be a method of detox ication of metalic ions in the species.61 Experimental data sug gested that metallathionine-like compounds may play a role in storage or detoxification of Cu, Zn, and Hg in diatoms.62 There was no evidence for the binding of Cd, Zn, and Cu to metallothionein-like proteins in the barnacle Semibalanus bal anoides.63 The uptake of methyl-mercury was rapid in the polychaete Glycera dibranchiata, which could be the result of the lipid solubility and possibly the role of the sulfhydryl groups.64 Lead concentrations in sediments were seven times higher in sediments that received flood control run-off than a portion of the wetlands in southern California that did not.65 The clean-up procedures for mercury-contaminated sediments in Minamata Bay were outlined.66 Sediments were removed and used as fill material for inner parts of the bay. After completion in about 10 years, the area will be covered with high-quality soil. The concentrations of heavy metals found in marine organ isms are presented in Table 3.6367-107 Data on the analysis of marine organisms for the presence of metals and other ele ments are presented according to the element, group of or ganisms, and geographical region. MICROBIOLOGY A proceedings was published for a symposium on aquatic microbial ecology.108 Papers included discussion of the effects of environmental stress on microorganisms; transformation of chemical pollutants; organic and heavy metal toxicity; micro biological testing under the Toxic Substance Control Act, in cluding a discussion of the utility of "indicator organisms" such as Aeromonas hydrophila as indicators of environmental disturbance. Colwell109 cautioned, however, that while micro organisms are useful indicators of alterations in the natural environment, the use of "indicator organisms" has limitations. It has been suggested that bacteriological analyses are more suitable than chemical methods for detecting certain types of pollution.110 An astm publication appeared that provided the available techniques for enumeration and activity determi nation of native aquatic bacteria, many of which are applicable to assessment of pollutants on estuarine and marine microbiol populations.111 Microorganisms as Pollutants. Information on the effects of environmental conditions on growth and survival of microor ganisms currently used as indicators of pollution is presented in Table 4. Sublethal stress in Escherichia coli was shown to increase with salinity in various detection media.112 Temper ature and pH were found to have the greatest effect on re covery of fecal indicator bacteria.113 Hussong et al.U3 found 928 Journal WPCF, Volume 53, Number 6</page><page sequence="5">Water Pollution Table 2?Pesticide residues: biota Compound Species Location Residues Reference Aldrin

In natural aquatic systems, survival of enteric bacteria was shown to be controlled by such mechanisms as protozoan pr?dation115 and attachment to sediments.116 In the latter, organic content appeared to be a determining factor in survival. Microbiological monitoring of nearshore waters has dem onstrated the need for improved wastewater treatment in sev eral coastal cities.117118 Likewise, detection of coprostanol, a microbiological degradation product of cholesterol excreted in mammalian feces, demonstrated serious wastewater pollution in one region of the harbor of Mazatlan, Mexico.119 Bacterial disease. Microbiological monitoring of commercial seafoods continued to reveal the presence of Vibrio parahae molyticus.120 Larval oysters infected with several marine Vib rio spp. demonstrated decreased growth and/or high mortal ity.121 One bacterial isolate attached to the larval shell and destroyed mantle tissue. The extent of severity of fin rot in Atlantic salmon was shown to be a function of temperature.122 The etiological agent appeared to be either a Flexibacter sp. 932 Journal WPCF, Volume 53, Number 6</page><page sequence="9">_Water Pollution or Aeromonas salmonicida depending on the hatchery. A new plate-count agar was developed for enumeration of aerobic, heterotrophic bacteria in estuarine waters, sediments and shellfish.123 Viruses. Progress continues to be made in the evaluation of viral contamination in estuarine and coastal waters. Metcalf et al?24 proposed an improved method and test strategy for recovery of enteric viruses from shellfish. Kapuscinski and Mitchell125 reviewed processes controlling virus inactivation in coastal waters. They concluded that biological and chemical inactivation were most important. Virus adsorption to sedi ment greatly increased survival time.126 This survival mech anism seemed to only function at high (37?C) temperatures for poliovirus.127 It was demonstrated that enterovirus uptake by the soft-shelled clam, Mya arenaria, was enhanced when viruses were associated with particles.128 Virus elimination occurred within a 24 to 48-h depuration. Correspondingly, LaBelle, et al?29 found greater numbers of viruses in sediments than in overlying water. After examining a number of param eters, the only significant association was a positive correlation between viruses and total fecal coliforms in the sediment. Comparison between waters open and closed to shell-fishing revealed very little difference in viral quality.130 While viruses were frequently isolated from treated wastewater effluents, very few were ever detected in receiving surface waters in Oyster Bay, N. Y. While the presence of virucidal agents in estuarine and marine waters has been recognized for some time, their identity has been elusive. Heavy metals125 and microbial agents131 have been suggested as possible sources of virucidal activity. Survival of simian rotavirus, which exhibited stability in natural waters similar to enteroviruses, was af fected by a non-seasonal change in water quality.132 Pollutant-microbe interactions. The surface microlayer of a salt marsh in San Francisco Bay was found to contain ele vated concentrations of particulates, microorganisms, and lead.133 The investigators suggested that microlayer particulate surfaces may act as a site for uptake of lead into marine bio mass. Aerosols of marine origin formed from surface micro layers may therefore present a health hazard to populations inhabiting small islands.134 High levels of Cu, Pb, and Zn caused local inhibition of bacterial heterotrophic processes and loss of viability in a slough of an industrialized estuary receiving metal finishing wastes.135 Bacteria and metals did not generally influence each other in other areas of the estuary. In laboratory experiments, viable counts of various physiological groups of bacteria cul tured in lead-contaminated artificial seawater were not sig nificantly different from those cultured without lead enrich ment. Lead tolerance was lost, however, when bacteria were cultured in a medium without lead.136 Microorganisms isolated from sediments of the New York Bight apex that were resistant to cadmium were also found to exhibit drug-resistance.137 Another study further demon strated that drug-resistance could be transferred between strains of E. coli in sediments of the New York Bight con taminated with wastewater sludge.138 The capacity of sediment microbes to modify the state in which metals exist was dem onstrated.139 Several reports accessed the relationship between concen trations of oil-degrading bacteria and the degree of oil pol lution in marine waters.140"142 Petroleum products and brine discharge from off-shore drilling platforms did not seem to be toxic to marine bacteria.141 Likewise, the utilization of glucose by marine and estuarine bacterial populations was usually not affected by the presence of crude oil.143 Microbial degradation of selected hydrocarbons was as sessed in relation to sediment conditions.143-145 Oxygen con centration, oxidation-reduction potential, and pH were found to be important factors. Enclosed ecosystems were used to examine various aspects of hydrocarbon degradation in sea water.146147 In one of the studies, 230 days were required to oxidize 29 percent of the initial quantity of benzanthracene present to C02.147 Understanding of the pathways of mono and bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were described for an Arthrobacter sp. isolated from seawater.148 As lists of toxic substances expand, new studies demonstrate the capacity of estuarine and marine microbial populations to tolerate and transform previously untested compounds.149150 A topic that has received increased attention is the chemical consequences of microbially mediated degradation of the nu merous organic pollutants which find their way into estuarine and marine systems.151,152 The impact of pollution on the uti lization and mineralization of important inorganic nutrients such as N, S, and P by microorganisms has also been examined in coastal waters.153154 A list of references relating to microbe pollutant interactions is presented in Table 5. Several studies have applied techniques combining both microbiological and chemical analyses for impact studies. Alexander and Boethling155 developed a sensitive method for measuring biod?gradation of organic chemicals based on the formation of 14C02 from 14C-labelled compounds. Using this technique they found that biod?gradation rates at low sub strate concentrations were well below those predicted by Mi chaelis-Menten kinetic relationships. Kennicut156 proposed measuring ATP concentration, a measure of living biomass, as a fast and reliable indicator of toxicity. Surveys. Word162 sampled soft-bottom benthic communities in deeper water of the southern California Bight, which en abled extension of the Infaunal Trophic Index (ITI) to depths ranging from 20 to 800 m. Natural communities at deep sites distant from major sources of organic pollutants were domi nated by suspension-feeding taxa and had ITI values greater than 83. Additional analyses of deepwater stations resulted in a list of 53 invertebrate taxa (compared with 46 taxa used previously) which could be separated into 4 infaunal trophic index feeding groups.163 Criteria for trophic group assignments were presented in addition to specific examples and descrip tions of feeding behavior. Evaluation of the effects of repli cation of the ITI indicated that a single 0.1 m2 sample was adequate to characterize benthic communities within a range of 5 ITI units at the 95% confidence level.164 Bellan165 proposed an Annelid Index of Pollution for rocky substrate polychaete communities, based on the ratio of the sums of percent oc currences of pollution indicator species (for example, Platy nereis dumerili, Dorvillea rudolphi or Theostoma oerstedi) to the sums of percent occurrences of "pure water" species (for example, Syllis spp. or Amphiglena mediterr?nea). In an extensive field study on the French Mediterranean coast, the index was well correlated with the Shannon-Weaver diversity index and allowed for discrimination of samples from heavily June 1981 933</page><page sequence="10">Water Pollution Table 3?Chemical residues reported from marine organisms.

Alternatively, the relative abundances of Hyale spp., Caprella liparotensis and Elasmopus pocillimanus declined considerably as the degree of pollutant stress increased. The introduced enchytraeid oli gochaete, Lumbricillus lineatus, was dominant within 1.5 km of a pulp mill waste outfall in British Columbia.167 The per centage of total adult enchytraeids represented by L. lineatus was proposed as an index of pollutant impact, because a diverse enchytraeid assemblage without L. lineatus was observed at undisturbed intertidal sites. At a wastewater outfall in lower Chesapeake Bay, densities of living foraminifers increased with distance from the out fall.168 A station in the immediate outfall vicinity had a sig nificantly different foraminiferal population than sites 100 to 300 m from the outfall. The outfall station had the lowest number of species, but species diversity (H') and equitability (E) were higher because of the lack of dominance by one or two species. The soft-bottom benthic community near a waste water outfall in Victoria, Australia, was composed of poly chaetes and crustaceans and was dominated by suspension and deposit feeders.169 Species diversity (H'), evenness (J), and number of species at sites 500 to 1 900 m from the outfall were comparable to those at nearby sites with similar sediment characteristics although nearshore organic enrichment may cause some stimulation of spionid polychaetes and the ghost shrimp, Callinassa cer?mica. Effects of phosphate-rich water from Port Phillip Bay were detectable for approximately 28 km offshore of the Victoria Coast.170 Benthic community pa rameters in the Belfast Lough varied with distance from Bel fast, which was the primary source of municipal and industrial wastes into this estuarine system.171 The gross pollution effects, as evidenced by high oligochaete densities and low numbers of amphipods, were confined primarily to dock areas near Belfast. Andrews and Rickard172 reported a secondary phase of biological recovery of the inner Thames estuary following improved effluent quality at a large municipal waste treatment facility. The initial recolonization after 1964 followed estab lishment of aerobic conditions during the summer. The second phase (1974-80) was characterized by increased numbers of species of invertebrates and fishes with reproduction of both groups occurring in the estuary. A study of phytoplankton in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, which receives wastewater discharge, indicated that nitrogen was a limiting factor in all areas of the bay.173 However, phosphorus was simultaneously limiting in the more oligotrophic areas farthest from wastewater outfalls. Because of high uptake of the inorganic nutrients in the en riched embayment, particulate concentrations such as chlo rophyll a and ATP were suggested as more sensitive indices of eutrophication. Hannah and Boney174 compared the con tribution of nonoplankton (&lt;20 urn) to the total phytoplankton biomass and carbon fixation in two neighboring sea lochs re ceiving different wastewater loads. In the more heavily loaded Gareloch, the contribution of nanoplankton to both parameters increased markedly following thermal stratification, while the relative amount of nanoplankton remained constant in Loch Long. Effluent from a titanium-dioxide factory resulted in de creases in intertidal and benthic fauna near the discharge; however, gross ecological changes have apparently not oc curred.175 Large-scale discharge of industrial and municipal effluents in combination with inadequate tidal flushing ap parently caused nutrient enrichment of Visakhapatnam Har bor, India.176 Phytoplankton blooms were dominated by Ske letonema costatum. Analysis of intertidal macroalgal assemblages on the southern California coast by reciprocal averaging ordination indicated a distinct latitudinal gradient south of Point Conception.177 However, the gradient was not strictly latitudinal and factors such as water temperature, sand movement, human disturbance, and wave action were sug gested as being responsible for deviations near the Ventura Port Hueneme and north Los Angeles areas. Frequent anoxia of bottom waters in areas of high phytoplankton productivity in a Danish fjord occasionally resulted in mass mortalities of benthic organisms and also affected benthic community com position.178 Past studies have indicated the common occurrence of float ing plastic material in coastal areas throughout the world. Based on neuston samples collected from the South Atlantic Ocean, Morris179 reported that polyethylene and polypropylene pellets, together with tar balls, were the most common floating contaminants (1000-2 000 particles/km2). A count in the Eastern Mediterranean180 indicated that the average density of large particles (&gt;1.5 cm) was approximately 2 000/km2 and plastic was the most commonly observed material. Effects of dredging and harbor construction were studied in several habitats. Following dredging and blasting in a Cen tral Indian Ocean atoll lagoon, species richness of coral fauna was high and was comparable to nearby unaltered lagoons.181 Swartz et a/.182 reported that richness and density of macro bent hie species declined 52% and 20%, respectively, following initial dredging at Yaquina Bay, Oregon. During early stages of recovery, a dominance of opportunistic species was observed, associated with adult immigration of the amphipod Aniso gammarus pugettensis and larval recruitment of the poly chaete Armandia brevis. About 1 year was required for full recovery of benthic communities to pre-dredging conditions. Potential effects of large-scale sand dredging in the North Sea were assessed by de Groot.183 Effects were predicted for plank ton, bottom fauna, and fish with full recovery requiring about 3 years. COMPLEX EFFLUENTS AND ENVIRONMENTS Papers focused on toxicity of contaminants to marine and estuarine animals are summarized in Table 6. W. H. Thomas and coworkers184-186 studied the effects of a mixture of 11 heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Ge, Sb, and Se) on phytoplankton growth in a natural assemblage of dia toms and dinoflagellates from Saanich Inlet, B. C, Canada, and in laboratory cultures of the diatom Thalassiosira aes tivalis. Morphological effects of the individual metals on the laboratory cultures of T. aestivalis were compared and found to be divided into three groups according to toxic effects: Cu, Zn, Ge; Hg, Cd, Pb; and Cr, Ni, Se, Sb, and As. Similarity of morphological effects caused by Cu, Zn, and Ge suggested similar biochemical pathways of Si metabolism were affected. The toxicity of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb to the diatom Ditylum brightwelli decreased as EDTA concentration was increased, whereas increased levels of EDTA had no effect on Hg, Ag and Ti toxicity.187 Kaiser188 predicted the levels of metals that 936 Journal WPCF, Volume 53, Number 6</page><page sequence="13">Water Pollution Table 6?The effects of trace contaminants on marine organisms.

Eggs of Baltic herring were incubated in seawater contain ing mixtures of Cd, Cu, and Pb. Negative effects of the metals on embryonic survival and viable hatch were additive in the case of Cu and Cd, but Pb did not exert detrimental effects.189 The crustacean, Crangon crangon was exposed to three metals, Cd, Cu, and Zn, at 0.35, 1.6 and 14.4 mg/l, respectively. Moult-stage-dependent mortality was not observed for Cd, but in Cu and Zn the post-moult stages were more susceptible than the pre-moult or inter-moult stages.190 Uptake and regeneration of nitrogen, and the effects of low concentrations of Cu, were investigated in Controlled Exper imental Ecosystems (CEEs). In copper-treated CEEs, the amount of particulate nitrogen settling through the water col umn was substantially less than the controls because of a de cline in Zooplankton grazing in the presence of copper.191 Roes ijadi192 exposed the clam Protothaca staminea to Cu concentrations of 0.007 to 0.082 mg/l for 30 days and found these concentrations were stressful with the gills being the primary organs of concentration. The regulation of Na and K by the clam was disrupted at 0.039 mg/I, and a sublethal cytotoxic response was evident at lower concentrations. The effect of sublethal additions of mercuric chloride on the diatom Skeletonema costatum grown in NH4-limited che mostats and batch cultures was assessed by Cloutier-Mantha and Harrison.193 Ammonium-limited diatom cultures were substantially more sensitive to mercuric chlorides than non ammonium-limited cultures, implying that Hg pollution may seriously decrease the ability of a species to utilize a limiting nutrient during periods of seasonal limitation. In another Hg experiment, burrowing behavior of Corophium volutator was recorded in sediments treated with seawater solutions of 0.001 to 1 000 mg/l HgCl2. C. volutator avoided treated sediments (0.001 to 0.1 mg/l) even through bacterial food was still avail able in the sediments.194 In experiments with complex effluents and seawater chlo rination, Roberts195 found the 96-h LC50 for the spot Leios tomas xanthurus to be 0.23 and 0.25 mg/l for chlorinated and bromochlorinated treated wastewater, respectively. Crabs, Cancer product us, exposed to chlorinated seawater showed alterations in haemolymph Na and Mg concentrations because of changes in bladder wall activity.196 Oshida and Goochey197 tested sea urchin fertilization and larval development in dilute seawater solutions of three south ern California effluents and found all to be toxic at about 1 to 20% effluent in seawater. Bougis et al?9* have proposed using sea urchin larvae to assess seawater quality. Effects of secondary waste effluents from textile manufac turing plants were determined on Skeletonema costatum, Pa laemonetes pugio and Cyprinodon variegatus.

The adults or both species were tolerant to the effluent but growth rates were retarded.200 Ragar et al.20X examined growth responses of several species of phytoplankton, cultured with and without metal stress, to supplements of brown algal polyphenols. The polyphenols sig nificantly increased the ability of the phytoplankton to grow by detoxifying some of the zinc. Polyphenols from brown algae may contribute to the natural chelating capacity of inshore seawater. Cantelmo et al.202 studied the effects of barite, a major constituent of drilling muds used in marine oil drilling oper ations, on meiofauna in an experimental flow-through system. Boney203 found that iron ore dust decreased the attractant ability of algae, Fucus serratus, oosph?res for spermatozoids. Chungue et al.204 examined the toxic effects of various algae. Fifteen strains of algae were cultured in an artificial medium and most were found to be non-toxic to mice. OIL POLLUTION Impacts of the petroleum industry on marine ecosystems was reviewed from several viewpoints including world input to the oceans212 and French coast213, biotransformation214, oil spill technology215 221, hydrocarbon characterization222, toxic ity223, blowouts224, and liability.225 Analytical Methods. A series of petroleum hydrocarbons of geochemical significance, for example C2o-C4o acyclic isopren oids and C27+ steranes and triterpanes, were proposed as pas sive tags for the characterization of oils in the marine envi ronment.226 Anderson et al.221 documented procedures which gave marked improvement in the identification of spilled light fuel oils by infrared spectroscopy. Methyl-to-methylene carbon and methylene-to-methine ratios were proposed as main in dices of oil biod?gradation as studied by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.228 Intralaboratory precision in gas Chromatographie determination of hydrocarbons in mussels was determined to be ?40%.229 Among commercially avail able enzyme preparations, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogen aoe served as the best indicator of refinery effluent toxicity.230 Papers concerned specifically with polycyclic aromatic hy drocarbon analysis were reviewed.231"232 Two papers described the analysis of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons from sed iments.233234 A technique for the analysis of bioassay waters for benzo(a)pyrene in the 0.2 /?g/1 to 200 ??g/1 range was developed.235 The application of high pressure liquid chro matography for the analysis of hydroxylated benzo(a)pyrene metabolites in marine fish was presented.236 The analysis of polymethyl-naphthalene and -phenonthrene in marine tissues by mass fragmentography was detailed.237 Residues?Water and Sediment. Seawater samples from the Sargasson Sea, western equatorial Atlantic, and the upwelling region off Peru contained pentadecane, C2-alkylated benzenes, and other hydrocarbons at levels between 2 to 60 ng/kg.238"239 Levels of non-volatile hydrocarbons in seawater off Australia varied from less than 0.1 /?g/1 to over 22 /?g/1 with highest concentrations found close to shore-based imputs such as oil refineries.240 Open-ocean, non-polluted Gulf of Mexico surface waters were marked by C6-Ch hydrocarbon concentrations around 60 ng/1, while those from the Caribbean contained about 30 ng/1.241 Petroleum hydrocarbons averaged from 6.9 to 25.8 ug/1 at 1-m depths from the Alboran Sea and Libyan coastal regions of the Mediterranean.242 Similar levels at depths down to 10 m were reported from northern Indian Ocean waters.243 A possible direct contribution of phytoplank ton to hydrocarbons in seawater was inferred from Mediter ranean Sea data by Goutz and Saliot.244 The presence of pe lagic tar was documented.245"247 Results of a 4-month study on the weathering of an Arabian light crude confirmed field observations of relative increases in asphaltenes and resins during the degradative time period.248 Age-dated sediment cores from opposite shores of the U. S. confirmed a decrease in petroleum and synthetic hydro carbon levels as deeper sediments were analyzed.249 Hydro carbons in sediments were analyzed from numerous parts of the world at various depths.250-252 Residues?Biota. Alkane profiles for 48 bottom-dwelling organisms from an oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico revealed that only a small proportion of the mollusks studied contained pe troleum hydrocarbons.253 Benzo(a)pyrene concentrations in oysters from a Texas bay ranged from 0.07 to 0.14 ng/g or several orders of magnitude lower than those reported in 1972.254 Dispersants. Chemical demulsification of residual oils in seawater was modeled using aerosol or aerosol+polyethylene oxide combinations.225 The performance of a novel "anti mousse" additive was documented following laboratory and semi-technical scale testing.256"257 Dispersion and weathering of treated and untreated research spills were studied in the waters of New Jersey.258 The toxicity of petroleum solidifying agents to a marine diatom and fish was on the order of several g/1.259 An ubiquitous interstitial marine oligochaete proved "pollution-tolerant" in tests with an Arabian crude and new and old-generation dispersants.260 Field Studies. Oil and intertidal sediments were investigated for changes during the year following the Amoco Cadiz spill for changes resulting from evaporation and degradation.261 Studies of effects in biological systems included mollusk de velopment,262 changes in meiofauna diversity,263 distribution of platyhelminthes,264 community structure of Zostera beds,265 and the occurrence of marine yeasts in degraded oil.266 Other catastrophic spills received interest through studies in the chemical similarities of oil weathering after release from offshore oil rigs,267 population structure of littoral algae and invertebrates following the Betelgeuse explosion,268 and zoo plankton biomass distribution after the Isesis oil spill.269 The chemical fate and intertidal biological consequences of the Eleni K spill were documented by Blackman and Law.270 Re search surrounding the Florida release off Falmouth harbor was detailed by Sanders et al?lx Documentation of inputs and effects of chronic oil release was made for diverse geographic areas including the Persian Gulf,272 North Sea,273 Coal Oil Point, California,274 the benthos surrounding a deep-water production platform in the Gulf of Mexico,275 and South African sandy beaches.276 An exami nation of the effects of weathered and unweathered Louisiana crude oil experimentally spilled into Virginia estuaries was conducted by Bender et al?11 Techniques for the evaluation of small gasoline spills, utilizing samples and bivalve mollusks, were detailed.278 June 1981 939</page><page sequence="16">Water Pollution Bioaccumulation. Research on the bioaccumulation of pe troleum hydrocarbons was chronicled wherein clams were exposed to mixtures of hydrocarbons, usually as whole oil or derivatives.279281 Eight months after the Amoco Cadiz wreck, hydrocarbons accumulated in biogenic lipid-rich tissues of in vertebrates and eels had been depurated to varying degrees.282 Experimental studies of oil ingestion by eels were also re ported.283"284 Natural marine sediments were shown to accu mulate significant levels of oil via suspended particulate set tlement.285 The marine diatom Cyclotella preferentially accumulated C-16 from a water and oil mixture.286 Accumulation kinetics were reported for specific aromatic hydrocarbons and marine organisms, such as the monoaro matic benzene and a rotifer.287 The uptake of a diaromatic, naphthalene, by the polychaete Ar en?cola was described.288 Palmork and Solbakken289 29? showed that lobsters eliminated most accumulated phenanthrenes within a few weeks following a single dose and that maximal levels of hydrocarbon and metabolites in the liver of cartilaginous fishes occurred several days later than corresponding values in bony fish. Dimethynaphtholene induced increases in the activity of microsonal NADPH neotetrazolium reduc?ase in blood cells of Mytilus edulis?91 The same species was able to metabolize 1-(1-1+C) napthol into 1-naphthylsulfate.292 Anthracene caused damage to lysomes of Mytilus pericardial epithelium cells, implicating disruption of excretory processes involving blood purification.293 Little differences in benzo(a)pyrene metabo lism potential was noted between male and female skates.294 Inhibition of oryl hydrocarbon hydroxylose in the gut of blue crabs by low concentrations of 7,8-naphtho-flavone and lack of induction by hydrocarbon-laced food suggested important differences between crab systems and those of other animals.295 Toxicity and Sublethal Effects. Emulsed oil collected some distance from the Ixtoc I runaway well was not acutely toxic to juvenile amphipods and Zooplankton in the laboratory.296 The acute toxicity of a fuel oil, wicking agent, and lighter fluid to an alga, copepod, and fish was reported.297 Dibenzothio phene and 3,4-benzopyrene had no effect on the hatchability of Artemia eggs at levels up to 10 mg/l.298 Through studies on burrowing rate, respiration and growth suppression, it was concluded by Stekoll et al.,299 that Ma coma balthica would suffer population decreases when chron ically exposed to oil-in-seawater concentrations exceeding 0.03 mg/l. Decreased spleen weight and increased hematocrit in females were the major effects resulting from exposure of fish to surface slicks for 2 weeks.300 Petroleum hydrocarbons did not disrupt the intestinal mucosa cells of juvenile salmon at levels where PCBs were disruptive.301 North Sea crude oil and several dispersants greatly increased the number of lysosomes in apical surfaces of gill cells from a gastropod.302 Naphtholene proved more inhibitory than benzene to photosynthesis in macroalgae.303 Higher doses of No. 2 fuel oil produced dose response relationships for plasma corticosteroid, glucose and cholesterol levels in juvenile mullet.304 Three studies charac terized effects of petroleum hydrocarbons on osmotic physi ology of mud crabs,305 polychaetes,306 and mummichog.307 Several papers described the disruption of growth and re production processes in marine organisms by petroleum hy drocarbons, primarily in the form of exposures to crude oils, including reduction of copepod brood size,308 arrest of mussel growth at the hinged larvae stage,309 modification of growth and pr?dation rates for the oyster drill,310 inhibition of sexual chemotoxis in Fucus spermatozoids,311 mitochondrial swelling in herring embryonic muscle cells,312 growth reduction in five phytoplankters313 and growth inhibition in crab larvae.314-315 Seasonal changes in effects of dispersant and fuel oil combi nations on fin regeration were noted by Fingermann.316 Be havioral work included quantitation of feeding rate disruption in Acartia copepod species and the determination of a thresh old concentration of 10~7 mg/l for naphthalene in blue crab.318 Aves. Based on release and rehabilitation rates for a South African program, Randall et a/.,319 recommended attempting to clean and rehabilitate penguins after accidental oiling. Guidelines for evaluating effects of ingested oil on nesting seabirds were given. 32? McKelvey et al.,32X called attention to the greater loss of seabirds around Vancouver harbor resulting from chronic vegetable-oil pollution as opposed to petroleum oil pollution. In Arctic and sub-Arctic areas, light oilings can lead to avian mortality when oil effects synergistically combine with stresses imposed by severe climate.322 Methods for the analysis of 16 hydrocarbons in avian tissue were detailed.323 Incubation behavior of female ducks exposed to Prudhoe Bay crude oil (100 mg/m2) was unaffected as was survival of first-week ducklings.324 Effects of fresh and weathered crude oil hatchability of mallard, heron, and gull eggs were re ported.325326 Diseases and Abnormalities. Diseased populations of fish were reported in Massachusetts, New York, Southern Cali fornia, South Africa, France, Tunisia and Japan,327"328 Puget Sound,329 the German Bight,330 the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, and Northeast Pacific Ocean.330 Peters and Watermann330 recognized three types of skin tumors in near-shore marine fish: infectious "fish pox"-like tumors affecting up to 6.6% of Atlantic dab (Limando limando) possibly related to sulfuric acid and titanium contamination in the German Bight; lip papillomas caused by direct mechanical abrasion in many captive fish; and epidermal papillomas in pleuronectid flatfish of the North Pacific that may be caused by a virus and may be pollution related. However, Dawe et al., concluded these latter types of tumors were caused by an amoeba; these authors and Hard et al. agreed they are not neoplastic, as once presumed. Hepatomas (liver tumors) and several pre-cancerous liver lesions have been reported in 25% of Atlantic tomcod (Mi crogadus tomcod) from the Hudson River estuary333 and lower frequencies in several species of demersal fish in contaminated waterways of Puget Sound, Washington.329 The Hudson River hepatocellular carcinomas are associated with fish containing PCBs in the range of 10 to 90 /*g/l. Several distinct types of liver lesions in Puget Sound flatfish occurred in fish contam inated with PCBs, chlorinated pesticides, chlorinated buta dienes and petroleum hydrocarbons; however, the causes of these disorders have yet to be confirmed. Mutagenic chemicals were also detected in British mussels.335 Malins et al.329 also reported a variety of lesions in shrimp and crabs taken from contaminated waterways of Puget Sound while another disease was characterized for shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico.336 Zinc was found to accelerate regenerative growth of cut fins in Fundulus exposed to methyl mercury; in the absence of zinc, methyl mercury inhibited regenera tion.337 Sludge, Dredging, Ocean Dumping, and Recovery. The com position, fate and effects of waste activated sludge disposal by 940 Journal WPCF, Volume 53, Number 6</page><page sequence="17">Water Pollution the City of Los Angeles into Santa Monica Bay was reviewed and brought up to date with new samplings.328 About 10% of sludge discharged to date remained on the sea bottom covering an area of 3 km2 of sea bottom or 0.4% of the Bay. Densities of bottom fish, crustaceans and infauna were increased at the site while diversity of infauna was depressed. Several trace elements were elevated in invertebrates but were not bio magnified through the food web. In contrast, PCBs were el evated in sediments, fish and shellfish, but most organisms met the FDA standard. Sludge dumping in the New York Bight has elevated levels of PCBs in adjacent sediments, but con tamination was limited to the dump site, and dated core pro files showed good agreement with initiation of production and use.337 However, the presence of coprostanol, a fecal steroid, indicated sediments of the New York Bight are probably more widely contaminated with barge-dumped wastewater sludge.342 Wastewater sludge disposal in tropical mangroves resulted to accumulation of Cd, Cu, Cr, Zn, Ni, and Pb in turtle grass.343 Swan344 reported on NOAA studies on the distribution, fate and effects of pharmaceutical sludges dumped at sea over the Puerto Rico Trench. Atlas et al.}45 reported that a biological sludge dumped by a chemical company at a dumpsite in the Gulf of Mexico contained over 100 organic compounds and metals. Phytoplankton growth was enhanced slightly but did not lead to other measurable effects, such as occurrence of chemical residues or decreased transparency 24 hours after dumping. At a 2 800-m deep Atlantic dumpsite, canister-con tained radio-cesium (137Cs) leaked into adjacent water and sediments.346 Observed 137Cs concentrations in sediments were several orders of magnitude above background and biotur bation seemed to be the dominant mechanism for dispersal. Recovery of macrobenthic communities began about 6 months after dredging a section of Intracoastal Waterway in South Carolina; to minimize adverse effects the authors rec ommended dredging in late fall/early winter, dredging more frequently and disposing at several sites.347 Brannon and Plumb348 reported no long-term beaching problems would be associated with disposal of 32 types of dredged materials. Boh len et al.349 reported the distribution and fate of suspended matter during estuarine-channel dredging operations; from 1.5 to 3.0% of each bucket volume was lost in the water column. No evidence was found for the biomagnification of trace ele ments in marine food webs associated with contaminated out fall and harbor sediments; several metals and benzo(a)pyrene actually decreased with increased trophic level. Trophic levels were identified using both feeding-habit data and the cesium/ potassium ratio, a possible index of trophic level.350"351 Data from a series of related studies338"341 confirmed that significant recovery of kelp beds, intertidal seaweeds, benthic crustaceans, and bottom fish population has taken place during the past several years near the large Palos Verdes wastewater outfall in southern California. Reduction in solids emissions, kelp restoration, and source control of toxic chemicals and advantageous oc?anographie episodes have all contributed to the recovery. Effects such as fin erosion and occurrence of pollution tolerant macrofaunal organisms continue, however. REFERENCES Kinne, O., and Bulnheim, H.-P. (Eds.), "Protection of Life in the Sea."
