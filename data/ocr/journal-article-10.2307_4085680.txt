Sunderland, Massachusetts, Sinauer Assoc. xi + 494 pp. $27.50.-I recommend this book to everyone interested in bird behavior. Although it is about the behavior of animals in general, birds receive more</page><page sequence="2">820 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 96 attention than any other group. Half of the contributors to the volume are ornithologists, and one quarter of approximately one thousand references are ornithological. Fourteen chapters are organized under three headings: Predators and Prey; Sex, Mating and Signals; and Strategies in Space and Time. Each chapter is a thoroughly modern, readable, review of a topic, written to capture and hold the attention of upper level undergraduates but serving also, in the words of the editors, to "contain enough by way of new ideas and reviews to be of interest to research workers in behaviour and ecology." The book is primarily about behavior and secondarily about ecology. It really should be called something like "Animal Behavior, an Evolutionary Approach," but that title was pre- empted by John Alcock in 1975. The sources of inspiration have been the writings of evolutionary theorists such as W. D. Hamilton, J. Maynard Smith, R. L. Trivers, G. C. Williams, and E. 0. Wilson, rather than classical ethologists (N. Tinbergen being an outstanding exception). Most authors ask ques- tions of why animals behave in the way they do. It is fitting that the chapter dealing with populations most explicitly, written entertainingly by Henry Horn on life history tactics, is the last one. It is the only one that is primarily ecological. Being slightly out of place, it points to the need for a synthesis of behavior and ecology in an evolutionary context. I found Stephen Emlen's chapter on cooperative breeding in birds to be especially well organized and clear. This complex subject is summarized and illustrated with several case histories. Some original analyses are given, including a demonstration that the incidence of helping at the nest by Australian Superb Wrens decreases as the proportion of reproductive females increases. Behavior is given a good ecological perspective; demography is even mentioned! The chapter concludes with the development of six hypotheses to explain the evolution of cooperative breeding. These should serve as an extremely useful framework for organizing future studies of cooperative breeders. Likewise J. R. Krebs provides a clear and informative summary of another complex subject, the application of optimal foraging theory to animals, mainly birds. He discusses the laboratory and field evidence for optimal choice of food types, the effects of patchiness and resource renewal on search paths and diets, and such ecological consequences of optimal foraging as resource partitioning by competitors. There are serious difficulties with the theory, some of which are pointed out without equivocation; nevertheless the author ends on an enthusiastic note that characterizes the spirit of the book as a whole: "I take the optimistic view that in spite of all these difficulties, optimal foraging theory is by no means a failure in predicting how predators make decisions." In a chapter on habitat selection, Linda Partridge summarizes experimental evidence, including her own, demonstrating how birds choose a habitat or part of a habitat to exploit, how preferences develop, their adaptive significance, and implications for speciation theory. This area of research has certainly evolved since the pioneering descriptive studies were made by D. Lack, A. H. Miller, and G. Svardson, yet even now it seems to attract less attention from experimental biologists than other subjects treated in this volume, and not for want of theory. Territorial behavior is given detailed treatment by N. B. Davies. His chapter is structured to answer four questions: how do we recognize a territory; what are its functions and consequences; what determines territory size; and how are territories defended? Davies recognizes a territory when individuals or groups are spaced out more than would be expected from a random occupation of suitable habitats. This by- passes some difficulties encountered when trying to measure 'defended' or 'exclusive' areas, but runs into others, such as providing an operational definition of suitable habitat. There follows a review of attempts to study costs and benefits of holding territories. The best are from studies of nectar-feeding birds. The factors giving rise to unequal mating success of males are considered next, and the conclusion is reached that the problem of what the females choose-a male, a territory, or both-is unresolved. In fact W. K. Pleszcznska (1978, Science 201: 935-937) has shown that female Lark Buntings (Calamospiza melano- corys) respond to habitat features in deciding where to breed, so in this species choice of a male is apparently secondary to choice of a particular place. Interspecific territoriality is dealt with succinctly. Davies comes down on the side of it being adaptive to both of the participating species. But like J. Verner's super-territory concept, which is also discussed, the issues are complex and deserve more dis- cussion. Finally, after a consideration of density-limiting effects of territorial behavior, the chapter ends with a discussion of why one animal should obey the "keep-out" signals (e.g. song) of a territorial neighbor. J. Maynard Smith invented Evolutionary Stable Strategy analysis several years ago to deal with the more general form of this question, the question of why an animal capitulates in a ritualized (as opposed to physical) contest. A clear exposition is to be found in the chapter by R. Dawkins and J. R. Krebs on animal signals. It is the most provocative chapter in the book. If you embraced the concept of the selfish gene with enthusiasm, you will be delighted to learn that genes are cynical too. They encode behavior</page><page sequence="3">October 1979] Reviews 821 which misinforms an audience, thereby allowing the bearer to manipulate its colleagues for its own selfish purposes. According to the argument, birds keep out of other territories because they are misinformed about the numbers of their neighbors by the large vocal repertoire each possesses. This-in turn gives them an incorrect assessment of the probability of being attacked if they stray from the stockade. The chapter is explicitly anthropomorphic. The ideas may be wildly wrong but they are cogently argued. They had a strange effect on me, however. The authors establish a link between animal signals and human ad- vertising where the goal of the advertiser is to persuade. Because the entire chapter is a piece of advertising for a particular point of view, I was left at the end with the curious feeling that the authors might be mere unwitting vehicles of their own cynical genes, reciprocating altruistically, of course, but not with us. Forgive them their genes, for they know not what they do. In a chapter on sexual selection and mate choice, T. R. Halliday surveys the ideas and evidence that mating systems and the distribution of parental investment between the sexes are dependent on two classes of factors; ecological factors, such as food availability, and intrinsic factors, most important being the difference between the sexes in the size and number of their gametes. The intrinsic factors are elaborated by J. Maynard Smith in a chapter on sex. Other chapters, with varying degrees of relevance to the study of birds, deal with group living (B. C. R. Bertram), defences against predators (P. H. Harvey and P. J. Greenwood), searching for mates (G. A. Parker), decision making (R. H. McCleery), and insect sociality (B. Heinrich). I have two general comments to make about the content of the book. First, I was struck by the large number of statements of the form "If variation in the observed behavior has a genetic basis, we can make the following adaptive argument." It seems that behavioral genetics has made little contribution to the topics discussed in this book, although more than is evident here. Second, there is a profound division of attitudes or philosophies among evolutionary biologists at present that is not reflected in this book. The debate concerns whether the optimization approach to understanding evolution is useful, in a sci- entific sense, or not. The controversy is not apparent in the book because most authors either do not question the usefulness of the approach or ignore it. Yet there are serious problems that have been raised mildly and sporadically in the past, but pointedly and acerbically more recently by R. C. Lewontin (e.g. 1979, Behavioral Science 24: 5-14). These objections certainly apply to this volume, where several adaptive explanations are dangerously close to being empty by leaving virtually no room for alternatives. J. Maynard Smith (1978, Ann. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 8: 31-56) has written an eloquent if not entirely successful rejoinder to Lewontin's objections. Both papers provide valuable/essential supplemental reading to this volume. The illustrations are excellent, and the writing is generally very clear and surprisingly uniform in standard and style. I suspect the editors took their job seriously. They have succeeded in making this more a book than a collection of articles by extensive cross-referencing and by introducing each of the three major sections with a helpful scene-setting prelude. I noticed only one typographical error, one figure without a legend (following 11. 7), one confusion concerning functional and evolutionary questions (p. 317), one piece of obscene jargon, and one piece of cumbersome jargon (explosive female access polyandry; EFAP!). The goal of stimulating an interest in the subject at all levels from undergraduate to senior research worker is likely to be fully met by this welcome book.-P. R. GRANT.</page></plain_text>
