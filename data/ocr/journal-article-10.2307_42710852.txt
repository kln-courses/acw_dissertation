<plain_text><page sequence="1">CARLA GOTTLIEB Respiciens per Fenestras: The Symbolism of the Mérode Altarpiece" To Meyer Schapiro for his 65th birthday. The Mérode altarpiece (painted ca. 1425-1430; revised, date unknown) (Fig. 1) appears periodically in the discussions of art historians, it seems to me, not only because of its influence but also because it intrigues us with its features, explained and unexplained. One of these is that it should carry a sym- bolic message while portraying commonplace things. De Tolnay, Meiss, Schapiro and Panofsky have dealt with this phenomenon1, Panofsky coining the expression 'disguised symbolism' for it. But has the veil been fully lifted, the mask indeed been torn away? Descriptions call the room in which the Annunciation to Mary takes place a 'domestic interior.' The presence of a liturgical niche (Fig. 6) contradicts this identification, however; it unmistakably labels the locale as a sanctuary. The fifteenth century middle class would not instai a piscina in their diningrooms. Even in their bedrooms they used only a jug and basin placed upon a piece of furniture, as can be seen in the later Flemish artists like Roger van der Weyden (Fig. 3)2 who localized the Annunciation in the Thalamus Virginis, not in the Templům Trinitatis. Yet, in a church, piscinae have been part of the normal furnishings since early Christian times. Pope Leo IV (847-855) is known to art historians mainly through Raphael's Incendio fresco, but to liturgists he appears as author of the instruction ordering the provision of water dispensers and towels in churches : 'One should prepare in the sacristy (secretarium) or nearby a place where it is possible to pour the water which has served to purify the sacred vessels; one should place there a clean linen with a fountain, and here the priest will wash his hands after having dispensed the Communion'3. The synod of Würzburg in 1298, on the other hand, in its canon No. 3 enacted the installation of a piscina near each altar, and as late as 1601 the general chapter of the Cistercian monks repeated this instruction4. The difference in location * This article is part of a book on The Window in Painting. It has been read by Profs. Julius Held and Meyer Schapiro whose constructive criticism I gratefully acknowledge.

In these churches it was imperative to have the fountains next to the altar so that the Service was not disrupted. Fig. 4 shows the thirteenth century piscina in the chapel of the Holy Spirit at Mechelen6, the town in which the Ingelbrechts, who have been identified as the donors of the Mérode altarpiece through the coat of arms at the left7, resided; the piscina of Master Campin looks architecturally like an up- dated version of the Mechelen one. The latter's laver is no longer in place. However, a vessel identical to Campin's is preserved in the church of St. Léonard at Zoutleeuw (Fig. 5)8. Braun illustrates his study of liturgical equipment with two similar lavers in German churches9, and has the following to say about these: 'A late (Eine letzte) type of liturgical vessel for pouring, which only came into use towards the end of the Middle Ages, but then very rapidly became appreciated and has maintained itself in use until the present, consisted of a voluminous kettle of medium size which was invested with one or two spouts and a handle for suspending it. Where the custom of washing the hands after Sacrifice and Communion prevailed, it was suspended in the piscina, in which case either a basin or a basinlike depression in the floor of the piscina was provided for the disposal of the water used for the ablution. Where it was not the custom to wash the hands at the piscina after the Sacrifice and Com- munion, it was placed in the sacristy, and this is always the case in postmediaeval times'10. Braun also reproduces a fifteenth century miniature in which the piscina with the liturgical vessels can be seen next to the altar at which a Mass is celebrated and Leroquais brings the same from the beginning of the sixteenth century11. Even a hundred and twenty five years after the Mérode Annunciation was executed, the fountain with laver suspended from a chain can still be seen in art, cf. the Mass of St. Gregory (1552), attributed to Jan van Coninxloo, now at Brussels (Fig. 7)12. Like the niche, the laver and 'linen' in the Mérode Annunciation are not household goods, but liturgical paraphernalia13. 5. Jungmann, 1948, II, 507-508. 6. E.

Located opposite to the tower of St. Rombouts' Cathedral, at the corner of the Minderbroe- dergang, the chapel dates probably from the end of the thirteenth century and served as a center to help the poor (Léopold Godenne, Malines Jadis et Aujourd'hui , Mechelen 1908, 384). It resembles the Mérode shrine also in other respects. As can be seen from a print of 1797 (Godenne, 382), it had a gateway surmounted by a little house. Godenne's description of 1908 mentions a window in the wall with the niche (p. 385). A second room lies to the right (as seen from the spectator) of this wall. Unfortunately the building has been remodelled since, and the window is no longer visible nor is it possible to tell where, originally, the doors were located. Mr. Fors of Mechelen has been instrumental in my gaining admittance to, and information on, this chapel. 7. Hugo von Tschudi, 'Der Meister von Flemalle', Jahrbuch der kgl.

In imitation of piscinae, washstands with lavers and jugs came into use about 1500 and can be followed throughout the seventeenth century; they were either fabricated as a separate piece of furniture, or as a part of a large commode, or as a part of a wainscotting. Exam- 66</page><page sequence="3">Before turning to the next point, a correction may be made to the symbolic interpretation of the piscina presently in use. It does not symbolize the purity of the Madonna, but purification in baptism, which cleanses from sin through the mercy of Christ. It is a reference to Jesus, not to the Virgin14. Honorius Augustodunensis (early twelfth century) writes on the subject as follows: ' The laver in which the hands are washed next to the altar stands for the mercy that flows from Christ by which men in baptism or in penance are cleansed of their filth . . ( Gemma Animae, I, chapt. 136: De Propitia- torio)15. The same interpretation is offered by Durandus (ca. 1230-1296): 'Near to the Altar, which signifieth Christ, is placed the Piscina, or Lavacrum, that is, the Pity of Christ, in which the Priest washeth his hands, thereby denoting, that by Baptism and Penitence we are purged from the filth of sin . . .' ( Rationale , I, 1, 39)16. In Justus von Ravensburg's Annunciation at Santa Maria di Castello, Genoa (1451), which is dependent upon the Mérode (and Ghent) Annunciation (Fig. 8)17, a similar liturgical niche is shown and its symbolic meaning clarified by the addition of the motif of a bird dip- ping into the living waters of the fountain, a reference to the human soul which is saved through the Coming of Christ. Because the piscina is a reference to Jesus' charitable activity in behalf of mankind, it is placed next to the Holy Infant and His messenger, the angel, in the Mérode Annunciation, within Gabriel's room in the Genoese Annunciation 18. The door in the Mérode (and Ravensburg) Annunciation is open. The open door in paintings of the Incarnation or Annunciation is a reference to the gates of paradise, closed to man by Our Parents' trespass and reopened by Christ's sacrifice. The pseudo- Augustine formulates this thought in a Naviti- ty sermon as follows: 'Heaven's gate shut of old by Adam, has already given sound . . . O, Virgin perpetual: now is it that your faith either opens, or closes heaven . . .' (In Natali Domini IV (b), Sermo 120 Appx)19. The simile of the door to heaven reopened by the Incarnation is so widely used by patristic writers and Christian poets that further source material need not be listed. Sometimes the author links it either directly or by oblique cross reference, as in the pseudo-Augustine, to another gate simile, one as frequently encountered and also connected to the Annunciation and Incarnation: the Closed Portal of Perpetual Virginity. Which of the two is symbolized in a painting has to be decided on hand of the way the motif is portrayed and placed. An open door situated next to Gabriel in an Annunciation or Incarnation picture would signify primarily the Redemption and only seconda- rily, if at all, the Virginal Motherhood20. The opposite is the case if a closed door is portrayed and located next to the Virgin. pies can be seen in the Landesmuseum, Zurich (Claude Lapaire, Trésors du Musée National, Neuchatel 1962, pl. 38). Concomitantly, however, piscinae, i.e. stone niches in a wall, continued to be con- structed in sanctuaries (ibid., example from St. Gallen, dating from 1573). 14. The interpretation of the piscina as a symbol of purification has been proposed by Mrs. Lotte Brand Philip, 'Raum und Zeit in der Verkündigung des Genter Altares,' Wallraf-Richartz-Jahrbuch, XXIX (1967) 87-88, but without the reference to Christ and Baptism. 15.

From its chain is suspended a second, larger, key, presumably fitting the larger lock in the portal of the wall fencing in the garden. This latter key resem- bles in ornateness the keys made for reliquaries21 ; apparently its bit forms the monogram IHC which would declare Jesus Himself as the owner of this dwelling. To use the name of the Lord in the bit of a real key was not a common device in Flanders during the fifteenth century, as a comparison with the six keys of the Museum Mayer van der Bergh, Antwerp, proves (Fig. 10); crosses, as seen in keys Nos. 1 and 3 counted from the left, seem to have been the popular mode of expressing a Christological affiliation. However, in Justus' Annunciation, the message that the shrine belongs to Jesus is likewise delivered by means of a monogram of Christ, here in its Bernardinian form and imprinted upon one room's ceiling, the other's bed (?) furnishings22. A key, on the other hand, is placed in the door to a closet in the lectern and hence has to be associated with the Virgin. The motif of the key thus poses three questions : Can Jesus, like the Madonna, be identified with a shrine? Whose attribute is the key, His or Mary's? What is its meaning? Following in the steps of Yrjö Hirn, the interpretation of the Church as the Virgin Mary, the Sacred Shrine who harbored Christ, has become a household word in the writings of art historians who deal with Christian symbolism. There exists, however, a less well known but much earlier inter- pretation of the Ecclesia which identifies it with the Mystical Body of Christ whose members are the Congregation of the Faithful23. It dates back to apostolic time and survives into the present24. There- fore, to read a sanctuary as a symbol for Christ Himself is compatible with Christian thought. As regards the key, whether it be monogrammed or plain, it is the symbol of Jesus as the Key to Heaven, which simile also dates back to the time of the evangelists; using the passage XXII, 22 from the prophecy of Isaiah: 'And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder: and he shall open, and none shall shut: and he shall shut, and none shall open'. St. Matthew (XVI, 19) and the Apocalypse (I, 18; III, 7-8) proclaim that Christ has the keys to heaven and hell. As owner, Jesus cedes them to His delegates : Mary, the Coeli Fenestra , Paradisi Porta, a privilege accorded to her because she consented to serve as her Son's hostel25, and Simon-Peter, the Claviger Coeli, Coeli Janitor, a privilege accorded to him because he believed in Christ (Matth. XVI, 16-19). The reference to a Christological key in the text of Revelation (III, 7-8) was, according to the Golden Legend, sung as one of the seven anthems before the Nativity Feast26. It is so apposite for the situation presented in the Mérode altarpiece that it may have served as a basis for the motifs connected with the donors.

Behold, I have given before thee a door opened, which no man can shut: because thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name'. In the center panel of the altarpiece, the Infant Christ is descending toward the Virgin upon seven golden rays, a reference to the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Through His coming, He has opened the doors to the kingdom of heaven and all those who have '. . . kept His word, and have not denied His name . . will be permitted to enter it. Three persons can be seen in the Virgin's Hortus Conclusas, which here is also the Parvis or paradise of Jesus' shrine: the donors kneel near to the Holy of Holies, the artist27 stands modestly upon the outskirts of the garden. The latter, whose work is the glorifi- cation of Jesus and Mary in paint, and the former, whose deeds are the commissioning of this glori- fication, have proven their faith in God. As is customary in the Catholic Mass, they have presented an offertory, and it has been judged a 'just' one. Now they have been admitted to the garden of paradise with the other Justs. In a recent article, Miss Ursula Nilgen has identified a series of rectangular and round tables in Nativities and Epiphanies as being at the same time altars and mangers28. Although she does not include Annunciations in her survey, her deductions are valid also for these. They dispense with the need for the argument I had prepared to prove that the sixteensided table in the Mérode Annunciation is an altar29. To her evidence may be added the fact that round altartables can be documented in paintings contemporary with Campin. The Buxtehude altarpiece, attributed to Master Bertram (ca. 1390-1400) uses one in the scene of the Circumcision (Fig. II)30. As regards the sixteen sides which Campin gives to the Mérode table, according to Hrabanus Maurus' number symbolism (De Univ., XVIII, 3)31, the figure 'sixteen' is a reference to the prophets of the Old Testament. Quite correctly, the master has identified his altar as Hebrew, which it still is at the moment - but not for long, because the cross is on its way and will complete the altar's equipment, a Bible, candle, and holy vessel, for service in a Christian church, cf. Fig. 2. Other motifs belonging to the Annunciation room in the painting - the steps and Gabriel's rai- ment - tie in with its interpretation as a shrine. The three steps are the steps leading to the altar plat- form, in the fifteenth century - as, for that matter, today - an integral part of church design, with aesthetic and tropologie meaning. Aesthetically, they prepare man for his spiritual experience (cf. Tertullian, De Orat., c. 1 1)32; tropologically they stand for the martyrs and Virtues who ascend to God 27. Cf. Julius Held quoted in Panofsky, 1953, 423 for this identifi- cation, accepted by Lotte Philip, (verbal communication) Theodore Rousseau, 'The Merode Altarpiece', Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, XVI (1957) 126 see in the figure a marriage broker and Helmut Nickel, 'The Man beside the Gate,' ibid., XXIV (19 66) 239-243 a messenger. 28.

As regards the angel's garments, his alb and stole identify him as a deacon36. The deacon is the assistant to the celebrant of the Mass ; Jesus Himself will officiate as priest. He arrives, carrying over His shoulder the cross that will not only transform the Jewish shrine into a Christian one, but is a reference to the Crucifixion which is perpetually commemorated in the Sacrifice of the Mass. Conse- quently Christ will be, as asserted in the Innocentium after the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, . . ipse sacerdos &amp; sacrificium . . .'37 priest-offerer and Host-offering in one. The fact that the In- carnation is usually linked to the Transubstantiation in Christian thought, and viceversa, is not well known outside of Catholic circles. This interpretation can be traced back as far as the pseudo-Dio- nysius (ca. 500) who, when commenting on the rite of ostension of the Mass in his Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, says: 'Such are the teachings that the high priest reveals in accomplishing the rites of the holy liturgy, when he publicly unveils the offerings that before were hidden; . . . This shows us, in a sensible manner and as it were in an image, how Christ Himself came forth from His mysterious divine sanctuary to take the figure of a man for the love of man '38. In art, the connection can be seen in a miniature of the Bible Moralisée, where the Annunciation is set next to the Eucharist (Fig. 12)39. The presence in the room of the Infant with cross as a reference to the Eucharist is a second indi- cation that this room represents the interior of a shrine. It serves as a variant for the motif of the Host in its container as it can be found in the Annunciation of the Vyšegrad evangeliary (ca. 1085), in which the Eucharist in its pyxis stands upon the altar (Fig. 13)40, or in the Annunciation at Sierndorf near Vienna, a carved retable attributed to the Master of the Mörlin Monument (1518) in which the lectern of the Virgin actually houses the Host of the church41. A third example, contemporary with Campin, may appear in Neri di Bicci's Annunciation (Accademia, Florence)42 in which a tiny panel with the Crucifixion held by angels, motif for often used tabernacledoors43, is set like a coat of arms in front of the chamber where the Annunciation takes place; if this is not a tabernacle, then, as a picture 34.

Now, the difference between the Annunciations with a Host-container and those with the Christ Child is that the former show a sanctuary containing the tabernacle, while the latter are the tabernacle itself; in the former, a representation of the Incarnate Christ is a heresy44, in the latter the Infant can be shown in the flesh because He is already in the womb. Like the church, the tabernacle is a symbol for the Virgin as the hostel of Christ, cf. Durandus, Rationale (I, 3, 25): 'And notice that the portfolio (container) in which the consecrated Host is kept, signifieth the frame (body) of the Blessed Virgin'45. The symbol is particularly appropriate in an Annunciation or Incarnation picture. The interpretation of the Annunciate's room as a shrine explains only some of the altarpiece's un- common traits. Others can be understood if it is read as an illustration to the Song of Songs. This ancient love poem, attributed by tradition to King Solomon, was one of the most popular Old Testa- ment books with the Fathers of the Church, and a great number of commentaries on it survive46. It was also a storehouse for painters, particularly for the Early Netherlandish School47, and their immediate successors who created the Tota Pulchra image in the second half of the fifteenth century48. The commentaries, provided they belong to the school of mystical interpretation49, are fairly homo- geneous; they may differ in length or in the images but, in the main points, the meaning of the texts is identical. All Christian authors agree that, as a whole, the Canticle describes the marriage of Christ; but in some the Church, i.e. the community of the faithful, is identified as His bride, in others the Soul. Or, an author may use both interpretations, as is the case in Origen. This is the main variance. Ac- cording to Christian exegesis, the Incarnation is the inauguration of this marriage which is completed at the Parousia, in between being continued in the church's sacramental life50. Since the Madonna is mystically equated with the Church, in art the marriage of Christ with the Ecclesia can be portrayed under an anthropomorphic form. Art historians have recognized it in the Coronation of the Virgin, an event which will take place at Jesus' Second Coming (Fig. 14)51. Coro- nation pictures are sometimes inscribed with a legend taken from the Canticle (IV, 8): 'Come from Libanus, my spouse, come from Libanus, come: thou shalt be crowned . . .' demonstrating the deri- vation of the pictorial image from the poem. According to patristic writings, Incarnation pictures which 44. David M. Robb, 'The Iconography of the Annunciation in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries', Art Bulletin , XVIII, (1936) 526. 45.

Yet, as far as I know, pictures of the Incarnation have not been interpreted in this way. As a matter of fact, in itself a claim is not proof that art utilized the exegesis of the Church Fathers. Such a proof would reside either in an inscription taken from the Song of Songs (as is the case in the Coronation of the Virgin ) or in the use of images from it. It so happens that the room of the Annunciate in the Mérode altarpiece reflects the particulars given to Solomon's bridal chamber in the Canticle. This chamber is called '. . . the „cella" of wine . . .' (II, 4), and reference is made to several windows of which one, at least, was closed by latticework: '. . . looking through the windows, looking through the lattices . . .' (II, 9), as well as to a ceiling of beams and rafters: 'The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress trees . . .' (I, 16). In the Bibles contemporaneous with Campin, the expression 'cella vinaria' is translated alternately as 'the house of wine' or 'the cellar of wine'52. Within the context of the Christian exegesis, the house of wine can only be either the church or the tabernacle, and the cellar of wine either these, or the church's crypt, or its baptistry - to wit, Hrabanus Maurus who uses the text of the Song of Songs when referring to church windows53. As was seen, The Mérode Annunciation renders the tabernacle. This tabernacle has three windows, one closed by a lattice screen. Moreover, its ceiling is wooden. On the surface, the wooden ceiling of the Mérode Annunciation is a vital proof for the domestic interior theory, not for the circumscription of a sanctuary. In truth, the contrary is correct. If the Master of Flémalle wanted to portray a shrine of Jesus, or even any shrine, he could have vaulted his room, as is done in many copies of the Mérode Annunciation 54, and, by that means, he would have made it evident even to twentieth century eyes that he was representing a sanctuary. Yet, if he wished to depict the Nuptial Chamber from the Song of Solomon, he had to render it as defined in the poem. Given the fact that the setting of the Mérode Annunciation is in full harmony with the Canticle's setting for the royal wedding, the hypothesis that Campin illustrates Our Lord's marriage according to the Song of Songs may be further explored. From the different passages in the text which were read as references to the First Coming, the Second Coming, and the Sacraments, only that relating to the First Coming, the Incarnation, concerns us here. Again all commentators who explain the Bible in a mystical fashion agree as to which passage it is. With the possible exception of the earliest surviving Christian commentary on the Canticle, that of Hippolytus of Rome (fl. 217-235), which is poorly preserved and hence could be understood differently55, they link this mystery to verse II, 9 : 'Behold he standeth behind our wall, Looking through the windows, Looking through the lattices . . .' 52. Delitzsch, 1875, 41 note 1 translates the original's Ì-T^^ 5 (el beit ha-yayin) with 'the house where wine is drunk'. 53. De Univ. XIV, 23 (Migne, P. L., CXI, c. 401. B). 54.

(Jaap Leeuwenberg, 'Die Ausstrahlung Utrechter Tonplastik', Studien zur Geschichte der Europäischen Plastik. Festschrift Theodor Müller , Mün- chen 1965, Fig. 19). 55. 1 believe, however, that Hippolytus also refers to the Incarnation. In the relevant passage (De Cantico , XXIII) he calls the prophet to witness that 'windows have opened in heaven', and then explains this 'window of the prophets' as that through which '. . . the Word has streamed out effulgiently to suffuse the other side (with light) . . .' (G. 76</page><page sequence="13">and interpret these lines as follows55*1. Christ, the Celestial Bridegroom, stands behind the wall of the house in which His bride waits for Him and looks at her through the latticework of its windows. The lattice screens and wall surfaces (i.e. a window's solid portions) signify the human flesh with which He clothed Himself at the Incarnation; respectively, they either permit a glimpse of the light, Jesus' divine glory (reading of the Eastern writers), or conceal it from us mortals (reading of the Western). The word: (harak-latticed window) was translated with Six-rOa (diktya-nets) by the first, with cancelli-l attices by the second. The examples quoted below will clarify the difference. The section of Hippolytus' commentary which has come down to us does not contain an exegesis on the meaning of the lattices or wall. Illustrating the Eastern version, Origen (ca. 185-ca. 254), who is the author of a surviving exegesis on the Canticle next in date to Hippolytus, writes as follows: 'He came to the nets when He assumed a human body that was held in the snares of the hostile powers. He broke those nets asunder for you, and you say: 'Behold, He is at the back, behind our wall, looking in through the windows, become visible through the nets' . . . (Sec. Homily on the Can- ticle, II, 9)57. Origen's interpretation of the Canticle was known to the West - his Commentary on it survived mainly in the Latin translation by Rufinus (340/5-410) and his Homilies on it in that by St. Jerome (ca. 347-4 19)58. It is my impression that the Western exegesis of the poem is indebted to the Alexandrian. However, it is impossible to say to whom is owed the shift in emphasis from nets to wall. It can be found already in Gregory the Great's (ca. 450-604) Exposito in Cantica, which reads: 'As though the Incarnate Christ stood behind our wall, because His divinity lay hidden in His assumed humanity . . .'59 To round off the picture and give the full range of interpretations, there ought still to be quoted the Western Divine who generally departs furthest from Origen's exegesis and from that of the other Western authors. This is St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1091-1 153)60. His Sermo No. 66 on the Canticle runs: 'The flesh is the wall, and the Bridegroom's drawing near denotes the Incarnation of the Word . . .'61 In the case of the interpretation of verse II, 9, St. Bernard is in full agreement with the Eastern and other Western exegetes62.

It deals mainly with the window in ancient and patristic literature and does not go into its use in art. I was pleased to note that Horn's conclusions bore out my interpretation. 56. The Latin expression 'cancelli' designates two things in mediae- val Latin: (1) the latticework of a window, as those of the harem; and (2) the parapet around a church quoir, (the room enclosed by it being referred to as the cancellus). In English the words 'screen', 'grille' probably cover the two aspects most closely. By extension from the latticework of a window, the double columns subdividing a Romanes- que church window may also be called cancelli; and by extension from the parapet of a choir, other parapets may be referred to as cancelli . Each type had a different symbolic meaning. (Sauer, 1924, 121-2, 122 note 1, 127, 129 note 2, 394). 57. Migne, P. G. XIII, c. 57 B, C. Quoted from Origen.

Under the circumstances it must have been a familiar Christian symbol. If it is feasible to translate the verbal image into pictorial language, it may be expected in painters who were involved with symbolism and given to inserting windows in their pictures. For these artists, the poem's window image would furnish an opportunity to legitimize the presence of a favorite motif. Obviously, the Master of Flémalle qualifies in both respects. He was not only interested in symbolism but even uses images from the Canticle in his Mérode altarpiece, such as the Hortus Conclusus (IV, 12). His windows are famous. As mentioned above, the chamber of the Mérode Annunciation has three : the two in the wall with the door are tondi and the one behind Mary is a casement. But, do they signify the Celestial Bridegroom of the Song of Songs? The motif of the tondo was probably borrowed from Italian art in which a wheel window and the Dove travelling toward the Virgin upon the rays of the sun appear at the same place as in Campin in a number of paintings, starting with Agnolo Gaddi and his school in the second half of the fourteenth century and continuing into the fifteenth (cf. Fig. 15)63. While maintaining the motif of the sun rays, Campin has modified the Italian image in replacing the Dove by the Infant, the window's tracery by a glasspane, which is reinforced with lead bars in the form of a cross, and by using two roundels. The meaning of the glasspane penetrated by the sun and remaining undamaged as a symbol of the Virginal Conception has been discussed in detail by Hirn, Meiss and Schapiro64. The wheel in the Italian painting is a symbol of the sun65. The circle which has neither beginning nor end is a symbol of God66. The cross-in-a-circle in the Flemish painting signifies the cross nimbus, attribute of Christ67. The wheel window and the crossed tondi are, each in their own way, symbols of Christ. The two tondi in Campin suggest that Christ's two natures are referred to : the unmanifest divine is signified in the farther roundel, the manifest human in the nearer, through which the Word has just passed and in passing was covered and clothed with the substance of the Virgin to become man, as Guillaume de exact parallels of the Christian. The earliest preserved, the Aramic Targum , does not, in its present state, antedate the sixth century A. D. but probably reverts to a much earlier prototype (Jastrow, 1921, 67- 73). It identifies the lover with Yahweh and the beloved with the congregation of Israel, and interprets the poem as an allegorical out- line of Jewish history from the Exodus to the coming of the Messiah (Hermann Gollancz ed., The Targum to ' The Song of Songs' London 1908, 3). Verse II, 9 is interpreted as the Shekinah, The Dwelling (cf. Ex. XXV, 8, XXIX, 45, 46, Num. V, 3, XXXV, 34, etc.), i.e. the manifestation of a Divine Presence. In the night before the Exodus, God is ' . . peering through the lattice, and He saw the blood of the Passover-sacrifice', (ibid., p. 34). Later commentaries explain the wall as either Mount Sinai or the synagogue ( Midrash Rabbah, tr. H. Freedman &amp; Maurice Simon, London 1961, 118, 119); the win- dows are seen as either a reference to the merits of the patriarchs and the lattices to those of the matriarchs, or as the spaces between the shoulders of the priests and those between their fingers through which God peers (sparkles) at the congregation during the blessing (ibid., 119, 121). The Hebrew word for 'peereth' means actually 'sparkleth' (S. M. Lehrman, The Five Megilloth, fifth repr., London 1965, 7 note to verse II, 9) which is conducive to conjure up the image of the sun as well as that of a supranatural presence. 63.

The interpretation of the tondi as refe- rences to Jesus is borne out by the fact that all three windows in the chamber of the Mérode Annun- ciation were, originally, done in gold69, the equivalent of the Divine Presence in celestial space. In a revision, this was changed to greyish-white sky tones which is less obvious as a symbol for Christ and obscures that the pictorial image corresponds to the verbal image found in the Song of Songs: symbolized as light, the Bridegroom is 'looking through the windows'. The casement window back of the Virgin displays a wooden lattice screen through which the light peers. The screen looks innocently commonplace but so does the room, table, and towel. Once it is known that the room signifies a shrine, the table an altar, and the towel the 'linen' instituted by Leo IV as a liturgical object necessary for sacramental ablutions, the screen is assessed as a symbol of the mortal flesh which hides Christ's Light Body. The wooden screen is placed in the window section nearest the Madonna, the adjacent section, further from her, is shuttered; and the sections above the screen and shutter are open. Reading the meaning of the shutter and screen according to the Canticle's interpreters, the spectator understands the former as an illustration by symbol that the Heavenly Bridegroom is hidden from mortal eyes and the latter as an illustration by symbol that He reveals Himself to His chosen Bride; He looks at her. It remains to interpret the view through this window's two open top sections which, in the revision of the triptych were changed from gold to clouds. The sky in the two wings of the altarpiece is also overcast but, if the present coloring can be trusted, then the portion seen from the Annunciation chamber has threatening storm clouds in cold dark-grey tones, tinged with blue, while the portions seen in the wings have serene looking clouds in a warm grey tone, tinted with yellow and pink. What does the Song of Songs have to say about clouds? Clouds are the prelude and aftermath of rain, and the Song of Solomon speaks of the winter and rains which have passed, leaving everything in bloom, announcing the time of pruning and bringing the turtle to declare the arrival of spring: 'For winter is now past; the rain is over and gone. The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the turtle is heard in our land . . .' (II, 11-12). In Israel, the rainy season lasts from November through February today, and we know from Hesiod ( Works and Days, V, 564-570) that, in ancient Greece, pruning was done in March. Following the chronological pointer, the Canticle was scheduled for the Passover Feast in the synagogue's rote of readings from the Old Testament70. Quite naturally, the Church Fathers set its happenings likewise at Eastertide but interpreted them in a Christian sense71. They saw the winter which had passed as the domination of the Law which had come to an end with the Incarnation of Christ. The rains were likened to the words of the Prophets by the Eastern writers72, to the false 68. Ed. J. J. Stürzinger, London 1897, 39-40. 69. William Suhr, 'The Restoration of the Mérode Altarpiece', Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , XVI (1957) 144. 70. Delitzsch, 1875, p. 3 note 1. 71. According to the Midrash Rabbah (1961, 122-3), the winter and the rains refer to the sojourn of the Jews in Egypt, and the flowers signify their leaders in the Exodus, Moses and Aaron. 72. Origen, Comm. Cant, in Migne, P. G., XIII, c. 182.B. 79</page><page sequence="16">teachings of the heretics by the Western73, one of the few cases when the Occident diverges in the inter- pretation of the Canticle from the Orient. They meet again in the exegesis of the arrival of spring. This meant the Resurrection: '„Behold, the winter is past, the rain has departed, the flowers have appeared on the earth." In rising from the dead I have curbed the storm and restored calm' (Origen, Sec. Horn .)74 'But when these passed and the dry land appeared and flowers bloomed upon it, showing that pruning time had come at last, when do you think that was? When indeed could it be, save when the Flesh of Christ blossomed anew in the Resurrection?' (St. Bernard, Sermo LVIIip. One glance at the sward with the tall, blooming rosebush76 in the background of the Mérode altar- piece's donor panel and at the lawn with flowers in its foreground suffices to prove that the arrival of spring is signified. This suggests that the portrayal of the clouds may also be based upon the text of the Canticle77, expressing that the dominion of the Law (Eastern exegesis) or Belial (Western) is still in force in the Annunciate's panel, but has been overcome in the donors' panel through the arrival of the Sun. However, an alternate interpretation is likewise possible for the view behind the Virgin. In Christian exegesis, the cloud was customarily a symbol of Mary and rain of Christ: '. . . as a cloud [Mary] rained upon the earth the grace of Christ. The shower of this sacred cloud our fathers announced to us would be the world's salvation. This rain quenched the appetite of Eve: the un- guent wiped away the stench of hereditary error' (St. Ambrose, De Inst. Virg. XIII, 81-84)78. The simile was founded upon Isaiah (XLV, 8) which, by substituting 'the Just' for 'righteousness,' and 'the Savior' for 'salvation,' was translated as follows: 'Drop down dew, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain the just: let the earth be opened, and bud forth a saviour: and let justice spring up together: I the Lord have created him'. Since Mary was not only the Cloud which carried the Savior but also the Inviolate Earth which sheltered Him, the Fleece of Gideon, the Flower without Thorns, and the Branch (virgo) from the tree of Jesse79, the references to Christ as rain appear also connected to the later images. St. Jerome formulates the mystery as follows : 'A rain entirely heavenly shed itself with tranquil fall on the virginal fleece, and the whole shower of divinity poured upon her flesh, when the Word was made Flesh; and afterwards, under the pressure of the gibbet of the Cross, shed forth the rain of salvation on all lands, and let fall the droppings of grace into the souls of man'. 73.

Again the link with the Jewish exegesis is obvious. The Aramaic Tar g um, in interpreting verse II, 9 of the Canticle, refers to Yahweh seeing ' . . the blood of the Passover-sacrifice . . .' and, in interpreting verse II, 12, mentions . . the voice of the Holy Spirit of salvation . . .' (Gollancz, 1908, 34, 36). 76. The enormous rosebush and the birds of the donor panel bring to mind the fact that some Bible texts translate Canticle II, 1 or 2, and Canticle II, 12 as: 'I am the rose of Sharon . . .' (instead of . flower of the field . . .)' or' . . . the rose among thorns . . .' (in- stead of '. . . lily . . .') and ' . . the time of the singing of birds is come . . .' (instead of '. . . the time of pruning is come . . .'). 77. According to the rabbinical exegesis, the Shekinah above the Ark of the Covenant, i.e. the external manifestation of Yahweh' s presence, assumed the form of a cloud : 'He rode upon a light cloud . . .' can be read in the Aramaic Targum as commentary to verse II, 9 (Gol- lancz, 1908, 34). 78.

Versified the same simile appears in the fourteenth century French poem De S. Maria as follows :81 'Sicut terram pluvia 'Like rain the earth Sic divina gratia So divine grace Virginem fecundať. Makes the Virgin fruitful', while a fifteenth century manuscript at Munich phrases it in the poem De b. Virgine :82 'Radix Jesse speciosa 'Beautiful Root of Jesse Virga florens et frondosa Flowering and leafy branch Quam rigavit copiosa Which copiously watered Deitatis pluvia'. The rain of God'. The Speculum Humanae Salvationis speaks of the Flower from the Tree of Jesse '. . . filled with the dew of heaven, which has produced for us Jesus Christ . . .'83 and Cornelius a Lapide, in the sixteenth century, repeats the same in his commentary on the Virgin: 'The heaven sinks down and the earth rises, God has a mother, and a Virgin has God as Son'84. In the Mérode Annunciation , the clouds pregnant with rain may then signify the bridal of God and the Virgin. Their shadows can be interpreted as a reference to St. Luke (I, 35) '. . . and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee', a passage linked by the Church Fathers to the shadow lying upon life on earth85. The stormy sky behind the Virgin next to the smiling sky behind Gabriel are apt pictorial metaphors for the mystery that the wrathful Ancient of Days is becoming the God of Mercy to accomplish the compassionate work of reconciliation. This interpretation does not exclude that the storm clouds also signify the dominion of the Law or Antichrist, which comes to an end, and the sunny clouds signify the dominion of Grace and Christ, which begins, a reading based upon the commentaries on the Canticle. In Christian symbolism, one motif can carry several different meanings and one meaning can be carried through several different motifs, cf. St. Augustine {Sermo XCIV) : 'Thus, just as one and the same thing can be said by many words, so one and the same thing is accustomed to be signified by many figurative events'86. In Campin's Annunciation, the stalk with three lily blossoms in the jug on the table-altar, stands for Mary's virginity ante partem, in partu, and post partem 87 but, as flower, it identifies also the locale, since Nazareth was incorrectly translated from the Hebrew to mean 'flower'88. The Inviolate Concep- tion, on the other hand, is referred to by the undamaged glass as well as the Hortus Conclusus. Cu- 80. Epistola IX ad Paulam et Eustochium (Migne, P.L., XXX, c. 127.A-B.). 81.

To the contrary, as has been noted by Wind: 'Apparently incompatible inter- pretations enrich rather than confuse the argument'89. In view of this peculiarity in Christian thinking, it is necessary to ask whether or not the window with the lattice screen, behind the Virgin, carries also a second meaning. Since it is the pictorial counterpart of the piscina, symbol of Christ's merciful activity in behalf of mankind, it is reasonable to assume that it signifies Mary's merciful activity in behalf of mankind under the guise of the Fenestra Coeli. This is all the more probable since the Church Fathers, as well as the poets, explicitly state that '. . . Jesus took flesh of the Virgin . . .'90 when He assumed His human body. The remaining unusual features in the Mérode Annunciation find their explanation, likewise, through the text of the Canticle. Panofsky has noticed that the lions on the bench bring to mind Solomon's throne but correctly refrained from making such an identification91. For one person's throne, the seat is much too long, cf. the Aix Madonna and Hermitage Trinity 92. On the other hand, the alternative that the bench is 'misdrawn' since Campin did not know enough about perspective is, like Cézanne's eye disease, a myth disproven by the facts. When Campin's buildings and pieces of furniture are shown at right angle to the spectator they are all normal; besides, all his copyists would automatically fall also into the category 'ignorant in perspective,' which is improbable. The Song of Songs does not mention Solomon's throne, yet it speaks of his bridal couch (I, 15). Identifying the bench with this, its length finds an explanation. It is rendered as a bench because it typifies also the seat for the Virgin and Christ in Mary's Coronation (Fig. 14)93, which represents the fulfilment of the union at the end of days, inaugurated at the Annunciation. To indicate that the Madonna's exaltation in the Coronation will take place in the future, she is seated below, not upon, the bench. By giving this double meaning to the bench, Campin has drawn attention away from the erotic content of the symbol which is so unpleasantly present in paintings containing the Virgin's bed (cf. Fig. 3). Whether by acci- dent or design, the bench is placed next to the table, like the ecclesiastical seats next to the altar in early Christian and Byzantine churches94. As regards the inclusion of St. Joseph shown in the task of making traps, it is explained through the line II, 15 in the Canticle which contains the following invocation for help: 'Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines'95. Commentators identify the foxes with demons or heretics; Joseph is working toward the eradication of this pest of the Christian Vine96. Dürer, who also based his 89. 'Sante Pagnini and Michelangelo.

Whether or not the bench in the Italian Annunciations (cf. Fig. 15) and in the Werl altarpiece which has no animals as decoration (Panofsky 1953, Fig. 213) has symbolic significance and, if so, what its meaning is, must be studied within the context of these particular paintings. 94.

St. Bernard (Sermons LXIII-VI, Migne, P.L., CLXXXIII, cc. 1080.C-1102.B) identifies them with secret detractors and seductive adulators, temptations and clandestine heretics. 96. Schapiro had already interpreted the traps as instruments to 82</page><page sequence="19">woodcut of the Annunciation in the Life of the Virgin (1505-7) upon the Song of Songs, as is intimated by the lattice screen in the window, the wooden 'beams' inserted into the arches and 'rafters' applied to the vaults, introduced the fox in persona. It can be seen, chained to a hole under the steps down which Gabriel has just hurried with his message (Fig. 16)97. Since only one fox is shown, the animal may symbolize the arch heretic, i.e. the devil. Apparently Campin also refers to the devil himself in his altarpiece. Joseph is fabricating mice traps; as has been pointed out by Schapiro, the mouse is a symbol of Satan and of Eve's erotic love inspired by him 'little foxes' is equated with mice. Turning next to yet another iconographie feature of the Mérode Annunciation, the fact that the Virgin is seated, not standing, is dictated by the verse 'Arise, my love . . .' (Canticle, II, 10) and its repetition three lines later; her position upon the room's floor, signifying besides her pre-Coronation status, also her humility, makes this image particularly compelling; this position is unusual for a fif- teenth century Flemish Annunciate. Contrary to the stationary Sponsa, the Sponsus who looks through the windows is likened to '. . . a roe, or a young hart' which '. . . cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills' (Canticle, II, 9, 8), which corresponds to Campin's Infant in motion. The Mérode altarpiece sets the Annunciation into a room which embodies the specifications given in the Canticle for the wedding chamber, characterizes this wedding chamber as a shrine in accordance with the patristic exegesis, and depicts the Celestial Bridegroom as the light which enters through the chamber's windows, again in harmony with the reading of the Church Fathers. It illustrates several images of the Canticle as they were seen by the Catholic Divines, selecting motifs appropriate to the narrative when none are given, e.g. Joseph fighting the foes of Christ, and supplements the narrative with other motifs borrowed from the common store of Christian symbolism, e.g. the door re-opened to heaven and the undamaged glasspane. No further evidence is needed to assert that Campin's painting portrays the wedding of God with mankind as it was read into the text of the Song of Songs by the exegetes. Since every Coronation of the Virgin has to be understood as a wedding picture and reference to the Canticle, the question arises whether the same would not be true of every Annunciation. I am not qualified to answer this question. But I believe that the symbolism found in the Mérode altarpiece cannot automatically be transferred to other pictures. The meaning of each motif in any painting has to be studied individually, and then only can the total be added up. In the Mérode altarpiece this total shows that, symbolically, the painting forms a unity in its present state: all three panels illustrate one passage in the Canticle, viz. lines I, 16 to II, 15. Even in the original state, before the revision was effected, the Annunciation panel portrayed the Incarnation according to the Canticle, but what the situation in the donors' wing was at that time is anybody's catch the devil (1945, 182-3) but without reference to the Song of Songs; instead he adduces a passage from the writings of St. Augustine. 97.

That much is, however, certain: the revisions were tied to the symbolic content of the center panel. It seems probable that the symbolic program of the Mérode altarpiece was devised for the painter by an adviser. Yet, too much of the imagery created by the Church Fathers has been forgotten, and too little is known about the anonymous artists of the middle ages to tell in which points Robert Campin would have needed help in his task to represent the sacred theme of Christ's marriage to mortal flesh according to Canticle exegesis. N.B. Since writing the above two valuable iconographie studies on the Mérode altarpiece have ap- peared, clarifying the meaning further: William S. Heckscher, 'The Annunciation of the Mérode Altarpiece,' Miscellanea Jozef Duverger, I, Ghent, 1968, pp. 37-65 and Charles Ilsley Minott, 'The Theme of the Mérode Altarpiece,' The Art Bulletin, LI, 1969, pp. 267-271. Professor Heckscher' s article touches on the symbolism of the windows but the problem is marginal to his argument. Minott's tracing of the ax, saw and rod in the panel with Joseph, and the burning flax in the hand of the Annun- ciate, to Isaiah (X, 15) is convincing. I cannot follow him, however, in the interpretation of the central panel as an image of the Advent rather than the Incarnation. 98. The differences between the Annunciation and donor panels are admirably discussed in Mojmír S. Frinta, The Genius of Robert Cam- pin , The Hague 1966, 13-28, Idem , 'The Authorship of the Merode Altarpiece', Art Quarterly , XXXI (1968) 247-265. Compositionally, the altarpiece is also a unity; there are a series of Italian Annunciations which have the same structural skeleton of a landscape at the left and room at the right (cf. Fig. 15). This fact needs emphasizing because, stylistically, the left panel is constructed in a different way: stylisti- cally, the altarpicce's uniformity is broken. 84</page></plain_text>
