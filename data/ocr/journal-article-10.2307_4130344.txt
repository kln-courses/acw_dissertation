What kind of creatures are werewolves, wild boys, and homicidal pigs? Are they real or mere representations? Are they best understood as lapsed humans or advanced animals? What is at stake in such determinations? These and other questions are explored by Erica Fudge in Perceiving Animals: Humans and Beasts in Early Modern English Culture, a well-researched and provocative study that offers an extended exploration of the "animality of humanity" in British thought from the late sixteenth to early seventeenth century. Taking the practice of bear-baiting in the London Bear Garden as its point of departure, Perceiving Animals argues that the representation of animals repeatedly revealed the inca- pacity of human beings to inhabit their humanity. In such violent and disturb- ing practices as cockfighting, monkey-baiting, vivisection, and bestiality, the slippage between human and animal states was fully manifested. Yet it was also the case that they owed their very popularity to their ability to illuminate that conceptual barrier. Animals cannot speak in words, and their history is therefore necessarily represented by humans. To her credit, Fudge takes the anthropomorphic pro- jection and is careful not to naively recapitulate its stance. Nonetheless, by virtue of writing about animals, a degree of anthropocentrism is necessarily rehearsed. (The autistic scientist Temple Grandin is perhaps the unique case of a human who is able, on some level, to translate the perspective of animals; it is not unimportant that she argues that animals "think" in non-linear pic- tures.) In Fudge's hands, animals are primarily creatures of words, and texts are her primary sources of evidence. Her work offers few visual images, the analyses of which are weakly contextualized and partial. Instead, using period sources, following a trajectory from Aesop to Ben Jonson, she demonstrates that the use of language has been used to differentiate human and beasts, and the writing of their history thus remains a manifestly human activity. She es- capes the reductive man-animal binarism by repeatedly demonstrating how the very state of "human-ness," conceived philosophically and not taxonomically, was repeatedly challenged, revised, and reconfigured by the mundane proxim- ity of beasts to humans in the early Modern period. Chapter One begins with bear-baiting, arguing that the activity offered the entertaining possibility of demonstrating man's dominion over beasts, whereby even the most pitiful individuals could temporarily feel powerful by virtue of this hierarchy. At the same time, however, the audience's delight in this cruel activity revealed the "animal that lurks beneath the [hominid] surface": the uncivilized practice dehumanized spectators simply because they were looking. This uniquely human capacity for denigration leads into Chapter Two, which interrogates the thorny matter of conscience. In one of the most interesting ?

Shape no longer offered a reliable index of the human condition. As visible markers of difference became increasingly suspect, the denotative capacity for language was refined into degrees of "eloquence." As explored in Chapter Three, the determination of eloquence was a matter of interpretation, and was thus deeply embedded inside a humanist matrix which merely served to confuse things. The rise of skepticism is further explored in Chapter Four, which pursues the proto-scientific excavation of the animal anatomy as a way to see beyond the Renaissance theatre of appearances. Chapter Five invokes the legal status of animals, both as property held under a system of legal classification (as "wild," "domestic" and "other") and as actors capable of committing crimes for which they were routinely placed on trial. Perhaps because of the clarity offered by the legal structure itself, as well as the solid secondary scholarship document- ing this particular aspect of animal history, this chapter is particularly convinc- ing. Chapter Six focuses on the writing of Richard Overton and the politics of animal representation. In this crucial chapter, Fudge introduces Overton's argument for a history of animals that does not take man as its measure. Yet though Overton recognized "the animal as an animal, important in and of itself," the animal was used as a political tool, and was still a passive subject rather than an active agent. Fudge's Epilogue acknowledges Overton's own embarrassed admission that he "love[d] the sport" of bear baiting, closing the circle by returning to the contested arena that prompted her to initiate this inquiry. In the end, Overton's failure to escape his own cultural conditions is an indirect reminder to readers to consider their own attitudes to the animals described in this fascinating history. Throughout Perceiving Animals, Fudge largely avoids the Cartesian stand- points that dominated the de animalibus debates on the Continent. Instead, the dualistic framework of modern corporeality is explored in an anthology, edited by Fudge, Ruth Gilbert, and Susan Wiseman, At the Borders of the Human: Beasts, Bodies and Natural Philosophy in the Early Modern Period. Moving beyond the British debates to offer additional case studies in Europe and the New World, this anthology ranges across geographical boundaries in order to reveal the fragility of the human condition. This collection of twelve essays offers a range of solid scholarship that examines "boundary practices" such as midwifery and pornography, along with hybrid creatures that challenge prevailing systems of order, such as hermaphrodites and cyborgs. The wild boy, the anthropomor- phic ape, and the bestialized woman also make an appearance, their treat- ments by Michael Newton, Susan Wiseman, and Mary Peace offering interest- ing comparisons to the discussion of such characters by Fudge in her monograph. The contrast demonstrates the importance of historical specificity precisely because their meaning is not fixed; inside the modern imagination, the figure of the ape is always in the background, but it is also always changing. These essays are very dense, and in some cases difficult to read, in part because of the rapidity which with they move from the familiarities of "huntying &amp; hauking dysyng &amp; cardyng etyng &amp; drynkyng&amp; in conclusion in al vayn pleas- ure pastime &amp; vanyte," to the problem of "caeteri homines"-other men-in the next breath.

In that very constriction, however, it becomes clear how much more can be said, and how much more work needs to be done. The history of animals is just begin- ning to be written.
