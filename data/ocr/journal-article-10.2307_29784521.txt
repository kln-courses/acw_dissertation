<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Blarsted Niggers!": The Emperor Jones and Modernism's Encounter with Africa Gabriele Poole Universita' La Sapienza, Rome ritical responses to The Emperor Jones differ widely on a number of crucial points. While most critics agree that the play contrasts two discourses?one associated with modern white Western civilization, and the other associated with the natives (for brevity, we shall refer to them as "white discourse" and "black discourse")?critics disagree on the exact nature of these discourses, the prestige they enjoy in the text, and the protagonist's position with regard to them. Although I believe that the relative merits of these positions can be profitably discussed to some extent through a careful analysis of the play, I also feel that this variety of responses is due to the ambivalent nature of the drama, and particularly to the fact that neither discourse is clearly privileged. Furthermore, this complexity is also diachronically articulated, in the sense that the way these discourses are presented shifts significantly during the play, suggesting the need for a dynamic rather than a static analysis of the text. In the first part of this study, I intend to concentrate on one of the issues critics disagree mostly on: the way Jones himself is situated in regard to the two aforementioned discourses. I shall first examine his initial position through an analysis of the play's first scene, and then proceed to discuss the shifts that occur in his position throughout the play. In doing this I shall also broaden my focus to include the way the two discourses are pitted one against the other and the way the conflict is (not) resolved at the end. I shall pay particular attention to the metatextual relationship between black discourse and the play's expressionistic form, along with the related question of verbal/ univocal language versus non-verbal/connotational language. In the end I shall relate my analysis to the larger context of the encounter between Modernism and African culture, one aspect of which was the use of African culture as a stimulus for the renovation of artistic language. * * *</page><page sequence="2">22 The Eugene O'Neill Review As we have noted, one of the questions critics have most disagreed about in the past is Jones's position in relation to white and black discourse. Some critics maintain that his defeat at the hands of the natives is determined by his inability to effectively emulate modern civilized white man, an inability which in turn is caused by his savage black cultural background. Leech describes Jones as an "ignorant and conceited negro who has picked up the smart devices of the white man" (37); Cooley describes him as an "'uppity' black man who presumed to model himself after successful white exploiters" (77), the whole play being infected by the racist stereotype of black atavism. Bogard seconds Cooley's position, arguing that the play's basic message is that it is "the Negro who is essentially uncivilized, wearing contemporary sophistications as a loosely fitting mask over an incorrigibly savage countenance" (139). Critics like Chabrowe and T?rnqvist, on the other hand, have argued that Jones stands for Western civilization in general, his failure to escape the forest symbolizing its inability to understand itself fully and to acknowledge its more hidden compulsions. While the play is certainly influenced by the stereotype of black atavism, I feel that the first position is problematized by two factors. First, Jones's position with regard to the discourse of white civilization is in many ways one of successful identification, rather than unsuccessful parody. Second, in no way does the play simply equate black discourse with atavistic and barbarous beliefs. Indeed, as we shall see, there is a strong metatextual relation between this discourse and the expressionistic form in which the play itself is cast, a fact which obviously enhances its prestige. On the other hand, it is obvious that Jones's racial identification with black discourse problematizes his relationship to white discourse. Thus, the external conflict between black and white discourse is paralleled by, and to some degree coincides with, an internal psychological conflict within Jones himself. After an exotic equivalent of the conventional "maid-scene" that provides expository information, Jones enters the scene. The stage directions endow him with superior characteristics: he is "tall, powerfully-built," his face expresses "an underlying strength of will, a hardy, self-reliant confidence in himself that inspires respect." His eyes "are alive with a keen, cunning intelligence" (1033).1 His appearance is contrasted with that of Smithers, who, although tall, is "stoop-shouldered" and has a "bald head, perched on a long neck with an enormous Adam's apple [which] looks like an egg," combined with a yellow face, a nose which the native rum has rendered a "startling red," and "red-rimmed ... ferret's" eyes, his general expression being one of "unscrupulous meanness, cowardly and dangerous" (1031). Although Jones's ostentatious apparel and the grandeur with which he plays</page><page sequence="3">Gabriele Poole 23 his Emperor role may doubtless appear ridiculous, I do not feel that this reflects on the character, as Cooley suggests (76), insofar as its adoption is largely due to utilitarian reasons, as Jones's own comments make clear: You didn't s'pose I was holdin' down dis Emperor job for de glory in it, did you? Sho'! De fuss and glory part of it, dat's only to turn de heads o' de low-flung bush niggers dat's here. Dey wants de big circus show for deir money. I gives it to 'em an' gits de money. (1035) The whole second part of the first scene can be viewed as a struggle between Smithers and Jones for a position of psychological superiority. Using Frye's terminology, we can say that Smithers assumes the mask of the eiron, the ironic character, and tries to prove Jones to be an alazon, "someone who pretends or tries to be something more than he is" (39). If he were to succeed, Jones would indeed turn out to be a ridiculous figure, given that "the contest of eiron and alazon forms the basis of ... comic action" (172). Smithers makes sarcastic remarks, insinuating that Jones's success is due to luck, that Jones is boasting of a power he doesn't actually possess, that he has been influenced by the superstitions of the natives, and so on. But Jones is always two steps ahead of him, always ready to rebut Smithers' insinuations. He convincingly argues that his success is due to his superior capabilities; he shows that he is aware of the precarious nature of his position; he shows that he hasn't been taken in by the local witch-doctors, his compliance with their religious rituals being only a way to gain consensus among the population. In fact, he appears to be a shrewd politician whose power derives less from brute force than from an hegemonic position, acquired through his effective manipulation of local culture. This doesn't mean, however, that he is unable to resort to violence if necessary: when the exasperated Smithers loses his temper and insults him, Jones's grazing of his revolver or simply an ominous allusion is enough to push him back into his servile attitude. Jones does boast more than once of his achievements: "From stowaway to Emperor in two years! Dat's goin' some!" (1035). However, his career is indeed somewhat impressive, and Smithers' reaction confirms this impression: when Jones again says how he "winds up Emperor in two years," Smithers, as the stage directions inform us, is "unable to repress the genuine admiration of the small fry for the large," and replies: "Yes, yer turned the bleedin' trick, all right" (1035). In any case, as I noted earlier, Jones's pride doesn't prevent him from being aware of the precariousness of his position: "I ain't no fool. I knows dis Emperor's time is sho't" (1037). Jones's self-awareness, however, is temporarily challenged by his initial</page><page sequence="4">24 The Eugene O'Neill Review failure to realize that "dis Emperor's time" is actually already up, that the palace has been abandoned and the revolution is currently under way. Throughout their verbal skirmishes, Smithers' awareness of the immediate situation, as opposed to Jones's ignorance, is his strongest asset, enabling him to hold his ground in his and the audience's view, by uttering a number of sarcastic allusions to this fact, which Jones is unable correctly to interpret. By delaying to inform Jones that the revolution is under way, Smithers has set a rhetorical trap for Jones in which he falls squarely every time he boasts of his position; most evidently when he says, "Oh, I'se good for six months yit 'fore dey git sick o' my game" (1037), each time giving the impression that Smithers may perhaps be right in insinuating that he is an alazon figure. When Smithers finally tells Jones that "the bloody ship is sinking and the bleedin' rats 'as slung their 'ooks" (1039), Jones, who has just tried summoning his subjects, loses control, flings the useless bell away, and angrily cries: "Low-flung, woods' niggers!" (1039). In their psychological struggle for superiority, this is Smithers' high point, the only moment when Jones is actually caught unprepared. However, he quickly regains at least partial control of himself and the situation by laughingly admitting he has "overplayed [his] hand dis once," and rapidly readjusting his plans on the basis of this new information. The psychological success of his rhetorical strategy is confirmed by Smithers' reaction. He exclaims "with real admiration," "Blimey, but you're a cool bird, and no mistake" (1039). His success is definitively established when we discover that the revolution hasn't found him unprepared, his escape having been planned and arranged a long time ahead. Jones's pride, then, is not the ridiculous conceit of a fool, as some critics maintain, but rather the hubris of the tragic hero whose superiority is indisputable despite, and perhaps thanks to, his limitations. Jones can actually be very well read as a Nietzschean superman, at least the vulgarized version common at the beginning of the century.2 His pride in his superior capabilities is coupled with a strong contempt for other people, and he proclaims his indifference to moral laws, which, he says, apply only to lesser beings: "Ain't I de Emperor? De laws don't go for him" (1035). And he is independent of both white and black social orders, as suggested by his having murdered both a white and a black man. One should note, however, that his individualism does not position him in the same way with regard to the two collectivities. In the case of white collectivity, his attitude, apart from being justified to a certain extent by the violence of white society towards him, seems consistent with the individualistic and superficially materialistic values of that same collectivity. Actually, it's precisely through contact with loftier members of that society that he has</page><page sequence="5">Gabriele Poole 25 elaborated his views. The point is made rather neatly by Jones himself: Dere's little stealin' like you does, and dere's big stealin' like I does. For de little stealin' dey gits you in jail soon or late. For de big stealin' dey makes you Emperor and puts you in de Hall o' Fame when you croaks, (reminiscently) If dey's one thing I learns in ten years on de Pullman ca's listenin' to de white quality talk, it's dat same fact. (1035) Thus, in many ways Jones is less primitive at heart, "wearing contemporary sophistications as a loosely fitting mask over an incorrigibly savage countenance" (Cooley 139), than a successful embodiment of that contemporary civilization's ideology. The main opposition is thus between white discourse, represented by Jones, and the discourse of the native community. Yet, of course, Jones shares with the native community a common ancestry and oppressed condition; and although he refused to acknowledge these bonds, they are embedded in his mind. Thus the opposition between these discourses is also internal, and it is the latter conflict rather than the former which is dramatized in the forest scenes. Before leaving the first scene, I would like to discuss briefly the episode of the silver bullet, which has great symbolic importance in the play. Jones's contempt for the "low-flung bush niggers" whom he dominates and exploits is directed particularly toward their "superstitious" beliefs. It is through the cunning manipulation of these "superstitions" that Jones has been able to "take de pot on a bob-tailed flush" (1039)?that is, to gain control over the natives despite his lack of material power. When, two years previously, a native had tried to kill him and his gun accidently misfired, Jones exploited the accident by convincing the natives that he is invulnerable to anything but silver bullets. And he has reinforced their belief by casting for himself a silver bullet and telling the natives that "when de time comes I kills myself wid it" (1036). Previous criticism has indicated various ideas associated with the silver bullet?as a symbol of white civilization, of Jones's violence, and of Jones's fate. In the light of the above analysis, another meaning becomes even more prominent: that of Jones's autonomy. When Smithers forces him to take into account the possibility of his failing to escape, Jones confirms what he had said earlier: "I'se got five lead bullets in dis gun good enuff fo' common bush niggers?and after dat I got de silver bullet left to cheat 'em out o' gittin' me" (1041). The silver bullet stands, therefore, for Jones's ultimate refusal to submit to any form of social sanction, by choosing, if necessary, to kill himself in order to make his life remain up to the very last moment the concretization of his own individual will.</page><page sequence="6">26 The Eugene O'Neill Review Having discussed Jones's initial relation to these fundamental discourses, I would like to explore further the way the two are articulated. White discourse and black discourse are spatially and temporally distinct throughout the play, constituting, in fact, two separate worlds. The first world is characterized both materially and metaphorically by the color white. It is the white of white society, with its values of individualism and superficial materialism; it is the white of daylight, and it is the white of the walls and tiles of Jones's palace. This world is governed by rationality, individualism and the ability to exert physical violence. Jones possesses all three in high degree and is therefore the Emperor of this world, while the "superstitions" of the natives are a hindrance to rational action and determine their subordinate position, as the silver bullet episode demonstrates.3 Then there is another world, characterized by the color black. This is the color of the natives' skin, of night, and of the dark forest through which Jones tries to escape. This world is characterized by "superstitions," irrationality, dreaming and the unconscious. Jones's "white" hubris has caused him to treat the black world as irrelevant, an easy prey to his "white" capabilities. He has tried to be Emperor in this area of experience as well; he "has taken up with [the] witch-doctors" (1042) and has made himself venerated as a god. He has failed to acknowledge it as something outside his experience, something where he is the "primitive" and the natives are the "civilized" ones. And he displays the same attitude toward the forest: he has treated it as an object which can be apprehended on the basis of "white" skills; and after having been there many times he thinks he now "knows it high an' low like a book" (1040, my emphasis). But as the following scenes reveal, the black world of the forest cannot be mapped out and fixed on a page since it is not ordered according to the rational rules that Jones is familiar with. As we shall see, Jones turns out to be unable to correctly read the forest, and this inability is what dooms him at the end. During the two years previous to the play's start, white discourse has dominated the black one; but from the start of the play the balance of power has been gradually shifting from the former to the latter. However, the fact that Jones has to resign "dis Emperor job" to someone else has little to do with this contrast. This kind of event is to be expected in the white world, and had in fact been predicted by Jones long before. Instead, the conflict which is given prominence in the play is the one that occurs in Jones's mind: the question whether his "white" capabilities will prevail over the natives' magic spells and get him through the forest. Therefore, the first sign of an alteration in the balance of power is not so much the news that the revolution has started, but the "strange look of apprehension" which appears in Jones's</page><page sequence="7">Gabriele Poole 27 face when the tom-tom first starts thumping faintly in the distance (1041). In Scene Two, Jones arrives at a clearing at the edge of the "Great Forest." It is dusk, and we are thus both temporally and spatially close to the "black" world. The fact that the forest constitutes a border of some kind is clearly indicated by the stage direction: "In the rear the forest is a wall of darkness dividing the world" (1044). Jones experiences a growing uneasiness on account of the forest and the tom-tom, but fights it back, explaining it away as a reaction to hunger. The thought reassures him; but when he is unable to find the food he had previously hidden under a white rock, he panics, frantically overturning one white stone after another. He then notices that there are many white rocks around instead of the one he remembered and "mutters in a bewildered voice " "How come all dese white stones come heah when I only remembers one?" (1045), a phrase which he repeats a few lines later. The white stone that Jones had established as a sign to find his food can be seen as part of his effort to turn the forest into a "book"; in other words, to organize it according to a codified and univocal system of signs, a logical language, in order to make it readable and interpretable. This language is metaphorically identified with verbal language, particularly written language, as the metaphor of the book suggests, although from a practical point of view it does not always coincide with it.4 Verbal, and particularly written language, partakes, along with rationality in general, of white discourse, as one of the many cultural instruments of colonial domination.5 As we shall see, this aspect of verbal language is opposed to other, more connotative and symbolic forms of communication associated with black discourse?for example, the visual and auditory signs found in the forest scenes, and the Witch-Doctor's dance in Scene Seven. Returning to Scene Two, we should note that the color of the stone indicates from the start its inappropriateness as a sign to use in the black forest. In general, the failure of Jones's effort to mark his hiding place corresponds to the inability of ordinary, logical language, with its univocal relationships between signifier and signified, to express the connotative character of black language. It is also interesting to note that the white stone hasn't simply disappeared; it has been replaced by many others. The numerous white stones, coupled with the darkness and the moaning of the wind, clearly suggest the sepulchral atmosphere of a graveyard. They also suggest a hallucination which fragments and multiplies reality, thus constituting a prelude to the appearance of other hallucinations later on. Finally, they suggest a conscious effort to confuse Jones on the part of the forest itself, which the moaning of the wind has</page><page sequence="8">28 The Eugene O'Neill Review already begun to endow with the anthropomorphic characteristics it will more explicitly assume in the following scenes. From this point of view, the stones' multiplication looks very much like a parody of Jones's effort to give meaning to the forest. In place of one signifier, the forest offers myriads; but this, of course, undermines the univocal relationship between signifier and signified, and the information Jones needs is lost in a Babelic chaos. Jones senses this anthropomorphic presence in the forest and tries to reassure himself, defiantly exclaiming: "Woods, is you tryin' to put somethin' ovah on me?" (1046). But again, and more explicitly, the "black" world derides his hubris through the "tiny gale of low mocking laughter" which comes from the "little formless fears" which have been coming out of the forest unnoticed by him. From this clearing Jones departs on a circular journey through the forest, at the end of which he will find himself in exactly the same place he started. For T?rnqvist, "Jones' circular movement through the black forest is a journey back to his racial 'childhood'" ("Strindberg" 240), and he also mentions several possible meanings for the play's circular pattern. To these, I would add another, which I find particularly relevant in this case: namely, the somewhat obvious fact that the circular pattern corresponds to the experience of falling asleep, dreaming of places far away in time and space, and then reawakening in the same place and (approximately) same time. In the case of The Emperor Jones, the dreamy?or, rather, nightmarish?connotations of the circular pattern are further reinforced by two facts. The first is that Jones sets out into the forest at dusk to re-emerge from it at dawn. The second is that he departs from a relatively realistic situation in the palace, characterized among other things by the presence of Smithers as a symbol of the realistic white world; then enters the oneiric black forest; and finally returns to a realistic situation, again characterized by the presence of Smithers, when his body is dragged to the clearing at the end. Aside from the presence of a circular pattern, dream characteristics are evident in the scenes which take place in the forest. As previous criticism has already underscored, Jones meets figures which embody his past personal and racial experience. These figures are obviously related to his own conscience. More specifically, they can be seen as projections of his personal and collective unconscious, expressing Jones's guilt feelings for the wrongs he committed against specific individuals and against his race. What is difficult to interpret in a univocal way is how Jones relates to them, since the text gives us a number of messages leading to different and sometimes conflicting, even opposite conclusions. Correspondingly, we can find one line of interpretation, endorsed by critics like Falk, Floyd and T?rnqvist in A Drama of Souls, which</page><page sequence="9">Gabriele Poole 29 sees Jones's wandering in the forest as a process through which he gradually discovers his true self, realizes the racial ties which ethically bind him to the natives, and finally achieves atonement through his death. Clearly, some evidence supports this view. Jones's repentance is suggested by his prayers, and some sort of identification with the natives is suggested by his joining in the slaves' wailing in the ship scene and his gradually divesting himself of his robes, which finally leaves him naked except for his pants, which are so ragged they are "no better than a breech cloth" (1055), clearly an equivalent of the loin cloth of the natives. However, one can hardly consider the two scenes where Jones reenacts the killing of Jeff and the prison guard as the symbolic equivalent of realizing his guilt and expiating it. When Jones "jerks out his revolver in a frenzy of rage" and says, "Nigger, I kills you dead once. Has I got to kill you ag'in? You take it den," and shoots at Jeff's "ha'nt," the scene can only be seen as Jones's failure to come to terms with his guilt and his resorting to the same violence and hubris which had made him commit those homicides in the first place. (On this subject, see note seven.) Jones's prayers undoubtedly show that he repents, but one must keep in mind that his prayers are in a sense addressed to the wrong god, since the Christian God partakes in the discourse of white civilization, and is directly opposed to the religious beliefs of the natives. This opposition is present not only in the first scene but also in those that follow; for example, in Scene Four, where Jones tells himself: "Ha'nts! You fool nigger, dey ain't no such things! Don't de Baptist parson tell you dat many time? Is you civilized, or is you like dese ign'rent black niggers heah?" (1049). Also, when Jones prays he doesn't simply ask God to forgive him; instead, he asks Him to keep the "ha'nts" away from him, the same end he tries to achieve by using his gun. Both the God he prays to and his gun are therefore connected to white discourse, and are used to repress and keep at bay the black one?not to understand, and even less to embrace it. Bogard says that the characters Jones meets in the forest can be seen as either projections of his mind or, alternatively, the "ha'nts" which the natives have sent after him. In fact, it can be argued that the two alternatives coincide, inasmuch as the play suggests that the native witch-doctors, through their superior knowledge of the black world, and hence of man's unconscious side, are somehow able to manipulate Jones's latent guilt feelings in order to punish him for his sins. In his insightful discussion of Jones, C.W.E. Bigsby draws our attention to the relationship between "superstition" and psychology by reminding us that Freud has described superstition as "nothing but psychology projected into the</page><page sequence="10">30 The Eugene O'Neill Review external world." However, Bigsby suggests that this is a pathological mechanism, the play being as much "a study of a paranoid individual as it is an observation about the psychopathology of a group" (57). The problem with this position is that we end up assuming an attitude toward the natives' "superstitions" not too different from that expressed in Smithers' final comment: And I s'pose you think it's yer bleedin' charms and yer silly beatin' the drum that made 'im run in a circle when 'e'd lost 'imself, don't yer.... Stupid as 'ogs, the lot of 'em! Blarsted niggers! (1104) But Smithers' comment, as Bigsby himself points out, "is a sign of his failure to understand what he has seen" (55). To understand what we have seen, it is useful to recall how this play has been praised for its effective use of expressionistic techniques. Expressionism is mainly characterized as the objectivation and dramatization of inner experiences, and the similarity with Freud's definition of superstition is obvious. Yet no one would define an individual as paranoid just because she or he happens to find expressionistic plays interesting. In short, it is possible to argue that, just as on a formal level Jones uses expressionistic techniques to explore certain realms of experience less permeable to more conventional techniques, on a thematic level it presents the natives' "superstitions" as a way for exploring those realms, a way to wisdom that is inaccessible to Jones or Smithers.6 Scene Seven is of central importance for our understanding of the play. It is clear that at this point Jones is torn between black and white worlds. On the one hand, he feels the impulse to give in to the mysterious forces that have been plaguing him ever since he arrived in the forest. His gradual giving in to the black world is shown by his joining in the slaves' wailing in Scene Six, the ship scene (as opposed to his violent reaction at the end of earlier episodes), and by the fact that at the end of Scene Six "the tom-tom beats louder, quicker, with a more insistent, triumphant pulsation" (1056). At the beginning of Scene Seven it is evident that Jones's state of mind is closer to the visionary "black" world than to the rational white one, and that he is almost ready to submit to the mysterious forces which he had previously fought against: "The expression of his face is fixed and stony, his eyes have an obsessed glare, he moves with a strange deliberation like a sleep-walker or one in trance." He sees an altar made of boulders and "as if in obedience to some obscure impulse, he sinks into a kneeling, devotional posture" in front of it (1057). At this moment his "white" side takes over, he "seems to come to</page><page sequence="11">Gabriele Poole 31 himself partly " gets up, and says: "What?what is I doin'? What is?dis place?" At this point the Witch-Doctor springs out and commences his dance. T?rnqvist argues that this seventh scene is, like the previous ones, a product of Jones's imagination and, more specifically, that the crocodile (like all the other visions) is a projection of himself. This interpretation enables him to argue that Jones's killing of the crocodile is not a sign of revolt against the forces of the black world, but on the contrary the killing of his old sinful self and hence a gesture of expiation (the same being true for Scenes Three and Four, where Jones "kills" two other "ha'nts"). While I agree that the "ha'nts" can be readily seen as projections of Jones's imagination, I see them as the personification of past memories and associated guilt feelings, rather than alter-egos.7 Furthermore, as far as Scene Seven is concerned, the situation is somewhat different inasmuch as there are a number of indicators that the scene should be read as "realistic." The presence of both the Witch Doctor and the crocodile can be realistically explained, unlike that of the characters found in the previous forest scenes. The Witch-Doctor's behavior is also different from the latter, all of which had moved in a rigid, unnatural way like automatons or marionettes (see pp. 1047, 1050, 1053), the suggestion being that Jones is the puppet-player and the characters his own mental projections. In contrast, the Witch-Doctor moves in a normal way, and is also a very active figure, while it is Jones who assumes a passive attitude. Finally, while in the previous scenes the visions magically disappeared when Jones fired his gun, at the end of Scene Seven the Witch-Doctor "springs behind the sacred tree and disappears" and the "crocodile sinks back behind the river bank." This "realistic" interpretation, in fact, integrates Scene Seven quite logically into the rest of the plot, without undermining the idea that the other forest scenes occur in Jones's imagination. The Witch-Doctor's dance visually re-enacts Brutus Jones's flight. The pantomime can be seen as directly opposed to Jones's effort to codify the "black" world as a "book." Instead of verbal, rational "white" language, the Witch-Doctor offers a non-verbal language akin to the language of the unconscious and to that of expressionistic theatre. As Bigsby points out, The collapse of language creates rather than destroys meaning. All the images from the past are presented in mime. The process of pressing back into the past towards pre-history is a process of dispensing with language. It is also presented as a move towards truth?simultaneously a Freudian and a theatrical assertion of the primacy of non-verbal communication. (56) As in the case of the slaves' wailing, Jones is subjugated by non-verbal</page><page sequence="12">32 The Eugene O'Neill Review language and begins to chant and rock along with the Witch-Doctor. Then "the theme of the pantomime halts on a howl of despair, and is taken up again in a note of savage hope. There is a salvation. The forces of evil demand sacrifice" (1058). It is Jones himself who must offer himself in sacrifice. Jones is terrorized and moans, "Mercy, Oh Lawd! Mercy! Mercy on dis po' sinner." At this point the crocodile appears from the water and the conflict between "white" and "black" forces increases in intensity, mounting toward its climax. The ascendent progression is created by the tom-tom, which "beats madly" \ by the Witch-Doctor, who "shrills out in furious exultation"; and by Jones wriggling "nearer and nearer" to the crocodile (1058). The ascendent progression of the "white" forces, instead, is marked by Jones's triple invocation to God, the last being "a fierce, exhausted spasm of anguished pleading": "Lawd, save me! Lawd Jesus, heah my prayer!" For the moment, the conflict is resolved in favor of the "white" forces: {Immediately, in answer to his prayer, comes the thought of the one bullet left him. He snatches at his hip, shouting defiantly): De silver bullet! You don't git me yit! (1059) Jones shoots the silver bullet, the crocodile sinks into the waters, the Witch-Doctor disappears behind a tree and "the throb of the tom-tom fills the silence ... with a somber pulsation, a baffled but revengeful power" (1059). One of the problems which this penultimate scene poses is what to make of the "salvation" that the Witch-Doctor proposes to Jones. Even while not agreeing with T?rnqvist's and other critics' interpretations, according to which Jones repents and is saved in the end, it would be possible to argue that the sacrifice which Jones refuses would have enabled him to come to terms with his unconscious guilt feelings and the "black" community, thus achieving a final atonement through his sacrifice. I think the play does suggest this interpretation?up to Scene Seven. Until then, violence has always been directed from Jones towards the black world, while Jones's praying suggests the possibility of a final redemption. Yet, as we have seen, the realistic character of the seventh scene makes it difficult to interpret the Witch-Doctor and the crocodile's demonic connotations as simply the product of Jones's distorted imagination. And the sacrifice here required is so horrible that it is very difficult to endow it with positive connotations. Jones is totally horrified by the prospect of his sacrifice; and his horror cannot be attributed simply to his fear of death, since this would not be consistent with the character. Furthermore, he is not asked to perform the sacrifice willingly, as a symbol of his repentance; but, on the</page><page sequence="13">Gabriele Poole 33 contrary, it is imposed on him through a hypnotic process whose aim is to deprive him of any autonomous will. The sacrifice, then, cannot be interpreted as a symbolical equivalent of a personal growth enabling him to come to terms with the black discourse; but on the contrary as the surrendering of his freedom and the disintegration of his autonomous self. Thus, the "salvation" offered him by the Witch-Doctor appears to be the final touch to the manipulation and revengeful persecution to which he has been subject, and not an effort to redeem him of his sins. In this crucial scene, therefore, there is an important shift in the black discourse, which results in its ethical devaluation. Non-verbal language partakes in this devaluation. Up to here it is possible to maintain, as does Bigsby, that only language (which Bigsby uses as a synonym for verbal language) is the "agent of exploitation" and that "at the level of [verbal] language lies are possible; at the level of instinctual behavior, of gesture, and of unconscious impulse there is an available truth" (55-56). Yet in this scene, where the black world becomes dominant, non-verbal language takes the place of verbal language as the dominant group's instrument of manipulation and oppression. What the play ends up expressing, then, is not only a lack of faith in the possibility of reconciling modern Western man with black discourse, but a distrust of black discourse itself. For Jones, as we have seen, the black world remains an alien and horrifying Other. The main point, however, is that this is ultimately true of the play in general, since in Scene Seven Jones's horror is justified to a large extent by the way the black world is presented. Incidentally, even the "narrator" of the play (if we may so define the perspective found in the stage directions) shares Jones's "white" perspective, inasmuch as the mysterious powers of the black world are defined as the "forces of evil." For Jones, then, there is no possible salvation, and the only acceptable alternative for him is to hang on to his hubris to the end, defiantly shooting his last bullet. Jones's shooting of his silver bullet can be seen as contradicting his original intent to use it on himself when everything was lost. It is also what dooms him, since the silver bullet is his "rabbit foot," and by shooting it he seals his doom. But this should not lead us to think that what appears as a victory in this scene is actually his final defeat. In Scene Seven, the forces of the "black" world, whose power over Jones had steadily grown till then, obviously suffer a check, and their original goal, Jones's submission and sacrifice, is not accomplished. And, as we have already noted, what is at stake in the conflict between Jones and the black world is not so much Jones's death as his individual freedom and the integrity of his self. In this sense, the</page><page sequence="14">34 The Eugene O'Neill Review silver bullet does entirely perform the original function Jones attributed to it?the preservation of his individuality against the forces of collectivity. When Jones emerges from the woods, he is killed; but this is the material death he is willing to accept. And he is killed with silver bullets that symbolically equate with his own silver bullet, thus reinforcing the impression of an heroic death, as Smithers' concluding comments make clear (1061). The play's ambivalence with regard to white and black discourse is also evident in its publishing history. In the 1924 edition of the play, O'Neill decided to cut Smithers' last lines. The main reason may have been that they sounded overdidactic; yet it is interesting to note that, whereas the ending of the first version emphasized the blind arrogance of the white world and its inability to acknowledge the relevance of the black discourse, the new version moves closer to the "white" individualistic ethos by emphasizing the other aspect of the opposition, namely Jones's tragic greatness, since the curtain line becomes Smithers' epitaph for Jones: "Silver bullets! Gawd blimey, but yer died in the 'eighth o' style, any'ow!" (1061). * * * In conclusion, I would like to note how the ambivalence exemplified in The Emperor Jones is also part of Modernism at large. In Modernism, as the authors of The Empire Writes Back observe, the encounter with Africa seems on the one hand "to inspire the modernists and encourage them in their attempts to create the images of an alternative and radically 'unrealistic' art." On the other, this attitude "was accompanied by a more radical, fearful, and complex vision in which 'primitive' art was seen as expressive of the 'other side' of the European, civilized psyche, the 'dark' side of man. This is the fear which is expressed in such works as Conrad's Heart of Darkness" (156). It is known that Heart of Darkness was one of the works which most influenced O'Neill in creating The Emperor Jones, another being Strindberg's To Damascus} It is also through the influence of these two works that The Emperor Jones ends up combining both of the attitudes towards Africa outlined above, thus becoming a striking example of Modernism's ambivalence. Schematizing, we may say that The Emperor Jones takes from To Damascus its expressionistic form and, thanks to its analogy with it, the black world is metatextually legitimated as a superior mode of knowledge. On the contrary, on a thematic level, the way the black world is presented in The Emperor Jones is analogous to that in Heart of Darkness?i.e., as threatening and alien. It is true that in Strindberg's play, too, the protagonist initially perceives the mysterious world he encounters as demonic. But this distorted view is</page><page sequence="15">Gabriele Poole 35 ironically undermined in his interactions with other "demonic" characters. Furthermore, he gradually reconsiders his view, and is able to find in this "other" world a source of self-knowledge and reconciliation with himself. In The Emperor Jones, instead, the protagonist's distorting gaze is not relativized to the character but is finally extended to the play as a whole. Thus the play is unable to break out of a reductive binary opposition between a petty and violent white world, and a mysterious, perhaps fascinating, but equally destructive black one, which remains irreducibly alien. The same impasse that characterizes Heart of Darkness, and the same attitude toward the black world expressed by Kurtz's last words: "The horror! The horror!" Notes 1. It is unclear whether an element of racist bias can be detected in the "yet" in this stage direction: "His features are typically negroid, yet there is something decidedly distinctive about his face" (1033). Both Cooley and Bogard read the "yet" as implying an opposition between "distinctive" and " negroid." I am in debt to Don Costello at the University of Notre Dame, however, for the suggestion that the word may simply be opposing "distinctive" and "typical." 2. That O'Neill was familiar with Nietzsche is well known. Not that a direct knowledge was in any way a prerequisite for the use of a stereotype much in vogue at the turn of the century. In fact, as Gramsci notes, "moltasedicente 'superumanit a' nicciana ha solo come origine e modello dottrinale non Zaratustra ma // Conte di Montecristo" (149). (Much self-defined Nietzschean "superhumanity" has its origin and doctrinal model not in Zarathustra but in The Count of Monte Cristo). From his perspective, too, O'Neill, as the son of James O'Neill, Sr., was in an excellent position to make a knowledgeable use of the stereotype (Sheaffer 36). 3. Jones does possess a white equivalent of the natives' superstitions?namely, his Christian beliefs; but he has an ironically detached attitude towards them (see, for example "with a chuckle" on p. 1042), which makes one doubt the earnestness of his faith (at least before the forest experiences). In any case, Jones's religious beliefs, unlike those of the natives, constitute in no way a restraint on his action, as he himself makes clear: "Fse after de coin, an' I lays my Jesus on de shelf for de time bein'" (1042). 4. For example, Jones's use of the stone as a sign obviously does not fall under the heading of verbal language. It does, however, possess the characteristic around which the play constructs the opposition between black and white language?namely, the logical and univocal character of the latter.</page><page sequence="16">36 The Eugene O'Neill Review 5. As is well known, in Of Grammatology, Derrida depicts oral language, or the privileging of oral language over written, as the hallmark of Western logocentric thought, whereas written language is presented as the means for a "play" with language, serving to block the drive for fixed meanings, and to overcome Western "ethnocentricism." From this point of view, the play's use of the metaphor of writing for a "white" Western logical univocal language would appear inappropriate. However, it is quite obvious that written language is intimately connected with the development of Western society. In fact, as John Ellis points out in Against De construction, "Derrida's account of the Western tradition?specifically, of its ethnocentricism and Saussure's participating in that ethnocentricism?reverses the historical situation and constitutes a major misunderstanding. Far from being a purveyor of the traditional ethnocentricism, Saussure opposed the ethnocentricism of Western linguists who had always paid too much attention to the texts and manuscripts of written language, to the detriment of oral speech. This traditional emphasis on written texts automatically involved a limited, ethnocentric perspective of language, since it restricted study to those cultures and languages with long written traditions, i.e. largely their own Western cultures" (19). As for the relationship between written language and rationality, even here Derrida's position appears to be problematic if considered against the background of the historical function of written language, particularly its role in the passage from paradigmatic (and oral) cultures to syntagmatic (and written) ones. 6. An elaborate and empirically grounded version of this interpretation of certain religious rites as techniques for objectifying and dealing with (unconscious) emotions is found in the fascinating studies of the Italian anthropologist Ernesto De Martino on magic rituals in Southern Italy and Rumania, particularly Morte e pianto rituale. 7. Even if we believe that the Crocodile God and the Witch-Doctor should or may be perceived as Jones's visions, T?rnqvist's idea that they should be read as Jones's alter egos would remain questionable. T?rnqvist's position appears to be influenced by Dahlstr?m's, for whom in classical expressionistic theatre all characters are mental projections of the protagonist, often interpreted in the restricted sense that they are all the protagonist's doppelgangers. However, I find this position unnecessarily rigid. A playwright can very well present a mental projection of the protagonist as the recollection of someone he knew?filtered, of course, by the protagonist's subjectivity ?just as one may dream of a person from one's past and endow it with psychological characteristics that do not necessarily belong to oneself. 8. The influence of To Damascus on The Emperor Jones was noted by Clara Blackburn as early as 1941. For a general discussion of the relationship between the two playwrights, see also Winther and T?rnqvist, "Strindberg."</page><page sequence="17">Gabriele Poole 37 Works Cited Bigsby, C. W. E.
