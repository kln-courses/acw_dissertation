<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMPRINTS OF THE AENEID ON PARADISE LOST By WILLARD CONNELY Cambridge, Mass. Was there ever anything so delightful as the music of Paradise Lost! It is like that of a fine organ; has the fullest and deepest tones of majesty, with all the softness and elegance of the Dorian flute. Variety without end and never equalled, unless perhaps by Virgil.--Cowper. Cowper makes a wise reservation; and is it too much to say that Milton learned chiefly from Virgil his music so varied? With the score of currents in literature which found a delta in Milton's mind it may be hazard to delimit the warmth of a single tributary. Sensibility here depends upon our degree of immersion. Yet even a "wading" knowledge of the Aeneid and of Paradise Lost would seem to disclose enough counterparts and enough resemb- lances in the architectonics of epic to enable us to grant Virgil's sway over the English poet a more deep-rooted factor than Cow- per, or even such a critic as Addison, would imply. Modern commentators are inclined to accord Milton a higher magnificence, a sublimity unattained by Virgil because the latter lacked the Christian tradition. By reason of sixteen hundred years' further development of human progress Milton to be sure was gainer, but this advantage by no means freed him from his Virgilian footing. Of the two men, Virgil reveals the mightier intellect. And had they been contemporaries, the Roman's superiority and his acceptance as a standard would very likely have been the more pronounced, for if in the Aeneid there is one thing that Virgil continuously proves, it is that he has the sagacity to adapt him- self to his times. Milton must have measured the dimensions of the Aeneid like a fussy old carpenter. True, his extension of Paradise Lost from ten books to twelve was an afterthought, but the less ex- 466</page><page sequence="2">IMPRINTS OF AENEID ON PARADISE LOST 467 ternal and more vital likenesses to Virgil he no doubt planned long before he began to write. We may cite the double purpose of both authors: in the Aeneid, the voyage to Latium and the con- quest of Latium; in Paradise Lost, the fall of Satan and the fall of man. Both writers leap in medias res at the start, disregarding chronology to get a dramatic opening, and at this point Milton was so dominated by his Virgil, whom he must have known almost by heart, that for fifty lines he follows the Latin form of invocation, (covering Aen. I, 1-33). While in the recording of events prior to the beginning of the poem Milton does not lead off until he is more than half through Book V, as compared to Virgil who takes up such matters in Books II and III, the method of treatment is identical. Adam and Eve are the entranced audi- tors of Raphael just as Dido and her court listen spellbound to Aeneas' narrative. Again, Milton learned, shall we say patterned, his propriety according to Virgil. In general the Englishman avoided humor, and at the same time he was able to avoid lowness or coarseness, indecorum or inelegance. But as if he desired to be not perfect, or as if he would quite rival the Latin in variety, he allowed an amusing glimpse of Eve as the solicitous housewife decking her table with dainties for Raphael, a distinguished guest; he permitted the evil spirits, notably Belial, proud of their artillery, to jest at the angels. Virgil begets a smile somewhat broader when he shows Menoetes drying himself upon the rock and still more mirth, later, when old Entellus chases Dares about the field. But Milton, mindful of his master, seems to have taken his measuring-stick after two such lapses and to have drawn the line. Is it to be said that Milton was so possessed by the Augustan that he copied his faults ? If so, in how far is the great Anglican to be discounted for plagiarism? First, it may be said that Vir- gil's faults are neither numerous nor fatal; as for plagiarism, it is a word which cannot be applied to geniuses. The highest form of creative work is selective imitation, and it is general judgment in selection which marks the artist. Upon the whole Milton, like all his great predecessors since the dawn of time, selected well.</page><page sequence="3">468 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL To take an example: on first reading, the athletic games in hell (II, 528 ff.) seem incongruous and not in keeping with the melancholy state of the outcast hosts; it would appear that Milton used the incident which Virgil details at such length in Book V merely because he thought games a necessary part of the epic structure. But Milton had a further purpose. Almost unfail- ingly he adapted the epic form to his thought, and in this case it can be seen that recreation is an altogether natural consequence after the adjournment of the Stygian council, during the delibera- tions of which no small tension must have seized the audience. But what is the more fundamental principle involved? To heighten his picture Milton is expertly employing contrast, just as the Roman makes his readers relax in Book V after the tragedy of Dido. Variety and contrast in Paradise Lost are brought about not- ably too by the relaxing expedients of the Homeric simile and the plural simile, which serve both to abate the pace and to delight. Like Virgil, Milton introduces his innumerable similes with the familiar "as when" (veluti), except in the shorter comparisons where no formal word is needed. Against a like background Milton uses sometimes the same simile, as in describing the throngs on the banks of Acheron, "thick as forest leaves that fall at autumn's first frost" Virgil provides his disciple with "thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks in Vallombrosa," and to treat different aspects, as they frequently do elsewhere, both writers here use the double simile, Virgil expanding upon birds flocking shoreward from the deep, and Milton upon the sedgy Red Sea and Pharaoh's engulfed army. But the ancient poet's longer Homerics from eight to twenty lines, in especial similes of the hunt, of the wolf and sheepfold, of the winds, fire, ships, are repeatedly adopted in the Biblical poem, of which they make such a picturesque and essential part that it is plain Milton considered those figures an element inseparable from epic form. As to the characters, Milton was confronted with the more gigantic task because he had to generalize, to portray universal human experience at its inception. Still there is a grandeur of</page><page sequence="4">IMPRINTS OF AENEID ON PARADISE LOST 469 generality about Aeneas, Anchises, Turnus, Dido, Drances, to name only a few, by which the English creator did not fail to profit. Satan has the energy of Turnus, Raphael the dramatic visualizing power which suggests that Milton must have kept to the front of his mind the Anchises of Aeneid VI. And assuredly the imperishable "dux femina facti" and "varium et mutabile semper femina" would indicate the premeditated sisterhood of Dido and Eve. Moreover, Milton deftly appropriates Virgil's trick of fitting the atmosphere to the occasion, as we observe when "Sky lour'd, and, muttering thunder, some sad drops Wept at completing of the mortal sin Original:" appears to be virtually a transcript of "Interea magno misceri murmure caelum incipit; insequitur commixta grandine nimbus" - the moment so tragic in the lives of both women. Virgil is more graphic both in brief portrayal of character and in its steady development. The minor characters in the Aeneid flash quickly and are gone, but their image remains; the leading actors reveal more of their human selves as the epic progresses, and they dominate our interest. Vagueness indeed Virgil has - can anyone be vaguer than Achates, obscurer than Lavinia ? But is the general impression of vagueness in the characters of Para- dise Lost wholly attributable to an aloofness from realism which Milton felt he must keep by very nature of his theme? If so, Milton escapes the charge very handily. We are not here attempt- ing comparisons, we are not arguing which author was the greater, but in the case of those characters of Milton upon which Virgil's imprint is fainter we cannot help wishing, even allowing that the English poet was abstract purposely, that more of the Latin's electrifying definiteness had been absorbed. Upon the one hand take the instances of God and His Son, upon the other take Ju- piter, Juno, and the lesser deities. It is easy to hold that the gods were more individual and material, whereas Our Father and His Son are universal and spiritual, but did not the Romans devoutly consider their pagan gods equally spiritual, equally universal? God and the Son of God look down upon the earthly scene exactly as Jupiter, Juno, and Venus look down. Milton adopts well the</page><page sequence="5">470 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL ancient's plan as to point of view. Then, he retreats into abstrac- tion, and except for the filial adoration and submission of the Son there is scarcely a notable characteristic either in Son or Father concrete enough to be recognized as at once both divine and human. Should They be so ethereal? Their speeches are too long, and if there be contrast it is by that very length so weakened as to lack the force needed for characterization. Since divinity is not anthropomorphic it is plain that Milton's characters are, and should be, more difficult to get than Virgil's, yet it is hardly to be denied that had Milton essayed a warmer, more intimate touch certain portions of Paradise Lost would prove more stimulating. Of the general epic construction and detail which the English poet adopts from his literary ancestor no part is more sedulously patterned than the dialogue. If Milton kept constantly in mind his subject, Virgil never forgot either his subject or his charac- ters' development. But that uneasy feeling which led Cowper at the end of his note on Paradise Lost to admit that perhaps Virgil was a contender for honors with Milton as a master of variety, that feeling would have been less indecisive had he examined at the moment the dialogue of the Aeneid. Fascinating as is Book IX in the modern poem, the dialogue is mechanical for two reasons: the quotations are uniformly long and the inter- spersed passages are uniformly short and slight, actionless. Virgil bequeathed Milton his "dixit," "dixerat," his "vix ea dicta," but not his "Iuppiter haec paucis." In Paradise Lost (not only in the typical instance of Book IX but throughout) it is everlastingly "non . . . contra pauca refert." In the exchange of views be- tween Adam and Eve you wonder at times whether the listener does not nod, and occasionally you feel that he ought to interrupt. Nor do we readily recall in Milton those fine bursts of vibrant character such as Turnus' reply to Drances, or Dido's rage at the deviating Aeneas. Too often there is a certain supinity, if not a static quality, about the characters in English, not merely about Adam and Eve, but discernible in most of the fiends and angels. Satan's words in soliloquy are fitting, and masterly, no less effective for their length. Here, however, Milton is reminiscent</page><page sequence="6">IMPRINTS OF AENEID ON PARADISE LOST 471 not of Virgil but of Shakespeare, whose villains - Iago, Richard III, Edmund, the Bastard in King John, and the rest - are memorable in similar scenes. If the artistic character triumph of Paradise Lost is Satan it cannot be said that he, at any rate, fails to develop. Fear of the devil's baleful approach is the haunting charm of Milton's epic. Did the author not grasp the value of such an overshadowing influence, so pervasive, so ever imminent, withal so conducive to epic unity, from none other source than the Juno of the Aeneid? Both Juno and Satan appear as the trouble-makers at the very beginning of the poems, both are ubiquitous, subject only to one Supreme Ruler. In methods of operation, of course, the two are quite distinct, for Juno exerts her powers through a broad variety of agents, while Satan, though he marshals all his lieutenants for the battle against God, believes that his invasion of Eden to be well done must be done by himself alone. It is true that Lucifer sends his repre- sentatives, Sin and Death, to succeed him upon the earth, but he so decides only after he has carried out his principal plan. He is awesomely isolated. Books III, IV, IX, and X, perhaps the most moving in Paradise Lost, Satan commands, as the independent protagonist, stealth personified. He appears in long soliloquys, for hundreds of lines he translates himself from one vantage point to another. Juno on the contrary is never so continuously before us - in his matchless artistry Virgil is too governed by variety for that. Mention of a possible forerunner of Satan leads to examination of his aides. Without trying to make every character in Milton accept its prototype from Virgil - for that would be not only ungenerous to Milton, but would be indeed on my part to brandish hammer and nails and saw and chisel - it may be observed briefly that Mammon echoes traits of Pygmalion, Belial is another Drances, and Moloch presents the elaborate inhumanity of Mezen- tius. The opening scenes of the English epic give the author a rare chance to portray individuals by contrast, and he so vivifies mentally the members of the congress of fiends that they take the reader strikingly in the manner of Virgil. Why do such charac-</page><page sequence="7">472 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL ters impress ? It is human nature to be more interested by culti- vated wickedness than by absolute goodness. We all have our hamartia, and the contemplation of those whom we like to pro- nounce greater sinners than ourselves is our wholesome catharsis. We achieve a certain admiration for Gabriel, Ithuriel, Raphael, Michael, but the pace of the epic cannot fail to slacken during portions of the angel scenes, just as the Aeneid declines in tempo when the gods intervene. There is less suspense when we know that the angels in nearly all instances are invincible (we are almost gratified when Satan gets into Eden despite them), and correspondingly interest often ebbs when Virgil's gods interfere with the turn of human events. For all that, the variety lent by both angels and gods is pleasing. By the similarity of the two superhuman sects Milton was definitely helped, and in no case more notably than by the descent of Raphael (Book V), when he comes to warn Adam and Eve of the future and to recount the past. Here Milton goes direct to Aeneid IV, 238-58, and in twice the number of lines he brings Raphael to earth after the manner of Mercury's descent, and ends with "Like Maia's son he stood" . . But there is this important difference between the gods and the angels: the angels are all righteous, the gods are or are not as the occasion suits. Again Virgil's variety. What is the comparative result in the two epics ? Plainly, whatever Milton loses in variety he in large measure makes up by greater force of contrast. Except Adam and Eve, every character in Paradise Lost is either thoroughly good or thoroughly bad. The fiends from Lucifer down stand sharply and constantly distinct from God and the lesser exponents of right. If the scenes with the devil and his host in hell are less vivid, less stirring than Aeneas' tour amid the shades (and certainly Milton has no character so acutely drawn as old Charon), there is at least never any doubt as to the morals and the purposes of Beelzebub and of each of the other infernal spirits. As stated above, the English poet drew traits for his sub-devils from the Latin's earthly figures. Belial - "to nobler deeds timorous and slothful; yet he pleased the ear"; Drances - "larga quidem, semper tibi copia fandi tum cum bella</page><page sequence="8">IMPRINTS OF AENEID ON PARADISE LOST 473 manus poscunt." Moloch-- "sceptred king . . . the strongest and the fiercest spirit That fought in heaven"; Mezentius - "superbo imperio et saevis tenuit armis." Mammon - "This desert soil Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold; Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise magnificence"; Pygmalion- "auri caecus amore." And there may be added the physical like- ness Milton draws of Beelzebub to Virgil's Atlas. Finally,though we can hardly detect much of Aeneas in the Miltonic work, there are certain repeated resemblances between Michael's sword and the Trojan's spear; the modern kept a steady eye on panoply, which is really bound up with character in the large. Milton's handling of tragic episodes invites scrutiny of what he drew from the ancient. Naturally we select as typical the likeness of incident in Aeneid IV to that in Paradise Lost IX. The protagonist is the woman. Eve's beauty has much in com- mon with Dido's, and the willfulness of both tends to the same climactic fatality, except that in the English epic the seduction is the climax of the whole poem while the climax of Dido's sin is merely episodic. Dido's preliminary discussions with Anna point in the same direction as Eve's pleadings with Adam to let her wander off alone, with this difference: Anna seconds Dido's desire whereas Adam is stubbornly reluctant to give into his mate. Juno here plays the part of Satan in so far as she is the motivator and inciter who makes the act inevitable. Of fitness of the setting to the deed mention has already been made, and it is now in order to add that the discomfiture of Nature in Paradise Lost is drawn both when Eve falls and when Adam gives in later. Throughout each episode the authors employ Homeric simile freely, and some of the finest descriptive bits, as the lines on morning and the woodland scenes - all in high contrast to the impending evil, are found in both. Milton's magnificent description of the serpent, however, II, 498-504, is from Aeneid V, 84-90, and in substance is practically a reprint. To look for points of contact between the snaky Satan and Aeneas is hardly flattering to the father of the Romans, yet it must be said that once the gods admonished Aeneas to set sail he lost scarcely more time than the serpent him-</page><page sequence="9">474 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL self in getting "back to the thicket." As to climaxes within the episode, if we consider Virgil to have two (Dido's fall and her suicide), Milton in this respect does not follow, but puts his highest point (Eve's fall) a little more than half way through the book. This method is simpler, and interest in the anti-climax is little lessened. Another tragic account in which the Englishman borrows largely from the Aeneid is the war between God and Lucifer. Because of the story within a story our thoughts unavoidably recur to Aeneid II, though we look in vain for such graphic character portrayal as Virgil attains in Pyrrhus, Laocoon, Sinon, Priam. The panorama of Milton's hosts of heaven in martial array is reminiscent rather of the last hundred lines in Aeneid VII. There is nothing so tremendous in Virgil as that final swallowing up of the foes of God. Virgil had to carry on his war tooth and nail, man for man, until the fight narrowed down at last to the two champions. To digress a moment, the down- ward plunge of Satan's army was destined to have a curious parallel in history: the calamitous fall of the French cavalry into the unseen ditch at Waterloo. A mass of lesser detail, which in accumulation disclosed how profoundly Milton studied the great Augustan, now presents itself. It is worth remark that both Virgil and Milton them- selves speak in the course of their epics. The modern did so perhaps only after he had discovered the propriety of self-expres- sion in such a poem. Poignant pathos resides in Milton's refer- ence to his blindness, in Book III which begins "Hail, holy light !" But Virgil employs personal observation with yet higher artistry. With terrific climactic effect his "Fortunati ambo!" caps the Nisus and Euryalus tragedy, one of the most memorable in all literature. Another imprint of Virgil, still plainer, concerns the lines on the descent to hell and the ascent therefrom: Aeneid VI, 126-8 finds repetition in the difficulties of Satan to gain the earth and the ease with which he goes down on his return, "the prim- rose way to the everlasting bonfire." Milton's doglike fidelity in following his master is eminently seen in his repeated lines on the</page><page sequence="10">IMPRINTS OF AENEID ON PARADISE LOST 475 sunrise. Neither writer ever misses a chance to salute the "rose- ate dawn"- in epic it must never rain at daybreak. And we must accord the modern a rare sense of selection in appropriating the lines in Aeneid VI on Tartarus and Phlegethon; with equal vividness Milton assigns these lines to Michael in Book XI, wherein Adam views world-misery. Yet Milton seldom gives lengthy detail in the Virgilian manner except in Book IV, and there the sensuous depicting of Eden has more the style of the Georgics. It is true, however, that both epics contain catalogues of names - Virgil his several lists of warriors, Milton his roster of evil spirits, and his veritable ark of animals, rather tediously enumerated. As to mythological allusions in a Christian epic, the fact that they are an element of beauty is reason enough to admit them. Mythology belongs to all epic, and classic allusions lend variety. Virgil has scraps of tradition which he expanded by his vigorous invention, and Milton did likewise; the latter quite as readily perceived the fitness of such invention in epic. For example, Virgil knew the legend of the wanderers eating their tables - of that he made an unforgettable pair of incidents; Milton found in Scripture the eating of the apple, and upon that shred he built his most dramatic episode. It remains to consider briefly the arrangement of the books and the endings in both poems, with devices for introductions, sus- pense, and climax. While Milton must avoid much of Virgil's realism he leans heavily on the ancient, we have tried to show, for general epic construction and for such detail as simile and allusion. The English poet determined his keel, the triumph of God, even as he saw the keel of the Aeneid to be the triumph of Aeneas. And as he pictured Adam the human race in general, so Virgil made Aeneas the race of civilization. Virgil invoked the muses Erato and Calliope, his successor called forth the heavenly muse and chiefly, the Spirit. But a more interesting reinvocation takes place at the outset of the seventh book of each epic. Milton there asks Urania to descend because the locus of the poem is changing from heaven to earth, while Virgil has "Nunc age, Erato," because his radical change of scheme from</page><page sequence="11">476 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL the wanderings to the final landing makes a renewal of the invo- cation fit. In variety of arrangement of the books and in neversagging suspense Virgil excels. It must be remembered, however, that Milton's theme does not demand the unflagging, rising, tightening suspense called for by the events of the Aeneid. Yet Paradise Lost suffers by three books of anticlimax, while the Aeneid gains in artistry by its zenithal finish. There is consummate skill in keeping Aeneas separated from Turnus until the final encounter, and there is likewise admirable craftsmanship in avoiding the meeting of Eve and the serpent for nine books. Although it descends in interest, Book X is essential because we are eager to know what befalls Satan and Adam and Eve. Likewise another hundred lines, if not another book, of the Aeneid, would satisfy the curiosity of many as to what Aeneas does consequent upon the hour of victory. But the last two books of Paradise Lost contain rather too much of the familiar narrative of the Penta- teuch to be enlivening. They lack that divine appeal Virgil attained in his lines centering upon "tu Marcellus eris," albeit Roman history was as familiar to Romans as the Old Testament to English readers. The unchronological order of the books at each beginning has been noted. Virgil gets more variety and more clearness by confining his prior events to two books, but the prolonged visit of Raphael to Adam and Eve, stupendous as most of the angel's recounting looms, carries monotony. The final point is that both epics end happily: the one, through achievement of a goal; the other, through comfort by repentance and supplication.</page></plain_text>
