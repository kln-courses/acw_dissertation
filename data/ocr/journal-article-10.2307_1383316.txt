OF BISON AND MAN: FROM THE ANNALS OF A BISON YESTERDAY TO A RE- FRESHING OUTCOME FROM HUMAN INVOLVEMENT WITH AMERICA'S MOST VALIANT OF BEASTS. Uni- versity Press of Colorado, P.O. Box 849, Niwot, Colorado 80544, xii + 231 pp. ISBN 0-87081- 450-0. Price (hard-bound), $32.50. This small book is about the American bison, its past, present, and future. The book consists of a preface, prologue, 10 chapters, a bibliog- raphy, and an index. In the early chapters, the book is illustrated with a number of archival drawings and photographs. In the later chapters, more-recent photographs are used. The purpose of the book (Chapter 1) is "to portray, what was, what now is, and what can yet be" with regard to the bison in North Amer- ica, and the author has arranged the chapters to fulfill the purpose. In Chapter 2, the author considers what a bi- son is and what a bison is not, pointing out that it should not be confused with a variety of Old World animals that are referred to as "buffalo." The author attempts to discuss some of the basic taxonomy of the bison but confuses the terms species and specific epithet and in one place re- fers to the family Hominidae as a subfamily. Al- though not in this chapter, the author used the word "specie" rather than "species" in three different places. There also are instances where the author succumbs to anthropomorphism- e.g., "predators studied herd animals carefully." Chapter 3 examines the question, how many bison were there? The material included herein is a rehash of what can be found in many pre- viously published "buffalo" books. The author makes liberal use of quotations from early trav- elers, explorers, military personnel, and settlers. Chapter 4 reviews the relationship between the Native Americans and the bison, beginning with the immigration of Native Americans onto the North American continent, which tribes in- habited the Great Plains, and how they used bi- son. Topics include methods used in hunting, comments made by early travelers about these techniques and how the bison, particularly white ones, played a central role in the rituals and cer- emonies of some tribes of Native Americans. Chapter 5 discusses the bison in relation to environmental problems posed by native preda- tors and harsh weather conditions. Wolves, griz- zly bears, coyotes, and cougars are all men- tioned and illustrated with stories of physical combat between bison and their predators. Nat- ural disasters covered include fire, deep water, blizzards, and tornadoes. Chapter 6 deals with the slaughter of the bison by white men. Killing for sport, meat, and hides and the collection of the bones are discussed. The author emphasizes the role that the railroads played in facilitating the slaughter of the bison, but fails to mention one of the primary forces behind the slaughter for hides, namely the de- velopment of factory tanning techniques that permitted large numbers of hides to be pro-</page><page sequence="2">696 JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY Vol. 80, No. 2 cessed in a brief period of time. Included in this chapter is a mention of proposed protective leg- islation as well as the urging of some military personnel to rid the land of bison in order to control the Native Americans. Chapter 7 discusses the recovery of the bison from its near extinction. The history of those first individuals who began to keep herds of bi- son is mentioned along with the establishment of the herd in Yellowstone National Park. The formation of the American Bison Society is dis- cussed. In part through the urging of this orga- nization, herds were established in the Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma and the National Bison Range in Montana. Chapters 8 and 9 bring the bison to modem times with the development of bison herds main- tained for profit by more than 2,000 persons in the private sector. The author considers bison ranching, the location of these ranches, and the associated problems with rearing bison for the market. The author discussed the first organiza- tion of the bison industry-the National Buffalo Association founded in 1967 to promote the bi- son. A second organization, the American Buf- falo Association, was founded in 1975 and the two merged in the early 1990s. The role of the public sector is discussed thoroughly with re- spect to herds in Yellowstone National Park, the Wichita Mountains, the National Bison Range in Montana, Fort Niobrara in Nebraska, and Sully's Hill National Game Preserve in North Dakota. The author discusses problems associated with public herds and how they might be overcome, and he includes in this chapter the location of publicly owned herds at the state and federal level. The final chapter is a brief summary. In the first six chapters the author makes lib- eral use of quotations from early writers-nat- uralists, explorers, pioneers, and military per- sonnel-which I have always delighted in read- ing. However, this material largely is a restate- ment of published information that can be found in any number of works on the American bison. The remaining portion of the book chronicles the recovery of the bison population from the brink of extinction and the subsequent growth of the herds on federal and state public lands and on private ranches. It is this portion of the book that perhaps is the most valuable in that the au- thor has brought together a variety of sources to detail the growth and problems faced by the fledgling bison industry. I was frustrated during the reading of this book because the author's handling of citations was not only inconsistent but in many cases lacking altogether. Frequently I was left won- dering the source of the information I was read- ing. In other instances, a citation was provided in text-author, publication date, and page num- bers, if material was quoted. Then, as expected, the complete citation was provided in the bibli- ography. Unfortunately the author did not follow this format throughout. In some cases, a com- plete citation was provided in the text and also in the bibliography. In other places, the author and a partial citation was given in text but not in the bibliography. Sometimes the author alone was cited in text with no date, and in other plac- es the author was cited in text with no title and no date, and no pages, even with quoted mate- rial. In addition, the author frequently used quo- tations from secondary sources, even though he had access to the primary source and, in some cases, included the primary source in the bibli- ography. Because of the unfortunate lack of consisten- cy in using and handling citations, the book will be of little use to the serious scholar. Rather the book will be useful to the layperson who desires to read the general story of the bison, its demise, recovery, and place in American Industry, with- out concern for the source of the information presented.-EUGENE D.
