In this article the term prehistoric encompasses everything that predates the intro- duction of writing to Cyprus, which took place during the Late Bronze Age, around 1500 B.C.E. Determining the cultural se- quence in Cyprus is often a problem because of the curious lack of tells. Why each successive culture chose to establish its settlements at some distance from those of its predeces- sors has never been satisfactorily explained, but the fact that Cyprus was an island is surely a major factor to be considered. This settlement pattern, which began in the Neo- lithic period and survived to the modern era, has the advantage of generating archaeological deposits that are covered only with topsoil and not the debris of subsequent cul- tures. It is, therefore, possible to excavate larger expanses of prehis- toric sites with less expenditure of time and resources. However, it does complicate the establishment of cul- tural sequences without indepen- The arrow indicates where a collapsed rock shelter, or cave, was found in 1980 by an amateur fossil hunter on the Akrotiri penin- sula. The picture was taken before the area, called Aetokremnos (Eagle Cliff), was exca- vated.

Proto-Neolithic Cyprus When human beings first arrived on Cyprus has been debated since the search for Palaeolithic remains began more than half a century ago (Schaeffer 1936). No firm evidence of pre-Neolithic occupation existed prior to the chance find of lime- encrusted bones associated with chipped stone implements on the Akrotiri peninsula in October 1980 (Swiny 1988). This discovery, by an amateur fossil hunter, ultimately led to an excavation that has changed our understanding of Cypriot pre- history (Simmons 1988).

Akrotiri-Aetokremnos, also known as Site E, is a collapsed rock- shelter or cave with a rich deposit of pygmy hippopotami and elephant bones, representing about 120 of the former but only three of the latter species. Many of the bones are burnt. The occupants also consumed marine shells and, on occasion, birds, fish, and eggs. They apparently wore necklaces of shells, embellished with green serpentinite beads and pendants, and used the local chert and beach pebbles for chipped and ground stone tools. The site is remarkable because it proves that human beings, not climatic change, were ultimately responsible for the disappearance of the island's endemic fauna, which we know arrived during the Pleisto- cene epoch (Swiny 1988). A coherent sequence of carbon-14 dates indicates that Aetokremnos was occupied two millennia before the floruit of the aceramic Neolithic period. It is not known whether the island remained inhabited in the interim or if the colonists departed after hunting the hippopotami and elephants to ex- tinction. It should be noted that Aetokremnos is perhaps not the only site where these animals were exploited. Several so-called Pleisto- cene faunal deposits that have also yielded artifacts, shells, and burnt bones must now be reinvestigated. Aceramic Neolithic Cyprus The aceramic Neolithic settlements, of which about a score are currently known (Held 1982), tended to be located in naturally protected posi- tions. Petra tou Limniti, located on the northwest coast, was not an island during the Neolithic period, but it was certainly a promontory. Equally isolated was Rizokarpaso- 180 Biblical Archaeologist, December 1989</page><page sequence="4">Rizokarpaso-Cape Andreas-Kastros is a good candidate for the first permanent Neolithic settlement on Cyprus. Cape Andreas-Kastros, a good can- didate for the first permanent Neo- lithic settlement on the island. It is believed that a small community, strongly dependent on marine re- sources, lived here in rather unsub- stantial circular huts (Le Brun 1981). Nevertheless, sickle blades and querns indicate that agricultural products were the mainstay of the diet, which was supplemented by small quantities of sheep, goat, pig, and fallow deer. Cypriot archae- ologists agree that all the mammals recorded at the early prehistoric sites were, intentionally or not, im- ported, since the endemic Cypriot species of hippopotami and ele- phants had become extinct. The architecture at Khirokitia- Vounoi (Dikaios 1953; Le Brun 1984) and Kalavasos-Tenta (Todd 1987), type-sites for the aceramic Neolithic, consisted of large, circular, self- contained or clustered structures, which were probably inhabited by the same family units. The dead were buried in the fetal position in small oval pits, sunk below the habi- tation floors. The few funerary offer- ings that have been discovered usual- ly consist of shell and stone bead necklaces or flattened, quern-like objects that were placed over the skull or the thorax (Le Brun 1984: figures 42, 43). Space between build- ings was hardly used except as pas- sageways. The interior of some structures was mostly occupied by substantial but enigmatic twin piers that often left little living space. One such pier had a stylized human figure with outstretched arms painted in red pigment (Todd 1981). The aceramic Neolithic culture of Cyprus, with its famed stone bowls and distinctive human and animal representations but undevel- oped chipped stone industry, does not exhibit close ties with its likely parent cultures on the mainland. The presence of Anatolian obsidian, however, proves that contacts with the outside world were maintained. Kalavasos-Tenta and Khirokitia- Vounoi were both protected at an early stage by stout perimeter walls. It has been argued that these walls existed more for psychological pur- poses than because of a real need for defense (Le Brun 1984: 20-21). Ceramic Neolithic Cyprus A gap exists between the aceramic and the ceramic Neolithic, which is represented by more than 60 sites. Ongoing research has reduced the hiatus to about 1,000 years and it may well disappear completely after further excavations or the discovery of new settlements. Sotira-Teppes, with its spectacular location atop a hill commanding a view of the south- ern coast, is the type-site for the period. It was excavated between 1947 and 1956 by Porphyrios Dikaios, the archaeologist who laid the founda- tions for Cypriot prehistoric studies (Dikaios 1961). A contemporary site at Ayios Epiktitos-Vrysi, on the northern coast of the island, was established on a small headland (Peltenburg 1982). In its earliest phase, it was cut off from the coastal plain by a defen- sive ditch and wall that protected the small, irregular, one-room, wooden structures built in hollows. This architectural tradition resulted out of a need for protection, but whether it was for protection against the elements or other humans is un- clear. The better preserved later phases consist of stone-built struc- tures containing a hearth situated in an off-central position in front of a low bench. In one example the bench had two large seats flanked on one side by two or more smaller ones, which suggests that these dwellings were constructed for a family unit. The pottery of this period, which was decorated with bold pat- terns on a white background, known as Red-on-White ware, differs from the so-called Combed ware diagnos- tic of Sotira-Teppes. Other artifacts are generally similar to those al- ready mentioned in the section on aceramic Neolithic; only the fine stone bowls are missing. No burials were discovered at Vrysi, which is not surprising since the cluster of shallow pits with inhumations de- void of funerary offerings found at Teppes was some distance from the main settlement. Important faunal, botanical, and environmental studies have suggested that Vrysi was a prosperous com- munity, well-adapted to the Mediter- ranean environment. Of note is the probable cultivation of the olive and the crushed condition of many grape seeds, suggesting that some form of wine was made. Chalcolithic Cyprus According to the limited available evidence, the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic period in Cyprus was both gradual and peaceful. In 1966, when Hector Catling wrote a chapter about Cyprus in the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods for the revised second edition of the Cambridge Ancient History, a mere four pages were devoted to the Chal- colithic. Since then, this period has been revealed as one of the island's most dynamic, original, and artis- tically productive.

J. Pelten- burg's research from 1976 onward (Peltenburg 1985). His excavations at Lemba-Lakkous and Kissonerga- Mosphilia (Peltenburg and others 1987) have revealed a thriving and innovative culture that was varied in its artistic expression. Although the inhabitants re- verted to the less flexible module of circular architecture and the sporad- ic use of intramural burials, they fully exploited the available natural materials. The flat-roofed habita- tions, up to 12 meters (about 39 feet) in diameter with raised central hearths and fine plaster floors, were sub- divided by partitions into separate activity areas. Other structures, re- served for storage, were crowded with large jars, which suggests that, for the first time in Cyprus, the economy was capable of producing a surplus. The ground stone tools - axes, adzes, and pounders -were fashioned with skill and displayed an elegance that can hardly have been uninten- tional; perhaps the appearance of copper tools with their fine angular profiles was responsible for some of these changes. It is not known whether metalworking skills were 182 Biblical Archaeologist, December 1989</page><page sequence="6">This piece, made of hard, white limestone, was found near Teppes, the first Ceramic Neolithic settlement excavated on the island. Depending on the angle from which it is viewed, the figurine may resemble a kneeling quadruped, a sitting human or an erect phallus. This last interpreta- tion links it to a stylized anthropomorphic/phallic figurine excavated at Teppes (Dikaios 1961). The figurine is 14.2 centimeters tall. Chalcolithic potters made a greater variety of wares than did their Neolithic predecessors. These figures show bold red motifs on a white background, characteristic of Chalcolithic pottery.

The Chalcolithic period is best known for its highly stylized cru- ciform figurines, usually made of serpentinite, but increasingly sup- plemented by new shapes in lime- stone and terracotta. The search for serpentinite, which was favored for personal ornaments and figurines, may have led to the collection of similarly colored nodules of green native copper or malachite at any one of the ore deposits surrounding the Troodos massif. The earliest metal objects are small and simple in shape and could easily have been forged from native copper. Smelting, melt- ing, and casting would come later. Unlike the ceramic Neolithic pottery tradition, which was re- stricted to a few shapes and wares, the Chalcolithic potters expanded their repertoire in terms of form and surface treatment. Red-on-White Since 1976, excavations by E. J. Peltenburg of the University of Edinburgh at Lemba-Lakkous and Kissonerga-Mosphilia have revealed the Chalcolithic period to be one of Cyprus's most dynamic and artistically productive eras. Even for a period of renowned artistic creativity, this enigmatic anthropomorphic vessel stands out as an achievement. Photographs courtesy of the Pierides Museum. Evidence of Fertility Site Found at Mosphilia Archaeologists recently uncovered the remains from a ritual cere- mony involving birthing and fertility in Mosphilia, a settlement on Cyprus dating to between 4000 and 2500 B.C.E. that has been under excavation for the past 10 years. "These are significant and astonish- ing finds," project director Diane Bolger said in the January 6, 1990 issue of Science News. "A ceremony in which the objects were deliberately burned, broken and taken out of circulation apparently took place." Included in the find is a group of 18 stone and pottery figurines, most of which portray women. The heads of many of these figurines have been broken off, probably deliberately, Bolger said. Some of the figurines have enlarged bellies and are sitting on birthing stones, which were used to help deliver children. One of the figu- rines even shows a child, painted red, emerging from between the legs of its mother. The figurines were found in or near a large bowl, which the research- ers believe is a model of a building previously found at Mosphilia, Bolger said. The model contained a swivel door on the side and had representa- tions of a rectangular hearth and radi- ating partitions inside. Though the function of the build- ing that the model supposedly dupli- cates is unclear, Bolger said later Cypriot cultures used circular build- ings with central hearths as birthing houses. Besides the model and figurines, the archaeologists discovered fire-cracked and ochre-stained stones, stone tools, a triton shell and stacked pottery vessels in the pit. Because of the location of the pit and the number of artifacts found in it, Bolger said the ceremony was most likely a public occasion. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland are studying the figurines more closely in an attempt to understand better the ritual ceremony. "We also need to consider why the social customs that led to ritual activi- ties at this site were put to rest after the Chalcolithic period ended" around 2000 B.C.E., Bolger said. 184 Biblical Archaeologist, December 1989</page><page sequence="8">ware, decorated with a wide array of bold, abstract motifs, is the most characteristic of all Chalcolithic pottery. A recent discovery at Mosphilia epitomizes the range of artistic ex- pression and wealth of cultural ma- terial that has been preserved from this period (Peltenburg and others 1988). A ritual deposit was found in a small, oval pit that was dug into the whitewashed floor of a building dating to the Middle Chalcolithic. This pit was packed with fire-cracked and red, ochre-stained cobbles surrounding several Red-on-White bowls and large sherds. The biggest vessel, 37 centi- meters (more than a foot) in diameter, was filled with stone and pottery figurines as well as an apparently heterogenous assemblage of artifacts consisting of: a conch shell, a stool or altar and a cone made from clay; a series of ground stone tools; a flint blade; and assorted pebbles. There were nearly 30 objects in all, and more figurines were wedged around its flat base. The bowl had a central hearth, internal divisions, and an opening for the entrance complete with a pivoting door. It was clearly meant to imitate structures actually excavated at Mosphilia. The most elaborate figurines represented women in labor, suggesting that the shrine might have been associated with reproduction and fertility. The model and many of the assorted objects appear to have been intention- ally damaged-the model was even smeared with a thin coat of buff clay. Such treatment of ritual objects sug- gests some kind of deconsecration prior to their deposition in the pit (Peltenburg and others 1988: 45). The bowl and assorted figurines invite an immediate comparison Biblical Archaeologist, December 1989 185</page><page sequence="9">Both sides of a gaming stone dating to the Middle Bronze Age that was discovered at Episkopi- Phaneromeni.

This is interpreted as a Cypriot version of the Egyptian game Senet. Bottom: the rough underside of the quern shows a spiral of hollows used in a different game called Mehen. During the Bronze Age, most of the houses in southern Cyprus had a Senet board, but Mehen boards were rare. with the so-called Sacred Enclosure from a tomb at Bellapais-Vounous dating to the late Early Cypriot peri- od (Dikaios 1940: 118 and following). It must be remembered, however, that almost a millennium and differ- ent depositional histories separate the two objects. The end of the period is marked by changes in the material culture, perhaps due to the arrival of new ideas brought by refugees fleeing the destructions recorded at many Ana- tolian sites at the end of Early Bronze II. The timing is certainly opportune if these upheavals are to be dated to around 2400 B.C.E. (Yakar 1985: 213 and following), which is slightly later than the terminal phase of the Chalcolithic in western Cyprus (Peltenburg 1985: 16, table 2). Early Bronze Age Cyprus Despite almost a century of sys- tematic excavation on the island and the pioneering work of J. R. Stewart, our view of Cypriot culture in the Early Bronze Age remains incom- plete. Prior to the work at Sotira- Kaminoudhia (Swiny 1986), knowledge of the period was primarily deduced from rich and varied funerary offer- ings (Stewart 1962). Breaks with the preceding Chal- colithic period were radical, espe- cially in such basic concepts as house form, burial customs, ceramic tradition, and the high-technology field of metallurgy. One important development, highlighted by recent archaeological surveys (Catling 1963; Swiny 1981), was a steady in- crease in the island's population. Whereas diagnostic Chalcolithic material has been located at 80 sepa- rate sites, a conservative estimation would put the number of Cypriot settlements at 270 in the Early and AV .5of Is9.

Middle Bronze ages (Swiny 1989). The introduction of metal tools, cattle and equids (asses or horses) probably had a profound effect on artisanal production as well as agri- cultural practices and was perhaps responsible for the increase in popu- lation. Many of these developments are recorded at Sotira-Kaminoudhia, the earliest Bronze Age settlement/ cemetery complex on the island to be investigated systematically (Swiny 1985). A ready supply of awls, chisels, flat axes, and knives would have enabled more sophisticated wood- and leatherworking, and the manu- facture of razors, tweezers, dress pins and copper ornaments surely had an effect on the personal appear- ance of the inhabitants. Of greatest significance for Cypriot society dur- ing this period was the arrival of cattle, first noted at Kaminoudhia. The ox-drawn plow would have in- creased agricultural production for the same expenditure of time, there- by enabling the farmer to create a food surplus and providing him with the option to engage in other activi- ties, including the pursuit of leisure. Although an equid was reported at Sotira-Teppes (Dikaios 1961: 136), the species was apparently absent during the Chalcolithic period (Croft 1986). Even if the identifica- tion at Teppes is correct, this species must have been reintroduced in the Early Bronze Age. The availability of pack animals would have revolution- ized overland transport and increased the potential for exchange between communities with access to differ- ent products. Models of equids with panniers, or baskets, and plowing scenes were deposited in Cypriot graves dating to this period (Morris 1985: figures 326, 327, 499, 500). If Kaminoudhia is representative of the island-wide Early Bronze Age, it suggests that the inhabitants lived in undefended settlements consist- ing of tightly packed, rectilinear units that were usually approached by narrow corridors. No specific plan was preferred, but two-room habita- tions large enough to accommodate a family unit were the norm. Func- tional analysis of individual units has failed to isolate specific activity areas. Rectangular hearths, low benches, and lime plaster bins were common, and they became ubiqui- tous throughout the Bronze Age. Ground stone artifacts of all types were common, and chipped stone continued to be favored to make sickle blades and other domes- tic tools, as suggested by the even scattering of flints throughout the settlement. Metalwork, on the other hand, developed rapidly in terms of availability, type and complexity. In some respects the same may be said of the ceramic assemblage. Not much is known about metal production in Cyprus during the Early Bronze Age except that the copper-base artifacts were certainly indigenous, and the industry was probably responsible for drawing Cyprus out of its previous isolation. Copper objects cast in open molds were sometimes alloyed with im- ported tin (Swiny 1986a: 32) or Cypriot arsenic. As this period pro- gressed, the variety and size of the tools and weapons increased. If the island's early metal objects can be generally viewed as func- tional- nothing resembling the quantity and variety of the Nahal Mishmar Treasure cult objects (Bar- Adon 1980) is known from Cyprus - this lack of creativity, though not ability, is certainly inapplicable to the contemporary production of ceramics. The dead were buried in ceme- teries located a short distance from the settlements wherever a suitable expanse of bedrock could be located. Most of the rock-cut funerary cham- bers were entered by way of a bath- shaped depression (dromos) and sealed by a large stone slab. They contained numerous ceramic and a few metal offerings and were care- fully arranged around the contracted body, which faced east. Reuse of the chamber (by members of the same family?) was not uncommon. Unfor- tunately, the slightly later terracotta models - such as the Bellapais- Vounous shrine - that provide such insight into some aspects of Cypriot life during this period do not repre- sent recognizable funerary customs. Only in respect to its art does this period show a regression. The static, highly stylized, plank-shaped figurines and the naive but informa- tive terracotta models do not com- pare with the powerful, lively repre- sentations of figurines dating to the Chalcolithic period. Middle Bronze Age Cyprus The Middle Bronze Age in Cyprus experienced a continuation of the preceding period with minor changes in the ceramic and metal repertoires, settlement patterns, and burial prac- tices (Astr6m 1972). A gradual in- crease in wealth, the emergence of a stratified society, and growing foreign contacts were notable developments (Swiny 1989), but these failed to cause island-wide upheavals. Forti- fied sites, restricted to the center and eastern part of the island, were an exception rather than the rule. Two major excavations, Alambra- Mouttes (Coleman and others 1983 Biblical Archaeologist, December 1989 187</page><page sequence="11">A double plank-shaped red polished figurine from the Cypriot Middle Bronze Age.

These one- period settlements and associated cemeteries without sequences of sta- tistically reliable carbon-14 dates, however, have failed to provide a satisfactorily coherent picture. For that we must wait for the results of future excavations at a range of sites that were occupied during this little- known early phase of Cypriot history.
