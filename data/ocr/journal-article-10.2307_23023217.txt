<plain_text><page sequence="1">MSJ INTERDISCIPLINARY INSTRUCTION INTERDISCIPLINARY INSTRUCTION Interview With a Wild Animal: Integrating Science and Language Arts James T. Scarnati Ask young children to write about the landscape on Mars and it often becomes a thinly disguised descrip tion of their ownbackyard (Scarnati &amp; Weller, 1989). Why, because that is what they know and experience. To read about an event is one thing, but to experience the event is immensely more meaningful. Much like a child's backyard, science class can easily be used to provide a meaningful experience for writing. In most science classrooms, inex pensive and readily available hands-on ac tivities provide an environment that facilitates the development of language arts. The fact that much writing occurs in the science classroom has not gone unnoticed. James R. Squire, retired Senior Vice-Presi dent for Ginn and Company, notes, "It may surprise some to learn that from the fifth grade onward, more writing occurs in sci ence than in any content area (perhaps in as many as 50 percent of all science classes) because recording observations and report ing on laboratory experiences are part of the basic methodology" (Hillocks, 1982, pp. 32 33). As educators we know that to write well is to think well and to think well is to be able to solve problems, and that is what science is about. The importance of integrat ing science and language arts is also recog nized by the New York State Education Department (1981): Science involves a process, an approach for acquiring knowledge and ideas; writing is one process of communicat ing that knowledge to other persons. Because science and writing can inter act with each other (if given the oppor tunity), it is advantageous to integrate these two important processes so that each will reinforce the other, (p.5) Science teachers and language arts teachers can easily work together to create a more interesting and meaningful learning environment. Jacobs (1989) says that, "... [schools] need to create learning experi ences that periodically demonstrate the rela tionship of the disciplines, thus heightening their relevancy." From a teacher's stand point, integration is more motivational be cause it allows students to develop relationships between the subject areas. The process of integration uses class time more efficiently; it encourages dialogue among colleagues; and it improves outcomes. Conducting Integrated Lessons "In addition, activity-based science is a great equalizer among children. Regardless of social, economic, academic, or ability dif ferences," all students share the same prewriting experience (Scarnati &amp; Weller, 1992). Therefore, all students have the same background upon which language arts skills can be built. The following science and lan guage arts lesson can easily be used as a model to integrate other content areas. The attention getter The life science class is about to begin. From behind the desk I slowly bring out a box, about the size of a shoebox, and raise it above my head. With student attention fo cused I ask, "What's in the box?" Not having the foggiest idea, the students sit in unaccus tomed silence. Nobody ventures a guess. Most seventh grade students believe there are only right and wrong answers and heaven forbid that they risk a wrong answer. I then ask, "Well, if you don't know what's in the box, how can you find out?" A shy grin appears on one girl's face as she says, "You can look in the box!" I accept her comment, smile and quickly respond with another question, "Are there other ways to find out what is in the box?" Again no answers. Teaching observation skills I knew I had my work cut out. The objective of the exercise is to review basic skills of observation. The establishment of an anticipatory set will prepare students for the main part of the lesson. After much coach ing the students are able to generalize that touch, sound, smell, sight, and sometimes even taste are the tools used during the observation process. The relationship between the five senses and the ability to observe is established. Middle School Journal • March 1994 3</page><page sequence="2">Several students are selected to more closely examine the unopened box and share their observations with the class. Cold, damp, smelly, musty, and heavy are some of the more common responses. Once again I ask, "Now, what do you think is in the box?" The continued silence is a signal that an impasse has been reached. The students realize that to identify the content of the box is beyond their ability to observe. I make a teaching point that, unless you are Superman and possess X-ray vision, there are limits when making observations with the unaided senses. Confident that the students are aware of the limitations, I conclude the exercise by complimenting them on the observations already made. "Later in the lesson I will show you how to become better observers," I promise the class. The process of transfer ring and applying observation skill is about to begin. Learning about the earthworm I raise the interest level by announcing, "A wild animal lives in the box and today you will have the opportunity to observe its characteristics and behavior." I open the box, gently reach in, and to everyone's surprise produce a glistening dark red earthworm. There are the usual gasps and moans as the students confront the creature. Although earthworms live all around us, many of the students have made a career of avoiding them. I introduce my earthworm as one of the more important creatures in our neigh borhood. Having cemented student atten tion, the opportunity is seized to establish a positive attitude towards living things. "Just like every other living creature the earth worm is to be treated with dignity and re spect. What do you think I mean when I say treat living creatures with dignity and re spect?" I ask. The ensuing discussion rein forces the expectation for treating animals and other living creatures in a humane man ner. After all, I quip, "Earthworms wouldn't do anything to harm us and we won't do anything to harm them." The class is informed that they will each receive their own live wild animal. After the expected groans are completed I remind them that there is no way in which they could be hurt by an earthworm. "Earthworms will not bite, scratch, or damage you in any man ner," I announce. However, I do stress that as with handling any live animal, all stu dents must wash their hands upon comple tion of the activity. Paper plates, paper towels, and con tainers of water are provided to each stu dent. I point out that unlike ourselves, the earthworm must be kept moist, but not wet. Anticipating the next question I say, "Yes, earthworms can drown" I instruct the stu dents to moisten a paper towel and place it on the plate. With box in hand, I move from desk to desk and allow each student to care fully select an earthworm. The initial noise, screeches, and anxiety soon pass. Students are neither forced to take an earthworm nor forced to handle the animal. Those few stu dents who exhibit a real fear are paired with other students in a cooperative learning situ ation. However, after a short period of time they overcome their apprehension and are soon into the swing of things. We next discuss the concept of anthro pomorphism, that is having animals assume human characteristics, and why it is discour aged in science class. Even though I discour age personalization of the earthworm many students continue to provide the animal with a name. As one child said, "I wouldn't call my dog, 'Dog'." Although not scientific, I used their compelling need to name the crea ture as an "ice breaker" and have each stu dent introduce their earthworm to the class. There are a wide variety of imaginative names, most are gender specific such as Wanda Wiggles but others are more descrip tive such as Red, Slugger, Slime Creature... The initial gender naming of the earthworm is used as a teaching point later in the activ ity. With all earthworms distributed, the students moisten their hands with water (no soap allowed) and hold the earthworm. I ask them to describe how it feels. Smooth, slimy, cold, and yuck are some of the more com mon responses. Some of the students ob serve that the top is smooth and the bottom is jagged or rough. My next guiding ques tion is, "Is the earthworm hot or cold?" Con sensus is quickly reached that it is cold. "How do they smell," I ask. The question produces some interesting comments such as it stinks like fish, like dirt, and any other smell familiar to the students. I jokingly chal lenge the students with one last question, "What sound does an earthworm make?" "You will have to be very quiet if you want to hear," I say with tongue in cheek. The class remains quiet as the students listen for earthworm-like sounds. Of course, a teacher 4 Middle School Journal • March 1994</page><page sequence="3">must remember—what goes around comes around. With a twinkle in her eye one student comments that her earthworm made a "growling noise." With these observations recorded the next phase of the investigation is introduced. "Your observation skills are very good," I tell the students. However, I call attention to the wide variety of general ized responses to my questions. Using the unaided senses of sight, touch, and smell provides a qualitative description but does not accurately describe the animal. "Is there a way to make more accurate observations?" I ask. There is no response. I rephrase the question, "How can I help you become bet ter observers?" I increase the wait-time and the students become fidgety as they search for an answer. The tension is broken by asking, "What scientific instruments can you use to increase your ability to accurately observe the creature?" "Oh yea!" yells a student, "something like a magnifying glass" With such a magnificent lead-in I immedi ately hand out two scientific instruments, a ruler and a hand lens. Measuring the earth worm is a challenge since the variability in length depends on its activity. Although a tedious task, some students use the hand lens to count the segments. While using the hand lens, other students discover tiny hair like structures on the bottom side and a blue black streak on the top side. More precise observations make it easier to accurately describe the physical characteristics of their earthworms. As I observe the class I notice the gentle nature of the earthworm brings out the gentle nature of the students. This is in sharp contrast to the classroom in which the stu dent is provided a smelly, preserved earth worm for dissection. In many schools students rarely have the opportunity to in teract with living organisms. The observa tion of a living creature is markedly different from that of a preserved specimen. Only in a living specimen can the true beauty and behavior of an animal be appreciated. As the period draws to a close, I feel confident the students have become better I—.—_ observers. Most similar activities would end at this point. However, it is important that I set the stage for the next day's lesson. "Here is your homework assignment/' I announce. Each student is given a one page earthworm reading assignment, an outline reviewing how to conduct an interview, and an assign ment to construct ten questions they would ask an earthworm during an interview. The reading assignment is important because it focuses on the role of the earthworm in its natural environment. To view the earthworm only as a physical creature would be to ig nore the interdependence of living organ isms. Reading about the relationship to its natural habitat provides students with a com prehensive overview of the earthworm's life activities. I assist students in getting started with their interview questions by modeling sample questions such as, Where do you live? "Make sure you read the assignments and write your questions. Tomorrow we will continue the study of our earthworms," I yell. Suddenly, the bell rings and the stu dents scurry into the halls. The interview process The following day students enter the room in eager anticipation. Placed on each desk is a paper grocery bag, crayons, scis sors, newspaper, and another copy of the homework reading assignment. "How many of you read the assignment?" I asked the class. As expected all hands went up, but the eyes and body language of a few students betray them. I feel it is important that all students again review the background read ing about the earthworm and its natural habitat, so I direct the class to take a few minutes to "refresh" their memory. Now certain that they had read the article I con tinue the activity. I asked a rhetorical ques tion, "Have you ever pretended to be somebody or something to better under stand the way they live?" I tell the class this is what they are going to do today. To gain a better understanding of the way it lives, each student is going to play the role of an earth worm. In addition each student is also going to play the role of a newspaper reporter. Before the students have a chance to react I divide the class into two groups: an earth worm group and a newspaper reporter group. With all eyes forward, attention is first focused on the group assigned to play the role of an earthworm. To avoid distraction I tell the reporters group to pay close attention because we will shortly switch parts. "Hav ing observed and read about the remarkable wild animal, you now have the knowledge to play the role of an earthworm," I tell the students. Once again I emphasize the rel evant word "anthropomorphism" and that Middle School Journal • March 1994 5</page><page sequence="4">earthworms cannot exhibit human behav ior. "However, I tell the students, for the purpose of this simulation we will play the role of an earthworm in an attempt to gain a better understanding of its behavior pat terns." "Oh, one more thing," I announce, "We've got to get you looking like an earth worm." Before class I applied my limited artistic skills in designing a paper bag mask of a stylized earthworm. Holding the paper bag above my head I take the opportunity to caution students not to use plastic bags as a substitute. As I slip the paper mask over my head I add, "This is what I think the typical everyday student earthworm looks like." After the laughter and snickers subside the students use their crayons, scissors, and imagination to construct a mask that best depicts their concept of an earthworm. I redirect my attention to the newspaper re porters, "What do you think a newspaper reporter looks like?" One boy must have been a comic book fan because he yelled out, "Jimmy Olson or Clark Kent." "Well, our stylized reporter will be someone who wears a hat and carries a press card," I add. I model a paper hat and using guided practice soon have the students making triangular hats out of newspaper. Each student prints "PRESS CARD" on their new headpiece and tries the hat on for size. I tell the reporters that: As a reporter your assignment is to conduct an interview with an earth worm. This type of interview is known as a 'personality' interview. Personal ity interviews record a conversation with a celebrity such as a movie star, a famous person or in our case the stu dent earthworm. Through your read ing and working with the earthworm you already have gained a great deal of knowledge about your subject. How ever, only the individual student earth worm can provide the detailed information you need to write your story (Newsom &amp; Wollert, 1988). At this point I refresh their memory about the four basic purposes for writing: to narrate or tell a story; to describe persons, places, or things with vivid word images; to explain a concept, process, or event; and to persuade others to accept a different point of view. I remind them that newspaper writ ing, as in all good writing, should include who, what, when, where, and how. I stress that the most important of these five ele ments should be in the first or lead sentence and the headline should reflect the overall theme of the article. Elements of effective writing such as interest and sense of audi ence are also reviewed. The students are instructed to take good notes, report the facts, and use their skills to develop a feature story. By the time I finish preparing the re porter group the earthworm group has com pleted their task and is becoming a bit frisky. It is now time to pair reporters with earth worms. Soon the interview process begins. Moving from group to group I hear some very unearthworm-like answers to the reporter's questions. Yes, these students are very clever and worldly earthworms. Hav ing the paper mask over the face of the stu dent earthworm does assist in creating an on-task environment. As the reporters ap proach the end of their interview the roles are switched and we begin the process over again. By the end of the period, each student has the opportunity to be both a reporter and an earthworm. I announce to the class, "Your home work assignment is to write a feature news paper article. Don't forget the headline and the techniques we reviewed for writing a story. Good luck and I'll see you tomorrow." The next day the students hand in their articles. I am consistently amazed at the mix ture of creativeness and knowledge that can be combined by youngsters to make enjoy able reading. Adults may not realize it but I can assure you children do read the tabloid headlines at the grocery store check out counters. Headlines such as, "Freddie the Worm Isn't Really a Freddie," let me know that they discovered earthworms are neither male nor female. Naming an earthworm will never again be an easy task for these students. As I read through the articles I chuckle, frown, and sometimes even gasp at what is reported. Those articles that are out standing works of "Wormology" are sub mitted to the school newspaper for consideration. The earthworm activity is a model for interdisciplinary lessons that can be used at the upper elementary and the middle school level. Also incorporated in the lesson is the linguistic, the spatial, thebodily-kinesthetic, and the interpersonal modes of learning as defined by Howard Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences. Altering the activ ity to be a simulated interview with a tree, a number, a person from a different society, or any familiar topic provides the design flex ibility for use in a variety of subject areas. The activity involves students in the applica tion of their knowledge, their experiences, their values, and their creativity. Remember, kids write best about what they know and experience. Concrete class room activities provide a common base for success in the language arts. In such an ac tive learning environment students are pro vided the first hand prewriting experiences that prepare them for writing about them selves and their natural world. References Gardner, H.
