<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 20 Homecoming "No Epilogue, I pray you, for your play needs no excuse/' — Shakespeare "A Midsummer-Night's Dream" "Still Crazy After All These Years." — Paul Simon Thursday, May 14,1992 — The passing of almost 20 years have been kind to "Old Tom," as the cabin has come to be known. Would that I had come through that period as unscathed. I am sitting on the silver-gray deck as a perfect spring dusk creeps down Sourwood Holler. Below, a swollen Silver Creek is chortling from two days of rain. Above, an almost full moon peeps over the silhouetted piney east ridge. The sweet smell of May is tinged with the acrid smell of wood ashes — ashes not from a wood stove but from a house fire. Homecoming indeed. The very term implies that you have a home to come back to. Only the heroics of friends and the Green Hill Volunteer Fire Department makes this simple moment of serene creekside contem- plation possible. It's hard enough for me to grasp that this cabin is pushing 20, and that the bright golden cedar roof Charlie Ratcliffe, Bill Byers, and I lay down in 1974 should have turned to so much tinder just waiting for a dry spell, an errant spark, and a malicious wind to burst into a confla- gration. In short, my roof had turned into a disaster waiting to happen. On Friday night, Jan. 31 of this year, all those factors combined. And it wasn't until he heard the roar of the flames that my house-sitting friend, Tony Napoli, realized what was happening. Phoneless, he sent a visiting friend sprinting up the hill to get Bill, who a couple of years ago moved into Gene Ham's log cabin. Bill called 911 and then set out for the cabin to help. </page> <page sequence="2"> Homecoming 211 Meanwhile, Tony was so adrenalated that he practically vaulted onto the porch roof and then up onto the main roof where the fire was raging through the dry shingles beside the kitchen chimney. He'd dragged the garden hose up there with him, but when he turned it on, nothing came out. The old thing had crimped and tangled below, cutting off the water. But Tony wasn't about to let that stop him, and so he ripped off his sweater and began beating on the flames. Tony said later that as he was fighting the fire he had a "little chat" with the Almighty, not making any promises about lifestyle changes, but acknowledging that some divine providence would be mightily ap- preciated right about now. And right about then, he heard the sirens. By a stroke of good fortune (how about more divine providence) the Green Hill boys only knew where the cabin was because of a grass fire the week before down at the nearby Big House. About this time, Bill arrived at the top of the road and saw the flames in the Holler. "Good-ness, Jock," he exclaimed later, "I wasn't worried about your cabin — I figured that was a goner — I was worried about the woods." Bill said the fire was so hot that zephyrs shot off the burning shingles like a prairie fire in a stiff wind. So hot the Styrofoam insulation crumpled like squashed ants. So hot the aluminum roof flashing melted in misshapen silver blobs, and the asphalt roofing paper flowed and dripped like melted wax. The firemen arrived, pausing briefly at the top of the road to wonder if they could get their big trucks down my little driveway. And then throwing caution to the winds, they barreled down into the Holler, threw out their hoses, leapt on the roof, and doused the flames. The roof had burned through at the hottest point, flaming embers falling on Tony's bed below in the loft. Seeing this, the firemen rushed in the house, busting one of the loft windows so they could hurl the smoldering mattress out on the deck below where they could hose it down without fear of water damage to the house. In fact, they put out the fire with so little water damage that to this day I remain astonished. Oh sure, there is soot unending and little things to be put right, but it's piddling by comparison to what could have happened. This fire was a close thing — a dodged bullet, a narrow escape, disaster averted. The other day when I went up to the station to thank the firefighters, an assistant chief who had been on my roof told me frankly, "Another five minutes and you coulda' wrote that place off." </page> <page sequence="3"> 212 Hogivild Another five minutes and almost 20 years of loving that place — not to mention the four years of building and dreaming — would have been nothing but ashes, rubble, and memories. To say I was lucky is shallow — more like gifted, blessed, reprieved. In February, Tony cleaned up and patched the roof and found himself a new place to live so I could move back for a summer of writing and reclamation. And in March, my Brevard tennis partner and roofing contractor, Dennis Newman, who I call "Dr. Roof," gave the old cabin a brand-new fireproof fiberglass-asphalt shingle roof, the same pale golden color of the original cedar shakes. So here I sit tonight in the gathering spring evening as the smells of sweet May assail me — beauty bush and flowering wild cherry — good woodsy loamy earth smells. The silver dollar in the sky reminds me how close I came to having to draw comfort from the old Buddhist expres- sion: My barn having burned to the ground I can now see the moon. Friday, May 15,1992 — I arrived at Hogwild yesterday from Penn State where I have just completed my first year as an assistant professor of journalism with the dream job of building the School of Communica- tions' photojournalism program. From Hogwild to Penn State, from six families on 300 acres of woods to a Big 10 campus with 39,000 students: as Maggie and I used to say, "'It's a long way to Tipperary/" When I drove down the old driveway, I felt a jumble of conflicting emotions: scared of seeing the fire damage, confronting the reality and pain that I had left all this... and yet I couldn't deny my delight at being able to live here again — even if it's only a summer writing retreat. OK, I said to myself, turning the Jeep Cherokee onto the well-graded and deeply graveled "Hogwild Blvd.," I know this sentimental journey is going to be bittersweet, a minefield strewn with historical relics sure to blow up in my face. I steeled myself for the inevitable ambush. Duly, the journalist noted the changes: Bill and Jeanette's bodacious mailbox of the '70s ("Jeanette and Wm. J. Byers are Hogwild") had been replaced years ago by a cute model put up by the Floridians who had bought the place. But that mailbox, made to look like either a tiny chalet or a monstrous birdhouse, was now rotting, falling apart, and a wren was nesting in its ruins. Yet that was nothing compared to my mailbox, which was all but on its knees, the old support log totally gone to rot. Together, the two </page> <page sequence="4"> Homecoming 213 mailboxes looked downright decrepit. Continuing down the road: no trace of where the Giving House stood, and a field of daisies occupied the original log barn site of 18 years ago this summer. Pausing at both places, again I felt the kinetic energy of the ground over which I'd worked and dreamed. Just down from there, with a mixture of humor and sadness, I saw the wrought iron and brick gate the Floridians had built. Two imposing brick columns were topped by ornate lamps. I wondered, what is this — a country club? The entrance to The Addams Family estate? Talk about an anachronism. Turning toward my humble driveway, I grew philo- sophical. I knew I was going to get ambushed, and here it was. But I was unprepared for the next one. My narrow driveway, taking off to the left just above the ostentatious gate, had become overgrown with little pines. Maggie with her beloved hedge trimmers would have had a field day here, I chuckled to myself at the thought of her happily "zapping" the loathsome underbrush. And then there was Tom. If anything, he looked more at home in the Holler than I could have imagined. The growth of trees we had planted or worked to save now nurtured the cabin in return. The knee-high Colorado blue spruce planted the Christmas of '78 stood 16 feet tall, obscuring a quarter of the house from view. I stood on the lip of the hill, looking at the scene, trying to take it all in. This is not a dream, not a memory, not a photograph. I am here and Jon cooking in Tom's kitchen, summer 1992. </page> <page sequence="5"> 214 Hogwild Selena writing in the living room, summer 1992. this is now, As proof, I reminded myself, there's the new roof looking good. Then my heart leapt. There stood Ruby. In the deep shade of the chimney loomed a red shaggy apparition. I stood perfectly still and consciously made myself start breathing again. Think, I commanded. It must be a neighbor's dog which by sheer coincidence is an over-sized </page> <page sequence="6"> Homecoming 215 golden retriever. Walk, I told my wooden legs. Beat, I told my stumbling heart. Suddenly, the spirit-dog bounded happily out to me — just the way Ruby would have. I fell to my knees, threw both arms around this totally strange dog in complete trust, burying my wet face in its mane — and we rolled around the ground like children tussling. Thus did Ruby-re- incarnate welcome the prodigal back to Hog wild. When I had recovered sufficiently, I noted how through the last 12 years the renters had taken good care of Old Tom. Clearly they, too, had loved it and respected the workmanship. After being away for so long and having lived in so many modern houses, my first impression of the cabin was one of authenticity, of texture and rich colors, earth-tones of rough gray logs and lighter gray chink, of native stone and silvered barn siding, of white stucco walls and deep russet gold of the old pine floors, doors, and cabinets. How could I have left this place? It's a treasure, a family legacy beyond reckoning. Walking around in Tom, I realized the lightness of living here again — and especially of passing this magic kingdom on to the children. Indeed, not surprisingly, Selena, the little Fairy Princess of Slickey Mountain, had turned into a poet. After finishing college and working in Greensboro for a year as a para-legal, she announced her plans recently to move back to Hogwild this summer to work on her writing. What could be more perfect in the fullness of time? And "little" Jon, little no more, but now a strapping 6'2" rock 'n' roll drummer boy of 15, thinks this place is "cool" and "awesome" and wants to sound- proof one of the rooms for practice sessions. I have to chuckle at how he is turning out. Born to drum, fetal "Lizajon" must have been going for the bass drum pedal all those times he kicked Maggie. Sitting on the far corner of the deck (the prow, I used to call it, for the angle juts into the woods like a ship bravely plowing through the green breakers), I was again immersed in the aura of the place: quiet yet zooming with energy and peace for me. This is one of my main creative "hot spots," a mystical power base that recharges and regenerates me. If this is so, then what has kept me away for so long? Why has it taken the Bedouin journalist this long to take this sentimental journey home? After years of emotional questing, I think I have the answer now. Because when we are hurt and pull away, we tend to pull too hard. At least I did. It reminds me of sophomore high school biology when we studied the reproduction of spirogyra. The way the algae made more of itself was by a process called "conjugation," during which the single cell </page> <page sequence="7"> 216 Hogwild would stretch and elongate as if its two disparate poles were fighting to get out of the same grocery bag. The cell looked like it was caught in a taffy-pull until the two parts lurched violently apart in a microcosmic separation. Similarly, when our marriage ended, I had pulled myself away from Hogwild and the mountains. Pulled too hard, perhaps. But such were the needs of healing. "Rooo-by," I crooned softly to the not-Ruby dog snoozing in the sunlight at my feet. "Hey, big fella, how 'bout a walk?" I stirred out of my lethargy as the dog jumped to his feet at the magic word, "walk." First, I inspected the homestead, cataloging the deferred mainte- nance. Selena's Playhouse was still standing, though the vines had taken over. The Woodshed needed a new roof in the front. And the Smoke- house, bless its heart, was still leaning at its gravity-defying angle. As I was checking out the Smokehouse's crumbling block foundation, I spied something green and glinting buried there in the leaves. A glassy shine. It could only be one thing. And so it was — a pony-sized Rolling Rock bottle. I could date it exactly to January 1976. What a joke on me. I'd stuffed the foundation with my empties, thinking how archeologists from 2420 would find my "time capsule" from the '70s — and now look who turns out to be the explorer in his own past! Setting off on my pilgrimage around Hogwild, I paused at the top of the road where I had a clear view of Old Tom below in the Holler; it was right here that the cabin had received its anthropomorphic handle. During a 1982 visit when I had Jon, 6 at the time, we were driving out of the place — and at this exact spot, the little boy had asked pointedly, "Dad, who named Ruby?" "Maggie," I replied. "Who named Lucy?" he asked of our current dog. "Selena did," I responded. "Who named Sourwood Holler?" he wanted know. "I reckon I did," I said, wondering where all this was leading. "Yeh! And you named Obie and the Blue Shed, and Selena got to name Slickey Mountain!" Jon blurted as if this was something to which he'd given considerable thought. " — And I haven't got to name nothin' nothin'!" He sounded defi- nitely left out of the process. "Well," I said, taken aback by the injustice of it all, "what would you like to name?" "What's the cabin's name? You got a name for the cabin?" I was conscious of the boy looking at me carefully, his blue flashlight eyes boring in. </page> <page sequence="8"> Homecoming 217 "No. Reckon it's just always been The Cabin." I was really intrigued now. "What do you want to call it?" 'TOM," Jon announced seriously with scarcely a pause. "The cabin's name is Tom." Did I laugh? I don't remember. I only know I was instantly de- lighted at the notion of 'Tom" — perhaps with the affectionate prefix "Old" added for cadence and respect. Old Tom the mountain man who brought us the rocks from high off the Blue Ridge years ago. Old Tom Bombadil from the Hobbifs tale. Tom Tom the Piper's son/Stole a pig and away he run. An agelessly wise and roguish boy of an old man. Something of an irascible curmudgeon in wood. A cabin named Tom. It was perfect. How could the little boy know how well he had chosen? So, on up the drive I went, wondering at all the changes that had happened to me, to Maggie, to Bill and Jeanette, and to the folks of Hogwild. Who all was still here? W7hat did their houses look like? How many kids did they have? What had happened to the Hogwild dream? I had only inklings of some of the answers. Whereas in the mid-'70s our group was bonded by common goals, by the end of that decade, some of us were swept away from Hogwild by other equally compelling currents. The Hogwild dream became not so all-consuming, and some of our lives seemed at the mercy of forces we couldn't readily understand. Three families left and broke up, and three families stayed together and on the land. The three that left, ironically, were the original three Hogwild fami- lies: Byers, Walther and Lauterer. The three families who stayed on the land and stayed together were the three younger Byers brothers who had joined us later. Of the original three, the Walthers had the least to do with Hogwild. They did some reforestation, but that was all. Later, they divorced, and Rosemary married the town mayor and moved away. Jim moved south and went into newspaper management. In 1982 Bill and Jeanette sold their amazing house to the Floridian couple, who quickly added a front yard swimming pool — the very height of gauche, it seemed to us Hogwilders at the time. Standing at the top of my road, gazing through the gate down at the Byers' former Big House, I recalled how Bill and Jeanette had always been driven by great dreams. When they left Hogwild, it was for a new dream: to head west, buy land or an old house and start a ski lodge. However, the trip west proved that land was either inaccessible or ex- orbitantly priced. Returning to the South, they bought and renovated an </page> <page sequence="9"> 218 Hogwild old house in the ski village of Banner Elk and converted it into a bed and breakfast ski lodge. Meanwhile, Bill worked on his MBA at Appalachian State University. Although by 1983 Maggie and I had already gone our separate ways, we were stunned when we heard of their split. Why is it that your best friends' breakup is more shocking than your own? Jeanette stayed to run the inn, and Bill moved to Charlotte to sell commercial real estate — philosophically about as far a cry from Hogwild as one could possibly get, we thought. Well, I mused, turning to hike up the main road toward the old log barn and Giving House sites, it was no more revolutionary than what happened to the Lauterers. We grew in different directions. First, I began veering away when our weekly newspaper, This Week, went daily in late '78. It wasn't long until I was captivated by the siren song of starting another weekly. We left Hogwild in March 1980, having lived here less than two years — after working on it for over four years. The new weekly in neighboring McDowell County was only a marginal success, and after two very difficult years, the recession of 1982 delivered a coup de grace, and we sold out and broke up. As irony would have it, I returned to the cabin alone and lived there for a year of healing, before going to teach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brevard College, and then Penn State. During this time, 1982-92, in order to make ends meet, we rented the cabin to a series of house-sitting friends. Maggie was recruited by the Asheville Citizen-Times where she became a respected feature writer, photographer and columnist with the touch of an Appalachian Will Rogers. She subsequently joined WLOS- TV in Asheville, continuing her unique personal style of journalism, winning many awards for her work. A couple of years ago, she married a wonderful man, Zack Allen, a former reporter turned director of the Western North Carolina Nature Center, and together they bought and restored a delightful old Waltons style place in East Asheville. For their wedding present, I gave them six weekends of bust-a-gut labor at the old farmhouse. Throughout all this, we agreed the children were our primary con- cern — that they feel loved through the separation — and so we kept that family feeling in spite of our distance and personal needs. We stayed close. We nurtured them through the split the best we could and through it all remained good friends. So as I stopped by the field where we'd found the vine-covered log </page> <page sequence="10"> Homecoming 219 barn back in the winter of '74,1 realized books and houses have a way of never ending where you think they will. Maybe things don't exactly end at all. They go right on living in spite of our best attempts to put down periods. Is that what Tom was trying to tell me all along? That hu- manity tends to see time as a horizontal line with significant dates and events marked off with short perpendicular strokes: birth, school, marriage, children, career, retirement, death — all neatly projected, plotted on your own chronological ruler. If Old Tom taught me any- thing, it's that change and growth always and forever are spiraling upward and outward. Maybe from now on I'll see life not like a yardstick, but rather a chambered nautilus. As if to underscore that thought, the big red dog and I found ourselves at the lip of the road leading down to Gene Ham's log cabin, "Kyoto Knob," inhabited now by none other than the former King of Hogwild, the architect of my dream, Bill Byers, a.k.a. Will Hogwild, himself. Now there's a neat, tight circle. My buddy on the land had returned at last to his music, his original great love. A fine singer-song- writer and guitarist, Bill had done several tapes in Nashville recently, and I think they're quite good. Moreover, he's doing exactly what he wants to do. Plus, I hear he's bought a piece of Hogwild adjoining me atop Laurel Mountain. Calls it "Toehold." What could be finer than for Will Hogwild to be a'building again? Of the Byers' children, I learned that son Ben, 17, lives there with Bill; Hannah, Selena's faithful childhood playmate, is a rising senior at UNC-Asheville majoring in history and psychology. The youngest, Will, a rising eighth grader, is with Jeanette, who remarried and moved to the famous resort community of Southern Pines and then to Beaufort, S.C. Busy as ever, she is studying computer graphics and selling real estate. And what of the other Hogwilders? I hear Gene Ham is a public school teacher in south-central Tennessee where he and his brother bought one of his old family homeplaces. Maybe he'll come visit us this summer. Every time I think of Gene, I am reminded of our fraternal society, the Knights of the Okra, whose motto is "Semper Gumbo." Bill McCullough, the superb artist who lived across the river and who could also have made his living as a rockmason, moved back to the Low Country after inheriting the family farm near Georgetown, S.C. I learned he's become a successful portrait and landscape painter. Living in Charleston, he also teaches art at the Gibbes Museum. Charlie Ratcliffe, my right-hand man, who I'd seen a couple of times in Chapel Hill while he was visiting friends, was a successful and happy interior decorator specializing in designer wallpapering. Now I hear </page> <page sequence="11"> 220 Hogwild During a summer 1992 reunion, clockwise from front, Will, Ben, Gene Ham, Bill and Hannah Byers at Gene's cabin. he's based in nearby Waynesville as a builder. He's remarried and has a young family. Mike Thompson, my mentor as both carpenter and teacher, wisely returned to his first love — teaching. After working for years as coordi- </page> <page sequence="12"> Homecoming 221 nator of the gifted and talented students program at McDowell High School, he had two books on the subject published. In 1990 he moved to Jackson, Tenn., where he married a third time, and now works with the academically gifted at the University School of Jackson, still inspiring young minds to greatness, I'll warrant. Tom Cowan, the wonderful watercolor artist who, for a time lived humbly in Bill and Jeanette's horse barn and later in a school bus parked out here, has seen his fortunes change for the better, too. An inheritance has allowed him to paint, travel, and teach as he pleases. Most recently he is setting up his own studio in Gatlinburg, Tenn. Art Boericke and Barry Shapiro, who researched and photographed Tom after we'd finished, published their work in a handsome book, Handmade Houses: the Natural Way to Build Houses, 1981, Delacorte Press. The multi-talented carpenter Joe Ryan, who helped me in so many ways in the final completion of Tom, still lives near here up on Clark Road, where he has a busy workshop. And Keith Harrill? I'd learned that 'Too-Tall" (who helped me build the Smokehouse that crazy night in '76) had become a builder in the county. Well, that fits. By the time I'd mulled over all that, I'd arrived at Bruce and Toni's place — but I hardly recognized the "cabin," for it was a cabin in its core only. Its size having quadrupled, the place was more like a homestead, Bruce and Toni Byers with sons, left to right, Zachary, Elliott, Alexander and Samuel. </page> <page sequence="13"> 222 Hogurild Stuart and Cindy Byers and children, clockwise from front, Judson, Caleb, Etta and Rachel. an estate where slick had overtaken rustic, with a classy white concrete driveway looping attractively up the hill and into a spacious turn- around play area bordered by a log garage housing a Volvo station wagon, a playhouse, basketball court and late-model VW touring bus. Off to the side they'd built a swimming pool and, farther up the hill, a lighted regulation tennis court. The reason for all this became quickly apparent. Bruce and Toni had four boys: Zachary, 11; Elliott, 9; Samuel, 5; and Alexander, 3 in August. At present they were all out shrieking with laughter as they bounced on the trampoline below the house. Inside, the house had grown hand- somely with stucco walls, exposed beams, stout casement windows and the designer colors and wallpapers that Jeanette and Maggie pioneered. Bruce and Toni dressed as if they shopped from Lands' End or L.L. Bean, and they wore it well, striking me as content and stable. Toni remembered how in 1977 when she was still in college and helping Bruce build the cabin on weekends, they had a falling-out. Toni said, "I remember thinking, 'Shoot! he's going to live here — and after all the work I've done,'" She said, grinning across the room lovingly at Bruce. </page> <page sequence="14"> Homecoming 223 Burwell and Jeannie Byers and sons, left to right, John, Thomas and Henry. As the dog and I left and loped up the hill toward the next brother's place, I encountered a new log cabin on top of the ridge facing west. The brothers' parents, Jim and Louise Byers, had had a charming weekend get-away log cabin built on old "Father Austin's View." At the homes of Stuart and Burwell, the growth had been equally exponential. By contrast, in the mid-'70s those two free-spirited guys had started by camping out at Hogwild in a teepee. Now look at their places. The original cabins of 15 years ago served now as cores for places that cried out for photo spreads in BH&amp;G or Southern Living. Yet the am- bitious additions melded harmoniously with the original structures. Stuart and Cindy had four children: Judson, 12; Etta, 10; Rachel, 7; and Caleb, 4. Their multi-leveled house seemed to go on forever. Outside, the house was complemented by at least four log outbuildings, each one a masterpiece, grouped around a paved drive with a pool tucked discreetly behind one barn. As the day lengthened into dusk I clumped down the trail to Burwell and Jeannie's. There I found that they had three boys: John, 10; Thomas, 7; and Henry, 5. Burwell had turned his place into something of a log mansion; there's just no other word for it. Huge expanses of thermopaned glass mounted in soaring gothic gables, cathedral ceilings, barnboard, rockwork and exposed beams — not to mention several more log barns. It occurred to me that the brothers had collected log barns the way some people do fine art. Hogwild had become a living </page> <page sequence="15"> 224 Hogwild museum of Southern Appalachian log structures. And the three remain- ing families had taken the design feel of early Hogwild and enlarged grandly on the theme. Unless I miss my guess, I counted no less than 15 log cabins and barns during my circuit of Hogwild. They all still worked for the family propane gas company and had made a good thing of it. Burwell and Stuart had bought the eastern bottomlands and far hill when logging had gotten too near, thus ex- panding Hogwild by another 100 acres. As I left the last brother's home, (minus the dog, who'd turned off in the woods somewhere) and traipsed down to the river road, I knew I was under the spell of a new but enduring Hogwild. The magical homecoming day was stretching into a sweet spring evening, and Stuart's easy, broad grin kept looming in front of me like a Cheshire cat. "Yeah," he had said with satisfaction, arms crossed over his chest, "we're getting dug-in." I hit my land down where the river road runs just above the rushing Rocky Broad, and there I was greeted by a musky bouquet of river scent percolating the spring dusk. As strongly as that fecund aroma, the thought came over me: Hogwild lives! There was a continuity after all. The '70s dream had changed, just as the cabins had grown in size and style, but the commitment to the land and to each other was very much intact in the '90s. The three brothers and their wives had taken the baton passed by Hogwild's founders and had carried very well in our absence. Now Bill Byers is back and building. I'm living in Tom, who survived his trial by fire. And Selena is coming to live here. Even the Floridians, who, after a decade, have become "Hogwild-ized," are a part of this place, too. They don't seem so different from us now as they once did. Have they become more like us, or have we become more like them? I couldn't help wondering at the contrast between the '70s and now. Had we all turned into the YURPies I'd joked about back then — Young, Upwardly-mobile Rural Professionals — with central heat, pools, mini- vans, Jeep Cherokees, VCRs, camcorders, and retrievers? Even the irony of my spending the summer writing on a state-of-the-art Apple Macin- tosh in a log cabin was not lost on me. As I hiked on along the overgrown trail back toward Old Tom, I realized how much of a community this place has become. Just look at the number of kids here now. Why, Hogwild could easily field its own Little League team. At the brow of Sourwood Holler I was greeted by the sound of a homecoming committee in full voice. Down in the Soccer Field a whole vibrant flotilla of bog frogs, spring peepers, were chorusing their wheezy welcome. </page> <page sequence="16"> Homecoming 225 Then, as if on cue from some master stage-lighting technician, over Slickey Mountain there billowed a May full moon, casting its golden luminescence upon the cabin standing sturdily in the Holler below. I stood transfixed, as if hearing my name called faintly but unmistakably. It was Sourwood Holler calling me home. I was caressed by the knowl- edge, as sure as the moonlight, that Hogwild would always beckon, and that I would always answer, "Yes!" The ultimate affirmation of what I had dreamed of, worked on, lived for, lived through — as well as left behind, returned to, reclaimed, and reconciled, could be reduced to three simple letters: Yes! Another moonrise over Sourwood Holler as Hogwild beckons me home. </page> <page sequence="17"> This page intentionally left blank  </page> </plain_text>
