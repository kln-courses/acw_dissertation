<plain_text><page sequence="1">T'oung Pao LXIX, 4-5 (1983) VERSES FROM ON HIGH: THE ASCENT OF T'AI SHAN BY PAUL W. KROLL "Les montagnes sont, en Chine, des divinites." Thus Edouard Chavannes (1865-1918) began his magnificent monograph on T'ai Shan *[Lf, reminding us that the most prominent features of the Chinese landscape are not merely natural, but numinous, objects.1 One of the great virtues of Chavannes' classic study-and one apparent also in the more recent monographs on the important peaks Lo-fou Shan ,3-F14 and Mao Shan *W by Michel Soymie and Edward H. Schafer, respectively2-is the detailed documenta- tion and evocation of the manifestly sacred climate that traditionally invested China's "notable mountains" (ming shan t I). Indeed it was not only the most eminent alps but lesser mounts as well that commonly called forth, in the men of ancient and medieval times, varying kinds and degrees of religious feelings. It is no accident, for instance, that virtually all of Meng Hao-jan's j:A, (689-740) poems set in alpine environs (excepting only those works celebrating the familiar hills of Hsiang-yang, his native place) are imbued with explicit Buddhist or Taoist imagery.3 Likewise, the mountain verses of most medieval writers are rarely the simple portrayals of land- scape-mere "nature poems" (to use a critically useless term)- that many scholars would have us believe. In an article published in 1965, the late Paul Demieville briefly surveyed the historical evolution of the treatment of mountains in The original version of this article was prepared for presentation at the Con- ference on the Evolution of shih Poetry from the Han through the T'ang, held at Breckinridge Conference Center, York, Maine, June 9-14, 1982. 1 Le T'ai chan; essai de monographie d'un culte chinois (Paris, 1910), 3. Chavannes' treatise remains one of the true monuments of Western sinology, standing at the head of a scholarly tradition-more influential in Europe than in America-that has sought to accord religion its due importance in studies of ancient and medieval China. Since, however, Chavannes neglected to discuss the shih poems of medieval writers (or those of any other age) written about Mount T'ai, a significant gap remains in his great work. It is hoped that the present essay may supply this deficiency in a manner not out of keeping with the spirit of Chavannes' study. 2 Soymie, "Le Lo-feou shan; etude de geographie religieuse," Bulletin de l'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient 54 (1956), 1-132; Schafer, Mao Shan in T'ang Times (Society for the Study of Chinese Religions, Monograph No. 1, 1980). These two informative and fascinating studies can hardly be neglected by any serious student of medieval culture. 3 Paul W.

In the context of the present study, however, it is worthwhile to recall that as late as the first quarter of the fourth century A.D., Ko Hung X (283-344),5 that industrious collector of the occult traditions of southernfang-shih }5, did not see moun- tains as picturesque regions conducive to carefree excursions but as a "zone of sacred horror."6 Witness the following: Of all those who compound drugs for the sake of [pursuing] the Way, as well as those who dwell in hiding to escape from disturbance, there are none who do not enter the mountains. Yet, those who are not aware of the procedures (j) for entering the mountains many times come to hazard and harm. Hence there is the proverb: "At the foot of Grand Flower (C[LJ]),/ Bones of white are strewn in a clutter". ... Mountains, whether large or small, are in all cases possessed of divine numina. If the mountain be large, then the divinity is a greater one; if the mountain be small, then the divinity is a lesser one. Entering a moun- tain without being in possession of the [proper] technique ('*), one is certain to find calamity and harm.7 This passage begins Ko Hung's chapter, in the Pao-p'u tzu, on "As- cending [Mountains] and Wading Through [Streams]" ( 2 ), which includes descriptions of various spirits and dangers one may encounter in the hills and provides explanations of numerous ef- fective methods-along with illustrations of several potent talismans -which may avail to preserve one's person unharmed while so- journing there. We shall have occasion later on to examine more closely this individualistically oriented strain of sierran awe and mystery and some of the poems in which it appears. For the moment, however, let us concentrate instead on the state-oriented aspect of the great mountains-particularly Mount T'ai. In recognizing the "divine numina" of greater or lesser power that inhabited and energized the mountains, Ko Hung was only adhering to accepted tradition. The ethereal essences of the peaks-particular- ly those of the four (later, five) "marchmounts" (yueh ),8 at the cardinal points of the classical Chinese ecumene-had been pro- pitiated and sacrificed to since Chou times. In fact, according to the Canon of Documents (Shu ching SR), these primary mountains had first been ritually visited in the dawn of history by the great Shun # 4 "La Montagne dans l'art litteraire chinois," France-Asie 183 (1965), 7-32; reprinted in Demieville, Choix d'e'tudes sinologiques (1921-1970) (Leiden, 1973), 364-389. 5 On Ko Hung's dates, which are disputed, I follow Ch'en Kuo-fu NM?1, Tao-tsangyiian-liu k'ao MYM , (rev. ed., Taipei, 1975), 97, whose argument I find convincing. 6 The phrase is Demieville's op. cit., 15 (372). 7 Pao-p'u tzu nei-p'ien 4,9= Ag^ 17. la (SPPY). 8 On "marchmount" as an English equivalent for yiieh, see E.

Only Ch'in Shih Huang A- and Han Wu Ti AAIIV seem to have seriously attempted the feat and, of course, neither of them completed the full itinerary. The Marchmounts, among the most powerful of the deified natural forces of ancient China, had been regarded as important protectors of the state. By medieval times, only T'ai Shan-which had from early on been recognized as primus mons inter pares-still retained this attribute in observable fashion, for it was on its summit and at its foot alone that the grand feng k and shan f sacrifices were performed. Strictly speaking, these sacred rites were properly to be performed only by monarchs whose exceptional virtue had been validated by unequivocal signs from above and whose rule had resulted in the unquestionable attainment of an era of supreme concord and prosperity; the feng and shan were announcements to Heaven and Earth, respectively, that the sovereign had successfully fulfilled his regnal charge.10 Although tradition had it that seventy- two rulers of ancient days had carried out the sacrifices," in the eleven centuries from Han through T'ang only four emperors had the requisite confidence in their own merit to perform the rites. These were Han Wu Ti (in the years 110, 106, 102, 98, and 93 B.C.), Kuang Wu Ti )t1I of the Later Han (in A.D. 56), Kao Tsung 7 of T'ang (in 666), and Hsuan Tsung ; of T'ang (in 725).12 T'ai Shan was, thus, closely tied to the state cult itself. This is a fact clearly manifest in most of the medieval poems written about the peak. Let us look first at a poem composed in honor of the mountain by Lu Chi #I^ (261-303): 9 See Shu ching, "Shun tien" #. It is significant that the first office and title mentioned in the Shu is that of the szu-yiUeh VgV, denoting one of the highest-if not the highest-ministers of the sage-king Yao; it was to the anonymous incum- bent of this position that Yao went for advice on whom to employ to tame the great flood, as it was to him that Yao first offered to resign the throne (before abdicating eventually in Shun's favor). See "Yao tien" . 10 The classic introduction to the history of these rites is, of course, the 28th chapter of the Shih chi 4"=,. 11 Shih chi (Peking, 1972), 28.1361. According to a separate tradition, it was only the Yellow Thearch (Huang Ti *V), among the seventy-two ancient kings who performed the feng-shan, who actually carried out the feng atop Mount T'ai (Shih chi, 28.1393). 12 During this millennium, other emperors, such as T'ai Tsung kv of T'ang, seriously considered observing the feng and shan but realized-sometimes under duress-their unworthiness or, at least, the inadvisability of the action.</page><page sequence="4">226 PAUL W. KROLL A Chant of Mount T'ai Mount T'ai-how very tall! Farther and farther, attaining Heaven's Court! Its pinnacled apogee wholly distant now, With tiered clouds clustered gloom upon gloom. On Liang-fu, for its part, there is a hospice; On Hao-li, for its part, there is a pavilion. The shrouded route detains a myriad revenants, And the haunt of spirits collects a hundred numina. -But I prolong my chant by the side of Mount T'ai, With brave forbearance, projecting the sounds of Ch'u.13 In emphasizing T'ai Shan's height in the first four lines of his poem, Lu Chi is not only describing the mountain's physical altitude; he is also presenting the peak in its spiritual aspect-as intermediary between the mundane beings of this earthly realm and the more rarified and mysterious powers housed in the heavens. This is pointed up by his careful use in line two of the phrase "Heaven's Court" XS, which is a traditional, alternative designation of the important constellation known as "Grand Tenuity" tj?, representing the palace of Heaven's lord, with which Mount T'ai communicates.14 It is also well to remember here that, during the feng sacrifice, the spirit of T'ai Shan in fact played the role of intermediary between the emperor and Heaven.15 Indeed, Chang Hua 4 (232-300), a writer contemporaneous with Lu Chi, identifies T'ai Shan as "the grandson of Heaven's Thearch" ).16 We see that there is more to Lu Chi's diction in this line than a polite variation on the cliche "the mountain reaches to the sky." Or to put it another, and perhaps more accurate, way, there is more to that cliche itself, when set in its proper cultural and religious context, than we may be accustomed to realize: the sacred mountain, rising from the ground into the sky, is, quite literally, a locus of contact between the powers of Heaven and those of Earth. Nuances such as this, which would 13 "T'ai Shan yin," Ch'ian Chin shih h r4X (in Ch'ilan Han San-kuo Chin Nan- pei-ch'ao shih _ l ltk1 [Taipei, 1968] [all references to the "complete poems" of pre-T'ang dynasties will be to this collection], 3.4b (p. 436); also Sung-pen yiieh-fu shih chi t (Taipei, 1961) (hereafter rFSC), 41.5a. 14 See Li chi E, "Yueh ling" 1 p; Hou Han shu &amp;tAa (Peking, 1974), "chih," 10.3219; and especially Chin shu X (Peking, 1974), 11.291-92.

Much of this paper will be devoted to the attempt to recap- ture some of these faded-or unperceived-tints of meaning in poems on T'ai Shan. In line three "pinnacled apogee" (chin chi Ol ) is a direct verbal borrowing from Shih 259 whose opening couplet reads: "Exalted and tall is the Marchmount,/ Its pinnacled apogee reaching to heaven." We shall see variations of these classic verses employed by other medieval poets writing about T'ai Shan. The poem's second quatrain descends from the heights, to focus on two foothills of Mount T'ai-viz., Liang-fu ~Fg and Hao-li =f. The former had been the site of an imperial sacrifice to the Presider of Earth (ti chu JEtl) by Han Wu Ti just prior to that monarch's first observance of the feng in 110 B.C.;17 the latter was the site of a shan sacrifice by the same ruler six years later.18 The "hospice" and "pavilion" of lines five and six are remnants of the martial emperor's temporary habitation at these knolls. But they are also, within the setting of the poem, suggestive of the dark gathering-place of the "revenants" (kuei A) and "numina" (ling i) of the next two lines. For it was a popular belief, since at least Late Han times, that upon death one's souls returned to Hao-li ("Wormwood Village")19 or to the other low hills near T'ai Shan's base. The poem is therefore divided equally, giving us a dual view of Mount T'ai: the first qua- train shows the celestial connection of the towering mountain, the second quatrain exhibits its earthly and nether affiliations. The concluding couplet of the piece portrays the poet himself, undaunted by the awful spectacle of T'ai Shan, giving voice to his defiant song.20 17 Shih chi, 28.1398. 18 Ibid., 28.1402. In this year, only the shan sacrifice was carried out, unac- companied by the feng. 19 There remains an old song from Han times, called "Hao-li," whose four lines (in 5-7-7-7 syllabic count) read roughly as follows: Wormwood Village is the land of everyone's home, Which brings together all souls, whether they be wise or stupid. Ghostly sires-oh how they are hurried on and hastened! The fates of men cannot for a moment hesitate or halt. TFSC, 27.5b. "Hao-li" is the traditional companion piece of the song "Hsieh lu" (ASS, "Shallot Dew"). Both were mourners' songs. 20 "Defiant" because "prolonged," just as the poet's very vitality is itself a defiance in this place ("by the side of Mount T'ai," i.e., at its foot) of expired lives. The "sounds of Ch'u" (X%) were traditionally distinguished by their resolute and zealous tones. Note that Lu Chi's own background (he hailed from the south) was such as to enable him to consider himself poetically, with a little stretching of geographical fact, a native of Ch'u. But perhaps there is also in this poem a political and topical undercurrent that escapes us today. 227</page><page sequence="6">PAUL W. KROLL Somewhat over a century after Lu Chi's death, Hsieh Ling-yiin S4-~ (385-433) also wrote a "Chant of Mount T'ai." His version goes as follows: Tai the Revered-flourishing is the Marchmount; Sublimely spiring, to pierce the cloudy heavens. Precipitous and acclivitous, both hazardous and high; Its jostled rocks, in every case luxuriant and lush. Ascending for thefeng-interment at the exalted altar; Descending for the shan-a cache at Solemn State. Stone Wicket is very obscure and hazy; And in the Hall of Light a numinous tract is secreted.21 This poem, too, begins with an emphasis on T'ai Shan's great height.22 And, again as in Lu Chi's poem, we hear an echo of Shih 259-in the consciously archaic diction that ends the opening verse ("flourishing is the Marchmount" ¢iH; cf. "Eminent and tall is the Marchmount" ;i 23). We are not surprised either to come upon references, in lines five and six, to the feng and shan sacrifices. In the second half of the poem, however, Hsieh Ling- yiin's strict adherence to syntactic parallelism as a principle for organizing the couplets of the work seems to lead him into a static and rather unsatisfying closure. Yet, these last lines are productive of two ingenious onomastical juxtapositions that display the poet's knowledge of "official" T'ai Shan lore. First, we have the clever matching of the "exalted altar" (ch'ung t'an Y) where the em- peror's report to Heaven would be buried, with "Solemn State" (Su-jan t), the proper name-here semantically revivified-of the hill at the northeast foot of Mount T'ai, where Han Wu Ti delivered his report to Earth during his first performance of the shan rite in 110 B.C.24 Next, we have the matching, in the final couplet, of "Stone Wicket" (Shih-lii Erf) and the "Hall of Light" (Ming-t'ang Mg). Stone Wicket, at the southern foot of T'ai Shan, was where the shan sacrifice of 102 B.C. was carried out.25 The Hall of Light referred to here is the structure erected at the northeast base of the mountain in 107 B.C., at Han Wu Ti's behest. He had been convinced that, in having this symbolic edifice (the prototype of which, according to devoted Ju-ist scholars, had first been raised 21 Ch'uan Sung shih ~i , 3.2b (p. 800); rFSC, 41.5a/b. 22 In fact, it is not a particularly lofty mountain, measuring only 1524 meters (about 5000') above sea-level. 23 This use of E as a copula is a feature of archaic texts, used in medieval times only for antique effect. 24 Shih chi, 28.1398. 25 Ibid., 28.1403. 228</page><page sequence="7">THE ASCENT OF T 'Al SHAN 229 by the legendary culture-hero Shen Nung 4jif) built on this spot, he was siting his Ming-t'ang precisely where that of the Yellow Thearch (Huang Ti ) had been many, many centuries ago.26 The name by which T'ai Shan is called in the opening words of Hsieh's poem-Tai Tsung f -deserves some attention also. The second element in the name poses no problems: it means "revered ancestor" and indicates T'ai Shan's senior position among all the mountains of China. The key term is the first element of the phrase, tai, which may stand alone in reference to the sacred mountain. I have left it untranslated in my rendering of the poem. But the significance of this name was commented on by various scholars during the first centuries of our era. Hsu Shen 14;h (fl. 100) takes what seems to be the simplest view: tai t merely means "the Greatest Mountain" (t'ai shan hCL).27 If we follow Hsii's somewhat tautological definition, we might wish to English the word as "Para- mount." Other writers, however, had different, more suggestive explanations of the name. Ying Shao (fi. 178), for instance, glosses tai f; (archaic *d'ai) as t'ai (*t'di), "womb" or "gesta- tor."28 This definition is not as odd or fanciful as it may at first glance appear: lexicographical tradition, at least, verified the idea that mountains were conspicuous loci of nascent life. Thus, Hsu Shen defines the general term shan (*sdn) XU, "mountain," as hsiian (*siwdn) a, "diffuser," explaining that it "diffuses vital breath, dispersing and engendering the myriad beings" ( ; ttt).29 And Liu Hsi wasJ, (late 2nd/early 3rd-c.) in his Shih ming t glosses *san, "mountain," paronomastically as *san pi, "generant."30 Mount T'ai was naturally assumed to possess this life-giving quality in greater abundance than other heights, since it was the March- mount of the East, the east being regarded as the cardinal direction of incience for all creatures. One therefore sees why the souls of the newly dead were believed to make their way to T'ai Shan: they are returning back to their original place of animation. Closely related to these ideas is the definition given the character tai t by Ts'ui Ling-en W , (fl. 520), one of the greatest classical scholars and teachers of the first half of the sixth century. He derives the word from the phrase tai-hsieh AX "to supersede successively," and 26 Henri Maspero, "Le Ming-t'ang et la crise religieuse chinoise avant les Han," Melanges chinois et bouddhiques 9 (1951), 4-5. The building is described in Shih chi, 28.1401; this description is repeated verbatim in the sixth-century Shui ching chu 41M: (Taipei, 1962), 24.314. 27 Shuo-wen chieh-tzu ku-lin &amp;3ZWrjft* (Taipei, 1976), 9B.5819. 28 Feng-su t'ung-i MAX, 1O.

KROLL explains that, since spring is the time when new life replaces old, T'ai Shan-as the eastern sacred peak (in the traditional system of wu-hsing correspondences, the east correlates symbolically with springtime)-is called Tai i because it is where "the myriad beings, born in turn, supplant each other" (j6kfI4Vftf).31 But it is easy to see that Ts'ui's definition is little more than an elaboration of the basic theme established by earlier scholars.32 Deriving tai t from the sense of tai ft, then, we have a name for Mount T'ai which seems to mean something like "Mountain of [Animate] Inter- change" or "Alp of Transition"-T'ai Shan as presider over the transmutations of life and death. Mount T'ai's role as arbiter of fate may be noted, after the obligatory opening lines on its sky-grazing stature, in the following work by the late fourth century poetess Hsieh Tao-yun -#4,33 entitled "Ascending the Mountain": Upborne aloft, the Marchmount of the East is high! Its flourishing apogee surges up to azure heaven. Among its cliffs are spaced the eaves of the void; Still and null-both shrouded and mysterious. Not the work of artisan, nor again that of builder, Its cloudy beams have been thrown up spontaneously! An image made from vital pneuma-what being art thou, That duly causes myself to be many times transported? -I swear I shall take up abode under these eaves, 31 San-li i-tsung E T, quoted in raan-chien lei-han MKiM (Taipei, 1978), 27.20b. This work was preserved through T'ang times, as verified by notices of it in the bibliographic monographs of the Sui shu P (Peking, 1973), 32.924, Chiu T'ang shu * ;X (Peking, 1975), 46.1975, and Hsin T'ang shu * (Peking, 1975), 57.1433. These notices uniformly refer to a 30-chiian edition, although in Ts'ui's official biography (Liang shu ; [Peking, 1973], 48.677) the original text is stated to have been in 47 chiaan. 32 In particular, the words of Pan Ku IW1 (32-92) in the Po-hu t'ung OAM: "Whereby is it that [the king] is obliged to [perform the feng-shan] at T'ai Shan? [Because] it is the inceptor of the myriad beings, the place of successive inter- change" ( 4[flf3J. ;t724, 3fk.th).

For her biography, see Chin shu, 96.2516-17. Her father was Hsieh I M34j (d. 358), close companion of the dictator Huan Wen IBii ; her brother was the famous general Hsieh Hsiuan MA, and her paternal uncle the great statesman Hsieh An M. She was married to Wang Ning-chih 3LS, son of the renowned calligrapher Wang Hsi-chih TE&amp;i. The poem quoted here is one of only three by her that remain to us.

Hsieh Tao-yiin accepts this convention in the first couplet of her poem, while fashioning her own variation.35 In the lines that follow, the lady contrives a poem that-in my view-is more successful and tightly-knit than either Lu Chi's or Hsieh Ling-yiin's effort. Especially interesting in the present context is the descriptive epithet addressed to the mountain itself in line seven-"An image made from vital pneuma." The two-word Chinese phrase that this rendering attempts to capture is ch'i hsiang t It is of course quite possible to read the phrase simply as "A vapor- ous shape" or "A vaporous simulacrum"-portraying the contours of the mountain wrapped in mist.36 But I believe there is more involved here: the image behind the poet's diction in this case is surely Hsii Shen's familiar (to a medieval writer) definition of mountains as "diffusers of vital breath" (hsian ch'i ') which give life to all creatures. To Hsieh Tao-yiin, T'ai Shan is a symbolic figure that has been formed "spontaneously"-"Not the work of artisan, nor again that of builder"-from life-giving pneuma. Nicely done also in this piece is the careful patterning of the architec- tural imagery ("eaves," "artisan," "builder," "beams," and "eaves" again) that finally leads to the poet's vow to make the mountain her "abode."37 Our sampling of pre-T'ang verses on Mount T'ai, and some of the cultural, religious, and lexical background to them, has perhaps given us now an adequate perspective from which to view the handling of the same topic by Tu Fu ti± (712-770), one of the greatest of T'ang wordsmiths. The poem in question, which is one 34 "Teng shan," Ch'iian Chin shih, 7.15b (p. 670). 35 It may be that Hsieh Ling-yiin's choice of the word "flourishing" (hsiu 3) in the opening line of his poem quoted earlier was inspired by Hsieh Tao-yUn's "flourishing apogee" (hsiu chi R&amp;), a variation of course on the classical "pin- nacled apogee" (chiin chi )fi) from Shih 259. 36 Cf., for instance, the line tEl Mft, "The sun shows forth and vaporous shapes resolve," in Meng Hao-jan's poem "Starting Early from the Tarn at Fisher's Reach," "Tsao fa Yii-p'u t'an," Meng Hao-jan chi S£i,, 1.8a (SPTK); see the translation in Kroll, Meng Hao-jan, 70. 37 Note that the phrase shih chiang St in the penultimate line (9t-t ) is a classical locution from the refrain of Shih 113 (5fJAC), meaning "swear to [do X] in future"-not, as one might be tempted to read, a reference to the soul's return to T'ai Shan at death ("Passed on, I shall ..."). The latter inter- pretation would, moreover, make no sense in conjunction with the final line of the poem. 231</page><page sequence="10">PAUL W. KROLL of the earliest extant examples of Tu Fu's work (most commentators date its composition to the year 736, when the poet was twenty- four), is called "Gazing Afar at the Marchmount": Tai the Revered-now, what to compare it with? Over Ch'i and Lu, its azure never ending. In it the Shaping Mutator concentrated the flourishing of divinity; Shaded and sun-lit it cleaves the dusk from the dawn. A heaving breast-giving rise to cumulus clouds; Bursting eye-sockets-giving entrance to homing birds. Someday I will surmount its incomparable crest- Then in a single scanning the host of hills will dwindle!38 To understand this poem's verbal craft properly, we must see it in the context of the T'ai Shan verses that preceded it.39 We may begin by noting how Tu Fu opens his poem, as did Hsieh Ling-yiin, with the declaration of Mount T'ai's alternate name-Tai Tsung. But he immediately breaks off, expressing his uncertainty over what course of metaphorical description to pursue-thus rejecting, tem- porarily at least, the standard formula used by poets preceding him, of explicitly extolling the mountain's height. However, he then proceeds in the second line with an image which indeed serves to suggest-but obliquely-the verticality of T'ai Shan. I say "obli- quely," because not one word of this line in fact mentions the concept of height directly: it merely says that the color of the moun- tain40 goes on and on, visible from both the states of Ch'i and Lu (since Mount T'ai was on the boundary between these two regions). Bypassing the now common images drawn from Shih 259, Tu Fu's vision here is reminiscent of a couplet from a different song of the Shih ching-viz., "Mount T'ai is steep and brant,/ Looked up to by the state of Lu" (% Ll , i Jfa), from Shih 300. And we are reminded, too, of the statement from Shih chi that "Sunward (i.e., 38 "Wang yiieh," Chiu-chia chi-chu Tu shih A t%ttf± (rpt. in A Concordance to the Poems of Tu Fu [Harvard-Yenching Institute Sinological Index Series, Supplement No. 14, Vol. II]), 1.5-6. 39 We will not, then, be induced to consider it a "Confucian" reworking of a vague Buddho-Taoist tradition of ascent poems (as does Stephen Owen, The Great Age of Chinese Poetry [New Haven, 1980], 188). As I hope the comments below will show, the poem is not an isolated or novel counter to a loosely defined tradition of "mountain verses"-it rather takes its place squarely within the discrete tradition of T'ai Shan poems. 40 Note that, while "azure mountains" are a commonplace of T'ang poetry, the color is particularly appropriate here, since ch'ing, "azure," is the symbolic hue of the east and T'ai Shan is the Eastern Marchmount. 41 Shih chi, 129.3265. 232</page><page sequence="11">THE ASCENT OF T'AI SHAN south) of T'ai Shan is Lu, shadeward (i.e., north) of it is Ch'i."41 Line three of the poem affirms the sacred nature of Mount T'ai, preeminent among alpine divinities; it owes its prominence to, and is the handiwork of, the mysterious selecting and synthesizing principle of Nature, known as the "Shaping Mutator" (tsao hua f{L).42 We should also note specially here the epithet "flourishing" (hsiu 3), encountered already in the T'ai Shan verses of Hsieh Tao-yiin and Hsieh Ling-yun. Tu Fu, however, uses the word not- as did his Mount T'ai predecessors-to describe the upward flower- ing elevation of the peak but rather to describe the complete and perfect holiness of the mountain. But this phrase, shen hsiu ji1 ("flourishing of divinity"), was not original with Tu Fu, either; in this, the young poet was appropriating a usage earlier applied to Mount T'ien-t'ai X J in Sun Ch'o's j, (ca. 310-397) celebrated rhapsody on that important peak.43 The fourth line of the poem points to the seemingly massive physical structure of T'ai Shan, characterizing it almost as an axis mundi, or at least an axis luminis, whose northern and southern flanks ("shaded" and "sun-lit," respectively) divide night from day. The lexical crux of the poem rests in the fifth and sixth lines (§18^JUS, BitlA.~, ,), where the poet's diction attains its richest and most compact density. (The reader may have noticed that my rendering of the lines is-intentionally-ambiguous.) The corporal imagery in these two lines has long been regarded by commentators as referring to the poet himself: he is so high up that the alpine clouds seem born from his chest, and his eyes seem to burst as he strains his vision to follow the flight of birds returning to their roosts on the mountain. Since this interpretation has been hallowed by centuries of critical acceptance, one hesitates to sub- scribe to a contrary view. Yet I admit I do not think the traditional interpretation accounts adequately, much less entirely, for Tu Fu's particular-and, we must suppose, careful-arrangement of words in this couplet. It is, of course, possible to read the lines with the poet as the 42 Also referred to commonly as the "Fashioner of Creatures" (tsao wu che ~A_). On the concept of this creative force, see Edward H.

KROLL understood subject, and it may well be that Tu Fu had this reading in mind. But at the same time it must be conceded that this reading poses some difficulties, both artistically and logically. Artistically, it is at least unnecessary, if not infelicitous, to shift the focus of the poem, which has till this point been wholly on T'ai Shan, so con- spicuously toward the speaker himself. Logically, this reading is rather problematic also in that, if we take it to be at the level of the poet's breast that the mountain's cumulus clouds come forth, we must assume the poet to be somewhere up the slope of the mountain itself. But if so, the title of the work ("Gazing Afar at the March- mount") is invalidated and, perhaps more troublesomely, the apparently long-range view of the homing birds in line six is called into question (for, why should the poet need to strain his eyes to follow the flight of birds that are coming closer to him?).44 There is, though, an alternate reading of this couplet, which seems to alleviate these difficulties. And that is to read the lines with T'ai Shan itself as the subject-in the same manner as it had been the continuous subject of the poem's first four lines. If we do so, line five resolves itself nicely: "Its heaving breast gives rise to cumulus clouds." But while most readers will have no trouble accepting this rather mild form of anthropomorphism, many may balk at the similar-but somehow more extreme-personification then required in line six: "Its bursting eye-sockets give entrance to homing birds." Here one must allow the mountain's imagined caverns or grottoes to be "eye-sockets" into which, when seen from a distant perspective, birds seem to enter. Presumably it is because of the eccentricity of the latter image that traditional critics have chosen to disregard this reading. And yet it is, in fact, no more unusual than the "dar- ing"45 inversion of normal syntax and the logical incongruities necessitated by the approved interpretation. I confess to being attracted to the "anthropomorphic" reading, and this for two reasons: it requires no undue wrenching of either the syntax of the 44 These problems are not, by the way, avoided by reading tang a as "washing; cleansing; scouring" (Middle Chinese *t'ang-) instead of "heaving; agitated" (*dang-). That reading could indeed place the poet at some distance from Mount T'ai (since the locus classicus for the phrase Y&amp;, with tang meaning "washing," implies a confrontational posture [see Chang Heng's '* (78-139) "Nan tu fu," Wen hsilan, 4.73: M*A?if]. However, then we must assume the poet to be on a mountain peak barely less tall than T'ai Shan itself, which would be clearly inappropriate in the context of a poem celebrating the "incomparable" March- mount. I think David Hawkes is quite right in reading tang here as "heaving" (Hawkes, A Little Primer of Tu Fu (Oxford, 1967], 4), although I cannot agree with him that it refers only to a "climber's" breast or that lines five and six are merely a case of "poetical inversion." 45 Hawkes, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="13">THE ASCENT OF T'AI SHAN original text or of the focused subject of the poem. The change of subject to the poet comes much more naturally in the seventh line, with the explicitly stated ("Someday I will ... ") shift from present observation to deliberate imagination. Still, I am not convinced that Tu Fu himself made-or wished to make-a clear choice between the two possible meanings of his couplet; we may be dealing here with a conscious ambiguity which gives a layered depth to the words themselves.46 However we construe the poem's fifth and sixth lines, it is plain enough that with these lines the poet's distant contemplation of Mount T'ai has reached the limit of its capabilities. In the concluding couplet he can only imagine the ascent of its summit, which he promises himself to make "someday." (Note how this votive ending resembles that of Hsieh Tao-yiin's poem.) And the view he shall then enjoy will affirm T'ai Shan's preeminence, in terms reminiscent of Confucius' experience ("On climbing T'ai Shan, [Confucius] considered the subcelestial realm to dwindle" 4-UIfYi/Jx'TF47) upon reaching the great mountain's summit long ago. Tu Fu's view of Mount T'ai in the preceding poem was apparently the result of a private excursion. We know, however, of at least two poets of the T'ang who came to the mountain on formal occasions, in the entourage of their respective rulers, for the feng and shan sacrifices. Lu Chao-lin hMi, (ca. 635-684)48 accompanied Li Chih &gt;' (posthumously Kao Tsung , reg. 649-683) there in 666 and has left us a set of four heptasyllabic quatrains, called "Songs for the Great Refection upon the Ascent for the feng,"49 which were composed for the celebratory banquet that followed Kao Tsung's performance of the feng on T'ai Shan. But the mountain itself barely appears in these songs; the poet's interest is rather on the 46 As far as I know, the only other scholar to consider seriously the syntactic and semantic ambiguity of these lines is Franqois Cheng, L'ecriture poetique chinoise (Paris, 1977), 180, who observes "En r6alit6, le poete cherchejustement a suggerer que le grimpeur 'fait corps' avec la montagne et vit la vision de la montagne de l'interieur." 47 Mencius, 7A.24. 48 His dates are far from definite; see Takagi Masakazu AtiE-- , "Ryo Sh6rin no denki to bungaku" S, ©(iM^O =S:, Ritsumeikan bungaku A~pXp T 196 (Oct. 1961), 777-809, esp. 777-785, for a conscientious attempt to establish the facts.

Hsuan Tsung A', reg. 712-756), also carried out the feng-shan. Coordinating all aspects of the imperial progress to, encampment at, and sacrifice on Mount T'ai on this occasion was the famous writer and statesman Chang Yueh W&amp; (667-731).50 It was Chang also who conceived the words for the fourteen solemn songs performed to bring down, welcome, entertain, and finally send off the divinity of the mountain during the rites on T'ai Shan.5' Chang Yueh further composed, at his lord's command, a long "altar hymn" (e@,) for the feng sacrifice, which was carved on a memorial stele at the Marchmount.52 However, these works, like Lu Chao-lin's four songs, are turned more toward conveying a sense of the grandeur and majesty of the emperor than that of Mount T'ai. We might remark, though, that it was on this occasion that T'ai Shan received from Hsuan Tsung the exalted title "Prince Equal to Heaven" (t'ien-ch'i wang i fi.)-an alternate appellation for the mountain which was to endure in official use long past the T'ang dynasty.53 50 Although Chang's dates are given in all reference works as 667-730, he actually died on 9 February 731; see Paul W. Kroll, "On the Date of Chang Yueh's Death," Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 2.2 (1980), 264-65. 51 For these lyrics, see "T'ang feng T'ai Shan yueh-chang," CTS, 85.918-920.

The Tai shih, in eighteen chuan, is the most comprehensive and valuable of all mono- graphs on T'ai Shan; Chavannes unfortunately did not know of this work. It might also be noted here that Chang Yueh was a practiced hand at putting words to official court music: he had earlier composed the lyrics for the songs to be sung in Hsuan Tsung's ancestral temple (see CTS, 85.920-923).

Prior to Mount T'ai's change of title in 725, the emperor in 713 had designated the Western Marchmount, Hua Shan, "Prince of the Heaven of Metal" (chin-t'ien wang +X&amp;F).

We shall now examine a divergent order of poems about this peak, poems that feature Mount T'ai as the setting for specifically Taoist episodes of trans- cendence and transformation. We begin with a poem by Ts'ao Chih Hfti (192-232), which effectively mixes these two aspects of T'ai Shan. The first five stanzas of the poem are very much in line t'ien wang .kE£), and Mount Heng { "Prince Administrator of Heaven" (szu-t'ien wang -1J3E). The five Marchmounts having all been raised to princely status, Hsian Tsung in later years turned his attention to several other peaks-in 748 Mount Chao-ying -,,j11l4 was made "Lord of Mystic Virtue" (hsiian-te kung .£-~~), and in 751 the following promotions were effected: Mount T'ai-po tf-II was made "Lord of Divine Responsiveness" (shen-ying kung $i1), Mount I fVrll was made "Lord of Eastern Stability" (tung-an kung ] ~), Mount K'uai-chi I|1&amp;j was made "Lord of Eternal Ascendence" (yung-hsing kung 7-K* ), Mount Huo tlll (the original Southern Marchmount of ancient times) was made "Lord Responsive to the Peerless One" (jing-sheng kung *if ), and Mount I-wu-lu fOjllI was made "Lord of Extensive Peace" (kuang-ning kung ~&amp;-#). See T'ang hui-yao Jltf#, 47.834-35 (TSCC) (and, in the case of Sung Shan, Chiu T'ang shu, 24.934), where the enfeoffments granted to mountains by all other T'ang rulers combined do not approach in number those bestowed by Li Lung-chi. Li Lung-chi's interest in properly denominating and dignifying these peaks was due partly to the fact that he was convinced the great mountains concealed within their rocky frames the terrestrial headquarters (the "grotto archives," tung fu i[Jf) of those sublime and perfected beings, the Realized Persons of the Heaven of Highest Clarity (shang-ch'ing [t'ien] chen-jen LhLf [t] kA)-the Taoist divinities who were the lords behind the stars above and the true superintendents of the holy mountains. He had first been persuaded of this fact by the influential "patriarch" of the Shang-ch'ing school, Szu-ma Ch'eng-chen .,;iCl (647-735) who is reported to have advised Li Lung-chi after the latter's 725 visit to T'ai Shan that "At present the divine bethels of the Five Marchmounts are in all cases for [the propitiation of] the divinities of mountain and grove; but these are not the true and real divinities [of those peaks]. Every one of the Five March- mounts has a Grotto Archive, within each of which are Realized Persons of Highest Clarity who have come down to discharge their responsibilities." In response to a subsequent suggestion of Szu-ma Ch'eng-chen, the sovereign decreed the establishment on these peaks of shrines called "Bethels of the Realized Lords" (chen-chiin tz'u RpNJ), in honor of these prepotent divinities. See Chen hsi fA (by Li Po &gt;M, preface dated 805), as preserved in the eleventh-century riin-chi ch'i-ch'ien ;j-- (HY 1026), 5.15b.

Urge on the carriage, shake up the worn-out steeds, Eastward to arrive at the enceinte of Feng-kao. Divine, oh, is Mount T'ai in that place! Among the Five Marchmounts its name is special. Arched and high-threading the clouds and rainbows; Upborne and abrupt-emerging into Grand Clarity. Coursing round about it are twice six watch-mounds, And placed atop them are kiosks ten and two. Above and below are springs of gushing ale, With stones of jade displaying their floriate blooms. To the southeast one gazes on the countryside of Wu; Looking west, one observes the germ of the sun. It is where cloud-soul and spirit are tethered and attached- In the passage away [of time], one feels this ongoing march. They who are kings, in returning their allegiance to Heaven, Devote to it (i.e., T'ai Shan) the completion of their principal deeds. In successive ages there are none who have not paid it honor, For the rites and litations have their gradings of quality. If one probes the divining slips, some are long-lived, others short; It is only virtue that "succeeds and furthers through persever- ance." Those that offered the feng were seven tens of thearchs, But Hsuan the August was the primary, unmatched numen. He partook of the aurorae, rinsed his mouth with cold-night damps, And fur and feathers then mantled the form of his person. Rising up and away, he trod the outskirts of emptiness; Aloof and afar, he ascended to sequestered tenebrity.

"Grand Clarity" (t'ai ch'ing jt.) is the formal designation of the sky we see-the nearest to us of the vertically arranged Taoist heavens.55 The twelve "watch-mounds" (hou tf) and "kiosks" (t'irg ~) that stud the mountain are mile- stones, set one li apart, which mark the route upward.56 Of the marvelous "springs of ale" mentioned by Ts'ao Chih, one at least, issuing from the eastern talus of the mountain, is reported still to have been pouring forth its liquor four hundred years afterward; a drink from it would cleanse one's mind of worldly impurities.57 "Germ of the sun" (jin ching fi ) is a kenning for the roseate clouds of dawn or evening; since the poet is looking west when he sees them, we may assume him to be viewing a sunset.58 T'ai Shan "is where cloud-soul and spirit are tethered and attached" because, as we have seen, one's spiritual essence returns there-whence it is sued-upon the death of one's body. This thought gives rise logically, in the line immediately following, to the poet's heightened sense of awareness of life's quick passage, expressed here in phrases com- pounded from the Shih ching and the Lunyu.59 The "divining-slips" referred to are those that, according to tradition, were to be found atop Mount T'ai and which listed the predestined term of everyone's years; Han Wu Ti was said to have once stolen a peek at his own.60 "Succeeding and furthering through perseverance" is, of course, a quotation from the opening line of the I ching;61 the import here seems to be that only a virtuous ruler could hope to enter into proper relations with Mount T'ai. Up to this point and through the next two lines, where Huang Ti, the Yellow Thearch (here called by an honorific form of his given name62) makes his appearance, as the first of the seventy-plus 55 According to Ko Hung, the zone of Grand Clarity commenced at a distance of forty li above the earth.

But this Huang Ti is not a pale and bloodless imperial prototype, a mere name from the mists of mythology. He is, or rather he becomes, following his ascent of T'ai Shan, a Taoist superman. Sustained on auroral clouds and chill brumes-ethereal fare-he undergoes a bodily transformation which equips him with wings for the ultimate ascent into the remote void of the heavens. For Huang Ti, then, the summit of Mount T'ai is but his last point of physical contact with the world of men. From there, lifting away effortlessly from this lower realm, he has become a true Transcendent (hsien {ij), matching in longevity the "Father in the East" (tung fu 1). This latter and, for the moment, enigmatic figure will engage our attention at greater length in the third section of this paper. For now it will suffice to identify him as the male counter- part of the powerful Taoist goddess Hsi Wang Mu S9EX1, "the Royal Mother in the West," and to appreciate the directional appropriateness of his connection with the Eastern Marchmount. The Yellow Thearch's ascension into the heavens had been the concluding element in at least one tradition pertaining to this legendary ruler. But in the normal account of this event, recorded in the Shih chi chapter on the feng-shan rites and thereafter amplified in various other versions,63 Huang Ti's translation to the celestial regions is always effected by means of a divine dragon, who gra- ciously carries him aloft; he does not make this final climb unaided, as he does in Ts'ao Chih's poem. Nor, for that matter, is the place of his transcendence identified as Mount T'ai; it is noted, instead, as the foot of Mount Ching #j W (in Honan). Ts'ao Chih seems to have been the first writer to portray Huang Ti in verse as a Taoist hsien. But perhaps more important for us is the suggestion of T'ai Shan as a site of spiritual-as well as phy- sical-transformation. In another poem by Ts'ao Chih, Mount T'ai is again the setting for a transmutation to immortality; but this time the fortunate being is the poet himself: In the morn I wandered to Mount T'ai; Clouds and fog were comely and coy. 63 Shih chi, 28.1394, where Han Wu Ti hears the story from the thaumaturge Kung-sun Ch'ing X3AYAP. This incident is not part of the more sober "annals" of Huang Ti recorded by Szu-ma Ch'ien in the first chapter of the Shih chi. How- ever, it and many other uncommon episodes are recounted in numerous Taoist biographies of Huang Ti, from medieval times. See, for example, Lieh-hsien chuan N1fW (HY 294), 1.2b-3a, but especially the more extensive T'ang dynasty work Kuang Huang Ti pen-hsing chi AXitV*d (HY 290) and the lengthy "Hsuan-vyuan pen-chi" f@f preserved in run-chi ch'i-ch'ien, 100.2b-32a.</page><page sequence="19">THE ASCENT OF T AI SHAN 241 Of a sudden I came upon two lads- The beauty of their features fresh and fine.

We ascended westward to a hall of jade- Loft-buildings of gold, streets of mallotus trees! To me they transmitted drugs of transcendence That had been fashioned by their divine radiances. They instructed me in their ingestion and eating, And in the cycling of sperm to supplete the brain. With a life-span now equal to metal or stone, For generations everlasting, it is impossible to age!64 Here we have a true encounter with divinity on T'ai Shan65-not, however, with the spirit of the mountain itself (that never happens in T'ai Shan poems) but with a pair of "Realized Persons" (chen jen jXR, the highest grade of Taoist superbeings, more perfected even than hsien; their boyish appearances are, paradoxically, indications of their extreme age) who find Mount T'ai a suitably numinous locale for their activities. The polypore plants they hold are magic mushrooms that are one of the ingredients in the transcendent drugs these two "divine radiances" will concoct. The white deer they ride is a conveyance often favored by Taoist gods when they must travel upon the earth (we will see it reappear later in a poem by Li Po). In the second half of this piece the two supernatural "lads" abruptly whisk the poet away to paradise, where they pro- ceed to teach him pharmacological and physiological techniques conducing to immortality.66 At this point we might recall our earlier experience of T'ai Shan as an alp of transition, a passage-place between life and death. From that perspective it is not difficult to see why Ts'ao Chih should pre- sent Mount T'ai as an appropriate site for Taoist transformation: 64 "Fei lung p'ien," Ts'ao Tzu-chien shih chu, 2.32a (p. 167). The poem is in tetrasyllabic lines. 65 Cf. M. Soymie, "Lo-feou shan," 2: "Les montagnes sont pour les Chinois des zones delimitees, des aires religieuses chargees elles-memes de puissance magique et oiu l'on va chercher le contact avec le divin." 66 On the practice of "cycling sperm to supplete the brain" (huan-ching pu-nao EMAN)-a method of preventing the ejaculation of semen, and consequent diminution of yang-essence, during copulation-see H.

KROLL the transition to hsien hood is, indeed, an existential alteration, re- quiring as real a metamorphosis in one's being as that undergone when one comes into or leaves this world. Ts'ao Chih was not the first poet to see T'ai Shan as an abode of Taoist divinities or as a place of encounters with transcendence- or transcendents. In the anonymousyieh-fu poem called "Canzonet on Striding Out the Hsia Gate" (0PW4rIU ), we find, for example, a seeker of "the Way of the divine transcendents" who pays a visit to the "Royal Father and Mother" (that is, Hsi Wang Mu and the Father in the East) in their joint dwelling, located in a "niche of Mount T'ai"; he then meets-still on T'ai Shan-the famous im- morta-l Red Pine (Ch'ih Sung 4) who "Grasps the reins, to act as my driver,/ And leads me to ramble above the heavens."67 Similarly, Ts'ao Chih's father, Ts'ao Ts'ao T (155-220), begins the first of his three "Cantos on the Pneuma Emerging" (iS') with the poet riding a chariot of wind and cloud, pulled by six dra- gons, "eastward to arrive at Mount T'ai," where "Transcendent persons and jade maidens come downward [to me] in meandering wander." He is then given a draught of "jade broth," fortifying him for his subsequent journey to P'eng-lai and beyond, eventually leading to the portals of Heaven.68 Although we are restricting ourselves here to shih poetry, we may yet remark a like instance in Huan T'an's g;S (43 B.C.-28 A.D.) "Rhapsody on Mountain Transcendents" ([Li{Wl), where we again see Red Pine, this time in company with his fellow immortal Wang-tzu Ch'iao :E#iA, sporting at "the terrace of Mount T'ai."69 The literary culmination of this motif in shih poetry is to be found in Li Po's F b (701-762) marvelous suite of six poems entitled "Wandering on Mount T'ai." In the concluding section of this paper, we shall apply ourselves to a close reading of these works. But before doing so, it will be helpful to contemplate briefly the specifically Taoist contours of T'ai Shan as they appeared in medieval times. 67 "Pu-ch'u Hsia men hsing," YFSC, 37.3a.

KROLL One of the most practically potent periapts of early Taoism was that known as "The Plans of the Real Forms of the Five March- mounts" (wu-yiieh chen-hsing t'u K#fjXRX).70 This talisman, men- tioned often in the Pao-p'u tzu of Ko Hung, kept its owner and his family from physical harm (especially-but not only-when enter- ing the mountains), through the good offices of spiritual emissaries sent by the presiding deities of the great peaks. These spirits also reported periodically to the lords of the mountains on the p'roper or improper conduct of the possessor of the talisman-this an out- growth of an ancient belief that the five holy alps were overseers of morality and guarantors of covenants.71 Following the Shang-ch'ing and Ling-pao SW reformations of Taoism in the fourth and fifth centuries, this talisman underwent a shift, or evolution, in character.72 As Schipper has stated, the "plans" (or "charts") of the five peaks began then to assume most importantly the function of aids to mystic orientation, allowing the adept to visit the sacred mountains in meditation.73 To one who would thus reach T'ai Shan in medita- tion, its "true form" is revealed as reproduced in Plate I, according to one medieval text. The source from which this illustration is taken identifies the lord of the Eastern Marchmount as the leader of 5900 congregated spirits, chief counselor of the hundred revenants, and controller of life and death. It goes on to describe his apparel as follows: 70 The different uses and traditions pertaining to the "cult" of this talisman have been exhaustively studied by K.M. Schipper, "'Gogaku shinkeizu' no shinko" :JDffi6Q)rAjf, Dokyo kenkyiu IAW5t 2 (1967), 114-162. 71 Ibid., 122-23. 72 On the Shang-ch'ing synthesis, which profoundly affected the course of medieval Chinese cultural, political, and literary history, see especially Isabelle Robinet's 1981 doctoral dissertation at the University of Paris, "La R&amp;v6lation du Shangqing dans l'histoire du taoisme," 2 vols.-an extremely thorough and wholly admirable study which is a treasury of material on all aspects of Shang- ch'ing Taoism. See also Michel Strickmann, "The Mao Shan Revelations; Taoism and the Aristocracy," T'oung Pao 63 (1977), 1-64, and Le Taoisme du Mao chan; chronique d'une r6v6lation (Paris, 1981). On the less well studied Ling-pao synthesis, see Stephen R. Bokenkamp, "Tables of Jade: Buddhist and Taoist Sources of the Ling-pao Scriptures," forthcoming in Melanges chinois et bouddhiques. 73 Schipper, op. cit., 142-44. The point is also convincingly made here that Joseph Needham (Science and Civilisation in China, Vol. 3: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth [Cambridge, 1959], 546) is mistaken in supposing these "charts" to be early exercises in contour mapping. In an earlier publication Schipper noted the symbolic identification in medieval China of the Five March- mounts on earth with the five viscera of the human body and the five planets in the heavens-all manifestations of the great thearchs of the five cardinal points (Schipper, L'emnpereur Wou des Han dans la legende taoiste [Paris, 1965], 29). Robinet, Meditation taoiste (Paris, 1979), 274-76, reminds us of this and also of the historically close connection between the Marchmounts and the "isles of the immortals."</page><page sequence="23">THE ASCENT OF T AI SHAN He is arrayed in a long azure gown, wearing a "Seven Correspondences" cap of cyan-blue and watchet; he wears a pendant seal of great luminosity and penetrat- ing solarity, and rides an azure dragon.74 Some additional details of dress and equipage are added in another medieval text which also informs us that the deity's surname is Ch'ang g ("Constant") and his ineffable name Ching-meng p3 ("Essential Germinator")-one notes the references here to a by now familar attribute of T'ai Shan. This latter text, by name the Most High Scripture of the Dappled Talisman of the Nine Incarnadines and the Interior Realization of the Five Thearchs, is an extremely interesting work from the Shang-ch'ing tradition, in which the sovereigns of the five sacred peaks are seen as keepers of the rosters of immortality. Two meditations-or visualizations-on the lord of T'ai Shan are described therein. Both are to be practiced on the first day of spring (the power of the east having then attained ascendancy), when the Lord Azure Thearch of the Eastern Quarter AT)aJ] -the god of Mount T'ai in his greater guise as Lord of the East-mounts his nine-dragon cloud-chassis of cyan-hued aurorae and, attended by twelve azure-waisted jade maidens, proceeds to T'ai Shan where he collates and certifies the celestial registers containing the names of Realized Persons and Transcendent Magistrates. In the first meditation, the adept who would have himself certified as a transcendent being is advised, after purifying and calming him- self and burning incense in his meditation room, to ingest the Dappled Talisman of the Nine Pneuma for Entering Wood with Chia and I PZ~A !.YSi ~ .75 He must then clack his teeth to- gether nine times (to bring to attention his corporal divinities) and visualize the Lord Azure Thearch descending on his celestial con- veyance into the room, filling the chamber with a densely stifling azure pneuma. In the words of the text, the adept must then Actualize as visible the center of the Lord Thearch's azure pneuma transmuted into a red light-like the germ of the year-star-doubly rutilant and splendidly luminous, which, descending from the summit of your head passes into your own body, the luminosity of its light penetrating and glinting amidst the space of one's lives sector.76 Then, conduct the pneuma and gulp it down nine times, 74 Tung-hsuan ling-pao wu-yiieh ku-pen chen-hsing t'u iSS~;V ']kWf l (HY 441), 2a/b. The same description is repeated in Wu-yieh chen-hsing hsii lun !TL ~F;i (HY 1271), 23a; and in the "Wu-yueh chen-hsing t'u hsu" :gEi rI[1ji contained in Yiin-chi ch'i-ch'ien, 79.2a/b. Such descriptions of the outfits of spirit-beings are a regular feature of Taoist "visualization" texts, necessary so that the adept can distinguish precisely which high lord of the heavens he is encountering in a particular meditation. 75 Chia and i are the two "celestial stems" that correspond to the East, whose "activity" or "phase" is that of wood. 76 The liver is the bodily organ associated with the East, just as the "year-star," i.e., Jupiter, is the symbolic planet of that direction. 245</page><page sequence="24">246 PAUL W. KROLL being conscious of a fumulous warmth within your body. Soon afterward, the red light will dissipate from within. Emerging from your nine apertures, it will return back en bloc above the summit of your head, where it will be transmuted to form an azure cloud. Be conscious of your own body residing within this azure cloud, and rise up along with the cloud. In a good while, you will be conscious of your certification [as a hsien], passing freely through space as though treading the emptiness.77 The adept will then raise his head and pronounce a rhymed incanta- tion, after which he clacks his teeth twelve times and swallows his salival liquor twenty-four times. The meditation is then finished. Re- gular performance of this exercise over the space of eighteen years will, the adept is assured, render him capable of proceeding in flight to the heaven of Highest Clarity. The second ritual to be carried through on this day, according to our scripture, involves the burying of a vermilion-transcribed copy of the aforementioned talisman, plus another incantation to the visualized great lord, and thirty-six circulations through one's body of the azure pneuma that fills one's room upon his appearance. This procedure is then to be followed by another, on the day of the vernal equinox, the date when the Azure Thearch presents his registers to the All-highest Lord Thearch . The meditation to be performed on this day will result in the god of T'ai Shan inscribing one's name on those registers before they are laid before the All- highest. It will also entail one's obtaining nine "divine lads" as familiars, as well as the acquisition of divine mushrooms that will appear for one spontaneously and the knowledge of all affairs within the myriad 1i of the Eastern Quarter. After eighteen years of practice of these methods, a dragon-chassis will come to enable one to mount the emptiness and ascend to the heaven of Jade Clarity.78 Similar meditation exercises are associated with the lords of the other four Marchmounts. In the Chen kao, one of the central texts of the Shang-ch'ing canon, it is recorded that the grotto-heaven below Mao Shan *[Ij-the most important peak for Shang-ch'ing Taoism-is the mid-point of a quincunx of connected subterranean heavens. We might expect the other four to be under the four "classical" marchmounts, but such is not the case: of the traditional quartet only Mount T'ai is honored with a link to Mao Shan.79 This too is surely an indication of 7 T'ai-shang chiu-ch'ih pan-fu wu-ti nei-chen ching t (HY 1318), 6b-7a. 78 Ibid., 8a-9a.

The mountain, however, was not a notable center of Taoist activi- ties in medieval times. In fact, among humans there seems to have been only two "gentlemen of the Way" remembered for any particular association with T'ai Shan. One of these was Hsu Chun g$14, who lived during the early second century A.D. Widely renowned as a master of divinatory practices, he was said to have acquired his skill in this art on Mount T'ai, having been taught it by Chang Chu- chun 4K-9R, a transcendent whom he encountered during a pil- grimage there.80 More closely tied to the mountain was Chang Chung 4,P,, a well-known expert in Taoist respiratory techniques who made T'ai Shan his home during the first half of the fourth century. 81 It was partly because of him that the bonze Chu Seng-lang kk (ca. 315-400) went to Mount T'ai in 351, establishing an important Buddhist monastery there that was to be influential for centuries in that region.82 I have not found the names of any Taoist "observatories" (kuan I) established on T'ai Shan in medieval times, although doubtless there were some: a late source records, for in- stance, that during the reign of "Empress" Wu of the T'ang (690- 705) the marchmount's own shrines were converted to serve the interests of the Taoist clergy.83 As befitted a mountain of such venerable sanctity, T'ai Shan was supposed to abound in jade on its upper slopes, gold on its lower- or so said the Shan-hai ching 4JMil, which included the mountain in its mythographical survey of marvelous alps and seas.84 And in a to Tu Kuang-t'ing tItI (850-933), the informed Taoist geo-mythographer of five and a half centuries later, Mount T'ai's grotto-heaven (called P'eng-hsuan tung-t'ien ;%AiAX and measuring a thousand li in circumference) did not rank among the ten "major" tung-t'ien, only among the thirty-six conventional cavern paradises.

A much fuller version of the incident may be found in Chang Chu-chun's own "biography" in T'zn-chi ch'i-ch'ien, 110.12b- 13b. Hsu Chun was one of the early ancestors of the Hsus that played such a crucial role in the Shang-ch'ing movement of the fourth century; see Strickmann, Le Taoisme du Mao chan, 88. 81 Chin shu, 94.2451-52. 82 On Chu Seng-lang's Buddhist establishment at T'ai Shan during the Six Dynasties period, see Miyakawa Hisayuki )WIIf,&gt;, Rikuchashi kenkyA: shzukyohen ,XiR v (Kyoto, 1977), 255-78, esp. 258-61 for Chu in relationship to Chang Chung. 83 Tai shih, 9.15b. 84 Shan-hai ching chiao-chu WOORit, ed.

KROLL now lost Taoist text, quoted in Chang Shou-chieh's W1Xq standard commentary (published in 737) to the Shih chi,85 we are told that Mount T'ai "teems with polypore plants, stones ofjade, sweet springs of long ichor, and dwellings of Transcendent Persons."86 At the same time, however, the innards of the mountain contain six prisons for the examination and ostracism of malefic revenants and spirits.87 T'ai Shan could be both heaven and hell. But for poets it was the forces of light that prevailed there. It remained to Li Po to compose the grandest and most vivid vision of the theme already exploited by Ts'ao Chih and touched on in various earlier poems, that of the transcendent encounter on Mount T'ai. The set of six poems he devoted to the subject was written in the early summer of the year 742.88 The poems are re- plete with Taoist references and terminology, much of which has been overlooked or inadequately explained by commentators, even including the admirable Wang Ch'i 33 (1696-1774) whose an- notated edition of Li Po's works is far superior to any other. Part of our task, in examining these poems, will be to restore to them their full religious context, which must be understood if we are properly to interpret Li Po's experience of Mount T'ai. The first of the series reads as follows: In the fourth month I ascend Mount T'ai; Its stones flat-the autocrat's road opens out. The six dragons traverse a myriad straths; Ravines and races wind in due course round about. Horses' footprints wreathe the cyan peaks Mount T'ai. The creature seems never to have been spotted on the mountain in medieval times. 85 On Chang's cheng-i IEH commentary, see E. Chavannes, Les Memoires his- toriques de Se-ma Ts'ien, I (Paris, 1895), ccxvi-vii, who notes specially that Chang's work is remarkable for the geographical information it furnishes. 86 Shih chi, 6.242.

It was just after this that Li Po journeyed to K'uai-chi where he became acquainted with the Taoist priest and poet Wu Yun Ri (d. 778) who was summoned to court soon afterwards and promptly persuaded Hsiian Tsung to send for Po as well. 742 was the first year of the T'ien-pao i~ ("Heavenly Treasure") reign- period, which had been inaugurated to honor the discovery of a celestial token vouchsafed the sovereign by the deified Lao Tzu and which witnessed the begin- nings of Li Lung-chi's avid attachment to Taoist hierology.

The grotto gates-closed door-leaves of stone; From the floor of the earth-rising clouds and thunder. Climbing to the heights, I gaze afar at P'eng and Ying; The image imagined-the Terrace of Gold and Silver. At Heaven's Gate, one long whistle I give, And from a myriad li the clear wind comes. Jade maidens, four or five persons, Gliding and whirling descend from the Nine Peripheries. Suppressing smiles, they lead me forward by immaculate hands, And let fall to me a cup of fluid aurora! I bow my head down, salute them twice, Ashamed for myself not to be of a transcendent's caliber. -But broad-ranging enough now to make the cosmos dwindle, I'll leave this world behind, oh how far away !89 The poet begins this first ascent of T'ai Shan (there will be others in the succeeding poems) by following the "autocrat's road" up the mountain-that is, the route taken by Hsiian Tsung for his feng sacrifice seventeen years earlier and by other emperors before him. It was traditionally the prerogative only of the Son of Heaven to ride in a carriage pulled by six horses;90 that Li Po is conveyed upward here by "six dragons" alerts us that his will be a journey even more magnificent than that of the sovereign.91 We recall, too, that this sextuple team of dragons had earlier wafted Ts'ao Ts'ao to Mount T'ai; thus there was literary precedent for their harnessing. But we note in this first poem of Li Po's hexad that the gates of T'ai Shan's grotto-heaven are initially closed. It is only halfway through the poem, when he stands on the mountain's brow, above the clouds and above the thunder, and moreover only after gazing far off at the 89 "Yu T'ai Shan," No. 1, Li T'ai-po ch'uan-chi ?t: (hereafter LTPCC), ed.

Belpaire, "Le Taoisme et Li T'ai Po," Melanges chinois et bouddhiques 1 (1931-32), 2-4, comments briefly on, and translates a few lines from, the poems, but his remarks are vitiated by his lack of first-hand knowledge of Taoist sources. 90 Sung shu 5k (Peking, 1974), 18.495. 91 As I have pointed out elsewhere, horse and dragon are congeners-differing symbolically only in that the former treads the earth, the latter the sky.

KROLL paradise isles of P'eng-lai and Ying-chou in the Eastern Sea, that images from the celestial regions begin to envelop him. The "Terrace of Gold and Silver" fixed in mind by Li Po92 is the same estrade remarked by Kuo P'u 3 (276-324) when that in- spired poet beheld P'eng-lai in the sixth of his famous series of yu hsien &amp;{W ("Roaming to Sylphdom") verses.93 Once this visionary contact with the higher realms is established by Li Po, the pace of events quickens. He stands now at the aptly named arete Heaven's Gate.94 In response to his "long whistle"-an old and respected meth- od of calling up desired atmospheric and spiritual phenomena95- a "clear wind" arrives from afar. But this uncanny breeze (it is a rarer, more remote wind than that which sounded through the pines on the climb up) is merely the herald of a group of "jade mai- dens" come from heaven's farthest bounds-or are they members of the troupe of jade maidens we have already seen as attendant upon the lord of T'ai Shan himself? These ethereal damsels, with their suppressed smiles, seem to share a private joke-perhaps they are amused at sight of the poet who has invoked their presence (he is not, as he himself realizes, "of a transcendent's caliber"). Never- theless, they have a celestial gift for him. The "fluid aurora" (liu hsia jEi) he receives from their hands is a supernal liquor, a draught of solar essence. A fundamental scripture of medieval Taoism, the Purple Text of the Numinous Writ (Ling-shu tzu-wen ti. describes the procedures required to obtain this pentachrome pneuma which, 92 William G. Boltz, "Philological Footnotes to the Han New Year Rites," Journal of the American Oriental Society 99.3 (1979), 431, has some pertinent com- ments on the basic meaning of the word hsiang ,, in classical texts. Often mis- rendered (by analogy, one supposes, with modern Mandarin usage) as "to think; thought," it properly indicates "to draw up a mental image, vision." 93 "Yu hsien shih," No. 6, Ch'uan Chin shih, 5.7b (p. 562). 94 Chavannes, Le T'ai chan, 45, also 46, fig. 12. 95 For the history of this technique, see Aoki Masaru FI*EE, "'Sh6' no rekishi to jigi no hensen" 1 M ) Aoki Masaru zenshiu e*9ER : Vol. 8 (Tokyo, 1971), 161-68; and Sawada Mizuho XU V,, "Sho no genryui" t'Diffi511, Thb shiikyc 44 (Oct. 1974), 1-13. An interesting early T'ang text, the Hsiao chih, or "Directives on Whistling," describes in some detail the different types of "whistling" and the proper times of year at which to perform them; this text has been studied by E.D. Edwards, "'Principles of Whistling'- Fi Hsiao chih-Anonymous," Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 20 (1957), 217-29. "Long whistling" is mentioned in many medieval poems but translators generally convert it into a dull "humming." For example, it is unfortu- nate that, given the scores of books and articles written about Wang Wei (701- 761), it has not been noticed that, in his celebrated quatrain "A Lodging in the Bamboo" ("Chu-li kuan," CTS, 128.1301), the "luminous moon" that appears in the final line of the poem has in fact shown itself in consequence of the poet's "long whistling" in line two. This is not just quaint "nature imagery."</page><page sequence="29">THE ASCENT OF T Al SHAN 251 when imbibed, suffuses one's body with solar energy.96 Li Po, how- ever, is here awarded it freely, an act of pure kindness on the part of the jade girls. It is significant that the word used for the transferral of the gift is wei A ("let fall"), a more causual verb than the formal shou a ("confer") usually employed in religious contexts to indicate the transmission of doctrine, scripture, or token. The poet's bowed head and double salute may seem mere politesse, but in fact are the ritually correct actions to make after taking in the "fluid aurora," as indicated in the Ling-shu tzu-wen.97 Similarly, the poet's acknowl- edgement of his spiritual unworthiness is not routine self-deprecia- tion (there would be no need to waste words over that); it is ex- pressed in the exact words applied to Han Wu Ti when he, though considered undeserving, was granted celestial secrets by Hsi Wang Mu some eight centuries earlier.98 Finally, we see in the last couplet another variation on the same passage from the Mencius-about Confucius' view from atop T'ai Shan making the subcelestial realm seem to dwindle-that Tu Fu had used to close his poem. But, while Tu Fu imagined that "the host of hills" would dwindle in his sight, for Li Po-energized now with solar essence-it is the whole cosmos that dwindles, and he feels himself ready to take leave of this paltry world.99 The second poem of the suite, only half as long as the first, presents a second ascent: At clear daybreak I rode upon a white deer, And ascended straight to the mount of Heaven's Gate. At the mountain's edge I happened on a plumed person, With squared pupils, with handsome face and features. 96 The original Ling-shu tzu-wen is scattered in four different works in the present Tao tsang; see Robinet, "La Revelation du Shangqing," II, 109-120, for analysis and discussion. The technique for absorbing the "fluid aurora" is found in Huang-t'ien shang-ch'ing chin-ch'uieh ti-chlin ling-shu tzu-wen shang-ching @R hiSeS*t 1:E (HY 639), 4a-5a. The ingestion of aurorae is an exercise predating the Shang-ch'ing synthesis. We have seen it referred to above in Ts'ao Chih's first poem; and Pao-p'u tzu nei-p'ien, 20.4b, notes the "cup of fluid aurora" given by a transcendent to one Hsiang Man-tu lEt,, which relieved the latter of all hunger and thirst. 97 HY 639, 5a. 98 Schipper, L'empereur Wou des Han, 1 1. 99 Arthur Waley, The Poetry and Career of Li Po (London, 1950), 17, in a very brief and error-prone paraphrase of the content of the first three poems of the series, misinterprets this last line as saying the poet was "not yet ready to turn his back altogether upon the world." His mistake apparently derives from reading yu pt, (*fLtJW) as "sad" instead of "far away." But the latter reading is con- firmed not only by common sense, but also by the comparable diction at the end of the poem "Hsun shan seng pu-yu tso," LTPCC,23.517: Yf ME-Lf, fU, whereyu can only mean "far away."</page><page sequence="30">252 PAUL W.

But he let fall to me a writ formed of avian tracks, Which dropped down aflutter in the midst of the rocky heights. Its script, it turned out, was of highest antiquitv; In construing it, I was absolutely unpracticed. Sensible of this, I thrice breathed a sigh; But the master I would follow has till now yet to return.'00 The poet's conveyance this time is a white deer, popular carrier, as we have noted, of earth-bound transcendents.101 Progress is being made in his spiritual climb: this time he "ascends straight" to Heaven's Gate, arriving there quickly, in the second line of the poem. And he immediately meets a "plumed person," an angelic sylph whose "squared pupils" confirm his great age despite his youthful features.102 This transcendent being wraps himself in clouds, wishing to avoid the poet's direct gaze. But he too, like the jade maidens of the preceding poem, turns over to Li Po an encouraging gift (again the verb is wei, "let fall"). It is a writing, and hence intrinsically more valuable than the auroral potion received in the first poem,'03 but it is indecipherable to him, being in "bird-track" script of ancient times (the earliest manuscripts were traditionally said to have been inspired by the observation of bird-tracks). The poet is left sighing and frustrated: the path to transcendence is not as easy as it seemed to be at the end of the first poem. He needs the tutelage of a "master." He must persevere.

Leaning against a high bank, I scanned the Eight Culmina; Vision exhausted its limits, idling in lasting emptiness. By an odd chance then I beheld the Azure Lad. His virid hair done up in twin cloud-coils. He laughed at me for turning late to the study of transcendence: My unsteadiness and unsureness have brought the fading of ruddy features. Halting I stood and hesitant-suddenly he was gone from sight; So careless and uninhibited-it is hard to pursue and detain him.104 The very first line takes the poet to T'ai Shan's peak this time. The "Belvedere of the Sun" (jih kuan El ,) is the southeast crest, from which the view of the rising sun was most spectacular.105 We note that Li Po can now "open up the barrier of clouds" that in the pre- ceding poem concealed the plumed person from him, and that his spirit-though not yet his body-is flightworthy now, its lift-off point "between heaven and earth" at the top of Mount T'ai. Gazing about, he sees the line of the Yellow River some two hundred 1i in the distance106 and casts his sight even farther, to the extremes of the eight directions. And now for the third time he is rewarded with an encounter with a celestial figure: no anonymous jade maidens or plumed persons this time, but the great Azure Lad himself.107 We have met this deity before, as the "Father in the East" in one of Ts'ao Chih's poems on Mount T'ai. It is time now to take a closer look at him. As men- tioned earlier, he is the male counterpart of Hsi Wang Mu, but that is the least of his attributes. He is known by a variety of alternate designations, among them "Lord Azure Lad, Supreme Minister" (Shang-hsiang ch'ing-t'ung chuin g "Little Lord, Azure Lad" (Ch'ing-t'ung hsiao-chiin E "Little Lord, Azure Real- ized One" (Ch'ing-chen hsiao-t'ung 4 zJ'), and "Royal Sire in 104 "Yu T'ai Shan," No. 3, LTPCC, 20.448. 105 Chavannes, Le T'ai chan, 60; also T'ai-p'ingyu-lan tc'T_JW (Taipei, 1968), 39.5a, quoting Ying Shao's Han kuan i Ag; .

Like those of Belpaire (n. 86), Waley's re- marks on these poems-indeed, on much of Li Po's poetic corpus-are defective largely because of his unfamiliarity with Taoist texts. It is a failing, alas, that mars nearly all modern studies on Li Po, whether Oriental or Western.</page><page sequence="32">254 PAUL W. KROLL the East" (Tung wang kung VIEE2g). In T'ao Hung-ching's L (456-536) systematized Taoist hierarchy, he delights in the re- sounding title "Lord Little Lad of Azure Florescence, King of the Eastern Sea, Master of the Lofty Dawn, Great Supervisor of Des- tinies, Supreme Minister of the Golden Pylons, Jade Conservator King of the Greatest Realization of Ninefold Tenuity" (Chiu-wei t'ai-chen yii-pao wang chin-ch'ueh shang-hsiang ta szu-ming kao-ch'en shih tung-hai wang ch'ing-hua hsiao-t'ung chun An .

His "virid hair" is a sign of his perpetual juvenescence, as are the "twin cloud-coils" in which his hair is bound (hair-coils being normal dress for a pre-pubescent boy). Unlike the jade maidens who had "suppressed" their smiles, he laughs openly at the opsimathic and already aging poet. But one senses that this is an encouraging mockery, a gentle goading, on the part of the Azure Lad, meant to prod the poet into greater seri- ousness in his Taoist studies. This is indeed the "master" Li Po "would follow," but again, at the conclusion of the poem, Li Po is left behind. The meeting with the Azure Lad has, however, fortified the poet's will to pursue the path of transcendence. Some of the happy results are evident in poem four of the series: Purified and purged for three thousand days, I strip plainsilk to copy the scriptures of the Way. Intoning and reciting I hold what I have won, As a host of spirits guards the physical form that is mine.

A sheen on the sea animates the distant mountains; The Cockerel of Heaven has already given his first call. A silvery terrace emerges out of inverted luminescence, Where white-capped waves roll over the long leviathan. -Where is one to acquire the drug of immortality? Fly away on high toward P'eng and Ying!111 The poet has now at last committed himself to basic practices-purg- ing and purifying his body and mind in long retreat, and diligently transcribing sacred texts. But what scripture is he "intoning and reciting" in the third line, that enables him "to hold what [he] has won," with "a host of spirits guard[ing his] physical form"? Although Li Po does not tell us, we can make a reliable guess. It is almost certainly the Ta-tung chen-ching k~JrA.iE or "Realized Scrip- ture of the Great Grotto." This most fundamental text of the Shang- ch'ing revelation consists of verses and incantations in honor of thirty-nine celestial deities and the corollary (in point of fact, identical) corporal spirits that watch over the mortal gaps in one's body. Recitation of the text, accompanied with proper "visualiza- tion" techniques, serves to fixate these corporal spirits and close the fissures out of which one's vital forces slowly seep.112 This is what Li Po is doing in the third and fourth lines. The Ta-tung chen-ching is a text that must be approached with great reverence: when Wei Hua-ts'un ft:, a holy mistress of the fourth century A. D. who would eventually transcend her mortal state to be apotheosized as the divine "Lady of the Southern Marchmount" (Nan-yiieh fu-jen MThW,5) and ranked in the Shang-ch'ing pantheon, was still study- ing on this earth, she was advised by the Azure Lad to recite this scripture but not before "purifying and purging" herself for five hundred days.113 Considering the far less advanced state of our poet, 111 "Yu T'ai Shan," No. 4, LTPCC, 20.448-49. 112 On the Ta-tung chen-ching (also called the Shang-ch'ing ching Ef-i), see Robinet, M6ditation taoiste, 151-160, and "La Revelation du Shangqing," II, 35-51. 113 T'ai-p'ing kuang-chi JCF1`6 (Taipei, 1976), 58.122b, quoting the Chi-hsien lu VWf (that is, Tu Kuang-t'ing's rung-ch'eng chi-hsien lu X4A, the extant version of which does not contain a biography of Wei Hua-ts'un) and the Pen-chuan tcf (presumably the lost Nan-yiieh fu-jen nei-chuan A See E.

KROLL it is not surprising that he should need "three thousand days" to refine himself sufficiently, before intoning the text. With his physical form now secure (momentarily, at least) against decay, Li Po finds himself capable at last of bodily flight and soars off on the wind-a plumed person himself. His airborne journey takes him, of course, to the top of Mount T'ai. (Contrast this aerial ascent with the three earlier ones-carried by dragon or horse, by deer, and on foot.) By the Belvedere of the Sun he looks out upon the Eastern Sea, as he had done in the first poem. The "distant moun- tains" are the enchanted seamounts of P'eng-lai and Ying-chou, shimmering now in the first light of dawn upon the waters. "In- verted luminescence" (tao ching fflt&gt;) is a phrase used with two different referents in Li Po's poetic vocabulary. First, it describes the play of reflected sunlight on water, used this way in two of his poems.114 Second, in two other poems, both with strong Taoist overtones,115 it signifies the farthest realms of heaven, out beyond the stars, where the light of the heavenly luminaries is seen reversed.1"6 In the present context Li Po seems to have combined these two mean- ings neatly: while the terrace of P'eng-lai appears to emerge out of the aqueous glimmer of the Eastern Sea, it is also true that P'eng-lai is a celestial paradise beyond the world we know. (Indeed, some late illustrations show the island floating in the air above the ocean or, again, placed upon an elongated pedestal whose base is below the waves but whose capital is in the heavens.) The "long leviathan" is the great sea-monster that was said to guard jealously the oceanic approaches to P'eng-lai.117 The extraordinary nature of the view taken in by the poet in lines 10-12 is emphasized phonetically in the original text by the fact that the last word of the odd-numbered line 11 ("luminescence" , Middle Chinese *kydng), which should not be a rhyme-word, here does match the proper rhyme-words of lines 10 ("call" a!, *mywdng) and line 12 ("leviathan" r, *gydng). This unusual phonetic correlation, although not strictly acceptable in the canons of shih poetry, serves to lay a special stress on these three lines. Surely this is a conscious action on Li Po's part, to make the lines sound as unusual as is the scene they describe. The poem closes with Li Po's voice hopeful and assured. He is ready to journey on to paradise. Poem five begins with the poet still on T'ai Shan's summit: 114 "T'ung yu-jen chou hsing," LTPCC, 20.451; "Ch'un-jih p'ei Yang Chiang- ning chi chu-kuan yen Pei-hu kan ku tso," LTPCC, 20.455. llS "Ku feng," No. 20, LTPCC, 2.56; "Ch'ou Ts'ui Wu lang-chung," LTPCC, 19.427. 116 This is the normal sense of the term in Taoist literature. 117 Li Po mentions it in three other poems: "Ku feng," No. 3, LTPCC, 2.45; "Ku yu so-szu," LTPCC, 4.119; "Tseng seng Chao-mei," LTPCC, 12.306.</page><page sequence="35">THE ASCENT OF T AI SHAN 257 The Belvedere of the Sun inclines north and east; Its pair of high banks-twinned stone hemmed about. The sea's waters drop away before one's eyes; The sky's light spreads far in the cyan-blue of the void. A thousand peaks, vying, throng and cluster round; A myriad straths are cut off from traverse and transit. Thread-thin in the distance, that transcendent on his crane- Upon departing he left no tracks among the clouds. Long pines enter here into the Empyreal Han, The "distant view" is now no more than a foot away. The mountain's flowers are different from those in the human realm- In the fifth month they are white amidst the snows. -I am bound in the end to come upon An-ch'i, Refining at this very place the liquor of jade.118 This poem is something of a pendant to the preceding piece, furnish- ing a description of the proximate scene, to balance the remote vista of poem four. Only a few remarks are necessary. We should note the emphasis in these lines on the solitary, removed, and superb qualities of Mount T'ai. It is sundered from all other mountains and valleys, its peak but a foot away from the "Empyreal Han" (i.e., the sky river, our Milky Way). The fifth-month snows on its lofty slopes are an indication of its extreme height (the summer sun cannot warm its crest)119 and also, even more importantly, an image of T'ai Shan's true crystalline nature, akin to the cold, white, celestial palaces of which it has become a visible, reachable simulacrum.120 It is here that the poet feels confident he shall encounter An-ch'i ?4, the mysterious alchemist of classical times. A seller of drugs in Lang-yeh W3g during the Ch'in dynasty, An-ch'i was reported to have had an audience-which stretched on for three days and nights-with Ch'in Shih Huang when that monarch was on his way to sacrifice at T'ai Shan (!). After this meeting with the prince of men, he took leave of the world, announcing that thereafter he was to be looked for on P'eng-lai.121 His ingestion of a personally compounded potion 118 "Yu T'ai Shan," No. 5, LTPCC, 20.449. 119 Interestingly, the Tai shih, 3.6a, comments that in the fifth and sixth months of the year one must still wear cold-weather, quilted clothing on the mountain, as the climate is like that of deepest autumn. 120 The symbolism of snow on holy mountains has been explicated, with special reference to Mao Shan, in Schafer's Mao Shan in T'ang Times, 33-35. 121 Lieh-hsien chuan, 1. 14b-15a; also Pao-p'u tzu nei-p'ien, 13.3a/b. In T'ao Hung- ching's official hierarchy, An-ch'i holds a place in the sphere of Grand Culmen (t'ai-chi t9c), just below Highest Clarity.

An-ch'i is one of the figures most closely associated with the tradition and transmission of this famous "liquor of gold" (chin i !r),123 so it is a bit puzzling to have Li Po identifying him with the "liquor ofjade" (yu i ,ik). I strongly suspect that thisyu i is a copyist's error for an original chin i, which has become fossilized in the text of the poem at a very early period; but in the absence of any confirmatory variora from other editions of Li Po's works, we must translate the text as it stands. Here again the poem closes on a highly expectant note, as did the last. But now the poet has discerned the true nature of Mount T'ai-it is itself a transcendent paradise; it is "at this very place" that An-ch'i and others of his kind are to be found. We turn finally to poem six: At sunup I drank from the Royal Mother's pool, Took refuge in the gloaming by the pylons of Heaven's Gate. In solitude I embraced the Green Tracery zither, At nighttime strode out in moonlight on the azure mountain. The mountain was luminous-moonlit dew was white; The night was still-the pine-tree wind had died away. Transcendent persons were roaming the cyan peaks; From place to place songs of reed-organs issued forth! In subdued stillness I took pleasure in the clear leaming, As Jade Realized Ones linked up on the halcyon heights. The image imagined-a dance of phoenixes and simurghs; Tossing and swirling-in raiment of dragon and tiger. Touching the sky, I plucked down the Gourd[-star]; Distracted and delirious, reflecting not on my return. Lifting my hand, I swished it in the clear shallows, And inadvertently caught hold of the Weaving Maid's loom! Next morning I sat in forfeit of it all; Only to be seen-pentachrome clouds floating away.124 In this culmination of Li Po's T'ai Shan experience the time of a full day (from one morning to the next) is contained, just as the entire spatial expanse of the mountain (from the Royal Mother's Pool at its base to Heaven's Gate at its peak) is traversed. To begin with, let us note the symbolic appropriateness of the place-names men- 122 Pao-p'u tzu nei-p'ien, 3.5b; the recipe for this elixir is recorded by Ko Hung at 4.9b-lOb. 123 Robinet, "La R&amp;v6ation du Shangqing," I, 13-15. 124 "Yu T'ai Shan," No. 6, LTPCC, 20.449.</page><page sequence="37">THE ASCENT OF T AI SHAN 259 tioned in the opening couplet. It is fitting that the poet begin this final ascent from the "Royal Mother's Pool"'125: as we saw at the conclusion of poem five, he seems sure now of his elect status and is consequently able to picture himself as starting out from-instead of merely ending at-a paradisal spot. Twilight finds him, in the second line, settling in on the threshold of Heaven. This is the first time the poet has been on T'ai Shan at night: the place is transformed as-he imagines-he is too. Evening begins with Li Po going out for a stroll on the peak, where he intends to amuse himself with some solitary music on the zither he brings along. The zither itself is no ordinary one; it is the famous instrument, called "Green Tracery" (lii-ch'i **)' that had belonged to Szu-ma Hsiang-ju WJ %4+I (179-117 B.C.), the magni- ficent rhapsodist of Han times.126 The scene is quiet-luminous and white. Even the wind in the pines, which we recall had sounded with a "poignant" voice in the first poem of the series, has subsided. But suddenly the poet is aware of other night-roamers on the mountain and of sounds behind the silence-the pipings of transcendent music! This shift of consciousness is deftly enhanced by Li Po with a shift of rhyme at this point (there are no rhyme-changes within any of the other poems); and it is a major modulation, across the binary divi- sion of deflected and level tones (in this case, from M.C. *-dk to *-ei), not merely a change of homotonic rhyme-groups.127 The festive gathering of "Jade Realized Ones" witnessed by the poet appears to him-as did his vision of P'eng-lai's terrace in poem one, which was the catalyst of his initial meeting with the 'jade maidens"-as a fixed mental image or conjuration. This nocturnal celebration resembles in part the merriment described in the Chen kao as enjoyed by the fortunate residents of the Azure Lad's domain: when those transcendent beings, whose bodies have the brightness of gold and jade, play their reed-pipes in concert, all kinds of animals come to dance before them and phoenixes harmonize their voices with the sounds of the heavenly orchestra.'28 But our poet is not to be a mere observer; he must join in the celestial revel. And he is now capable of doing just that. He can "touch the sky" and pulls down the asterism of the "Gourd" (our Delphinus) for a wine-stoup. Deliri- ous with joy, he thinks no more of the vulgar world below, at home 125 Chavannes, Le T'ai chan, 87-88. 126 Fu Hsiian fP4; (217-278), "Ch'in fu," Ch'uan Chin wen : 45.5b, in Ch'uan Shang-ku San-tai Ch'in Han San-kuo Liu-ch'ao wen (1886 ed.). 127 As will be evident, I accept the rhyme variants in lines two and four given in the Miao Yueh-ch'i PF1L edition of the text; Li T'ai-po wen-chi 4to&lt;;%, 17.9a. 128 Chen kao, 9.21b.</page><page sequence="38">260 PAUL W. KROLL now in the celestial regions. He swishes his fingers playfully in the Heavenly River's "clear shallows." But, quite by accident, he over- turns the sidereal loom of the Weaving Maid. (It is instructive here to note the precision of Li Po's stellar geography: the 'Gourd" [Delphinus] hangs to one side of the Heavenly River [the Milky Way], directly opposite the location of the "Weaving Maid" [our Vega] on the other side. If one were to flick his hand across the course of the sky river from the site of the Gourd-star he would in- deed risk catching a fingernail on the Weaver's loom.) With this unwitting blunder, the poet's wonderful vision, the fantastic revel, dissolves into nothingness. When dawn arrives he is forlorn, the only reminder of the night's Elysian gaiety the rainbow-hued clouds that now drift away from the mountain. Although this final work of Li Po's sequence on T'ai Shan has seen the poet successfully enter the realm of the transcendents, his careless behavior there has cast him out again. As he himself anticipated in the first poem, he is in the end "not of a transcendent's caliber." Despite the fond desires of the New Critics, no poem exists com- pletely in a vacuum. While we may rightly fault (as it has lately become fashionable to do) the bulk of traditional Chinese criticism for its predominantly biographical approach that diverts critical attention from the text itself, this ought not to lead us into making the equally parochial mistake of assuming we can understand a medieval poem properly without resort to all manner of extra-poetic materials. It is the most grievous critical myopia to suppose that, in studying medieval Chinese verse, we need only read poetic texts or belletristic writings. We must rather seek to know as much as possible about the entire cultural context of medieval times, that real and multi-faceted world in which our poets had their being. The study of literary history alone is not enough for this endeavor; we also must become familiar with the social, material, and, especial- ly, religious history of the times. I say especially religious history (including scriptures and liturgies, hymns and hagiographies, filia- tions, etc.), because it is the area that has been most ignored by students of Chinese literature-even though, as we are beginning to realize, it was of the most profound importance to medieval poets. The present essay represents a mere excursion into the overlapping terrains of medieval Chinese poetry and religion. Whole continents remain to be opened up or, in some cases, extensively recharted. Only when we possess both territories will we begin to see the magic and dignity of individual poems in their true fullness. University of Colorado, Boulder</page></plain_text>
