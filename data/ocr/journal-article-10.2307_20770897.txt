<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dominance of the Fittest The Animal Story in 1890s Cosmopolitan Magazine as Assertion of American Middle-Class Identity at the End of the Nineteenth Century Christine Mahady University of Pittsburgh The doctrine of organic evolution published by Darwin over thirty years ago at once offered to man a broader kinship than he had previously been able to comprehend. In my opinion the importance of this conception will, for a right understanding of the relations of man and other animals, outweigh all others, because it will bring us to see that, with a common origin, there must always remain numerous similarities of nature. (Popular Science Monthly, 1893) Late nineteenth-century periodical literature contains a proliferation of articles expressing a marked interest in relationships between humans and animals. No doubt, this preoccupation with animals was likely rooted in the more general attention being paid to science and the natural world during this period in time. Representations of human-animal relations, however, are not limited to the nonfic tion of 1890s monthlies; they also surface regularly in popular magazine fiction throughout the decade. In fact, short stories that center on animals ranging from dogs to circus elephants are a recurring feature between the years 1890 and 1900 in Cosmopolitan, one of the major mass magazines of this era. It becomes particularly interesting to consider the purpose of these stories in Cosmopolitan, a publication with a reputation for keeping its middle-class readers informed of vital concerns of the day such as international politics, education, and, most notably, scientific and technological advances.1 Cosmopolitan's inclusion of this kind of fiction proves even more curious upon a cursory reading of the stories, as they contain so little of the action or plot development that one might expect to find in a popular magazine story. These stories usually emphasize instead the interaction that takes place between animals and humans. The question arises, then, what function do seem ingly simplistic stories about animals serve in a magazine known for its critical participation in social issues? Upon close examination, I find that animal stories 127 American Periodicals Vol. 12, 2002</page><page sequence="2">128 American Periodicals contained in Cosmopolitan were engaged in an assertion of middle-class identity and dominance in an increasingly heterogeneous society. Richard Ohmann's Selling Culture: Magazines, Markets, and Class at the Turn of the Century explains the role that popular magazines played in helping to construct and consolidate the "middle class," or what Ohmann specifies as the professional-managerial class (PMC), at the end of the nineteenth century.2 Ohmann finds that, despite a lack of evidence to show that magazine editors were consciously constructing a PMC identity for readers, "the very logic of the publishers* economic project drove them to take part in PMC class formation... the editorial contents of the magazines had to attract a PMC audience for reasons based in the economics of the enterprise" (223) .3 Grounding his project in Marxist theory, Ohmann develops a framework that I intend to draw on in the present study useful for considering the relationship between periodical literature and the formation and assertion of class identity. Ohmann works mainly with Gramsci's theory of hege mony in refining his understanding of the workings of mass culture. In accordance with basic principles of classical Marxism that conceptualize the ruling class's influence on the "mental means of production,"4 the theory of hegemony holds that ruling class ideology comes to dominate other classes through institutions like media. Such institutions serve to legitimate the rule of the dominant class by making its interests seem natural, inevitable, and universal which, in turn, works to ensure that other classes will resign to their subordinate status. Hegemony theory maintains, however, that this kind of domination often operates through means that are neither direct nor intentional because to enact the kind of explicit manipulation that is implied by earlier Marxist theories would not prove to be in the best interest of the ruling class. As Ohmann explains, "the legitimacy of the social order in the eyes of subordinate classes depends on their belief that they are free and that their institutions?including the media?are open. . .. Thus the hegemonic process, when it is working well, is a system of rules that depends on widespread, active consent more than on force or manipulation" (46). Ohmann further points to basic differences in agency as a way of distinguishing Gramsci's ideas from those of his forerunners, emphasizing that the theory of hegemony views ideology as the "always contested and often inconsistent product of various interests and out looks" (47). However, the main value this theory seems to hold for both Ohmann's project5 and my study is its underscoring of the subtleties and complexities of the process by which ideology operates. In The Dream of a New Social Order : Popular Magazines in America 1893 1914, Matthew Schneirov argues that popular magazines served to prepare readers</page><page sequence="3">Dominance of the Fittest 129 for a "new social order" by providing them with the means for constructing "social identities/* as consumers, clients of professional expertise, and educated, nation ally oriented citizens (124). Of these identities, the one that the content of Cosmo politan foremost allowed readers to fashion, according to Schneirov, is that of the educated, nationally oriented citizen. In Schneirov's view, the most prominent features of the new social order to which he refers include the United States's role as a burgeoning world power as well as the substantial increase in industrial and technological advances taking place at the time. Supporting these conclusions, Ohmann notes that.articles in Cosmopolitan situated its readers "on the crest of progress" (246). Cosmopolitan's strong emphasis on the value of progress can be said to have played a significant role in the construction of, to use Ohmann's term, "the PMC vision of modernity" (258) on which this new social order would be based. It is important to keep in mind Schneirov' s sense of the work that Cosmopolitan was performing, as it will prove relevant to my analysis of magazine fiction later on. Moreover, building on Schneirov's premise that much of the non-fictional content of Cosmopolitan was preparing readers for a new social order, I would like to argue that the animal story in Cosmopolitan's fiction was also working to "prepare" readers for potential disruptions in the existing social structure produced by the changing composition of the American population in the 1890s. Specifically, I find this fiction to be engaged in subtle preparations to support its audience's assertion of middle-class uniformity within an increasingly heterogeneous society. To reach a more thorough understanding of these changes and their implications for the present study, though, it first becomes necessary to briefly review several pertinent issues which mark the historical and social context of the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. With moves by earlier activists for greater assimilation and integration of both African Americans and Native Americans, the body of people who could, at least in theory, participate actively in society and hold social and political power was rapidly changing as the century drew to a close. At the same time, the recent influx of immigrants was steadily contributing to a large underclass of unskilled laborers, giving rise to widespread anxieties among the middle class about the potential for lower-class rebellion (Altchuler 87). In Race, Ethnicity and Class in American Social Thought, 1865-1919, Glenn C. Altschuler offers his conception of a typical American response to increasing rates of immigration, stating, "To many Ameri cans, already bedeviled by blacks and the disruptions in community life brought by industrialism, immigrants heralded an imminent cataclysm. No longer knit together by religion, ethnic origin, culture, or even language, the frayed fabric of American</page><page sequence="4">130 American Periodicals society might soon be ripped apart by those who had little stake in the nation's "egalitarian experiment" (42). While the "genteel class" expressed disgust at immigrants' inability to conform to Anglo Saxon traditions, industrial and economic concerns gave the middle class even stronger reasons for regarding foreigners as a threat to "community homogeneity and economic security" (Altchuler 46). Altschuler similarly observes the fear of class conflict reflected in popular literature of the period. Citing Josiah Strong's book, Our Country, as an example, he notes, "Race, ethnicity, and class fused in Strong's troubled mind, [and] an ominous mass of nonwhite, non-Anglo Saxon, non-Christian people mired in poverty loomed on the horizon, blocking the sun like a cloud of locusts" (87). Certain academic, or "scientific" notions circulating at this time served to authorize hierarchies of race and ethnicity. Essentialist6 and nativist views that such theories gave rise to provided Americans with a means of dealing with threats to the existing social structure. Essentializing racial and ethnic differences7 allowed scholars of the time to render judgments affirming the biological inferiority of non Anglo-Saxon groups.8 George Cotkin rnReluctant Modernism: American Thought and Culture, 1880-1900 points out, "The popular evolutionary ordering of culture and race invariably began with the "low" and ended with the "high," charting the progress from savagery to white civilization. At the 1893 World' s Fair exposition in Chicago, the "best" research in professional anthropology, popularized for presen tation to a wide audience, helped to rationalize racism and modern imperialism through its hierarchical descriptions of the races" (52) ? In light of the conclusions of Schneirov and Ohmann described earlier, it is important to note Cotkin's statement that, "Increments of technological innovation, piled upon other marks of cultural or social improvement, moved a culture in a progressive, ascendant direction" (53). One of the effects of the emergence of theories legitimating Anglo-Saxon supremacy was the arousal of a strong nationalist sentiment within American culture, the subject of John Higham's Strangers in the Land. In his book, Higham puts forth his definition of nativism, as he asserts, "Nativism, therefore, should be defined as intense opposition to an internal minority on the ground of its foreign (i.e., "un-American") connections_While drawing on much broader cultural antipathies and ethnocentric judgments, nativism translates them into a zeal to destroy the enemies of a distinctively American way of life" (4). Fueled by these ideas of the inferiority of racial and ethnic minorities, many of Anglo-Saxon origin in the 1890s became concerned with the threat of "race suicide" and degeneration</page><page sequence="5">Dominance of the Fittest 131 of their "superior" race via the intermingling of blood.10 We note, then, how the convergence of fears and conflicts generated by the increasing heterogeneity of the American population may have functioned to support moves to preserve and assert the identity of a primarily white, Anglo-Saxon middle class at the century's end. Studies of nineteenth-century popular magazines indicate that magazine fiction often proves the location of further insight into anti-ethnic tensions.11 However, such studies have focused primarily on explicit themes regarding race and gender, examining, for instance, "courtship" stories or southern plantation stories. I would like to suggest that the animal story deserves special attention in efforts to understand the role of popular magazines in shaping middle-class assertions of Anglo-Saxon identity and dominance at the end of the nineteenth century due to its portrayal of potential "threats" to the social order through their fictional encounters with animals. Furthermore, these interactions become particularly meaningful when viewed in conjunction with non-fictional representations of animals and their relationship to humans in late nineteenth-century periodicals. Articles published in periodicals from 1890 to 1900 that demonstrate an interest in animal issues proliferated in periodical issues from 1890to 1900.12Like theories that establish hierarchies of race and ethnicity, the views expressed in these articles draw on scientific and academic authority for support. They express a strong interest in animals' role in promoting the progress and "civilization" of man. Emphasizing the likeness of animals to humans, the articles work to associate particular animals with particular groups of humans in a hierarchical fashion, finding justification for hierarchies themselves in nature. Establishing parallels between animals and humans, the author of one article addresses the impact of science and evolutionary theory on influencing popular conceptions about the relationship of animals to man, stating: It may safely be said that never before in civilized countries were animals?and especially our domestic animals?treated so well, be cause never before were they so thoroughly understood. To what is this to be attributed? Not alone to the spread of kindlier feelings and better principles generally, but largely to the advance of science. . . . The doctrine of organic evolution published by Darwin over thirty years ago at once offered to man a broader kinship than he had previously been able to comprehend. In my opinion the importance of this conception will, for a right understanding of the relations of man and other animals, outweigh all others, because it will bring us to see that, with a common origin there must always remain numerous similarities of nature" (Mills 47-48).</page><page sequence="6">132 American Periodicals Offering additional claims for man's nearness to animals are articles arguing that animals possess higher faculties of mind traditionally thought common only to man such as "aesthetic sense and religious sentiment." It becomes important to note here, though, that the animals said to hold these advanced qualities are primarily domestic animals and that the religious sentiment animals are said to hold is distinctly Christian, as "they readily appeal to them with the rod (Evans "Aesthetic Sense"476). This pairing of domestic animals with virtues of civilization and culture begins to establish the hierarchical terms used to classify animals and signal their implications for the human groups that become associated with those animals. The terms of such hierarchies become more explicit in other examples from the essays. The association of animal development with the developmental processes of "inferior" races is evident in one author's observation that, "the plastic and progressive period of the monkey's individual development is short, and that its faculties become set and stationary at a comparatively early age, is undeniable; but the same holds true of the Negro, who loses his educability and ceases his mental growth much earlier than the Caucasian. The longer or shorter duration of this formative season is, to some extent, a matter of race, but in a still greater degree the resultant of civilization" (Evans "Aesthetic Sense"474). Similarly, another author's argument suggests the potential of certain animals to surpass the progress of "inferior" races given animals' demonstrated capacity for civilization, as he asserts, "the statement that animal habits are fixed, and human customs variable and improvable, is true only to a very limited extent. Closer observation has shown the latter to be more stable and the former more mutable than is generally imagined, especially if we compare the highest orders of animals with the lowest human tribes. In primitive society and among savage races customs remain the same for countless generations, and seem to be quite persistent and incapable of change as animal instincts" (Evans "Progress and Perfectibility" 174). The most "advanced" animals here?presumably those proven capable of domestication?get associated with progress and are set in opposition to less "civilized" human groups. These formulations serve to reinforce the inevitability of racial hierarchies by connecting them to phenomena found in the natural world. Other articles identify in nature justifications for modes of managing and organizing social systems, drawing clear comparisons between human and animal "institutions," or social orders. As one author notes, "What we call institutions are only organized and hereditary instincts, and are common to man and the lower</page><page sequence="7">Dominance of the Fittest 133 animals_The original social character of animals, which forms the basis of their institutions is also the quality that renders them capable of domestication. Man simply takes advantage of this quality, and turns it to his own account by bringing the animal into his own domestic circle and service and making it a member of his household" (Evans "Progress and Perfectibility" 170). By rooting explanations of his observations of nature in evolution, the article places further emphasis on the necessity of uncovering a means of ordering both animal and human realms of existence, stating specifically, "These habits or customs have the same origin and character in the lower animals as in man, being in both cases products of evolution and undergoing modifications from generation to generation. Animal, not less than human, societies are governed by their laws and traditions and preserve a sort of historical continuity by which past and present are bound together in a certain orderly sequence" (Evans "Progress and Perfectibility" 174). These judgments regarding the value of modes of organization found in nature serve to legitimize the hierarchies suggested earlier in that such structures are designed to identify, categorize and control elements within a system for the good of that system. As their origin is located in nature, hierarchical structures themselves come to appear natural, inevitable, and universal. Finally, the configuration of animals as instrumental in aiding the progress of man's "civilization" in these essays suggests the ways in which representation of animals may be involved in maintaining hierarchies of humans. One essay in particular, "The Economic Value of Ariimals," describes the primary worth of animals on the basis of the products they produce for humans and the industries they give rise to that further assist humans by supporting the economy. Many of the products mentioned seem designed for middle-class consumption (especially for purposes of fashion?belts, hatbands, purses made from snake's skin; feathers from birds) which is noteworthy, as exercising power as consumers clearly becomes a primary way for the middle class to assert their dominance. Most importantly, animals are deemed essential to promoting the "civilization" of man?a "civilization" which gets defined here in very specific terms: "[The lower animals] not only provide us with food, raiment, and a vast array of industries, but they have been factors in the physical and intellectual development of mankind ... they have insensibly had a refining effect, and aided in the evolution of the higher and aesthetic senses. In a word, the so-called lower animals have been important factors in producing the high civilization which marks the Caucasian race of today" (827).</page><page sequence="8">134 American Periodicals Recalling the framework outlined at the beginning of this essay, the subtle way in which these hierarchical structures become naturalized proves consistent with the terms of Gramsci' s theory of hegemony. Similar cultural work, I argue, takes place in Cosmopolitan's animal story. In these stories, though, it is not only the association of animals with particular humans, but the interactions between humans and animals depicted in the stories that become significant in indicating the implications of this association. I will examine four of these stories here: "Another Dog," "The Den of the Grey Wolf," "Danny Nowlan's Experiment in Goats," and "Larry McNoogan's Cow." "Another Dog" contains minimal plot development, but merits particular attention for its portrayal of animals. The speaker of the story is a man vacationing at an inn who is watching two dogs from afar whom he claims must be talking to one another based on his observation of their encounter. It must be noted here that the dogs do not ever actually speak in the story (this is not, in other words, a "fantastic" work13), but the speaker's move to imagine the dog's capacity for advanced communication signifies an important conception of animals' likeness to humans. Similarly, the absence of direct contact between the man and the animals in this story becomes significant in that the dog is positioned in an independent space within the human social sphere where he is trusted to demonstrate his innate capability for protecting man's interests and preserving "civilized society," as the following examples from the story indicate. The speaker initially observes only one dog, a St. Bernard, who is responsible for guarding the archway of the inn and preventing any intruders from entering. In his description of the dog, the speaker specifically underscores the control function the dog serves in his capacity as gatekeeper, as he remarks, "His business was to sit still and guard that archway. Paying guests and those known to the family?yes! But stray mountain goats, chickens, inquisitive pushing peddlers, pigs, and wandering dogs?well he would take care of these" (87). The speaker continues to describe the dog in distinctly human terms, stating: The more I looked at him, the more his personality took possession of me. The exceeding gravity of his demeanor: his dignified attitude.... The way he looked at you from under his eyebrows?not eagerly, or furtively, but with a self-possessed competent air, quite like a captain of a Cunarder scanning a horizon from the bridge or a French gendarme, watching the shifting crowds from one of the little stone circles anchored out in the rush of the boulevards, was a look of authority backed by unlimited power.... Put a cap with a gold band on his head and he would really have made an ideal concierge. (87)</page><page sequence="9">Dominance of the Fittest 135 In an important turn in the narrative, "another dog" enters the scene, threatening to disrupt order, at which point it comes to be suggested that the dogs, in fact, represent different "social classes." The speaker distinguishes the other dog as a great Danish hound who "altogether was a dog of quality?of ancestry?of a certain positioning in his own land_Moreover, he was not an inn dog. He was rather a palace dog" (87). Based on these descriptions, I would argue that it may be possible to read the St. Bernard and Dane as emblems of the middle class and "aristocracy," or upper class, respectively. When the other dog becomes disoriented upon noticing his master's absence, the St. Bernard becomes the "voice" of reassurance, as the speaker recounts, "Then it was beautiful to see the concierge. With a sudden arching of the neck he reassured the strange dog?telling him, as plainly as could be, not to worry_Then if you could have seen that anxious look fade away, and the responsive, reciprocal wag of the night-club of a tail and the sudden peace that came into his eyes, as he followed the concierge to the doorway, dropping his ears, and throwing himself beside him, looking up into his face" (89). The "middle class" dog not only provides assurance, but he asserts his competence for maintaining order and exercising control over social relations. Although the Dane is designated "aristocratic" in the animal world, his symbolic position significantly shifts when he is perceived as threatening the superior order of humans. An interruption in the dogs' "conversation" ensues as a whistle from inside the inn startles the Dane, causing him to become bewildered again and, this time, to attempt to cross the archway into human territory. Contemplating the St. Bernard' s response to the potential intruder, the speaker notes, "Then it was that the concierge's manner altered. It was not gruff, nor savage, nor severe?it was only firm and decided ... he explained clearly and succinctly to that strange dog how absolutely impossible it would be to permit his crossing the archway" (87). The description of the dog here emphasizes his salutary impulse to exert control for the purpose of maintaining hierarchical relations of subordination and dominance. The St. Bernard successfully keeps the Dane from entering the archway, though in the final act of the story, he shows the Dane to an acceptable side entrance to the coffee room where his master is waiting. After the other dog finds his master, he returns to the St. Bernard to express his gratitude. Observing the scene, the speaker notes, "Then a dash and [the other dog] was around by the archway, licking the concierge in the face, biting his neck, rubbing his nose under his forelegs, saying over and over how deeply he thanked him ..." (90). Read symbolically, the story displays the triumph of and approval for the middle-class dog which results in the author' s ability</page><page sequence="10">136 American Periodicals to provide reassurance and maintain symbolic order through basing middle-class stability on minority difference. "Another Dog" also serves as a key point of comparison for stories which focus on different types of animals. "The Den of the Grey Wolf' takes place in a wilderness setting and centers on a conversation between two men canoeing one afternoon?the speaker of the story and his guide, Maxim. Though we learn nothing of the speaker's background, Maxim is described as living "in the remotest backwoods, having found himself at odds with society and the requirements of civilized life" (360). It becomes significant to note that the speaker suggests that the reason Maxim resides apart from "civilization" is because "perhaps there had crept into his veins a streak of Indian or other wandering blood" (360). In the remainder of the story, the guide recounts his experience of hunting wolves in an effort to receive a bounty of fifteen dollars for each wolf snout. He describes the harrowing details of becoming trapped inside the wolves' cave, but ultimately recounts his victory in slaying the wolves and managing to successfully obtain the bounty. Upon examination of this story, several important issues emerge. In sharp contrast to stories about domestic animals, wild animals here bear no resemblance to humans, as their value to man results only by way of their death when they become commodities for "civilized life" (a term which, as we remember from our reading of other periodical literature, gets defined in very specific racial terms). Wild animals are instead portrayed in the traditional fashion of being vicious and threatening which authorizes man's domination over them,14 a domination which is further celebrated for its enabling of the harvesting of commodities. Maxim's slaying of the wolf, for instance, is represented as a triumphant victory, as he recalls, "Just as the hole got so tight forme that I was about concluding to give up the job, I heard a terrific snarl right in my ear, and a wolf jumped onto me. His fangs got me right in the jaw. ... I thought I was about fixed. But I slashed out desperately with my big knife and caught my assailant somewhere with a deadly thrust" (362). Perhaps most signifi cant, though, in the story it is someone assumed to be at least partly Native American residing on the outskirts of "civilized" society who is suggested to be best suited for dealing with these untamed, savage beasts. Readily recognizable here is the surface, stereotypical association of the Native American with savagery and wild beasts, evocative of essentialia theories discussed earlier. More important to note, however, is the situating of the Native American in a relationship to animals and in a space that are immediately indicative of backwardness and antithetical to notions of progress. The place of Native Americans, then, is shown to rest outside?and</page><page sequence="11">Dominance of the Fittest 137 to remain, in fact, at "odds with"?the mainstream of "civilized life" in America. Recalling the arguments of Schneirov and Ohmann, the depiction of human-animal interaction here places the Native American in clear opposition to the PMC vision of modernity. The Native American's function, like the animals themselves, can only be to serve middle-class interests in the gathering of materials from wild animals that produce commodities for the middle class which, in turn, serves to secure his subordinate position. The story's illustration of the interaction between animals and humans operates on multiple levels, working first to placate audience fears about the potential effects of an increasingly heterogeneous population by affirming that the place of these "threats" to the social order is undoubtedly on the margins of society. Additionally, these depictions provide justification for keeping them on the periphery, as their actions with animals prove incompatible with the aims of progress and modernity.15 In "Danny Nowlan's Experiment in Goats," the speaker recollects an encounter he once had with Danny Nowlan, an Irish gravedigger, in which the he first came to learn of Danny's "experiment" with goats. Again, we are told nothing of the speaker's background, though the fact that he does not speak in dialect in the story, while Danny does, would tend to imply that the speaker is Anglo-Saxon. Danny's experiment refers to his practice of grazing goats over the graves of the dead; he insists that through this contact with the grave, the goats take on the characteristics of the person to whom the grave belongs. Though, as in "Another Dog," animals in this story are shown to be, in a sense, akin to humans, this likeness is swiftly undermined as the narrator ultimately dismisses the experiment as "lunacy." Because the encounter with Danny that the speaker relates is set in a graveyard in Ireland, it cannot be said to overtly assert "anti-immigrant" sentiment. However, the impression of the Irish that is presented here through his relationship to the animals may certainly be read as a reflection of fears concerning degeneration and as an espousal of the inferiority of Irish ethnicity. The narrator begins, for instance, by accounting for the reasons behind Danny' s experiment, conjecturing that, "Perhaps it was through some of the varied cross-strains which go to make up Irish ancestry, that Danny Nowlan inherited vague leanings toward the doctrine of the transmigra tion of souls. Maybe he had found intimations of the doctrine in sundry stray volumes of his schoolboy past, and the seeds of thought thus generated, left quite unguarded had become a warped and weird growth" (49). Danny himself is described as a "lunatic" and the "deformity" he is said to possess is reinforced throughout the story by the epithets "queer hunchback" and "wizened hunchback," all of which</page><page sequence="12">138 American Periodicals point to Irish inferiority and the potential for degeneration. Like the association of the Native American with savagery in "The Den of the Grey Wolf/' the essentialism of inferior characteristics inherent in such a portrayal is unmistakable. The use of dialect in depicting "the other," as Ohmann notes, may also be viewed as a device of class distancing (324). In addition, Danny's connection with the goats becomes critical given etymological16 and biblical connotations17 which mark the goat as a symbol of evil. Here again, though, it is his interaction with the goats that proves most significant, for he is not simply overseeing or taking care of the goats; his experiment with them depicts him as being "spiritually" in touch with them. That he is so spiritually close to such questionable creatures likewise casts him as a threat to civilization. Moreover, the "transmigration of souls" that Danny orchestrates is shown to result in chaos. The narrator states, "To my disgust I found the paths in every direction infested by goats! Goats browsed among the tombs, clanking their hobbling-chains over the graves of the departed (49). The suggestion here that the Irish are engaged in experimentation with evil and the cause of such disorder marks this group as being potentially dangerous and in need of control, justifying their exclusion from mainstream society. The most complex of the animal fiction in Cosmopolitan comes to touch on social and political realities of the 1890s. "Larry McNoogan's Cow" relates the story of a poor, Irish farmer in Illinois whose cow wanders into the path of an on-coming train and is killed. In the remainder of the story, Larry hires a lawyer who turns out to be deeply corrupt to sue the railroad. When he loses the case due to the unscrupulous dealings of his lawyer, Larry attempts to kill the railroad's attorney with a forty-four caliber revolver. Larry pursues further action, threatening to harness support to pass a bill that would limit the power of the railroad. The railroad ultimately pays the money in an effort to silence him and prevent any infringement on their freedom. "Larry McNoogan's Cow" bears much resemblance to both "Danny Nowlan's Experiment in Goats," in its depiction of the Irish as dim-witted and mentally disturbed (this story, too, employs dialect in portraying Larry) and "The Den of the Grey Wolf for its representation of the immigrant as backward and marginal. Not only is the immigrant here simply backward, though, his actions establish him as a genuine hindrance to the pursuit of progress. To 1890s readers, the railroad would have been a familiar cultural symbol indicative of technological advancement and progress. The railroad's collision with Larry's cow could be viewed as suggestive of the intense social and political conflicts between farmers and the railroad during</page><page sequence="13">Dominance of the Fittest 139 this period in time. Though human-animal interaction in this story is minimal, as it is the cow' s death that puts the story into motion, Larry' s relationship to the animal is what prompts his attempt to hold back the business of the railroad by perpetuating this conflict. Again, domination over the immigrant ensues and appears justified because of the threat he poses to progress. The political action he takes in the story is easily put down and he resigns to his subordinate position. Returning to the theory of hegemony, we note that associations and interac tions that take place in these stories between animals and non-Anglo Saxon, nonwhite characters all cast those characters as undesirable or threatening to the existing order of a primarily white, Anglo-Saxon middle-class readership in the late nineteenth century. The "other" in these stories is, in fact, always portrayed in a way to suggest his inferiority and, moreover, his problematic relationship to animals often makes this inferiority appear natural and inevitable, justifying a middle-class reader's assertion of dominance over him. Pairing racial and ethnic groups with particular types of animals that hold cultural significance (e.g., dog, wolf, goat) allows readers an immediate means of assigning value to and rendering judgments of those groups, which further works to reinforce hierarchies of race and ethnicity. Study of animal-human interactions here helps to enable a more informed under standing of the construction of middle-class identity in the 1890s and beyond. These stories also provide insight into the process by which ideology of the dominant class comes to subtly operate. Notes 1A brief examination of representative material contained within Cosmopolitan in the years 1890-1900 supports Schneirov's observation that the magazine's content would have beenhelpful in preparing readers for developments in the social order he describes. Subjects appearing consistently in Cosmopolitany s pages throughout the decade, for example, include United States involvement in international affairs such as the move for Cuban independence, educational issues, and technological advances in aerial navigation, steam cars, the railroad, and other modes of modem transportation. Cosmopolitan, Munsey's, McClure's, and Ladies Home Journal were the four major popular magazines of this era, in terms of both circulation and the amount of advertising they carried. The circulation of Cosmopolitan increased from 20,000 in 1889 to 100,000in 1892 and eventually reached 300,000 by 1898. For an extended discussion of the history of popular magazines at this time see Frank Luther Mott, A History of American Magazines, 1885-1905, vol. IV (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1957). Ohmann emphasizes that he does not wish to define this group empirically, as he posits that the PMC did not exist as a</page><page sequence="14">140 American Periodicals "recognizable or conscious formation" during the nineteenth century. In general, however, he takes this class to include "professional workers themselves, those who did similar mental work but without benefit of formal professionalization, mid-and upper-level corporate managers, their counterparts in government and other institutions, and highly skilled people who worked with numbers and technical processes" (119). Supporting Ohmann's findings here, John Tebbel and Mary Ellen Zuckerman in The Magazine in America, 1741-1990, point out that magazines, as the sole medium for national communication in the era before radio, motion pictures, and television, had the potential to reach an unlimited audience, though, as the authors explain, the magazine served chiefly as the "voice of the vast middle class" (77). This primarily middle-class readership held by popular magazines distinguished them from the more established, quality monthlies of the time like Harpers, Century, and Scribner's, which served highly educated, eastern audiences. 4Marx and Engels argue that the class which owns the means of material production inevitably exerts control over the means of "mental production," which include such institutions as media, legislative bodies, courts, schools, the church, etc., in an effort to channel its beliefs, values, and world view. Ohmann cites their statement: "The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas: i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it" (qtd. in Ohmann 42). As Ohmann points out, by the mid-nineteenth-century, the bourgeoisie had become the dominant class in North America, mainly replacing the aristocracy. 5Ohmann,s study concentrates mainly on the advertising and editorial content of popular magazines, though he also addresses fictional "courtship stories" and the fictional western. 6Anthropologist George W. Stocking, Jr., points out that although no coherent concept of race could be said to exist at this time, the following basis for assumptions about race was widespread in the 1890s: "In 1896, the processes and the problems of heredity were little understood, and "blood" was for many a solvent in which all problems were dissolved and all processes commingled. "Blood"?and by extension race?included numerous elements that we would today call cultural; there was not a clear line between cultural and physical elements or between social and biological heredity" (6). Explaining the common conflation of race and ethnicity, Stocking notes: "For both scholar and citizen, "race" was still a catchall that might be applied to various human groups whose sensible similarities of appearance, of manner, and of speech persisted over time, and therefore were evidently hereditary. The actual unity of such groups might be linguistic or religious or national, and in fact the same groups that were called races might also be called nations or people with little if any change in the degree or character of hereditary affinity implied" (7). 8Such theories of race lie at the root of Social Darwinist ideas that later took hold.</page><page sequence="15">Dominance of the Fittest 141 9See George Cotkin, Reluctant Modernism: American Thought and Culture, 1880 1900, pp. 51-73 for a discussion of specific anthropologists (e.g., Morgan, Powell, Ward) of this time and their theories of race. 10Altschuler notes: "If immigration continued, many feared that the Anglo-Saxon race might perish. Francis Amasa Walker, the director of the federal census, pointed to the fecundity of the newcomers in comparison to the natives. While immigrants were going forth and multiplying, Anglo-Saxon families, because they saw the virtue of lavishing attention upon a few children, experimented with birth control devices. If current trends continued, the race might well commit "suicide" as "survival of the fittest" gave way to survival of the most" (44). 1 !See, for instance, Richard Ohmann's Selling Culture: Magazines, Markets, and Class at the Turn of the Century, pp. 287-337, and Ellen Gruber Garvey, "Refraining the Bicycle: Advertising-Supported Magazines and Scorching Women," American Quarterly 47 A (March 1995): 66-101. 12During this decade, significant consideration is paid to topics such as animal intelligence, emotional qualities in animals, the progress and value of animals as well as a specific fascination with the domestication and taming of animals, all of which suggest further avenues for inquiry and research. Though articles of this nature are distributed throughout a range of periodicals which presumably addressed diverse audiences?The Atlantic, Outlook, Scientific American, North Atlantic Review?I will consider here four essays published in Popular Science Monthly between 1890 and 1900.1 have chosen these primarily because Popular Science was a publication that would have appealed to a similar audience as Cosmopolitan (i.e., the reader interested in becoming informed of technological innovations and ideas pertaining to progress). In considering these essays here, I do not wish to suggest that any direct parallels should be drawn between the essays in Popular Science and the animal stories in Cosmopolitan, nor do I mean to imply any relationship between readers of the two publications. Insofar as these essays may provide some indication of general sentiments regarding animals at this time, though, they offer us an important lens through which to view Cosmopolitan's animal stories. 13The suggestion of similarities between domestic animals and humans through the attribution of human characteristics to animals is strikingly evident in another story in Cosmopolitan, "A Dog's Story" (1897); however, the direct anthropomorphism in that story contains complications that lie beyond the scope of this project. 14Another short, simple story in Cosmopolitan, "A Tent in Agony," (1892) about an episode involving a bear and three campers casts wild animals in a similar light. 15This analysis resonates with Ohmann's explanation as to why popular magazines generally avoided directly addressing the race crisis in their articles: "The most dynamic and powerful groups in American society had, by the time of the magazine revolution of 1893, accepted the "common sense" of white supremacy and lost interest in debate over race relations, seeing them as increasingly irrelevant to the social project of industrial capitalism and to the PMC vision of modernity, in particular. Nor did the editors of the new monthlies</page><page sequence="16">142 American Periodicals want to cloud the sunny optimism of readers about their favored status and social mission, and about the new social order that had cast them as the bearers of rationality and progress" (258). 16Goat is a synonym for a lecherous man. 17"And as for you, my flock, my people, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will judge between one sheep and another, separating the sheep from the goats" (Ezekiel 34:17); "He will place the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his left" (Matthew 25:33). The goatlike features commonly attributed to Satan derive from the Greek pastoral deity Pan, who was half man, half goat. Works Cited Altschuler, Glenn C.
