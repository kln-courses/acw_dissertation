<plain_text><page sequence="1">TIKKUN SOPHERIM, BY REV. OLIVER TURNBULL CRANE, Princeton, New Jersey. There are various passages in the present Massoretic text of the Hebrew Bible which in the past have frequently been charged as willful alterations made by Jewish scribes in what may be called the true original text. These changes, it is contended, were intentionally made, in conformity with the traditional decrees of the ancient scribes, transmitted from generation to generation, for the purpose of removing certain objectionable anthropomorphic characteristics attributed to the person of Yahweh, which were shocking to the reverential spirit of a pious Israelite, and inconsistent with his exalted conception of the dignity, character and attributes of the deity; or, in other words, there were expressions in the true original text which the scribes deemed had a tendency to degrade or detract from the holy and supreme attributes of Yahweh. These, under the pious sanction of tradition, they deliberately altered, so as to bring the words of the Book into con- formity with their religious ideas. Whether this indictment is sustained by the evidence is a question for students of biblical criticism to decide. It is the inten- tion of this article simply to specify the particular passages thus arraigned, being prompted by the conviction that this specific branch of textual criticism has been hitherto unwarrantably neglected. The emendations above referred to have, in Rabbinical lore, received the name of "Tikkun Sopherim" (D*'D llf" corrections of the scribes), and are eighteen in number, confined to no individual book or portion of the Old Testa- ment, but occurring promiscuously throughout the whole body of the canon. Their complete enumeration is found carefully preserved among the compilations of the Massorah Magna and the Ochlah WeOchlah (8 093), or alphabetic lists of Massoretic comments or notes. Mention is also frequently made of them in the numerous writings of the Rabbins, with, however, an apparent apologetic tone, or with a somewhat labored and almost superstitious attempt at their justi- fication. This defensive position, during the middle ages, was in no small degree demanded by the writings of the celebrated Spanish orientalist, Raymond Martin1 (1220--1287), who directly and publicly charged these emendations upon the He- brew scribes as "willful corruptions and perversions introduced by them into the sacred text." As a fair illustration of the character and weight of these apolo- getics, we may cite the introduction to the Bomberg Rabbinical Bible of 1526, written by the eminent Jewish scholar, Jacob ben Chajim, of whom it may be 1 Author of a work entitled Pugio Fidei Christianae, published in 1278, in which he shows great knowledge and familiarity with the writings and opinions of the Jews, and combats them with keen arguments drawn from the works of their own Rabbins.</page><page sequence="2">234 HEBRAICA. truthfully said that, as an authority in Hebrew tradition and lore, he had no su- perior. A brief quotation must suffice. In refutation of the charge he says: "Thus it is that they (i. e., the Sopherim) made no willful changes. But if they (i. e., those making the charge) will persist in it in spite of what the Ga'on (i. e., Rabbi Nathan Ben Jachiel, 1030-1106, author of the celebrated lexicon Aruch f~'y ), of blessed memory, says, we can repel them with the power of the argu- ment as follows: Can any man believe that, if one intends to make willful altera- tions and changes, he would say, See what willful changes I have made, especially in the Prophets ? Yet we find the Massorah declares, In five passages the Waw (I) has been removed by the scribes (D*'D "JY), etc. Again, eighteen words are emendations of the scribes (0~1D 1i1n") etc. Now, if they had intended to make willful changes, they would surely not have proclaimed what they have changed and said, 'eighteen words are Tikkun Sopherim as given in the Mechil- tha' () 9 a Midrashic exposition of Exod. xII.-xxxv. 3, composed in the first century A. D.). Moreover, the Sopherim made no changes or corrections; they only submitted that the text ought originally to have been so and so, but is veiled in other expressions, out of respect to the Shechina, as you will find out by examining the subject. The same is the case with the Qeri and Kethibh ("?) gtp)1): they (i. e. the Sopherim) point out what they have altered, if peradven- ture you choose to characterize them as alterations. We, of the class of believers, however, believe that they all are a law of Moses from Sinai (i. e. the original readings) including the emendations of the scribes (Digg pp'13). But even if you still insist that the Sopherim did make alterations (09](D ff*), the alterations in question neither raise nor lower the points upon which the her- etics rest. Consult also the work done for Ptolemy, the king (i. e. The Septua- gint) and you will see that in the thirteen instances where they made changes, they state the reason why they have made these alterations, and what these altera- tions are, in what they did for him. In conclusion, the heretics can have nothing to say in this matter" (Dr Ginsburg's translation, 1867). For an exposition of the views heretofore commonly entertained by the Christian (as distinguished from the Jewish) critics on these matters, perhaps no abler exponent can be found than Johanne Leusden (1624-99) whose utterances in reference to the subject in question, have been, more than once, cited as of no little authority. We will therefore quote from his Philologus Hebraeus (third ed. 1686). In vol. I. under the section headed, De Ordinatione Scribarum, page 270, after having given a full list of the Tilkkun Sopherim, he continues: "Occa- sione horum locorum quaeritur, An ex, hac correctione Scribarum in octodecim illis locis non sequatur corruptio Textus HIebraici ?

Hanc sententiam approbat S. Jarchi in Comment. ad Geneseos Caput 18, ubi ait :--311~ '7 1 V scriberndum ipsi (Mosi) erat, Dominus stabat. Jarchi non asserit Mosen aliter scripsisse quam jam in Textu invenitur; sed judicat Mosen aliter debuisse vel potius potuisse scribere. Sapientes ergo Hebraeorum observarunt honorem Dei sive cohaerentiam Textus aliter quidem requirere; sed quia Scribae, hoc est, Auctores librorum ita scripserunt, ideo monuerunt talemn lectionem esse retinen- dam; et propterea dixerunt, Scribarum est ordinatio, sive ipsi Auctores ita ordi- narunt. In hanc sententiam etiam inclinat Buxtorsius apud Glassium pag. 57." This, it will be noticed, is substantially the plea of the scribes, only perhaps more perspicuously stated. And such practically for the most part remains to this day the argument (i. e. as far as any advance based upon thorough critical investigation is concerned), adduced by the very few critics who have at all given their attention to this question. As one of the many preliminary researches, necessary to a thorough sifting and proving of the Massoretic text, and as a further incentive to the study of the whole subject of Lower Criticism, as it is related to the Hebrew Scriptures, it the argumentative position of De Arcanis when he says "Galatinus lib.

Meanwhile leaving to others, better fitted to undertake the laborious, though far more important task of exhaustively inquiring into and passing final judgment upon the whole matter, which, though hitherto to a large extent overlooked, is now too important to be superficially treated or longer ignored, we proceed to present these emendations, in the order in which they occur in the Hebrew Bible, designating for conven- ience, the, what may be called, true original text, with the letter ) as an abbrevia- tion of the word ,n , and the present Massoretic text, with the letter j as an abbreviation of the phrase Ot")D 1P , and withal with a fixed purpose of confining the accompanying remarks and critical comments to as brief a compass as the requirements of each case will allow. I. First in regular order then we take up Genesis xvIii. 22. (a). "And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Yah- web still remained standing before Abraham (.t~ i7 1 p~T)." (?). "And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom : but Abra- ham still remained standing before Yahweh (;71;7 " j lY D; 113N 1)." It is absolutely .necessary that the context should be carefully studied, not only in connection with the above passage, but also with all others that may here- after be quoted. Indeed in this particular instance, the force of the immediate context has such weight, as to almost irresistibly impel one to the conviction of the probability and reasonableness of the reading in , and so violent (if the expression be permitted) is the rupture in the logical continuity of thought in f that almost any unprejudiced reader is constrained to pause after finishing it, and go over it a second time, impressed with the idea that he could not have read it aright. But mere probability, however reasonable, it must be allowed, unsup- ported by extraneous evidence of authenticity, will not warrant the adoption of S, in any case, as the true text. To the question, whether there is sufficient circumstantial and corroborative testimony, we shall have something to say here- after. For the present let us see what a few of the critics have to say ad hoc. Leusden in Philologus Hebraeus (3d ed. Vol. I. page 269) says: "Gen. xvIII. 22. "Ubi Abraham dicitur stetisse coram JEHOVAH. Judaei putant magis ad honorem Dei esse, si scriptum fuisset, et JEHOVAH stabat coram Abrahamo. Masora parva annotat esse D''I jli* .i* f"4 octodecim voces, quae vocantur Ordinatio Scribarum. Scribae cogitarunt: fotasse homines quidam hune Textum poste- riori modo legent, eamque depravabunt : ideo ordinarunt, ut omnes versum illum legerent, sicuti scriptus est, etiamsi Textus verba aliquid gloriae divinae videan- tur detrahere." Dr. C. C. H. Wright, in his work entitled, "The Book of Genesis in Hebrew" (London, 1859), has the following: "This is one of the eighteen passages marked in the Massora as D,"! 1p.pj In these passages the Massorites thought</page><page sequence="5">TIKKUIN SOPHERIM. 237 that there was something derogatory to the glory of God; e. g., in the passage under consideration they thought it would have been better expressed,-Jeho- vah stood yet before Abraham; but lest it should be read in that way, they have noted that the reading in the text is the true one" (page 60). Dr. Wright, it will be seen, has followed Leusden, as to argument, very closely, even to the verge of being illogical; for how is to be reconciled the state- ment, "In these passages [i. e., as they now read] the Massorites thought that there was something derogatory to the glory of God," and the words of Jacob ben Chajim as quoted above, viz., "that the text ought originally to have been so and so, but is veiled in other expressions, out of respect to the Shechina "? One can hardly credit the scribes with employing such contradictory lines of defense, though Leusden does charge them with declaring for the integrity of the present text " etiamsi Textus verba aliquid gloriae divinae videantur detrahere." It would seem as if these critics had not materially strengthened the position of the Rabbins. Far more frank and consistent, however, is the modern Jewish opinion on this subject, as expressed in the valuable commentary, "The Scriptures, Hebrew and English," by De Sola, Lindenthal and Raphall, published at London, 1844, where in Vol. I., page 96, referring to this passage we read: "Rashi remarks that ac- cording to the context it should have been, the Lord yet stood before Abraham, but the Massorites have altered it to the present reading. The reason seems to be that the expression to stand before another implies, in scriptural language, a state of inferiority and homage." The honest candor and almost anti-Jewish tone so prominent in the above comment, and considering the eminent source from which it springs, adds greatly to its intrinsic value, and contributes no little support to the position taken by Bleek in his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (2d ed., translated by Venables) Vol. II., page 459, where treating of the whole subject of the "Tikkun Sopherim," he, specifically referring to this passage, says, "The words, Abraham stood yet before Jehovah" (Gen. xvIII. 22), are a correctio scriba- rum for, Jehovah stood yet before Abraham. I consider that it is very probable that the latter is the original reading, for this mode of expression is better suited to the context. They were induced to make the alteration, because it was con- sidered unseemly to say, that Jehovah stood before Abraham, this phraseology often being made use of to point out a relation of dependence." The nature and scope of this article do not admit of further comment on this verse; indeed the limits of our alloted space will hereafter compel us to confine ourselves to little more than the bare enumeration of the remaining passages of the list. II. Numbers xI. 15. (n). "And if thus thou art about to deal with me, then slay me, I pray thee, at once, if I have found favor in thy eyes : that I may not see thy evil, ( ' )" i. e. the punishment wherewith thou wilt visit Israel.</page><page sequence="6">238 HEBRAICA. (j). "And if thus thou art about to deal with me, then slay me, I pray thee, at once, if I have found favor in thy eyes: that I may not see my evil (i)." The reason for this emendation (if it be one) is very readily apparent, for f was possibly liable to be construed as ascribing "evil " () to Yahweh; the removing, therefore, of this possibility would be forsooth a most sufficient justifi- cation in the eyes of the scribes for the correction. It is necessary here to add, that besides the reading in f given above, there is a second form of the last word handed down by the Massorites, viz., Opyi malum ipsorum, and what is remarkable, one of the Targums (Jerusalemi) corrobo- rates this tradition; for, among its preserved fragments, we find the last clause rendered thus: ~ly Tl100 9 'nf K~1 "that I may not see the evil of them who are thy people." If now this latter text (0 jf) be adopted as the more probable original form of f, then there would seem to be some justification for the conservative argument adduced by Leusden and quoted above (see page 235 commencing with "(3) Mihi verosimile videtur, etc.," through to the end of the extract); for there would then be no apparent reason which could lead the scribe to substitute another reading for the one already existing, as it would obviously be already the most natural mode of expressing the idea which the tenor of the context logic- ally demands, and that, too, without having any features which could possibly be conceived of as derogatory to the Deity. But if on the other hand, we take the former reading ( i) to be the correct recension, then there arises an inevit- able presumption, more or less conclusive, that the emendation did originate as charged, because of the cogency of the evident motive in the case. To which text the final preference ought to be given is a question to be decided solely by a pre- ponderance of evidence, based upon a thorough critical investigation, and such we cannot here enter upon. III. and IV. Num. xiI. 12. (f). "Let her not, I pray, be as the dead, through whose proceeding from the womb of our own mother (1~a), the half of our own flesh (3'l17) would thus be consumed. " (7). "Let her not, I pray, be as the dead born child, which when it comes out of its mother's (IO) womb, has half of its flesh (fI@)) consumed." Here it will be noticed are two Tikkun Sopherim, the causes for which are not very apparent. Possibly the motive might have been, that by f a reflection seemed somehow to be cast upon the mother of Moses. At any rate it seems difficult to conceive how anything stated in 3 could possibly, by the most fer- tile imagination, yea, even that of a Hebrew scribe, be considered as expressing or implying disrespect to Yahweh. V. 1 Sam. III. 13.</page><page sequence="7">TIKKUN SOPHERIM. 239 (n). "And I tell him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, for his sons cursed me (9 ), and he rebuked them not." ()). "And I tell him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, for his sons did bring a curse upon themselves (b"$), and he rebuked them not." The Septuagint renders this clause as follows :-birt KaKouoyo?vrEg ~bv of vioi ahroi which significantly corroborates f , if it does not, in fact, lend weight to the view that the original reading was 0'r" 8 (eFv) rather than , . But at all events, the idea is identically the same, as Buxtorf indicates when he says, ", mihi, scil. Deo."l The motive underlying the emendation in this case is obvious enough. It was too offensive to believe that the sons of Eli could openly blas- pheme God, and Eli be cognizant of it, and yet not reprimand them. The text, as it now stands, in j , confessedly presents many difficulties to a lucid interpretation; this fact conjoined with the above evidence strongly leads to the conclusion that it has undergone a corruption.2 VI. 2 Sam. xvI. 12. (f). "Perhaps Yahweh will behold with his eye ('37,fl), and Yahweh will requite me good instead of his cursing this day." (1). "Perhaps Yahweh will look on my eye (**), and will requite me good instead of his cursing this day." There is great doubt and uncertainty as to the correct reading in this verse, the Massorites, for once, being far less explicit than we could wish that they had been. The above recension has been adopted, as, on the whole, the more proba- ble one; though it must be confessed, not without considerable doubt as to its correctness. Perhaps we cannot more clearly show the confusion which rests on this matter, than by quoting from Buxtorfa, "Hunc locum Massora utroque loco adducit: recensetur quoque in libro Tanchuma, in Parascha Beschallach in Exo- do:4 sed in qua voce ")'n consistat, non explicant. Commentatores hic quoque nullius 1,n, meminerunt, cum alias R. Solomon et R. David loca ista adducere et explicare soleant.

The form .  found in f, undoubtedly might be open to the imputation of conveying anthropomorphic ideas of Yahweh, and hence would of course be objectionable to the scribes; but what should induce the alteration of 31f/l my 1 Lex.

VII. and VIII. 1 Kgs. xII. 16 and 2 Chron. x. 16. (3). And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king saying, "What portion have we in David ? nor have we an inheritance in the son of Jesse; [every man] to his God (1..), O Israel! now see to thine own house, David !" So [all] Irsael departed to their God (Jf). And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king saying, " What portion have we in David ? nor have we an inheritance in the son of Jesse: [every man] to thy tents ( *] "), O Israel! now see to thine own house David?" So [all] Israel departed to their tents (t',*'7K). Here the wording of 3 graphically brings out the idea that the rebellious separation of Israel from the house of David, was, in the mind of the writer, noth- ing less than a renunciation of Yahweh, and a direct transition to idolatry; but it is readily conceivable that the terms employed might be considered by devout scribes as altogether too vigorous language, and besides as intimating, not alone disrepect, but even open defiance of Yahweh, and the subsequent delay of merited punishment might by some be perversely construed as a circumstance going to show that Yahweh could be contemptuously treated with impunity. In fact f does not, in reality change the idea contained in , but only clothes it in a less objectionable dress, for Israel did forsake the sanctuary at Jerusalem for the worship of idolatry in tents at Bethel and Dan. IX. Jeremiah II. 11. (n). "Hath a nation changed its gods ? and yet they are no gods, but my people have changed my glory (Cty) for that which doth not profit (i. e. an idol)." (J"). "Hath a nation changed its gods ? and yet they are no gods, but my people have changed their glory (lfTj), for that which doth not profit."' Here the f, as we have seen in previous instances, does not alter the essen- tial thought in the least, but by a slight modification of one small letter , an offensive feature in 3 is removed. There can be do doubt but that "their glory" refers to the Lord; the context imperatively demands such an interpretation. Neumann, arguing in favor of this point, is constrained to say: "Daher konnte 1 Lange Schaff Comr., p. 509.</page><page sequence="9">TIKKUN SOPHERIM. 241 Petrus Galatinus meinen (De Arcanis Cath. Verit. I. c. 8, p. 30), es heisse urspriing- lich 91 "1' The correction in this case is of the same character as those in XI. and XV. and the motive underlying each is identical. X. Ezekiel viii. 17. (n). " Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man ? Is it a light matter to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they com- mit here ? for they have filled the land with violence and they constantly repeat to provoke me to anger, and, lo, they put the branch to my nose (t5K)." (0). The same, except the last clause which reads: "and, lo, they put the branch to their nose (N)." This passage perhaps requires no comment, and yet there is one view of it which we do not wish to overlook. The anthropomorphism in 2 is so pronounced, taken in connection with the immediate context, as to almost awaken repugnance in one, even though not a Jew, unfamiliar with this reading. How much greater then, the painful recoil which it would always have produced in the minds of devout Hebrews, had it been the received recension.2 But on a closer unprej- udiced inspection, much of its seemingly objectionable character disappears. The generally adopted interpretation put upon the word f')1t "branch," is that it is connected with some idolatrous practice of the Persians in their worship of the sun. Now if this be correct, what is more reasonable or appropriate than that the Lord, in enumerating the great abominations committed by the house of Israel, should culminate the recital by saying: And, lo, they flaunt the very insig. nia of their idolatry in my face, and thus we would obtain a most forcible exposi- tion of a passage otherwise very obscure, for certain it is, that the critics and commentators hitherto have not, on the basis of the textus receptus (" put the branch to their nose "), altogether satisfactorily explained this verse.3 XI. Hosea Iv. 7. (3) "The more they increased, the more did they sin against me: my glory they changed into shame (V1V"I l~i) i' )-)" (t!) " The more they increased, the more did they sin against me: I will change their glory into shame (10 , jl) 7}'123)." A full explication of the verbal changes implied in this Tikkun is wanting. In most of the authorities we find simply the most meagre statements. As an illus- tration of this, take Leusden's remark4 " b'I13 gloriam ipsorum pro ,711 glo- riam meam," which literally carried out would result in the unintelligible phrase : "My glory I will change into shame ;" for it is utterly incongruous with the con- text, and besides, has no relevancy or harmony with the explanations given by 1 Jeremias, vol. I., p. 200. Leipzig, 1854. 2 But as to the use of the expression 1 , elsewhere, by Yahweh, consult Isa. lxv. 5. s Cf. Lange-Schaif Commentary ad hoo looo. 4 Philol. Heb., vol.

It is too irrational a supposition to be entertained for a mo- ment, that the ancient scribes thus intended it to be understood. I have, there- fore, adopted in 3, the only consistent interpretation that has presented itself in the course of a somewhat careful investigation: it is, at least, in perfect accord with the analogous changes to be found in IX. and XV. The motive leading to the alteration in this case is self-apparent. It was offensive to think that wicked mortal man had the power to debase, in any degree, the glory of the infinite Yahweh. XII. Habakkuk I. 12. (n). "Art not thou from everlasting, O Yahweh, my God, my Holy One ? Thou diest not (cnlf' ). O Yahweh,thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction." (J). "Art not thou from everlasting, O Yahweh, my God, my Holy One ? We shall not die (tf )," etc., etc. It almost seems unnecessary to do more than simply quote Ewald upon this passage; he says, verse 12, " f0? and ,1 * , according to the sense of the passage, refer as plainly to the Chaldean himself, as fif' must be read instead of f*  , contrary to the Massora and LXX. in d I" answers to nfl Ni. The phrase which appeared objectionable-to a good many ancient readers, really expresses only our idea of immortality; but, we shall not die, or f)gg *I LXX. [ica' oi Jtr TlroO6vtEv] that we die not, is a thought which is quite foreign to the pas- sage. "1 In this opinion Bleek also concurs, for he says: "- from the context it is very probable, as Ewald also thinks, that ff s' is the genuine reading, which on account of the expression seeming offensive, they [the Sopherim] thought they ought to alter."2 This is, moreover, substantiated by the Targum, which thus paraphrases the clause in question: jt,y* D, *) , "Thy word endureth forever."' R. Sol. Isaaci (Rashi) also adopts this reading, quoting it as the original writing of the prophet. In this connection it is a significant fact worthy of note, that the Revised Version of 1884 has to this particular verse the marginal comment, "According to an ancient Jewish tradition, thou diest not." Undoubtedly to the ancient Scribes, it was considered unbefitting to speak of death at all in regard to Yahweh, even though, as in this case, the direct denial of the Lord's ever experiencing it, was predicated. XIII. Zechariah II. 12. (A. V. verse 8.) (n). For thus saith Yahweh of hosts, (for the sake of your glory hath he sent me unto the nations which despoil you), 'He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of my eye (t,,t3).'

"For thus saith Yahweh of hosts, for the sake of your glory hath he sent me unto the nations which despoil you, for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye (*t)." Here the Sopherim thought that they could detect a tendency toward anthro- pomorphism, similar to that displayed in X. The main objectionable element in both these passages, appears to have been, that the pronominal suffix employed (9 my) seemed to imply that Yahweh himself ascribed to himself certain degrading anthropomorphic characteristics. Moreover the Lord is never elsewhere repre- sented as himself using the personal pronoun my in conjunction with so pro- nounced an anthropomorphism as, "apple of the eye." Its use, therefore, in this exceptional case, might be construed as an inconsistency, and hence deroga- tory to the divine character. XIV. Malachi I. 13. (a). "And ye have said, Behold, what a bore it is. And ye have snuffed at me (tf), saith Yahweh of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus have ye brought the offering: should I accept this from you ? saith Yahweh." (n). "And ye have said, Behold, what a bore it is; and ye have snuffed at it (IfJi'), saith Yahweh of hosts," etc. Commenting on this verse, Keil and Delitzsch remark: "Jerome thinks that instead of f we might read tif, which is found in a good number of codices."l They, however, feel constrained, on general principles, to reject the reading, and stand upon the textus receptus. The exact words of Jerome, above referred to, are, " ut in Hebraeo legi potest, et exsuflastis me, haec dicendo, non sacrificio, sed, mihi cui sacrificabatis, fecistis injuriam." In support of this view, R. Sol. Isaaci is quoted by Buxtorf as saying: " In textu sacro fuisse scriptum nif et postea per Scribas correctum fiK ut hodie legitur."2 The expression as well as the idea contained in 3 has, it cannot but be admitted, a tendency to awaken a revulsion of feeling in a sensitive reverential heart. Therefore, if the emendation was made, the motive that actuated it was good. XV. Psalm cvI. 20. (3). " Thus they changed my glory ("ty))) into the similitude of an ox, that eateth herbage." (n). Thus they changed their glory (0S1) into the similitude of an ox that eateth herbage." The remarks under IX. will equally apply here, for the cases are almost iden- tical. As a circumstance tending to show that a certain degree of uncertainty as to the true text, has from remote time existed, we may cite the fact, that the Vulgate here reads, gloriam suam, which is supported by some codices of the 1 Commentary on the Minor Prophets, vol. II., p. 440. 2 Lex., Rad., l .</page><page sequence="12">244 HEBRAICA. LXX. where we find 66Fav ai&amp;tro ; both indicating a single suffix (f'11 ). Consult the striking parallel in Rom. I. 23. XVI. Job. vii. 20. (a). "If I have sinned, what injury can I cause unto thee, O thou Watcher of men ? Why hast thou set me up as a target for thee to strike at, and why have I become a burden unto thee ( 9 l )." (n). The same except the last word which here reads: "unto myself (9 y)." This is a case where the presumption raised, in favor of 3 being the original reading, is very strong. The Septuagint so has it, eipu d ew oi bopriov; and many of the ablest critics have given their decision in its favor. We have space but to mention only one or two of the numerous authorities which have endorsed it. The eminent Jewish Commentator Ibn Ezra (1092-1167) adopts it as the original form written by the author. Houbigant, in his Biblia Hebraica cum notis criticis, 1753, says: "Ngn~ ~ Y i  etc., sum mihi gravis. Imo if7 tibi, quod scribae mutarent in t. Id vocant correctionem scribarum, h. e. t*) li) , quod indignum divina majestate arbitrarentur ut homuncio Deo esset oneri. Sed num fuerunt sapientiores Deo ? Haec Drusius, ex ipso Aben-Ezra Judaeo, qui sic aiebat: correctio est scribarum licit expositio ejus absque correctione recta sit." Sapienter vero id Aben-Ezra, cum ly sui simile habeat in priori membro, et cum scriptum habuerint tbJY Graeci interpretes." And in our day, such an able and conservative critic as Dr. Delitzsch feels himself constrained to ac- cept this reading in preference to that of the Massora; he thus expresses his conviction: "Why, says Job, hast thou made me a mark of hostile attack, and why am I a burden to thee ? It is not so in our text; but according to Jewish tradition, (Y, which we now have, is only a 0tiy i)n correctio scribarum, for 9 Y, which was removed as bordering on blasphemy. This reading I should not consider as the original, in spite of the tradition, if it were not confirmed by the LXX."' In this he is followed by the Lange-Schaff Commentary. It does indeed seem as though it were only a matter of time before t)y would again obtain its due recognition and take its rightful place in the printed text. May we not with confidence assert that, when that much desired critically revised Hebrew Text shall appear, as appear it certainly must, this will be one of the corrections to be found incorporated in it. XVII. Job. xxxii. 3. (a). "And against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer to Job arid also because they had condemned divine justice (l,- F?)." (n). "And against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job ()}ty JK)." Tradition has preserved an alternative reading in ), viz., Ot)b 'K . 1 Commentary on the Book of Job, translated by Bolton, 2d ed. 1886.</page><page sequence="13">TIKKUN SOPHERIM. 245 "God :" if this be adopted, the clause of course would be: "And also because they had condemned God." It is not indicated which is the more probably true reading. At any rate, the idea is evidently precisely the same, whichever term be employed. Hitzig, though not giving his support to the traditional view (i. e., that the scribes have here made an emendation), still suggests that the reading itl ) may be the foundation for the rendering found in the LXX., tlbrt oib Ijvvy O'Oav roixptel8vat avriilra 'I3, Kca' WCvro aiirbv Eivat h eeP3.1 The reasonableness of the state- ment found in , as viewed in the light of other expressions met with in the poem, has been seriously attacked by some: e. g., Dr. Delitzsch peremptorily dis- misses it with the remark, "According to the Jewish view, fIK- I~'t **') is one of the eighteen '0131 + (correctiones scribarum), since it should be o'ety -rK tY'pS` . But it is not the friends who have been guilty of this sin of Y'~t7~* against God, but Job, ch. xL. 8, to whom Elihu opposes the sen- tence V,1*t - p , ch. xxxIv. 12. Our judgment of another such tikcun, ch. viI. 20, was more favorable."2 This objection seems to us to be without solid foundation, and rests upon a strange misconception and failure to apprehend the true trend of the various arguments, nor is it sustained by the passages referred to as authorities when they are rightly construed; for ch. xxxIv. 12 is obviously addressed to the three friends, and not to Job, as it is most commonly interpreted; this is plainly indi- cated by the form of address employed in verses 2 and 10. This whole passage, as we take it, is a fervid discourse addressed to the three friends for the purpose of instructing them as to how they could and should have effectively answered Job, which they had undoubtedly in their arguments failed to do, and for which palpable failure Elihu's anger was excited against them. And ch. xL. 8 does by no means preclude the idea that the three friends were guilty of condemning divine justice in their arguments, as is shown by the words employed by the Lord in the epilogue, where he explicitly censures them for not having spoken of me the thing that is right (ch. xLII. 7, 8). Now the statement here made manifestly pre- sents an incongruity when considered in the light of the common interpretation as founded upon the reading )~*t . in ch. xxxnI. 3, to obviate which the translators of the LXX. here have made clearly an intentional correction and thereby bring into harmony these discordant statements (i. e., ch. xnII. 8, o yiap {a2fYarTe a2l?6&amp; Kar Tro OEpiwovrO6~ /ov '"16); and what is quite remarkable, some MSS. of the Hebrew exhibit a like reading (i. e., *t * t'"3 against my servant Job);-all of which certainly tend to demonstrate the reasonableness of the reading found in . 1 ' Das Buch Hiob," 1874, Note b, page 240. 2 "Commentary on the Book of Job," Bolton's translation, 2d ed., 1863.</page><page sequence="14">246 HEBRAICA. Dr. Green has, with rare insight, detected and exposed the necessary logical result to which the argument of the three friends leads, when he says, "The friends undertook to justify God's providential dealings. The failure of their argument apparently leaves the divine proceedings open to censure and without any adequate vindication . . . They had really inculpated the providence of God by their professed defense of it. By disingenuously covering up and ignoring its enigmas and seeming contradictions they had cast more discredit upon it than Job by honestly holding them up to the light. Their denial of its apparent ine- qualities was more untrue and more dishonoring to the divine administration, as it is in fact conducted, than Job's bold affirmation of them. Even his most start- ling utterances, wrung from him in his bewilderment and sore perplexity, were less reprehensible than their false statements and false inferences."1 Viewed in this light, is it in anywise strange or unreasonable that the inspired writer should predicate of "the messenger of God, who came to plead God's cause," for such Elihu undoubtedly was, that "against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer to Job, and also because they had condemned divine justice" ? Moreover, if a Tikkun Sopherim is anything at all, it is one of two things: (1) a record of what the author actually wrote in a particular case; or, (2) a notice indicating what the ancient scribes considered the sense of the context naturally and logically demanded. If the former be true, then verily these critics have become wiser than the spirit of inspiration. And if the latter be true, then they certainly convict the Hebrew scribes of an egregious misunderstanding of an argument expressed in their own language, and what is more, contained in their so carefully studied Sacred Scriptures; which is indeed as improbable as that Dr. Delitzsch has discovered the only construction which can be put upon ch. xL. 8. It hardly needs mention, that the reason which might have influenced a scribe to consider a correction desirable, was the offensiveness of a statement implying that mortal man had audaciously condemned the infinitely wise and just God. XVIII. Lamentations II. 19-21. (n). "O remember my wretched and forlorn condition, it is wormwood and gall. Yea, verily thou wilt remember, and thy soul will condescend unto me (  '~Y ty ): this I recall to my heart, therefore have I hope." (p)). " O remember my wretched and forlorn condition, it is wormwood and gall. My soul indeed remembers, and is humiliated within me (tY) pyggy 'y'j); this I recall to my heart, therefore have I hope." If, in this case ri be a correct translation of the Massoretic text, and such it most probably is, then there is even to the English reader, evidently a marked lack of cohesion between the clauses, and a painful want of logical concatenation 1 "The Argument of the Book of Job unfolded," pages 245 and 519.</page><page sequence="15">TIKKUN SOPHERIM. 247 in the thought; while, on the other hand, the clearness and beauty of the idea brought out in ) cannot but awaken an involuntary sanction and approval in the mind of every candid reader. If it be a fact that an emandation has been incor- porated into the text here, then, indeed, it is to be regretted; for great has been the loss sustained, through the over-zealousness of Hebrew scribes in removing a seeming offensive anthropomorphism, which resulted well nigh in an annihila- tion of the sense. But if this view seem to lack support, then by far the most reverential attitude to assume is, that the text, as we now possess it, has suffered corruption during the process of time. Such indeed, is the view entertained by eminent commentators, who have been prolific in suggesting various emanda- tions. But, after all, what is more reasonable or natural than to adopt the sug- gestion supported by the oldest tradition, and which so beautifully and consist- ently removes all ambiguity. In conclusion, we feel confident that we cannot do better than quote the judgments expressed upon the Tikkum Sopherimn by two such eminent authorities as Eichhorn and Bleek. The former concludes from "the character of the readings " that "this'recension took note only of certain errors which had crept into the text through transcribers, and which were corrected by collection of MSS.1 The latter thus expresses himself : " It is usually assumed that the notes called likkun Sopherim were merely alterations of incorrect readings in many manuscripts, according to others which were more exact, and it is supposed, un- questionably, that the readings brought forward by the Sopherim, which are just those of our present MSS. and editions, were the genuine and original ones. But in what we find stated, there is nothing to the effect that they were emendations from other MSS.; thus, then, the question would arise how the readings set aside by the corrections of the Sopherim were introduced into MSS.; as from the nature of many of the readings, they could not have got in by mere accident. Partly from the statements of the Massorites, and partly from the nature of many of the readings set aside by the Ti]kkun Sopherim as compared with those introduced by the latter and now existing in the text, we are led to look upon the matter in the following way :-that in these passages there actually existed generally, or at least in most of the manuscripts in use, other readings which, because in some points of view they presented certain offensive or doubtful expressions, the So- pherim considered themselves justified in altering. Thus, in a critical point of view, these earlier readings which are specified as being altered, always deserve much attention, and at least in many cases, it may be really assumed with great probability that they are the original ones. It may, however, be assumed with probability, that these correctiones scribarum existed in ancient times, indeed before the date of the Talmud, and that it is only by accident that they are not 1 Einleitung in das Alten Test., 1823, ? 116.</page><page sequence="16">248 HEBRAICA. expressly mentioned in the latter. But the fact that the knowledge of them was afterwards preserved serves as a direct proof of the anxiety that was shown as to the form of the text."1 Our main purpose in the writing of this article has been (1) to attempt to demonstrate the fact that there was a cogent motive in each case, sufficient to induce the Sopherim to change the original text; and (2) to establish, by external as well as internal proof, the basis for the presumption that the original text has actually suffered corruption at the hands of the ancient scribes, if not in all, at least in some of the cases considered, whether we have succeeded in our ob- ject, or not, is a question to be decided by the verdict of each unprejudiced reader. If it be proven that the scribes have, in truth, made one single correction in the original writings in the places designated as Tikkun Sopherim, then their whole line of defense must fall to the ground; for it is no longer entitled to the least credence, and the value of each Tikkun must be determined solely by the weight of evidence in its favor, in each individual case, totally irrespective of any statements or explanations handed down by personally interested scribes. Falsus in uno falsus in omnibus is a well established principal of legal evidence for determining the credibility of witnesses, and it is equally applicable to the case in hand. In closing, we have only to say that there has been, throughout this discus- sion, an honest intention to bring to light only the truth, and while so doing, to endeavor to be fair and just in the criticisms indulged in and the judgments expressed. 1 Introduction to the O.
