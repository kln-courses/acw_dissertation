A recent article by Marvin Trachtenberg on the current state of architectural history ("Some Observations on Recent Architectural His- tory," The Art Bulletin, June 1988), which calls attention to the inherent problems and dif- ficulties of book reviews, is particularly ap- propriate to Suzanne Blier's remarkable study of the architecture of the Batammaliba in northern Benin and Togo. The descriptive detail is so intimately woven into the complex- ity and richness of interpretation that nuances of thought and vitality of expression can only suffer in the "desiccation" normally required of a book review. Further, and more rele- vantly, Trachtenberg points out that "most re- viewers have a hidden agenda, whether in the way of ideological contention or personal rivalry, almost always masked under a facade of objectivity and magnanimous impartiality." When a book coincides with the reviewer's own field of interest or scholarly domain, it will receive either a glowing account or be roundly condemned; it will be welcomed as an innovative addition to a field that has long been neglected or as a vehicle to argue one's own ideological stance, preferred methodol- ogy, or interpretation. All of the above I have tried to both acknowledge and avoid in the comments that follow. In contrast to the objec- tive experience and material existence that my own pragmatic training has tended to em- phasize, Blier's main theme is ontology and metaphor in architecture: metaphysics. Perhaps that is why I must also admit to such difficulty in reading, and rereading, the book. 16</page><page sequence="2">ART IMAGES N.Y.C. Ibo terracotta H.34 cm.

"It is a study of the meanings that Batammaliba architects and occupants bring to their build- ings." This is the basis on which she elabo- rates, in overwhelming and sometimes repeti- tive detail, not the construction process or its rationale, but the workings of the Batam- maliba mind and social order. The book is a remarkable account of meaning in Batam- maliba culture. Architecture is used as the medium through which the culture is de- scribed; it is the object of the sentence, not its noun or subject. This basic premise dearly emerges in the in- troduction, where Blier suggests that architec- ture's ultimate basis lies in the intellectual ideas of a period and place, that its signifi- cance is grounded in the experiences and in- tellectual explanations of its makers and users, that issues of ontological and metaphorical expression are central to it, and that ontology, rooted in the reality of human existence, is contextualized in concrete experiences. Blier also notes that it is essential to examine ar- chitecture in process and to study its occu- pants. It is in their use of architecture and the symbols they identify with it that a building can be understood in its most complete sense. The book accordingly focuses on both occupants and creators. For me, the most easily comprehended chapters were the introduction and the con- cluding summary The opening concise but exceedingly sparse descriptions of the house form and its architectural elements served as the points of departure for the subsequent complex theoretical chapters. These latter are best understood in retrospect, after reading the summary The organization of the con- tents implies a pragmatic approach, but that is belied by the book's substance. While Blier notes in the introduction that African architec- ture (like all architecture) represents a text or a language system whose meaning can be un- derstood through its orientation, form, mate- rials, construction process, and details (i.e., concrete experiences), these questions are outside the realm of her focus. Further on in her introduction, the author acknowledges that although Batammaliba culture has been isolated by virtue of its set- ting, it by no means has been insulated from outside influence. By emphasizing the strong persistence of the traditional architectures (and the perpetuation of traditional cultural values), however, she sets the stage for a syn- chronic analysis that de-emphasizes and barely acknowledges the process of change, either in Batammaliba culture or its architec- ture. The focus of her study is thus primarily a description, albeit superbly rendered. In her introduction, Blier also addresses the related question of architectural specialization and, by implication, individual creativity. Yet, what does this imply when there are 25 architects of varying experience in a community of 450 people and 61 houses? Do they all practice their metier during each dry season? Al- though conformity to traditional standards of architectural form and technique is posed 18</page><page sequence="3">Philippe Guimiot Expert 138 Av.

A specific point in question: if the ritual building of two earthen shrines at the entrance to a Batammaliba house represents in one case the architect's deceased elder and in the other the house owner's deceased elder, what happens when architect and owner are one and the same, as so much of her data suggests? Is the architect (i.e., the creator) so much a part of the collective mentality that meaning only un- folds in the process of creativity itself, or does the built form acquire collective meaning in the course of its use? Is Batammaliba society as homogeneous and homeostatic as the study implies? Blier describes the rituals involved in house construction: those surrounding the laying of the foundation, the incorporation of the entry doorsill, the building of the male wall, the building of the house terrace with its con- comitant lighting of the family fire, the con- struction of the two earthen shrines on the south (male) side of the portal, and finally, the completion of the ten-level wall that defines the top of the sleeping room. The description is intriguing, since these are the key elements that define architectural space and structure. Yet, the concept of space or the technology of structure that defines it is never directly ad- dressed. The definition, the designation, and the enclosure of space, whether conceptually or in the built reality, constitute for the ar- chitect in the Western world (and I believe the non-Western world as well) the point of de- parture for any architectural theory or prac- tice. Having carefully and with much sympathy followed the points made in the introduction, I discovered, pragmatist that I am, that the best way to read this book was to then turn to the concluding chapter on building ontology, metaphor, and multiplexity, for that is where the aims of the book are most clearly and suc- cinctly articulated and where the issues bear- ing on the relationship between ontology and metaphor in architectural expression are most sharply defined. These issues, as I under- stand them, and as they are enumerated chapter by chapter, are 1) to establish a rela- tionship between cosmogony and building design, meaning, and ritual; 2) to trace per- ceived change from the ideal (the delineation of primordial architectural creation through the analysis of verbal accounts of the myths of origin) to the present, by exploring current building traditions; 3) to examine the signs of architecture and the language they convey by means of "path metaphors," which provide concrete expression of the ontology of reli- gious belief; 4) to consider the nature of an- thropomorphism and anthropomorphic im- agery in Batammaliba architecture; 5) to estab- lish the complementarity of house, family, and tomb as expressed in the architecture; 6) to examine the relationship between power and architecture; and 7) to consider the dramaturgical role of each building - the transformation of house into theater. The metaphysical anatomy on which the entirety of architectural explanation and in- terpretation hangs clearly emerges in a chap- ter on cosmogony, where a diversity of visual metaphors used by the Batammaliba in the transposition of their ideas about the cosmos into architectural and ritual form is suggested. Blier elaborates on "nesting," "directional af- filiation," "silhouetting," "skeuomorphs," "synechdoches," "reversal," and "con- densed" metaphors (e.g., the use of the house itself to represent a miniaturized imago mundi). Then she translates these categories of metaphor into more concrete metaphors: physical representations such as plants, eggs, carvings, and modeled clay. The categories of metaphor "bridge the conceptual chasm be- tween the highly abstract and remote realm of the larger cosmos and the practical, lived ex- perience of the real world" (p. 57). In a second chapter on architectural ar- chetypes, the metaphysical basis for explana- tion emerges even more clearly. Blier's model for the interpretation of architectural change in Batammaliba village planning and house form is patterned on Joseph Rykwert's theoretical paradigm of primordial architec- tural prototypes for the definition of building form and symbolism. Mythical descriptions 20</page><page sequence="4">of Linaba, the first Batammaliba village, rec- orded from her informants, serve as the pro- totype against which the reality of contempo- rary architectural form and practice is com- pared and explained. And yet, using these descriptions of the mythological past, fas- cinating as they are, as explanation for the present, measurable configuration of architec- tural forms is quite the reverse of using such accounts to explain how the present is legitimized by reference to the past. Blier's suggestion that "the memory of Linaba paradise has been maintained in contempo- rary architectural practice" and that Batam- maliba "houses, shrines, and village organiza- tion remain monuments to an idyllic past" in- volves a set of premises that appear to be con- trary to my pragmatic logic. Accepting ver- batim a mythic description of the concep- tualized past as the reality of an urarchitektur precludes the study of the historic reality of process and change. Rykwert's other study on The Origin of the Town might have served as a more appropriate paradigm by which to bridge the gap between the real and the ideal. The anthropomorphic house-body sym- bolism so poignantly and persuasively pre- sented by the author in a chapter on architec- tural self-images is extended to a higher, so- cial, level in a subsequent chapter on the power of architecture. For the Batammaliba, "power and polity are distinctively an- thropocentric: the dominant metaphor is the human." Power, in turn, is characterized by four features or values: a commitment to gerontocratic authority, a concern for the rights and privileges of the earliest residents in the community, a valuation of general egalitarianism, and an emphasis on indi- vidual power and accumulation of wealth. The most relevant, and for me most interest- ing, part of this discussion lies in the para- graphs that address the tensions between the ideal of egalitarianism and the realities of in- equality, and between community values and individual power; herein lies the beginning of a dialectic approach that might be more re- vealing in terms of not only social change but architectural change as well. I cannot help but wonder if concepts concerning power are not inherently predicated, the world over, on humanity and conflict. In addition to the very welcome summary that opens the final chapter on architectural exegesis, there is a further discussion of pri- mary metaphors, from "the simple ball of earth to more complex concepts associated with positioning and direction." Among these are the human body, the path, the house itself. And, if I understand correctly, the as- pect of order and antipathy conveyed by metaphor and ontology is also reflected in the diverse categories used to define other as- pects of knowledge and experience. Four primary shapes are represented among the many categories found in Batammaliba ar- chitecture: the circle, the line, the fork, and the cross. These four shapes, the author claims, serve to "clarify the critical interrela- tionship between metaphor and ontology in architectural expression and meaning."

Additionally, she considers categories of number and color that "play a critical role in architectural meaning and identity" in the light of positive and negative cultural values. The chapter ends with what appears to me to be the most intriguing, controversial, and yet potentially most promising discussion: the language of building. It is in these last pages that one might find the key to achieving the goals set forth in the first pages. Semantic analysis also invites a perspective in which ar- chitecture could be the noun, and to the pragmatic reader it suggests that the way ar- chitects and builders approach the job in hand might equally serve as a model for what we seek to understand about architecture: why things were and are built and used. The quo- tation by Vitruvius that introduces the book would then take on more relevance, since the tenets and canons he so lucidly advocated were derivative of an architectural engineer- ing practice used in the service of the Roman Empire under Augustus. While I may personally take issue with the author's ideological stance, with the way she has ordered and interpreted the incomparably rich data, with her synchronic and static ap- proach to culture, and with her view of ar- chitecture as object rather than subject, the greatest value of the book, for me, lies in the many new avenues it opens up for investiga- tion and thought. One cannot deny that Blier's volume carries the study of African archi- tecture to a qualitatively new level of scholarship. It introduces a new dimension whereby the architectural medium can be used to illuminate much of the entire belief system of any culture.
