<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EXCAVATIONS AND SURVEYS Tel Hazor, 1997* The eighth season of excavations of the 'Selz Foundation Hazor Excavations in Memory of Yigael Yadin' took place between 24 June and 5 August 1997. The excavations, sponsored by the Israel Exploration Society and the Selz Foundation, in cooperation with the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, are a joint project of the Philip and Muriel Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Complutense University in Madrid. The project also receives financial support from the Rothschild (Yad Hanadiv) Foundation and from Edith and Henry Everett, N.Y. The excavations are carried out within the Hazor National Park, and benefit from the full cooperation of the National Parks Authority. The 130 participants in the 1997 season included groups from Complutense University, Madrid (directed by Maria-Teresa Rubiato), the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary of North Carolina (directed by Steven Andrews), the Northwestern Baptist College of British Columbia (directed by Phil Schafran), and the Indiana Wesley an University (directed by Wilbur Williams), a group of volunteers from Germany (directed by Winifred H?rst) and a group of archaeology students from the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Volunteers from the U.S., Australia and several countries in Europe also participated. The 'Selz Foundation Hazor Excavations in Memory of Yigael Yadin' are directed by Amnon Ben-Tor of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The Hazor expedition also included A. Zarzecki-Peleg (field archaeologist) and area supervisors: D. Ben-Ami, S. Cohen, D. Sandhouse and B. Villegas (Area A); and M. Cimadevilla and S. Zuckerman (Area * Cf. IEJ 46 (1996), pp. 262-268. M). Assistant area supervisors were: S. Andrews, C. Melero, S. Moran, C. Rubio and D. Zigler (Area A); and P. Cinquini and A. Prats (Area M). The excavation surveyors were: R. Bonfii, I. Strand and M.-T. Rubiato. S. Becker, M. Shalvin and I. Shmila were responsible for recording the finds. S. Yedid, aided by I. Paritzki, was the expedition's administrator. The Excavations As in previous seasons, work focused on two areas, Area A in the centre of the site and Area M on its northern slope (Fig. 1).

Most of those uncovered in the 1997 season date from the eleventh-ninth centuries B.C.E. In the north-western section of Area A, a well stratified sequence of rooms belonging to buildings of the Israelite period was encountered, all cutting into the debris of the Canaanite palace. These rooms were associated with a rich ceramic assemblage, dating the buildings to the ninth-eighth centuries B.C.E. A large number of circular pits, large and small, was also unearthed, similar to those encountered by the Yadin expedition in the 1950s and by us in previous seasons.1 These pits, dating from the Iron Age I, are concentrated mainly in the large courtyard extending to the east of the palace. Their exact date and function have yet to be determined. The main focus in Area A was on expanding the excavation of the Canaanite palace westwards and of the courtyard to the east and north. By the end of the season the excavation of the large hall (the 'throne room') had been completed. The entire hall is paved with medium-sized pebbles, upon which the (wooden?2) floor was laid. The ceiling must have been supported by wooden pillars, which perished in the final conflagration; the location of at least one of these pillars, in the centre of the hall, is clearly visible. Two doorways in the southern wall of the 'throne room' lead into two rooms, to be excavated next season. These are located exactly opposite the two rooms north of the 'throne room', excavated in 1996, which were exceptionally rich in finds. A small, narrow room, located immediately behind the 'throne room', contained an installation, most probably a bathtub, and a rich ceramic assemblage. The western part of the palace was severely damaged by later Israelite building activities, leaving only the foundations of the palace's western wall. These are lined by well-cut orthostats, identical to those lining the northern wall of the palace. The northern, eastern and western walls of the palace having thus been determined, the southern portion of the palace is to be excavated in the coming 1998 season. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) tests conducted during the 1997 season clearly indicated the presence of massive walls, probably also lined with orthostats, located immediately to the north of the palace. This may prove to be a northern annex to 1 See IEJ 45 (1995), pp. 65, 283; IEJ 46 (1996), pp. 262-269. 2 /?/46(1996),p. 264.</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS 263 the palace, the excavation of which is also planned for 1998. Uncovering of the huge courtyard extending east of the palace continued, and an area of 30 30 m., paved by pebbles and plaster, was cleared. In the centre of the courtyard, a raised rectangular podium of either civic or cultic function was encountered, located exactly opposite the palace entrance. Thus far, only the western and northern boundaries of this courtyard are known. The courtyard and palace are built on a rather steep slope. This made it necessary to build solid walls supporting fills in order to create a platform on which the entire palace complex was to be constructed. The juncture of massive walls exposed by the Yadin expedition in the 1950s3 is the north eastern corner of this platform. Evidence of the violent destruction of the palace was encountered, as in previous years, throughout the palace and courtyard. Among the fallen stones, bricks and ashes, an impressive variety of finds was encountered, including pottery, cylinder seals, metal artefacts and ivories, as well as part of a stone statue of an Egyptian king. The latter, like similar statues found in previous seasons, had suffered intentional mutilation in antiquity. Despite the rich Late Bronze ceramic assemblage recovered so far, further study will be required before a precise date for Hazor's final destruction within that period can be determined. The scarcity of imported ware in the Hazor assemblage ? Cypriote as well as Mycenaean ? is noteworthy. A life-size lion orthostat (Fig. 2), carved in relief on a smoothed basalt slab, was found while dismantling an eighth-century B.C.E. building, in the foundations of which it had been incorporated. It most probably was the left member of a pair which had guarded the entrance to a temple or palace of the Canaanite period. An identical lion orthostat, the right member of such a pair, was discovered by the Yadin expedition in the 1950s, buried next to the entrance of a temple located c. 1 km. to the north, in the lower city. Is this the missing member of the temple pair? Another large fragment of a lion orthostat, in secondary use as a door jamb of an Israelite building, was also uncovered during the season. The head of this lion had been uncovered by the Yadin expedition in the 1950s, a few metres away. Thus, this lion may also have been one of a pair, originally positioned somewhere in the Canaanite palace. Area M Excavations in this area were extended to the north and west. In the northern section, a large Israelite building (eighth century B.C.E.) was exposed, supporting the observation made in previous seasons that there was rather extensive Iron Age occupation outside the city walls ? which may have stood in ruins at the time. These later buildings of the Israelite period, and particularly the one just noted, caused severe damage to the remnants of the Canaanite period, located immediately below. Only meagre remains of a staircase located in this area were encountered. This staircase is somewhat later than the huge one partially cleared in previous seasons. These staircases most probably connected the upper and lower parts of the Canaanite city.4 The excavation of the Canaanite (cultic?) podium complex was expanded further west and north. Of major importance is the large gate leading to the paved area surrounding the 3 Y.

The presence of such a gate in this location has been conjectured since excavations in Area M began in the early 1990s. As in previous seasons, the Hazor expedition devoted a considerable effort to the conservation and preservation of the major architectural assemblages uncovered. Most of the work this year focused on the conservation of the orthostats and mudbricks of which the palace was built. New mudbricks were constructed, employing the original materials of which the ancient mudbricks were made and using, as much as possible, the same manufacturing techniques. The new bricks were incorporated into several of the gaps in the palace walls. After exposure for an entire year to the elements, the stability and state of preservation of these new bricks will be examined. These data will become crucial once large-scale conservation work at the site has been initiated. An olive-oil press, which originally stood in an eighth-century B.C.E. dwelling, was also restored. All this work was carried out under the supervision of O. Cohen, the expedition conservator.

The Sepphoris Regional Project is sponsored by Duke University and is affiliated with the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem. Additional support for the 1996 season was provided by the University of Connecticut, Converse College (SC), LaVerne University and Wake Forest University. The Excavations (Fig. 1) The 1996 season focused mainly on resolving issues raised by earlier excavation seasons. In 1993 and 1994, several rooms of a large Hellenistic building (Unit I) along the easternmost edge of the Residential Quarter had been uncovered. The 1996 excavations extended exploration of this building along its eastern, southern and northern sides. A portion of a north-south wall of a previously known room was uncovered on the south, along with several smaller walls of uncertain relationship to the Hellenistic building. On the north, instead of the closing wall that had been expected, a sequence of beautifully plastered miqva'ot was recovered, the latest (85.3226) nearly 4 m. wide and featuring a series of well-constructed plastered stairs leading down into a deep pool (Fig. 2). Ceramic and numismatic evidence from the bottom of the pool suggest that the installation went out of use in the first century CE. It had been built over another pool, oval in shape, that probably dates from the first century B.C.E. The superstructure(s) that would have enclosed either of these installations would have been constructed after the Hellenistic building had gone out of use, using parts of the structure in its foundations or basement where the miqva'ot were located. No trace of these superstructures has survived. At the south-eastern edge of Unit I we discovered a complex sequence of buildings, which utilised pre-existing structures. The best preserved phase dates from the Late Roman period, c. mid-fourth century CE. Several large pieces of elaborately moulded and painted plaster were among the finds associated with this structure, of which only a corner was excavated. Several earlier walls, dated to the first century CE. by the ceramic evidence, were found first outside this structure. The entire sequence was covered by a building of the Byzantine period. A wall (85.3196), several courses high, built entirely of re-used blocks of the Herodian period, has survived. We continued investigating the first century CE. building (Unit II) along the south-eastern edge of the Residential Quarter. Directly beneath fragmentary remains of a Byzantine structure, we found living spaces from the later part of the Early Roman period, which showed evidence of extensive alterations. A walkway or alleyway extending between the terraced fill above the Hellenistic building and the exterior wall of the first-century domicile had been closed off and additional surfaces laid down; the reasons for this activity are not entirely clear. Bedrock just outside the southern extent of this architectural unit showed signs of the extensive quarrying of the area that had taken place over a protracted period. Among the more interesting artefacts recovered in the fill over bedrock is a bronze buckle or amulet bearing the raised relief of a cherub on a goat in front of a fire altar (Fig. 3; see E. Reeder: Relief Plaque with Figurai Scenes, in R.M. Nagy et al. [eds.]: Sepphoris in Galilee: Crosscurrents of Culture [North Carolina Museum of Art No. 21], Raleigh, NC, 1996, p. 174).

Quarter, a series of trenches enabled the team to trace the line of a large drain (84.5074), or water channel, partially cut into bedrock. It was probably constructed under the main Roman-period roadway leading along the southern edge of the domestic area to a point where it would have connected with a road leading to the lower city cardo. An extremely large plastered pool (84.6015) was discovered on the north-western side of the water channel. Excavations to a depth of 9 m. still did not reach the bottom of the installation, which widens as it deepens. Extrapolating from the existing information, it can be estimated that the pool's capacity was in excess of 5,000 gallons, making it by far the largest such installation uncovered in the Residential Quarter so far. Most of the debris filling the pool had accumulated or had been thrown in by the mid-fourth century CE. Further to the west, several smaller installations were discovered, dating Fig. 3.

Several probes were made into previously excavated areas in order to check hypotheses about the overall organisation of space in the Residential Quarter. The results of these probes support the conclusion that a series of paved surfaces arranged in a linear pattern originally formed one continuous street, 5-6 m. in width. This street provided a distinct division of the domestic area into two blocks, c. 15 30 m. each, with each block sub-divided into four roughly equal domestic structures. Communicated by Eric M. Meyers, Carol L. Meyers and Kenneth G. Hoglund Tell 'En $ippori, 1996* The Sepphoris Regional Project has conducted three seasons of excavation at Tell ?ippori (grid ref. 1761 2374), which is located about 3 km. south of Roman Sepphoris and 5 km. west of Nazareth. The third excavation season took place between 28 May and 26 June 1996. The Sepphoris Regional Project is directed by E.M. Meyers and C.L. Meyers (Duke University, Durham, NC) and K.G. Hoglund (Wake Forest University, Winston Salem, NC). J.P. Dessel is the field director at Tel $ippori. Area supervisors in 1996: J. Jorgensen, S. Kielt and A. Creekmore. L. Bute served as architect; J. Alley was the registrar. The Sepphoris Regional Project is sponsored by Duke University and is affiliated with the W.F.

Additional support for the 1996 season came from Converse College (SC), LaVerne University (CA), the University of Connecticut and Wake Forest University. The Excavations (Fig. 1) Field I. Excavations in this field continued to focus on Building A, a large public structure * Cf. IEJA5 (1995), pp. 288-292. first uncovered in 1993. This Stratum III structure is dated to the late eleventh/early tenth centuries B.C.E. It measures at least 13 12 m. and is oriented north-east/south west; its northern and western limits have not yet been determined. Building A consists of a large open room (at least 11x7 m.) with a stone bench along one side and with three interior rooms and a narrow corridor behind the bench room. Excavation continued in the northern half of Area 1.3, where the entire beaten earth surface (1.3029) of the bench room was exposed. In the south-east corner of the bench room, a narrow triangular room was added in a second construction phase (Fig. 2). Two large flat stones in the triangular room appear to have been used as a seat and work surface. In the north-west corner of 1.3, also in the bench room, part of an installation (1.3055) was uncovered. This installation, a low square mudbrick platform at least 3 sq.m. in area, is lined with cobbles; some poorly preserved traces of plaster were found on top of it. Directly west of Area 1.3, Area 1.4 was re-opened in 1996 in order to locate the western extent of Building A. Three interior walls (1.4006, 1.4007 and 1.3024) were found to abut Building A's posterior wall (1.4017/1.1029), creating a non-symmetrical tripartite division to the rectangular area behind the bench room. The destruction debris ? which was found throughout the four areas of Field I ? is heaviest in Area 1.4. There was very little remaining material culture in the debris, and it appears that Building A was deliberately emptied prior to its destruction. It is clear that the south-western wall of Building A continues to the west, suggesting that the structure extends even further to the west than was previously believed. Field II.

A large pithos fragment on the surface points to a Middle Bronze II/III date. This earliest in situ material as yet found at ?ippori represents Stratum VII. In the northern half of Area ILI, deep mixed-debris layers were removed in order to expose Stratum VI (Late Bronze Age I). At least four rooms were found, oriented to the cardinal directions. In all four rooms there were well preserved beaten-earth surfaces, on which over a dozen restorable vessels lay. The most interesting feature is north south wall 11.1097, which extends 6 m. from the north baulk. This wall is constructed of small boulders built on a foundation of cyclopean stones. A storage jar and basalt pestle were found in a niche on the eastern face of this wall's southern end. Later Stratum V (Late Bronze Age II) walls disturbed and robbed out wall II. 1097, south of the niche. To its east there is a thick layer of destruction debris above a partially plastered surface (ILI 116). A concentration of small storage jars and basalt pestles was found on this surface, along with several pieces of worked pumice, a faience bead and a bronze spear point. Three rooms, the northern two of which were excavated, were identified in the western half of the area. A large group of restorable vessels was found in one of the rooms, along with fragments of imported pottery, including LB I Bichrome Ware, Chocolate-on-White Ware, Cypriote White Slip I and Cypriote Grey-Burnished Bottles. Stratum V was badly disturbed by pitting and by Stratum III construction activities. A pit (II. 1117) cut into the Stratum VI surface accounts for the intrusion of a significant quantity of Late Bronze Age II material into Stratum VI debris layers. Part of Stratum VI wall 11.1097 was rebuilt in Stratum V, and a poorly preserved beaten-earth surface ran up to the western face. An enigmatic stone cobble installation (IL 1102) ? a short, rectangular mound of cobbles, into which sherds were embedded ? was found on this surface. Stratum IV (Iron Age I) is also very poorly represented in the northern half of this area. Pit 11.1108, in the north-west corner of the area, accounted for the intrusion of Iron Age I sherds into Stratum V fills and debris layers. The most significant small find of the season, an almost complete lead figurine of a nude female (Fig. 3), was found in a layer of mixed debris (11.1076), although most of the pottery is Late Bronze Age II Fig. 3. Tell ?ippori: LB II lead figurine of nude female holding her breasts, found in Area ILL</page><page sequence="11">NOTES AND NEWS 271 in date. The tiny (6.5 cm. high) flat-cast object is probably a votive figurine (see C.L. Meyers: Figurine of a Nude Female, in R.M. Nagy et al. [eds.]: Sepphoris in Galilee: Crosscurrents of Culture [North Carolina Museum of Art No. 1], Raleigh, NC, 1996, pp. 151-155). Excavations in Area 11.2 consisted mainly of dismantling Stratum III (mid-tenth century) architecture. The stratigraphy here is very complex. Most of Stratum III was apparently constructed directly above Stratum V (Late Bronze Age II) remains. The Stratum III builders scraped down and removed extant Stratum IV (Iron I) features before building over Stratum V. However, one Stratum IV surface and some debris layers with Stratum IV materials were recovered. The sole surviving Stratum IV surface (11.2069) appears to have been made by scraping down mudbrick detritus. Several very crude hearths or bins were set into this surface, which was heavily burned and covered with a layer of ash. Because it clearly covers Stratum V wall 11.2097, the large Stratum V/IV building (c. 13.2 m. long) was probably no longer in use in the later part of the Iron Age I. Stratum III cobbled surface 11.2022 was found abutting the corner of Stratum V walls 11.2012 and 11.2097. This juxtaposition may be explained by the presence of the Stratum V (LB II) building. The Stratum III (tenth-century) builders might have removed Stratum IV (Iron I) remains, but they left intact the large LB II building, which created a raised area in the south-eastern corner of Area II.2. Noteworthy small finds include a few thumb-impressed stamp handles, some metal fragments, a carnelian bead and a faience bead fragment. Communicated by J.P. Dessel, Eric M. Meyers and Carol L. Meyers Sha'ar ha-Golan, 1997 The Yarmukian culture of the Pottery Neolithic period at Sha'ar ha-Golan (grid ref. 207 232) was first identified by M. Stekelis, who worked at the site between 1948-1952 and who published the final excavation reports in Hebrew in 1966 and in English in 1972. New excavations at this major Neolithic site were initiated by Yosef Garfinkel on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who carried out excavation seasons in 1989, 1990 and 1996, prior to the 1997 season. Stekelis's excavations were carried out in four different areas, all of them several hundred metres away from the Yarmouk river bank. The new excavations focus on one area only, close to the river. Although the following report concentrates on the most recent excavation season, it summarises results of the previous three seasons as well. The Excavations The fourth season of excavations took place between 15 June and 31 July, 1997. The excavation area was doubled this year: from 350 to 750 sq.m. Rich assemblages of pottery, flint, stone artefacts, art objects and animal bones have been systematically collected by sieving the site sediment. A monumental building, partially uncovered in previous seasons, has now been completely exposed (Fig. 1). This 400 sq.m. complex is composed of one triangle-like courtyard surrounded by eight rooms. One room is rounded (a silo?); the others are either rectangular or square. Three are paved with flat basalt river pebbles. This structure is the earliest example in Israel of 'courtyard building', which was very common in the ancient Near East and which is still used nowadays by traditional village communities. The building has one entrance, from the street directly into an enclosed, open courtyard, which served as the centre of the building and in which most of the activities took place. A series of roofed rooms, smaller than the courtyard,</page><page sequence="12">272 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 1. Sha'ar ha-Golan, 1997: the completely excavated monumental building. is located around it and open onto it. Some of them may have served for dwelling and others for storage. Three outstanding finds have been discovered in the monumental building, suggesting that the building functioned as an important trade and cultic centre: 1. Mediterranean sea shells, which would have had to have been transferred over a distance of 60 km.; 2. Artefacts made of obsidian, a volcanic glass mineral found only in Anatolia and which testifies, therefore, to an exchange network that spanned some 700 km.; 3. An unusually large clay statue of an anthropomorphic figure (Fig. 2). Another clay figurine was found in a pit, north of the structure (Fig. 3). East of the monumental building there is a curved alley, and further east the edge of a second large complex is beginning to emerge. West of the completely uncovered monumental building there is a 3 m. wide straight street, and the edge of a third large complex is beginning to appear at the other side of the street. This building is very promising, since the areas so far excavated in it are richer in finds than those of the first monumental building. The finds include: two basalt mortars (one with a pastel still lying in it); 12 stone weights; a basalt pebble with 11 parallel straight lines incised on one side and a central groove (interpreted by some as a symbol of the female sex organ) on the other; a clay cylinder pointed at both edges (sometimes interpreted as symbolising the male sex organ); a zoomorphic clay figurine; an anthropomorphic pebble figurine; and pottery sherds with elaborate decorations. The fact that so many items have been discovered lying on the floors of this house suggests that its inhabitants did not abandon it, and still expected to use it.</page><page sequence="13">NOTES AND NEWS 273 The concentration of three such large structures indicates that we are currently excavating the heart of the ancient village of Sha'ar ha-Golan. Sha'ar ha-Golan is exceptional in the fact that over the years more than 150 prehistoric art objects have been collected from the surface by local farmers, rather than in the course of scientific excavations. Thus, no Fig. 2. Sha'ar ha-Golan, 1997: anthropomorphic clay statue. Only the head and a leg have been preserved. Fig. 3. Sha'ar ha-Golan, 1997: anthropomorphic clay figure. information has been available concerning the function of these objects in the Neolithic community. Following the 1997 excavation season, it is now clear that this rich symbolic expression is associated with a well planned village and monumental architecture, the earliest to have been discovered in Israel. Communicated by Yosef Garfinkel Tel Hamid (The Lower Terrace), 1995, 1996 A trial excavation followed by a salvage excav ation were carried out at the site, sponsored by the 'Cross Israel Highway Ltd.\ on behalf</page><page sequence="14">274 NOTES AND NEWS of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, and directed by Oren Tal. The first season of excavations took place during September-October 1995, and the second during August-September 1996. Area supervisors were: N. Blockman (both seasons), Y. Tepper (1995), D. Reshef-Rappaport (1995) and A. Fantalkin (1996). The staff also included: E. Tischler (administrator, 1995), G. Kobo (draughtsman), P. Shrago (photographer), U. Bason (geophysical surveying, 1995), J. Dekel (plans and drawing, 1995) and O. Paran (plans and drawing, 1996), R. Pinchas and A. Perry (pottery drawing, 1995), Y. Kapelyan (pottery drawing, 1996) and M. Sade (archaeozoology, 1996). The Excavations This site is located in the margin of the Ayalon Valley, about 2.5 km. south-east of the city of Ramla and 5 km. north-west of Tel Gezer. The lower terrace, where the excavations took place, is an alluvial plain west of Tel Hamid at about 71 m. elevation, in which the future 'Cross Israel Highway' is planned to be constructed (grid ref. 13966 14591 to 13964 14589). In the excavated unit, a latent sweet-water level was noted c. 3 m. below the surface; at its northern end bedrock was encountered 1.50-3.50 m. below the surface. The latent water level probably originated at the adjacent brook of Nahal Gezer. During the excavations, more than 50 probes (mostly c. 25 m. in length, 1 m. in width and 3.5 m. in depth) were opened by means of mechanical tools and four areas (A-D) were excavated manually. The location of the probes and the excavation areas was determined on the basis of subterranean foundations present at the site. Area A, in the northern part of the excavated unit, revealed scant remains of an occupation layer, composed of a plaster foundation and above it partly preserved white rough mosaic stones, about 1 m. below surface level. It seems that this occupation layer is part of an industrial installation that was not preserved. It apparently dates from the Byzantine period (mainly fifth-seventh centuries C.E.), as attested by a broken Palestinian bag-shaped jar that was found on the floor. An additional probe in the area revealed a massive wall under the latent water level. Within this level, several sherds of Persian date were noted. Area B, in the southern part of the excavated unit, was dug in a new grid of squares, 1 1 m. each, laid upon the earlier grid (Fig. 1). About 1.50 m. below the surface several lens-shaped occupation layers were revealed within the alluvial soil, composed of stones, clay lumps, ceramic and lithic artefacts, and organic finds such as animal bones (mainly OvisI Capra, Bos taurus and Sus scrofa) and shells. These layers were irregular in shape, measuring 0.50-4 sq.m. in size and 0.05-0.45 m. in depth. The total depth of occupation remains did not exceed 1.30 m. Each occupation layer was excavated as a single locus divided into stratigraphie units of c. 0.10 m. which were sifted after excavation. All occupation layers have yielded mixed ceramic and lithic remains which belong mainly to 'Jericho IX' and 'Wadi Rabah' cultures, and to the Chalcolithic period and the Intermediate Bronze Age. This long occupation seems to be due to the proximity to water sources. However, its small size (less than half a dunam in area) and its disordered stratigraphie condition and mixed loci may indicate a temporary occupation in each period, which may be due to several changes in the latent water level. Area C, in the northern part of the excavated unit, revealed a stone circle (diameter: 0.60 m.), about 2.4 m. below surface level. Only four courses were preserved, of which the lower three were actually discovered within the latent water level. The excavation of this circle has not yielded any finds. It seems probable that this installation is an ancient well, which</page><page sequence="15">NOTES AND NEWS 275 Fig 1. Tel Hamid (the lower terrace), Area (view to the south-east). apparently served the inhabitants of the site during at least one of the stages present in Area B. In several loci around this stone circle we noted animal bones (Bos taurus and Sus scrofa) and other sporadic ceramic and lithic artefacts from different periods (Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Intermediate Bronze Age). Area D, in the northern part of the excavated unit, revealed an arc-shaped foundation of fired mudbrick (diameter: c. 1.75 m.), about 0.60 m. below surface level. The outer contour of this foundation was covered with stone and plaster casing. This is most likely a kiln foundation. About 10 m. north of the fired mudbrick found ation, a refuse pit (diameter: c. 1 m.; depth: 0.50 m.) was discovered. Slags and broken ridge-necked jars were noted, some of which were disformed, making restoration impossible. The pit may have served the potters using the kiln. If so, one may assign a date to the kiln by the ridge-necked jars, which are of a well-known type of Middle Roman-Early Byzantine date (late first-fifth centuries C.E.). The kiln was thus in use sometime during these periods. It should be noted that an additional kiln of a similar layout, which may have been contemporaneous, was discovered on the western slope of Tel Hamid.
