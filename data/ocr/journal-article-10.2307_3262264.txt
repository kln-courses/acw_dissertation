<plain_text><page sequence="1">MONOTHEISM AND THE RELIGION OF ISRAEL THEOPHILE JAMES MEEK THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO NO MODERN scholar of any standing today believes that the Hebrews of the Patriarchal Period were anything but polytheistic,' but there are some who still maintain that Moses was a monotheist. The most outstanding scholar to do this is W. F. Albright. For many years he simply asserted the fact with practically no argumentation. He discussed the matter briefly in his Archaeology of Palestine and the Bible (1931, 163- 167) and in an article in the American Scholar, VII (1938), 186 f., entitled "Archaeology Confronts Biblical Criticism." The few arguments there presented were subjected to criticism by the present writer2 and seem to have been abandoned by their author because they do not appear in later discussions of the subject. Of these discussions the article entitled "The Ancient Near East and the Religion of Israel"3 promised much, but despite its title it has practically nothing to say about the religion of Israel. Finally came the author's learned volume, From the Stone Age to Christianity: Monotheism and the Historical Process, 1940, and here at last we have his detailed arguments. It is the purpose of this paper to subject these to a critical appraisal.4 'Best and most recently demonstrated by H. G.

The present article was written by invitation of the editors of JBL on the suggestion of Professor Albright who desired a critical appraisal by someone who disagreed with his views. 21</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE In our discussion of the subject it is essential that we agree on the definition of monotheism, and to agree on this it is neces- sary that we follow the accepted meaning of the word. If mono- theism means anything at all, it means, as the dictionaries assert, "the belief that there is but one God," and if this means anything at all it means that a monotheist is one who believes that there is only one God (with a capital g) and definitely does not believe in the existence of any others. Hence there cannot be grades of monotheism. A man either believes in the existence of one God only or he does not. There can be grades of approximation to monotheism, but not of monotheism itself. It is accordingly most unscientific to call something monotheism that is not mono- theism, and yet this is continually being done. For various reasons the world came to think that monotheism is a higher form of religion than polytheism or henotheism. Hence the word is often applied to a form of religion that is not strictly mono- theistic by the false argumentation (so common today) that you can make something almost anything that you wish by calling it that. An example is found in Christianity. The leaders of the early Church presently found themselves in the position of believ- ing in three gods (Father, Son, and Holy SpiritS), but with their prejudice against polytheism they had to interpret these three gods in such a way as to bring them into a single godhead, and the result was the God of the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. In a sense, then, trinitarian Chris- tianity can be regarded as monotheistic, but by the same token modern Hinduism is also monotheistic, because the various gods in it are all regarded simply as forms or manifestations of the one God Vishnu (so according to one sect), or of Siva (so accord- ing to the other sect). But even though we grant that trinitarian Christianity is monotheistic, that has no bearing on the possible monotheism of Moses because he lived in a totally different age and his concept of deity must have been totally different. The Christian concept is metaphysical and was the result of years of s In some regions this took the form so common in other religions, Father, Mother (Mary), and Son, the trinitarianism which Muhammad knew and condemned so roundly in the Qur'an (see, e.g., 5 ll6 f.). 22</page><page sequence="3">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL controversy and argumentation. That of Moses is practical and was the result of personal experience.6 Unfortunately Albright nowhere tells us exactly what he means by monotheism, but in a personal letter to the present writer he defined it thus: "Monotheism is the belief in one God. This does not imply anything about the essential nature of God, other than the universally held belief in the unique power and goodness of God. God may be represented or conceived to exist in any suit- able form - anthropomorphic or celestial. God may be a simple or a complex essence; there is nothing in the definition, either historically or philosophically, to preclude trinitarian mono- theism. Nor does monotheism exclude the coexistence of other spiritual or superhuman powers in the world, as long as these entities are in no way comparable with God in his essential qual- ities, such as power and goodness."7 To my mind this is not a definition of monotheism at all, but it might be regarded as a possible definition of henotheism, for "henotheism explicitly recognizes one deity superior to other deities or spirits, whereas monotheism holds that there is one and only one deity."8 In Albright's definition the word is used very loosely, whereas it really has a precise meaning, and in a scientific paper a word ought to carry one definite concept and not a variety of concepts. If a belief is not monotheistic in the strict sense of the word, I do not see what we have gained by calling it monotheistic, unless we do this as a sop to orthodoxy. Albright wrote his book to demonstrate, among other things, that tradition was correct in making Moses a monotheist (p. 309), but his conception of a monotheist is assuredly not that of tra- dition. Albright makes Moses only a kind of monotheist and not a monotheist like Philo Judaeus or Rabbi Aqiba, St. Paul or St. Augustine, Muhammad or Maimonides, St. Thomas or 6 Cf. Albright, op. cit., 84, who describes the age in which Moses lived as one in which the highest thought drew its sanctions from the results of experience and not from formal canons of thinking, as in the period beginning with the 5th century B.

Tradition would repudiate, as we have already done, the contention that there are different kinds of monotheism or that the monotheism of Moses was any different from that of any other monotheist. Hence Albright is strictly not supporting the traditional view at all, but only his interpretation of that view, and in his pose as a vindicator of tradition he lends himself to misuse by the fundamentalists in their efforts to cast aspersions upon critical scholarship and belittle it. In the last analysis why should any scholar be concerned to vindicate tradition? Why should tradition be considered so sacrosanct? There is nothing in the literature stemming from Moses to say that he was a monotheist. That tradition was created by the pious religionists of the Jewish and Christian Churches who uncritically read their own views back into the past. If tradition had not made Moses out to be a mono- theist, it certainly would never have occurred to any modern critical scholar to do so. In this tradition it is not the Bible that is speaking, but late, theologically biased notions about the Bible. Albright's book is not easy to read, and there is such a mass of detail that it is difficult at times to follow his reasoning; it is hard to see the wood for the trees. The book, too, is strikingly lacking in quotations and citations from the Bible. The Bible is our one source of information about Moses and yet in Albright's book we have only general statements about the beliefs of Moses and no proof-texts to back up these statements. As a matter of fact there are no proof-texts. In a footnote on another topic (p. 331, n. 29), however, Albright does quote the second half of the First Command of the Decalogue, which he translates 9 Albright is not altogether consistent here with his statement on p. 309: "Moses was as much a monotheist as was Hillel, though his point of view may have been very different." Cf. also JBL, LIX (1940), 111: "Only the most extreme criticism can see any appreciable difference between the God of Moses in JE and the God of Jeremiah, or between the God of Elijah and the God of Deutero-Isaiah. .... A balanced organismic position may consis- tently hold that the religion of Moses and of Elijah, of David and of the Psalmists was the same in all essentials, just as the religion of Jesus was substantially identical with that of St. Francis and the faith of St. Paul was also the faith of Augustine." 24</page><page sequence="5">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL "Thou shalt not prefer other gods to me."IO This rendering, he asserts, agrees with the plain meaning of 'al panai in several other passages; e. g., Gen 16 12, 50 i; 2 Ki 13 14; Deut 21 16. But in these passages the only one that can possibly have the meaning for which he argues is the last, and even here another possible rendering of the expression in question is "to the disadvantage of" and this has just as good support as "in preference to." The expression is one that appears rather often in the OT, but unfor- tunately with a great variety of meanings; e. g., "over," "in front of," "in the presence of," "on an equality with," "along- side of," "to the disadvantage of," "in preference to," "in addi- tion to," "in defiance of," "during the life-time of." In most occurrences the particular meaning intended is indicated with more or less certainty by the context, but in the case of the First Command the context is altogether too slight to indicate explic- itly what meaning was intended. However, even though we accept Albright's rendering, there is nothing in the command to suggest anything other than henotheism or monolatry. This has been the verdict of practically all scholars, even those of very conservative persuasion." The whole command reads as follows: "Since I, Yahweh, am your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of a state of slavery,12 you must have no other gods in preference to me." If this is the correct rendering (and it follows that of Albright), the words can mean only that there are other gods beside Yahweh, but the Hebrews are to prefer 'O There is no certainty of course that this command originated with Moses or was known in his day, but we can probably grant Albright's contention on p. 205 that it is in general accord with the movement which bears the name of Moses. " For example, the Lutheran Church is one of our most conservative denominations and yet one of its theological professors, Harold L. Creager, writes concerning the First Command in its official organ, The Lutheran Church Quarterly, VII (1934), 279: "In neither case [of two possible transla- tions, "in addition to" and "in preference to"], of course, is there any teach- ing here of monotheism, but only of henotheism. The possibility of worship- ping other gods, either along with Jehovah or as entirely displacing him, is distinctly contemplated." 2 For the contention that this clause is circumstantial and is integral to the command, see the present writer, JAOS, LVIII (1938), 126 f. 25</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE none of these to him because it was he who showed himself to be their particular God by rescuing them from Egypt. Albright stands quite alone in his contention that there is any evidence here for monotheism. Another passage quoted by Albright is found on p. 227 in con- nection with his discussion of angels. It is Deut 32 8 f., where he takes issue with the present writer's rendering of the fourth hemistich, "To the various deities."13 Literally translated, the words read (with the LXX and Old Latin) "according to the number of the sons of God," which Albright interprets as mean- ing simply "according to the number of the stars," but to get this meaning for "sons of God" he has recourse to Job 38 7. That is, to determine the meaning of a passage which he dates in the seventh century B. C. (p. 227) he uses a passage which he dates in the fifth century (pp. 227, 253), two hundred years later. This surely is not scientific exegesis and is absolutely contrary to the rules laid down in the early part of his book (pp. 14-19) where, among other things, he stresses the fact that the up-to-date linguist must be scrupulously careful to limit his study of a word to a given historical phase of a language. Hence it is altogether unscientific to determine the meaning of a word in pre-exilic Hebrew from its usage in post-exilic Hebrew, which represents a radical change in the language, as everyone knows. However, it is by no means certain that "sons of God" means "angels" even in Job 38 7. Many scholars maintain that "sons of God" here has its earlier meaning, "individuals of the class god, mem- bers of the divine order, deities," just as "sons of man" means "individuals of the class man, members of the human race, human beings," and "sons of the prophets" means "members of the prophetic order."'4 Albright recognizes this common Semitic usage of "son" in the expression "son of man" (p. 291), in the expression "sons of the prophets" (p. 234), and in the expression "sons of God" when used in Canaanite (p. 226), but only in Gen 6 2 when used in Hebrew (pp. 226 f.). Why he should limit the usage so narrowly in Hebrew, which is nothing other than 13 Review of Religion, IV (1940), 302. 14 See, e.g., Driver and Gray, Job (ICC), I, 1921, 9 f. 26</page><page sequence="7">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL Canaanite as spoken by the Hebrews, when he recognizes it as so general in Canaanite and other Semitic languages, he does not indicate. It is true, as he says (pp. 226 f.), that later Jews and Christians interpreted the phrase "sons of God" as meaning "angels," but he presents no evidence that this was the meaning intended by the writers who used it or the early exegesis of it, nor is there any evidence anywhere that it had anything other than its general Semitic meaning until late in Jewish history. Hence our translation of the fourth hemistich in Deut 32 s is completely vindicated: "To the various deities," where the expression "according to the number of" is taken as distributive in accordance with the rules of Hebrew syntax (cf. Josh 4 5, s). Whether, in the same passage, Elyon is to be distinguished from Yahweh, as I suggested,I5 may be an open question, but it is possible, if not exceedingly probable. Albright himself recognizes that Elyon was a high god of the pre-Mosaic Hebrews (p. 188) and he also recognizes the fact that this passage, like a number of others in the poem, is full of Canaanite reminiscences, as we know from Ugaritic literature (p. 227), and this is made all the more certain by the introduction to the passage, vs. 7: Remember the days of old, Review the years, age after age; Ask your father, and he will inform you; Your elders, and they will tell you: And the writer then proceeds in the following verses to quote, probably from similar words in an old Canaanite epic, what they will say: "When Elyon gave heritages to the nations, When he made divisions among mankind, He assigned the realms of the nations To the various deities; And Yahweh's apportionment was his people; Jacob, the allotment for him to receive." IS Op. cit., 302. It was only later that I discovered that Budde had made the same suggestion in Das Lied Mose's: Deut. 32, 1920, 18 f.; and in JBL, XL (1921), 41 f. 27</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE If these verses are actually based on an old Canaanite epic, there can be no doubt whatever that by "sons of God" the author meant "deities." In the original source it probably meant "sons of El,"'6 but it is not likely that this meaning was carried over into the Hebrew. In any case the passage cannot be interpreted as reflecting a monotheistic religion, nor can another passage somewhat similar to it in Deut 4 19: Beware, when you lift your eyes to the heavens and see all the host of the heavens, the sun, the moon, and the stars, that you do not let your- self be allured into paying homage to them and serving them, whom Yahweh, your God, has alloted to all the peoples everywhere under the heavens. Albright tries to avoid the implications of this passage by affirm- ing that it says only that the heavenly bodies have been assigned by Yahweh to all nations alike (p. 245), but he has to acknowl- edge that the usual interpretation is possible. It is surely the only possible one. From the early rabbinical commentators down to the present day the plain meaning of the passage has been taken to be that Yahweh allotted the gods to the various nations, and that is confirmed by the unequivocal terms of Deut 29 25, which Albright completely ignores: They [the Hebrews] went and served alien gods and paid homage to them, gods of whom they had no experience and whom he [Yahweh] did not allot to them. Since Albright has Hebrew monotheism develop directly and immediately out of polytheism (p. 86), he leaves no loom for anything like henotheism as an intermediate stage. In fact he denies that there are any evidences anywhere for henotheism (p. 143).I7 If henotheism is defined with the New Standard Dic- tionary as "the belief in a special supreme god for each region, I6 Cf. H. G. May, JBL, LX (1941), 118, n. 11. '7 See also JBL, LIX (1940), 103, 110, 112. On the other hand contrast this with the implication on p. 220 of his book that the Moabites were heno- theists; also with an earlier statement in the American Scholar, VII (1938), 187: "It is singularly lacking in historical logic to insist that because we find undoubted indications of henotheism in the traditions of early Israel all Israelites must have been henotheists." In his book (pp. 159 ff.) and in his 28</page><page sequence="9">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL race, or nation," that must surely be the plain meaning of the passages just discussed: Deut 32 8 f., 4 19, 29 25. It is also the plain meaning of another passage, Judg 11 24: Should you not occupy the territory of those whom Chemosh, your own god, drives out, while we occupy the territory of those whom Yahweh, our God, has driven out of our way? Albright regards this "parade example of early Israelite heno- theism" as singularly weak (p. 220), but we cannot help but regard his arguments against it as singularly weak. In the first place he says that the passage cannot be older than the eighth JBL article (pp. 102 ff.) Albright attempts to show that most peoples of the ancient Near East attained monotheism, a point of view with which the present writer has already expressed disagreement in his Hebrew Origins, 1936, 180 ff.; see especially p. 198: "Strictly speaking it [monotheism by syncretism] was not monotheism, because no effort was made to suppress any of the minor cults or priesthoods, or any of the local features of the cults. The several cults continued as always, with no change except the identification of the local gods with the state god. The movement was pan- theistic, but not reformatory" (cf. also pp. 187 f., 197). This is an important point which Albright has completely ignored. If he had taken account of it, he could scarcely have said, as he does on p. 165 of his book, that the "incor- poration of all the gods and goddesses in one all-embracing deity is mono- theistic to the extent that it eliminates all but one god from ultimate theo- logical reality." But does it? The illustration that he uses, from a cuneiform document identifying various deities with parts of Ninurta's body, not so much represents a denial of the individual deities mentioned as it attempts to weave them into a theological system; and not a single god is eliminated from the pantheon or cultus, any more than Tanit was eliminated from the Carthaginian pantheon and cultus when he was called "the face of Baal." Furthermore, against Albright's implication on p. 161 that the plural of "god" means "God" only in Hebrew we may note the place-names, Ash- taroth and Anathoth, and the plural, "my gods, my sun-gods," in the sense of "my God, my Sun-god" in the Amarna letters. All these plurals are instances of a common Semitic idiom, the plural of majesty, and carry no theological implications at all. It may be true, as Albright asserts on p. 170, that Egyptian gods were freely identified with the leading deities of Western Asia, but one cannot but challenge his further statement that the patron deity of the Egyptian king was also the chief god of Canaanites, Hittites, and Mesopotamians. This would mean that the Babylonians, for example, replaced their chief god, Marduk, by some Egyptian god, but of this there is no evidence whatsoever. 29</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE century B. C. and hence cannot prove henotheism in the time of the Judges, and yet over and over again in his book he argues for the trustworthiness of the biblical records irrespective of their date and for the reconstruction of the religion of Moses he uses records which by his own confession are much later than Moses. His second argument is that the passage does not prove heno- theism for any period because the speaker is represented as addressing an alien, henotheistic people and hence is made to speak to them ad hominem, in henotheistic terms, but this does not imply henotheism for himself. Besides contradicting his earlier statement that henotheism was not to be found anywhere in the ancient Orient, this interpretation has all the objections that so condemned the allegorical method of interpretation: it can make anything mean almost anything, or worse still, nothing at all. If this passage were the only one in the OT that indicated henotheism, there might be some ground for suspecting it, but over and over again in the early records of Israel the Hebrews are represented as Yahweh's peculiar people, just as the Moab- ites, for example, are represented as the peculiar people of Chemosh, and the reality and power of these other gods are no more doubted than those of Yahweh himself, but these several gods belong each to his own people. Even as late as 1 Sam 26 19 f.'8 and 2 Ki 5 17 (both passages ignored by Albright) Yahweh is definitely represented as confined territorially to the land that the Hebrews occupied, and that is henotheism according to our definition of the word.I9 In the present volume (p. 80) and elsewhere20 Albright criticises the Wellhausen school for telescoping the evolution of Hebrew monotheism into an impossibly brief period, but he himself tele- scopes it into a much briefer one. According to the former, true monotheism did not appear until the later prophets, many hun- dreds of years after the Patriarchal period, which most members of the school have been accustomed to date c. 2000 B. C. or 18 Albright's ad hominem argument cannot apply here because it is two Hebrews that are involved, David and Saul. I9 For a more elaborate discussion of Hebrew henotheism and its gradual development into monotheism see the present writer, op. cit., 191-203. 20 See, e.g., JBL, LIX (1940), 100. 30</page><page sequence="11">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL earlier.2I According to Albright (p. 86) monotheism appeared full-blown with Moses c. 1200 B. C. (a "lofty monotheism" he calls it on p. 214), and it was immediately preceded by a religion much more crassly polytheistic and dynamistic than Wellhausen ever conceived it. Albright condenses into a few years as the work of one man what the Wellhausen school spread over hun- dreds of years as the cumulative work of many men.22 He accounts for this abrupt break with the past as an example of evolutionary mutation comparable to the abrupt breaks that came with Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, following the eruption of which they remained more or less static in their doc- trines, even as Mosaism did.23 But did any of these religions suddenly erupt without causal relationship to previous move- ments and did they remain static? This is not the teaching of history. Albright ignores movements like that represented in the Upanishads which helped to create Buddhism and a move- ment like that represented in Mahayana Buddhism which con- stituted an even greater break with orthodox (Hinayana) Buddhism than the latter had been with its predecessors. Before Albright can use other religions to illustrate his interpretation of Mosaism, he must prove his thesis for the other religions because his interpretation of them is not the accepted one. If there is any one thing upon which students of religion are agreed, 21 This date we know now to be considerably too early. It was based on the date of Hammurabi, whose date we know now to be c. 1792-c. 1750 B. C.; see W. F. Albright, BASOR, No. 77 (1940), pp. 25-30; A. Ungnad, Archiv fur Orientforschung, XIII (1940), 145 f.; S. Smith, Alalakh and Chronology, 1940; 0. Neugebauer, JAOS, LXI (1941), 58 ff. 22 This was definitely an evolutionary process and not a mutation, as Albright labels it in the American Scholar, VII (1938), 187. But even if it were a mutation, he surely cannot deny to his opponents what he claims for himself in making the work of Moses a mutation. 23 So also in JBL, LIX (1940), 111: "Only the most extreme criticism can see any appreciable difference between the God of Moses in JE and the God of Jeremiah, or between the God of Elijah and the God of Deutero- Isaiah." This is an astounding statement to come from a modern scholar and one that every other scholar must challenge. Contrast an earlier state- ment in the American Scholar, VI (1938), 187, where in arguing against the late appearance of monotheism in Israel he says: "Of course there was religious evolution between 1200 and 600 B. C." 31</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE it is that religions do not flower full-blown over night and they can never stand still; they must either go forward or die. Even so conservative an ethnologist as Wilhelm Schmidt recognizes this when he speaks of "that fossilization and loss of inner vitality which is inseparately connected with a state of rest, and is espe- cially fatal to anything so essentially spiritual as religion."24 Albright's thesis is of course a possible one (almost anything is possible), but the other is much the more probable and more in accord with the possibilities in the case and with the development of monotheism elsewhere. In summarizing his arguments for the appearance of mono- theism with Moses Albright says (p. 207): "If the term 'mono- theist' means one who teaches the existence of only one God, the creator of everything,25 the source of justice, who is equally powerful in Egypt, in the desert, and in Palestine, who has no 24 Origin and Growth of Religion, 1931, 255; cf. also 289 f. 25 Part of the evidence for Yahweh as creator Albright finds in the name itself, which he interprets (p. 198) as an abbreviation of Yahweh asher yihweh, "He causes to be what comes into existence." This is of course only one of several possible explanations of the name (see, e.g., the present writer, op. cit., 100 ff.). Albright tries to support it by a supposed parallel with the Ugaritic god-name Al'iyan, which he interprets as an abbreviation of a longer title, "I prevail ('al'iyu) over the champions whom I meet in the land of battle," but it is much more likely that the longer title arose out of the shorter as a play on the name Al'iyan or on the title of Al'iyan, viz., 'al'iy qrdm, suggesting that the title in Ex 3 14, "I am who I am," may have arisen similarly out of Yahweh. The longer title could arise out of the shorter just as easily as the shorter out of the longer and this is much more likely to have occurred because the Near Easterners were all very fond of parono- masia. Albright's further contention (p. 197) that the form Yahweh is more original than Yahu or Yah ignores the present writer's objection (op. cit., 100) that the form Yahweh is never found either in or out of the OT as an element in personal names where of all places it ought to be found if it is an original form and not a later artificial one, as the present writer believes (op. cit., 100 ff.). Despite the many epithets applied to Yahweh which suggest to most scholars his origin as a storm-god (see, e.g., the present writer, op. cit., 92 ff.), Albright emphatically rejects this derivation on p. 200, but on p. 218 he actually calls Yahweh a storm-god. Albright believes that Yahweh was God in the highest sense of the word from the beginning, with little or no change thereafter (see n. 9 above) and that he was introduced to the Hebrews by Moses, but on this latter point the OT itself is divided in its opinion, as is well known (see, e.g., the present writer, op. cit., 85 f.). 32</page><page sequence="13">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL sexuality and no mythology, who is human in form but cannot be seen by human eye and cannot be represented in any form- then the founder of Yahwism was certainly a monotheist." Of these several items only one or two have any real bearing on the question of monotheism. All of the polytheistic peoples of the ancient Near East thought of their chief god as creator of every- thing, equally powerful for his own people in all lands,26 human in form, and rarely, if ever, seen by human eye.27 It is true that in the records as preserved to us Yahweh has no sexuality and little or no mythology.28 This is likewise true of the early Chinese gods and is accoidingly no evidence for monotheism. It is very debatable whether Moses taught that Yahweh could not be represented in any form.29 He may have done so, but even that 26 Cf. Albright, op. cit., 143: "The cosmic gods of Mesopotamia were naively and unquestionably believed to rule the entire world, each in his own designated sphere or function." Why this conception of deity should be "naive" in Mesopotamia, but monotheistic in Israel, is not clear. 27 It is true that the ancients had images of their gods, but they did not regard the image itself as god; it was simply the dwelling-place of deity. God was a spirit (rarefied, ethereal matter) who was thought to take up his residence in the image only through the medium of certain rites. 28 There is good reason to believe that Yahweh had both originally and that these features came to be suppressed in our records, leaving only vestiges and reminiscences here and there, vestiges that are becoming more and more apparent with our increasing knowledge of Canaanite mythology as revealed in the Ugaritic literature. 29 Albright goes so far as to say (pp. 202 f.) that there never were represen- tations of deity in early Israel, but that makes it difficult to understand why there should have been the admonition not to make images. Laws in ancient times were always introduced to correct abuses, not to anticipate them. Albright further contends (pp. 203, 229 f.) that the bull-image, rather fre- quently mentioned and condemned in the OT, was no image at all, but the pedestal upon which the god was enthroned, but this would seem to be a very far-fetched and unnatural interpretation as against the plain reading of the biblical text. It is true that ancient Near Eastern iconography often represents deity as standing on the back of an animal or as sitting on a throne borne by animals, but how the biblical writers could have confused the god with his support is not easy to see. Furthermore, Albright's assertion (p. 229) that the gods were never represented among the Canaanites, Arameans, and Hittites in animal form, does not accord with his statement on p. 201 that "Near-Eastern gods shifted in disconcerting fashion from astral form to zoomorphic, dendromorphic, and composite manifestations," nor is it borne 33</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE would not make him a monotheist. Until the coming of Bud- dhism into their land the Chinese had no images of their gods nor did the early Aryans of India, and there is reason to believe that the Assyrians had no image of their chief god Ashur. This leaves only one item, the contention that Moses taught the exist- ence of only one God, but what evidence does Albright present in proof of this? Nothing at all, so far as I can discover, other than the items just mentioned, and these assuredly do not prove monotheism. As a matter of fact there is no assurance that Moses taught any of them; it is purely a subjective inference without historical basis, because we do not have enough veri- fiable information about Moses to know exactly what he did teach. Albright argues (p. 192) that the stories of Moses, transmitted orally for four centuries or more before being put into fixed form, are at least as historically reliable as the accounts of Zoroaster and Gautama, which were transmitted much longer by oral tradition, and in this he is perfectly right. But the catch here is that we have very little dependable information about either Zoroaster or Gautama. In fact we have so little about Zoroaster that we cannot even date him with any certainty, and the data for his religion are so obscure and conflicting that no two special- ists agree in their interpretation of the evidence, as Albright himself recognizes later in his volume (p. 276). In an earlier out by the facts. For example, the representation of a lion bearing the symbol of deity, the star, has been found in several excavations in Palestine: R. A. S. Macalister, The Excavation of Gezer, II, 1912, 442, fig. 524; G. A. Reisner Harvard Excavations at Samaria, 1924, I, 333; II, pl. 80; G. Schumacher, Tell el-Mutesellim, 1908, 88, fig. 128; and A.

On p. 230 of his book Albright suggests that Jeroboam may well have been harking back to early Israelite traditional practice when he made the golden bulls. It has long been the present writer's contention, as against current opinion, that these bulls were not images of Yahweh at all, but of the bull god, and represent a revival of the early religion of the Israelites of the north and a defection from Yahwism, as the OT itself asserts over and over again (see AJSL, XXXVII [1921], 121, 129; XLV [1929], 150 ff.; Hebrew Origins, 1936, 136, 158 ff., 162). 34</page><page sequence="15">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL volume he said concerning both Buddhism and Zoroasterianism that "the amount of dogma and teaching which can be traced back to the founders is very small indeed."30 There was a time when we had complete and detailed biographies of every great religious leader: Moses, Jesus, Zoroaster, Gautama, Laotze, Con- fucius, Mvuhammad, and the others. Modern historical criticism, however, has reduced these biographies to very small propor- tions, and that of Moses has shared the fate of all the others. Since we have no autobiography of Moses, in fact no account of him at all that can be dated earlier than several centuries after his death, as Albright himself recognizes,3I it is impossible to say with certainty what he did or did not teach. At best the OT account can be credited only with general and not with detailed accuracy, and the reconstruction of the life and teach- ings of Moses derived from that account must be very largely subjective.32 If modern historians cannot agree (as they cannot) 30 The Archaeology of Palestine and the Bible, 1931, 168. 31 Albright dates our earliest sources for the life of Moses, the documents J and E, between 925 and 750 B. C. (pp. 190 f.). He differs from current opinion in making the documents two recensions of a single original epic narrative (pp. 183, 189), which view is a strange mixture of modern critical opinion and old-time orthodoxy because it rests on the old belief that the Hebrews were a unit from the beginning and remained a unit until the death of Solomon, going down into Egypt and coming out of Egypt as a single body, invading and conquering Palestine as a single body under a single head, and remaining a single body until the secession of Israel from Judah. Albright does not say explicitly that this is his view, but there are hints of it here and there and his interpretation of J and E absolutely requires it. It is a view of early Hebrew history that has long since been discarded by critical opinion and is true neither to the biblical records nor the extra-biblical, as has been shown by many scholars; see, e.g., the present writer, op. cit., 1-45, 76 f., 111 f. Occasionally (e.g., pp. 225, 243) Albright recognizes that there were dialectical differences between the Hebrew of the north and that of the south, but in line with his interpretation of early Hebrew history he invariably uses the term "Israel" to include both Israel and Judah, whereas the two ought to be distinguished. 32 As proof of its subjective character it is sufficient to note that Albright attributes the prohibition of images (p. 202) and the Sabbath law (p. 205) to Moses, whereas Pfeiffer, Introduction to the Old Testament, 1941, 231, says emphatically "It can positively be asserted that he [Moses] was concerned neither with images nor with the Sabbath." The reconstruction of the life of 35</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE about the life and teachings of men like Lincoln and Washington33 concerning whom we have such abundant contemporary records, and hence cannot speak with certainty about them, it is surely most presumptuous on our part to say that we can speak with certainty about Moses. There is much of truth in what Albright says about tradition (pp. 33 ff.), but it can never have the accu- racy that he accords it.34 Even contemporary written records are always biased and hence not absolutely accurate, as modern historians are discovering in the case of Lincoln and Washington and hosts of others. In the last analysis the chief approach to an understanding of what Moses actually taught must be the psychological one. We do know something of the milieu in which Moses lived and we are all pretty well agreed about that milieu that toward the end of the second millenium B. C., somewhere in the southern Negeb,35 he gathered about himself a number of wandering tribes and consolidated them into a religious and political confederacy and thus laid the foundations for the nation and its religion. But monotheism to be monotheism must tran- scend national limitations; it must be supernational and uni- Moses must be greatly influenced by the theological bias of the investigator. The less biased he is, the more objective will be his findings, but all of us have some theological bias and most of us carry it over into our OT studies with the result that we are too often explaining away facts instead of discover- ing them. 33 Each succeeding biographer accuses his predecessors of inaccuracies. See, e.g., Bernhard Knollenberg's severe indictment of earlier historians of Wash- ington as inexcusably biased and quite unreliable as to both facts and inter- pretation in his Washington and the Revolution: A Reappraisal, 1940. Cf. also S. G. Fisher, "The Legendary and Myth-making Process in Histories of the American Revolution," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, LI (1912), 53-76. 34 Albright himself shows how tradition tends to change and enlarge the original story and in the case of the book of Jubilees, for example, he shows (pp. 266 f.) how very inaccurate the tradition ultimately became as a result of these changes. 35 Probably at Kadesh, as most scholars believe, rather than at Sinai-Horeb, as Albright seems to believe. In any case Sinai is to be located somewhere in the neighborhood of Kadesh as against the traditional identification with Jebel Musa (apparently followed by Albright), which cannot be traced much earlier than Justinian (527-565 A. D.). 36</page><page sequence="17">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL versal. The difference between Moses and Paul was that Paul was an internationalist. By no possible stretch of the imagination can it be said that the outlook of Moses was international. That would have been utterly impossible for him in the circumstances in which he found himself. He did the one thing that the situa- tion demanded and the one thing to which his followers were in a position to respond. He organized them into a confederacy or amphictyony, and he made the god Yahweh the God of the amphictyony and in his name made a covenant with the people that he was to be their God and they were to be his people. This was henotheism and not monotheism. It was the selection of one god out of many for exclusive worship by a particular group as a group, and such theological particularism, as always, was the inevitable growth and accompaniment of a political par- ticularism. As Principal W. C. Graham has well said, "Modes of theological thought never establish themselves as disembodied ideologies. They develop along with and inside of corresponding institutional structures."36 This point cannot be too strongly emphasized and yet Albright has completely ignored it, even though Graham's article was written as a reply to an earlier one of his own. A world concept politically, a world view is the necessary prerequisite to the idea of a world god. In the time of Moses the Hebrews were just learning to take their first steps in the direction of nationalism and were still a long way from internationalism. They could not possibly reach up to a world concept or a world god.37 It may be said with considerable assurance that Moses sowed the seeds of monotheism, but the real fruitage did not come until centuries later because it could not. An idea cannot be born before its day. It comes only "in the fulness of time," which, by the way, is Albright's heading to Chapter VI of his book. If there is any one thing that can be asserted about the god 36 American Scholar, VII (1938), 423. 3 Cf., e.g., J. Morgenstern, Hebrew Union College Annual, XV (1940), 283 ff., who shows that this concept with the Hebrews does not date earlier than Amos. 37</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE of Moses, it is that he was a jealous god,38 and that presupposes rival gods for the affection of the people, and there is nothing anywhere in the literature of the Hebrews to indicate that Moses or anyone else denied the reality of those rival gods until cen- turies after the time of Moses. It is true, as Albright notes (p. 251), that there is nothing in the earlier sources which sounds any more polytheistic than the words attributed by the Chron- icler to Solomon in 2 Chron 2 4, "For our God is greater than all gods." It is true also, as Albright further asserts (p. 331, n. 29), that Jews and Christians have recited the First Command of the Decalogue for twenty-five centuries without supposing that there were actually other gods in existence as rivals of Yahweh. But that was because monotheism was taken for granted since it had already been amply demonstrated and established as a fact. Until someone did establish it as a fact, however, and definitely show that all other gods but Yahweh were simply fig- ments of the imagination and had no reality, as did Deutero- Isaiah - then and then only could monotheism be taken for granted. That is why the Chronicler could have Solomon speak of Yahweh as "greater than all gods" without being considered a polytheist. That is why the Psalmist could exclaim "There is none like thee among the gods, O Lord!" (Ps 86 s) and not necessarily believe in other gods. That is why we in our own time can talk glibly about the gods as if they existed, as in cer- tain of our proverbial sayings, when we know of course that they do not exist. Once monotheism has been definitely demon- strated, then monotheism can be taken for granted among those acquainted with and accepting the demonstration, but only then. Somewhere, some time, someone must have demonstrated the non-reality of all gods but one, so that the idea became current as an accepted fact. But there is no evidence that such a demon- 38 Albright (p. 236) seems to date this concept back only to the prophetic age, but there is as much or more reason to date it back to Moses as many other things which Albright ascribes to him. It has the support of tradition and there is nothing in the milieu of Moses to make it psychologically im- probable. Albright notes, as Creager had done earlier ("The Jealous God,' Lutheran Church Quarterly, VII [1934], 271-282), that the basic sense of "to be jealous" is both "to be jealous" and "to be zealous." 38</page><page sequence="19">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL stration occurred for the Hebrew people before the time of Deutero-Isaiah;39 hence monotheism cannot be taken for granted earlier than his time and later monotheistic interpretations must not be read into the past, as Albright has done in the case of the First Command (p. 331, n. 29). This is an important point that has been completely ignored by all those who argue for the appearance of monotheism with Moses. Before Moses can be regarded as a monotheist, it must be proved that either he or someone before him or in his time demonstrated the non-reality of all gods but one and that this demonstration was so generally accepted by his people that it could be taken for granted. No one has proved that and presumptuous indeed is he who would claim to do so. Albright does not, although he does claim (p. 250) that epithets like "lies," "illusions," gilli2lm, and "no-gods," applied to pagan deities by certain prophets before Deutero- Isaiah, argue against the idea that these deities were conceded real existence. Albright does not cite the passages where these epithets occur and if he did it would be discovered that most of them are generally regarded as late (e.g., Deut 29 16; Jer 10 14 f., 50 2, 51 17 f.). However, even though we were to grant the genu- ineness of all of them, they prove nothing more than that the prophets were moving rapidly toward the position of Deutero- Isaiah, but none of them quite reached it, the nearest being Jeremiah. Scholars sometimes speak of an implicit monotheism with certain of the prophets before Deutero-Isaiah, but mono- theism had to be explicit before it could be implicit. Nowhere in his book does Albright mention the tradition that connects the bronze serpent of the wilderness with Moses. It is by no means certain that this tradition has any basis in fact,40 but it is as well attested as other traditions connected with Moses which Albright accepts. The story (Num 21 4b-9) belongs to the JE document and is further supported by the reference 39 So also such a conservative scholar as the late Jacob Hoschander, The Priests and the Prophets, 1938, 53: "The only proponent of a rigid Monotheism was the unknown exilic prophet." 40 The story is usually interpreted as etiological, but Albright himself has shown (pp. 38 f., 209 f., 293, 316) that the etiological argument can easily be overdone. 39</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE in 2 Ki 18 4. The striking fact about the bronze serpent of the story and the other stories connecting Moses with the serpent4' is that they reflect as dynamistic a conception as any cited by Albright (pp. 124 ff.) for the most primitive form of religion, and that assuredly does not favor a monotheistic religion for Moses. Neither does the statement in 2 Ki 18 4 that a bronze serpent made by Moses was worshipped right down to the time of Hezekiah. An important argument used by Albright for the appearance of monotheism with Moses is his interpretation of Hebrew prophecy. In the first place he maintains (pp. 231 f.) that the current explanation of the word ndbht', "prophet," as "speaker, spokesman," is almost certainly false because the correct etymo- logical meaning of the word is rather "one who is called," as appears from the fact that this is the sense which the root nabi2 "almost always" has in Akkadian. That may be correct etymologically, but as A. B. Davidson pointed out many years ago,42 "Etymology is rarely a safe guide to the real meaning of words... Usage is the only safe guide." And Albright himself says the same thing on p. 18: "Actually, no competent lexicog- rapher in any language fixes the precise meaning of a woid by its etymology but rather by collecting as many passages where the word occurs as possible or practical and by listing all mean- ings and shades of meanings in them. Words change their mean- ing through use to such an extent that the etymological method of fixing significance is only employed as a last resort, when other evidence is inadequate." Hence we must check the etymology of the word ndbhf', "prophet," with its usage, and it so happens that there is one occurrence of the word which makes its mean- ing absolutely certain in Hebrew, viz., Ex 7 i, where Yahweh is represented as saying to Moses: "See, I make you a god to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your spokesman [your nabhV']"; cf. Ex 4 1: "He [Aaron] shall speak for you to the people; he shall be a mouthpiece for you, and you shall be a god to him." That is, a prophet was a spokesman, the mouthpiece 4 See, e.g., the present writer, op. cit., 120 ff. 4 The Theology of the Old Testament, 1904, 257. 40</page><page sequence="21">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL of someone else, usually God. And that meaning does not con- flict with the etymology of the word. The root nabg is not found in Hebrew, but it is found in Akkadian, where the usual mean- ing is "to call," but it has also the meaning "to call out, to speak." Hence the current interpretation of "prophet" is vindi- cated by both usage and etymology, and Albright himself calls the prophets preachers in the Epilogue of his book (p. 309). More important, however, than Albright's derivation of the word "prophet" is his interpretation of the prophet's mission (pp. 86, 230 ff.). To him, as to most scholars, the prophets were reformers, but by this he means one who stripped Yahwism of its Canaanite accretions and restored it to its pristine purity. That is, the prophets were revivors of the old Mosaic religion and in no sense innovators. They had nothing whatever to do with initiating monotheism or anything else in Yahwism; they simply revived the old. This surely is a low estimate of the prophets, but it agrees with Albright's view expressed on p. 309 that Mosaism did not change in fundamentals from the time of Moses until the time of Christ. He compares the reformatory work of the prophets to the Protestant reformation in Christian- ity and the Wahhabi movement in Islam (p. 86). It is true that the Protestant reformers thought that they were restoring the original form of Christianity, even as Abd al-Wahhab thought that he was restoring the original religion of Muhammad, but every historian knows that neither the one nor the other did anything of the sort. They simply established what they thought was the original religion. It is also true, as Albright notes (pp. 241 ff.), that most of the nations of the Near East in the time of the later prophets were looking back with nostalgia upon their more glorious past and were trying to revive it by imitating such things as the ancient script and language (which was nothing but sympathetic magic), but again we have to note, as Albright does in the case of the script and language (pp. 46, 242), that their efforts were without notable success because of their defec- tive knowledge of the past. In a way the book of Deuteronomy represents a similar effort on the part of the Hebrews and it may represent, as Albright asserts (p. 244), "a conscious effort to recapture both the letter and the spirit of Mosaism which, 41</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE the Deuteronomists believed, had been neglected or forgotten by the Israelites of the Monarchy," but even Albright hardly dares to assert that they actually did recapture the letter and spirit of Mosaism, for he goes on to say (p. 244) that Deuter- onomy clearly follows the direction of development already marked out by J and E, and a little later (p. 245) he speaks of the "cult of Yahweh as reconstructed for the Mosaic age by the Deuter- onomic school." The Deuteronomists may have tried to recap- ture the original Mosaism, but after all it was only their idealized reconstruction that they produced. All peoples everywhere and in all times have idealized their past, and so did the Hebrew people. There is no question but that the prophets thought and professed that they were reviving the old religion of the past, but it was only their idealized reconstruction of that religion. This is apparent, among other things, from their claim that the ancient religion of Moses was without sacrificial rites of any kind. But one of the claims that Albright makes for Moses is that much of the sacrificial ritual must go back to him (pp. 192 f., 203 f.). If the prophets idealized the Mosaic religion with respect to its ritual, we have every reason to believe that they idealized it in other respects as well, and this is what scholars have long since maintained. More or less unconsciously the prophets read back into the past what they wanted for their own time, bolster- ing up their own ideas of what ought to be with the sanctity and authority that always belong to the past, a foir of argu- ment that is as old as man. Luther may possibly have thought that he was no innovator, but such he was, nevertheless, and so were the Hebrew prophets. Each made his contribution to the continuing stream of Hebrew religion and this stands out clearly as one reads their writings in chronological order. Indeed one cannot read Albright's account of them, each in turn, without feeling the onward movement of the religion. The chapter head- ings of his book themselves proclaim this: Praeparatio; When Israel was a Child; Charisma and Catharsis; In the Fulness of Time. Albright's book is scholarly, instructive, provocative, and stimulating. It covers such a sweep of time, of peoples, and of topics that it could have been written by no other living scholar. 42</page><page sequence="23">MEEK: MONOTHEISM AND ISRAEL 43 It is a book that no student of the Near East can ignore. But despite all its merits, it has its defects. It is a strange compound of orthodoxy and liberalism, of old-time traditionalism and modern criticism. And, to the present writer at least, it has failed to substantiate its main thesis that Mosaism began as a monotheistic religion and did not change in fundamentals until the time of Christ (p. 309). This appraisal may perhaps be too severe, but the candid discussion of a great book ought to add at least a little to the ultimate solution of the problem. For after all it is only through differences and the exchange of ideas that real progress can ever be made.</page></plain_text>
