This article advocates a new theory of denoting, different from that already set forth in the author's Princijiles of Mathematics. A denoting phrase is such solely in virtue of its form, and may denote nothing, one definite object, or one of several objects ambiguously. The notion of the variable is here taken as fundamental; II C(x)" means a propositional function with an undetermined variable x, and the notion II C(x) is always true " is taken as ultimate and indefinable. " C(everything) " then means "I C(x) is always true," "I C(nothing)" means II I C(x) is false' is always true," and "I C(something) " means "It is false that I C(x) is false' is always true," or, more briefly, II C(x) is not always true." By means of these formulas, denoting phrases can always be eliminated from any proposition in which they occur; they are not, as such, integral parts of the proposition, and never have any meaning in themselves, but every proposition in which they occur has a meaning. Out of any proposition we can make a denoting phrase, which denotes an entity if the proposition is true, but not if the proposition is false. Meinong's theory is objection- able because it infringes the law of contradiction. In Frege's theory the relation of the meaning to the denotation of the phrase is artificial and unsatisfactory; the two either become hopelessly separated, or else coin- cide without distinction. In conclusion, the author examines certain familiar logical puzzles, which for other theories of denotation present an inextricable tangle, but which seem to be satisfactorily solved by the theory here explained. F. D. MITCHELL. 346</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 347 La conscience et ses degrhs. P. SOLLIER. Rev. Ph., XXX, IO, PP. 329- 354. There are several reasons why a scientific study of consciousness is diffi- cult. The first reason is that the psychological and the philosophical aspects of the question have not been clearly distinguished. A second difficulty is the lack of an adequate definition of consciousness. A third disturbing factor is the failure to distinguish between consciousness of 'self' and brute consciousness, which does not involve the feeling of personality. The improper application of the epithet 'unconscious' to certain phenomena, as reflex and automatic acts, which are rather aspects of ' latent consciousness,' is a fourth source of confusion. The fifth and greatest difficulty is the absence of an objective criterion of consciousness. To meet the second difficulty, every phenomenon must be considered as conscious which we know to be perceived or produced by us or in us at the very moment at which it is perceived or produced. And though there is no objective criterion of consciousness, an indirect one may be found in the knowledge given us by the subject himself concerning what he thinks or does at the very moment. In the discussion of the degrees of conscious- ness, we look first for its beginning. Both in the evolution of the race and in that of the individual its appearance is hypothetical. So we are restricted to a consideration of its relation to cerebral activity. Here we are led to conclude that consciousness is a product of evolution, and that its various degrees are conditioned by the divers degrees of cerebral activity, the gradations varying either with the intensity of the excita- tion or with the rapidity of the nervous processes. And so consciousness, arising thus gradually in the evolution of the cerebral physiological proc- esses, varies with the states and conditions of these processes rather than with the intensity of disintegration, as was assumed by Herzen. The processes that give rise to consciousness seem to converge in Wundt's centre of apperception. However, consciousness is itself independent of cerebral energy, though its greater or less clearness is a function of this energy. But it is not an autonomous faculty; rather is it a fact of experi- ence developing by degrees with an organic evolution, its role being to deal with impressions received by the brain. G. W. CUNNINGHAM. Was kbnnen wir heute aus Schiller gewinnen ? RUDOLF EUCKEN. Kant- studien, X, 3, pp. 253-260. The unexampled progress in outward things which has been achieved in the century since Schiller's death has not been attended by an equal growth of the inward life, which indeed has become more perplexed and unsettled as the forces and interests without have increased in complexity and volume. There is manifest in many quarters an uncertainty about the content and meaning of human life, a lowering of spiritual energy at the centre with all the gain at the periphery; the spiritual life is not able to maintain itself</page><page sequence="3">348 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XV. against the opposing forces which have been created by the outward move- ment of civilization. As we become more clearly conscious of the dangers which threaten our deepest interests, we become sensible of the strength and inspiration we may gain from our poet for the solution of the problems which are seen to be of paramount importance. Schiller's whole life was one of concentrated energy; he was of all our poets a man of deeds, a man who did not drift with the stream of forces in which he found himself in- volved, but who met it with persistent effort at every point. It is this which in his dramatic productions forges into unity the wealth and variety of his material, which characterizes also his scientific writings where a few leading problems dominate and impart interest to the smallest details, in which also contrasts and opposition are clearly articulated and defined, so as to challenge the will at every point. But this formal aspect of Schiller's life is of no greater significance to us than its content. In the course of the century, our interests have become more and more anthropocentric. But a peculiar confusion and contradiction has made itself felt in this new field. For zest and efficiency of life there is necessary a happy faith in the significance and dignity of humanity; but this threatens to vanish before our increasing knowledge of man's place in the natural universe, and of the littleness which characterizes his dealings with his fellows. Now no one has accorded man a higher plane than did Schiller, at the same time justi- fying his estimate by a philosophical theory of man's freedom and ration- ality. It is man in this higher, non-empirical, capacity who challenges our highest faith and optimism. In the moral sphere, particularly, where, with all the hopeful dissatisfaction with present achievements, there is felt an impotence to transcend the opposition between the one and the many, the individual and society, and in the aesthetic striving, so general in our time, Schiller's wisdom and high example may serve as our guiding star and inspiration. EMIL C. WILM. Schillers /ransscendentaler Idealismus. W. WINDELBAND. Kantstudien, X, 3, pp. 398-41 I. The significance of Schiller's philosophical studies for his personal de- velopment is pretty definitely ascertainable and fairly well understood, as is also his importance in the popularization of the Critical Philosophy among the German speaking people. But as to what Schiller meant for philosophy, what part he had in the further development and the trans- formation of Critical Idealism, there seems as yet to be no general agree- ment. One thing must be kept distinctly in mind in the discussion of the relation of any of the disciples of Kant to the master, and that is that the Critical Philosophy was no hard and fast system whose underlying prin- ciples were not capable of any further development in one direction or another; the whole course of German Idealism may, indeed, be regarded as only a development of the rational system founded by Kant, and whether we regard any thinker as a Kantian or not will depend upon whether we</page><page sequence="4">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 349 have in mind the general position of the thinker in question, or emphasize the particular detail or specific issue which he may have developed beyond the immediate intention of the master. The transformation of the world into objects of consciousness is the decisive step of the Critical Philosophy, and this Schiller understood as fully and accepted as unreservedly as did Fichte. It was this fundamental note to which all the philosophical activity of Schiller was attuned. But what, precisely, this consciousness is, for which only objects had existence, whether it is individual consciousness, the consciousness of the race, or consciousness as such (Bewusstsein iiber- hauft), is a question which admits a variety of answers, and the particular shade the resulting idealistic system will take on will depend upon whether one or the other of these interpretations be given. If individual conscious- ness is emphasized, the idea of personality will come into the foreground, and the autonomy of the will, the self-determination of conduct and life, will appear as the ideals of the spirit which recognizes no values other than those of its own creation. It is this proud philosophy of individuality which constitutes perhaps the most significant of the personal motives in the phi- losophy of Kant, and which found the most hearty reception among his followers. No word, said Schiller, has ever been uttered by mortal man more significant than this, ' Determine thyself,' and this he declared to be the whole message of his own philosophy. It is because the form, the beautiful appearance (Schein), is man's own creation that he can move in the world of beauty with the perfect freedom of a sovereign. How far Schiller was removed from the boundless subjectivism to which these views might seem to lead is nowhere shown more clearly than in his efforts in the Kallias Briefe to fix upon the objective concept of the beautiful. It is just here that Schiller takes up an independent attitude toward Kant, who was concerned only with the purely transcendental problem of the possibility of synthetic judgments a firiori in the aesthetic realm. But in this he was not turning his back upon the Critical Philosophy, but was espousing it in its completest form. For beauty as freedom-in-the-appearance, the autonomy which must be an objective characteristic of things because it remains although the (individual) subject is not there to perceive it, is intelligible only if the phenomena with the objective marks of the beautiful upon them are already thought of as objects of consciousness as such. Schillerwas never closer to the highest development of Transcendental Idealism than in this attempt to fix upon an objective definition of the beautiful. The fuller development of these ideas, however, he left to the systematizers, turning his own attention from these metaphysical considerations to the anthro- pological problem of showing the intimate, organic, relation between rational values, ethical and aesthetical particularly, values which Kant, in the purity of the critical process, had left more or less separated from each other.

Eternal truths are generally regarded as pure hypotheses, a special neces- sity, or a personal convenience. There is, however, another line of ap- proach, the investigation of our immediate experiences of the meanings expressed in the so-called 'eternal truths.' Is the quality of eternality given or derived, a peculiarity of immediate experience or of reflective constructions ? It is important to make a distinction between eternal and timeless. The first means 'having unlimited duration' ; the second, ' having nothing to do with time.' In any experience moment we have meanings of the sensational order which are timeless in the strictest sense of this word. The same may be found in reproduction; the persistence of a quality in mental life is not colored by any temporal qualities in connec- tion with which it may have occurred. Also these may be shifted, as meanings, from one complex to another, without affecting their significant identity. Passing to those experiences containing meanings which in retro- spect are called ' eternal truths,' we hold that here, too, it is not all a matter of reflection. In each case the same unitary meaning is expressed. The conclusion seems to be, that we do gain the mastery over our world of meanings by the simple device of meaning the something and trusting to its own efficiency to carry us through. The ultimate practicability of any- thing is its ability to be referred to as an identical meaning. MATTIE ALEXANDER MARTIN. The Postulate of Immediate Emj5iricism. JOHN DEWEY. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., II, I5, pp. 393-399. The postulate of immediate empiricism is that things are what they are experienced as. Knowing is one mode of experiencing; the philosophic demand is to find out what sort of an experience knowing is. It is a mis- take to assume that, since things are what they are known to be from the knowledge experience, therefore, metaphysically, everything in its reality is what a knower would find it to be. A noise is frightful to me in one experience moment. In another it lacks this element, for, in this experi- ence, another thing is known and I realize that what was fearful in the first is changed to something innocent. There is a distinction between a thing as cognitive and as cognized. The fright above was cognitive; in a later experience it may or may not be cognized. An experience of lines as con- vergent when they are truly parallel, does not make the experience any the less that experience. The question of truth is not as to what is experi- enced, but as to the worth of that experienced thing. Because this is a concrete ' that,' it later can be developed into a corrected experience. No philosophical proposition can be deduced from the postulate of empiricism, but rather a method of philosophical analysis.

Rev., XIII, 2, pp. 6i-Si. In a recent address, G. H. Darwin distinguishes two fundamental scien- tific procedures: the study of the scientific phenomenon as a complex of elements, and the study of it as related to its environment. The object of this paper is to show that a combination of these two procedures, the struc- tural and the functional, is possible in psychology. Let the basal fact of psychology be conceived as a conscious self, the plain man's self which is realized, implicitly and not reflectively, as fundamental to the perceptions and ideas of the moment, and as related to its environment. This choice of the conscious self rather than the psychic event or idea as the basal fact of psychology is justifiable for two reasons. First, as recognized directly by Lipps, indirectly by other psychologists, the idea is an abstraction which invariably implies a self. There is no consciousness which is not self-con- sciousness. Secondly, the conscious experiences of a related self are not adequately to be described in terms of the succession of its own ideas. This ' self-psychology' harmonizes the essential features of both structural and functional psychology. It rejects the unjustifiable doctrine of the structural psychologist that the idea is the immediately observed, basal psychic phenomenon, and the equally erroneous assumptions of one group of functional psychologists that the psycho-physical self is the basal unit. It retains both the functional doctrine of the inherent relatedness of the self to the environment, and the analytic procedure which is the cardinal fea- ture of both methods, maintaining that structural and functional analyses are mutually supplementary. It makes room also for the subordinate tasks of the two methods: the relation of mental complexes to the physical or physiological, and the description of psychic content as promoting efficiency or giving meaning. In further support of reconciliation of the two methods, it is urged that certain actual experiences, such as perception and- imagina- tion, emotions and the experience of activity, can be adequately differen- tiated only in terms both of structure and of basal personal relations. ELSIE MURRAY. Aphasia. A. MEYER. Psych. Bul., II, 8, pp. 26I-277. In Der afihasische Symj5tomencomfilex, Wernicke brings the available data of aphasia to bear on the problem of psycho-physical elements, sub- jecting the possibility of separate reading and writing centres to searching criticism. His central issues are the intimate functional relation of spoken and written languages, and the significance of the ' word-notion.' The facts of aphasia, he maintains, are readily explicable by reference to two word centres (auditory and motor) and their connections, these constitut- ing the physical basis of the ' word-notion' or ' word-concept.' This ' word- notion' arises from the acquisition of the appreciation of sound and its sense, and of word utterance, the amalgamation of the three forming a</page><page sequence="7">352 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XV. functional complex. As to the actual make-up and localization of the substratum of this complex, W. is ambiguous, and the value of his schema of elements seems dubious. His classification of the clinical types is clear and definite. Aphasias may be classed as cortical, subcortical, transcort- ical, or conductive, according as the symptoms indicate lesions of cortical centres, of projection systems, of connections between word centres and the concept region, or between hearing and utterance centres. Partial defects in motor or sensory aphasia are ignored in this classification, and the term 'word-notion ' is accorded varying interpretations. W. next attacks the problem of the occasional occurrence of isolated agraphia or alexia, and of the warrant this affords for the assumption of special reading or writing centres. Written language is acquired late, and is therefore not provided with a uniform brain mechanism, as is speech. Being merely spelled language, it is a transcortical function subordinated to the centers of speech, dependent on the integrity of the word concept, and in turn the best criterion of this integrity. In the main, disorders of written language run parallel to those of spoken. Motor execution is not, however, roused directly by the concept mechanism, as in the case of speech, but through the mediation of the optic memory of letters, i. e., through a visual letter centre. The facts of pathology refute, not merely unilateral localization of this center, but any narrow localization of it whatsoever within the visual sphere. Isolated simple alexia, or word blindness, and pure isolated agra- phia appear to be subcortical in origin. The rare cases of isolated literal agraphia would seem to be analogous to conduction aphasia. In con- clusion, the study of asymbolia and apraxia, and the work of Storch promise to do away with much of the brain-cell mythology with which aphasia is afflicted, and with the hazy dogmatism about the relation of concept and word. ELSIE MURRAY. La fsychologie de IZargot. R. DE LA GRASSERI. Rev. Ph., XXX, 9, pp. 260-290. The writer discusses the origin of upper and lower class modes of speech in France, and then begins an analysis of the psychological elements of lower class slang. He distinguishes three classes of slang. The bourgeois jargon employs words found in no dictionary, but full of color, movement, and relief; popular slang is often coarse, but free and honest and full of images; the slang of the criminal has been formed as a means of self-pro- tection and has a sinister picturesqueness. One of the most apparent needs of slang is that of a group sign hidden from strangers and inferiors. This satisfies three instincts, that of cryptology, that of least effort, and the de- sire for greater union among members of the same group. Another need of slang is the need of the uncultivated mind for the concrete and material, and the need of a people to express its energy by the force of imagery. Related to these is the tendency to express through slang the qualities of a thing for the thing itself. Archaisms indicate a conservative love of the</page><page sequence="8">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 353 past; anthropomorphism, a necessity to draw nearer to the world of animals and things. Elliptic slang serves the desire for brevity, as well as the de- sire to express intimacy, suggested rapport between two speakers. Then there is the jealous desire to abase the unattainable which expresses itself in coarse slang; the kindred desire to belittle the superior through ironical slang; and a- more honest contempt for the fastidiousness of the refined, with its appropriate slang. On the other hand, there is euphemistic slang springing from an instinct of decency. The writer continues the further analysis, giving abundant illustrations. C. WEST. Les klkments affectifs du Ianggage: ses rappforts avec les tendances de la fsychologie moderne. C. Bos. Rev. Ph., XXX, IO, PP. 355-373. The coming period of psychology may be styled 'psychological,' in distinction from early periods of psychological thought and from that char- acterized by Comte the ' scientific period.' The latter was a period of analysis; this a period of synthesis. The coming period is a reaction against this intellectualism, this tendency to divide, classify, evaluate. The former period was quantitative; this may be called qualitative. This de- velopment corresponds to the history of the individual. Such are the three moments: primitive indetermination, their artificial divisions, and finally, a return to a synthetic unity. We wish to show to-day that language is such a unity. Wagner holds that language and music have the same source, that they are the issue of a primitive natural melody. This serves to explain the intimate relations between one's tone of voice and his vocabulary; the former expresses what the mere word alone could not. After the forma- tion of words, around them begin to cluster associations, a ' fringe.' Again, an individual, finding a language unsuited to his needs, changes the signification of words and gives to them his own affective tone. This sug- gests the possibility of a choice of a language being allowed a child in the school: if there is between an individual and a language a certain affinity, might this not be allowed to develop? When a stranger learns a new language, it is not until he has a feeling for it that he can be trusted to use the right word; the logically correct may be at the same time the offen- sive. The possibility of a universal language, except for technical pur- poses, seems distant, in view of the different affective values of different languages, values which translation eliminates. Even in one's own lan- guage, it is oftentimes only by a sort of ' symbolic knowledge' that words convey the meaning intended; the hearer must have this sentiment of anal- ogy in order that he may understand.

The recent treatment of religion is both historical and psychological, and may be called a treatment ' from below.' Although this has become an</page><page sequence="9">354 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XV. independent science, and is a natural outcome of the change from the idealistic to the naturalistic movement in the nineteenth century, yet it is by no means complete, and must be subjected to a critique. Now the realism or naturalism of the past century has tended to depreciate, or even remove entirely the value of religion. Natural science traces the evolution of the whole universe from its original elements according to universal natural laws, and shows how for a comparatively short period life has ap- peared on this earth. During this period man as a self-conscious creature has developed, who is able to reflect all reality in himself, thus forming the realm of thought as opposed to that of matter. The third stage is seen in the communion of these thinking individuals in society and culture life, forming the state, morality, art, science, religion, etc. But as the earth cools, all this conscious life will pass away, and thus for natural science such temporary mental activity is but a secondary product of the cosmic process, and not a special and independent reality. Looking now at this treatment ' from below' more in particular, we find that the method gained its power from the extension of the genetic phase into the doctrine of evo- lution. Biology, using the analytic-synthetic method of chemistry and physics, came to seek not only the elementary substances and processes, but also the first, second, etc., and to inquire how present processes arose; and further, this investigation became phylogenetic as well as ontogenetic. We then have protoplasm and cells corresponding to atoms and molecules of physics and chemistry, and the so-called laws of evolution. This shows more completely still that all higher organisms are nothing new, but merely a secondary product of the first and original elements. The so-called prin- ciple of ' life force' is only a fiction; by the genetic biological method all such principles are derived from the elementary factors. When we turn to mental life more in particular, it may be observed that, while it is not reducible to material processes, yet it is dependent on them. Certain phys- iological processes are accompanied by sensations and feelings, out of which elements all mental life is composed. These elements also are treated ontogenetically and phylogenetically, giving rise to individual and social or 'folk' psychology. Further, since these psychical processes depend on physical processes, the fundamental treatment 'from below' remains biological, and the psychological functions are merely a higher means for biological existence. In social existence the biological-psycho- logical processes only become more complex. The consequences of this treatment are obvious. Moral and religious life loses its ground and con- tent; all the unity of culture life is denied. We find, however, as a striking fact, the existence of moral and religious ideals; society proceeds as if mental life were original and independent. In order, then, to prevail, the treatment ' from below' must explain these phenomena by its own princi- ples. And this may, perhaps, be done. In regard to the seeming inde- pendence of mental life, Eucken offers a solution in his idea of the ' isolation of consciousness.' The secondary psychical processes turn in upon them-</page><page sequence="10">No. 3.] SUMWMARIES OF ARTICLES. 355 selves and lose their original connections; they become isolated and inde- pendent powers. The unity and altruism of society may also be explained as more highly complex stages of the struggle of the individual for existence, and nothing in themselves independent of biological principles. Under this treatment, then, all so-called independent reality is reduced to that which aids adaptation in phylogenetic development; truth is merely the best and most complete adaptation. R. B. WAUGH. Die Gliederung der Gesel/schafi bei Schilermacher, ein Beistiiel dergenet- isch-konstruktiven Klassifikations-methode. GERHARD STOSCH. V. f. w. Ph., XXIX, i, pp. 67-I IO. This article is a summary of Schleiermacher's theory of the origin of the various forms in which the social life of mankind is organized. These forms are the products of the ethical process, which is defined as a taking- up of the merely natural into the life of reason. This activity of reason has two functions. On the one hand, it organizes natural data; on the other, the products of this organization become symbols, or manifestations, of this rational activity. In this primary meaning of the terms, the two functions coincide. But the writer points out that, in the last resort, it is the consciousness which is developed in the course of this activity which is the real symbol of reason, and the symbolizing function of reason is that which has to do with this development. Rational activity has also two characters: that in which it is common to all agents, the objective, ana- lytic, and scientific; and that in which it is peculiar to the individual, the subjective, affective, aesthetic, synthetic, and religious. As each of these functions appears under both characters, we have four chief forms of social activity: the state, free sociability, the academy, and the church. A statement of the origin and nature of each is given, based chiefly on the various revisions of the ethical writings. The writer's conclusion is that Schleiermacher's classification of the social forms is, in the terminology of Wundt, genetically constructive, but not genetically reconstructive. Their evolution is described, but they are defined on the basis of a preconceived notion. The characters and functions of reason are also established specu- latively rather than empirically. Nevertheless, at various points empirical observation guided and supplemented the speculative construction, so that much is empirically true for which a valid speculative deduction is lacking. This is especially true of the place given to individuality. And, though Schleiermacher's method may be antiquated, his chief ideas are of perma- nent value to social science, which needs the unifying influence of such a broad outline. EDMUND H. HOLLANDS.</page><page sequence="11">356 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XV. Les rafifiorts de 1' hisloire et de la science sociale d' atires Cournol. C. BOUGLP: Rev. de M6t., XIII, 3, pp. 349-376. Cournot is par excellence the theorist of chance. History, he claims, is made by accidents; order does not become sensible except through dis- order. Representing the chain of causes producing a phenomenon by a line, the result of the intersection of that line by another such line is chance, i. e., the meeting of two series of causes. But Cournot is far from thinking history a record of coincidences. The work of the historian is not only to separate the accidental from the necessary, but to show the im- portance of each; to show in which cases the two intercepting series are really independent, and in which derived from the same system; to note which of their causes are passing and which remain. If incidents have far-reaching effects, it is because they fall in with forces more profound. He should discern by what slow evolution the abrupt catastrophe is pre- pared and be able to calculate what this evolution would have accom- plished without the catastrophe. There are cases where the issue is only a matter of time; the balance of forces are in its favor; incidents can only accelerate or retard it. In other more undecided cases, a large margin is left to chance. Whether there is law or no law in history, there are always facts to be subordinated to other facts. And it is to be hoped the his- torian will also formulate empirical laws. In reality, living bodies and social bodies are subject to the same laws of organization. But Cournot shows that the role of the mechanical more and more overshadows the role of the organic, and custom becomes code. So the economist's point of view prevails. With the triumph of the mechanical over the organic will come the triumph of the universal over the particular, the permanent over the ephemeral. Does not nature tend to stability in disembarrassing herself successively of accidental causes of disorder ? It is between the two ex- tremes of development that superior men exercise the greatest influence on their times and that the strokes of fortune fall with the greatest force. It is this stage that makes history. All history is an increase and a decrease. A people gains freedom through courage and frugality, and loses this cour- age through the self-indulgence bred of the fruits of victory. The power created in order to expel an enemy, becomes through the pride of that very victory a menace. The ardor with which a nation carries out an enterprise is followed by lassitude and inability to meet a new set of conditions. An empire having been formed by the absorption of little states, the inconven- ience of centralization is felt and decentralization begins. One should seek to find the conditions which normally would permit the establishment of such and such an institution, or insure the success of such an idea. There should be tables of equivalents and values. Cournot claims not only the possibility, but the necessity of organizing the social sciences. C. WEST.</page><page sequence="12">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 357 Evolution and Ethical Method. H. W. WRIGHT. Int. J. E., XVI, i, PP- 59-67. The aim of this article is to suggest an interpretation of morality which makes full use of the illuminating concept of evolution, without having recourse to those biological principles and analogies which are inapplicable to the field of ethics. The field of conduct is coextensive with the sphere of intelligent or purposive activity. Purposive activity is an organizing process, inasmuch as it is continually integrating new objects and elements into the complex unity of personal character. The end of this organizing process, as revealed in moral experience, is the complete adjustment of the individual into the social system. That this end, the goal of moral evolu- tion, may be attained, certain forms of activity must be put forth by the individual. These forms of purposive action, which are required as steps in moral evolution, are hence seen to possess necessity. Such are the several virtues which have acquired authority in moral development. Thus, in order to distinguish these virtues, we look for different forms of purposive activity which are necessary stages in moral evolution. All purposive ac- tivity has the negative aspect of do'erentiatzon in the introduction of new ends into the life of the individual, and the positive aspect of integration in the attainment of these ends. We may distinguish three general forms of purposive action, which are necessary stages in moral development: (I) That in which the single impulse is gratified; (2) that in which total individual welfare is pursued in distinction from the single object of desire. This activity involves, on its negative side, Temperance, on its positive, Pru- dence. (3) That in which the welfare of society is promoted in distinction from narrower individual interest, involving negatively Justice, and posi- tively Benevolence. H. W. WRIGHT.</page></plain_text>
