<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theatrical Shakespearegresses at the Guthrie and Elsewhere: Notes on "Legitimate Production" Thomas Clayton T HHIS ESSAY BEGAN as a response to a complex challenge issued in a call for papers on Shakespeare's plays that "should in- vestigate the subject of contemporary productions: do such non-traditional approaches"-with Ariel as an "androgynous punk," for example-"enhance the characters, the text, the beauty, the point of the plays, or have some directors distorted the plays in making them more accessible to wider audiences?"' The question is appropri- ately ambiguous, because the answer is, I think, "both." And M. H. Abrams's classic coordinates in The Mirror and the Lamp seem to me pertinent for the purpose: first, the artist (playwright, director, de- signer, and so forth); second, the audience(s); third, the "workitself"; and an implicit fourth, the "world." Equally pertinent are such ques- tions as what, where, and when is a play? Is it in the conception and composition of the playwright? So most have thought, more or less, some emphasizing the playwright and others the conception and composition. In the eyes, mind, and viscera of the beholder? So most have been bound also to think, from ordinary spectators to reception theorists. In some kind of mimetic relationship between the play and the phenomenal world? "Probably," somehow, by common consent if not by the consent of solipsists and language prison-housekeepers. Or, with particular reference to theater, is it in the performance and/ or the eyes of the director and company? Also yes, notwithstanding Aristotle, who may have been right in theory about the distance be- tween "spectacle" (i.e., performance) and dramatic art (i.e., script) but who did not foreclose upon the actualities of aesthetic and theatrical Realpolitik, where all definitions and evaluations have their practical essence and descent. There, I take it, is a primary rub. These issues have of course been persistently controverted. Two pertinent recent discussions taking opposed positions in effect are those of Charles Marowitz in his Introduction to The Marowitz Shake- speare, and Alan C. Dessen in "Shakespeare's Scripts and the Modern Director."2 Dessen's position is that there is "much virtue in the orig- inal conventions and the original logic of presentation," and that we</page><page sequence="2">NEW LI 1ERARY HIS I OKY should "really trust Shakespeare's know how and skills to the extent that we feel a responsibility to discover and recover his techniques and meanings" (64, italics his), a partly archaeological project. Marowitz, introducing his "Adaptations and Collages" of Hamlet, Macbeth, The Taming of the Shrew, Measure for Measure, and The Merchant of Venice, proceeds from the position that the question is not, as it is so often put, what is wrong with Shakespeare that we have to meddle with his works, but what is wrong with us that we are content to endure the diminishing returns of conventional dramatic reitera- tion; that we are prepared to go to the theatre and pretend that what dulls our minds and comforts our world-view is, by dint of such reassurances, cul- turally uplifting; not to realise that there is nothing so insidious as art that perpetuates the illusion that some kind of eternal truth is enshrined in a time-space continuum called a "classic"; not to challenge the notion that its theatrical performance is automatically an experience because our presump- tion of a play's established worth guarantees us this experience. We all dupe ourselves in the theatre because we have been sold a bill of goods for a quarter of a century before we enter. (25) Dessen speaks temperately for a species of scholarly respect for the "original" meanings and techniques; Marowitz's reconstructive icono- clasm is characteristically impatient. There is something to be said for both positions, but Marowitz's position is paradoxically easier to de- fend, because it is concerned not primarily with reproducing Shake- speare but ultimately with adapting, in effect replacing, Shakespeare, as in his own collages, a species of creation in which Shakespeare's script is both assumed and subsumed in a work substantially and for- mally not of his making. Although Marowitz advocates replacing An- cients with Moderns, defense of adaptation does not entail categorical rejection of "the classics," and the case for new works is self-made regardless of their sources, even without invoking Ulysses' ironical analysis in Troilus and Cressida: One touch of nature makes the whole world kin, That all with one consent praise new-born gawds, Though they are made and moulded of things past, And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt o'er-dusted. The present eye praises the present object.... (3.3.175-80) Perhaps there never was such an entity as "the play itself," even more than there no longer is "the poem itself," because outside of 512</page><page sequence="3">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES closet drama the play does not exist, except hypothetically and poten- tially, short of performance and audience reception: those are the ends-the final cause-of the script. Thus the latter are easily, or perhaps facilely, granted autonomy and permitted to be what they will-that is, as director and audience will have them. In such cases the script may be all but irrelevant, a mere source of boundless per- formance, while the latter is what counts-as suggested by the stage direction of Ionesco's Macbett for the opening dialogue between Gla- miss and Candor: "the text serves only as a basis for their mounting anger."3 Directors' "distortions" are otherwise, because distortion itself im- plies a systematic relationship between the intermediation-the di- rector's designs and the performances-and the script interme- diated. In fact, among the few alternatives to a systematic relation- ship between script and production are psychodrama, the happening, and Living Theater, a form of histrionic activity involving collective and extemporaneous interaction between actors and audi- ence that was especially prominent in the late sixties. In such cases, whatever scenario there may be soon dissolves into spontaneous and autonomous activity, the collective theatrical equivalent of stream of consciousness. John Russell Brown notes of performing act three, scene one of Hamlet that "the action of this scene, the bearing, move- ments and gestures of its two figures," Hamlet and Ophelia, "can give Shakespeare's words almost opposite effects. Which is the more 'true' depends on how the whole play has been brought alive in continuous relationship to Shakespeare's text,"4 however few or many are re- sponsible for the relationship and whatever its principles of coher- ence. Script and performance may perhaps best be seen as different manifestations of the same dramatic work, visible from many angles but beyond comprehending, at any rate beholding, as a whole. In formal production "enhancement" and "distortion" are not strict antitheses; in fact, in some relations distortion effects enhance- ment. But they do correspond with positive and negative value judg- ments, and for most practical purposes those are all that matter. A script is "enhanced" when its performance accomplishes the ends of those primarily and immediately concerned, namely, the persons of the theater on and behind the stage, and the persons of the theater in front of or around the stage, the audience. Whether it has been "dis- torted" is a critical or sociopolitical enquiry, very often both, since the two can hardly be disjoined, as some contemporary critics never tire of reminding us. And any academic critic in his or her very real social and economic worlds is bound to recognize the practical if not the theoretical force of both of these. What matters in a primary critical perspective-one that is not vo- 513</page><page sequence="4">NEW LITERARY HISTORY cationally a reviewer's, a theater person's, or a politico's-is not a production's realizing the originality and inventiveness of the di- rector and company, or causing the generalized excitement or bore- dom of the audience during or at the end of a given performance. It is rather the relationship, the fit, of the performance with the script in terms of what the script can properly yield from its own text(s) and its contexts. "Properly" may seem unusual in present usage, but it points up an important distinction. Translators use proper-some- times misleadingly-for two different but related ideas in Aristotle's Greek, to prepon (what is appropriate, fitting, proportionate, seemly) and idios (one's own, integral, distinctive, peculiar). The distinction helps to clarify differences between what "belongs to" a script and what is appropriate or necessary for an audience. A script so remote from an audience's experience as to be scarcely intelligible, however lucid and distinguished in its own terms and for its specificity, would demand "distortion" to become comprehensible in popular presenta- tion (academic study of the "same" play is a different matter). When works of any kind are remote from prospective users, something has to be done to one or the other, or both, to reduce the distance: by educating the audience or translating the work. Translation is a form of distortion, and cultural "translation" is sometimes no less necessary than linguistic translation. Educating the audience is itself a form of translation, and it can be accomplished by the theater as well as by external preparation to understand the theater. A script's contexts include current history and the circumstances of performance, which are unavoidably part of its realizable potentiality as well as of its pressures for communication. A striking example of a script's communicating more of its potentialities than its performers intended, in an unpolemic production, is revealed in an anecdote of Ian McKellan given in John Barton's Playing Shakespeare: Let me tell you a story. In 1969 I played Richard II in a production which we took round England and then briefly to Europe and we went to Czecho- slovakia. The costumes were of the actual period of Richard II but the scenery was minimal because it was a touring production ... On the whole we concentrated on the humanity of the characters rather than their political nature. We thought of the political factions as a family, Richard II as a man with cousins and uncles and other relatives, and I think it was in that sense that we looked at the politics in it. However, we landed in Czechoslovakia only six months after the Prime Minister, Dubcek, had been removed by his neighbouring allies, the Russians. One result of this political change was that they didn't want visiting for- eigners with their plays. They tried to stop our visit, but it was too late.... We only played two nights and the houses were full, although all our posters 514</page><page sequence="5">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES had been pulled down. So perhaps the audiences were ready to see this visit as a special occasion and indeed a political occasion, in that we were coming from the West. When I came to the speech where Richard II returns from Ireland to dis- cover that his nation has been overrun by his cousin Bolingbroke, and he kneels down on the earth and asks the stones and the nettles and the insects to help him in his helpless state against the armies who had invaded his land, I could hear something I had never heard before, nor since, which was a whole audience apparently weeping. It shakes me now to think about it, be- cause in that instant I realised that the audience were crying for themselves. They recognized in Richard II their own predicament of only six months previously when their neighbours and as it were their cousins had invaded their land, and all they had were sticks and stones to throw at the tanks. I would never have talked about the play in those terms. We hadn't seen it as directly relevant to any modern political situation. Shakespeare couldn't have known about communism, about the East or the West. Afterwards I said to one of the new men, the anti-Dubcek faction, to one of their leaders who was in the audience, "Who did you side with in the play, Richard II or Bo- lingbroke? The man on the ground or the invader?" And he said, "Both right, both wrong."5 The response is one that Shakespeare arguably did "intend," in the sense that the causes of such emotional response are clearly in the play: Richard's love of country and deeply felt sense of loss entail sympathetic responses in an emotionally responsive audience. Ob- viously such a response is at odds with those aimed at by Brechtian alienation effects, which are, however, quasi-cathartic in seeking a particular effect, political consensus and programmatic action. That is partly where the question tends, "have some directors dis- torted the plays in making them more accessible to wider audiences?" -that is, more familiar and a la mode in relation to conventions of contemporary sound and spectacle, which may make the sense of the script even less accessible by the intermediation; it might or might not seem so, depending upon who is seeing Peter Brook's famous (and notorious) production of A Midsummer Night's Dream and what he or she brings to the performance by way of experience and expecta- tions. The same is true to a greater degree of a recent London mu- sical adaptation, The Dream, performed in a reggae-punk rock-and- roll idiom by the Hempen Homespuns with the bass player doubling as Bottom.6 No doubt such productions differ in their aesthetic orga- nization of demands and rewards, but both bring to the theater donnees as well as assumptions recognizable from their contexts of origin and conventional conditions of performance as circus, concert, disco, and so on. 515</page><page sequence="6">NEW LITERARY HISTORY II Even if strict "fidelity to the script and playwright" were desirable as such, it is impossible to achieve except in the immediate theatrical circumstances in which it originated and came to realization; it is dif- ficult even there, certainly in our own day as it probably was in Shakespeare's. As shareholder and active participant in productions as well as playwright, he must have had more of a controlling hand as well as interest in his plays and their playing than playwrights of our day ordinarily have, but he cannot have been much less subject to circumstances-the slings and arrows of audience, box office, fellow members of the company, rival playwrights, dark ladies, and Bank- side and Blackfriars socioeconomics generally. How complicated such issues may be, even when as relatively simple as this, is suggested by Tom Stoppard's Author's Note to Jumpers, a text of multiple applicability: In preparing previous plays for production I have tried with some difficulty to arrive at something called a 'definitive text', but I now believe that in the case of plays there is no such animal. Each production will throw up its own problems and very often the solution will lie in some minor change to the text.... What follows is a basic version of Jumpers.... POSTSCRIPT (February 1973): .. . [His spaced periods.] And indeed after some months' absence Jumpers returned to the National Theatre in a slightly altered form. This edition incorporates the changes because they seem to me an improvement on the original....7 Aristotle's advice to tragic playwrights applies equally well to the exi- gencies of production: "the example of good portrait-painters should be followed. They, while reproducing the distinctive form, make a likeness which is true to life and yet more beautiful."8 The acceptability of a production depends inescapably upon its so- cioeducational context. In volatile or early-revolutionary social cir- cumstances, anything goes-for a while; where "prohibition" or its counterparts prevail, not much passes muster: it is a long way from Reinhardt and Dieterle's Mendelssohnian Disney World Midsummer Night's Dream to Peter Brook's, not to mention the 1984 reggae-punk musical version of The Dream. The case of The Tempest's Ariel as "an- drogynous punk" seems roughly thus: "he/she" would probably of- fend sheltered audiences as outrage for the sake of outrage, which of course it might be by design for such audiences; an audience of "an- drogynous punks" would tend to find more ironical amusement than 516</page><page sequence="7">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES matter for offense or painful "self-recognition."9 At the performance I saw of The Dream, about a third of the audience-mostly the older third-disappeared at the interval; probably most of those who left had come for the Shakespeare and many of those who stayed had come for the music, but those who left apparently had a lower level of tolerance for the alarums and excursions, too, though plainly her- alded in advertisements and program. The major problem with all adaptations is that they are adaptations-restylings, translations, transformations-of old or otherwise alien scripts to new purposes and circumstances, hardly in itself a critical problem so long as the intention of adaptation is generally made clear as such. Charles Mar- owitz's position is flawless in this way. So are such proximate adapta- tions as John Barton's Wars of the Roses and Giorgio Strehler's Das Spiel der Mdchtigen, not least because "one can scarcely hope to mount the three parts of Henry VI in their entirety."0° And much the same is true of the Falstaff saga, enacted or referred to in five of Shake- speare's plays, that became Orson Welles's film Chimes at Midnight. But when production is claimed, those intimate with the script rightly object when adaptive uses made of the language and its contextual implications result in distortion, misrepresentation, and downright confusion by the confounding of primary intentions incorporate in the script. Three representative test cases from the Tyrone Guthrie Theater's repertoire in the late sixties and early seventies are a notorious Ba- nana Republic Julius Caesar, a Measure for Measure in nineteenth-cen- tury Viennese and Austro-Hungarian idiom, and a "conventional" Merchant of Venice. Julius Caesar was so generally condemned for persistent conflict be- tween the design and the dialogue that, when one of the styrofoam statues of Caesar caught fire during a performance, a critical act of God was suspected in some quarters. The Latin-American overlay- culture upon culture as well as costume over costume-virtually in- sures conflict and multiple confusion, and in that way failure of pro- duction. This was the case of a bright idea with severely limited ap- plication: analogy acknowledged, out goes the candle, and we-and the production-are left darkling. The contrast between the effect of this production, which strove for "relevance," and the "politically neutral" Richard II performed in Czechoslovakia is as striking as it is instructive: the relevance is in the text-action, character, dialogue, design; what is willfully imported, when no systematic relationship to the script is possible, suppresses or confuses what was already there, a case of substantial negative distortion. There was no problem in the congenial resetting of Measure for 517</page><page sequence="8">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Measure, which has no received and entrenched conception with en- tailed responses for a midwestern American audience-like many other "postmodern" audiences-to react to as such; and the doctrinal matter is unobjectionable in post-theological circumstances. The Austro-Hungarian uniforms and setting, after initially impressing, became subliminal. Especially interesting about this production was that "the play" ended differently on different nights. On most it ended on a note of temperate happiness, with the novice nun Isabella modestly but evidently pleased by the prospect of finding a new vo- cation in a marriage to the Duke, who had saved her from Angelo's hypocritical attempts to seduce her. On a few it ended ominously, with Isabella blocked in the same position, vis-a-vis the Duke, in which she had earlier confronted Angelo, now removing her wimple with an air of apprehension, as though the Duke himself were about to inflict marriage upon her in the sinister spirit of Angelo, with a strong hint of women perennially at the mercy of a dark "brother- hood" of exploiting men. To the extent that Shakespeare's tempted and fallen Angelo and the once remiss but self-reforming Duke are made to seem interchangeable, we have a counter-Gordian final solu- tion that forces the equating of dramatic antitheses, the would-be vil- lain with the must-be hero.11 The power of suggestive performance to achieve electrifying effect in this Measure could hardly be gainsaid, but that is a given: kinesiolo- gists have sufficiently demonstrated that body language speaks louder than words, as professional actors have always known; and, as a rule of bitten thumb, the more welcome or provocative the mes- sage, the more eloquent the gesture.12 But the question is not whether "the spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own" (in Aristotle's phrase), but whose senses take priority in a pro- duction, a question of ethics, politics, and economics as well as of aesthetics and semantics. A "supertext" that cannot count on the script for much countenance may find it readily enough in accept- ability to favorably disposed audiences and critics. What this amounts to is the power of the production values as such, or the congeniality of the overlay in itself, or both. Whether such playing falsifies the script is one question, answerable in the affirmative; whether playing and script should take a particular position is two other questions, to be answered in terms of what is seen as necessary or appropriate con- temporary satisfactions. From the Guthrie Measure for Measure to The Merchant of Venice was the distance from general acceptance to wholesale controversy, pro- voked by one of the local reviewers and outraged members of the public. This Merchant, despite a deftly balanced and complex Shylock, was the focal point of protracted debate, some but not most of it in 518</page><page sequence="9">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES the Jewish community and much of it arguing that the play is anti-Se- mitic in effect, despite acknowledged efforts made in this production to defuse the imputed anti-Semitism. So the question became whether Merchant should be allowed to be performed at all, as written. One answer, in the form of "found meaning," was offered first by Edmund Kean in 1814, elaborated by Sir Henry Irving (1879) and others, and employed recently by Jonathan Miller in his 1970 stage production and later film, with Lord Olivier as a sympathetic victim-hero Shylock. There is clearly an ethical and social case for this kind of treatment, founded on a need to counteract persisting anti- Semitism in the culture where the performance originates, but the script will not yield it without systematic distortion: gone from Miller's production, for example, was Shylock's self-characterizing so- liloquy beginning, How like a fawning publican he looks. I hate him for he is a Christian. But more, for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis, and brings down The rate of usance here with us [usurers] in Venice. (1.3.36-40) Whether rewriting The Merchant of Venice is even a particularly ef- fective-let alone otherwise justifiable-way is twice open to ques- tion, but Miller and many members of his audience answered with a resounding yes. The "success" had to rest not on production as such but on adaptation not identified as "Miller's (and Olivier's) Merchant of Venice," which in fact it is. Distinctions of this kind are matters of degree, no doubt, and edges will feather, but reversing the main thrust of a script is clearly different from producing it. No such furor attended the productions of The Merchant of Venice at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1981 and 1984, the first with a Shylock in general not unlike the Guthrie's, the second with a mostly unsympathetic figure, but neither a comic butt nor a Jew of Malta. All three productions operated well within the scope of tenable script-based production, and such usual reviewers' differ- ences as there were centered not on Shylock but on other aspects, particularly in the 1984 Royal Shakespeare Company Merchant, a production marred by the excesses of the designer, increasingly a second principal responsible for auteur production as the composer is coming to be a third through programmatic scoring.13 The Guthrie's Measure for Measure was given a feminist final turn, and Jonathan Miller's Merchant of Venice was reconstituted from the remains of Shakespeare's Merchant surviving amputation: not merely 519</page><page sequence="10">NEW LITERARY HISTORY epater la bourgeoisie but by social imperatives' dictating the terms of production, which entailed remaking Shakespeare. Though some so- ciohistorical critics tend to reduce Shakespeare to the countermea- sure of Ben Jonson's "he was not of an age, but for all time," Shake- speare is arguably a better tutor than his directors and critics, but he clearly needs interpreting for our own latterly historical eyes. And there is another rub: the academic and the theatrical interpreter, in- dividual or collective, are cut in part from the same cloth, and designs play a substantial part in the action, designs not only semantic and aesthetic. III In a Guthrie symposium on "Staging Shakespeare Today" held in connection with the 1982 production of As You Like It, there was about an even division between proponents of "conservative" and of "liberal" production-useless terms for specific applications, but suf- ficiently differential. The respective representation was perhaps a little surprising. On the liberal side were two academics, together with Michael Lupu, one of the dramaturgs and Director of Outreach at the Guthrie and a Rumanian like the director, Liviu Ciulei. On the conservative side were two actors-an Englishman David Warrilow, the Beckett specialist, who played Jacques, and Ken Ruta, who played the Dukes-together with a third academic, a sometime dramaturg, who inveighed against (Continental) "concept" production.14 The actors were such proponents of fidelity to the text that Samuel Johnson would have been at home in their company, as a typical En- lightenment spokesman for the well-heard play. "A dramatick exhibi- tion is a book recited with concomitants that encrease or diminish its effect," he wrote in 1765 in the Preface to his edition of Shakespeare; spectators come "to hear a certain number of lines recited with just ges- ture and elegant modulation" (my italics). Warrilow held that the text speaks best for itself, when allowed to, through cultivated articulation of the demonstrable sense and music of the words. It would be diffi- cult for a reader of Shakespeare not to agree, since interpreting what a text says is practically subject to as well as theoretically circum- scribed by the relative norms of the language(s) the text was written in. And intelligible production of a play is not less beholden to the script. Even if it is true that all texts cannot help but be misread if not mismapped in the reader's own way, there is a tacit social and moral obligation to try to read it accurately, if one purports to be represen- 520</page><page sequence="11">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES ting its sense as more or other than one's own. This obligation does not preclude doing anything one pleases with a text after it has been assigned the status of a point of departure and made the basis of an adaptation. Nahum Tate can no more be faulted than Charles Maro- witz for his confessed adaptations to the perceived needs or expecta- tions of his audience, but producers may reasonably be faulted who come close enough to reflect and nevertheless falsify their scripts simultaneously. But much depends upon the audience addressed. Those very fa- miliar with the canon, like substantial numbers in Royal Shakespeare Theatre audiences, can recognize departures and approve or disap- prove according to their lights. Those less familiar (like the ones ad- dressed by the BBC-Time/Life television series) are not unlikely to accept as Shakespeare's whatever they see, and understandably ascribe to the playwright idiosyncrasies originating elsewhere. If Timon of Athens is performed in Jacobean dress to stress the raging waste and conspicuous consumption of the court of James I, the play has been made emphatically a document of an age, and of an ide- ology to the extent that the tacit referent is the Rise of Capitalism, while the "universality" anchored in Shakespeare's Athenian setting is cut loose and cast adrift. If the Athenian setting designed by the playwright cannot convey the significance desired by a director, "re- storing" production to the period of composition is not likely to im- prove upon it, especially for a modern audience. Ron Daniels's imagi- native Timon and Richard Pasco's powerful Timon at The Other Place in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1981 achieved much of their effect by the production's spare "Athenian" setting as well as by proximity to the audience-all (Western) time and space as one, as it were. The reference of the dialogue is preserved in such a setting, whereas much may be made "problematic" by leaving the dialogue in place but not the setting when that matters as certainly as it does in the tragedies set in classical antiquity-not as dead museum pieces but as actions vital and enlightening as historic (or retrojected) archetypes. Greece and Rome remain foundations of archetypal reference in Western culture, and Shakespeare used them sparingly but deliber- ately; directors do well to think carefully before they abandon the moorings to look for new ones. Timon is a practical case in point, where abstract discussion of such issues as "fidelity to the text" leads mainly to synonymity (e.g., "loy- alty") and as often to obscurity. Many favor "correctness," but far from all agree on what correctness is, much less how to recognize it. The philosopher David Hume is still instructive in cases of this sort: 521</page><page sequence="12">NEW LITERARY HISTORY ... it is very difficult, if not impossible, to explain by words where the just medium lies between the excesses of simplicity and refinement, or to give any rule by which we can know precisely the bounds between the fault and the beauty. A critic may discourse not only very judiciously on this head without instructing his readers, but even without understanding the matter perfectly himself.... However dif- ferent the tastes of men, their general discourse on these subjects is com- monly the same. No criticism can be instructive which descends not to partic- ulars, and is not full of examples and illustrations. It is allowed on all hands that beauty, as well as virtue, always lies in a medium; but where this medium is placed is a great question, and can never be sufficiently explained by gen- eral reasonings.l1 Critics of production must eventually come to cases, and it is inevi- tably the principles and ends of re-creation and the particulars and means of re-production that determine the judgment. For another example take a recent Royal Shakespeare Company Twelfth Night (1983-84)16 as reviewed by Irving Wardle in The Times: Quite a deal of poison has been seeping into this play over the past few years, but John Caird's is the first I have seen that projects Twelfth Night as an all-out dark comedy. This is good news not only for jaded old spectators who have seen the piece too often. There is a limit to the amount of fun that can be extracted from the drinking scene and permutations of Malvolio's letter in a play that was never more than intermittently uproarious. And there is every- thing to be said for muting the comedy for once and giving full attention to the central matter of the illusions and frenzies of love.17 This review is revealing. It is no doubt a long way from here to The Revenger's Tragedy and what Vindice calls the "spendthrift veins of a dry duke, / A parched and juiceless luxur," but those "jaded old spec- tators" evidently need some new kicks-or even a touch of flogging -to get the cathartic juices flowing. And of course the "illusions and frenzies of love" are so much a fashion if not a fact of our time and place that they would be the "central matter" of Twelfth Night. Other phrases acknowledge the extraneous origin of the gathering gloom, the pressure for novelty ("for once"), and the presence of tacitly un- characteristic because only intermittent "uproariousness."'8 Compa- rable recent redactions of Twelfth Night, all three on the brighter side of this once "Joyous Comedy," are Ariane Mnouchkine's at Le Theatre du Soleil in Vincennes, Paris (1982-1984); a small-scale production by the Actors Touring Company, performed in the spring of 1984 in London in various fringe venues, including Fenton House garden; and Liviu Ciulei's at the Guthrie in October and November of 1984. All three were "Joyous" productions in which Feste was made the choice and master spirit, the "intermittent uproariousness" was al- 522</page><page sequence="13">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES lowed prominence, and Malvolio was the vain spoilsport and comic butt of the script (for most, but currently being controverted), not without shading or a measure of sympathy but with firmness: he was duly exorcised as he is in the script, for "thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges." Also enlightening in this perspective are a pair of West Indies-set productions with all-black casts performed in London in the spring of 1981, one a low-budget reggae production of The Tempest staged at the Oval in Brixton, and the other-which I chanced to see the fol- lowing night-a lavish production of Measure for Measure staged in the National's Lyttelton Theatre. The first was received with im- mense enthusiasm by a mostly black audience salted with punks and others. The second had a mixed reception by both reviewers and spectators, a typical National Theatre crowd of affluents, buffs, stu- dents, and tourists. As he wrote in his Director's Notes to the Cast, Michael Rudman set his National Theatre Measure for Measure "on a mythical Caribbean island. A mixture of Haiti and Trinidad. Mainly West Indian, be- cause there are a lot of very good West Indian actors. Mythical be- cause I don't want too many specific political parallels." He wanted to "place the characters in a political context that is familiar yet re- mote.... The point you want to touch in Shakespeare is where re- moteness and accessibility meet. Setting the play outside Europe makes it easier, for example, to believe in the fervour of Isabella's Catholicism." But perhaps most important of all: "If the events of Measure for Measure were to happen in closed rooms, they would not be so effective. I'm prejudiced toward public behaviour in Shake- speare. One should get a feeling ... that everything important that happens is going directly from the market-place to the nerve-ends of the State .... That's one reason for choosing to set the play on a Ca- ribbean island. One senses, when Castro speaks to a market-place full of people, that everything he says is going immediately into the bloodstream of the country." In the event, what confronted the audi- ence was an open plaza surrounded by balconies on which colorful supernumeraries were constantly lounging and milling about, Lucio in panama hat and Palm Beach suit sipping frozen daiquiris "on the stem," a great fat madam of a Mistress Overdone turning up at Marina's moated grange to play a whorehouse piano and sing the erstwhile Boy's song "Take O take those lips away," and so on. The production was undoubtedly original and visually appealing, and the Director's Notes to the Cast were persuasive enough. But such notes are not seldom partial, descriptive in the round, and remote from the details and entailed effects of production. If the intentional fallacy 523</page><page sequence="14">NEW LITERARY HISTORY lives, it is found more often in the relation between director and pro- duction than between writer and script. There seems little ground for objecting in theory to Rudman's treatment, though the Director's Notes are not auspicious. What was mainly wrong, owing to the gratuitous foregrounding, was that so little of the profoundly personal and ethical in Measure made it through the filter, which emphasized a languid tropical haze of per- vasive corruption very much a part of Shakespeare's script-except for the "languid tropical haze"-but far from all of it. In fact, Isabella seemed twice anomalous in a setting of such massive and amorally cheerful cupidity, and that was not part of Rudman's announced design. By contrast, the mostly nonprofessional but exuberant cast of Mi- chael Armitage's "The Tempest / Reggae Shakespeare," with "Reggae, Carnival, African dance &amp; drumming / Music by Wasimba"- breathed real creative life out of Shakespeare's Tempest without piti- fully disastering the script despite the disparity between stage-setting and script-setting, probably because the European reference was tac- itly mythologized as the background it already is in Shakespeare's script. The audience as a whole received it warmly. The setting was village Afro-Caribbean, with Prospero as headman/shaman, a burly, deep-voiced, benevolent tyrant who ruled his world with an assured and genial balance of firmness and compassion. Ariel was played by the lead singer of Wasimba, with hilarious refractoriness in an idiom consonant with Shakespeare's Ariel's: told to "Go! Hence with dili- gence!" (1.2.304), he sauntered off at leisure with an afro-comb sticking out of a back pocket and still later-with "I'll fetch them, sir" (5.1.32)-sticking out of his bikini. A droll way of dealing with colo- nialism and (in)subordination in the play, the pertinent places, and the production, which ended with a thoughtfully abbreviated epi- logue well attuned to the collective spirit: "But release me from my bands, / With the help of your good hands"-the cast and musicians joined in concert by an audience that clapped in time to this final refrain for a full ten minutes. With such community there needs no applause. It is not easy to get at the exact causes for the success of this production and the weaknesses of the National's Measure, but the sys- tematic relationship between production and audience is surely prominent-and easier come by when the audience is a smaller and homogeneous subset than a larger sampling from decidedly hetero- geneous communities. Aside from that important consideration, the impression conveyed was that the reggae Tempest had been thought out of, toward the audience, and the calypso Measure had been thought into, by the director-a state of affairs suggested by 524</page><page sequence="15">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES Rudman's being "prejudiced toward public behaviour in Shake- speare," perhaps. The reggae Tempest was clearly not a scholar's "authentic" produc- tion or a comprehensively nuanced contemporary one like Liviu Ciulei's at the Guthrie in the same year, but it exploited its own (im- plicit) "concept" very successfully for its audience and in itself; an alien familiar with the play could recognize both the script as written and read, and the reciprocal presence of the script in the production and the production in the script. Rudman's Measure, by contrast, per- sistently elicited awareness of ingenuity straining to stretch the script over an epic stage that dissipated much of the text in its recesses, an effect complemented by parts of the dialogue being all but inaudible, an accidental but "integral" circumstance. The less professional but more effective Tempest was a festive production that made a harmo- nious community of audience and players, and went far in its own way toward expressing, both with words and without, a persistent view of the potentialities of human kindness and its capacity for sym- pathetic imagination that is characteristically Shakespearean and especially Tempestatic. In such cases, a useful distinction may be found between the letter-faithful production of conventional staging, and a spirit-faithful production that systematically maintains the tone, atti- tudes, and interior relationships of the script, with the latter realizing "subtext" in faithful translation and the former in literal fidelity. IV In Liviu Ciulei's productions at the Guthrie, the production "con- cepts," though distinctive, have not been radically remote, and they do not automatically suggest the bent and detail of playing throughout; or, though their hallmarks are distinctive and memo- rable, they are still not the master key to details of performance and delivery. His productions characteristically begin with a provocative and enigmatic set, confronting the audience as soon as they enter the theater. For The Tempest (1981) a moat of blood surrounded the thrust stage, with various objects afloat in it symbolizing the history of human endeavor, its arts, sciences, and conflicts, some of these on the stage as well: the trunk of a suit of armor with the legs on stage and the upper body in the moat, for example. Conceived as the archetypal artist-scientist, Prospero was dressed by turns in a car- digan or smock-cum-lab coat, late Victorian and twentieth century, externally nondescript creativity personified. His identity was estab- lished at once in scene one by his carrying from backstage a ship 525</page><page sequence="16">NEW LITERARY HISTORY model like the storm-tossed ship projected on a large screen, begin- ning small, growing to fill the screen, sinking, as the characters on shipboard played out the scene while Prospero sat on the Dali-esque remains of a rowboat and contemplated the model. The ship (of state) like the island played its prominent physical part in the produc- tion as well as in the script: it merged with the human condition partly by virtue of its "deck" (1.1), which became the interior of Pro- spero's study-a magical room in which window, doorway, and a mirror in the raised cover of a miniature harpsicord opened on brightly lighted, Magritte-like azure seascapes on different planes, suggesting the "problematics" of nature, art, and science; this effect of enchantment was both heightened and erased when full lighting came up to reveal window and door as themselves an illusion, mere frames in a metal grillwork. Ciulei was trained as an architect, and his productions always have an architectonic dimension that speaks for itself but also blends with the dialogue and action. The dialectic of art and nature in As You Like It was conveyed at first sight by a center-stage Palladian-style gazebo of light wood, on the upper story of which musicians played Renais- sance-style music and from which various characters watched others perform unawares. Second and more strikingly, the dialectic was conveyed by a chorus of ten anthropomorphic trees-or dendro- morphic masquers-costumed after Inigo Jones's designs for Thomas Campion's Lords Maske of 1603. These were sometimes more humane than the humans themselves; for example, they read Or- lando's pathetic verses to themselves rather more sympathetically than Rosalind and Touchstone read them aloud with a hoot and a holler. Carts of the same wood as the gazebo were used liberally, changing "form" by virtue of application and flexibility of conven- tion-function, in short. Hawsered winches prominently visible on stage right and left appeared to shift the gazebo in its occasional movements a few feet downstage and back, a constant reminder that all was done by manifold efforts and inventions, seen and unseen (I am not sure this added much to the obvious, but it was consonant and unobtrusive enough not to detract). To an occasionally very comic Duke Frederick were contributed a bathtub that proved to be bot- tomless when he arose and walked backstage with it around him (2.2), and in a long red cape which fell to the ground at his departure to expose the Duke in long johns, his emperor's new clothes (3.2). All these contributions enhanced the action and significance; though not in the script, they were wholly consonant with the spirit and sense of what is. The same was true of the at once bittersweet and richly comic 1984 production of Ciulei's Twelfth Night in a "distillation-of-circus" idiom partly inspired by The Clowns and by Fellini generally. 526</page><page sequence="17">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES Ciulei's first three Shakespeare productions effectively made of Shakespeare's scripts something our-timely and artfully timeless, too, at least as those who are prepared to speak of timelessness measure it at the moment. A major means was his allowing the script to speak for itself through careful and faithful articulation of the dialogue, something that he did rather less in his 1985 production of A Mid- summer Night's Dream, his last before his resignation as Guthrie artistic director was to take effect in March of 1986. This Dream was a dark comedy about power politics and patriarchal abuses of power in par- ticular, a reading prescribed by the imperatives of our time, ac- cording to Ciulei. The Guthrie press release had it that "the play's festive tone, celebrating the bliss of a wedding and the rites of summer, contrasts sharply with a male-dominated social order," and it certainly did in this production, which was epitomized in the dumb show preceding the beginning of Shakespeare's script. From a dark- ened entrance at the back of the stark Chinese-red-vinyl-covered stage, two white-clad attendants carried a lighted brazier down front, strolling back whistling, until stifled by two entering representatives of Authority, also in white. Then, flanked by guards in white, a black Hippolyta in dark fatigues and with Grace Jones crewcut stalked in defiantly, high-heeled boots clicking, eyes flashing, and nostrils flaring. Expressionless female attendants in white ripped off the fa- tigues, threw them on the brazier, and dressed her in a floor-length white gown and vast cape. Next a condescending Theseus and his courtiers entered in white and politely applauded the duchess-to-be in her new clothes. Finally, Theseus's "Now fair Hippolyta, our nup- tial hour / Draws on apace," and so on. For one ecstatic reviewer, the production "sends your mind and emotions reeling into vertigo," but "there are loose ends of course, the chief one here probably inherent in the script. At play's end the glaring, icy Hippolyta does join in and adjourn with Theseus. They aren't arm in arm, and we still suspect it will be an uneasy night, but she is no longer resistant, and the play gives us no reason for her change in temper" (my italics). This inchoate adaptation had no means of tying up the loose ends without adding sufficient threads to complement the ones contributed at the beginning. V An extraordinary example of contemporary unorthodoxy in Shakespearean production is to be found in the work of Ariane Mnouchkine and her company of Le Theatre du Soleil, in the Cartou- cherie, Vincennes, just outside Paris. In 1982 she had in repertory 527</page><page sequence="18">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Twelfth Night and Richard II (performed in Los Angeles in 1984 in connection with the Olympic Games). These have since been joined by the First and Second Parts of Henry IV. In some ways her stage work resembles Akira Kurosawa's Noh-influenced film adaptation of Macbeth, which uses very little dialogue but has justly been called the best film yet made of a play by Shakespeare. Mnouchkine's produc- tions are appropriately but inadequately described as "exotic." Twelfth Night was classical East Indian kathakali in costume, movements, ges- tures, and music. The Japanese idiom of Richard II combined ele- ments of Kabuki, Noh, and Bunraku. Her productions use most of Shakespeare's dialogue, in her own French verse translations, but they express meaning especially through spectacle and nonverbal gesture: relentless energy manifested in gymnastics, mime, and con- stant movement punctuated by moments of charged and eloquent stillness; exotic settings analogical enough to beguile and suggest without annihilating sense; specially composed music attuned to the mode of dramatization and performed on a large variety of exotic instruments in plain sight, in a defined space at audience right, as an integral part of the spectacle; and dialogue chanted with emphatic pitch variation. Delivery of the dialogue studiously avoids "realism" and is at times addressed directly to the audience by actors aligned before them; it retains the cognitive and emotive force of the original not by verisi- militude but by rhetorical stress and theatrical framing: the script is clearly there, in a systematically adjusted, not distorted, perspective. The ambience and settings are world-enough-and-time-wide eclectic: a production idiom at first glance remote from the "reality" of the script world that in the event can be seen as an organically integrated "part" of it. The experience of Shakespeare in Le Theatre du Soleil irresistibly enlarges one's conception of the range of performing idiom Shakespeare's plays can sustain and even demand. The differ- ence between Banana Republic Julius Caesar and Japanesque Richard II is one apparently of degree that is in fact a difference in kind: changing only the setting and costumes in the former case empha- sizes the disparity; in Mnouchkine's versions, total refraction in per- formance crystallizes the script anew in what is paradoxically a pro- duction and an adaptation simultaneously. A major difference is in the strain on the script in the former case and the script in relief in the latter. Such productions need not, in my view should not, take the place of those more conventional, but they are invaluable parts of a larger performing whole that includes them: they explore the worlds of Shakespeare, art, and the human community together. Innovation in 528</page><page sequence="19">T HEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES theater as elsewhere is an imperative of our time, any time, not merely because it is a demand of passing fashion and economic im- peratives, though often it is both, but because, as Heraclitus lately might have said, the times they are a-changing always already. And it is fitting that Shakespeare, like Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 2, should be not only witty in himself but the cause that wit is in other persons. The whole of the periphery, the off-off, and the fringe of conception and production can be accommodated, should even be welcomed, provided there is somewhere a gravitational center, preferably in reg- ular active performance as well as in widespread familiarity and gen- eral understanding of what is going on in and through the script. That is, the script must be recognized in detail for something of what it was, and in altered cultural circumstances still is, in order to be coherently what it can be imaginatively in contemporary realization. VI The drift of this excursion is "purist" to the extent that respectful -not necessarily reverent, still less slavish-adherence to the infer- ably integral meanings of the script seems to me to have priority over every other aspect of production. Obviously these meanings are not writ in neon, but they can be localized within reasonable limits by attending first to the script and its internal relations, second to the complex of its times and historical relations, and then to apparent resemblances between a play's "objects of imitation" and the events and persons of our own times, proceeding with a calculus that though it cannot exclude the pressures of the present does not prematurely aggrandize the third at the expense of the first two. "If indeed Shake- speare crafted his plays according to a set of conventions or a sense of design that we ignore or make no effort to understand, how can we expect to realize the full extent of his characters, images, and meanings?"19 Or how can we expect to realize our own designs suffi- ciently if we do not understand the means and ends of a script being used as a means to present ends? If dialogue does not make consis- tent sense in performance, owing to cuts, reorientation, gratuitous emphases, persistent disparity between setting and dialogue, and the like, the resulting "production" will falsify Shakespeare's play, rarely "improving" upon it unless adaptation has been carried so far-as by Charles Marowitz or the many who have made musicals of Shake- speare's plays-that a substantial (re)composition results, a state of affairs we can applaud both on its own terms and for what more we can see of the original at the same time. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern 529</page><page sequence="20">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Are Dead is the joint creation of Shakespeare and Tom Stoppard, and we understand Hamlet the better in many ways by virtue of this off- spring, which owes much also to "our time" in general and to the influence of Samuel Beckett in particular. The Merchant of Venice affords an example of almost every kind of stress and strain, and also serves as a focal point for addressing varia- tions in production that convey, intensify, or falsify the designs of the script. Two crucial moments of script and production will illustrate, the treatment of either being something of a touchstone of interpre- tation at large and invariably implying the correlative playing of Shy- lock, the central problem of performance, because he can never again be quite the shalach, or cormorant, he was in Shakespeare's London (though never so simply in his script). The moments are the Casket scene (3.2), in which Bassanio chooses the lead casket with Portia's picture in it, and the delivery and staging of the play's final lines. The first epitomizes the relationship and character of Portia and Bassanio, and by implication Antonio and the rest of the Vene- tians, and Shylock by contrast; the second determines the harmony or discord of the whole in the concluding notes. J. C. Trewin suc- cinctly describes the casket situation. "We cannot guess ourselves how those caskets will be displayed at Belmont. In my first Merchant [seen in the English provinces as a child] they were obviously old cigar boxes, indifferently concealed. Most directors and designers work hard on them. I have known them huddled on a table, hidden behind tapestry, arranged on a flowerpot stand, wheeled in on a trolley, held by kneeling servants, disposed about the room, and once, and weirdly, enclosed in what resembled an automatic machine: we waited for Morocco to insert a ducat before the machine worked."20 The 1984 Royal Shakespeare Company production was remark- able chiefly for the designer's heavy hand and did not transfer to the Barbican in 1985. The set was defined by a huge oriental carpet as background that dominated continuously, as though the entire action took place within the casket, an effect complemented by the omni- presence of the caskets at the front of the set. These, the size and shape of British postboxes on pedestals, were held high on canti- levers that dropped them bouncing into place when needed for the choosing by Morocco, Arragon, and Bassanio, and when wanted oth- erwise to be seen to impinge upon the action. The point was evidently to convey-in effect throughout-that "so is the will of a living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father" (1.2.23-24) who tyran- nically forecloses on posterity. Two huge manned pipe organs were regrettably reminiscent of Terry Jones's naked piano-playing in some episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus. The actors found it both dif- ficult and necessary to perform against a set so oppressive. 530</page><page sequence="21">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES Trewin continues, "Komisarjevsky's singer of 'Tell me where is fancy bred', at Stratford in 1932, heavily stressed the rhymes to 'lead' -'bred', 'head', 'nourished'. It could not have been sillier, for in this scene, at the very centre of the Belmont story, Bassanio knows, Portia knows, and we know."2' But how do-we get shown that-they know? A question to be asked, and a complicating factor for any di- rector, is the ambiguous stage direction calling for "A song the whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself" (3.2.62 f., my italics). But the purport and effect are much the same whether the song is sung while he speaks audibly "to himself" the speech beginning "So may the outward shows be least themselves" or, while the song is sung, he is seen but not heard to comment "to himself" before begin- ning aloud with "So may," etc. The operative phrase is "to himself."22 However the choosing is staged, the script evidently has Bassanio at some distance from Portia when it takes place: Away then! I am lock'd in one of them,- If you do love me, you will find me out. Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof,- Let music sound while he doth make his choice, Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end, Fading in music.... Now he goes.... (3.2.40-45, 53; my italics) Representative treatments, opposed in tenor but neither extreme, are those of Jonathan Miller's film with Olivier as Shylock, and Mi- chael Langham's production at the Guthrie. In Miller's film, the caskets are on pedestals arranged in lazy-susan fashion. As Bassanio approaches them, two elderly women enter and begin singing "Where is fancy bred?" flanking and framing the lead casket during most of the song, in which the rhyme words are emphasized, with supporting glances at the lead casket by the singer nearest Bassanio. For a Bassanio thus surely if not blatantly instructed which to choose, his speech of deliberation following the song might seem both hypo- critical and redundant. In Langham's production, the song was sung softly at stage rear, unattended by Bassanio, who deliberated "whilst" the song was being sung. Ways of dramatizing Bassanio's trial abound, but a crucial difference is made by the presence or absence of an apparently deliberate hint confounding in a trice the integrity of Portia-"I could teach you / How to choose right, but then I am forsworn, / So will I never be" (3.2.10-12)-and the percipience and psychic affinity of Bassanio-"Away then! I [Portia] am locked in one of them,- / If you do love me you will find me out" (3.2.40-41). The following five stage endings of Merchant convey something of 531</page><page sequence="22">532 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the range of possibility more or less countenanced by Shakespeare's script at the second of these two crucial moments, the least counten- anced coming first. 1. Antonio is left alone on stage as melancholy as he was at the play's beginning. This ending typically has Antonio in unrequited love with Bassanio, making him anomalous in several ways and very prominent as such: at the expense of all the other principals, his mel- ancholy and its cause assume centrality in conclusion. 2. Jessica lingers after the others leave, while the kaddish-the Jewish lament for the dead-is heard. Thus Shylock is finally given memorial fixation and primary consequence in an ending almost in- evitable in Miller's film, which centralizes him. 3. In a combination of 1 and 2, in effect, first Bassanio and Portia, then Gratiano and Nerissa, leave by couples, in that order; next Lo- renzo and Jessica leave, the latter pensive and holding in her hand what could be the "merry bond" or, more likely, the will Shylock was obliged to sign by the settlement of act four, scene one; finally, An- tonio remains, discarding with apparent indifference the letter of good news Portia had just given him of his ships' coming safely to harbor. So ended the Chichester Festival Theatre production (Summer 1984), with Sir Alec Guinness as a dignified, subdued, and sympathetic but rather "neutral" Shylock in a production of indeter- minate, apparently undetermined, position. 4. Gratiano is last to leave, as in a commedia dell'arte production performed in London by Shared Experience and the Crucible Theatre of Sheffield in 1981: with Nerissa over his shoulder, poste- rior to audience, Gratiano delivered the play's last lines, "Well, while I live, I'll fear no other thing / So sore, as keeping safe Nerissa's ring," making an appropriate literal and symbolic gesture with a "ring" of thumb and index finger. Gratiano does, after all, have the last lines in The Merchant of Venice as we have it, in an authoritative Quarto text based on copy very close to Shakespeare's manuscript. In the most recent revival of the play by the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1984 Gratiano again had the concluding words and emphasis. 5. "Exeunt"-they leave-the concluding stage direction and last "line" of the authoritative Quarto text. The nearest to this are the commedia and Royal Shakespeare Company productions (4), since Gratiano's words are not erased by a subsequent impression. There are few performing spaces from which all the actors present could leave together, abreast, and arm in arm, as it were; hence the varia- tion in who goes last, and how in accordance with whom. But what- ever we may choose to make of Shakespeare's Merchant, he himself</page><page sequence="23">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES apparently ended it without Shylock but with virtually all others present-including Antonio-together and in evidently festive spirit. VII Well then, Legitimate Edgar, I must haue your land, Our Fathers loue, is to the Bastard Edmond, As to th'legitimate: fine word: Legitimate. Well, my Legittimate, if this Letter speed, And my inuention thriue, Edmond the base Shall to'th'Legitimate: I grow, I prosper: Now Gods, stand vp for Bastards.23 In the preceding discussion I have been concerned all along with the issue of "legitimate production" of classic plays as an issue of cur- rency and concern for the many constituencies of contemporary the- ater, where often enough "novelty is only in request."24 If there is a finite range of "legitimate productions" of Shakespeare's plays, it is not easily defined, because theatrical performance involves at least two orders of analysis and evaluation that do not necessarily and in practice very often do not coincide: they center on the meaning(s) of the script and on the significance of performance. E. D. Hirsch's terms point usefully in the right direction: what a play meant for its playwright and original audiences, what a play in production signifies in contemporary performance, and how far a modern production is consonant with, and an extension of, the play as originally conceived and performed-so far as we know and can reasonably infer.23 In fact, the dialectic of meaning and significance must come into play at a premiere production, since there is invariably some tension be- tween script and performance that has finally to be resolved in favor of the latter; the greater the distance of the playwright from his or her performers and audience, both metaphorically and in actual pro- duction, the greater the tension is likely to be. In the case of Shakespeare's plays, the issues are further compli- cated by the fact that there is continuing disagreement over what many of the plays mean. Without a consensus about a given play, how can we define a range of legitimate productions? The answer is, in part, I think, that such a range includes, in varying degree, any ten- able interpretation of a play, and there are sufficient untenable inter- pretations about, by responsible consensus, that one may hypothesize about a tenable remainder. If Hamlet is not necessarily a play chiefly 533</page><page sequence="24">NEW LITERARY HIS TORY about Oedipal complications, those can hardly be excluded from the realm of possibility while they retain psychological explanatory power in a culture, especially when the Oedipus complex has recently been argued to be culturally specific and fairly narrowly so, and arguably correlative with the development of a nuclear family-in the Renais- sance, for example. On the other hand, Shakespeare's play is not about a woman in disguise, though so played by Asta Nielsen on film in 1920, where "she" is discovered by Horatio's opening Hamlet's doublet to ease "his" last gasp. Such playing is "provocative" (and in this event irresistibly risible), but it is "from the purpose of playing," which has tacit obligations to hold the mirror up to the nature of its script as well as to such "reality" as a representational script may be said to imitate. This is bound to vary somewhat from its own to our time as humors psychology gives way to ego psychology and so on. Much contemporary production of classics seems to be concerned less with producing scripts than in seeing what those scripts may yield by way of the unexpected. Motives could be found in many quarters, including auteur and explorers' impulses, the imperatives of "rele- vance," the attractions of "concept" production, the demand of audi- ences for variety, and box-office pressures, but the effect is in general the same: novelty arrived at by departure from the script. In partic- ular, of course, "departure" is a matter of degree: if Shakespeare's comedies are performed with various "circus" redactions, as The Comedy of Errors was by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1983 and 1984 and Twelfth Night by the Guthrie in 1984, its essentials of human action, character, and dialogue need not be confounded by the new compounding; the scripts themselves are charged with tongue-in- cheek implausibilities, and the identity crises and losses of temper that constitute their serious matter are already tinctured in the plays as written. Comedy in general lends itself readily enough to excesses without losing its essential nature, but its particular meanings may be another matter, as in A Midsummer Night's Dream, which has been much set upon in productions of the past twenty years: its orders of magic and hallucination seem to solicit psychogenetics and hallucino- genetics of every kind, and its depths are rather easily muddied by contemporary stirrings. The problems of evaluating idiosyncratic production are due in large part to the elementary fact that relationship to the script is usually but sometimes erroneously assumed to be one of (re)produc- tion, realizing the script. Presentation distant from the script will ac- cordingly be faulted by those who see the latter lost in the former. "Adaptations" acknowledged as such-like Charles Marowitz's Shakespeare collages-explicitly invite entirely different perspec- 534</page><page sequence="25">THEATRICAL SHAKESPEAREGRESSES tives, interpretations, and evaluations. A recent instance at the Guthrie was a "production" that, if it had been called "Lucien Pin- tilie's [Adaptation of] Chekhov's The Seagull," could hardly have been faulted for what was never attempted: conventional production. "Lu- cian Pintilie's dismembered and rearranged version of 'The Seagull' had Guthrie patrons firmly divided-some muttering about the rape of Chekhov and others glowing with the pleasure of seeing an inven- tive reconstruction of a play from the standard repertoire."26 The pro- duction was in its own way both original and parasitic: whether the new work of theatrical art was better or worse than the original, or separate but equal, was the appropriate question, but it was seldom asked because of uncertainty about the work's status. If this were a matter merely of accurate truth-in-labeling, and gen- erally understood as a case of caveat emptor, it would be a matter of limited consequence. But in cultural circumstances where scripts are seldom or never available in conventional production, their sense and form are lost to all but readers, who themselves have only abbreviated experience of the play. This is a cultural as well as dramatic loss of a serious order. It is to the credit of the sometimes gratuitously ma- ligned BBC-Time/Life series of television films of Shakespeare's plays that on the whole they have striven for conventional produc- tion. If some of the productions are not very good, it is doubtful whether conventionality as such is responsible. There is substantial agreement if not unanimity, for example, that the conventional Romeo and Juliet is lifeless and dull, while Measure for Measure is vig- orous and engaging. The anchorage of conventional production is in any case not very difficult to identify in general. It consists in a play's action, characters, dialogue, settings, and sound effects, musical and otherwise, as the script presents them and a receptive reader finds them, and its "meanings" as a compound of entailed affects and cognitions, both progressive and cumulative. A reader of a play loses much more, no doubt, than effects peculiar to performance, but a competent reader has every chance of a sound grasp of what it is "about" in relation to those realities of human action and passion it has stylized. Such a reader may be self-tutored or taught by others, but the effect should be much the same: a prepared spectator. Among the obstacles to agreement on whether there is "legitimate production" and what its boundaries are, two seem all but insur- mountable if any sort of comprehensive consensus is sought. First, contemporary theater in practice is often "driven" by one of two mo- tive forces or both together-box office and deliberate ideology. To the extent that either is allowed prior claims on production, they are 535</page><page sequence="26">NEW LITERARY HISTORY the criteria of "legitimacy": if a production brings in audiences and makes a profit, or is made to say or do what is politically correct ac- cording to whatever faction determines correctness, it is "legitimate" because prescribed. Second, the irreconcilability of apparently deci- mated and certainly beleaguered "liberal humanist" critics and audi- ences, on the one hand, and their legion entrenched opponents, on the other.2-7 If "seeking to establish a continuity between the past and the present" and "focusing on 'universal' themes such as justice, chastity, appearance vs. reality, love and marriage, freedom vs. restraint, folly, avarice, time, order vs. chaos, deception, good vs. evil, and so on" are reprehensibly "idealist" in abstracting "the play from its history and the material conditions of its production,"28 there is not much lati- tude for the position of John Barton and his Royal Shakespeare Company actors as represented in Playing Shakespeare. There a pri- mary question for both is "the pragmatic one, 'how does Shake- speare's text actually work?' " (3). This project proceeds from the as- sumption that "we are of today but the text endures" (182), and in the conviction that "Shakespeare is timeless in the sense that he anat- omises and understands what is in men and women in any age, and what he has to say is always true and real. It is this element that is truly contemporary and which the wise actor or director will try to bring out" (190). If there are norms of signification within a script that may be observed with more or less propriety and clarity, of the sort that Barton finds firmly in Shakespeare's plays, for example, then there is a hypothetical range of legitimate production. It will not yield an instant gauge of individual productions, but it does provide a conceptual basis for interpreting and evaluating theatrical interpreta- tions-with due allowance, too, for legitimate differences. Touch- stone has something in "Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If."29 UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA NOTES 1 Call for Papers for the 1983 MMLA meeting, with thanks to the Chair, Professor Louis R.

Berry understandably "know[s] of no general criteria for judging such adaptations: each one is a separate enterprise, and will be judged on the skill and tact with which the adaptor interprets and re-animates the vital essences of the original text," when, I should add, the purposes of adaptation are as they are here said to be ("faithful," in effect) and in practice were in the Henrv VI adaptations. In Modern Shakespeare Offshoots (Princeton, 1976), Ruby Cohn "use[s] a looser and more neutral word, 'offshoot,' for the 'array of names' by which 'rewriting of Shakespeare' is known" (p. 3). She classifies "offshoots that are close to a Shakespearean text by the process that molds them: reduction/emendation.... Adaptation, probably the most overused term for a Shakespeare offshoot, will constitute the second group," characterized by substantial cuts, "much alteration of language," and-in a definition supplied by Christopher Spencer-one or more "important (or scene-length) additions.... Invention will be the basis for the third grouping, transformation" (pp. 3-4). 11 In Roman Polanski's film influenced by Jan Kott's Shakespeare Our Contemporary (London, 1964), there is an emphatic instance of Kott's Grand Mechanism come full circle: near the beginning, Macbeth is first seen riding horseback along a mountain trail where he meets the three witches (1.3); at the end, after Malcolm's soliloquy, Donalbain-in Shakespeare's script not seen or mentioned again after he announces his departure for Ireland in 2.4-is seen riding along the same trail. 12 Another access is provided by Michael Green's study of The Art of Coarse Acting, rev. ed. (New York, 1981), first published as Downwind of Upstage (London, 1964). 13 Two discussions of particular interest in this connection are Norman Rabkin's "Meaning and The Merchant of Venice" in Shakespeare and the Problem of Meaning (Chi- cago, 1981) and a dialogue between Royal Shakespeare Company directorJohn Barton and two recent Royal Shakespeare Company Shylocks, David Suchet and Patrick Stewart, in "Exploring a Character: Playing Shylock," in Playing Shakespeare. 14 "Concept" has as much inflammatory power for some as it has explanatory power for others. The term is used in effect to refer to the novelty dimension, especially when pronounced; a "concept" of some sort is implicit in any production that has a system- atic relationship to the text. 15 David Hume, "Of Simplicity and Refinement in Writing" (1741), Philosophical Works (Boston and Edinburgh, 1854), III, 213-14. 16 Performed at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1983 and at the Barbican in 1984. 17 Irving Wardle, The Times, 21 April 1983. My italics. 18 The production may have "lightened" somewhat between Stratford-upon-Avon and its rebirth at the Barbican in August 1984, when it struck more of a balance be- tween the comic and overtly serious, the latter taking the elegiac part of its keynote from Feste's concluding song and its refrain, "For the rain it raineth every day." The melancholy mood was conveyed partly by the prominent, almost cinematic music, to- gether with sound effects associated with the weather, and partly by the set, which had the action taking place in front of a hillock with frowning clouds and lowering sky in motion almost throughout.</page><page sequence="28">538 NEW LITERARY HISTORY 19 Alan C. Dessen, Elizabethan Stage Conventions and Modern Interpreters (Cambridge, 1984), p. 162. 20 J. C. Trewin, Going to Shakespeare (London, 1978), p. 111. 21 Trewin may seem precipitate in dismissing the protracted debate over the hint, but he has the support of Occam's razor as well as the reasons given with succinct compre- hensiveness by John Russell Brown in the New Arden Edition (1955; corr. rpt. London, 1959), p. 80. 22 "There are some directions which probably only Shakespeare could have written. A book-keeper in the theatre would not think of adding that ... Bassanio comments on the caskets 'to himselfe'"; J. R. Brown, New Arden edition, p. xiv. 23 KingLear 1.2.15-22 (TLN 349-56); Folio (1623), sigg. qq3r+v 24 Duke Vincentio's entire speech is pertinently pointed: "None [i.e., 'news abroad in the world'], but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request, and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure, but security enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every days news" (MM 3.2.212-20). 25 E. D. Hirsch, "Meaning and Significance Reinterpreted," Critical Inquiry, 11 (1984), 202-25; Hirsch's modifications usefully enlarge upon the terms he first ad- vanced in 1960. 26 David Hawley, reviewing Pintilie's subsequent production-adaptation-of Mo- liere's Tartuffe in St. Paul Pioneer Press, 3 August 1984. 27 See Terry Eagleton: "Liberal humanism has dwindled to the impotent conscience of bourgeois society, gentle, sensitive and ineffectual." Literary Theory: An Introduction (Minneapolis, 1983), p. 199. 28 Derek Longhurst, "'Not for all time, but for [sic] an Age': an approach to Shake- speare studies," in Re-Reading English, ed. Peter Widdowson (London, 1981), p. 157. In "Dialectical Immaterialism," American Scholar, 54 (1985), 449-65, Frederick Crews finds the Achilles heel on the other foot: "the loyal Marxist is precisely someone who identifies himself with an ordained class of people to whom 'history' has granted extra liberties, and thus he will be unlikely to recognize that the theory is undemocratic and mischievous in its essence. Instead, he will appease his conscience by blaming 'the capi- talists' for thwarting history's wishes and goading the international Left into regret- table overreactions" (452). "If, as we are told, Western Marxism is now in general retreat, we might expect the Marxist theorizing that finds its way into the Anglo-Amer- ican academy to be a humble and academic affair. Among the more conscientious radical professoriat, that is indeed the case. The atmosphere of Left Eclecticism, how- ever, constitutes a temptation to wanton posturing. Under that dispensation, and more particularly in the absence of the passe assumption that theories are supposed to ac- count for data more parsimoniously and cogently than their rivals, a Marxist academic need only skirt the classic dilemmas of his tradition-making sure, however, to iden- tify his claims as avant-garde in provenance and affinity-to gain a place at the ban- quet table of radical pan-theoreticism" (458). 29 As You Like It 5.4. 103-04.</page></plain_text>
