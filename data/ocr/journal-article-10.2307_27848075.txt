<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW DIALUX 20 DEFINES THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN MICROSCOPE DESIGN AND OPTICS. The Dialux 20 embodies the most recent Leitz?developed re finements in the technology of light microscopy. The new in strument offers a number of sig nificant innovations. The universal condenser is truly universal. It can be used for brightfield, darkfield, phase and differential interference con trast. It uniquely permits Koehler illumination down to an objective magnification of 1.6:1. New NPLfluotarobjectivesfor the Dialux 20 contain glasses that were specially developed by the Leitz Glass Research Labor atory in Wetzlar. The use of these unique glasses and of the latest techniques in optical design pro duces images with edge-to edge sharpness and remark able contrast even at full illu mination aperture. Every technological advance is also coupled with human en gineering to assure operational ease and reduce fatigue. To mention only one example, the objectives are color-coded LUX0 and their outer sleeves can be rotated so that the engravings al ways face the observer for rapid identification. Fine adjustment conveniently moves the object stage over the entire 35mm range of coarse ad justment. And three different beam splitters are provided in the photo tube to direct 10%, 50% or 100% of the light to the eye, the rest to the camera. The microscope stand is un usually stable. And its broad base is completely enclosed to protect optical elements even under conditions of rigorous lab oratory use. The Dialux 20 is equipped with an interchangeable lamp housing for light sources up to 100W to meet diverse applica tions. A second version, the Dialux 20 EB, offers a built-in 20W halogen lamp and volt meter for routine use. The Dialux 20. An outstand ing example of superb optical and mechanical engineering. We urge you to evaluate it for yourself. For more information, contact E. Leitz, Inc., Dept. AS 7. Rockleigh, NJ. 07647. Leitz means precision.

Now that says something about body toughness. Once, in a less severe dive, our instru ments went with him. And we found that his chest safely withstands "g" forces beyond those commonly thought to be injurious. Learning about the impact response of the body is just one phase of our extensive biomedicai research program at the General Motors Research ?^ ^^^^^^^^? Laboratories. The JHHHHjjH^^J goal in this phase: j^^Hjj^^^^^^H Develop a better un- gBBHBnBHB of man's ^^^^^^^^^^^^ reaction and tolerance ^ | ^ | to ^^^^^^H To we ^^^^^^^m^H have done mechan- H^^^^^^^^l ical response and trauma studies on the head, chest, and leg; on tissue; and on the body as a whole. WeVe also developed mathematical models of the man car system for simulating crashes in a com puter and predicting car occupant kinematics. Another phase of our work concerns the health effects that may be related to GM products. It includes respiratory response to air pollutants, the dynamics of air flow in the lungs, and tox icity investigations. The program in biomechanics started here some 15 years ago. It spawned the first energy-absorbing steering column put into production... a head-injury-severity index used by the United States Department of Transportation and football helmet designers ... a sophisticated anthropomorphic test dummy. Our biomedicai research continues, through meaningful data, to promote GM's most important commitment to society: a safer, practical car and a healthier environment.
