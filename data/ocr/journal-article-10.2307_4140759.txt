<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NORMALISTIC SUBJECT AND ITS CURVES: ON THE SYMBOLIC VISUALIZATION OF ORIENTEERING DATA TRANSLATED BY MIRKO M. HALL H Ien Link m First, a current discursive event that deserves to be called more than simply "molecular": on September 2, 2000, the (Springer) Bildzeitung headlined its issue with a downward-moving grey, white, and red serpentine curve that illustrated the rate of the euro from its beginning at $1.18 to its then current position at $.90. On the curve, three small golden-blue euros, in each of which a crack is forming, roll into the valley of the curve-at the bottom a large euro patheti- cally explodes into six fragments (after waiting undamaged and pre- dominantly golden at the beginning of its ride in the upper left). The background is pitch black and carries the text: "So many men who introduced it failed in work and life"-and in the large bold print typical for the Bildzeitung: "Curse over the Euro?" Finally, we see four face portraits alongside the curve with block texts like "Shot himself dead;" "4 years imprisonment;" "Corruption, resignation;" and "Agonizing death from cancer." We are dealing with a discursive event to the extent that the Bildzeitung has for a long time resisted the general trend of the Ger- man and international print media of disseminating the "normalistic curve-landscape." In the following paper, I would like to follow this landscape with several thoughts. Only very recently did the Bild- zeitung begin to publish selected economic data and popularity tests in the form of curves. For decades, other publications regularly dis- seminated the infographs of the agency Globus Kartendienst or those of other partly homespun productions. Since the 1990s at the latest, Cultural Critique 57-Spring 2004-Copyright 2004 Regents of the University of Minnesota</page><page sequence="2">48 JURGEN LINK these presses published complex curve-landscapes in all of the eco- nomic pages at least, from which they spread out into other columns. Ernst Schulte-Holtey has shown that entirely new media like Focus and Die Woche originated in the nineties in Germany, and were con- sciously conceived-at least subdominantly-as "publications of curve-landscapes."' If one inquires about the possible reasons for the reservation of the Bildzeitung, one could cite the traditional credo of many pop journalists more than reasons of cost. These journalists shun all statistics because of their mathematical connotations and because they believe that only large photos of individual people can make possible a heartfelt identification. Since its beginning in 1986, the surprising success of the American illustrated newspaper USA Today shows that this credo cannot certainly be absolute or even generally true: with this publication, we are dealing-very much like Focus and Die Woche-with a distinct publication of curve-landscapes with large infographics like the euro curve. These infographics appear i:LIX iii iii ii i ii- - 085Koinde, geid .4...? eirt s*ttr4 e tlo r Tr L ser-elef n; 0 054/ 0 Roi V64o, 40) Um-, Di -il j , 0..,J~h- d M??Ie N"? t ? ? t? ( sl'w - 1 p r dq?

Hence, processes of subjective iden- tification can also take place with curves that condense statistical knowledge, an idea that the editorial staff of the Bildzeitung was the last to grasp. Interestingly, this insight could have come through another field entirely, one apparently very far away from economics and politics: in any case, for some time now the Bildzeitung has also subscribed to the trend that originated in the United States of representing the horoscope in the form of a curve. Here, the curve (swinging simply between "+" and "-") shows one's relative degree of "happiness." Such a procedure naturally rests on the presupposi- tion that the "normal" reader already lives "in a curve-form"-that is, the reader perceives its existential feeling like an economic rate between ups and downs. The euro curve is a regression curve, that is, a negative growth curve. It is explicitly mythologized in the version of the Bildzeitung: A curse that hovers over gold and money has been known from the beginning in Western modernity and especially since Richard Wag- ner-actually the four leading European politicians function under this curse as modern Nibelungen. However, as the examples of both USA Today and the horoscope curve show, such a mythologizing act of a traditionalistic type is obviously not necessary to subjecti- vize curve-landscapes and, in an emphatic sense, to make the curve- landscape consumable for subjects. A "dramatically" falling curve (as it is called) is already explicitly anthropomorphic-just like a steeply ascending one. The euro curve can also be interpreted as fatal with- out recourse to a traditional myth-and precisely as a crash: here, modern recipients think less of Icarus than of a contamination out of airplane and computer. This modern collective symbolism2 (as I call it) generates entirely spontaneous modern myths, whose special nature I will later address more closely. These myths have a much greater impact on the modern public than archaic ones. The crash curve of the euro concretely signals the danger of denormalization: such a crash appears to be no longer normal. But as we all know from our every- day experiences, the criterion of normality is the deciding criterion of orienteering in modern Western societies-just as its deciding bor- ders are limits of normality, that is, borders between the normal and</page><page sequence="4">INR KLOKtN,,Otl OP (HINA-WEISHEITLUM . aZ o TAG DES LERNENSO.'

In such societies, doubt-free "needs for action" [Hand- lungsbedarf] are only established in cases where a limit of normality is exceeded. Hence, the modern drama of the euro curve lies very simply in the question of whether the euro has already fallen short of or whether it approaches its lower limit of normality. Here, questions about the chances of normalization hang together automatically: can a so-called bottom building succeed, and where, and when?3 In this context, the information about the four politicians is of course entirely relevant and precisely as the (so-called) "psychological fac- tors" of the trends of curves. I will return to this. For the moment, I must present the concept of "normalism" in the tightest condensation:4 Under "normalism," one understands the entirety of all discursive as well as practically intervening proce- dures, dispositives, instances, and institutions, through which "nor- malities" are produced and reproduced in modern societies. The dispositives of large-scale data processing are especially constitutive of normalism, that is, statistical dispositives in the widest sense: the level of data collection includes the dispositive of polling, the level of evaluation includes the dispositive of mathematical-statistical dis- tribution theories, and the level of practical intervention includes all dispositives of social redistribution. Here, the normalities that are produced and reproduced are fundamentally characterized by "aver- aged" distributions (i.e., a wide middle "normal range" with a thick composition and two generally symmetric "abnormal" extreme zones with a thin composition). These distributions approach more ideal- typically5 a "symbolic Gauss-like distribution." According to this ac- count, these dispositives of a regular, systematic, and all-encompassing data processing represent the historical a priori of normalism, which correspondingly would have first originated in the eighteenth cen- tury. In connection to Foucault, I use the paradoxical term historical a priori in the sense of the emergence of a fundamentally culturally constitutive complex of knowledge that was not previously avail- able and that opens many new possibilities for a long-lasting epoch (longue durde). Hence, in a cultural-historical view, my thesis implies that it is worthwhile not to forcibly equate modern "normalities" with universal "custominariness," "ordinariness," and "everyday- ness," but rather to denote their cultural-historical specificity or to</page><page sequence="6">52 I 30RGEN LINK single this specificity out. "Normalities" would then be specific to the extent that they are not typically put into place merely spontaneously nor as the result of explicitly normative prescriptions, but rather as the result of the targeted "normalizations" of disturbances of speci- fic dynamics of modem growth-whereby these disturbances are decoded on the basis of the all-encompassing and continuing statisti- cal data processing that results in the specific courses of curves that signal "denormalization." Such an example would be the creation of "normal" demographic, economic, or psychic "growth" through each specific "normalizing" intervention. I will address this more concretely in the following pages. Moreover, the previous example would have made clear that the concept of normalism fundamentally relates to sociocultural (and not to "natural") "normalities." If, from the outset, biology and especially medicine have played a constitu- tive role in normalism, then the concept also stresses precisely the dominant cultural dimension of biological and medical "normalities." This concept is also critically opposed to the conception of "natural normalities" in the spirit of ideological criticism. What I call the "curve-landscape"-that is, the totality of in- fographics in the service of data processing-is perhaps the most important dispositive of normalism. The founding year of the curve- landscape could be considered 1786, when William Playfair's The Commercial and Political Atlas was published with the first modern infographs of growth curves and landscapes of even more competing curves. When concerned with essential elements, the euro curve of the Bildzeitung represents a mere reproduction of these infographs. The history of infographs is only beginning to be researched and still promises many interesting discoveries.6 I must limit myself here to the current synchrony, which one can grasp as a mature dispositive, especially since the deployment of computers. If we ask ourselves what above all characterizes normalistic data processing and curve-landscapes, then it is the homogenization of objects, which again produces comparability and quantifiability on a mass basis. This process is borrowed from physics, so that Adolphe Quetelet (also an important name in the history of infographics) could speak of a "Physique sociale."7 The early demographic, anthro- pometric, and economic curve-landscapes deal with the data process- ing of homogeneous mass events like births, deaths, suicides, body</page><page sequence="7">THE NORMALISTIC SUBJECT AND ITS CURVES 53 sizes, and so on. The more large-scale this process is, the better the mathematical-statistical analysis grasps the data, with its determina- tion of averages, distribution properties, breadth of dissemination, and development trends over time. Since Quetelet had reduced his data on soldiers-through massive manipulations-to the formula of normal distribution (i.e., the Gauss curve),8 this very curve appeared as the royal road in most of the newly constructed curve-landscapes- above all, regarding the corporeal and intellectual achievements up to Binet and his "intelligence quotient." Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, one of the most important theorists and practitioners of nor- malism in the belle 6poque before and around 1900, indeed saw in normal distribution a "cosmic" in-surance [Ver-sicherung]9 against every form of chaos and anarchy: I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the "Law of Frequency of Error." The law would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason. Whenever a large sample of chaotic element are taken in hand and marshaled in order of their magnitude, an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along. The tops of the marshaled row form a flowing curve of invariable pro- portions; and each element, as it is sorted into place, finds, as it were, a pre-ordained niche, accurately adapted to it.10 Here, the normalistic statistical scientist, Galton-in terms of the subjective application and mythologization of the curve-landscape- does not fall short of the Bildzeitung. Certainly the Gauss curve was- at least in that weakened form, which I call the "symbolic Gauss-like curve" [Gaufjoidkurve]-more likely capable of being implemented in static conditions of data than in powerfully dynamic ones. How- ever, the most important function of normalism, which is only a fundamentally modern occurrence, might lie precisely in the orien- teering in-surance against the inherent risks of the hyperdynamic trends of curves that are frequently described as symbolically "expo- nential." Galton was absolutely fixated on the forced growth of human faculties and was for this reason so interested in geniuses and ingenuity. In his speculative studies on the heredity of faculties,</page><page sequence="8">54 J3RGEN LINK Galton came upon the regression curve of ingenuity, which subse- quently tended to revert first-class faculties to the average in inheri- tance. Since that time, one can say that both theoretical and practical normalism in all normal-fields search primarily for the conditions and regularities of normal growth, even if an enduring exponential growth should not be possible. In the service of this search, there is, finally, everything that concerns tinkering with curve-landscapes. If it is true that the normalistic curve-landscape prepares the quasi-physical and apparently high-grade "objective" conditions of data for highly "subjective" application and orienteering of modern individuals (particularly, orienteering for action), then its constitutive structure appears to be based on a polar tension: between reification and personal existence, between masses and individuals, between natural-scientific laws and free decisions or elective actions. This tension appears at first glance nearly unresolvable-the contradic- tion seems impossible to mediate. From a statistical perspective, the "fate" of a specific individual "atom" is indeed absolutely uninterest- ing. Francis Galton constructed a simulation apparatus (the famous "Galton board" [Quincunx]) by which-through a sieve-like laby- rinth of nails that are arranged in regular succession, and through which a ball deviates with equal probability to the left or right-the normal distribution of the mass of a ball is illustrated." In my study, I have suggested expanding the "Galton board" to a general normal- istic redistribution simulator called a "Galton sieve."12 In all these models, individuals are represented through homogenous balls; these models are only interested in mass fate: According to the laws of probability, a specific percentage of the balls will fall into a marginal position that symbolizes "abnormality," while the vast majority of the balls will find themselves situated within the middle normal range. Therefore, from an objective perspective, each individual ran- dom walk of each arbitrary ball is always already "in order." However, the situation will be different if we proceed to the subjective interior perspective of a specific concrete ball, as it can be simulated by liter- ary or filmic narrations, for example. Then a random walk that ends in a marginal position represents the stressful fate of a possibly tragic process of dropping out like that of Franz Biberkopf in Doblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz. This text is exemplary of a dominant and fascinating</page><page sequence="9">THE NORMALISTIC SUBJECT AND ITS CURVES 55 type of modernity that concerns a large identity-forming power, which I have analyzed as a narration type of the (not) normal ride.13 One can regard the normalistic curve-landscape-understood as the totality of infographics in which the objective conditions of data are symbolically subjectivized-as a kind of semi-finished product of the above-mentioned type of narration. Therefore, the question can be asked: how, in detail, does this transfer of the objective into the subjective proceed? Already, mathematical curves can convey anthropomorphic connotations of an aesthetic kind-as soon as we are dealing with statistical curves with social, medical, psychological (and so forth) object relations, there automatically exists a massive overdetermination through the system of the currently dominant col- lective symbolism in whose field the entire curve-landscape func- tions. On the basis of Freud's dream theory, one understands "over- determination" as multiple determinations or the multiple symbolic function of a pictorial or textual element-that is to say, a kind of polyphony. Since the collapse of the East Bloc and the subsequent unprecedented and almost exponential market boom, we are accus- tomed to the bombardment of phallically stretched arrows of growth in nearly all contexts. These arrows (which can also be realized as upward-stretched thumbs) condense the normalistic signals that radiate from clearly ascending growth-curves. They thereby connect a semantic function of information (for example, "The T-stock has risen") with an affective function of appeal to the subject ("I can feel a winner"-or, also: "Now I'll finally pull myself together and buy stocks so that my mood will likewise rise sharply"). I also character- ize this concretization of the symbolic appeal by the receiving subject as a "pragmatic application by the subject," whereby the symbolic complex of text and picture serves as a model that is "taken into the inner self" or "introjected" (Freud) by the receiving subject. This sub- ject never receives mere "facts," as the relevant media would like to think, but rather simultaneously receives (so to speak) psychody- namic prostheses: The application of ascending curves expresses itself as euphoric-optimistic and those of falling curves as a feeling [Stimmung] of the subject that has a depressive-pessimistic nuance. Discourse analysis is able to reconstruct in detail what the media vaguely characterizes as the "psychology of economics" or claims</page><page sequence="10">56 JORGEN LINK from a purely empirical standpoint in polls about the current distrib- ution of optimism and pessimism of a population. Examples show further typical elements of collective symbolism. Under this, I would like to understand the totality of all forms of "figurality" [Bildlichkeit] of a culture-hence, not only symbols in the sense of Goethe and Freud, but also allegories, emblems, illustra- tive models, comparison, metaphors, metonyms, and synecdoches. In addition to allegories, all other symbolic personifications-includ- ing typical friend and foe images-belong to collective symbolism. As understood through my argument, the normalistic structures of data are subjectivized through infographs in many respects. On the one hand, the curves are completed through symbolic figures, that is, subjects with positive and negative appeals of identification. On the other hand, the curves themselves send out positive and negative appeals to the subject in which they mark and offer for "application" zones of supernormal chance, subnormal risks (hence, positive and negative abnormalities) and in-suring normality. To the extent that the figures of the infographs connote both actions and conflicts, and to the extent that the curves connote processes in themselves, both fragments and building blocks of modern myths automatically con- nect themselves to the collective symbolism.14 Here, I use the struc- turalist concept of myth: In the sense of Claude Levi-Strauss and Roland Barthes, myth is a story with symbolic actors whose fate offers orienteering marks and contributions of meaning for the re- ceiving subject. Hence, we are not primarily dealing with the cir- cumstance that such a myth is fictive or "not based on fact"; rather it concerns myth's function as a model of application. Moreover, I stress the specifying adjective "modern": not just as a "curse" as in the Nibelungen myth, but rather as a "view into the maelstrom of the downward spiral and into the abyss of denormalization." Just as the ancient soothsayers studied the flight of birds, so do modern "ana- lysts" interrogate these curves for specific patterns (mostly simplified with letter forms named "V-formation," "W-formation," "M-formation," and so on), out of which they think they can draw prognoses about normality or the denormalization of future courses. With these prog- noses, the meaning of the individual fates of curves is placed in the perspective of the central modern myth of the endless growing snake (of progress). This myth continually understands temporary</page><page sequence="11">Kurvenlandschaft (&gt;innerer Bildschirm) Normalistische Basis-Kurven growth-Kurven (linear) (Senkrechtstart) (Aufschwung) (Aus-dem- Ruder-laufen) symbol.

The main function of the myth lies, therefore, in the in-surance of a nonetheless resonating fear of denormalization and an irreversible crash, as it connotatively radiates out of each longer downward spiral (i.e., a longer downward- directed WM-formation). Especially exemplary for the normalistic subjectivization of objective conditions of data are the representations of subjects that appear to "ride" on curves and that attempt to bend their curves like unruly horses in the desired direction. Typical here is the effort of a subject to again "pull upward" a crashing curve in which a kind of "tug" [Ruck] is symbolized (which was made famous through the former German federal president Roman Herzog). This action illus- trates most suggestively the influence of a subjective "will" on an objective tendency. If one comprehends the totality of such a subjec- tive ride on curves and extrapolates them onto the curve-landscape in Is 9-%9 die R1ch g R waz-Ze~i u: Wajld~ lMandz Former chancellor Kohl, riding a graph of plummeting popularity and trying to bounce back.</page><page sequence="13">THE NORMALISTIC SUBJECT AND ITS CURVES 59 its large-scale totality, then normalistic subjectivity stands out as a phenomenon that is "stretched out on curves" and whose subjective fates generate themselves on the basis of occurrences of the curve- landscape (vertical start, upswing, turning point, tug, downhill run, hard or soft landing, roller coaster, downward spiral, crash, normalization, and so on). All of these occurrences or fates can be related interdis- cursively not merely to economics, but also, in a like manner, to sociocultural and especially psychological normal-fields (i.e., personal growth). Thus, this type of normalistic subjectivity lives in its own curve-landscape, which serves as a field for orienteering, exploration, and experience-even as a complete living space and world. In Hei- degger, this space is called "care" [Sorge] in its ahistorical and anthro- pological abstraction. In my study, I have assumed that one would have to emphasize the connotation "welfare" [Fiirsorge] to find again the topicality and historicity of normalism.15 When one does this, the phenomenon can even be described somewhat more precisely-as I likewise attempt to do here by way of the curve-landscape. In today's print and electronic visual media, the economic curve- landscapes are arranged with the greatest frequency, exposure, and technical differentiation. On the basis of my research, I would like to venture the thesis that this supposed esoteric art of the "analysts" revolves predominantly around curve-landscapes: to first simulate the most plausible prognostic corridors of a medium-term normal growth and, second, to find out (likewise prognostically) the units with the strongest supernormal growth. Third, the analysts should naturally serve as an early warning system against risks of denor- malization. In this respect, we are dealing with correctly determining the location of the gradient of the medium-term normal growth, together with the latitude of its normal corridor for fluctuations up- ward and downward, so that the amplitudes and patterns of move- ment of the normal endless growing snake can be differentiated from denormalizing deflections. For this purpose, an always more differ- entiated dispositive serves the field of average growth curves, which are based on different-sized time windows. The fundamental dead-end of these dispositives lies in the fact that exponential growth breaks out from the normal snake of growth toward the top; therefore, it would have to trigger an alarm of denormalization-but instead this action must be ritually celebrated with a popping champagne cork.</page><page sequence="14">60 JORGEN LINK In my view, I must stress that such economic curve-landscapes al- ways already exceed the special knowledge of a special discourse and convey numerous interdiscursive, and as a rule, collective-symbolic connotations, which then also function very similarly in other fields like social, psychic, and everyday behavior. Below I have summa- rized the typical collective-symbolic denotations and connotations of today's curve-landscapes. Concerning noneconomic normalistic curve-landscapes, which are the most interesting under my subject-theoretical premises, I can only briefly discuss here a few examples. The demographic curve- landscapes belong to the oldest and radiate an appeal of power for application still today-above all those of identification and coun- teridentification, especially in the field of mass migrations. In the individual field, the "figure" [Linie] delivers one of the most impor- tant examples of normalistic self-regulation: On the basis of standard and limiting values like "normal weight" and "ideal weight," the ,Schleppern" Kampf angsagt RQckgang der Asylbewerberzah reicht Regierung nicht ONN ap)D er t Rck~ latg der Asy bwer ber uhlen am, %Pro 14ent als Fde wer schirfern Gmestre a+ ImnssrtStu~e oetat der:ndaomte- untang n&amp; .s lif.ht Selblstb t der Ah-m nahme vow mr.onedi-ch uber w Ow auf rund 14M n so die Bewer- bomzb, Inoch zu hoch., *Wge der parlarnena- rAsche InanonStast~me* kretOr Lntter I M.

A large part of health and women's magazines serve this correspond- ing normal field and frequently through the deployment of info- graphics. In this case, it might be quite clear how far the effects of normalistic "objective facts" radiate out into the core of subjectivity (i.e., the feelings of self and self-worth). Recently, much work has been done on medical curve-landscapes in both a narrow and wider sense, including much already from the theoretical perspective of normalism.

These exhibitions of subjectivizing curves sought to illus- trate, for example, the positive effect of hygiene on infant mortality or on the reduction of epidemics.17 Rolf Parr shows how fever curves in literature and television series have become the basis of modern nar- ratives and myths.1' The use of the motif of the fever curve in Thomas Mann's novel, The Magic Mountain, is exemplary for the ambiva- lence of the upper limit of normality and of supernormality between positive increases of intensity (also of affects and "nerves") and the denormalizing maelstrom of addiction and morbidness.

Such curve landscapes serve normalistic subjects as a means of orien- teer-ing, whereby they weigh a heightened intensity against the risks of denormalization. They can also draw up individual calculations of the positive exploration of limits of normality or in-suring adjusting. For the historically informed discourse analyst, it is always again odd to see how much the same culture-which has achieved "atom- ization" and "anonymization" through statistical mass distributions, average calculations, and large-scale trends-strives to forcibly re- subjectivize its subjectless breakthroughs. In this way, the dressing up of curves with face portraits is in no way limited to the Bildzeitung. In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, there is a regular column called "Heads Behind the Curves," where the portrait of a manager is al- ways depicted next to the curve of his stock. The context between the curve and the portrait is developed in the text through substantial deployments of collective symbolism. If one grasps these infographic references en masse and in the average, my thesis might be plausi- ble that modern normalistic subjectivity cannot be divided from the respective individual life-curve of a person-be it explicitly tangi- ble in the media or implicitly integrated as a balance of optimism/ pessimism or winner/loser into an entirely new type of "inwardness." In the end, I must briefly state that the subjective character appeal of the normalistic curve-landscape can function within the framework of two ideal-typically discursive strategies in polar oppo- sition. This appeal can first be imperatively directed toward narrow normal values: that is, "authoritarian" (Adorno/Horkheimer), "re- pressive" (Marcuse), "other-directed" (Riesman), and "disciplining- training" (Foucault). Through this discursive strategy, the normal range is established as narrowly as possible and is protected against the risks of denormalization through both symbolically and prag- matically robust limits of normality. I am speaking in this case of "protonormalism." Thereby, the symbolic weighting of limits of nor- mality takes place through the articulation of prenormalistic ideolo- gies. like those of "natural law." The pragmatic emphasis on limits of normality takes place above all through the link with juridical normativism (excluding specific varieties of "abnormality" as "crim- inal" and confinement behind the walls of jail as real existing limits of normality) or with medical indications in the widest sense (excluding</page><page sequence="18">64 JURGEN LINK other varieties of "abnormality" as "intellectually or spiritually devi- ating" behind the walls of institutions). Hence, the more restricted the normal range becomes, the "wider" the respective field of "abnor- malities" must appear. From a purely theoretical perspective, the principle of constancy and continuity of the normal curve allows an exactly opposite dis- cursive strategy: If the transition between normality and abnormality is continuous, constant, and fluid, then the limits of normality could also be placed "outside" of the "middle" as widely as possible, and thereby the normal range would be spread out to the maximum. In this case, large parts of the protonormalistic "abnormal" allow them- selves to be completely integrated, while other parts can still be symbolically included in wide transition zones. A flexible structure for appealing to the subject corresponds to the strategy I call flexible- normalistic: The curve-landscape now serves not as an imperative, but rather as orienteering help for self-normalization. Hence, the sub- ject is not fixed on pregiven normal values, but rather it can attempt to profit from the game of statistical compensation. The clash be- tween both normalistic discursive strategies represents an important key to understanding the history of normalism, which I cannot ad- dress here. In rough summary, the flexible strategy in the leading Western countries after World War II could have reached cultural hegemony, even though protonormalism still continues to play a role (since about 2000, protonormalism appears to be playing a larger role again). Michel Foucault's concept of "normalization," which is indeed closely connected to "disciplining" and "training," corresponds pri- marily to protonormalism. In our infographs, both strategies reveal their difference through the opposition of either narrow or wide corridors for trends of normal growth, as well as between either distinct or blurred markings of the limits of normality. The first tactic is exemplified by linking threaten- ing exponential curves with enemy pictures as they usually appear in the immigration statistics of "rich" countries, for example. Specific types of "zero solutions" and "stop demands" (like "zero tolerance of criminality," "zero budget deficit," "zero diet," and "immigration stop," for example) are in general symptomatic for protonormalism, which theoretically remains a constant option for normalism in the future. Frequently, the symbolic opposite pair hard versus soft signals</page><page sequence="19">THE NORMALISTIC SUBJECT AND ITS CURVES 65 the opposition of both the normalistic main strategies of protonor- malism and of flexible normalism: typically protonormalism does not want to acknowledge discussions of soft drugs.19 Without doubt, one can no longer imagine the media without infographic images of curve-landscapes that already belong to its normality by the extent of their large number. Less banal is my thesis that these images must be characterized more precisely as "normalis- tic" insofar as we are dealing with socioculturally necessary "nour- ishment for the modern subject." Through this "nourishment," these subjects are produced and reproduced foremost normalistically so that they can culturally orient themselves and can pursue their own normalization (as it were) in a new variety of "inner direction" that Riesman did not anticipate. Those normal-fields that are currently leading in the curve-landscape are of high relevance for the syn- chronic and diachronic analysis of contemporary culture-just as the question of where (in each sector) the limits of normality are placed, how they are disputed, and which of the two normalistic strategies is thereby favored. The "normal images" of the curve-landscape are therefore always both the means and the result of the many-stranded processes of normalization-they are, in fact, "normalistic images." " ... .. ..

If one looks back to the previous German version of the "soil" symbol (the "soil of legality" [Rechtsboden] of 1848 as well as "Blood and Soil"), then this totally virtual "curve of the soil" represents something like a micrologi- cal cultural revolution. 4.

In front of me is a youth magazine-enti- tled "Life in Line" (2000)-from the Austrian province of Kairnten governed by Jorg Haider. In this magazine, Haider strongly avoids any explicit differentiation between "hard" and "soft" drugs; there is also no mention of a softening "plural- istic" standpoint. Above all, it is surely unnecessary to stress on this occasion that the difference between protonormalism and flexible normalism can be decided by mere preferences. Consequently, flexible work hours for many of those affected are supposedly less healthy than those that are fixed (i.e., protonormalistic!)-and whether euthanasia and genetic-technical engineering (i.e., the flexibilization of the beginning and end of life) can produce a happier human society remains to be seen.</page></plain_text>
