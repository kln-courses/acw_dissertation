FELDMAN Yeshiva University Annenberg Research Institute Fellow, 1988-89 ABSTRACT In his portrayal of Jacob, Josephus' main goals are apologetic, namely to win the favor of his Roman hosts, and to present the biblical narra- tive in a more interesting form. In depicting Jacob he walked a tightrope between adulation and denigration. On the one hand, as with his other biblical heroes, Josephus stresses Jacob's genealogy, appearance, wealth, and possession of the cardinal virtues (wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice) plus piety; on the other hand, because he apparently identi- fied Esau with Rome, his patron, he is careful not to stress the short- comings of Esau, Jacob's twin brother and bitter rival, or the strife between Jacob and Esau. Although, in general, he closely paraphrases the biblical text, he omits references that would be embarrassing and he seeks to arouse more sympathy for Esau. However, the scene in which Jacob and Esau are reconciled becomes in Josephus a central event and is narrated at great length. Indeed, Josephus, ever eager to diminish the tension between the brothers, claims that Esau approached Jacob with no thought of treachery. Moreover, aware that the Romans were sensi- tive to the great expansion of the Jewish population especially through proselytism, and that Jacob is the direct ancestor of the Jewish people, Josephus departs from the biblical text in order to avoid any indication that the Jews seek to convert others to Judaism or that the Jews will establish an independent state in the future. To make the narrative more appealing to his primary audience, which consisted of pagans, Josephus diminishes the role of God in several places, rationalizes miracles, and omits those passages that raise serious questions about the authorship and date of the revelation of the Torah. Furthermore, he introduces an element of suspense, increases the pathos, and employs romantic motifs such as arefrequentlyfound in Homer and in the Greek novels. 1. Introduction: Issues Fergus Millar1 has insightfully, if perhaps with some exaggera- tion, remarked that Josephus' Antiquities, beginning with creation * For short title list, see appended bibliography.

The entire first half of the Antiquities is devoted to a reinter- pretation of the biblical portion of that history. For that period the quintessential Jewish forefather is, without doubt, Jacob. This is evident from the Pentateuch, where not only more space is given to him than to the other patriarchs but also more pathos and suffering, thus prefiguring, it would seem, the history of the Jewish people. It is not a coincidence that of all the forefathers it is only Jacob who is given the alternate name Israel, by which the Jews are identified. Josephus' treatment of him-expansions, ab- breviations, and omissions-would thus seem to be an excellent litmus paper test of his attitude toward his Jewishness. In view of this, we shall have to explain the striking lack of importance of Jacob for Josephus.2 In particular, in view of Jacob's conflict, from birth itself, with his twin brother Esau, Josephus' interpretation of this struggle may shed light on his attitude toward non-Jews. And if, as we shall conjecture, Esau is already identified in Josephus' mind with Rome, we shall be in a position to judge the extent to which pro-Roman sentiments may have played a role in his depiction of the strife between Jacob and Esau. Furthermore, Josephus' treatment of the romantic scene of the wooing of Rachel may give us clues about the influence of Greek novelistic motifs upon his treatment of the Bible. 2. The Importance of Jacob for Josephus One measure of the importance of Jacob for Josephus is simply quantitative. Abraham is the major subject of 385 verses in the Pentateuch (Gen 11:26-25:18) and is the center of focus in 93 2 Jacob is also not important for pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities, which, though covering the period from the creation to the death of Saul, mentions (8.7) only one incident in Jacob's life, namely the story of the rape of Dinah. The author of this work is a presumed contemporary of Josephus: see "Prolegomenon" to M. R. James, The Biblical Antiquities of Philo (New York, 1971), pp. xxviii- xxxi. 102</page><page sequence="3">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN sections (the average section contains between four and five lines of text) in Niese's edition of Josephus (Antiquities 1.149-241), a ratio of 4.14 to 1. Joseph, by comparison, is the major subject of 386 verses in the Pentateuch (Gen 37:1-36; 39:1-48:22; 50:1-26) and is the center of focus in 167 sections in Josephus3 (2.9-167, 189-193, 198-200), a ratio of 2.31 to 1. Jacob is the major focus of 490 verses (Gen 25:19-34; 27:1-46; 28:1-22; 29:1-35; 30:1-43; 31:1-55; 32:1-32; 33:1-20; 34:1-31; 35:1-29; 36:1-43; 37:1-3; 32- 35; 42:1-2; 45:25-28; 46:1-26; 47:7-12; 28-31; 48:1-2; 49:1-33; 50:1-14) and of 113 sections in Josephus (1.257-258, 267-346; 2.1-8, 168-188, 194-197), a ratio of 4.34 to 1. Hence we see that quantitatively, at least, Jacob has been given somewhat less im- portance than Abraham and considerably less importance than Joseph in relation to the biblical account.4 As we shall see, Josephus' omissions are at least as significant as his additions. Moreover, if we examine the eulogies which Josephus appends upon the death of his principal characters, we see that Abraham (1.256) receives 14 words, Isaac (1.346) 27 words, Joseph (2.198) 33 words, Moses (4.328-331) 127 words, Joshua (5.118) 43 words, Samson (5.317) 52 words, Samuel (6.292-294) 86 words, Saul (6.343-350) 373 words,5 David (7.390-391) 109 words, Solomon (8.211) 22 words, and Elijah (9.182) 26 words. The encomium of Jacob (1.196) consists of a mere 19 words, again illustrating his relative lack of significance for Josephus as compared to his obvious importance in the Bible. It is, furthermore, not merely Josephus who seems to have had less interest in Jacob. Aside from the fragments of Alexander Polyhistor, who in the first century BCE quotes the Graeco-Jewish third century BCE historian Demetrius (Eusebius, Praeparatio 3 All references to Josephus, unless otherwise noted, are to the Antiquities. 4 Cf. Thomas W. Franxman, Genesis and the "Jewish Antiquities" of Flavius Josephus (Rome, 1979), p. 181, who comments on the "somewhat light and rapid handling" which Jacob receives from Josephus, in contrast to Josephus' treatment of Abraham and Joseph; but he does not detail his remark. The reason for the apparent interest of Josephus in Joseph, we may remark, would seem to be twofold: 1) romantic (which would appeal to his Hellenistic readers), especially the elaboration of the scene with Potiphar's wife; and 2) apologetic, since Joseph is an excellent answer to those who charged the Jews with being insignificant in world history and self-centered. 5 See my "Portrait of Saul," especially p. 52, for a discussion of the particular interest which Josephus had in Saul. 103</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW evangelica 9.21.1-19), the only reference to Jacob in extant pagan literature is in Pompeius Trogus (Justin, Historiae Philippicae 36, Epitome 2.3-5), who calls him by his alternate name "Israhel" and who makes him the successor of Abraham as king of Damascus. Polyhistor is obviously not well informed about Jacob, since he declares (presumably confusing Jacob's name "Israel" with the much later kingdom of Israel) that he had ten sons and divided his people into ten kingdoms. A similar lack of informa- tion is seen in the remark of Alexander Polyhistor's contemporary Apollonius Molon, in the first century BCE, that to Gelos (i.e., Isaac, whose name is derived from the Hebrew word for "laugh- ter," here translated into the Greek word for "laughter") were born twelve sons, whereas, of course, Isaac had only two sons. Apollonius here has quite obviously confused Isaac with Jacob, whose name he does not seem to have known. We may further note here that though the Emperor Julian in the fourth century has mixed feelings about the Jews, he deni- grates Jacob (Contra Galilaeos 209D-E), remarking (clearly in contradiction to the Pentateuch itself) that he was a slave first in Syria, then in Palestine, and in his old age in Egypt. In contrast to this diminution of his importance and even denigration by non-Jews, Jacob, in the book of Jubilees (19.15, 31), dating, it would seem, from the second century BCE,6 is said to have found favor not only with his mother Rebecca but also with his grandfather Abraham. Similarly, though we do not have any treatises as such about Jacob by Philo, it is clear from his many references to him how central and how praiseworthy Jacob was in Philo's thinking. He constantly refers (e.g., Legum allegoriae 3.30.93) to him as the "practicer" or trained seeker (&amp;aJKrTqt, De plantatione 21.90) or lover of virtue ((ptiLapToq, De somniis 1.8.45, Legum allegoriae 3.30.93), who overthrows the passions and wickedness (Legum allegoriae 3.68.190, De mutatione nominum 12.81).7 6 See the recent comprehensive discussion by Jonathan A. Goldstein, "The Date of the Book of Jubilees," PAAJR 50 (1983): 63-86, who concludes that the book dates from between the years 175 and 167 BCE and probably from between 169 and 167 BCE. 7 In Philo Jacob is not the learner, whose course is determined by what a person says, but the practicer, whose course is determined by the person himself (De congressu 13.70). His very name signifies learning ([tarOieaoS) and progress 104</page><page sequence="5">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN 3. Jacobs Qualities of Character Inasmuch as in the proem to his Antiquities (1.10) Josephus declares (1.5) that his work was undertaken in the belief that the whole Greek world would find it worthy of attention, and inas- much as he cites the translation of the Torah into Greek for King Ptolemy Philadelphus as a precedent for his work and as a justification for directing his treatise to Gentiles, it is clear that his work was indeed primarily designed, with apologetic intent, for a non-Jewish Greek audience. Nevertheless, he also seems to have had in mind a Jewish audience, presumably in the Diaspora, that could appreciate his Greek and would learn the lessons which he intended to offer (1.14).8 In fact, he specifically declares (1.5) that his treatise was undertaken in the belief that the whole Greek world would find it worthy of attention. As we see in Josephus' portraits of his other biblical characters,9 he stresses precisely those qualities of character which would appeal to this audience, although of course some of them would be important (7poK7onrg); and his new name, Israel, stands for perfection (T£Et66Tr1TOg) and expresses the vision of God (De ebrietate 20.82). He is a plain and simple man in the best sense (De plantatione 11.44 and Legum allegoriae 3.1.2). To Philo Jacob is the perfect athlete-surely a tremendous compliment in the eyes of the Greek readers of his day-of noble pursuits (De somniis 1.20.126), who has been drilled in the gymnastics of the soul (De mutatione nominum 12.81) and has been awarded prizes and crowns with virtue presiding (De migratione Abrahami 6.27). Even his immaturity is explained (since his mother Rebecca addresses him [Gen 27:43 in the Septuagint version] as "child" [T£Kvov]) as actually an indication of the kindly feeling suited to his tender age, one that is capable (repeating the athletic imagery) of winning the prizes that are offered to boys (De fuga et inventione 7.40). For further characterization of Jacob and an exhaustive list of passages in Philo illustrating these qualities see Francis H. Colson, "Index of Names," in Philo (Loeb Classical Library [London, 1962]), 10:336-348. 8 On Josephus' two audiences see my "Use, Authority," 1:470-471, sec. 2. 9 See my studies as follows: "Portrait of Noah"; "Hellenizations in Josephus' Jewish Antiquities: The Portrait of Abraham," in Louis H.

These qualities of what the Greeks termed ap£Til are, first, the external ones of good birth and handsome stature; second, the four cardinal virtues of character- wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice; and third, the spiritual attribute of piety to God and to family10 (the fifth of the cardinal virtues, to judge from Plato). " What strikes one when reading Josephus' account of Jacob is that he seems, for some reason which we shall try to fathom, to have walked a tightrope, as he did in his portrait of David,'2 between adulation and denigration.13 On the one hand, Josephus, as in the case of his other biblical heroes,14 stresses Jacob's genealogy, appearance, wealth, and possession of the cardinal virtues plus piety; on the other hand, he is careful not to stress the shortcomings of Esau, Jacob's twin brother and bitter rival, or the strife between Jacob and Esau. A great hero must be well-born. Indeed, the first of the thirty- six stages when praising a person, according to the Greek rhet- orician Theon,15 was to laud his ancestry. Thus, in the Hippias maior (285D), ascribed to Plato, we read that one of the particu- lar concerns of an "archaeology" (part of the title, of course, of Josephus' work) is the genealogies of men. Josephus' Greek audi- ence would have thought of the importance attached to genealogy in Homer, as for example in the scene where Glaucus meets Diomedes (Iliad 6.123-231) and where they first exchange gene- alogies before deciding whether to engage in battle. Likewise, they might have thought of the importance attached to gene- alogies in Herodotus (7.204), who makes a special point of tracing the family tree of King Leonidas of Sparta twenty generations 10 See "Portrait of Saul," p. 59. 1 Plato, Protagoras 349B: "Are wisdom and self-control and courage and justice and piety five names which denote the same thing?" 12 See my study, "Portrait of David." 13 Franxman, Genesis (above, n. 4), p. 211, recognizes that Jacob's character in Josephus, while not blackened, is far from idealized. Josephus' representation of Jacob, he concludes, is ambiguous and thus constitutes "a grand exception to any theory which would have Josephus too liberally glorify or idealize the historical personages appearing in his version of Genesis." Franxman, however, makes no attempt to explain this apparent exception to Josephus' treatment of biblical heroes. 14 See, e.g., "Portrait of Saul," pp. 59-93. 15 See Leonardus Spengel, Rhetores graeci (Leipzig, 1854), 2:60-130. 106</page><page sequence="7">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN back to Heracles. Similarly, the twins Romulus and Remus, who were the founding fathers of Rome in much the same way as Jacob was for the Israelites (like Jacob, Romulus is the epony- mous founder), are described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, whose Roman Antiquities bears a title similar to that of Josephus' Jewish Antiquities and is likewise in twenty books,16 as men "born of royal race and looked upon as offspring of the gods." Josephus himself-in extrabiblical additions, as I have noted'7- commends Rebecca (1.247), Amram (2.210), Korah (4.14), Aaron (4.26), Gideon (5.213), Jephthah (5.257), Samson (5.276), Saul (6.45), Shallum (10.59), Gedaliah (10.155), and Mordecai (11.185) for their good birth. If indeed, as we shall see, there are salient novelistic themes in Josephus' version, one of them is the promin- ence given to genealogy, which, as Schmeling18 has remarked, is 16 Cf. my Josephus and Modern Scholarship (Berlin, 1984), pp. 407-408. As additional parallels between Josephus and Dionysius in their accounts of the twins Esau and Jacob as against Romulus and Remus, we may note that just as Josephus exalts the ancestry of the Jews, Dionysius seeks to glorify Rome by pointing to its noble ancestry, and just as the twins Jacob and Esau had a dispute, so Romulus was said to have had a dispute with Remus in which he likewise gained the upper hand through deceit and treachery. A clue, however, that Josephus is not merely repeating motifs from Dionysius but is proceeding selec- tively and independently may be seen in the fact that although Dionysius (1.80.2) speaks of the division of the forces of Romulus and Remus into three bands parallel to Jacob's division (Gen 33:2) of his forces into three groups, Josephus '(1.335) says nothing about the threefold division. Furthermore, we find that Dionysius, aware that Romulus' deceit in the contest of augury with his brother cast doubt on Romulus' character, seeks to vindicate him by suggesting (1.86.3) that "possibly Heaven (6 06eq) was thus directing him." Josephus, however, who might have been expected to save Jacob's reputation similarly by suggesting that he had been divinely directed, does not do so but instead (1.269) makes Rebecca the guiding force inspiring his stratagem. Again, the scene in which Esau has been defrauded of the blessing (1.274-275) has a close parallel in the scene in which Remus has been deceived by Romulus in the contest of the omens (Dionysius, 1.86.3-4), but Esau's expression of disappointment (ntv0oc tygv icvi T sLtagapTiq, "he mourned at the deception," 1.275) is only partly paralleled by Dionysius' statement that Remus was indignant (ayavacKTEi) and complained bitterly at being interrupted (6etva T oteTrat, &amp;x 6 tqpTr-nlvo;). We may suggest that perhaps this last word should be emended to btrlaptnrluvoS and thus have it conform with the expression in Josephus. 17 See my "Use, Authority," p. 486, and "Portrait of Saul," pp. 59-62. 18 Gareth L. Schmeling, Xenophon of Ephesus (Boston, 1980), p. 21. He notes that this is true for the novels by Xenophon of Ephesus, as well as in the tale of 107</page><page sequence="8">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the first thing in the author's mind as he begins his novel. Simi- larly, when Jacob first meets Rachel, he gives his genealogy at some length (1.288-290), in a scene reminiscent of Glaucus and Diomedes (Iliad 6.123-231), whereas in Genesis (29:12) we read simply that Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was Rebecca's son. Likewise, in an extrabiblical addition, when Laban asks Jacob why he had left his parents at a time when they needed his care, Jacob replies (1.294-296) at length, telling him not only the story of his life but also mention- ing that their grandfathers were brothers. A second quality of the great hero is that he should be physi- cally attractive. We are reminded of that remarkable passage in Plato's Republic (7.535A 11-12) that a philosopher, if at all possible, should be handsome.'9 Thus, when Pharaoh's daughter Thermuthis first beholds the infant Moses, Josephus (2.224) says that she was enchanted by his size and beauty (K}XXou)). In the case of Jacob, Josephus does not, to be sure, comment on his beauty, but he does remark on the beauty of his sons, and hence indirectly on Jacob's own handsomeness, when he has Joseph (2.98) declare to his brothers that he does not believe that they are all brothers, since it is impossible for any commoner to have reared sons "with figures ([top(pa6) so distinguished (£7ntipavci) when even kings found it hard to raise the like."20 A third quality of a great hero, such as Oedipus, is that he should be wealthy. Indeed, one of the stock anti-Semitic charges against the Jews was that they were a nation of beggars.21 Thus it is not surprising that in his final summary of David's virtues, for example, Josephus (7.391), in an extrabiblical addition, boasts that he left behind such wealth as no other king, whether of the Hebrews or of other nations, ever did. He reiterates this when he declares (Jewish War 1.61; so also Antiquities 13.249) that John Hyrcanus opened the tomb of David, "wealthiest of kings." Cupid and Psyche in Apuleius (Metamorphoses 4.28) and the anonymous novel Apollonius of Tyre. 19 See my "Portrait of Saul," pp. 62-63 for parallels in Josephus and elsewhere in Greek literature. 20 Similarly, in connection with the twins Romulus and Remus, Plutarch (Romulus 3.3) remarks that they were more than human in size and beauty (tEy70Et Kai KaXXU). 21 See Martial 12.57.1-14; Juvenal 3.10-16, 296; 6.542-547; cf. Lysimachus (Josephus, Against Apion 1.305). 108</page><page sequence="9">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN Hence Josephus stresses Jacob's prosperity, as we can see from his remark (2.7), omitted from his biblical source (Gen 37:1), that "it befell to Jacob to reach a degree of prosperity (e68atltoviaq, 'good fortune, blessing, well-being, wealth') hardly attained by any man," and that "in riches (nkoo6Tc) he surpassed the inhabit- ants of the country." Moreover, through his interpretation of Joseph's dream, Jacob predicts that his son will have prosperity, employing the same word (ci)56atoviacv) which had been used to describe Jacob. That wealth was one of the outstanding achieve- ments of Jacob is clear from the fact that when God speaks to Amram, the father of Moses, to encourage him in the face of the terrible decrees of Pharaoh, he reminds him (2.214) that Jacob had become famous among an alien people for the height of that prosperity (Ed86atloviaq) "which he attained in his lifetime and which he left to his children." The hero must, of course, possess the cardinal virtues of wis- dom, courage, temperance, and justice-virtues which admirers of the Jews, such as Aristotle, Theophrastus, Megasthenes, and Varro, found in them, but which their detractors found wanting.22 As for wisdom, it is a prerequisite for a leader, as we see of course in Plato's Republic, but no less in the portrait of the ideal statesman, Pericles, in Thucydides, and in the description of Oedipus in Sophocles' plays. In numerous places23 Josephus adds to the biblical text in stressing the wisdom of Jewish leaders; and this is certainly true of Jacob. In particular, Josephus, in an addition to the biblical text (2.15), singles out the fact that Jacob grasped the significance of Joseph's dream and sagely (aeTra cyoqpia) and unerringly (ouK acKO6tncW , "not by chance") divined its import. Somewhat later (2.17) Josephus reiterates that Jacob shrewdly (oDuK aouverToq, "not without understanding, cleverly, with discernment, clairvoyantly") interpreted the vision. More- over, Jacob (2.194) is said to have the wisdom of a prophet in his prediction as to how each of his son's descendants was destined to find a habitation in Canaan. Likewise, the quality of clever 22 See my "Philo-Semitism among Ancient Intellectuals," Tradition 1 (1958- 59): 27-39; my "Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World," in David Berger, ed., History and Hate: The Dimensions of Anti-Semitism (Philadelphia, 1986), pp. 15- 42; and my "Pro-Jewish Intimations in Anti-Jewish Remarks Cited in Josephus' Against Apion, JQR 78 (1987-88): 219-228. 23 See my "Abraham the Greek Philosopher," "Josephus as an Apologist," "Portrait of Saul," and "Portrait of David." 109</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW understanding (65tvoi o)vtevat) in Jacob's sons is noted in an extrabiblical addition (2.7).24 The virtue of courage and skill in battle is stressed by Josephus in a number of additions to the biblical narrative,25 especially since the Jews had been charged with cowardice by such Jew- baiters as Apollonius Molon (Against Apion 2.148), and since Josephus himself had been subjected to this charge (War 3.358). Moreover, as a military general himself in the Jewish war against the Romans, Josephus was particularly interested in military details and consequently often adds data not found in his biblical 26 source.2 In Josephus' portrayal of Jacob's courage, we may note a striking parallel between Isaac's prayer for Jacob in Josephus (1.273) that God should make him a terror to his foes ((po3ppov . . . Xpoig) and a treasure and delight (KeXaptoGievov) to his friends, and Hector's prayer for his son Astyanax (Homer, Iliad 6.476-481) that he may be distinguished among the Trojans and that his mother may rejoice (xapci`, from the same root as Josephus' word KeXaptio,evov) in her soul. This description in Josephus is particularly close to the ideal promulgated by Simonides, as quoted in Plato's Republic 1.332D), namely that justice consists of helping one's friends and harming one's ene- 24 Philo also, as would be expected in an admirer of Plato, stresses the wisdom of Jacob. Thus, in his De congressu 18.99 we hear of Jacob's supremacy in reason, since it is the feeling of gratefulness to God arising from reason and intelligence that prompts the Man of Practice (aoKr1TcK6o) to be generous in giving tithes (Gen 28:22). Elsewhere (De ebrietate 12.48) Philo refers to Jacob as the "practicer of wisdom" (ooqpiag &amp;acKrqTS) and (Quod deterius potiori insidiari soleat 2.3) as the earnest seeker of knowledge who is at war with ignorance. He represents (De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini 24.81) the fire of reason which subdues passion, as personified by Esau. His quality of wisdom is apparently so widely recognized that he can be referred to without even being named (De virtutibus 40.223) as "the wise man." Indeed, he is cited (De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini 11.48) as the "all-wise father" who trains his sons in wisdom so that they are not dazzled by Pharaoh's lavish pomp and splendor. Philo (De fuga et inventione 9.52) praises Jacob for going to the house of wisdom (oo(piaS), namely the home of Bethuel, to find a bride. Philo's Jacob (Legum allegoriae 3.63.179) is depicted as being even wiser than Joseph in that he teaches Joseph that the foods which nourish the soul are various forms of knowledge and that they are bestowed not by bodily sense but by God. 25 See my "Use, Authority," pp. 490-491; and my "Portrait of Saul," pp. 66-79. 26 E.g., 3.53, 3.289, 4.90-92, 5.5, 5.28, 5.46, 5.66, 5.157, 5.161, 5.206, 6.363, 7.142, 7.236, 9.221, 10.132. 110</page><page sequence="11">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN mies. Furthermore, Josephus (1.284) significantly omits Jacob's fear (Gen 28:17) after his dream about the angels going up and down a ladder; in Josephus Jacob is "overjoyed" (n7epitapig) at these visions and promises. Moreover, Josephus (1.335) presents Jacob as a military man, as we see, for example, in the way Jacob separates himself from his wives so that they may watch the battle from afar, in a manner reminiscent of the scene in Homer's Iliad, Book 3. Fur- thermore, whereas the Bible (Gen 32:4, 8-9) states merely that Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau and then divided the people who were with him so that if Esau should smite one band the other band might be able to escape, Josephus (1.325, 328) adds emphasis to the biblical account by depicting him as a military strategist and a master of reconnaissance techniques. He does this by noting that Jacob sent forward a party to obtain full and precise information and that he then sent one group in advance and bade the rest follow closely behind, so that if the advance guard were overpowered those in the rear might come to their aid.27 The quality of courage is also singled out in Jacob's children, who are termed (2.7) courageous (eiOVuXot) for their manual labor and endurance of toil and who are consequently the object of envy and admiration. It would seem that Josephus detracts from Jacob's courage by imputing fear to him (2.19), as does the rabbinic aggadah (Targum Ps.-Jonathan on Gen 37:13, Sefer ha- yashar 147), as a motive for sending Joseph to his brothers. But he seems to feel that unlike Scripture he has to give a good reason for sending Joseph, and so he explains, as do the rabbis, that Jacob was apprehensive, presumably because the Hivites might come and kill them for having killed Hamor and Shechem and the inhabitants of their city. Connected with this quality of courage, the great hero must show prowess.28 Hence Josephus (1.332) emphasizes Jacob's great 27 A similar portrayal of Moses as a skilled general may be seen in Josephus' extrabiblical descriptions of his organization of his army against the Amalekites (3.47), of his strategy (3.42) in attacking them at the outset before they were too strong, of his preparations for the battle (3.50), and of his ability to lead a good retreat (4.9). 28 So also Philo (De sobrietate 13.65) declares that Jacob exercised himself to master the life of labor and praises him (De somniis 1.20.120-121) for the practice of toil and endurance. Jacob, says Philo (De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini 36.120), is 11</page><page sequence="12">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW achievement of strength in overcoming the angel; indeed, Josephus adds that the angel bids him rejoice in his achievement and not to imagine that it was a puny (ttIKp6v) adversary whom he had mastered. Furthermore, whereas in the Bible (Gen 32:27) it is Jacob who demands that the angel bless him, in Josephus (1.332) it is the angel who takes the initiative to bless him. Likewise, the Bible (Gen 32:30) declares that the angel, after Jacob had wrestled with him, blessed Jacob without indicating the contents of the blessing, whereas in Josephus (1.332) the angel assures him that his race will never be extinguished and that no mortal man will surpass him in strength (iyXDoq). Another of the cardinal virtues is moderation; and Josephus, in extrabiblical additions, stresses that the biblical heroes possessed this quality.29 So also in the case of Jacob, although in the Bible (Gen 30:2) Jacob loses his temper in his anger against Rachel when she tells him to give her children or let her die; Josephus (1.305) omits this show of anger completely.30 Justice is the crown of the cardinal virtues in Plato's Republic, and is likewise stressed in the biblical heroes by Josephus in many extrabiblical additions.31 Indeed, when Nehemiah (11.169) ad- dresses the people in Jerusalem, he emphasizes that God cherishes the memory of the forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that it is because of their righteousness (6tKatoovrSvq, "justice") that he does not give up his providential care for the Jews. Connected with the attribute of justice are the attributes of hu- the symbol of labor (n6vou) and progress (npoKonrfq). In contrast, Esau (De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini 24.81) is the bad man who, when he sees the props on which he rests conquered and robbed of strength by the reason which corrects them, must in natural consequence find the bonds loosened which knit his strength together. 29 See for example my "Portrait of Saul," pp. 79-82. 30 Philo (De Congressu 6.24) ascribes this quality of moderation to Jacob, noting that he was unflagging in self-discipline (aicKrlctv). Indeed De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini (4.17-18; cf. De congressu 31.175-176), he says that Jacob is so named for his discipline, as Esau is for his folly. In fact, Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.168) actually derives the name Edom from "flame-colored" or "earthy" and says that the name was given to him because he was intemperate and unrestrained in character. 31 See my "Portrait of Saul" and my "Portrait of David." 112</page><page sequence="13">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN manity32 and generosity.33 Indeed, Jacob shows his generosity when he sends (1.329) as a gift to his brother Esau a multitude of animals that would be treasured on account of their rarity. More- over, Jacob, we are told (2.195), lavished praises upon his son Joseph for not bearing any malice against his brothers and indeed for being generous (XprroT6) to them in loading them with presents, "such as some would not have given even to requite their benefactors." Also connected with the virtue of justice is the responsibility to be honest.34 Thus Judah, in his appeal to Joseph (2.149) to show pity to their father's old age, declares that Jacob is an honest (Xprict6q) man, undeserving of his present suffering. As the fifth of the cardinal virtues, piety is often stressed by Josephus in his characterization of biblical figures.35 In the case of Jacob, although Josephus' encomium of him is extremely brief (only nineteen words), especially as compared with Saul (6.343- 350), it is precisely his piety (eoepe3tla) that is singled out (2.196) as a virtue in which Jacob was not inferior to any of his ancestors. In particular, Jacob's faith in God is shown when, in contrast to the Bible's statement (Gen 45:26) that Jacob did not believe his sons when they told him that Joseph was still alive and was ruler over all of Egypt, Josephus' Jacob (2.169) in his piety deems none of these reports incredible, since he reflects on God's mighty power and benevolence toward him.36 32 Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.165) contrasts the humanity and civilized (aoTTioq) character of Jacob with the inhumanity and unsocial attitude of Esau. 33 Note, in particular, the generosity of Joshua (5.48), the magnanimity of the Israelites to the Benjaminites (5.167), the generosity of Boaz (5.330), the gen- erosity, magnanimity, and unselfishness of David (6.317, 6.323, 7.322), and the magnanimity of Solomon (8.175), as well as the generosity and unselfishness built into the Jewish law forbidding interference with wayfarers who wish to take their fill of the autumn fruits (4.234-239). As for generosity, see Joseph Amstutz, A7r6ZrrTQ: Eine begriffsgeschichtliche Studie zum jiidisch-christlichen Griechisch (Bonn, 1968), pp. 42-43, on the juxtaposition of &amp;n'R6xkt and 6EyakoWvzXia. He concludes that the former stresses the spontaneity of the gift. 34 See my essay, "Portrait of David." 35 See my "Portrait of Saul." 36 Likewise Philo (Legum allegoriae 3.63.180) has Jacob very piously declare to Rachel, when the latter complains about her childlessness, that only God has the power to open the wombs of souls. Furthermore, Philo depicts Jacob (De somniis 1.26.163), who has discerned the kindness of God, as offering a prayer worthy of the utmost admiration. 113</page><page sequence="14">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 4. The Alleged Defects in Jacob's Character Inasmuch as Jacob is so closely identified with the Jewish people, his very name having been changed to "Israel," Josephus takes great pains to reply to those who had criticized him for his deceitfulness. In this connection, we should recall how strongly the Romans, Josephus' primary audience, felt about deceit, as we can see, for example, in Livy's disdain (1.27-28) for the Alban leader Mettius Fufetius, who broke the treaty with Rome, and for the Carthaginians, who were known for their faithlessness (fides punica). Indeed, at the very beginning of his account of Jacob, Josephus (1.258) gives the etymology of Esau; but while he does mention that Jacob held his twin brother Esau by the heel, he omits the biblical etymology of Jacob that follows (Gen 25:26), that is, that his name means "supplanter." Franxman37 is puzzled about why Josephus chooses to explain the etymology of the less intelligible name Esau, and leaves aside the more important and more significant name Jacob. The explanation would seem to be that it was embarrassing to look upon the ancestor of the Jewish people as aggressive from his very birth. The next major event in Jacob's life, the purchase of Esau's birthright (Gen 25:29-34), is postponed in Josephus (2.1-3) until after his account of the death of Isaac and Rebecca, perhaps because he is proceeding thematically and is at this point about to take up the list of Esau's descendants. The scene of Jacob's deception of his father in order to obtain his blessing is a particularly troublesome one for the apologist. On the one hand, Josephus (1.270) does not suppress the remark that Jacob was fearful lest his guile (KaKoopycov) be discovered. On the other hand, Josephus (1.271) omits the embarrassing question, "How is it that thou hast found it [i.e., the venison] so quickly, my son?" He likewise omits Isaac's embarrassing requests (Gen 27:21) that Jacob come near so that Isaac might feel him to see whether he really is Esau, as he had claimed, and so that he might kiss him. Moreover, Josephus (1.271) omits Jacob's in- criminating statement, "I am Esau thy first-born." Indeed, in Josephus (2.173) God himself justifies Jacob's theft of the bless- ing, saying that it was he who had given the princedom to him 37 Franxman, Genesis (above, no. 4), p. 177. 114</page><page sequence="15">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN rather than to Esau. Nevertheless, Josephus postpones the state- ment to a later context than the one where it appears in Genesis, presumably because he feels self-conscious about having God justify the theft on the spot and prefers to defend it ex post facto. Moreover, Josephus (1.269) transfers the blame for the decep- tion completely to Rebecca, even though in general he drastically reduces the role of Rebecca.38 Thus, while the Bible (Gen 27:8) merely quotes Rebecca as saying, "And now, my son, obey my voice in that which I command thee," Josephus emphatically states that it was Rebecca who, determined to invoke God's favor upon Jacob even in defiance of Isaac's intent, took the initiative to bid Jacob slaughter some kids and prepare a meal for his father. It is true that the Hebrew original (Gen 27:8) has Rebecca telling Jacob, "And now, my son, obey my voice in that which I command thee"; but Josephus is much more emphatic, declaring (1.269) that "Jacob obeyed his mother, taking all his instructions from her," even though it is Jacob (1.269) rather than Rebecca (Gen 27:9) who actually prepares the meal for Isaac, and even though it is Jacob (1.270) rather than Rebecca (Gen 27:16) who puts the skins of the kids upon his hands. At a later point, where Jacob recounts to Laban the story of how he had received the blessing, he states (1.295) that Esau was defrauded (6tiflapTc, "failed to attain, had no success") of his father's blessings through his mother's artifice (oo(piq, "cleverness"). Indeed, Josephus sig- nificantly omits Jacob's statement (Gen 27:12) which stresses his deception: "Peradventure my father will find me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver." Moreover, there is less elaboration of the deception in Josephus (the scene has been reduced from 155 words in the original to 88 words in Josephus). Thus Jacob covers only his arm, and not as in the Bible, his hands and neck, with the skin of a goat; he is not dressed, as he is in the Bible (Gen 27:15), in Esau's best garments, and the menu is not underscored by being described (Gen 27:17) as savory. There was hardly much deception at all, according to 38 See Franxman, Genesis, p. 182, who notes, for example, that Rebecca does not overhear the conversation between Isaac and Esau (Gen 27:5), much less tell Jacob about it. On Josephus' portrait of Rebecca see now James L. Bailey, "Josephus' Portrayal of the Matriarchs," in Louis H. Feldman and Gohei Hata, eds., Josephus, Judaism, and Christianity (Detroit, 1987), pp. 154-179, especially 161-165, 173-174. 115</page><page sequence="16">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Josephus (1.270), inasmuch as Jacob, being Esau's twin, resembled him in all else except hairiness.39 The Septuagint (Gen 27:38) records that Isaac was deeply affected (KaTavuXO0vTog, "be sorely pricked, be bewildered, be stunned") when Esau wept upon dis- covering that Jacob had usurped his blessing; but this reaction is omitted in Josephus (1.275), who says merely that Isaac was moved (&amp;aO6aocvoS, "be vexed, be grieved") by Esau's tears. Finally, presumably in order not to put too much stress on the theme of the younger obtaining the blessing in lieu of the older, Josephus (2.195) omits the account of Jacob's blessing of Joseph's sons, where according to Genesis (48:14-19), Jacob knowingly placed his right hand upon the younger, Ephraim, and his left hand upon the older, Manasseh. Another apparent defect in Jacob's character is his favoritism toward Rachel and his hatred toward his other wife, Leah. This hatred is apparent in the language of the Hebrew text and of the Septuagint (Gen 29:31: ;nK LV, "hated," Septuagint CptLUCTo, "was hated"). Josephus (1.303) says nothing of Jacob's hatred for Leah, but rather accentuates the positive, namely his passion (`pc0o) for Rachel. And when a child is born to Leah, the Bible (Gen 29:32) quotes her as saying that now her husband will love her; the Septuagint likewise uses the future tense (ayarInjcl ), expressing Leah's hope. Josephus' Jacob, on the other hand, is more appreciative of Leah, and after the birth of Reuben we are told (1.304) that he was drawn back to her (nEoTpajltCvou, "turned around, turned back"). It is also significant that Josephus (1.309) omits Jacob's trickery with the speckled and spotted lambs and goats (Gen 30:32-43), 39 Philo (De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini 17.64, Quod Deus immutabilis sit 20.92) goes even further than Josephus in justifying Jacob's deception of Isaac, stressing the truth of Jacob's reply, when asked by his father how he was able to find venison so quickly: "It is what the Lord God set before me" (Gen 27:20). Even when Jacob tells his father, "I am Esau, thy first-born," Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.206) remarks that he will merely seem to be a deceiver, whereas actually he is not to be thought to be connected with any evil. Philo then asks: "What dispensation is better than when one does not ascribe good things and virtues to those who wish to live shamefully and disgracefully?" Indeed, he completely justifies the acquisition of the blessing by Jacob (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.229) on the ground that Jacob did not take Esau's blessing but rather one that was suitable to himself, since Esau was inscribed to be among the slaves whereas Jacob was inscribed to be among the masters. 116</page><page sequence="17">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN even though he might have justified such an act of revenge in view of what Laban had done to him.40 He likewise omits both Laban's charges (Gen 31:20 and 31:26) and those of his sons (Gen 31:1-2) that Jacob had outwitted them. On the contrary, Josephus emphasizes the effusive craftiness of Laban in his promise to Jacob of gifts and honors and every kindness, both in the name of their ancestors and also for his mother's sake (1.297; cf. Gen 29:19). He similarly cites Laban's enthusiastic delight that Jacob wished to marry his daughter Rachel (1.299; cf. Gen 29:19). Josephus shifts the charge of deceit from Jacob to Laban when he adds (1.301) that Laban brought Leah to Jacob's chamber while Jacob was completely unaware of what Laban was doing. That Josephus is aware of the charge of trickery is clear from his insertion of an apology by Jacob (1.318), not found in his biblical source (Gen 31:31), to the effect that Laban ought to be grateful to him for having kept and multiplied his cattle, and that it is unreasonable of him to be angry with Jacob for the small portion of them that he took with him. Josephus, in his eagerness to avoid antagonizing Gentile read- ers, is careful to stress (1.340) that Simeon and Levi, in mas- sacring the Shechemites, acted without their father Jacob's per- mission. The Bible says nothing at this point about Jacob's attitude on this subject, although afterwards Jacob does say (Gen 34:30) that they have made him odious to the inhabitants of the land; and still later (Gen 49:5-7) Jacob expresses indignation at their violent deed. Indeed, Josephus uses strong language in stating (1.341) that Jacob was aghast (sKnray7vzt) at the enormity of their acts and indignant (Xakneativovtn) at his sons. On the other hand, Philo (De migratione Abrahami 39.224), while ig- noring the circumcision of the Shechemites, praises Simeon and Levi as "hearers and pupils of sound sense." The Book of Jubilees (30:3), while also avoiding the circumcision motif and similarly avoiding any indication of negotiation with the Shechemites, stresses the justifiable anger of Jacob and his sons. In contrast to their precipitous action Jacob shows how reasonable he is by holding a council on the subject of Hamor's request for the hand of Dinah (1.338). 40 We may note that both Philo (De plantatione 26.110-111, De somniis 1.35.202) and Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities (17.2-3) do mention this incident. 117</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW One of the charges that might have been made against Jacob was that he showed favoritism toward his son Joseph. Josephus answers this charge by giving as the reason why Jacob loved Joseph so much not that he was the son of his old age (Gen 37:3) but rather (2.9) that he was exceptionally handsome and pos- sessed virtuous qualities of soul (8ta ZUXcSi apEri/v) and had profound understanding ((ppoviEt).41 In order not to emphasize the unfairness of Jacob's favoritism toward Joseph, Josephus (2.9) omits the notorious fact that Jacob had made a coat of many colors for him (Gen 37:3). Again, while the Bible (Gen 37:10) says that Jacob rebuked Joseph when told of the dream predicting Joseph's ascendancy over his brothers, Josephus (2.15) says that he was delighted, "grasping in his mind what it predicted and sagely and unerringly divining its import." In a world which placed great store in the significance of dreams this is much more acceptable than the biblical Jacob's rebuke of Joseph and his "wait-and-see" attitude.42 5. Josephus' Treatment of Esau Josephus was confronted with a dilemma when he came to the question of how to treat the figure of Esau. On the one hand, there was a long-standing tradition, commencing with the Bible itself, denigrating him. Thus the Bible (Gen 25:27) quite obviously favors Jacob, the "plain" (on, Septuagint a`nTaozog, Targum Onkelos and Neofiti DS'UI, "perfect") man, dwelling in tents, in contrast to Esau the hunter, the man of the field. Josephus (1.258) omits this contrast completely, apparently because he seeks to walk a tightrope between degrading and uplifting both Jacob and Esau. But the prophet Malachi (1.2-3) quotes God explicitly as saying, "Jacob I loved, Esau I hated." The negative view of Esau is continued in the pseudepigraphic Book of Jubilees, dating apparently from the second century BCE, 41 The Targum of Onkelos, as well as the Samaritan Targum, translating 7: O'3PT not as "son of his old age" but as "wise" (cf. bQid 32b), likewise declare that Jacob loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, "for he was a wise son to him." Joseph is, in effect, the prototype of the Platonic philosopher-king who, as we have noted above, should, if at all possible, be handsome. 42 The midrash (GenR 84.12; cf. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliezer 38) also declares that Jacob saw, through his analysis of this dream, that Joseph would rule in the future. 118</page><page sequence="19">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN where we find his line condemned as the enemy of Israel (Jubilees 19:13-14), and where we are told (Jubilees 35:9-12) that even after his participation in Abraham's burial rites his mother Rebecca still considered his every thought and deed to be evil. In a Jewish society where literacy was prized,43 we are informed (Jubilees 19:14) that as the two youths grew up, Jacob learned to write but Esau did not. In Philo (De fuga et inventione 4.24) we have an outright denigration of Esau as the worse part of the soul, in contrast to Jacob who is said to represent the better part of the soul. Esau (4.24ff.), moreover, is both the inward and the outward enemy, the representative of folly (&amp;(ppoau6vrl), in contrast to Jacob's prudence ((pp6vrlotS) (De ebrietate 2.9-10).44 Indeed, it is Esau 43 Cf. Jubilees 11:16 and 12:27, which exalt Abraham's literacy. 44 Indeed, for Philo Esau is the prototype (7.39) of the person whose ignorance makes him disobedient, who nurses a grudge, who offers the baits of this mortal life-money, fame, pleasures, and the like-to destroy God. While (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.157) in Rebecca's womb Jacob is heavenly and worthy of the divine light, Esau is "earthy and corruptible and like darkness." Jacob's rule over Esau (ibid.) is explained as the law of nature which declares that good must rule over folly. Again and again (e.g., Quaestiones in Genesin 4.161-162, 220, 232; cf. De congressu 12.61-62) Philo identifies Esau with foolish ignorance and vice, un- bending, stiff-necked, evil, full of fictions and sugared, untamed, unrestrained, and undisciplined. A whole catalogue of undesirable qualities is ascribed to Esau (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.227): (he is envious, treacherous, self-contradictory, and quarrelsome in deeds, thoughts, and words. In Philo's view (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.197) Esau is by nature rash and bold, and paradoxically timid and cowardly. As an example of profligacy and indecency (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.199) Esau does not merit being called Rebecca's son; he and Jacob are brothers only in the sense that odd and even or ordered and disordered are related. He is the personification of evil (De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini 39.175), the votary (0taocitou, a member of a religious guild, as it were [Quod deterius potiori insidiari soleat 14.45], of wickedness), who seeks to substitute the stamp of vice for the image of virtue. Since Jacob represents good and Esau evil, it is best (De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini 2.4) that they be set apart from each other and no longer have the same habitation. While yet in the womb, God had declared (Legum allegoriae 3.29.88-89; cf. De congressu 23.129-130, 31.175-176) that Jacob was to be ruler, leader, and master, and that Esau was to be subject and slave. Esau (De congressu 23.129-130) follows after rustic grossness (aypotKiav, "state of being untrained," reminiscent of the Stoic idea that the bad man or fool is essentially 6ypotiKo). Philo (De virtutibus 38.209, Quaestiones in Genesin 4.218) justifies the lordship of Jacob over Esau by stating that it is actually more profitable for the foolish man (i.e., Esau) not to be free but rather to have wisdom (i.e., Jacob) as a mistress so as to curb his passions and expel his fever, as if he were a diseased 119</page><page sequence="20">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.238), rather than Jacob, who is termed deceitful. Even when Esau does something virtuous, as he does in showing filial piety by preparing a meal for his father, he is deserving of hatred because he does so with impure motive (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.221). Here he is compared with the despised sophists who do the same things as wise men. In fact, according to Philo (De virtutibus 38.208; cf. Quaestiones in Genesin 4.168), it is Jacob who was obedient to his parents and won such favor that God too joined in praising him, whereas Esau was actually disobedient, indulging in the pleasures of the belly and the lower parts, all his concern being to cause grief to his parents. In short (De virtutibus 38.210), his life is the clearest proof that to those who are unworthy of nobility, nobility is of no value. The extremely negative view of Esau is found in the New Testament (Hebrews 12.15-17), which speaks of "some fornicator or profane person like Esau" who found no place for repentance.45 Likewise, in the talmudic and midrashic traditions Esau, as Irit Aminoff concludes,46 served as a receptacle for every trait against which the Torah counsels. Indeed, the Palestinian Hama bar Hanina, in the middle of the third century (ExodR 21.7), names Samael, who is usually identified with Satan,47 the greatest of all person; for such a person servitude (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.236) is actually a boon, especially when he gets a master such as Jacob, who is virtuous. For further characteristics of Esau and an exhaustive list of passages in Philo illustrating them see Francis H. Colson, "Index of Names," in Philo, (Loeb Classical Library) 10:308-10. 45 It is truly ironic that despite the fact that Jacob is called Israel, the Church Fathers (e.g., Irenaeus, Against Heresies 4.21.2-3; Pseudo-Cyprian, De montibus Sina et Sion; Hippolytus, apud Jerome, Epistles 36 [= Migne, Patrologia Latina 22:460]) identified Esau as the Jew hated by God and supplanted by Jacob, who is regarded as the prototype of the Church and is beloved by God. Perhaps the rabbis' attempts to rehabilitate Esau are, to some degree, due to an effort to answer such attacks. 46 Irit Aminoff, The Figures of Esau and the Kingdom of Edom in Palestinian Midrashic-Talmudic Literature in the Tannaic and Amoraic Periods (Ph.D. diss., Melbourne University, 1981), p. 2. 47 Gershom Scholem, "Samael," Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1971), 14:720, notes, however, that in the Hebrew Enoch 14.2 Satan is distinguished from Samael. It is perhaps significant, nevertheless, that the identification of Samael with Esau's guardian angel is not made until the mid-third century. Cf. CantR 3.6, where the Palestinian R. Hama bar Hanina declares that Jacob says to Esau: "Your countenance resembles that of your guardian angel." 120</page><page sequence="21">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN the angels, as Esau's guardian angel. Samael is, indeed, later specifically identified as Mars, the red planet (presumably because of the equation Edom = red = Esau),48 and consequently as the guardian angel of Rome, Mars's alleged descendants. In a similar tone, after the Bar Kokhba rebellion (132-135 CE), Judah bar Ilai, who came from Galilee and who (bSanh 14a) was one of five rabbis ordained by Judah ben Bava at the cost of the latter's life at the time of the Hadrianic persecution, remarks (yTa'an 4.8, 68d; GenR 65.21), in commenting on the biblical passage "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau" (Gen 27:22): "The voice of Jacob cries out at what the hands of Esau did to him at Bethar" (the last stronghold of Bar Kokhba where he was besieged by the Romans). Even the fact that Rebecca took the special garments of Esau (which he had inherited from Adam by virtue of being the eldest son) and gave them to Jacob was justified by the rabbis (Targum Ps.-Jonathan on Gen 27:15) because, it was said, Esau was dis- dainful of them. And Esau's apparently laudable restraint in waiting until the days of mourning for Isaac were over before deciding to kill Jacob is explained (Ps.-Jonathan on Gen 27:41) by stating that his motive, far from being humanitarian, was intended to avoid the mistake Cain made in killing Abel while Adam was still alive, thus leaving enough time for Adam to beget Seth, who was able to acquire the inheritance in place of Cain. That Esau is the epitome of wickedness is manifest from the comparison made by the second-century R. Isaac (bSanh 39b) (who identifies the Obadiah of 1 Kings 18.3ff. with the prophet of that name) between Obadiah, who lived with two wicked people, Ahab and Jezebel, and did not follow their example, and Esau, who lived with two righteous people, Isaac and Rebecca, but did not learn from their good deeds. Furthermore, the second-century 48 Abraham Epstein, "The Beasts of the Four Kingdoms" [Hebrew], Beth Talmud 4 (1885): 173-177, notes the association of Edom, which means "red" in Hebrew, with Mars, the red planet. Another association was made through the fact that Mars was the alleged father of Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome. Gerson D. Cohen, "Esau as Symbol in Early Medieval Thought," in Alexander Altmann, ed., Jewish Medieval and Renaissance Studies (Cambridge, Mass., 1967), p. 21, n. 7, finds the suggestion farfetched that the name of Edom is derived from the Hebrew name for Mars; but the key point, we may suggest, is not that Edom is derived from the Hebrew name for Mars but that both are associated with the word "red." 121</page><page sequence="22">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW R. Eleazar actually attributes Isaac's blindness to looking at Esau too often (GenR 65.10). In the midrash (GenR 63.8) the third- century R. Abba bar Kahana, commenting on the fact that Esau was blood-red at birth, remarks that this was a sign of his future utterly bloodthirsty nature. We are even told (GenR 63.12-13) that on the very day of Abraham's death Esau committed three abominations-violation of a betrothed maiden, murder, and theft-and that these sins were responsible for the death of Abraham, who was supposed to live to be 180 years old like his son Isaac but died at 175 so that he would not have to see his grandson committing these three cardinal sins. R. Eleazar ben Azariah in the first century declares (GenR 65.5-7) that one beneficial aspect of Isaac's blindness was that it kept him in the house so that he did not have to go out in public and be ridiculed as the father of the wicked Esau. In his depiction of Esau Josephus was confronted with a di- lemma: if he praised him too highly, he would be detracting from the stature of Jacob, his rival; and if he denigrated him, he would be diminishing the respect for Rome, since, as we shall see, Esau had apparently already in Josephus' time become identified with Rome. We may note Josephus' adept handling of this matter already in his account of the birth of the twins. In the first place, even before their birth, Josephus (1.257) omits all mention of their struggle (Gen 25:22) within Rebecca's womb (the Hebrew, YY'lnll, indicates that they crushed one another).49 Furthermore, while the oracle, according to the Hebrew (Gen 25:23), declares that the 49 Rashi, following the midrash (GenR 63.6), derives the word from the root rl, "to run," and this is apparently the source of the Septuagint's translation, CYOKipTcoV, from the word meaning "spring, leap, bound." The more likely mean- ing is derived from the root 'Y1, as we see in Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, A Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1952), 14:6722; and Jacob Knaani, Thesaurus of the Hebrew Language [Hebrew] (Givatayim, 1982), 16:5588. It is interesting that we find an account in Apollodorus, whose work, Bibliotheca, dates from perhaps the first or second century CE, of twin sons, Acrisius and Proetus (2.2.1), who, like the biblical Jacob and Esau, quarreled with each other in the womb and who later, when grown up, waged war for the kingdom. Apollodorus uses the word Eo'TaGiaOov for "quarreled"; and we may guess that Josephus did not use such a term because of its association with oxTotS, "civil strife," of which Josephus had such a dim view because of the civil 122</page><page sequence="23">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN older shall serve (n7Y') the younger, and while the Septuagint likewise reads "will serve" (6ou,6ocst), Josephus (1.257) writes, in order to avoid the impression that the descendants of Esau, presumably here the Romans, are destined to be slaves to the Jews,50 that "he that to appearance was the lesser would excel (7npoTrpO£iEtv, "come before") the greater." Here Josephus fol- lows the import of the Septuagint, which reads that Jacob will 7T£npEcEt ("be above") Esau, rather than the Hebrew ynx' ("be stronger"), and thus avoids the embarrassing prophetic implica- tion that Rome will ultimately be militarily weaker than the Judaea which it had just defeated in a protracted war (66-74 CE). While the Bible (Gen 25:25) declares that Esau "came out ruddy (':~7K) all over like a hairy garment," and the Septuagint faith- fully renders this by saying that he came out "red, hairy all over like a skin" (7nit5pdKrg, o, o og , ca bopa, baoct6 ), and, similarly, Targum Onkelos renders it that he came out "red, like a hairy mantle all over," Josephus (1.258) speaks of Esau's hairiness but says nothing about his redness and nothing about the struggle between Jacob and Esau in the womb. In antiquity there was a general prejudice against ruddy or red- haired persons.51 Slaves apparently were said to have red hair, as we may see from the description of three of them in Roman comedies (Plautus, Asinaria 400, Pseudolus 1218; Terence, Phormio 51);52 and slaves often were named Rufus ("Red"). The strife in his own day involving the revolutionaries. On Josephus' possible knowl- edge of Apollodorus, see my "Portrait of Noah," pp. 44-45. 50 Targum Onkelos renders by the word 'l7tVtr, "will be subjected to." Moses Aberbach and Bernard Grossfeld, ed. and trans., Targum Onkelos to Genesis (Denver, 1982), p. 151, comment that Jewish national pride required that in the messianic future Rome should not only "serve" Judaea but that Rome should actually be subjugated to the Jews. Cf. Yehudah L. Groibart, "Edom and Rome" [Hebrew], in Chaim D.

We may note that in the Middle Ages Judas Iscariot is represented as having red hair. On hairiness as a mark of savagery see Ephraim A. Speiser, ed., Genesis (The Anchor Bible) (Garden City, NY, 1964), p. 196; and Bruce Vawter, On Genesis: A New Reading (London, 1977), p. 288. 52 To be sure, George E. Duckworth, The Nature of Roman Comedy: A Study in Popular Entertainment (Princeton, 1952), p. 89, asserts that there seems to be no good authority for the statement that slaves always wore red wigs. A clue, 123</page><page sequence="24">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW rabbis associated redness with the shedding of blood.53 Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.160), consistent with his posture of denigrating Esau, remarks that Esau's ruddy body and hairy hide were a sign of a savage man who raged furiously in the manner of a wild beast. That Josephus was aware of the connotation of redness may be seen in his rendering (6.164) of the passage (1 Sam 16:12) in which David is described as ruddy ('17X, the same word used to describe Esau). The Septuagint, here as in the case of Esau, renders the word by 7nulbdpKrg, that is, "fiery red"; but Josephus speaks of David's complexion as "golden" (xavO6q, "yellow with a tinge of red, fair").54 Josephus (1.258), aware of the connections of redness with bloodshed and apparently con- cerned not to imply that the descendants of Esau, the Romans, were slaves, totally omits Esau's redness and remarks merely that he was excessively hairy. Josephus' handling of Esau's sale of his birthright was likewise calculated to mitigate criticism of him. In the first place, as we have noted, he even postpones mentioning the incident until after the reconciliation between Jacob and Esau, because, we may conjecture, if he had mentioned it in its proper time frame this might have helped to build up a cumulative dossier of evidence that Esau was really unworthy of Isaac's blessing; he had such a low opinion of his birthright as to sell it. Josephus postpones mention of the sale until he comes to the death of Isaac, where- upon he explains the division of the inheritance. There is also further sympathy for Esau, because we are told (2.2) that he was still a lad (tnaig, "child"), whereas the Hebrew text gives no indication of his age. Moreover, while the Hebrew text (Gen 25:29) states that he was tired (1p2), Josephus uses a stronger word indicating that he was exhausted (nt6vou, implying "toil, however, to the fact that this was normally the case may be seen in Plautus' Captivi (648), where Philocrates, though a free young man, is described by his countryman as having "somewhat reddish hair" (subrufus), presumably because he had been disguised as a slave earlier in the play. 53 See Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (Philadelphia, 1928), 6:247, n. 13. 54 The word ,cavO6s is used by Josephus (2.2 and 3) with reference to the "tawny" pottage which Jacob gave to Esau in exchange for his rights as a first- born son. Hence in referring to David as b,avO6;, far from associating David with the Messiah who will overthrow the Roman Empire, Josephus, farfetched as it may seem, may be connecting David with Rome, which is said to be identified with Esau or Edom, as I indicate in my "Portrait of David." 124</page><page sequence="25">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN strain, exertion"). In the Hebrew text we are tempted to show disdain for Esau, who was ready to sell so precious a status as his birthright for some mere boiled pottage (7't]); but we have much more understanding for Josephus' Esau, since there the food is a dish of lentils of rich (a(p66pa, "especially") tawny hue, "which still further whetted his appetite." While in the Hebrew text (Gen 25:31) Jacob merely asks Esau to sell him the birthright, Josephus obviously arouses more sympathy for Esau, since he states expli- citly (2.3) that Jacob took advantage (%pr{lc5psvog) of Esau's famished state and forced (ilv6yKacE) him to sell it. Indeed, Josephus mentions Esau's hunger three times in this brief section, whereas the Hebrew text does not mention Esau's hunger at all. Hence we can easily justify the sale as being a matter of sheer survival for Esau. What is most striking is that Josephus says nothing (2.3) about Esau despising his birthright (Gen 25:34);55 instead, he uses the story to explain the etymology of the region of Idumaea, which he derives from Esau's nickname t17r (i.e., Edom), referring to the red color of the pottage for which Esau sold his birthright. Indeed, if, as we suggest, Esau was already in Josephus' time regarded as the ancestor of the Romans, Josephus is careful not to offend his Roman patrons by stating, for example (2.2), not that Esau sought to swallow ('St''WY7 [Gen 25:30], a hapax legomenon implying, at least in later Hebrew, voracious eating) the pottage but that he simply asked Jacob to give him some food (Tpoqpiv).56 In the Hebrew, the second half of the verse (25:34), as 55 We may note that Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.172) remarks that the literal meaning of Jacob's statement, "Sell me this day thy birthright," shows Jacob's greed in wishing to deprive Esau of his rights, but that the allegorical meaning, which Philo obviously prefers, is that an abundance of possessions brings about sin for a wicked man (i.e., someone like Esau) but is necessary for the righteous man alone. Elsewhere (Legum allegoriae 3.69.192-70.195) Philo justifies Jacob's acquisition of the birthright by noting that Esau had a servile character and that therefore the birthright and blessings were inappropriate for him, since he was sunk in boundless ignorance. Pseudo-Philo (in his Biblical Antiquities 32.5-6) comments not at all on the actual barter of the birthright. 56 So also the Septuagint (Gen 25:30) reads yesoov, that is, "taste." Likewise, Targum Onkelos reads "Give me now some of that red stuff to taste." In the talmudic period the root is used of feeding cattle. See Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, Dictionary, (above, n. 49) 5:2713; and Jacob Knaani, Thesaurus (Jerusalem, 1967 [above, n. 49]), 8:2488, though it is possible, of course, that the word acquired this connotation because of the negative association with Esau. 125</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Speiser57 notes, presents a staccato succession of five verbal forms which may perhaps (though the ancient and medieval commen- tators do not comment on it) serve to emphasize Esau's lack of manners and judgment (i.e., he ate, drank, rose up, went his way, and despised his birthright).58 Finally, the Hebrew text (Gen 25:34) says that Esau despised (T3'l) the birthright, and the Septuagint says that he held it cheap (cpaUXtcasv, "held of little value"); but presumably because he was careful not to denigrate Esau, all this is missing from Josephus' account.59 In his presentation of Esau's relationship with his father Isaac, Josephus likewise arouses more sympathy for Esau. The Bible (Gen 25:28) unabashedly admits that Isaac favored Esau because he loved to eat his venison; Josephus carefully omits this reason and declares simply that his father favored him especially (£1rnovb6Kct, "pursue with zeal, spend all one's energies, spare no effort," the same verb that is used of Esau's relationship with his wife Basemath [1.277], an indication that he matched in his rela- tionship to his wife the devotion which his father showed toward him). Josephus depicts Esau as reciprocating his father's devotion toward him. This trait would have struck a responsive chord particularly in the Romans, who valued the pietas which consti- tuted the cardinal trait of their founder Aeneas as represented in the great national poem, Virgil's Aeneid (e.g., 1.10), and as re- flected especially in the loving care of Aeneas for his father Anchises in the scene of the departure from Troy (Virgil, Aeneid, book 2, vv. 634ff.). Thus, while the biblical passage (Gen 27:5) states that Esau went (1I'1) to the field to get venison for Isaac, Josephus (1.269) presents him as acting with much greater enthu- siasm, since he says that Esau sped (g(opPlrqo£v, "rushed, started rapidly") to the chase.60 57 Speiser, Genesis (above, n. 51), p. 195. 58 Targum Neofiti adds two other negative statements to the description of Esau's deeds, namely that he despised not only his birthright but also the resur- rection of the dead and the world to come. 59 Philo (Quaestiones in Genesin 4.228) goes much further than Josephus in defending Jacob's deception of his brother. He cites the parallel of athletes, whose use of deceit and trickery in contests is considered honorable. 60 Indeed, we may add, one of the rabbis, the first-century patriarch Simeon ben Gamaliel, a direct contemporary of Josephus, is quoted (GenR 65.16; cf. DeutR 1.15) as paying the supreme compliment to Esau when he declares, "All my lifetime I attended upon my father, yet I did not do for him a hundredth part 126</page><page sequence="27">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN Further sympathy is aroused for Esau in Josephus' portrayal of the scene in which Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau. This scene is much more elaborate and poignant in the Hebrew than in Josephus' paraphrase, presumably because Josephus sought to diminish the friction between the descendants of Jacob and Esau. In particular, Josephus omits from the blessing of Esau the statement that he shall live by the sword and the prediction that he will someday break the yoke from off his neck (Gen 27:40); instead, we have the much milder assertion (1.275) that Esau shall be renowned for strength of body in arms and in labors of all kinds.61 Moreover, when Isaac realized that Jacob had wrested the blessing from Esau, the Bible (Gen 27:33) says that he trem- bled exceedingly, but Josephus, again seeking to reduce the ten- sion between the two brothers, states that "perceiving his error, Isaac held his peace." Another delicate topic connected with Esau in which Josephus walked a tightrope, so to speak, was Esau's intermarriages with Canaanite women. That Josephus was sensitive to the problem may be seen in the stress which he puts (4.131-155) on the Israelites' sin with the Midianite women (Num 25:1-9), which he has expanded from nine verses to twenty-five paragraphs.62 Like- wise, in dealing with Hamor's request for the hand of Dinah (Gen of the service which Esau did for his father." The second-century Judah bar Ilai (GenR 76.2) declares that Jacob feared that Esau had been more righteous than he because he had kept two commandments which he, Jacob, had neglected, namely living in the Holy Land and attending hi$ parents. The third-century R. Simlai (some report it in the name of his contemporary R. Abbahu) presents a scenario (GenR 67.5) in which God rebukes Isaac for speaking kind words to Esau after the latter had cried when he discovered that Jacob had received Isaac's blessing. Isaac's reply to God's charge that Esau was wicked is that Esau had acted righteously in honoring his parents. Indeed, the rabbis (GenR 65.16) remark that the good fortune which the Romans enjoy on earth is due to the great respect which their ancestor, Esau, showed toward his father. 61 One is reminded of Virgil's statement in the proem to his epic (Aeneid 1.10) in which he speaks of Aeneas undergoing so many labors (tot adire labores). 62 This sensitivity to the problem of intermarriage may likewise be perceived in Josephus' moral from the Samson story that one must not debase (napeX6pacoov, used of coins) one's rule of life (6iatrav) by imitating foreign ways (5.306). And yet Josephus was aware that too strenuous an objection against intermarriage would play into the hands of anti-Semites who charged the Jews with misan- thropy. Hence, in the case of Samson (5.286), he tones down the severe objections of Samson's parents to intermarriage; and in place of "Is there never a woman 127</page><page sequence="28">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 34:6), Josephus carefully balances (1.338) the fact that it is un- lawful to marry one's daughter to a foreigner against the rank of the petitioner; and so, in an extrabiblical addition, he sagely asks permission to hold a council on the matter in order to avoid giving the impression that Jacob was rude to Hamor.63 Similarly, in the case of Esau, the Bible (Gen 26:35), though not explicitly stating that Isaac rebuked him, uses very strong language in stating that Esau's wives were "a bitterness of spirit (mni nt3l) unto Isaac and Rebecca." Josephus (1.265-266), how- ever, carefully avoids condoning his marriages with Canaanite women, while using restrained language (1.277) in stating that Isaac and his family "were not well inclined" (E£v6ouv, "were not favorable") to the Canaanites. He thus declares that Esau con- tracted the marriages on his own responsibility without consulting his father, "for Isaac would never have permitted them had his advice been sought, having no desire to form ties of affinity with the indigenous population." But then he departs from the Hebrew text, as well as from the Septuagint version (which describes the wives as £piiouuact, i.e., "contending, quarreling, provoking"), and totally ignores the degree, noted in the Bible, to which Esau's wives made life miserable for Isaac and Rebecca. Then, seeking, through his expansion of the narrative to excuse Isaac's reaction, Josephus states that not wishing to create enmity with his son by ordering him to separate himself from these women, Isaac re- solved to hold his peace, as he did when he realized that Jacob had wrested the blessing from Esau. Even when Esau finally did reform and married his relative Basemath (Hebrew: Mahalat), it is clear in the Bible (Gen 28:9) that he did so because he realized that the Canaanite women were evil in the eyes of his father and because he followed the example of Jacob in seeking a mate from his kin. But in Josephus (1.277) we are told specifically that Esau among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?" (Judg 14:3), he has the mere declaration that "they were for refusing because she was not of their race." 63 Because Josephus realized how unfavorably the whole circumcision incident, including the massacre of the Shechemites while they were weak and the taking of spoil from them by Simeon and Levi (Gen 34:13-29), would be viewed by his non-Jewish readers, he (1.338-340) omits it completely. Instead, just as Dinah had been ravished during a festival, so are they slaughtered, measure for measure, during a festival. 128</page><page sequence="29">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN had already married her before the time when Jacob left to take a wife for himself from his kinsfolk in Mesopotamia. Furthermore, while the Hebrew text (Gen 26:34-35) identifies Basemath as the daughter of Elon the Hittite and declares that this marriage caused bitterness of spirit to Isaac and Rebecca, Josephus (1.277) follows the later text (Gen 36:3) in describing her as the daughter of Ishmael, Isaac's kinsman. He thus arouses sympathy for Esau, since he states that the reason why Esau married her was to gratify his parents. As noted above, we are told (ibid.) in an extrabiblical addition that would create sympathy for Esau that he was deeply devoted (anouvaaocg, "pursue with zeal, spend all one's energies upon, spare no effort") to her. In general, Josephus downplays Esau's anger. Thus, we are informed in the Hebrew text (Gen 27:43) that Rebecca told Jacob that Esau intended to kill him and persuaded him to flee to Laban in order to escape Esau's furious wrath; but in Josephus (1.276) there is no mention of the statement that Esau intended to kill Jacob. Indeed, it is Isaac whom she persuades to take a wife for Jacob from his kinsfolk in Mesopotamia, thus giving Jacob an opportunity to leave. Again, the Bible (Gen 27:41) records Esau's pledge to slay Jacob as soon as their father dies, but Josephus (1.276) omits this pledge, even though Jacob was admit- tedly in terror of his brother, who wished to avenge himself for having been deprived of the benediction. The scene (Gen 33:1-16) in which Jacob and Esau are recon- ciled becomes in Josephus a central event and is narrated in great detail. On the one hand, Jacob's preparations for the encounter are a full-blown military stratagem giving Josephus, the military general in Galilee, an opportunity to display his knowledge of military strategy (Esau has not just 400 men-presumably armed, though not so stated explicitly-as in Gen 32:7, but 400 explicitly armed men [1.327]). On the other hand, Jacob's instructions to his messengers (1.326) are much more conciliatory, since he pre- sents the extrabiblical details that Jacob had left the country of his own free will, thinking it wrong to live with Esau while his wrath persisted. He further remarks that he is now entrusting himself into Esau's hands, "holding it the greatest of blessings to share with his brother what God had given to him." In particular, Josephus adds to the biblical account (Gen 32:4-5) (1.326) that Jacob instructed his messengers to tell Esau that he now thought 129</page><page sequence="30">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that the long interval of time during which they were separated was sufficient to make a reconciliation with each other possible. The whole scene in the Hebrew is fraught with ambiguity. Was Esau sincere? In particular, the word 1;i7U', "and he [Esau] kissed him [Jacob]" (Gen 33:4), which in the Masoretic text is dotted, led to a fundamental dispute among the rabbis as to whether Esau was sincere. The second-century R. Shim'on bar Yohai (Sifre Num 69, ed. Horovitz, p. 65), who had suffered greatly at the hands of the Romans, remarked nevertheless that as a rule it is known that Esau hated Jacob but that on this occasion his true love for his brother was stirred. But R. Yannai (second and third centuries) avers (GenR 78.9) that Esau intended to bite him. Josephus (1.335), ever eager to diminish the tension between them, declares outright that Esau approached Jacob with no thought of treachery. As to the key word, "kissed," which led to such disagreement among the rabbis, Josephus (1.336), like the majority of the manuscripts of the Septuagint, eliminates it, stating instead that Esau greeted (onao7aclc £VOg)64 Jacob and questioned him concerning the crowd of children around him. One final touch: in Gen 33:8-11 Jacob had to insist that Esau accept the gifts which he offered him, and Esau finally did so. In Josephus (1.335-336) there is no mention of Esau refusing the gifts, presumably because the Greeks thought ill of someone who would do so; Achilles' refusal of gifts offered by Agamemnon, in contrast to the eventual willingness of Meleager to accept them, is a major theme in Homer's Iliad (Book 9). 6. The Equation of Esau and Rome How can we explain the relatively favorable treatment of Esau by Josephus? Is it because he equates Esau and Rome, and as a lackey of the Romans he seeks to rehabilitate Esau and to di- minish the enmity between him and Jacob? How far back does the equation of Esau and Rome go?65 64 The verb aodn6otiat can, to be sure, mean "kiss"; but a far more usual meaning is "welcome kindly" or "greet." We should note the fact that the phrase Kai KaTE(piXqcev ("and he kissed") is not found in any of the best manuscripts of the Septuagint. 65 Adolf Schlatter, The Church in the New Testament Period, tr. Paul P. Levertoff (London, 1955), pp. 255-256, suggests that the equation of Edom with 130</page><page sequence="31">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN That the Romans were thought of as descendants of Esau is possibly to be seen in 4 Ezra (6:8-9) dating, according to most scholars, about 100 BCE, which speaks of Esau as "the end of this age" and Jacob as "the beginning of the age that follows."66 Zunz67 first offered the suggestion that the equation of Edom with Rome arose from the Idumaean origin of Herod, who re- ceived his kingship in Rome, who was able to sustain it only with the help of the Roman authorities, and who thus brought about the destruction of the Holy Land and the exile of the Jewish people. However, there is no evidence to confirm this conjecture, despite the fact that we know more about Herod than about Rome is paralleled by the similar equation, at about the same time in Palestinian Judaism, between Babylon and Rome, as seen, for example, in 1 Peter 5:13. Most recently Jacob Neusner, From Enemy to Sibling: Rome and Israel in the First Century of Western Civilization: An Experiment in Method (New York, 1986), has stressed that in the Mishnah, redacted ca. 200, and in the Tosefta, redacted perhaps a century later, Rome is merely a place and does not stand for Israel's nemesis and counterpart, and there is no equation of Esau and Rome. He argues that it is only in the fifth century, after the conversion of Constantine to Chris- tianity, that we find in midrashic literature (GenR 53.12, LevR 13.5) the equation of Esau = Edom = Rome = Christianity. In reply to this we may note that the Mishnah and Tosefta are codes of law which contain almost no historical refer- ences. Hence, one would hardly expect a reference to history or to contemporary events, wheras the midrashim are sermonic in nature and hence often do have such references. In the second place, Neusner assumes that a document reflects the date of its redaction, whereas it seems more likely that the rabbis would be careful to preserve the words of their predecessors, especially of someone as revered as R. Akiba, who, as I note below, in the early second century (GenR 65.21), equated Esau and Rome. It should also be emphasized that the third-century R. Eleazar ben Pedat, in the name of his teacher R. Hanina bar Hama (bMeg 15a), placed a high premium upon reporting a saying in the name of its originator. 66 So Isaac Heinemann, "Josephus' Method in the Presentation of Jewish Antiquities" [Hebrew], Zion 5 (1939-40): 193. Another possible reference to the equation of Esau and Rome may be implied in Philo (De vita Mosis 1.43.242), who speaks of the feud between Jacob and Esau as "renewed by the nation so many generations after." True, Philo is referring in the context to the struggle between the Israelites and the Edomites during the sojourn of the Israelites in the desert after the exodus from Egypt. But a reader might well have seen here a reference to the contemporary situation. 67 Leopold Zunz, Zur Geschichte und Literatur (Berlin, 1845), p. 484. So also Ginzberg, Legends, 5:272, n. 19; and Groibart, "Edom and Rome" (above, n. 50), pp. 75-81. Herod's role in the equation is rightly disputed by Moses D. Herr, The Roman Rule in the Literature of the Tanaaim (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1970), pp. 115-129. 131</page><page sequence="32">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW almost any other figure from antiquity. Schlatter68 suggested that the equation arose as an anti-Herodian attack by the Zealots, who needed the support of prophecy to justify their taking up arms against Rome, and that it was later appropriated by the rabbis; but there is likewise no evidence to support this view, as Cohen69 has pointed out. Indeed, we may add that since Josephus favored Rome and as a descendant of the Hasmoneans hated Herod, it is unlikely that he would have fostered the equation of Herodian Edom with Rome. It was perhaps inevitable, as Cohen70 has remarked, that these two great peoples of antiquity, the Jews and the Romans, each of whom considered itself to be divinely chosen and destined for a unique history, should be associated with each other, although the question remains why Edom was chosen and not, for ex- ample, Babylon, which was, as we have noted, to be identified later (1 Peter 5:13; Rev 14:8, 16:19, 17:2, 17:5, 18:2, 18:10, 18:21) as the prototype of Rome. The first rabbi who is cited as clearly identifying Rome with Esau and Edom is R. Akiba (ca. 50-135 CE), a somewhat younger contemporary of Josephus, who ex- plains (GenR 65.21)71 the verse (Gen 27:22) "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau" as illustrat- ing the anguished cry of Jacob, that is, of the Jewish people, caused by what the hands of Esau, that is presumably the Romans, had done to them. We may guess that in view of his extended and bitter experience with the Romans, there is a refer- ence, though admittedly it is not explicit, to the contemporary struggle between the Jews and the Roman Empire in R. Shim'on bar Yohai's statement (Sifre Num 69; p. 65, ed. Horovitz): "It is a well-established tradition (rnT;o): Esau hates Jacob." This would seem to indicate that the equation of Esau with Rome was already axiomatic; hence it seems reasonable to suppose that it was known half a century earlier when Josephus was writing. When the Roman Emperor Antoninus, with whomever he may be identified, asks Rabbi (Judah the Prince) (bAZ 10b), who lived 68 Schlatter, The Church (above, n. 65), pp. 255-256. 69 Cohen, "Esau as Symbol" (above, n. 48), p. 21, n. 7. 70 Ibid., pp. 25-26. 71 This is the interpretation of Julius Theodor and Chanoch Albeck, Bereschit Rabbah, 2nd ed.

Hence when Josephus (1.275), in an extrabiblical comment, has Isaac predict that Esau's descendants, through strength of body in arms and through labors of all kinds,74 will reap an age-long (6t' aicovo;) reputation, it would seem likely that he has Rome, Virgil's urbs aeterna, in mind.75 72 We may note here that Josippon (1.2), written in 953 but apparently depen- dent upon good sources of information, some of which are no longer extant, has a story about Esau's grandson Zepho, who accompanies Aeneas on his expeditions in Italy, becomes king of the Kittim, has a grandson Latinus (the name of Aeneas' father-in-law), and eventually has a descendant Romulus, who founds the city of Rome. 73 Josephus, by his own report at any rate, was so well versed in rabbinic tradition that at the age of fourteen (Life 9) the chief priests and the leading men of Jerusalem used to consult him constantly for precise information with regard to tradition. For his knowledge of the Oral Law, as codified by his contemporaries, the tannaitic rabbis, see David Goldenberg, Halakhah in Josephus and in Tan- naitic Literature: A Comparative Study (Ph.D. diss., Dropsie College, Phila- delphia, 1978), and Feldman "Use, Authority," pp. 507-518. Goldenberg (p. 19) calls attention to a recently discovered manuscript of the Talmud in which there is a unique reading in a passage (bAZ 8b; MS Marx-Abramson) which states specifi- cally that halakhah was written down at the time of Judah ben Baba. See Shraga Abramson, ed., 'Abodah Zarah (New York, 1957), pp. xiv-xv. The passage was first noted by Solomon Zeitlin, "Megillat Taanit as a Source for Jewish Chron- ology and History in the Hellenistic and Roman Periods," JQR 9 (1918-19): 72, n. 2. For Josephus' knowledge of aggadah see Salomo Rappaport, Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus (Wien, 1930) and my various articles (above, n. 9). 74 Cf. Aeneas' parting words to his son Astyanax (Aeneid 12.435): "Learn valor (virtutem) from me, my son, and true toil (verumque laborem)." We must note, however, that Josephus (1.275) does retain Isaac's prediction (Gen 27:40) that Esau will serve his brother. Nevertheless, this prediction appears in precisely the same section where Josephus compliments Esau by declaring, as we have noted, that he will be renowned for strength of body in arms and in labors of all kinds. 75 On Josephus' knowledge of Latin see Henry St. John Thackeray, Josephus the Man and the Historian (New York, 1929), pp. 39-41, 67-69, 71-72, 109; Beniamin Nadel, "Josephus Flavius and the Terminology of Roman Political 133</page><page sequence="34">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 7. Answers to Anti-Jewish Charges Not only in the treatise Against Apion but also in his Antiqui- ties Josephus constantly seeks to answer anti-Jewish attacks.76 Here it is important to note that it is not so much Jacob's reputation as the reputation of the Jewish people that he is defending. Thus in the Bible (Gen 46:33-34) Joseph instructed his brothers that when asked by Pharaoh about their occupation, they should reply not that they were shepherds (as indeed they were)-since shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians- but rather that they were owners of cattle. Shepherds, moreover, were apparently despised not only by the Egyptians but also by the Jews, as we can see from the comment ascribed to the third- century R. Jose ben Hanina (Midrash Proverbs 23.2, p. 99b [198]), that "there is no craft in the world more despised than that of the shepherd." The fact that shepherds, since they are said to graze on other people's land, are disqualified to act as witnesses (bSanh 25b) is another indication of the low esteem in which they were held. Josephus has Joseph himself tell Pharaoh directly and apologetically (2.185-186) that his brothers are good shepherds and that they follow this calling so that they may not be separated and may look after their father. He presents the novel economic factor that they follow this calling in order to ingratiate themselves to the Egyptians by not competing with them, since Egyptians were forbidden to occupy themselves with pasture of livestock. He thus answers the charge of the opponents of the Jews who apparently claimed that Jews constituted an economic threat to the Egyptians' livelihood.77 Indeed, I have argued elsewhere that Invective" (Polish), Eos 56 (1966): 256-272; Menahem Stern, "The Greek and Latin Literary Sources," in Shmuel Safrai and Menahem Stern, eds., The Jewish People in the First Century: Historical Geography, Political History, Social, Cultural, and Religious Life and Institutions (Assen, 1974), p. 29; David Daube, "Three Legal Notes on Josephus after His Surrender," Law Quarterly Review (London) 93 (1977): 191-194; and my comments on these in my Josephus and Modern Scholarship (Berlin, 1984), pp. 821, 836. 76 See my "Use, Authority," pp. 481-503. 77 Speiser, Genesis (above, n. 51), p. 345, says that the taboo cannot apply to shepherds as such, since there is no evidence that shepherds were held in contempt in Egypt. (According to Philo, De agricultura 9.41, Jacob is termed a shepherd because shepherds prefer what is distasteful but beneficial to what is pleasant but hurtful.) In all likelihood the term "shepherd," he suggests, plays on the popular 134</page><page sequence="35">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN economics was a major factor in the hatred exhibited by non- Jews toward the Jews in Alexandria in the pogrom of 38 CE.78 8. Jacob and Nationalism As one who had participated in the war against the Romans and who had come to the conclusion that resistance to Rome was futile and that Rome was divinely destined to rule the world, Josephus constantly seeks to prevail upon his compatriots to give up the dream of national independence. While in the Bible the promise of Canaan's land to Abraham is constantly renewed,79 Josephus shifts the stress from the covenanted Land of Israel, so dear to the revolutionaries, to the biblical personalities themselves and to the role of the Diaspora. In fact, Josephus never uses the word "covenant" (&amp;6tLr0Kc), which is the Septuagint's equivalent for the Hebrew n3:.80 Instead of promises that the Jews will have the land of Canaan we have predictions. Thus Josephus omits the passage (Gen 36:3-5) which relates God's blessing to Isaac promising the land to Abraham's descendants. It is sig- nificant that while in the Bible (Gen 27:27-29) Isaac's blessing of Jacob (whom he thinks to be Esau) asks God for agricultural abundance and power to demand respect from other nations (the Hebrew reads "Nations shall serve thee and peoples bow down to thee"; and the Septuagint reads, "Let nations serve thee, and princes bow down to thee"), in Josephus (1.272) the national aspect is totally omitted, and instead we have a prayer for per- sonal happiness and satisfaction. interpretation of the Hyksos as shepherd-kings, whose temporary domination of Egypt was such a tremendous blow to national pride. 78 See my "Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World" (above, n. 22), p. 23. 79 See Betsy H. Amaru, "Land Theology in Josephus' Jewish Antiquities," JQR 71(1980-81): 201-229. 80 Andre Paul, "Flavius Josephus' 'Antiquities of the Jews': An Anti-Christian Manifesto," New Testament Studies 31 (1985): 473-480, suggests that Josephus' substitution of the word rnakav ("truce") for the word nl': (Gen 9:9; Septuagint ta90Klcrlv) arises from his desire to dissociate himself from the New Testament's emphasis on the doctrine of the "new covenant." But note my reply in "Portrait of Noah," pp. 26-27, in which I state, among other things, that if Josephus were writing an anti-Christian polemic he would have been expected in his time to be more open about it, inasmuch as the Christians were then few in number and hardly held in favor by Domitian, under whom Josephus wrote his Antiquities. 135</page><page sequence="36">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Again, when Isaac blesses Jacob before sending him off to find a wife, the Bible (Gen 28:3) invokes God's blessing to "make thee fruitful and multiply thee, that thou mayest become a multitude of people," and (Gen 28:4) to let Jacob inherit the land which God gave to Abraham; but Josephus (1.278), aware that the Romans were sensitive to the great expansion of the Jewish population, especially through proselytism,81 omits this. Further- more, while the Bible (Gen 28:14) declares, in God's promise in Jacob's dream, that his seed will be "as the dust of the earth," and that "thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south," Josephus (1.282) predicts that the number of Jacob's direct descendants (uioil) will be vast (as, indeed, was the case at the time when Josephus was writing), but he is careful to avoid any indication that they will seek to convert others to Judaism. There is no reference in Josephus (1.309) to a forthcoming independent state when Jacob expresses the desire to depart to his own home (nOp6o auTo6v); in the Bible (Gen 30:25) Jacob asks Laban to send him away, "that I may go unto my own place, and to my country (IK'Xi)." When Jacob replies to Laban's objection to his attempt to escape from him, he speaks, in a long extrabiblical addition (1.317), not in terms of nationalism but rather in terms of love of one's native land (ntazpi6og), which, he says, is innate (£(p0oyalt) in every person. A key to Josephus' political position may be seen in the scene (1.331-34) where Jacob wrestles with the angel. In the Hebrew (Gen 32:28) the angel tells him that his name will from now on be Israel because "you have striven with God and with men and have prevailed." In Josephus' version (1.333) the struggle with men (which might, presumably, include the Romans) is signifi- cantly omitted from the explanation of the name, which, we are told, "denotes the opponent of an angel of God." The assurance which the angel gives him (1.332) is not in terms of a future nation but rather in the promise that his race (yevoO) will never be extinguished and that no mortal will surpass him personally in strength. Hence, as Butterweck82 aptly comments, Josephus has 81 See Louis H. Feldman, "Proselytism and Syncretism" [Hebrew], in Menahem Stern and Zvi Baras, eds., World History of the Jewish People, First Series: The Diaspora in the Hellenistic-Roman World (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 188-207, 340- 345, 378-380. 82 Annelise Butterweck, Jakobs Ringkampf am Jabbok: Gen. 32,4 ff in der jiidischen Tradition bis zum Friihmittelalter (Frankfurt am Main, 1981), pp. 51-56. 136</page><page sequence="37">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN given us a "gereinigten" text, wherein the name "Israel" assumes an eschatological rather than a political significance. It is, furthermore, important to note that while in the Hebrew (Gen 35:11) God at Bethel tells Jacob that "a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you"-a passage whose political significance, especially in view of the revolt of the Jews against the Romans, might well be offensive to the Romans-Josephus has quietly omitted the whole scene. Even more striking is Josephus' omission (2.194) of Jacob's blessing of Judah (Gen 49:8-10) predicting the militarism and sovereignty of Judah. In addition, inasmuch as the increase in numbers of Jews, particularly through proselytism, had caused, as we have noted, great anguish to some Romans, Josephus (2.194) omits Jacob's statement to Joseph (Gen 48:4) that God will make him fruitful and multiply him, will make of him a multitude of people, and will give his descendants the land of Canaan as an "eternal possession." In the account of Jacob's death (2.194) Jacob prophesies how each of their descendants is destined to find a habitation (KazotolKv) in Canaan, but there is no mention of an independent state. Likewise, Josephus omits (2.195) Jacob's blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh (Gen 48:16) to the effect that they would grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. Josephus (2.201) also changes the biblical statement (Gen 47:17) that Israel in Egypt "were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly" into a statement that the Egyptians became bitterly disposed towards the Hebrews by envy of their prosperity (c66atloviag), omitting all mention of their increase in numbers. 9. Detheologizing and Avoidance of Theological Difficulties in Josephus' Narrative of Jacob According to Josephus (Ant. 1.14), the main lesson to be derived from a study of his history is that God rewards those who obey his laws and punishes those who do not. And yet, as I have noted elsewhere,83 Josephus prefers to approach the Bible as history, leaving theological matters for a projected work (Ant. 1.25, 1.192, 3.143, 4.198, 20.268) which he apparently never com- pleted.84 83 Feldman, "Use, Authority," pp. 503-507. 84 The most striking example of Josephus' diminution of the role of God may be seen in the Ruth pericope. In that entire episode (Ant. 5.318-336) Josephus 137</page><page sequence="38">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW In the Jacob pericope there are numerous examples of what we may call "detheologizing." Thus, when God appears to Jacob in a dream (Gen 28:13), in the Hebrew text he identifies himself thus: "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac." In Josephus' version (1.280) God does not identify himself at all but rather emphasizes Jacob's genealogy: "Jacob, offspring of a good sire and of a grandsire who won renown for exceeding virtue." Furthermore, when Jacob is awakened from his sleep, he says in the biblical text (Gen 28:16): "Surely the Lord is present in this place, and I knew it not"; but Josephus totally omits this reference to God. Again, the Bible (Gen 29:31) says that "the Lord saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb," whereas Josephus (1.303-304) puts the emphasis on Leah's feel- ings rather than on God's: "Now Leah was grievously mortified by her husband's passion for her sister; and hoping to win his esteem by bearing children she made continual supplication to God." Again, before the confrontation with Esau, Jacob (Gen 32:10-13) prays at length to God and declares (32:10) his un- worthiness of all the kindness and truth which he has shown to him. Josephus (1.329) omits the prayer and simply declares (1.327) that Jacob committed to God his hope of salvation. Moreover, Josephus' sophisticated readers might well have objected to the biblical statement (Gen 32:29) in the explanation of Jacob's new name Israel, that Jacob had striven with God; and so he says (1.332) that he had defeated an angel of God. The role of God is further diminished in Josephus' omission (1.342) of the terror of God that was upon the cities through which Jacob journeyed (Gen 35:5), as well as of the second theophany at Bethel (Gen 35:9-13). Where Josephus does, in an editorial comment, introduce the role of God, it is in a Stoic-like guise, as Providence. Thus we see, for example, in his preface to the Joseph narrative (2.8), that God (presented as a neuter abstraction, TO Ociov) showed such providential care (nip6votav) for Jacob that he made even events that seemed to him deplorable become the source of utmost felicity. Most instructive of Josephus' attitude is the scene at Beer-sheba when Jacob is about to depart for Egypt. In the nowhere mentions God, except at the very end, despite the fact that in the biblical account he is mentioned seventeen times. 138</page><page sequence="39">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN Hebrew (Gen 46:1-4) Jacob offers sacrifices and God speaks to him. Furthermore, in the account of Jacob's blessing of his sons, Josephus (2.194) does not mention the name of God even once, whereas in Gen 49 God is mentioned four times (49.19, 24, 25 bis). We may note in particular that in the blessing of Joseph, the Hebrew (Gen 48:15) mentions God twice; in Josephus (2.195) we are told that Jacob lavished praises upon Joseph, but there is no mention of God. Where Josephus does introduce God while the Hebrew text does not, it is because he seeks to free Jacob from the serious charge of condoning idolatry: thus, while the Bible (Gen 35:2) puts into Jacob's mouth the instruction to get rid of strange gods, which would make it seem that he already knew of their presence, in Josephus (1.341) it is God who bids him undertake the purifi- cation of his tents. Finally, when he does refer to God, as we have seen, he sometimes refers to him in neutral terms that would appeal to his Hellenized audience. Thus he speaks of him as TO Oelov (2.8), or as Providence (cnpovota, ibid.), or (in Isaac's blessing of Jacob, 1.272) as Lord of all eternity (navtzgc aiovog, a term familiar to us from Plato's Timaeus 37D) and creator (6rltuoupy6g, a term familiar to us likewise from Plato's Timaeus), and as universal being (Tzq 6S`Xr oucriaq, a Stoic phrase).85 When it comes to miracles, Josephus, though admittedly not consistently sensitive to his readers' skepticism, frequently (e.g., 1.108, 3.81, 4.158, 10.281) employs the time-honored formula found in Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Roman Antiquities 1.48.1, 1.48.4, 2.40.3, 2.74.5, 3.36.5), Lucian (How to Write History 10), and Pliny (Natural History 9.18), among others, allowing the reader to make up his own mind, which, as Delling and MacRae86 have indicated, is an expression of courtesy to his pagan readers. 85 See Harry A. Wolfson, Philo (Cambridge, MA, 1947), 1:277, 300, 320-321; 2:106. For similar Stoic coloring in Josephus' conception of the omnipresence of God see Antiquities 8.108 and 8.227. Another instance of Josephus' use of Stoic terminology may be seen in his proof of the existence of God: see my "Abraham the Greek Philosopher" pp. 146-149. Another example may be found in Josephus' version of the 'Aqedah: see my "Josephus: the 'Aqedah," especially pp. 222-224. Moreover, Luther H. Martin, "Josephus' Use of Heimarmene in the Jewish Antiquities XIII, 171-173," Numen 28 (1981): 127-137, has shown that in his view of fate Josephus was indebted to popular nontechnical Stoicism. 86 Gerhard Delling, "Josephus und das Wunderbare," Novum Testamentum 2 (1957-58): 291-309; George W. MacRae, "Miracle in The Antiquities of Josephus," 139</page><page sequence="40">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Thus, while the Bible (Gen 28:12) speaks of angels ascending and descending in Jacob's dream, Josephus (1.279), rationalizing, declares that Jacob thought that he saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven; and instead of angels Josephus has phantoms (o6WEi, "appearances, visions, apparitions") of nature. These phantoms are compared to mortals, but are said to be more august (oatv6ocEpov). Likewise, when Jacob, on his return to Canaan after his reconciliation with Laban, meets angels (Gen 32:2), Josephus (1.325) says that he had visions ((pavTa'opaTa, "specters, apparitions, phantoms")87 which inspired him with good hopes. Furthermore, while the Bible (Gen 32:31) explains the etymology of the name of the place Penuel, where Jacob had wrestled with the angel, as due to the fact that he had seen God face to face, Josephus gives its meaning as "the face of God" without explaining the reason for the name, presumably because he wished to avoid the reference to the angel and because he sought to avoid the anthropomorphism of seeing God face to face. Josephus (2.195) has also eliminated the reference to angels in Jacob's blessing (Gen 48:16) of Ephraim and Manasseh. On the other hand, confronted with the apparent mutual contradic- tion of the statements that a man wrestled with Jacob (Gen 32:25), that Jacob wrestled with God and with men (Gen 32:29), and that he had seen God face to face (Gen 32:31), Josephus (1.332) declares that Jacob defeated an angel (the word aiyy cos, meaning both "angel" and "messenger," preserves the ambiguity) of God. Josephus (1.309), apparently because like Cicero in his De divinatione he was skeptical of such techniques, has eliminated the reference (Gen 30:27) to the divination by which Laban had supposedly learned that he had been blessed because of Jacob. Similarly, the Bible (Gen 37:35) seemingly introduces a pagan concept of Sheol (which the Septuagint has translated "Hades"), where Jacob says he must go mourning into the grave, but in Charles F. D. Moule, Miracles: Cambridge Studies in Their Philosophy and History (London, 1965), pp. 136-142. 87 Similarly, the Hebrew text declares (Judg 6:11) that an angel appeared to Gideon, while Josephus (5.213) says that a specter ((pdvTacota) appeared to him in the form of a young man. Likewise, it is a specter ((pavTacyta) rather than an angel (Judg 13:3) that appears to Manoah's wife (5.277) in the form of a comely and tall youth. 140</page><page sequence="41">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN Josephus (2.38) omits the reference and says simply that Jacob sat in sackcloth, heavy with grief. Finally, presumably because they raise serious questions about the authorship and date of the revelation of the Torah, Josephus systematically omits the six passages (such as the last twelve verses of Deuteronomy) which, according to the medieval com- mentator Ibn Ezra (on Deut 1:1), present such difficulties. As for the Jacob pericope, an additional such passage, omitted by Josephus (1.343), is the biblical statement (Gen 35:20) that "this is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day," which implies that the passage was written long after the event. Another such passage, again omitted by Josephus (2.6), is the biblical statement (Gen 36:31), again presumably written from a much later vantage point when the Israelites had kings, that "these are the kings that reigned in Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel." 10. Dramatic and Romantic Motifs The ancient historian88 was constantly concerned that his ac- count should be attractive to his readers. One basic reason why Josephus undertook in effect, in the first half of his Antiquities, to rewrite the Septuagint, even though he does not spell this out in the proem to the work, was that he wished to make both the stories in, and the style of, the Bible more attractive to his readers, especially to non-Jews. One way that Josephus sought to win his intellectual audience was by presenting them with themes familiar to them from the tragedians.89 Josephus also sought to make his narrative more appealing to his Greek readers by intro- ducing romantic motifs reminiscent of Homer, Herodotus, Xeno- phon's Cyropaedia, and Hellenistic novels.90 88 See my Cicero's Conception of Historiography (Ph.D. diss., Harvard Uni- versity, Cambridge, MA, 1951), pp. 16-52; "Portrait of Saul," pp. 46-52; and "Use, Authority," pp. 500-503. 89 On Josephus' introduction of motifs and even language from Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides see in general my "Use, Authority," pp. 500-501. On the influence of Sophocles in particular see my "Josephus as an Apologist"; and on the influence of Euripides upon Josephus see my "Josephus: the 'Aqedah," pp. 219-246. 90 See in general my "Use, Authority," pp. 501-503; and, in particular, my "Hellenizations of Esther." 141</page><page sequence="42">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW We may note that pathos is the hallmark of the Greek ro- mances. In Josephus' version of the Esther narrative, for example, the extent of Mordecai's devotion to Esther is increased by having the statement that Mordecai took Esther for his own daughter transferred from the beginning of the narrative (Esther 2:7) to the point (2:11) where Esther is separated from him and is in the king's palace as his queen; at that point (Antiquities 11.204) there is an increase in pathos, for Mordecai lingers about the palace inquiring about Esther, "for he loved her as his own daughter." Josephus introduced an element of suspense in his account (1.286) of the meeting of Jacob and Rachel. In Josephus' version (1.286) the shepherds wonder why Rachel has not yet arrived, and thus there is, as Villalba91 remarks, an air of mystery which is not found in the biblical account (Gen 29:1-14). There is similar suspense in Jacob's anxiety (2.19) when his sons betake them- selves to Sikima (Shechem) without previously telling him of their departure, and he conceives the gloomiest forebodings con- cerning them. This, in turn, supplies a much better motivation for Joseph's visit to see what had befallen his brothers than does the Bible (Gen 37:13), which simply says that Jacob told Joseph, "Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." There is further suspense in Josephus' version (2.36-37) of Joseph's disappearance. As Josephus would have it, after Joseph's brothers had dipped Joseph's tunic in goat's blood, they came to their father, who had already received news of his son's misadventure. Josephus then paints a scene of Jacob cherishing the hope that his son had been kidnapped; but the suspense is ended when he sees the tunic dipped in blood. In the Greek novels-though admittedly this is a motif found elsewhere as well-we frequently hear of heroes and heroines threatening to take their own lives because of disgrace.92 Simi- larly, in the Bible (Gen 44:31) Judah tells his brother Joseph that if Jacob were to see that Benjamin is not with his brothers upon their return from Egypt, "thy servants would thus bring down the gray hairs of thy servant, our father, with sorrow to the grave," 91 Pere Villalba i Varneda, The Historical Method of Flavius Josephus (Leiden, 1986), p. 233. 92 Cf., e.g., Antheia's threat in Xenophon of Ephesus' novel Ephesiaca, to commit suicide when she is bought by a brothel-master. 142</page><page sequence="43">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN implying that he would die of grief; in Josephus (2.150), however, Judah says that Jacob will hasten to render himself insensible, that is, he will commit suicide. To Josephus' pagan audience such suicide would have been appropriate; but as Josephus clearly states in his famous speech at Jotapata (War 3.361), such suicide would have been a betrayal of God's commands.93 There is likewise increased pathos in Josephus' account (2.118- 119), which is an expansion of the Bible (Gen 43:14), of the fulsome weeping both by Jacob and his sons over the departure of his sons, including his beloved Benjamin, to Egypt.94 On the one hand, Jacob is depicted as wondering whether his sons would ever return to him safely; and on the other hand, the sons are described as wondering whether they would, upon their return, find their father in good health and not stricken by his sorrow in their behalf. Josephus adds that they all spent an entire day in mourning before the sons finally left, leaving their father behind broken-hearted. All this is in contrast to not a single direct word in the biblical text (Gen 43:14) actually describing the emotional reaction of Jacob and his sons upon the latter's departure. As for romantic motifs, we may note that a number of such elements are introduced by Josephus throughout his paraphrase of the Bible.95 Thus, in Josephus' handling of the story of Jacob, 93 See the bibliography and my discussion of it with regard to the suicide of the defenders of Masada in my Josephus and Modern Scholarship (Berlin, 1984), pp. 779-789 and 966. 94 A similar tearful scene may be found in Josephus' description of David (7.203) weeping bitterly on the summit of the Mount of Olives when he hears that Ahitophel has joined his son Absalom in rebellion against him. 95 We may cite Pharaoh's excuse to Abraham regarding Sarah (1.165); details added to Abimelech's attempted seduction of Sarah (1.208); interest in how women manage to get seduced at a festival (1.337); Hamor's request that Dinah be given to him (1.338); a number of elements in the retelling of the story of the episode of Joseph and Potiphar's wife (2.41-59); the mad love of Tharbis, the Ethiopian princess, for Moses (2.252-253); erotic elements in the advice given by Balaam (4.129-130); the erotic appeal of the Midianite women to the Israelite youths (4.134); the concubine's failure to return the love of her husband (5.136); the suicide of the Levite concubine after she was raped (5.147); the apology for the rape of the women at Shiloh (5.171); the description of the actual seizure of the women of Shiloh by the Benjaminites (5.172-173); Solomon's thoughtless pleasure (8.193); and Solomon's excesses of passion (8.197). See, further, my "Josephus' Version of Samson," "Portrait of David," and "Hellenizations of Esther," pp. 150-153. 143</page><page sequence="44">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW a romantic element is added by having Jacob's meeting with the shepherds occur in the suburbs, with young men and maidens seated beside a well, whereas in the Bible (Gen 29:2) there is mention only of three flocks of sheep lying beside a well, with no indication that the setting was pastoral or that there were young men and maidens there. The meeting of Jacob and Rachel is even more romantic. In the biblical account (Gen 29:12) Rachel does not speak a word. In Josephus (1.286) it is Rachel who speaks, who weeps, and who embraces Jacob. The biblical text is very brief, but in contrast Josephus bases the whole scene on a dialogue consisting of re- ported speech (1.287), followed by direct speech (1.288-290), followed again by report speech (1.291-292). In Josephus' version Rachel acts with childish (vri7tiTtriTog) delight highly reminiscent of the reaction of Nausicaa (Homer, Odyssey, Book 6), when the stranger tells her whence he has come and when she offers to supply him with his wants. Just as Odysseus, after first considering whether he should throw his arms around Nausicaa's knees, decides that she might take offense at such immodest behavior, so Jacob, in Josephus' version (1.287), omits the biblical statement (Gen 29:11) that Jacob kissed Rachel almost immediately upon meeting her. And just as in Xenophon of Ephesus' novel (1.3.12) the hero Habrocomes and the heroine Anthia fall in love at first sight, as do a wealthy merchant named Psammis from India (3.11) and Anchialus (4.5) who is in charge of guarding Anthia,96 so also Jacob (1.288) in an extrabiblical comment was not so much overcome by the fact that he and Rachel were kin (Gen 29:12) as he was with love (Cpo)tt) for Rachel. That this was erotic love is clear from the use of the word Ep0ort. A similar change may be seen in Josephus' version of the Esther story, where in place of the Bible's statement that "the king loved Esther above all the women" (Esther 2:17) we read (11.202) that the king fell in love with the maiden (RCtc)cv TXfl K6prg eit Epooca). The romantic flavor of the scene is further enhanced by a number of Josephus' additions (1.291-292) to the biblical text (Gen 29:11-12), namely, that Rachel, "as young people are wont to do," recalls what she 96 The theme of love at first sight is common in the Greek romances: see Parthenius 1.1, Chariton 1.1.6-7, Achilles Tatius 1.4.2-5, and Heliodorus 3.5.4-5. 144</page><page sequence="45">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN had heard her father tell of the story of Rebecca. We are told that Rachel knew that her parents were longing to have word of her. She then, out of filial affection, bursts into tears, flings her arms around Jacob, and after tenderly embracing him says that he has brought the most cherished and keenest of pleasures to her father and to all her household, "for her father was devoted to the memory of Jacob's mother and dwelt only upon it, and his coming would appear to him worth more than every blessing in the world." Finally, she bids him, like Homer's Nausicaa, to "come straight to her father, following her lead, and to deprive him no longer of this pleasure by delay." All this is in contrast to the Bible, where Rachel is absolutely silent and where it is Laban who embraces Jacob and kisses him. The romantic flavor is also enhanced by Josephus' statement that Rachel's beauty was "such as few women of those days could show" (1.288), in contrast to the Bible's statement (Gen 29:17) that she was merely "of beautiful form and fair to look upon." On the other hand, Leah, who in the Bible (Gen 29:17) is de- scribed as having weak eyes, emerges in Josephus (1.301) as devoid of beauty (Triv 60tv OK cuEUpEin).97 A similar transfor- mation, we may note, is found in the case of Vashti, who in the Bible (Esther 1:11) is described merely as "fair to look upon" (as in the case of Rachel), in contrast to Josephus' version (11.190) that she "surpassed all women in beauty."98 The romantic element is further increased by the protraction of the negotiations (1.298) between Jacob and Laban, thus empha- sizing Jacob's love for Rachel. The Bible (Gen 29:18) simply declares that Jacob loved Rachel and that he said that he would serve Laban for seven years in order to win her as his wife. In Josephus' version Jacob says that he will gladly (6f8cos) tarry with Laban and that he will endure any labor in order to please him. Such a statement is reminiscent of the willingness of Greece's great national hero Heracles to wrestle with the river god Achelous, who had come as a suitor and who had the power of changing 97 It is true that 6oWt can refer to the organs of sight, but this is only when it is used in the plural. The fact that Josephus uses the singular here indicates that the word means "appearance." 98 See my "Hellenizations of Esther," pp. 148-149. Indeed, Josephus exaggerates the beauty of a number of other women in his Antiquities-Samson's mother (5.276), Bathsheba (7.130), and David's daughter Tamar (7.162). 145</page><page sequence="46">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW himself into various shapes, in order to win the hand of Deianira. Jacob's love for Rachel is, moreover, a physical love (Fpo)c);99 and it is this, according to Josephus, which motivates him to speak thus. The Bible (Gen 29:18 and 20) simply indicates that Jacob served Laban for seven years for Rachel, but Josephus (1.300) gives a reason for these years of service, namely that they gave proof of his worth (&amp;pcTijS, "excellence, virtue") in order that it might be better seen what manner of man he was. Such a motive is reminiscent of the story of Heracles, who performed twelve labors for Eurystheus in order to prove himself deserving of immortality. Josephus' (1.302) version is more romantic than the biblical statement (Gen 29:27), because in Josephus Jacob works seven years for Rachel before receiving her, whereas in the Bible he does so after receiving her. Moreover, while the Bible (Gen 29:28) declares that "Jacob did so," that is, that he served another seven years for Rachel, Josephus (1.302) is more romantic and declares that Jacob served Laban for an additional seven years because his love for Rachel permitted no other course. The romance is further heightened by Josephus' emphasis on Laban's deceit (1.301) in substituting Leah for Rachel. In Josephus' version Jacob is completely unaware beforehand (oU6bv 7npoic- 0r,ivo)°°100 of the deceit. Again, the scene is reminiscent of a famous scene from Greek (originally Phoenician) mythology, the relation between Theias (Cinyras), who is drunk, and his daughter Myrrha, which resulted in the birth of Adonis (Ovid, Metamorpho- ses 10.298-518; Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.14.4). Jacob's love for Rachel is also emphasized by the fact that after Leah has won from Rachel the right to spend the night with Jacob, Jacob agrees to do so (1.308) in order to please Rachel; in contrast, the biblical account (Gen 30:16) gives no reason why Jacob agreed. Indeed, Josephus (1.318) has substituted love for fear (Gen 31:31) as the motivating force behind the decision of Jacob's 99 Hebrew 'ahavah does not differentiate and serves for various kinds of love. 100 J. A. Diamond, "The Deception of Jacob: A New Perspective on an Ancient Solution to the Problem," VT 34 (1984): 211-213, suggests that the reason why Jacob could spend the entire night with Leah before realizing that he had been duped was that he was drunk from the wedding banquet, as indicated, he says, by Josephus (1.301). Diamond notes that the same terms are used for the older and younger daughters here that are employed in the case of Lot's daughters in a similar scene. 146</page><page sequence="47">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN wives to accompany him on his flight from Laban. Thus, in the biblical passage Jacob tells Laban that he fled with his wives (Laban's daughters) because he was afraid that Laban would take his daughters from him by force. In the Bible (Gen 31:14-16) Jacob's wives urge him to leave on purely economic grounds, namely that they have no reason to stay, since they will not gain any part of their father's inheritance. It is much more romantic in Josephus' version, where the wives' decision to accompany Jacob is based on their affection for him and particularly for their children. Josephus appeals to the common condition of things when he remarks, as a truism, that such affection is that which wedded wives are wont to have for their husbands. Such general observations and aphorisms make for a readable and instructive work and are in the tradition that we find in ancient historians generally. 10 Laban's imposition of grievous tasks upon Jacob (1.319), a motif which is developed by Josephus beyond the brief details in the Bible, is reminiscent of the tasks imposed upon several famous mythological heroes, notably Heracles, Jason, and Bellerophon. Josephus adds further to this romantic motif by having Jacob swear to Laban (3.323; there is no counterpart in Gen 31:51-53) that he would love his daughters as part of his pact with him. 101 Other examples of such sayings in Josephus are the following: those who obey well will know how to rule well (4.186); nothing is more deceitful than a woman who betrays our speech (5.294); men are affected most by those shocks that fall unexpectedly (5.358); men lose control of reason when blest by fortune (6.116); justice prevails over anger and fear (6.212); fear overcomes truth (6.259); when men attain power, off comes the mask (6.262); men of power listen to unsifted accusations (6.267); men emulate those who have bestowed some kindness upon them or flatter them in advance (6.341); the greatness of kings' power forbids them to be less than wholly good (6.349); we have more faith in what we do ourselves than in what is done through others (7.29); treacherous men often assume the role of good men to avert suspicion (7.34); prosperity makes one an object of envy (7.84); kings are more influenced by passion than by justice (7.147); water is worth more than money (7.312); it is not terrible to serve even a foreign master, let alone one's brother (7.373); evildoers gain nothing by postponement of their punishments (8.20); to preserve is greater than to acquire (8.121); prosperity begets sin (8.251); to show approval of the acts of kings, subjects must imitate them, even when they are evil (8.252); fate is not deceived by a change of garments (8.413); one should not believe flattery more than truth (8.418); the power of fate enters secretly into the souls of men and flatters them with fair hopes (8.419); successes and brilliant good fortune lead to the ruin of kings (9.223); destiny seeks a pretext for destruction (10.76); what is wise and divine cannot be bought with gifts (10.241). 147</page><page sequence="48">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Josephus himself develops this motif in his account of David's speed in fulfilling Saul's demand of six hundred heads of Philistines in lieu of a dowry (6.203). 11. Summary In his portrait of Jacob Josephus was confronted with his greatest challenge in paraphrasing the Bible. On the one hand, Jacob, whose very name was changed to Israel, was, through his twelve sons, the direct ancestor of the twelves tribes of Israel; hence in a work which was manifestly apologetic and largely directed to Gentiles Josephus sought to answer anti-Jewish charges by seeking to aggrandize Jacob's qualities of character in terms which would appeal to this audience, namely, his genealogy, beauty, wealth, and the four cardinal virtues-wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice (including humanity, generosity, and honesty), as well as the fifth quality of piety. There were apparent defects in his character that had to be explained or glossed over, notably his deceit in his dealings with his twin brother Esau and with his father-in-law Laban. And yet, if Jacob was to be de- fended, what would be the attitude of the author to his brother Esau, who, it appears, was already in Josephus' time regarded as the ancestor of the Romans, whose protege Josephus was? In Philo's time, two generations before Josephus, the identification of Esau with Rome was apparently not yet widespread, and so Philo had no difficulty in painting Esau in the blackest of terms in contrast to his idealization of Jacob. For Josephus this posed a real dilemma, which he resolved in a threefold way-by diminishing or omitting the alleged defects in Jacob's character, by diminishing or omitting the defects in Esau's character, and by diminishing or omitting the conflict between the two brothers. Thus, for example, he omits the etymology of the name Jacob as "supplanter," which would have imputed to him an undesirably aggressive character. In the scene in which Jacob deceives his father into giving him the blessing he omits Jacob's incriminating statement-an absolute falsehood-"I am Esau, thy first-born," and transfers the blame for the deception entirely to Rebecca, Jacob's mother. A number of touches in his pericope indicate that Josephus, by deft handling of Esau and mostly through omissions, sought to avoid antagonizing the Romans and attempted instead to di- minish the alleged conflict between the two nations, the Jews and 148</page><page sequence="49">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN the Romans, descended from the twins Jacob and Esau. Thus Josephus omits the struggle of the twins within their mother's womb. Moreover, the oracle predicting that Esau would serve Jacob is changed to indicate that Jacob would "excel" Esau. He omits the redness of Esau, which was associated in antiquity with slaves' hair. In the account of the sale of the birthright there is more sympathy for Esau, since, for example, he is described as still a lad. There is more sympathy for Esau because of his tremendous devotion to his father. The bloodiness of Esau is omitted from Isaac's blessing, and instead we are told that he will be renowned for strength in arms and labor. Even with regard to Esau's intermarriages, which in the Bible are a source of such aggravation to Isaac, Josephus says merely that Isaac resolved to hold his peace. On the other hand, the scene in which Jacob and Esau are reconciled becomes central in Josephus. Moreover, par- ticularly in omitting God's promise of land to the Israelites, so dear to the revolutionaries in Josephus' own day and such ana- thema to Josephus and to his Roman patrons, he clearly seeks to ingratiate himself to the Romans. Indeed, the simplest way to explain all of these changes is by postulating that Josephus iden- tified Esau with the Romans and hence was careful not to offend them. Finally, in an effort to make his work more interesting to his readers, who needed purple passages to relieve the monotony of many names and other details, and following in the footsteps of one of his favorite authors, Herodotus, Josephus presents themes familiar to his audience from Homer, from the Greek tragedians, and from Hellenistic novels. Thus he increases the suspense and romantic element in his account of the meeting of Jacob and Rachel, and he heightens the pathos in the account of Jacob's dealings with Laban. Hence, while the Bible in the Septuagint version of Jacob's story is hardly inviting in its style, in Josephus' paraphrase we have a fascinating narrative rivaling the novels which were to become popular in the century after him. In short, in the Jacob pericope Josephus has presented a most readable account that would defend the Jews and would appeal to, and not offend, his Roman audience.102 102 Josephus was confronted with a somewhat similar dilemma in his handling of David. On the one hand, David is the one of the greatest heroes of the Jewish people, but on the other hand, as the ancestor of the Messiah, who presumably would establish an independent Jewish state, he would be anathema to the 149</page><page sequence="50">150 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW We may ask whether the changes in Josephus arose from his following in the Hellenistic historiographical tradition, which de- lighted in dramatizing stories, and from his aesthetic concerns as a storyteller,103 or whether they emanated from his apologetic concern to reconcile the Jews with their Roman overlords. The answer would seem to be that he had both motives in mind. I have, in fact, counted 69 instances (of course, not all of equal importance) where he modified the biblical version of Jacob primarily for the former reason, but no less than 72 instances where he has made changes primarily for the latter reason.104 Romans. Here, too, as I point out in my essay, "Josephus' Portrait of David," Josephus has carefully avoided any hint of the latter role of David. 103 See, in particular, my discussion of Josephus' historiographical predecessors, notably the schools of Isocrates and of Aristotle, in my "Portrait of Saul," pp. 46-52. 104 Indeed, if we compare Josephus' treatment of the brothers Jacob and Esau with his treatment of the brothers Cain and Abel, we see that in the latter case his presentation is influenced by stock motifs and "Hellenizations," as well as regard for apologetic concerns. See my "Hellenizations in Josephus' Portrayal of Man's Decline," Studies in the History of Religions, 14: Religions in Antiquity (Essays in Memory of Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough, ed. by Jacob Neusner (Leiden, 1968), pp. 336-353. Similarly, if we examine apparently similar instances in classical mythology of twins who quarreled, we find that Josephus has constantly added apologetic dimensions. Thus, in the story of the twins Amphion and Zethus we hear of their quarrel about the rival merits of music and hunting, as set forth by Euripides in his lost play Antiope and alluded to by Horace (Epistles 1.18.41-49) and Dio Chrysostom (73.10); but there is nothing of historic and political consequences such as we find in Josephus.</page><page sequence="51">JOSEPHUS' PORTRAIT OF JACOB-FELDMAN ABBREVIATIONS AND BIBLIOGRAPHY "Abraham the Greek Philosopher" "Hellenizations of Esther" "Josephus as an Apologist" "Josephus: the CAqedah" "Portrait of David" "Portrait of Noah" "Portrait of Saul" "Use, Authority" Philo, De congressu "Abraham, the Greek Philosopher in Jo- sephus," Transactions of the American Phil- ological Association 99 (1968): 143-156.
