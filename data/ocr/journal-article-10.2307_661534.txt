For both the artist and the archaeologist this is a work of great importance since it both illustrates in excellent technique, and describes and interprets in Dr. Norden- ski6ld's usual sane scientific style, the archaeology of a region which is but slightly known and on which little has to date been published even in the most technical and obscure scientific monographs. It is a folio volume, of de luxe format and impeccable typography, illustrated with fifty-seven large heliotype plates, of which seven are in natural colors. Includ- ing the thirteen text figures there are one hundred and ninety-one illustrations, al- though in many cases several views of the same specimen are given. A map and bibliography increase its value to the scientist. The text consists of 71 pages. Pages 1-19 are devoted to a general discussion of the archaeology of the Amazon basin, including quotations from the earliest ex- plorers; pages 19-26 to a description of the sites; pages 26-36 to a discussion of the comparative archaeology of these sites; pages 39-63 to a detailed description of the plates; and pages 65-71 to a bibliography and lists. The region discussed includes primarily the lowlands of the lower and central Amazon and the lower portions of its tributaries, but also includes Brazilian Guiana and the Mojos and Beni regions of the upper Madeira in Bolivia. The Matto Grosso region and the headwaters of the Peruvian affluents, such as the Ucayali, where the archaeology is greatly affected by the culture of the Peruvian highlands, are naturally excluded. The specimens illustrated are mainly drawn from the museums and private collections in Europe, South America, and the United States, the larger part, naturally, being in Dr. Nordenski6ld's museum in Goteborg, Sweden, mainly collected by Curt Nimuendajil, to whom the volume is dedicated. The archaeology of this immense region evidently demonstrates many points in common, among which may be mentioned very large pottery vessels, mainly burial urns, generally with anthropomorphic decorations or form. The decoration</page><page sequence="2">434 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 33, 1931 of the pottery is exuberant with high relief, incised, engraved, or painted designs, but without much coloration. Dr. Nordenskiald's scientific deductions may be summarized as follows. The exponents of the highest culture in the Amazon valley and the makers of the excel- lent pottery were probably the Arawak, an inference indicated by the close resem- blance between some of this pottery and that of the Antilles. The use of high relief and incised decoration probably preceded painted designs. These were developed or adopted after the occupation of the Antilles by the Tainan, hence painted decora- tion never reached the West Indies. There were probably two main civilizations characterized by different burial customs. One of these buried in urns, the other directly in the ground or else consumed the ground bones of the dead with their food. These cultures were probably not contemporary. Urn-burial is probably the later custom, since glass beads have been found in some of the urns; it had not spread to the Antilles, where the dead were buried directly in the ground. Also, in a mound on the Rio Beni, interments were found in the lower part, burial mounds in the upper. The closest resemblances with Antillean pottery are found at Santarem, where pottery relief is very high and ornate and burial urns are not found, the popu- lation, according to the earliest historical reports, consuming the pulverized bones of the dead. There is also considerable resemblance between the pottery of San- tarem and that of Panama, Costa Rica, and the Beni and Parant rivers. The an- thropometric form or decoration of the burial urns was probably an influence from the western highlands. As regards the age of these two civilizations, the interments in the mound on the Beni river were evidently contemporary with the Tiahuanaco culture, the upper strata with the burial urns contemporary with the Inca civiliza- tion, and this may afford a clue as to the archaeological periods and sequences in the Amazonian area. The major part of the specimens illustrated are from Maraj6 island and San- tarem. The former group is comparatively well known to students of South Ameri- can archaeology although little illustrative material has heretofore been published upon it. It is to be regretted that some of the unusual specimens from Maraj6 island secured by the late Dr. W. C. Farabee and now in the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania were not included. The Santarem material is most unusual, especially for its Antillean connections, and practically nothing of the type of the several beau- tiful vases here figured has ever before been published. Of exceptional interest also are the stone figures which are most unusual and show affiliations with Colonibia and with Nicaragua, especially the type of human figures with animals on the back and shoulders. Except for two plates, 8, which is upside down, and 25, in which the two San- tarem bowls are reversed from the references to them in the text, I can make no criticism whatever of this excellent and important work.
