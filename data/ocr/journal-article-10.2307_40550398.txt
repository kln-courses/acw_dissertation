The question needs to be asked if one considers at least two of the most representative figures of modernism: Baudelaire and Benjamin. Baudelaire spent a good part of his time for about fifteen years translating the works of Poe. He also spent more than two years translating and adapting De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (1821) and their sequel Suspiria de Pro fundis (1845), which are incorporated in his own Paradis artificiels (1860) under the title "Un Mangeur d'opium."1 Benjamin was also engaged for several years in translation projects, which included Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal and Tableaux parisiens (1923), to which the essay "The Task of the Translator" stands as a preface, and three volumes from Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu.2 Notwithstanding the material concerns that may have prompted this unusual expenditure of time and effort on the part of these two writers - both lived in a state of chronic insolvency, and were dependent on the publishing market to survive - it seems that there was more a stake in their translation ventures than a mere pragmatic interest. 1For a detailed account of Baudelaire's translation of De Quincey's confessions, see Michèle Stäuble-Lipman Wulfs critical edition of "Un Mangeur d'opium" (1976). 2The translation of Proust was made in collaboration with Franz Hessel. Proust's A l'Ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs appeared in German in 1927, and the two volumes of Le Côte de Guermantes were published in 1930.

In both cases, this poetic dependency manifests itself in an addictive use of quotation, which escapes its derivative status by evolving into an original technique of creative appropriation, or rifacimento, to use De Quincey's term.3 Moreover, what is "refashioned" in this process is not just the other's discourse, but the writer's own subjectivity as well. I will argue that in these particular forms of poetic liability, which are, to some extent, part and parcel of the process of writing and literary transmission, one may discern a more insidious form of literary dependency, which is, I believe, specific to these authors, while being at the same time a symptom of modernity at large. I will use Benjamin's essay, "The Task of the Translator" to illuminate the theoretical questions raised by this particular phenomenon, and Baudelaire's Paradis artificiels to explore the consequences that this phenomenon can have for the individual writer. Towards the beginning of his essay on "The Task of the Translator," Benjamin calls the relation between the translation and the original "a natural one, or more specifically, a vital connection" (1969, 71). The original depends on the translation to come into full bloom, and in the process of facilitating this "abundant," though belated "flowering," "the mother tongue of the translator is transformed as well" (Benjamin 1969, 72-73). Although the relation between translation and the original may appear to be one of mutual dependency, it becomes clear, however, that this image of organic harmony is deceptive.4 The original exists, in fact, in an independent sphere, unlike the translation, which has a derivative or attendant status. "Translations," Benjamin argues, "do not so much serve the work as owe their existence to it" (Benjamin 1969, 72). Even more, they turn out to be "superfluous," Unable to reproduce the inherent unity of meaning in the original, the translation "envelops its content like a royal robe with ample folds" (Benjamin 1969, 75), concealing, as it were, its own inadequacy. But something does emerge from this incongruous, ironic relation between translation and original, which has nothing to do with either one.5 This is, according to Benjamin, an intimation of the ultimate "kinship" of all languages, "which is realized only by the totality of their intentions supplementing each other: pure language" (Benjamin 1969, 74). The "embryonic attempt" of making visible this "hidden" significance redeems the inadequacy of the translation, and saves it, in a sense, from ridicule. Benjamin's essay raises some of the issues that preoccupy us here. To displace Benjamin's terms, what can possibly be the relation between modernism and translation? Is it a "natural," "vital" link or 3I discuss this technique and its implications for modernist writing in Clej (1995, 10 &amp; 222-223). For a discussion of natural metaphors in Benjamin's essay, see Jacobs (758). 5The ironic condition of translation posited by Benjamin is discussed by Hamacher (1988, 153-55).</page><page sequence="3">symplokè 9 rather a "superfluous," "ironie" one, or perhaps both? At first glance, nothing should be more uncongenial and distasteful to a modernist writer than translation. Seeing that modernity is bent on claiming its rights to the present as a ground for its absolute originality, it seems at least contradictory that it should be engaged, in any way, in the survival of the past. How can a truculent "denial of history," "a desire to wipe out whatever came earlier," to use Paul de Man's definition of modernity (1983; 148 &amp; 150), coexist with an effort of reviving a past work through translation? Why would "the weaker son," eager to "kill the stronger father" (in Nietzsche's parricidal imagery cited by de Man) be concerned with his resurrection? Yet, what lives on in a translation is not just an individual author, but also, and even more importantly, the Name of the Father, which guarantees the very possibility of language and translation.6 This is what Benjamin calls "translatability," which is "the law governing the translation" (Benjamin 1969, 70). How can the radical, transgressive inclinations of modernity be reconciled with the eminently conservative enterprise of translation, at least in its traditional understanding? How can an activity associated with canon-formation and the reinforcing of the literary status-quo, an activity which betrays the translator's indebtedness to a precursor (be he even a near-contemporary), hold any appeal for the modernist writer? The issue of the translator's "debt," which is only alluded to in Benjamin's essay, is taken up by Derrida in "Des Tours de Babel," his free commentary on "The Task of the Translator." Among the various meanings that the world Aufgabe ("task") can have in German, Derrida chose to focus on a peculiar nuance of the word "duty" (devoir) which this term can take in any of the three languages involved. If the obligation signified by the word "duty" is not projected in the future, as something to be fulfilled, but rather thought of in relation to its source, as something to be desired, then it may well imply a lack, or a "debt," as Derrida puts it.7 This interpretation of the German Aufgabe produces, in turn, the following association "Already at stake," says Derrida, is a law, an injunction for which the translator has to be responsible. He must also acquit himself, and of something In "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man," Benjamin explicitly mentions God as the ultimate "guarantor" for the "objectivity" of any linguistic act (1986, 325). For a discussion of this issue, see Gasché (1988, 89). The crucial role played by the name of God in Benjamin's work is partly an effect of his Kabbalistic readings. See Biale (1982, 139-40). In Derrida's reading of Benjamin, the Name of the Father does not act as an origin but asa response to the human ambition of creating a universal language. He is "at the same time [what] imposes and forbids translation." In stamping the impossible correspondence of tongues (in the figure of Babel), God inevitably makes translation an issue of "duty and debt," but a debt that "one can no longer discharge" (Derrida 1985, 170 &amp; 174).</page><page sequence="4">10 Alina Clej The Debt of the Translator that implies perhaps a fault, a fall, an error and perhaps a crime. (1985, 175) Given an ideal transparency of meaning, the translator is bound to remain unredeemed with respect to the original, and ultimately to the law of translation itself (embodied by the Name of the Father). This insolvency can in turn generate "a sort of 'transference,'" as Derrida puts it, "love and hate, on the part of whoever is in a position to translate" (1985, 176). "The enormous danger inherent in all translations," which Benjamin discusses in relation to Hölderlin, is the extinction of the subject itself, the disappearance of the translator in the toils of his own labors. "The gates of a language thus expanded and modified may slam shut and enclose the translator with silence" (Benjamin 1969, 81). If translation, like the Oral Torah, can represent the "gate of the Lord," the portal or passage that leads to God ("pure language"),8 it may also represent the final obstacle to the awaited revelation, the dead end in which the translator is submerged by language, and reduced to silence. But the relation between modernism and translation is fraught with anxiety, not only because the task of the translator is virtually impossible to fulfill, but also because it signifies, at a deeper ontological level, a withering of experience, an estrangement of the subject from the ground of being. Not unlike Kant in Benjamin's "Program of the Coming Philosophy," the modern subject is faced with "an experience virtually reduced to nadir, to a minimum of significance" (42). Obliged to "map his way through the barren forest of the real,"9 the modernist writer can only relieve his existential poverty through translation, in the artificial "birth pangs" induced by the labor of "ripening the seed of pure language" (Benjamin 1969, 73, 77), and which may only offer the illusory satisfaction of a false pregnancy. It is not just the realization that experience itself is a translation, but also that experience can only designate itself as translation, which provokes the deep melancholy of the modernist. This is, I believe, the unspeakable object of Benjamin's implicit confession in "The Task of the Translator." And it is this which becomes, in his writings on Baudelaire, the explicit object of the discourse of modernity. And yet there is a sense in which translation itself offers a possibility of justification for the modernist writer, insofar as the original is not merely transplanted from one language to another, but is also displaced and appropriated in the process.10 It is this specific 8SeeScholem (1971, 299). This reference is also to Kant, in Benjamin's "Goethe's Wahlverwandtschaften" (1980. 64). 10In Latin, translatio means "transport," "transfer," "transplant," originally of property, merchandise, or armies, and later of spiritual and cultural goods from one language to another (typically from Greek to Latin). The idea of displacement is already inherent in the etymological meaning of the word.</page><page sequence="5">symplokê 11 understanding of translation, as a form of symbolic appropriation, that can definitely engage a modernist writer, especially one suffering from the ontological anxiety that I discussed above.11 There is, moreover, another etymological meaning of translation (Latin, translatio), less obvious perhaps, which designates the juridical act of transferring a blame or a charge on somebody else, and which has, I believe, a lot to do with some of the modernists' interest in translation. In this latter sense the original itself can become a vehicle for the translator's own untold anxieties, and serve as a mode of vicarious confession. Although the vulnerability of the original is never made explicit in Benjamin's essay, the very idea that the translation can displace the original and move it into "a higher and purer linguistic air" - even if this "transfer can never be total" (Benjamin 1969, 75) - suggests an implicit mobility in the original itself. It is this insecurity of the original, its ability of being displaced and uprooted that attracts de Man in his commentary on Benjamin's "The Task of the Translator." "The translation," writes de Man, "canonizes, freezes, an original and shows in the original a mobility, an instability, which at first one did not notice" (de Man 1985, 35). In the act of translation, as de Man asserts, "the original work is not imitated or reproduced but is to some extent put in motion, de-canonized, questioned in a way which undoes its claim to canonical authority." Given this hypothesis, the greater the instability or looseness of a work, the easier it is to disarticulate and reconfigure its language in translation. Baudelaire's translation and adaptation of De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and Suspiria de Profundis in his Paradis artificiels illustrates to what extent translation can become a mode of surrogate creativity, an "alibi" to cover one's lack of inspiration, as well as a form of vicarious confession for the modernist writer.12 This unusual function of translation is facilitated in Baudelaire's case by his theory of translation, which, unlike 11 Although the forms of symbolic appropriation and displacement that I have in mind are in many ways similar to those used by Harold Bloom (1973) to describe the process of poetic production, I view the nature of this phenomenon in very different terms. Modernist writers do not attempt to appropriate and displace a precursor (in this case the original), in order "to clear imaginative space for themselves," but rather to supply a sense of experiential and creative deficiency. As a mode of displacement and devious appropriation, "translation" broadly understood becomes radicalized by avant-garde practices of collage and montage, and later on by the situationist strategy of détournement ("diversion"). 12 According to Claude Pichois, translation for Baudelaire represented an "alibi," a means of compensating for his lack of creativity, as well as a form of self-justification: "A bourgeois guarantee," says Pichois, "meant to reassure his mother, Ancelle, and himself (246). Following Pichois, Baudelaire's "meager vitality," his "vertigo" in front of the blank white page, his fear of being confronted with his own "impotence" forced him into the activity of translation, which provided a prop to his self-confidence. In the case of translation, the score is already given, and the translator's imagination can play along the margins, or weave in and out between the blank spaces of the printed page, like a parasitic plant (See Pichois 254). Translations from the French are mine.</page><page sequence="6">12 Alina Clej The Debt of the Translator Benjamin's, tends to erase the difference between original creation and translation. When in "Correspondances" Baudelaire posits a system of universal analogy, or correspondence, in which signs and things are multiply attuned, and can literally interpolate each other, he implicitly allows for an ideal mediation between all levels of reality, in other words, for unlimited translation. Given this analogical, "hieroglyphic" configuration of the world, Baudelaire can ask "what is a poet . . . if not a translator, a decipherer" (1976: I, 133). Moreover, in a world animated by "confused voices," in which meaning appears to circulate freely, the task of the translator becomes miraculously simple. Not only is the "intention" of the original immediately sensible to the translator, but in a rather extraordinary (and not entirely exhilarating) way he may discover his own intentions reproduced in the specific mode of expression of the original. This is how Baudelaire discovered, to his "horror and delight," as he puts it, thoughts and even expressions that he deemed to be his own already formulated in the works of Poe: Well, now! They accuse me of imitating Edgar Poe. Do you know why I have so assiduously translated Poe? Because he resembles me. The first time that I opened a book of his, I encountered with horror and delight, not only subjects imagined by me, but also EXPRESSIONS that I had conceived, and that he wrote twenty years earlier. (1973: II, 386) In Baudelaire's case, we thus find an unprecedented, and, so to speak, impossible mediation between the translation and the original: the translator reproduces the original, as much as he is reproduced or translated by it. This reciprocity, which for Benjamin was predicated upon the reality of "pure language," is made possible by Baudelaire's concept of "universal analogy" and poetic "prostitution," which define the poet's ability to be "himself and other," after the model of God, whom Baudelaire calls "the most prostituted being" (1976: I, 692). Like a "vagrant soul in search of a body," the poet can haunt or inhabit the other, as if it were a "vacant" space. In the same way he can give himself, this time more like a free body than a soul, to "the unexpected and to the unknown," which in French could also be read as "the stranger passing by" (1976: 1, 291). 13 Baudelaire's desire to be other, to go outside himself, which appears motivated by an intense exasperation, and occasional disgust with his own self, is predicated, however, on a narcissistic identification with the other, which undercuts the possibility of genuine difference.14 Baudelaire's notion of "prostitution," like his practice of intoxication or translation, is based on this paradoxical interplay of sameness and otherness. 13In his Intimate Journals, Baudelaire wrote: "Love is the desire to prostitute oneself. There is no noble pleasure, in fact, that could not be assimilated to Prostitution . . . What is art? Prostitution" (Baudelaire 1976: I. 649) 14Bersani (1977, 10-11 &amp; 106ÍT.) also discusses this contradiction.</page><page sequence="7">symploke 13 It is interesting to note that the possibility of engendering oneself as other, through a form of symbolic prostitution, is likewise present, albeit in a veiled mode, in Benjamin's essay on "The Task of the Translator." The sexual availability of the poet as translator is paralleled in Benjamin by the readiness with which the language of the translation offers itself to the task of "ripening the seed (Samen) of pure language" (Benjamin 1969, 77) and, while rendering visible the sheer otherness of "pure language," comes to discover its own otherness or "foreignness" (Fremdheit) as an individual language. There is moreover a strange similarity between the feminized posture of the translator (or translation), and Schreber, the psychotic doctor, who attracted Benjamin's interest.15 In his delusions, Schreber imagined himself "transformed into a female body" and treated like "a whore," by a number of unspeakable characters, and also by God himself.16 The sexual aspect of his fantasies is matched by a desire to procreate as a woman. This fantasy of procreation is related for Schreber to his role as a redeemer of a world destroyed by a momentous catastrophe. In a similar way, and through a parallel pregnancy fantasy, the translator participates in the ultimate "reconciliation" of tongues, the kabbalistic tikkun, which figures the messianic restoration of all things that had been shattered at the moment of original collision of lights that accompanied creation17 (Scholem 1988, 84). Through the "birth pangs of his own mother tongue, the translator can conjure, albeit through "an embryonic attempt," the Utopian contours of "pure language" (Benjamin 1969, 72-73). 18 With both Benjamin and Baudelaire, the translator is curiously feminized, and the "negative capability" that the activity of translation presupposes resembles a form of prostitution. In a note on Baudelaire's use of empathy (Einfühlung), Benjamin reflects on the attraction between the client and the commodity (which may be said to parallel that between translation and original), and declares Benjamin was well acquainted with Schreber's case, and kept the latter's memoirs in his library on a special shelf reserved for the "mentally ill." See Scholem (1981, 57). See also Benjamin's letter to Scholem (Berlin, 21 July 1925) in Benjamin (1994: I, 279). 16See Schreber (1955). Schreber's case is discussed by Freud in terms of repressed homosexuality ("Psychoanalytic Notes Upon an Authobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia"), and by Lacan, who uses Schreber as an argument for his theory of the unconscious as "the discourse of the Other" {Les Psychoses, Le Séminaire III). The translators and commentators of the English translation of Schreber's memoirs emphasize a relatively neglected syndrome, that of the "pregnancy fantasy," and it is this particular complex that interests me here. One should also note that in Benjamin's vision, "Agesilaus Santander," commented by Scholem, the angel "accosted" Benjamin in its "feminine form." In an earlier essay ("Socrates" [1916]), Benjamin seems to uphold the opposite view: "Just as immaculate conception is for the woman the rapturous notion of purity, so conception without pregnancy is most profoundly the spiritual mark of the male genius." "The existence of the feminine" is necessary only insofar as it guarantees "the asexuality of the spiritual in the world" ("Socrates" 1983-84, 53).</page><page sequence="8">14 Alina Clej The Debt of the Translator that the "virtuoso of this kind of empathy is the prostitute"19 (Benjamin 1972, 1178). But it is precisely because "empathy" in translation may lead to self-reproduction, rather than to a genuine production of otherness, that both Baudelaire and Benjamin advocate the necessity of "shock," as the perfect corrective to the dangers of narcissistic identification, which had initially allowed for the quest of otherness. The moment of shock produces an interruption, a rift in the homogeneity created by the movement of identification, and serves to generate an effect of difference.20 The risk, of course, is that what may be perceived as different and radically "strange" should only be "uncanny" or "bizarre" (one of Baudelaire's favorite epithets) - that is, a disguised, frightening resurrection of the same. This danger inherent in translation becomes apparent when Baudelaire talks about intoxication, which is supposed to function as a "fertilizing instrument" (instrument fécond) and as a conceptual generator (machine à penser), but can turn out to be a mere cloning device (Baudelaire 1976: I, 440). If the use of stimulants (wine and hashish) may act as a "means of multiplication of the self," and as a form of imaginary empowerment, their result can be as illusory as the intoxication spell itself. The alienating substance meant to produce a Verfremdungseffekt - a qualitative difference as well as distance within the subject - "reveals," in the end, "nothing but the individual itself." The proliferation and expansion of the subject induced by intoxication do not engender a new entity, but only a monstrous reduplication of the self - the same individual in "an exponential, excessive" form. Dreaming of becoming the absolute Other (God), Baudelaire discovers at the bottom of his dream, in its "luminous abyss," his own "Narcissus face" (Baudelaire 1976: I, 440). In the "magnifying glass" of the hashish intoxication the subject finds itself "enchained" to its own self in a "horrible marriage" bond (Baudelaire 1976: 1, 427), or as De Quincey put it, "a slave . . . not less abject than Caliban to Prospero" (De Quincey 1890, 230). The dream of liberating power ends up in abject subjection: the master discovers, as in Hegel's fable, that he is the slave. If in Baudelaire's case the possibility of recreating oneself as other through the "dangerous, delicious gymnastics" of intoxication (or translation) can always backfire, Benjamin seems to have circumvented the threat of sameness or sterile self-reproduction by positing a "non-sensuous similarity," which is the very opposite of mimetic likeness20 (Benjamin 1986, 333-36). "To grasp the genuine relationship between an original and a translation," Benjamin writes, "requires an investigation analogous to the argumentation by which a critique of cognition would have to prove the impossibility of an image theory . . . Here it can be demonstrated that no translation would be possible if in its ultimate essence it strove for likeness to the original" 19For a discussion of femininity and prostitution in Benjamin's work, see Buci- Glucksmann (107ff). See also Werner Hamachers discussion of "non-sensuous likeness" (152-155).</page><page sequence="9">symplokê 15 (Benjamin 1969, 73). The danger of narcissistic identification is preempted, in Benjamin, by a rejection of specularity as the ground for any kind of speculative operation. Narcissus has to immolate himself in order to re-emerge as Echo, or as disembodied voice. And even if the translator in the guise of Echo cannot initiate an actual act of communication, he can at least experience the intoxicating feeling of otherness produced by the distance, or "non-sensuous" similarity, between the translation and the original. In Benjamin's words, "unlike a work of literature, translation does not find itself in the center of the language forest but on the outside facing the wooded ridge; it calls into it without entering, aiming at that single spot where the echo is able to give, in its own language, the reverberation of the work in the alien one" (Benjamin 1969, 76). But through a strange twist, not only does the echo seem to efface the origin of the sound, but in this purely vocal exchange, the identity of sound is somehow forgotten. This act of concealment and disappearance of identities that may take place in translation, even on Benjamin's terms, was peculiarly appealing to Baudelaire. The declared aim of Baudelaire's translation of De Quincey's confessions was to create an ideal fusion, or "amalgam," as he calls it, between his own poetic self and that of De Quincey, so that the distinction between the two would fade: "I would be at a loss," Baudelaire says, "to determine what dose of my personality I have introduced into the original author. I have made such an amalgam that I would no longer be able to tell which part comes from me, but in any event this can only be negligible"21 (Baudelaire 1976, I: 519). Baudelaire's metaphors ("dose," "amalgam") suggest a chemical or rather alchemical reaction through which the subject of the original and the translator merge. Baudelaire's own self is thus concealed, effaced in the other, and becomes in a sense unrecognizable. The image of the "amalgam" also suggests the possibility of creating a new entity out of this hybrid union between translation and original, "a third person," as it were, which may be described in terms of a "mystic operation." This is the term that Baudelaire uses to describe the supernatural union that occurs in the process of intoxication, in which "natural man and wine... play the roles of the Father and the Son in the Trinity, and engender the Holy Spirit, which is the superior man, who originates in equal measure in both" (1976, I: 387). In this imaginative product, similar in ways to the supersensuous essence of Benjamin's "pure language," the actual source of creativity can no longer be distinguished. The "vaporization" involves both the translation and the original, and the finished product - the "fusion" created in the process of translation - ends up resembling the "phantom-like objectivity" of the commodity, We find a similar formulation in one of Baudelaire's letters to his editor (Poulet- Malassis): "Moreover I had to blend my own personal sensations with the opinions of the original author in order to create an amalgam in which the parts would be indistinguishable" (1973: I, 669).</page><page sequence="10">16 Alina Clej The Debt of the Translator to use Marx's expression, in which individual labor is "congealed" or "crystallized," that is, rendered invisible (Marx 128). In translating and adapting De Quincey's opium confessions, Baudelaire is able not only to conceal his own lack of creative energy, of which he so often complained in his letters, but also to confess, through De Quincey's intermediary, his own prodigality, the excesses and despondency which inhibited his work. And this kind of vicarious confession is made possible by the instability and porous nature of the original, which I mentioned before. De Quincey himself was particularly sensitive to the formal deficiencies of his own work, and sought to correct them by incessant revisions, which only threw him further away from what he was trying to achieve. Defending his intentions against Coleridge's accusations of reckless opium consumption, De Quincey simultaneously reveals the shortcomings of his work: "Since no man surely, on a question of my own private experience, could have pretended to be better informed than myself. Or, if there really is such a person, perhaps he will not think it too much trouble to re- write these Confessions from first to last, correcting their innumerable faults; and, as it happens that some parts of the unpublished sections for the present are missing, would he kindly restore them . . . filling up all those chasms which else are likely to remain as permanent disfigurations of my work." This is the very task which Baudelaire had set for himself. Through his translation and commentary, Baudelaire sought to rewrite De Quincey's confessions and rectify what De Quincey called the "permanent disfigurations" of his "little work."22 Baudelaire's translation is, however, more than a rigorous adaptation of the original. Having given up an intended project on opium which was to complement his essay on hashish, he chose instead to translate and adapt De Quincey's own confessions, in order to complete his work on the pleasures and dangers of intoxication, Les Paradis artificiels. As I will try to show, by translating De Quincey's confessions, Baudelaire is not only completing his own unfinished work, but also performing an indirect confession. There is one aspect of De Quincey's Confessions to which Baudelaire was particularly attracted, and which points, I believe, to the implicit object of his indirect confession, and this is the problem of voice. In his own confessions, De Quincey is obsessed with figures of voice, with movements of rising and falling, which produce both acoustic and scriptural motions. The ultimate nightmare for him is that of an irretrievable loss of voice, or lapse into silence, "the deep" in which language closes on the poet. Evoking his struggle with "the dark idol" of opium in his introduction to his Suspiria de Pro fundis, This is how Baudelaire described the so-called difficulty of his task in a letter to his editor: "De Quincey is a horribly casual and prolix writer and it was not easy to give a dramatic form and introduce order in the abridged version [of his confessions]" (Baudelaire 1973: I, 669).</page><page sequence="11">symplokê 17 De Quincey writes: "The voice perishes; the gestures are frozen; and the spirit of man flies back upon its center. I, at least, upon seeing those awful gates closed and hung with draperies of woe, as for a death already past, spoke not, nor started, nor groaned. One profound sigh ascended from my heart, and I was silent for days" (De Quincey 1985, 91). Commenting on this passage, Baudelaire observes in a somewhat self-righteous tone that "despair is mute," and that De Quincey's title "Suspiria de Profundis" aptly describes the condition of the opium eater (which also happens to be the plight of the hashish eater himself). As we shall see, dumbness is for Baudelaire the proper punishment for the prodigal writer. What is noticeable in both De Quincey's and Baudelaire's cases is the link between voice and will, a link which, as Derrida suggested in Speech and Phenomena emphasizes the importance of vouloir dire, and its deep ties with a metaphysics of the will.23 The preoccupation with will and lack of will, with a master-slave dynamic, already manifest in De Quincey's Confessions, takes on a special emphasis in Baudelaire's Paradis artificiels,24 in which intoxication and discipline hold equal, but opposite, claims over the management ("hygiene") of the self. Although Baudelaire considers drugs a "means of multiplying the personality, he has to admit that they represent a disreputable "hygiene," a "dangerous exercise," as he calls it, recalling Rousseau's "dangerous supplement," through the Biblical image of prodigality: "Here you are" says Baudelaire, admonishing the imaginary reader, "incapable of work or of energetic action. This is the punishment for the impious prodigality with which you have squandered the nervous fluid. You have disseminated your personality to the winds, and now how difficult it is to gather it again and concentrate it!" (Baudelaire 1976: I, 395). The most urgent problem for Baudelaire remains that of "the vaporization and condensation of the Self7 (Baudelaire 1976: I, 676), in other words, of how to expand or exceed oneself, without losing one's self. Baudelaire's mixed feelings of attraction and revulsion toward both intoxication and prostitution, which express at a deeper level his desire and fear of losing his self, take a particularly vivid form in Les Paradis artificiels. The wasting or spilling of vital substances ("the nervous fluid"), and the lethargy which follows the self-inflicted ecstasy, are also suggested by the iconography of addiction, in which Dürer's Melancholia plays a significant part. In her book Opium and the 23"For if intentionality never simply meant will," Derrida observes, "it certainly does seem that in the order of expressive experiences . . . Husserl regards intentional consciousness and voluntary consciousness as synonymous. We would perhaps have to conclude that, in spite of all the themes of receptive or intuitive intentionality and passive genesis, the concept of intentionality [vouloir dire] remains caught up in the tradition of a voluntaristic metaphysics - that is, perhaps, in metaphysics as such" (Derrida 1973, 34).

What they have in common is the image of a despondent woman holding a compass in Dürer, then a compass and an empty goblet, and finally a hypodermic syringe.25 The last substitution is, in fact, predictable. Both the compass and the syringe represent instruments of inscribing - with a difference, though. While the compass, or the pen, is used for outward tracing, the syringe interjects the writing. What appears to be an active projection of the imagination in the opium trance is actually a passive act, an uncovering of something already written in the recesses of the mind. In this process of unveiling, opium plays the role of a reactive, as can be seen from Baudelaire's rendering of De Quincey's opium experiences: "Just as the drowning man reviews, in the supreme moment of agony, his whole life, as in a mirror... or the stars veiled by the light of day reappear at night, in the same way all the inscriptions engraved on his unconscious memory reappear, as by the effect of an invisible ink" (Baudelaire 1976: I, 481). Under the effect of opium, man no longer writes, but is written; he no longer speaks, but is spoken, as De Quincey seems to suggest in his praise of opium: "Oh! just, subtle, and mighty opium! eloquent opium!" an effect which foreshadows the surrealists' later experiments with automatic writing. But this extraordinary, almost supernatural, form of expression or writing induced by intoxication is for Baudelaire a source of profound distress. "All this phantasmagoria," Baudelaire says, commenting on De Quincey's opiate visions, "beautiful and poetic as it may seem, was accompanied by a deep anguish and a dark melancholy" (Baudelaire 1976: I, 480). Baudelaire's excessive, tautological figure - "dark melancholy" - is a vivid image for the negative chemical reaction that takes place in the mind of the opium (or hashish) eater. The magic of the "invisible ink," its subtle alchemy, has turned sour; its ethereal substance has coagulated into the thick, black ink of melancholy that now clogs the fine machinery of the brain. If opium originally stimulated the languishing powers of the imagination, it ends up by inhibiting them. The melancholic figure (inspired by Dürer) that decorates the title page of Baudelaire's translation of Poe's Tales is a graphic representation of the condition of the poet as addict and translator. In his Poème du haschisch, Baudelaire made it quite clear that he did not want to write a "work of pure physiology, but rather one of morals, meant to denounce the "artificial ideal" of intoxication, through "an analysis of the mysterious effects and morbid pleasures engendered by drugs" (Baudelaire 1976: I, 403). In writing the Paradis artificiels, he was thus playing the role of an angry father 25Baudelaire mentions, in fact, the not too conspicuous syringe that lies on the floor in Dürer's painting in connection to Michelet's interpretation of Melancholia in his History of France. See "L'Art Philosophique" (Baudelaire 1976: II, 600).</page><page sequence="13">symploke 19 chastising a prodigal son (De Quincey), and implicitly himself for a lack of energy and manly determination. In this light, it is not surprising that Baudelaire should endorse the conservative values of the capitalist world, in which productivity and discipline are the only esteemed forms of behavior. The opium (or hashish) cult is condemned by Baudelaire for being an "obscene heresy," "a monstrous religion" that leads to a "dilapidation of one's own resources" (Baudelaire 1976: I, 433). To the prodigal economy of the opium (or hashish) eater, Baudelaire opposes an alternative model of thrift and concentration - a healthy "regime" - based on the adult value of work. "The condensation (centralization) of the self," seems to take precedence over its "vaporization." Like money and "nervous fluids" (not to mention seminal ones), the creative will has to be kept intact, or else judiciously managed. Baudelaire's translation and adaptation of De Quincey's opium confessions in Un Mangeur d'opium was obviously conceived as an act of penance for the "impious prodigality," and the "guilty orgies of the imagination" of the hashish-eater (Baudelaire 1976: I, 395, 402), as a kid of apologue whose bad example was to be De Quincey. The translation functions as a punitive instrument, and, as such, it naturally upholds the values of the patriarchal order which Baudelaire both resented and wished to be part of. The ideals of potency and control, and their opposites become an obsessive theme in Baudelaire's work, while De Quincey stands for the "feminized," impotent creator, who is unable "to cross the barrier that separates the imaginary campaigns of daydreaming from the positive harvests of action" (Baudelaire 1976: I, 479). In his introductory remarks to his translation, Baudelaire declares: I will have no doubt to condense a lot. De Quincey is an essentially digressive author... At one point, he compares his thought to a thyrsus, a simple stick, which gains all its character and charm from the complicated foliage which envelops it. Given the limited space that I have at my disposal, and so that the reader does not lose any of the moving tableaux that form the substance of his volume, I will, to my regret, be obliged to suppress . . . many exquisite disquisitions . . . that are not immediately related to the subject of opium, but are only meant to illustrate the character of the opium eater. (Baudelaire 1976: 1, 444). By trimming the lushness of De Quincey's language, by reducing it to a sense of order, Baudelaire emphasizes his own phallic creativity, which felt threatened by his various addictions, while masking at the same time his "feminine" position as a translator. In the "Conclusion" to "Un Mangeur d'opium," Baudelaire declares, echoing De Quincey, that "the subject [of De Quincey's confessions] - [i.e. opium] - has no other value but that of a dry, naked stick; but, through their playful interweaving, the ribbons and</page><page sequence="14">20 Alina Clej The Debt of the Translator floral ornaments can constitute a precious richness for the eye" (Baudelaire 1976: I, 515). In a similar way, the dissipation and wanton prodigality of the opium imagination, which may be compared to the "ribbons and floral ornaments" that decorate the thyrsus, can be recuperated under the aegis of the law or canon represented here by the "naked stick."26 What Baudelaire erects through his translation is the power of the canon-"translatability" or "the law governing the translation"-under whose cover he can secretly reenact the "guilty excesses" of the opium eater, even as he openly condemns them. The image of the thyrsus, which stands as a metaphor for De Quincey's work, may also describe Baudelaire's work of translation - a curiously hybrid product, in which transgression and the law, masculinity and femininity are uneasily conjoined.27 If Baudelaire succeeds in refashioning himself by reducing De Quincey to a histrionic mask, De Quincey's halting voice continues to haunt the poet's work. I would like in conclusion to look briefly at Baudelaire's poem "Obsession," in which Baudelaire's relation to De Quincey and ultimately to translation is vividly played out.28 Paul de Man analyzed this poem in his essay "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," and for some reason missed, or else chose to ignore, the poem's insistent allusions to De Quincey. He preferred to give Baudelaire's poem an internal source in "Les Correspondances," emphasizing the self-referential and intratextual nature of Baudelaire's practice, in other words, reading it as an instance of self-translation, rather than of translation. According to de Man, the relation between what he calls the "neo- classical Correspondances'" and the "post-romantic' Obsession'" is one of "complimentarity" (de Man 1984, 253). "The two sonnets complement each other like the two halves of a symbolon" (254), an image that de Man will later use to describe the relation between translation and original in his reading of Benjamin's essay on "The Task of the Translator" (de Man 1985, 42). From the perspective of self-translation, de Man can describe the "howling woods" at the beginning of "Obsession" as a "naturalization" of the neoclassical "forest-temple" in the "Correspondances." And yet, he is unable to explain the grammatical address ("you, vous") in Baudelaire's apostrophe. 26 In its etymological meaning, "canon" (Gk. kanon from kanna) designates a "reed" or "stick," a figure which - in the form of a thyrsus - dominates Baudelaire's translation of De Ouincev. 27Baudelaire develops the aesthetic implications of the thyrsus figure in his prose poem, "Le Thyrse," dedicated to Franz Liszt. This image is analyzed at length by Marc Eigeldinger (172-183) and Susan Guerlac (78-93). Both Eigeldinger and Guerlac discuss the relation between opposite principles in Baudelaire's image of a thyrsus. I tend to agree with Guerlac, who views the work of amalgamation "not as dialectical resolution but as force or tension" (122). 28Stäuble-Lipman Wulf (84-85) has already mentioned a number of poetic images in "Obsession" that recall De Quincey's Suspiria de Profundis.</page><page sequence="15">symplokê 21 Grand bois, vous m'effrayez comme des cathédrales; Vous hurlez comme l'orgue; et dans nos coeurs maudits, Chambres d'éternel deuil où vibrent de vieux râles, Répondent les échos de vos De profundis. "We are all frightened by the windy woods," de Man says, "but do not generally make a spectacle of ourselves talking to tress" (de Man 1984, 255). A closer look at Baudelaire's text, shows, however, that there is nothing "natural" about the howling woods in "Obsession." De Man was able to speak about the figure of "naturalization" precisely because Baudelaire (and, inadvertently, de Man himself) had eliminated De Quincey's presence from the "howling woods." Baudelaire is, in fact, speaking to somebody - this is why the sonnet has a dialogic form - and this invisible figure is obviously De Quincey. There is no dearth of clues in this respect; Michèle Stäuble- Lipman Wulf has already pointed out some of the most significant allusions to the English writer's work, without commenting, however, on the implications of these borrowings for Baudelaire's own writing. Here are some of the most telling clues: the poem "Obsession" was written in 1860, shortly after the completion of the Paradis artificiels, and was originally preceded by a Greek motto - Aeschylus' lines "O multitudinous laughter of the ocean billows" - which appears in De Quincey's Suspiria de Profundis. The first stanza literally designates this source, seeing that the "howling woods" intone the italicized name of De Quincey's work - De Profundis. The "howling" wind in the woods comes from the summer day outside the death-chamber where De Quincey's sister is lying in state (the chapter is entitled "The Affliction of Childhood," in Suspiria de Profundis). As De Quincey was standing between the open window and the dead body of his sister, "a solemn wind began to blow... Mournful! that is saying nothing. It is a wind that had swept the fields of mortality for a hundred centuries" (De Quincey 1985, 105). And it is this "hollow, solemn, Memnonian, but saintly swell," which comes to represent for De Quincey "the one sole audible symbol of eternity." In this sense, de Man is right to view the howling of the wind in Baudelaire's sonnet as an "aural metonymy for death," but the "attribution of speech to the woods" is more than an anthropomorphic figure, since what speaks through them is De Quincey's voice. What is striking from the very beginning, and may lead us to the nature of Baudelaire's "obsession," is the multiplication of "referents" in Baudelaire's poem: the unique chamber of death in which De Quincey experienced the traumatic loss of his sister is transformed into "chambers of eternal mourning," corresponding to the "damned souls." The specificity of reference would still be preserved if the plural were understood as a duality designating Baudelaire and De Quincey. One may then say that, through his translation, Baudelaire has come to experience the same pain as De Quincey, his "brother in spirit," as he calls him, or that their souls ravaged by addiction are</page><page sequence="16">22 Alina Clej The Debt of the Translator vibrating in unison with the "howling woods." But since De Quincey's voice never emerges from its anonymity, the plural forms displace the concrete reference into a space of impersonal or universal suffering. But the proliferation of signs ("chambers," "souls," "eternal mourning") in Baudelaire's poem may also derive from De Quincey's description of his opium nightmares, in which painful experiences were multiplied in infinite numbers. But unlike other statements which suggest Baudelaire's exhilaration with the possibility of "multiplying" the self (as a result of intoxication or prostitution), "Obsession" presents the horrifying aspects of this phenomenon. The multiplication of sounds appears to be particularly painful for Baudelaire, an effect which is oddly reminiscent of Benjamin's horror of noise, his "noise psychosis," as he called it (Scholem 1981, 25). The miserable heart of the poet (the plural nos clearly includes him) already ravaged by "old groans" (vieux râles) is now racked with the "echoes" triggered by the "howling woods" (its "Suspiria"). Their vibration is terrifying, like that of an infernal organ (the "woods" themselves are compared to "cathedrals"). In the second stanza, the torment of sound takes on almost hyperbolic proportions with the "enormous laughter of the sea." What was for De Quincey, in Suspiria de Profundis, only a semblance of laughter ("phantoms of gaiety"), an inadequate sign of his tormenting pain, becomes for Baudelaire an actual laughter filled with "sobs and insults" from which he desperately wants to escape. It is the laughter of the "defeated man" (l'homme vaincu), the specter of impotence that he sought to exorcise by translating De Quincey's confessions. Baudelaire's dream of engendering himself as other through translation ends up in a terrifying vision, in which sameness is infinitely multiplied through the waves of the ocean, hence neither other nor same, like a mockery of their difference. Even more, the "bitter laughter" of De Quincey (Vhomme vaincu) is now directed at Baudelaire's own defeat, at the latter's sad inability to express himself - his own words come out like the groans of a moribund (vieux râles) - or even to experience De Quincey's pain. If the subject of "Obsession" is lyrical voice, it is not its vigorous "assertion" that Baudelaire's sonnet proclaims, as de Man argues, but quite the opposite, its failure to assert itself. Baudelaire's own faltering voice is drenched in "the multitudinous laughter of the ocean billows," Aeschylus' lines, quoted in De Quincey's original, which Baudelaire, whose Greek was shaky, evidently failed to comprehend.29 In the third stanza, Baudelaire seems to recover his own voice, but it is only through a gesture of supreme denial, by rejecting language altogether, and by welcoming "the void, the dark, and the barren," in which the twinkle of familiar signs has been definitively extinguished. In the last stanza, the empty backdrop against which 29See Baudelaire 1973: I, 664.</page><page sequence="17">symplokë 23 the solitary actor is preparing to perform his silent play is itself denied, as glimmering signs resurface out of the dark pupils of the poet. "Beings who have disappeared" look back at him through his own eyes with "familiar glances." The image of De Quincey that Baudelaire had been trying to erase all along resurfaces from within, brought about by his involuntary memory, which undoes the work of repression.30 The translator cannot escape the original because it now inhabits him. Images of "spatial enclosure," such as "room, tomb, or crypt," in which the voice echoes as in a cave, represent the particular condition of the poet translator, who can only speak through the voice of the other. This explains, I believe, the abundance of these images in Baudelaire's work. They evoke not so much the horror of being buried alive, as in Poe's story, but that of being already dead and visited by fleeting memories from the world of the living. Yet in a paradoxical way, the translator is not only imprisoned by, but also excluded from, the original. In "Obsession," the poet's voice, such as it is, comes from a locus of pure exteriority, and is unable to attach itself to any of the objects that it evokes. The ultimate horror is that there is no experience to speak of, no lived memory, but only "poems," which are all illegitimately inspired by the other. And yet, the painful experience of the poet translator can only designate itself through translation. With every new gesture that he makes, Baudelaire is consciously reproducing a previous gesture, whether De Quincey's or his own. Like De Quincey's figure in "The Apparition of the Brocken," who repeats or mimics every movement of the subject, Baudelaire is turned into a "phantom." De Quincey compared the "Specter of the Brocken" (an atmospheric phenomenon in the mountains of Northern Germany) to the "Dark Interpreter" who appeared in his dreams: "the dark symbolic mirror for reflecting to the daylight what else must be hidden for ever" (De Quincey 1985, 156). Baudelaire becomes precisely this "reflex," the interpreter interpreted, since it is only by reading De Quincey that we can understand some of Baudelaire's later "broken" poetic gestures.31 But it is precisely the consciousness of inescapable reenactment and the desire to extinguish all memory which constitute the essential modernity of Baudelaire's poem. Baudelaire's dream is to abolish memory altogether ("poetic memory" and its "torments"), to incinerate it, and to "recreate a delirium without a past," to use Eluard's expression. In "Obsession," memory is clearly consumed, reduced to cinders, in order to become a dark, flat "screen" on which the subject can endlessly project his spurious fantasies, a "magic For a discussion of involuntary memory in Baudelaire, see Turnell (184) and Burton (174). For a different reading of the reflections and echoes in "Obsession," see Reed (254-255).</page><page sequence="18">24 Alina Clej The Debt of the Translator lantern" meant to "divert the boredom of our prisons" ("Le Voyage").32 Experience had turned into pure simulacrum. There are, however, certain sensitive points in Baudelaire's "Obsession" where the phantom voice seems to resonate unusually, where the masquerade dissolves. These are the moments in which terror and hate acquire almost hyperbolic proportions as if to respond to the enormous laughter of the original. What manages to pierce through the sudden tumefaction of signs is Baudelaire's real anguish, his bitter resentment, which was vainly trying to find a voice of its own. It is this desperate insolvency that Baudelaire communicates in his letter to his editor, with its expression of profound lassitude and shame over being unable to repay his debts, along with the hope that his translation will sell well. "Les Paradis artificiels" would be "a good title for marketing [the book]" (Baudelaire 1973, 1: 666). It is the characteristic feeling of the translator, which Benjamin himself knew only too well. Baudelaire's poem "Obsession" could also stand as an epilogue to the "Task of the Translator," the preface to Benjamin's translation of Baudelaire. Like Baudelaire's poet, the translator in Benjamin's essay stands on the skirts of the language-forest in a clearing, as it were, teasing out the linguistic density of the original, in order to elicit a reverberating echo in his own language. And yet Benjamin can only designate this experience of distance by means of an image that comes from Baudelaire, whether that of the "forests of symbols" in "Correspondances" or of the "howling woods" in "Obsession." Like Kant, or Baudelaire himself, Benjamin knows only too well that "he is mapping his way through the barren forest of the real," but he can at least make believe that the "forest of symbols" is teeming with life. "The primeval forest" that he imagines in the middle of the city (in A Berlin Chronicle) can only be conjured at the limit, in moments of imagined or real exposure, and especially when "crossing frontiers" from the fashionable, secure district of his class into the "exotic world of abject poverty" (Benjamin 1986, 11). Standing on the "edge of the void" - the "threshold" where the world of prostitutes opens up with their appeal of voluptuousness and death - the young bourgeois, like the mature translator, awaits for his illumination on the brink. "The original has already relieved the translator and his translation of the effort of assembling and expressing what is to be conveyed" (Benjamin 1969, 78). Benjamin's concept of translation seems predicated on this desire of giving up the burden of communication, or perhaps on the very absence of a desire to communicate. The translator's debt will never be acquitted, since it is already canceled in the anticipation of "pure language." "In this pure language," Benjamin tells us, "which no longer means or expresses anything but 32See Poulet (54). The theatrical metaphor is frequently used by Baudelaire, as it was in fact by De Quincey, to describe the effects of intoxication.

Translation thus appears as the inescapable horizon of modernity from which experience attempts to both regain itself and escape into pure nothingness.
