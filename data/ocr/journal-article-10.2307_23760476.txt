<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes Illegal woodcutting causes alarming damage to the Maya biosphère reserve in the Peten rain forest MERIDA (Diario de Yucatan/Siglo XXI). The Maya bio sphère reserve in the rainforest area close to the Mexican border of the Guatemalan department El Peten has been subjected to an alarming degree of damage. The damage has been caused by illegal woodcutting promoted on both the Guatemalan and Mexican sides of the border. According to newspaper reports, illegal woodcutters apparently enjoy the protection of Guatemalan military and legal authorities. Due to violence on the part of these crimináis and to the oft impenetrable forest, it is very difficult for employées of the Ministry of Finance and other organizations to protect the rain forest. For the most part, their efforts are in vain, because persons arrested are usually released on bail soon. In Decem ber 1992, a journalist and a group of ecological activists accompanying him were beaten by a group of illegal woodcut ters and by members of the Guatemalan army. Although arrest warrants were issued the same month, the attackers are still free and left undisturbed by the authorities. Members of the National Commission for Protected Areas of Guatemala (CONAP, Comisión Nacional de Áreas Protegidas de Guate mala) calcúlate that an illegal woodcutter may earn US $ 10,000 a day by carrying off three truckloads of wood daily. These | profits permit the crimináis to buy off authorities or to pay the required fines or bails easily, if they get arrested. Investigation of Structure 216 of Yaxhá GUATEMALA CITY (B.Hermes/G.Galindo). Between March and June of 1991 the National Project of Tikal (Projecto Nacional Tikal) began with the investigation of Structure 216 at the archaeological site of Yaxhá (Fig. 1). The structure, which occupies the eastern part of the East Acrópolis, is more than 30 meters high and consists of a pyramidal base of at least seven steps and a two-roomed temple building on top, the highest point of the whole archaeological site. Excavation work focused on the exterior of the northern side of the temple and on the northern part of the frontal Chamber of the same structure. The Chamber was found totally filled with fallen nibble from the roof and the frontal wall of the building. Two accesses - one situated in the center and the other in the extreme north - were reconstructed during excavation, and even without having excavated the extreme southem part of the Chamber, it seems convenient to suppose that, originally, there had been three accesses to the frontal Chamber.</page><page sequence="2">wearing clothing but has hair on his head. The following person shows, beside hair, a headdress that falls onto his back. He is completely dressed and carnes on his breast a longish object. The ninth individual appears to be the principal actor of the scene. He is richly dressed, carries a large headdress, a long cape, and possibly some kind of kilt. In front of him is something he seems to be touching. Each of the individuáis of the couple next to him carries an object that seems to represent a banner. They wear small caps or headdresses, a kilt-like dress, and a small string around their hips. The last person in the scene wears a small triangular cap or headdress, and holds in front of his mouth an object that seems to represent a large trumpet. From his belt are hanging strings that may represent cloth Ornaments. The tenain on which the scene of the "pro cession" happens to play exhibits marked features that suggest Fig. 1.

Construction of the new Metro line brings to light Prehispanic and Colonial archaeological remains MEXICO CITY (La Jornada). Dozens of archaeological arte facts and remains of the Prehispanic and Colonial periods have been discovered during construction work on the Metro's new Line 8 in Mexico-City. Among the finds are jewellery, burials, remains of pyramidal structures, and monuments of Aztec civilization. Colonial structures have also been found. Ac cording to INAH, all the artefacts and remains recovered in salvage excavations carried out by experts have been thor oughly studied and deposited in différent muséums of the Mexican capital. Construction work had to be interrupted on several occasions. In addition to Prehispanic and Colonial remains, large numbers of bones belonging to mammoths and other prehistoric animais have been found. Ancient Maya sculpture at new locations CAMPECHE (A. Benavides). Because of its volume and weight, ancient Maya sculpture requires special handling as well as sufficient space for conservation and display. In two important projects the regional centres of INAH in Merida and Campeche have recently made several Maya sculptures acces sible to the general public. In Merida, a number of Maya pieces Fig. 2.
