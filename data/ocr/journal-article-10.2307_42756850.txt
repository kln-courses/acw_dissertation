<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ann. Bot. 50, 285-289, 1982 Book Reviews Fitter, A. H. and Hay, R. K. M. Environmental Physiology of Plants, xii + 355 pp. 23 X 15 cm. 1981. Academic Press, London. £7.95 (softback). It must be generally agreed that there is an outstanding need for a new, reasonably priced text on the ecological physiology of plants. The undoubtedly valuable volume by Larcher, Physiological Plant Ecology , has its limitations, some of them summarized by H. W. Woolhouse in J. exp. Bot. 27, 1112. P. Bannister's text, Introduction to Physiological Ecology has some particularly useful sections, but is also frustrating in many ways. J. P. Grime's Plant Strategies and Vegetation Processes presents a stimulating personal point of view, but does not pretend to deal critically with the physiological aspects as such. The recent Physiological Processes in Plant Ecology ( Towards a Synthesis with Atriplex) by C. B. Osmond, O. Bjorkman and D. J. Anderson contains some superb chapters, but also others of less general interest, and is for too expensive for students. In contrast, J. R. Etherington's modestly priced Plant Physiological Ecology is intended only as a very condensed introduction. The most recent of the relevant North American texts, Terrestrial Plant Ecology by M. G. Barbour et al. is intended to cover a broader field. And so we look with hope to the new text by Fitter and Hay, said to be for second and third year undergraduates. The authors state in the Preface that their book is intended to answer the question 'How do the intricate physiological mechanisms which have been elucidated over the last 100 years by plant physiologists really operate under natural conditions'. The environment is approached in two ways: as a source of energy and materials, and as a collection of potentially damaging 'stresses'. There are eight chapters. The first is intended to provide an account of 4 the ecological and evolutionary framework within which plants operate'. The next three deal with acquisition of resources: light, mineral nutrients and water. The last four are devoted to the responses of plants to environmental 'stresses': temperature, ionic toxicity, gaseous toxicity and interactions between organisms. To my mind the last four chapters are the most successful in the sense that they provide reasonably sound, up-to-date accounts without too many obvious lacunae. I think many undergraduates will find them useful. The first four chapters are much less attractive, and of them I would recommend to students only Chapter 3, which provides a neat summary of the work by S. A. Barber, P. H. Nye and P. B. Tinker and their associates on the supply of mineral nutrient ions from the soil to the root. There are three major faults. First, there is no attempt to deal critically with the basic question in quotation marks above; the authors fail to convey the difficulties of adequate experimentation in the field (the 'inaccessibility of the plant' as G. C. Evans has called it) or the need to live with the plant night and day through the year in order to understand it, as H. Walter has emphasized. Secondly, the background of reference is too limited; the book is really about plants in northwestern and central Europe, with occasional reference to North America and the Arctic. Thirdly, the presentation is based on the unacceptable principle that plants have somehow been 'optimized' during evolution. There is little more I can say about the first of these points, but it is important to expand on the second and third. To my mind it is unreasonable to entitle a book Environmental Physiology of Plants without any intention of making adequate reference to plants of tropical rain forest or semi-desert. A high proportion of the few remarks that are made about these plants would have been better left unwritten. Thus, the discussion of the</page><page sequence="2">286 Book Reviews importance of C4 plants in the tropics on p. 63 may leave the unwary student thinking that tropical rain forests are cram-packed with C4 trees, whereas in fact none is known there. On p. 20 we are told of dipterocarps that approach 100 m in height, whereas the tallest known reach only 80 m, and more typically they reach only 30-60 m. In the section on ultraviolet light in Chapter 2, no mention is made of the fact that the radiation received in u.v. wavelengths in the lowlands increases markedly toward the equator. The arguments of E. Bünning on the possible significance of thick epidermal walls in mature leaves, and phenolic pigments in rapidly growing pendent young leaves, in protection from u.v.-damage are surely worthy of mention. In the same chapter the fascinating work of O. Bjorkman and colleagues on the physiology and biochemistry of plants that live in perennial deep shade in the sub-tropical forests of southern Queensland is ignored. The suggestion on pp. 159-160 that a large proportion of the perennial species in arid and semi-arid regions is made up of succulents, C4 grasses, sclerophylls and switch plants, while 'many remaining perennials are more mesophytic species which avoid dry periods by leaf abscission, or as bulbs and tubers' is woefully misleading. All the semi-deserts of the world, except those in which succulents come to the fore, are dominated by soft-leaved shrubs, which admittedly lose some leaves in the dry season every year and a great many in exceptionally dry years, but which are normally decidedly leafy throughout the year. I mean, of course, such plants as A triplex and other Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia and other Compositae, and Larrea and other Zygophyllaceae. The authors fail utterly to say anything about the superb, refined research of O. L. Lange, O. Bjorkman, H. A. Mooney, M. M. Caldwell and colleagues in the last 15 years on the water and temperature relations of these plants in the field, and of their carbon balance. Equally bizarre is the failure to mention the poikilohydric vascular plants ('resurrection plants'), which have been shown by D. Gaff and others in the last decade to be more numerous and widespread than formerly supposed. As in many texts, the distinction made by H. Walter between semi-deserts with diffuse vegetation, and deserts with discontinuous vegetation, is not made. The difference between an extensive, continuous, relatively shallow-rooted community dependent on the directly intercepted rainfall on the one hand, and one composed of deep-rooted species that lives in wadis on water accumulated during flash floods on the other hand, is apparently not appreciated. A related lacuna is seen in the section entitled 'The supply of water by the soil' (pp. 127-33). No mention is made of the fact that the texture of the soil, through its impact on infiltration, is of overwhelming importance in determining the effective water supply in arid regions, so that sandy soils supply water more effectively than clay soils, much to the initial surprise of the European ecologists. It is perhaps significant that Walter's Die Vegetation der Erde in ökophysiologischer Betrachtung , which covers so many of these points very clearly, is not even cited. Teleology and anthropomorphism are encountered again and again throughout the book. We read of plants 'coping' (p. 24), 'maximizing' (p. 44), 'making no attempt' (p. 48), and of ' a mechanism for' (p. 54), 'similar ends' (p. 68), 'method employed' (p. 144) and 'tactics adopted' (p. 148). In some quarters it is fashionable to regard such use of teleology as harmless, but this book clearly illustrates the great danger of it, because it is the trivial manifestation of a fundamentally false approach to the natural world, in other words, a belief in optimization during evolution. On p. 53 we read that ' The relative constancy of LWR [leaf weight ratio] and plasticity of SLA [specific leaf area] imply that the plant has an optimum developmental pattern in terms of dry weight distribution Although the word optimum is not used in other places, the reader is left with the feeling that optimization is taken for granted. Thus, on p. 55, we read that 'one response open to a plant growing in shade is to increase the activity of the photosynthetic system. Accordingly, one can identify . . . '. On p. 115' Low-nutrient species opt therefore . . .'. On p. 1 64 we have ' Leaves designed . . .'. And so the book goes on. Now, all that the working</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 287 hypothesis of evolution by natural selection implies is that organisms which are more fit will tend to become more abundant, while those that are very unfit may become extinct. There is no reason whatever to think that any organism, plant, animal or microbe, has ever been 'optimized'. In any case, what could optimization mean? To cover the whole of the habitable earth with one species for ever? Or merely to be the most abundant species in a community, or the most widespread, or the longest-lasting in evolutionary time? By these criteria, there is plenty of evidence that some plants have been more nearly optimized than others. Why should all the characteristics of present-day plants represent the best solution to some problem, as it is conceived by man? This issue is closely related to that of the control of the abundance of one species relative to that of another, which the authors never face up to. In neither the Introduction nor the chapter on Interactions between organisms is there adequate discussion of the whole life-cycle of the seed plant, or of the importance of compensating advantages at different stages of the life-cycle in species that persist in mixture. This lack of background is felt most keenly in the discussion of such topics as the relative abundance of C3 and C4 species, and of plants with and without mycorrhizas or nitrogen-fixing nodules. I can mention only a few of the particularly disappointing features in Chapters 1 , 2 and 4. In Chapter 1 there is no mention of succession. Even if we do not believe all the generalizations being bandied about at present concerning the physiological features of early- and late-successional species, this dimension is surely so important that it merits a place in the 'ecological and evolutionary framework in which plants operate'. In Chapter 2 some of the problems arise from basing the chapter on light as the resource instead of carbon dioxide. For example, the issue of leaf inclination and orientation, if it is to be handled satisfactorily, must be considered in the context of heat balance and water balance just as much as in the context of the interception of radiation which is to be used in photosynthesis. Only then can the interactions of these factors in determining the rate of carbon assimilation be worked out. In yet other cases familiar erroneous statements are repeated. On p. 1 38 we meet another restatement of the catenary analysis of water moving along the soil-plant-air continuum in response to differences in water potential. Is it not time that students were told the following facts? (i) The rate of diffusion of water from the leaf to the atmosphere is proportional to the vapour pressure difference, which is not linearly related to water potential, (ii) Movement through any pore in the apoplast of radius down to about 10"9 m responds only to the hydrostatic pressure potential (and so a cut shoot will suck up a solution of syrup if it is not too viscous), (iii) Although the direction of movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane is governed by the overall water potential, there is no reason to believe that the rate of movement will be proportional to the difference in water potential because the latter is a thermodynamic property, on the basis of which we should expect only to say whether or not something is likely to happen. Unfortunately the book is riddled with minor sources of annoyance, of which a few are listed here. On p. 74 Bromus rigidus , Er odium bo try s , Trifolium subterraneum and Vulpia my uros are referred to as 'Australian'. Why not Californian? They have become widespread on farmed land in both these regions, having been introduced by man from the Eurasian and North African Mediterranean area. In Fig 3.10 rates of uptake of phosphorus and potassium are plotted against 'Root density (m/tray)'. How can one compare these results with those of others? (Reference to the original paper in Plant and Soil does not help, as no tray-size is specified.) In Figs 1 .2 and 2.7 rates of photosynthesis are plotted against 'Light intensity' in foot-candles, where it would have been easy to find more modern work in which radiant flux density was recorded in more useful units. In Table 4.6 the diameters of the vessels [mc] of four conifers are listed! On p. 160 the authors use 'mesophytic' for mesomorphic, and on p. 148 'xerophytic' for xeromorphic. Time and again terms are introduced without definition, e.g. 'phenology' (pp. 15 and 24),</page><page sequence="4">288 Book Reviews 'r-selecteď (p. 23), 'leaf angle' (pp. 37, 65 and 159), 'irradiance' (p. 47), 'évapotrans- piration' (p. 128) and 'alvar' (p. 155). In conclusion, it must be said that this book represents an opportunity missed. We still need a reasonably priced book which shows how ' intricate physiological mechan- isms. . .really operate under field conditions'. P. J. Grubb</page></plain_text>
