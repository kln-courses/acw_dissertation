<plain_text><page sequence="1">304 REVIEWS Experience and Interpretation. The Gifford Lectures 1952, Second Series. By C. E. Raven. Pp. viii+228. Cambridge University Press, 1953. 2iJ. Dr. Raven, invited to deliver the Gifford Lectures at Edinburgh in 1951 and 1952, chose for his subject Natural Religion and Christian Theology. The first series, that for 1951, has already been published with the title Science and Religion and was reviewed in the last number of this Journal. We have here to call attention to the second, delivered in 1952, and dealing with Experience and Interpretation. It is a commonplace of such discussions that the world-view which came during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to replace that which in the Middle Ages had been taken for granted, the world-view which is now the common inheritance of all educated men, presents a special difficulty to Christian theologians, whose religion centres in the belief in certain historical events, said to have occurred in the first century of our era, and recorded by men who were strangers to our world-view and whose language assumed one which for us has become impossible. The first series of Dr. Raven's Gifford Lectures was devoted to a most interesting account of the great scientific movement to which is due the change in perspective consequent upon the replacement of one picture of the universe by another, inconsistent and incompatible with that which it has replaced, and which was presupposed by the writers of the sacred books of Christianity. It is Dr. Raven's opinion that a 'new Reformation' has become neces sary, and is indeed in process of accomplishment, whereby Christian theology, which the Reformers of the sixteenth century endeavoured to adjust to the 'humanism' induced by the rediscovery of classical anti quity, may be adjusted to the results of the scientific investigation of nature which has been going on during the last 400 years. Dr. Raven is in both series of his Gifford Lectures concerned to show that the history of this scientific movement has in at least one important respect been very generally misrepresented; and also to call in question the sharp contrast sometimes drawn between Natural Science as inter ested only in 'universale' and History as interested in particular indi viduals and unique events. To quote from the first series (Science and Religion, p. 7) : 'To represent the history of science, as is done in almost all the text-books, as a papal succession, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton, with Boyle and Hooke and a few others wedged into the series, is only possible on the assumption that the important contributions are those which led up to the dominant mechanism and determinism of the late nineteenth century, and that the astonishing achievements of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 305 zoologists and botanists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries can be ignored.' It is well known that Dr. Raven's own special studies, which have resulted in his books on English Naturalists from Neckam to Ray and on the Life and Works of the last-named naturalist, have been devoted to the 'anatomists and herbalists, the gardeners and explorers' whose claim to rank with the astronomers in the importance of their contribution to science is too often overlooked. While it is no doubt true that, in the main, modern natural science, while based on observa tion of and experiment upon individual bodies, aims at the establishment of general laws, whereof the behaviour of such bodies are no more than instances, yet, when they are living bodies, their individuality becomes increasingly relevant—'my dog Tony, your dog Bess', as Dr. Raven says (jExperience and Interpretation, p. 12). After all, the astronomers them selves cannot ignore the fact that the heavenly bodies which they study are those which they find to be there; their number and properties are not demonstrable a priori ; however regular and predictable their motions, their actual 'collocation', as Mill called it, remains an historical or, if you like it, a brute fact, beyond which we cannot go. Thus, though there remains an important contrast between 'universale' which are, as Aristotle said, the business of Science, and the individuality, regard to which is the hall-mark of History, Dr. Raven does well to remind us that the world is of one texture throughout; that the things which the man of science observes and on which he experiments are always themselves particular individuals, while, on the other hand, the study of them must always result in the establishment of generalizations. It is, I think, no mere accident that it is just with the study of the plants and animals in which Dr. Raven himself is specially interested that the importance of individual differences becomes ever greater as we approach the human ity which is 'the roof and crown of' earthly 'things' that it is the custom of our language to associate with the phrase 'Natural History'. Dr. Raven is surely right in saying that religion has no interest in the restriction of religious experience to our own species. It is another question whether we always sufficiently realize that we have in no other species any indication of that perception of an absolute distinction between what is true and what is not, which I take to have been in Aristotle's mind when he dwelt upon the divinity of voOs, which comes as it were 'from without', in language to which (in consequence of its association in his mind with a purely fanciful theory about the constitution of the heavenly bodies, to which modern science lends no support whatever) sufficient attention has perhaps not always been paid. While the first series of Dr. Raven's Gifford Lectures was more directly concerned with the scientific revolution which in his view makes 621. 2 X</page><page sequence="3">306 reviews a 'New Reformation' an urgent necessity, the subject of his second series is the 'religious experience' which he holds—and surely rightly holds—to be as real and as important as ever, despite the immense enlargement and improvement during the last three centuries of our experience of the world in which our lot is cast; and the interpreta tion of that religious experience by a theology which will take into account the fuller knowledge of our environment and of our own nature by which it is now confronted. In inviting the present writer to review Dr. Raven's account of this the Editors have put the duty of estimating its importance into the hands of a survivor of an earlier generation, to whom the work of some whose names are now household words among students of theology is unfamiliar, and who inevitably occupies a stand point which to younger men may well seem so antiquated as to be irrelevant. On nothing, I think, is Dr. Raven more concerned to insist than on suffering as perhaps inseparable from love (p. 117)—since love involves sympathy, and, at least to that extent, suffering (p. 119), and as therefore 'an eternal element in the nature of God' (p. 214). Suffering, in this sense, is not equivalent to pain, although at the human level and in our imperfect and sinful world it usually includes it. Dr. Raven nowhere refers to the remarkable essay by Friedrich von Hugel on Suffering and God (in the second—posthumously published—volume of his Essays and Addresses). There is perhaps less diametrical opposition between his view and the Baron's than might at first sight seem to be the case. For, in accordance with etymology, Dr. Raven holds that 'suffering' is involved in sympathy or compassion; and, attributing these to God, he attributes suffering also to him. Von Hiigel, on the other hand, agrees with him in attributing sympathy and compassion to God, though not suffering. To such attempts to enter into these 'deep things of God' our language is inevitably inadequate. Within the limits of this review it is impossible to do more than to suggest lines of thought which our readers may care to follow up. Dr. Raven is prepared to accept the traditional view that Patripassianism is a heresy, for, while he would say that God—and not only the humanity of the incarnate Son—suffered on the cross, he would not regard the suffering of God as pain. On the other hand, the Good Friday experience of his own with the narrative of which Von Hiigel concludes his essay, might be accepted by Dr. Raven as conceding what he most desires to maintain. Before leaving this subject, I should like to call attention to what appear to me to be the profoundly suggestive implications of the great German mystic Jakob Boehme's teaching that the dark principle in nature is as it were the fuel which eternally feeds the eternal love and joy which constitute the life of God.</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 307 The Christology of Dr. Raven I cannot deny that I have found diffi cult. He is surely right in concentrating his attention upon the Christian experience which for nearly 2,000 years has attested the power of the personality presented by the New Testament as that of 'the Lord Jesus Christ' to create in those who accept its appeal the assurance that they are saved from their sins and reconciled to God. No account of the origin of Christianity which fails to account for this experience can be satisfactory. Yet the traditional account presents to a generation accus tomed to the standards of modern critical history problems of which Dr. Raven is, of course, well aware, but of which he perhaps hardly sufficiently emphasizes the urgency. Two of these seem to me to demand a fuller treatment than they here receive. The first is that of the relation of the picture of the Lord in the fourth gospel to that in the Synoptic accounts. No doubt this problem must nowadays be otherwise stated than it often was half a century ago. No record which we have is antecedent to the existence of a community which already worshipped Jesus as Lord and Son of God. In the Synoptic gospels as well as in the fourth we have 'interpretation' as well as 'experience'. Nor, on the other hand, have we any real knowledge of a Christianity whose Christ has not already undergone the Johannine interpretation. Yet there is a real difference between the Johannine and the Synoptic pictures of him which continues to baffle the efforts of theologians to produce a syn thesis satisfactory to their readers. The other problem which seems to me to demand more attention than it receives in Dr. Raven's Christo logical chapters is that of the human nature of the risen and glorified Christ and of the continuity of its experience with that of the life 'after the flesh' in Nazareth and Jerusalem. In conclusion, I may perhaps be allowed to touch on a subject on which Dr. Raven has done me the honour of referring to my own remarks. On p. 146 he discriminates the affirmation of 'three modes of being' in the Godhead from the 'orthodox' doctrine of the Trinity, but decides that they differ rather in language than in meaning, the word 'person' as applied to Father, Son, and Spirit being used in a sense quite different from that which it suggests to a modern Englishman, but which (he thinks) is not necessarily implied by the original Greek word ΰπόστασις. Following up this comment, he recognizes in an appended note (p. 219) the existence of two types of Christian experience to which the two ways of speaking correspond ; that of 'those whose religion centres in thought and devotion upon Christ' and 'those whose worship is primarily directed to God, God as revealed in and interpreted by Christ, God who is active in the incarnate Word and the indwelling Spirit, but who is essentially one'. I gather that he infers from my treatment of the doctrine</page><page sequence="5">3o8 reviews of the Trinity in my Gifford Lectures that I belong to the former type. Here, however, he is mistaken. I am of those whose habit is to address my prayers to God rather than to Christ; a habit which is, I like to think, authorized by the Lord's Prayer and by the tradition that the Eucharist is offered to the Father, so that prayers to Christ in public worship have always been rather occasional interjections than of the substance of the liturgy. But I have also been accustomed to hold it as a remarkable evidence of Christianity that (if I may quote words of my own in the current number of this Journal) 'a trinitarian theory which was directly determined not by philosophical considerations, but by the exigencies of a religious tradition resting on what professed to be an inspired record of actual facts should have been found to be a more adequate account of what ultimate reality might be thought to be than any which had been evolved by independent speculation'. What Dr. Raven considers to be a dangerously anthropomorphic doctrine of the divine nature commended itself to me not as a consequence of what has been called 'Christocentricity' in my religion but as metaphysically more acceptable, independently of the belief in the Incarnation in Jesus Christ; though, doubtless, apart from that belief trinitarian theology would have remained a philosophical speculation and not the formula tion of a religious experience possible to men of every grade of culture and of 'every nation and kindred and tongue and people'.
