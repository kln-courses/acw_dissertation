The deep-seated, blind, and intricate forces that shape cul- ture, also mold the so-called creative leaders of society as essentially as they mold the mass of humanity. Progress, so far as it can objectively be considered to be such, is something that makes itself. We do not make it,"-A. L. Kroeber.* I Every living organism is confronted by a world external to itself. This external world is in a very real sense alien to the organism and is often inimical to it. One must come to terms with one's environment, however, in order to live, to survive. To adjust to environment is to control it to a degree, at least from the standpoint of the organ- ism; adjustment is never wholly passive. Success in adjustment means survival, and survival means mastery, mastery of organism over external world. It is but a step from this position to the belief, in the human species, that the external world and the events that take place there are but the realiza- tion of ideas and emotions projected from the mind of God or of man. The ideas come first, they are the original seeds, the prime movers. As they are thrust forth from the mind they take form as stars and planets, animals and plants, tools and edifices, * Anthropology, p. 133 (New York, 1923). rituals and institutions. In the beginning was the Idea. And the Idea finds expression in the Word, and the Word becomes not only flesh (John I, 14), but earth and sky and all creation. Let there be Light and there was light. The external world is but a projection of the mind of God. This view of the coslnos and reality is world- wide. In Egypt we find it expressed in the con- ception of the god Ptah. In his early days Ptah was the patron of architects and craftsmen. But eventually he became the supreme mind from which all things were derived: " The world and all that is in it existed as thought in his mind; and his thoughts, like his plans for buildings and works of art, needed but to be expressed in spoken words to take concrete form as material realities." 1 As it is with gods, so it is with men, according to the neuro-symbolic tropism of the race called folk-thought. As the gods create and move their worlds with thought and words, so do men shape theirs. With incantation and ritual, with verbal formula and acts, and sometimes merely by the concentration of mind and will, they can make the rain to fall, change the course of the sun in the heavens, heal the sick, smite their enemies, cause crops to grow, regulate their mode of life and, at 1 James H.

We shall take note of their work later. Social science is frequently absolved from its sins of sterility and impotence by sympathetic friends who point out that the scientist in the social field does not have laboratories at his com- mand like the physicist and hence cannot be expected to produce theories that can withstand the tests these techniques can administer. But this exoneration is fallacious and misleading. It is true of course that the social scientist does not have laboratories-like the physicist. But he does have laboratories in another, and in a very real, sense. History and ethnography provide the social scientist with the equivalent of the laboratories of the physicist. How does the human organism respond to polyandry, to mothers-in-law, mone.v, spectroscopes, holy water, governmental regulation of prices; how will men live in desert tundra, or jungle; what will be the effect of technological advance on social life and philosophy? Answers to these and thousands of similar questions may be obtained by studies of the infinitelv varied circumstances and conditions under which man has lived on this planet during the last million years. If the social scientist could set up his experiments as the physicist or rat psychologist does, it would be difficult to imagine a requirement that has not been met by some tribe, some culture, at some time and place. The meager yield of social science is not due to lack of laboratories but rather from not knowing how to use the resources at its disposal. Ancient Egypt is an excellent laboratory in which the social scientist can test many theories. It was quite isolated, being cut of35 from its neighbors by deserts, mountains, and the sea. It was therefore relatively undisturbed by outside influence. We have a fairly good record, both archeologic and documentary, of history and cul- tural development of Egypt for tens of centuries. The land was richly endowed as contrasted, let us say, with Australia and so we can observe the growth of culture from a fairly primitive level to one of the greatest civilizations of the ancient world. IIere we have laid out before us, on a stage of adequate size and against a background of millenia, a culture process at work. We can take note of the materials employed, the resources both natural and cultural. We can follow the changes one by one. We can trace the development step last, find their way safely to the Land of the Dead. But it is not only the external world, the world of nature, that falls thus under man's control. IIis own world, his society, his culture, and his history are even more subject to his will, for are they not obviously made by him, and is it not plain that they are merely the expressions of his thought and wish? So runs the tropism of folk-thought. But all men are not equal, even on the level of primitive society. Some are better shamans than others; they have more c; power." On higher cul- tural levels we find chiefs and priests; then kings and emperors, popes and potentates. The god Ptah in the persons ot artists, scientists, lawgivers, rulers, generals, prophets, and inventors spews out new tools and devices, new codes and institutions, new ways of life. Cultural advance is but the worlt of a relatively few gifted individuals. And as culture advances, the exceptional person increases in stature; great cultures can be built only by Great Men. Like Yahweh who made the light merely by calling for it, the Great Men make society and history by exercising their inherent genius. Thus the verbal tropism. II In Egypt in the fourteenth century before the Christian era some remarkable events took place. Monotheism came to the fore and waged war on the old polytheism. All gods were abolished save one, and he was made Lord of all. Temples were closed, their priests driven out, their lands and revenues confiscated. A new capital was built. The government was reorganized. A marked change in art occurred. The whole regime of Egypt changed its aspect, and, it has been claimed, the events which took place then have profoundly affected our lives today. IIow did all this come about ? What caused this upheaval that shook Egypt to its foundations and extended its influ- ence even to us today? One of the answers has been: Ikhnaton. This genius, through his vision and insight, caught a glimpse of a new philosophy and a new way of life, and through sheer will and determination transformed the nation at his feet. At least, so we have been told. Needless to say, not all students of Egyptian history have relied upon so simple an explanation.

We can see how one factor influenced others. We can count and evaluate. In short, we can do about all that a physical scientist can do in his laboratory cxcept repeat the experiment. We have, then, in Egypt a proving ground in which to test many theories of social science. We may distinguish two main types of historical interpretation: the 7)sychological and the cultur- ological.2 Especially prominent in the psycho- logical interpretation is the explanation of historic events in terms of the personalities of outstanding individuals, but it resorts also to the "tempera- ments " of peoples or races, and even to such thinC,s as " the spirit of the times." The cultur- ological type of interpretation explains history in terms of cultural forces and processes, in terms of the behavior, not of the human psyche, but of technologies, institutions, and philosophies. Let us then go to our laboratory and use it to evaluate the theories which undertake to explain the great philosophic and political events that took place during the life of Ikhnaton. NVe shall examine first the psychological interpretation. III The great religious and political revolution which gripped Egypt about 1380 B. C. has been pictured as the work of one man: Ikhnaton. " Until Ikhnaton," says Breasted,3 " the history of the world had been but the irresistible drift of tradition. All men had been but drops of water in the great current. IkJtnaton was the frst indi- vidual in history." And, says Breasted, Ikhnaton accomplished this revolution by imposing his own ideas, ideas born in his own mind, upon the external world: " Consciously and deliberately, by tntellectual process he gained his position, and then placed himself squarely in the face of tradi- tion and swept it aside " (emphasis ours). But ideas alone were not enough; will power 2 We use the term culturology to designate the science of culture, of civilization with its institutions, tech- nologies and philosophies. If a science of mammals is mammalogy and the scientific study of society is soci- ology, the science of culture may properly be called culturology. For a discussion of the origin and growth of this science, see the writer's essay, " The Expansion of the Scope of Science," ( Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences, Vol. 37, pp. 181-210, June 15 1947 ) . 3 The Development of Relipion and Thought in Ancient Egypt, p. 339 (New York, 1912). and energy were required too. Ikhnaton possessed these qualities also, we are told. " He possessed unlimited personal force of character." 4 He " was fully convinced that he might entirely recast the world of religion, thought, art, and life by the invincible purpose he held....5 Everything bears the stamp of his individuality. The men about him must have been irresistibly swayed by his unbending will....6 The court officials blindly followed their young king, and to every word which he spoke they listened attentively." 7 . R. Hall interprets Egyptian historx in terms of the waxing and waning of intelligence which reached its "acme under the supremely intelligent " Ikhnaton.8 " IIis reign was the earliest age of the rule of ideas, irrespective of the condition and willingness of the people " (Breasted 9). The revolution of Ikhnaton "can only be ascribed to the individual genius of a very exceptional man " (Gardiner 10). Alexandre Moret asserts that " Amenophis IV [Ikhnaton] was the man who turned aside the natural course of events." 11 To E. A. Wallis Budge 12 Ikhnaton was "a religious fanatic, intolerant, arrogant and obsti- nate, but earnest and sincere." No one, he says, " but a half-insane man would have been so blind to facts as to attempt to overthrow Amen and his worship." James Baikie 13 saw him as a man with a "remorselessly clear mind," but exceedingly intolerant. " Seeing clearly," he writes, "that the universality of his god meant monotheism, he saw also that with his rigid devotion to truth there could be no room for tolerance of the easy- going old cults of the other gods." In short, the great upheaval in Egypt was brought about by a 4 Breasted, A History of Egypt, p. 362. 6 Breasted, The Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt, p. 342. oBreasted, "Ikhnaton," Vol. 12, p. 78 (Encyclopedia Britannica, 14th ed.). 7 Arthur Weigall, The Life and Times of Akhnaton, p. 68 (London, 1923 printing). s " Egypt, Religion," in Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. 8, p. 58 (14th ed.). 9 The Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt, p. 342. l°Alan H.

Geo. Steindorf35 and 1i. C. Seele 14 regard Ikhnaton as " probably the most fascinating personality who ever sat on the throne of the pharaohs." He had a " mystical temperament " and " an extraordinary single-minded character." When once " embarked on a purpose he held to it with tenacity and carried it through unwaveringly with nothing short of fanaticism." J. D. S. Pendlebury 15 who rejects Breasted's view that Ikhnaton was " the first individual in history," regards him, neverthe- less, as an "extraordinary character," the "iirst rebel . . . whom we know, the first man with ideas of his own . . ." (emphasis ours). Ikhnaton revolutionized not only theology but art as well, we are told. The new era in painting and sculpture that is associated with his reign was initiated and directed by Ikhnaton himself: " It is evident that the artists of Ikhnaton's court were taught by him to make the chisel and the brush tell the story of what they actually saw." 16 Breasted believes that the remarkable hymn to Aton " was probably written by the king him- self." 17 So remarkable a person does Ikhnaton appeal to some observers that they cannot believe him to be a normal man. " Ikhnaton pursued his aims with [such] fatuous blindness and feverish fanati- cism " that Breasted feels that ;' there is something hectic and abnormal in this extraordinary man, suggesting a mind which may even have been diseased." 18 Weigall believes that Ikhnaton was an epileptic, subject to hallucinations.19 There is of course some evidence to support the theory that Ikhnaton was abnormal. In the art of the day, which is said to be characterized by naturalism and realism, he is not infrequentlfr depicted as misshapen and abnormal. " The S:ing preaches the return to nature, makes the artist work from the living model, and allows a plaster cast of his face to be taken (specimens have been found), to make sure that his features are correctly reproduced.... The sculptors faith- fully reproduce the promitlent lower jaw and the 14 When Egypt Buled the East, pp. 2()1, 80 (Chicago, 1942) . 15 Tell el-Amarna, p. xiv (London, 1935). 6 Breasted, " Ikhnaton," p. 79. 7Ibtd., p. 78. 18 Ibtd., p. 80. 19 The Ltfe and Times of Ak7?naton, pp. 46, 51, 91. long, bulging skull, even when these deformities have been further aggravated by disease." 20 In his later years, Ikhnaton is depicted, ac- cording to Moret, as "rounded and effeminate- a hermaphrodite figure, with prominent breasts, wide hips, and thighs too much curved, which makes one suspect a morbid nature, with some pathological flaw." 21 Some writers have attempted to account for the remarkable and unusual character of Ikhnaton in terms of race as well as of psychology, they have maintained that he was not a full-blooded Egyp- tian. Thus, Weigall reminds us that "it must always be remembered that the king had much foreign blood in his lTeins." This helped him to stand out amongst the "superstitious Egyptians [who were] ever lacking in originality." 29 Moret, too, comments on "the mixture of Aryan blood . . . further complicated by the Syrian descent of Tii 2 23 in Ikhnaton's racial background. Here, then, we have an explanation of Egyptian history for this period. A phenomenal person appears on the scene, a man with so much genius and power of will as to go beyond the boundaries of the normal, and by himself to transform the religion, social organization, and the art of a great nation. Here we have a theory to be tested in our ;' laboratory." IV Before turning to our laboratory proper, namely, the culture history of Egypt as we know it through archeological research and documentary studies, let us consider briefly what we know about the evolution of culture in general and the nature o-f societies like that of ancient Egypt in particular. Man began his career as an anthropoid who was just learning to talk. He was distinguished from all other animal species by the faculty of articulate speech.24 It was this faculty which transformed 20 A.

And, finally, language and speech made it possible for man to accumulate experience and knowledge in a form that made easy transmission and maximum use possible. It was the ability to use symbols{)f which articulate speech is the most important and charac- teristic form of expression that made the origin and subsequent growth of culture possible. But symbols did not provide the motive power for cultural advance. This could only come from energy, energy in the sense in which the physicist uses this term. All life is a matter of energy transformations. Organisms enable themselves to live by capturing free energy from non-living systems and by incorporating it into their own living systems. Culture is man's peculiar means of harnessing energy and of putting it to work in order to make human life secure. Culture grows and develops as ways of harnessing more energfi per capita per year are found and as the means of making the expenditure of this energy more effective are improved. Animal husbandry, agri- culture, water power, and the use of fuels in engines, together with countless inventions and improvenlents of tools and mechanical devicebs mark the growth of culture as it is carried forward by technological advance.26 The evolution of society is marked by two great stages: primitive or tribal, and civil or national. The tribe and clan are characteristics of primitive society (although the clan is by no means uni- versal); the political state characterizes civit society. Primitive society is based upon kinship ties; civil society upon property relationships and territorial distinctions. Primitive soeiety was relatively homogeneous structurally; civil society, more diversified.27 25 Cf. Leslie A. White, "On the Use of Tools by Primates," ( Journal of Comparative Psychology, Tol. 34, pp. 369-374, 1942). 26 Cf. Leslie A. White, " Energy and the Evolution of Culture," ( American Anthropologist, Vol. 45, pp. 335- 356, 1943). 27 See Lewis H. Morgan, Anctent Soctety, p. 6 (New 4 The transition from primitive to civil society was brought about by technological advance, specifically, by the development of agriculture, supplemented though not everywhere by the domestication of animals. The maturation of the agricultural arts produced the following chain of sequences: increased food supply, increase in population, increase in population density and in size of political groupings, diversion of human labor from food-producing to specialized arts and crafts, a new type of exchange and distribution of goods, money and markets, economic classes, and so on. The differentiation of structure, the specializa- tion of function, of civil society required a special mechanism to co-ordillate the various segments and classes of society and to integrate them into a coherent and effective whole. Such an integrative mechanism was produced. It was the " State- Church," i. e., a mechanism having temporal and ecclesiastical aspects. The function of the state-church is to preserve the integrity of society against dissolution from within and against destruction from outside forces. In other words, this integrative mechanism must co-ordinate the various elements of society{)ccu- pational groups, social strata and classes and relate them to one anothela harmoniously, on the one hand; and on the other, the life of the society must be made secure against the aggression of its neighbors. This integrative mechanism has a variety of forms. Church and state, priest and king, may be distinct or they may be one, struc- turally. And, of course, there are many degrees of overlapping or distinction. But everywhere in civil society whether it be among the Maya or Inca of the New World, or in AIesopotamia, India, or China in the Old we find this fundamental mechanism of co-ordination, integration, and regu- lation. And it always presents these two aspects: temporal and ecclesiastical. Thus we find it in ancient Egypt. But one further observation before we turn to the culture history of Egypt itself: In civil societies York, 1877) for the classic statement of this thesis. Of this distinction A. R. Radeliffe-Brown writes: " Indeed we may agree with Morgan that the passage from lower forms of civilization to higher forms such as our own was essentially a passage from society based on kinship to the state based on political organization," pp. 40-41, " Some Problems of Bantu Sociology," (Bantu Studies, October, 1922).</page><page sequence="6">96 WEITE: IkEnaton: The Great Man vs. The Culture Process where the temporal and ecclesiastical aspects of the integratlve mecharlism are structurally distinct there is always riaralry, a rivalry which not infre- quently becomes a bitter struggle for power. This is not surprising, of course. Both church and state are engaged in the same tasks, both have they same function so far as the social organism is con- cerned, namely, integration, co-ordinatiorl, regu- lation. As Franklin D. Roosevelt once shrewdly observed: "That human agency which we call government is seeking through social and economic means the same goal which the churches are seeking through social and spiritual means." 28 The basis for rivalry is therefore plain. Each has its own "vested interest2n; each tries to increase its power. The result is often a bitter struggle. We think ofRhand of the contest between :Senry VIII of England alld the Roman Church, and of the Church ts. State struggle throughout many centuries of European history.29 We recall Thomas Jefferson'Ks diatribes against the priests and churches and the efforts7 not only to separate Church from State in America, but to render the former powerless. We recall that Pius IX in his so-called Syllabus of Errors " claimed the complete independence of the Church from state control; upheld the necessity of a continuance of the tem- poral power of the Roman see." 30 The position of the Roman Church on this issue has been well set for1;h by Reverend II. Earrington as follows: 31 ;' Christendom is one society, and in that society the spiritual authority is paramount because of its greater dignittr, and the far greater importance of its work. In any difficulties between spiritual and temporal rulers the spiritual must be the judges, for without treason to Christ they may not permit anything earthly however important tc3 interfeae with the work of salvation. If therefore the rulers of the church, even mistakenly, judge that this work is hampered by some temporal policy, loyal Christians must abide by the decision." There are numerous examples of political action 28 Radio Address to the Federal Council cxf Churches, December 6, 1933. 29 Cf. C. J. H.

To mentlon but a few: Innocent III an- nulled the Magna Charta; Innocent X pronounced the Treaty of Westphalia null and void; Pius IX condemned the Austrian constitution of 1868; until 1904, Catholics in Italy were prohibited by the Church from taking part in any parliamentary electiorl. In Mexico in recent years we have witnessed a bitter struggle between church and state. The issue has, of course, been couched in religious terms. But everyone who understands the situa- tion knows that it is a question of who is to rule Mexico, the ultramontane clerical politicians or the temporaln national political machine. Finally, we may note the case of Russia. Under the Czars church and state worked hand in hand. The church held vast estates and other properties and received a grant of millions of rubles from the state treasury every year. When the Bolsheviks came to power they at once stripped the church of its political functions. It is significant to note that not until this was done was there any great outcry against " religious persecution '2 in Russia. Under the Czars religious freedom hardly existed. There were periodic pogroms in which thousands of persons of an alien faith were done to death. Under the Soviets there was more religious free- dom - freedom for all faiths, freedom to believe and to worship as one pleased -than there ever had been under the old regime. Why then the great outcry from the clergy Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish alike? The answer is plain: the political functions of the church had been done away with and their sources of income virtually shut ofE.32 The Bolsheviki had tried to abolish the ecclesias- tical arm of the integrative mechanism of the new society. It is interesting to note, however, that the Church has been brought back to Russia in recent years and established once again as an integrative mechanism. The church today is " the most powerful unifying thing in Soviet civil life,' the BIetropolitan Benjamin, titular head of the Russian Orthodox church in America, said recently while on his way to ZIoscow.33 It is interesting S2During a tour of Soviet Russia in 1929, I visited open churches of many faiths.

V Let us turn now to the culture history of Egypt and trace the relationship between Church and State, priest and king, through the centuries. In the Old Kingdom (2800-2250 B. C.) we find the state, the Pharaoh, playing the leading role. To quote Breasted:34 ". . . there arose at the beginning of the nation's history a state form of religion, in which the Pharaoh played the supreme role. In theory, therefore, it was he alone who worshipped the gods; in fact, however, he was of necessity repre- sented in each of the many temples of the land by a high priest." The various temples and their respective priest- hoods were supported by the produce from their endowments in land and by contributions from the royal revenues. It was the business of the priests, in addition to their religious and ceremonial duties, to administer these lands and to collect revenue from them upon which they lived. A few centuries later, during the Middle King- dom, or the Feudal Age, we find that although the temples had increased somewhat in size, " the official cult was not materially altered, and there was still no large class of priests." 35 But the basis for a rise to power of the priest- hoods had long existed in their possession of lands which were under their control and whose produce was appropriated by them. In addition to this they received frequent contributions from the royal treasury. The temples were, of course, not subject to taxation. They were, therefore, in a favorable position to increase their wealth through accumu- lation and expansion, and to grow in political power as their wealth accumulated. Under the Empire, First Period (beginning with Ahmose I, who completed the expulsion of the Hyksos about IS46 B. C.), the priesthoods had grown to considerable power and affluence. Says Breasted: 36 S4 A History of Egypt, p. 62. 85 Ibtd., p. 171. Sfl Ibid., p. 247. " As a natural consequence of the great wealth of the temples under the Empire, the priesthood becomes a profession, no longer merely an inci- dental office held by a layman, as in the Old and Middle Kingdoms. As the priests increase in numbers they gain more and more political power; while the growing wealth of the temples demands for its proper administration a veritable army of temple officials of all sorts, who were unknown to the old days of simplicity." Not only were the temples becoming wealthier and the priesthoods more powerful, they were be- coming unified as well: "Heretofore the priests of the various sanc- tuaries had never been united by any official ties, but existed only in individual and entirely sepa- rated communities without interrelation. All these priestly bodies were now united in a great sacerdotal organization embracing the whole land. The head of the state temple at Thebes, the High Priest of Amon, was the supreme head of this greater body also and his power was thereby increased far beyond that of his older rivals . . ." 37 Thus we find the priesthoods becoming wealthy, powerful, and organized. They are approaching the time when they will be able to threaten the supremacy of the Pharaoh himself, as we shall see. We get some notion of the growing political power of the priesthoods from an incident that occurred during the feud of the Thutmosids. During the declining years of Thutmose I, one of his sons, born to the King by an obscure concubine, Thutmose III, was put upon the throne "by a highly dramatic coup d'etat" of the priests of Amon and in the temple of that god. In the struggles for the throne which followed, between Thutmose III and his half-brother Thutmose II, and between Thutmose III and his half-sister wife, IIatshepsut, the priests played an important part. Originally kept in the background by Thutmose III, Hatshepsut was eventually elevated to a posi- tion of supremacy by a group the most powerful member of which was Hapuseneb, who was both High Priest of Amon and vizier. " He thus united in his person all the power of the administrative government with that of the strong priestly party." 38 These events took place about a century beforo S7 Idem. 88 A History of Egypt, p. 272</page><page sequence="8">98 WHITE: IkEnaton: The Great Man vs. The: Culture Process the time of Ikhnaton. During the reign of Amen- hotep III, the father of Ikhnaton, one of the High Priests of Amon, Ptahmose by name, was also one of the two grand viziers of the kingdom. Another held the office of chief treasurer. During this reign also the priests of Amon acquired some, if not complete control over the gold produced in the Sudan.39 In the use of spells used in mortuary rites (hlke), the priests " were provided with a means of acquiring wealth and influence which they did not fail to utilize to the utmost." 40 Thus we observe the growing power of the priesthoods. They held the most important oEces in the realm next to that of the king himself. To have been chief treasurer of the kingdom must have placed great power in the hands of the IIigh Priests of Amon, a power that was augmented by control over the gold supply from the Sudanese mines. These priests could make and unmake kings. They had but one more step to take: to seize the throne for themselves. Breasted believes that Ikhnaton's father " had evidently made some attempt to shake ofE the priestly hand that lay so heavily on the sceptre, for he had succeeded Ptah- mose by a vizier who was not a IIigh Priest of Amon." 41 And Peet feels that "it is not impos- sible that the increased power of the priesthood . . . was a circumstance which precipitated, if it did not actually cause, the religious revolution of Ikhnaton." 42 It was upon this stage that Amen- hotep IV was thrust at birth. VI Amenhotep IV was born about 1409 B. C., the3 son of Amenhotep III and his Queen Tiy. Esti- mates of his age at the time he ascended the throne as coregent with his father vary from nine to twenty-four years.43 For the first years of his . 39 S. R. K.

" To all intents and pur- poses, Ti ruled Egypt for several years after her husband's death," according to Wallis Budge, " and the boy king did for a time at least what his mother told him." 44 Glanville also believes that " Tiy clearly controlled him to some extent until he left Thebes." 45 Although Amenhotep III did not die until about the tenth year of Ikhnaton's reign, he was in bad health during this period and seems to have had little to do with the govern- ment.46 The fact that his name was chiselled out of inscriptions in the sixth year of Ikhnaton's reign would seem to support this view. Very early in the reign of Amenhotep IV the worship of a supreme god, Aton, was inaugurated. Aton was none other than the old sun-god, Re, in a new role. Other gods were tolerated for a while, but with the growing resentment of the priest- hoods, particularly that of Amon, Amenhotep IV built a new city-capital, Akhetaton, for his god, changed his name to Ikhnaton,47 closed the temples of the other gods, dispossessed the priesthoods, con- fiscated their lands and revenues, and set to work to establish his new regime, both religious and political. All this had taken place by the sixth year of his reign. Ikhnaton's reign was full of troubles as may well be imagined. Not only did he have a bitter struggle with powerful priesthoods on his hands, but by closing the tem.ples he incurred the resent- ment and opposition of numerous other classes as well, such as tradesmen, artisans, actors, scribebs, and even shepherds and peasants, who had a vested occupational interest in the old order. To be sure, the IIeretic King had a group of loyal followers, whom he rewarded handsomely for their loyaltv and support. Occupied as he was with a revolu- tion at home, Ikhnaton had little or no time for af3 airs abroad. As a consequence, revolts flared 44 Tutankhamen, ilmenism, etc., p. 76. 46 " Amenophis and his Successors," p. 124, in (;reat Ones of Ancient Egypt, W. Brunton et al. 46 Cf.

Even Thebes became a prey to plundering bands. Thus ended the Eighteenth Dynasty. Out of this chaos and confusion law and order eventually emerged organized around a man who had been an important figure in Egyptian govern- ment for years. This man was Harmhab. He had been commander in chief of the army under Ikhna- ton and Tutankhamun, and as deputy of the king he had attained a position in the empire second only to the king himself. Despite this fact, how- ever, Harmhab was never converted to the Aton religion. IIe did not go to Akhetaten with his king but remained in Memphis where he had his residence. "He remained loyal to the old gods especially to the patron divinity of his native cit;sr and to Amun." 50 He was thus acceptable to the priests of Amon. With their backing and that of the army which was already under his control he ascended the throne. The ceremony of installation was in fact carried out by the priests of Amon themselves.51 Some writers assert that he legalized his new position by marrying the sister of Ne- fertiti, but Alexandet ScharfE says that it " is certain" that this was not the case, that this assumption was born of an error of translation.52 Having come into power with priestly backing it is not surprising to see Harmhab busying him- self with the restoration begun by Tutankhamun. As a matter of fact, as soon as his government was in working order he set about energetically to restore the temples and their priesthoods to their former condition of wealth and power: " IIe restored the temples from the pools of the Delta marshes to Nubia. He shaped all their images in number more than before, increasing the beauty in that which he made.... He raised up their temples; he fashioned a hundred images with all their bodies correct and with all splendid costly stones. He sought the precincts of the gods which were in the districts in this land; he fur- nished them as they had been since the time of the first beginning. He established for them daily of3 erings every day. All the vessels of their temples were wrought of silver and gold. He equipped them with priests and with ritual priests and with the choicest of the army.

In the twelfth year of his reign, Ikhnaton's mother, Tiy, who resided in Thebes, visited Akhetaten at which time she may have urged action against the revolting vassals and a moderation of policy at home, perhaps even a compromise with the priests of Aton. At any rate, we find Ikhnaton making a feeble gesture against the rebels abroad and initiating conciliatory measures at home. Smenk- hkare, the " beloved" of Ikhnaton and now co- regent with him, was sent to Thebes to ef3ect a reconciliation with the priests of Amon.48 But dissension now broke out in the king's own house- hold. Although Ikhnaton seems to have been willing to compromise, Nefertiti, his wife, was not. At any rate, she fell into disgrace, or was estranged from her husband, and retired with some powerful followers to the north end of the city where she built a palace for herself. The political structure was disintegrating at home and abroad. Ikhnaton died about 1369 B. C. at Akhetaten; Smenkhkare, the coregent, died at almost the same time in Thebes. Tutankhaten, a boy of nine, ascended the throne. By now the priestly party was growing rapidly in strength. The new king soon realized that he could stay on the throne only if he " came to terms with the supporters of the traditional faith," i. e., the priests. IIe was obliged to avbandon his capital at Akhetaten and move his court to Thebes. He was compelled to abandon the heresy of Ikhnaton and to " acknowl- edge himself officially as an adherent of . . . Amun." Accordingly, he changed his name to Tutankhamun, " Beautiful in Life is Amun." In a manifesto he tells of his devotion to " his father Amun " and of his benefactions to his priests. He " made monuments for all the gods, fashioning their statues of pure djarn-gold, restoring their sanctuaries . . . providing them with perpetual endowments, investing them with divine offerings for the daily service, and supplying their pro- visions on earth." The triumph of the priests was virtually complete.49 Tutenkhamon reigned but nine years and was followed by Eye, a member of Ikhnaton's court. He too lasted but a short time. Egypt was now in 48 Steindorff and Seele, When Egypt Ruled the East p. 221; Glanville, " Amenophis and his Successors in the XVIIIth Dynasty," pp. 134-36. 49 Steindorff and Seele, op. ctt., pp. 223-226.</page><page sequence="10">WEITE: IkEnaton: lXhe Great Man vs. The Culture Process loo to them lands and cattle, supplied with all equip- ment." 53 Harmhab attempted to obliterate all traces of the era of heresy. He had the names of Ikhnaton, Tutankhamun, and Eye hacked from the monu- ments and his own put in their place. He con- sidered himself the direct successor to Amenhotep III, as if Ikhnaton and his followers had never existed. At Thebes, Harmhab razed the temple of Aton and used the materials to enlarge the temple of Amon. Aton's temple at Akhetaton was likewise despoiled to obtain building nzaterials. Ikhnaton's "tomb was wrecked and its reliefs chiselled out; while the tombs of his nobles there were violated in the same way. Every effort was made to anni- hilate all trace of the reign of such a man; and when in legal procedure it was necessary to cite documents or enactments from his reign he was designated as 'that criminal of Akhetaton'." 54 The prosperity and power of the priesthoods under Harmhab is well illdicated by the words of Nefer- hotep, the priest of Amon: " How bountiful are the possessions of him who knows the gifts of that god (Amon), the king of gods. Wise is he who knows him, favoured is he who serves him, there is protection for him who follows him." 55 Neferhotep " was at the moment receixing the richest tokens of the king's favour." As Breasted observes, the triumph of Amon was now complete. VII We may now follow the course of the relation- ship between church and state in Egypt for a few more centuries. The Nineteenth Dynasty began with wars of reconquest in Asia, followed by campaigns in Israel and against the Libyans. With the death of Merenptah, son of Ramesses II the land fell again into virtual anarchy from which it emerged in 1200 B. C. under Sethnakt, founder of the Twentieth Dynasty. Sethnakt came to the throne backed by the priesthoods, " these wealthiest and most powerful communities in Egypt." Ramesses III, Sethnakt's successor, was completely in the grip of the priests. The temples, says Breasted, 53 Breasted, A History of Egypt, p. 401. 54 Ibid, p. 402. 55 Ibid-, p. 403. "were fast becoming a grave political and eco- nomic menace." But Ramesses could do naught else but pour the wealth of the royal house into the sacred coffers with the most lavish liberality.5¢ We get a fair notion of the wealth and power of the priesthoods of the time of Ramesses III (1198-1167 B. C.) from an inventory in the Papy- rus Harris which covers almost all of the temples of Egypt: ". . . they possessed over one hundred and seven thousand slaves; . . . in all likelihood one person in every fifty was a slave of some temple. The temples thus owned two percent of the population. In lands we find the sacred endowments amounting to nearly three quarters of a million acres, that is, nearly one seventh, or over fourteen and a half percent of the cultivable land of the country . . . They owned nearly a half million head of . . . cattle; their combined fleets numbered eighty eight vessels, some fifty three workshops and shipyards . . . while in Syria, Sush and Egypt they owned in all one hundred and sisty nine towns. When we remember that all this vast property in a land of less than ten thousand square miles and some five or sis million inhabitants was entirely exempt from taxation 57 it will be seen that the economic equilibrium of the state was endangered.'7 58 Among the priesthoods, that of the god of Amon stood out as by far the richest and most powerful of all. Their estates and revenues were second only to those of the king. ' The political powels wielded by a community of priests who controlled such vast wealth," says Breasted, " was from now on a force which no Pharaoh could ignore. With- out compromisillg with it and continually con- eiliating it, no Pharaoh could have ruled long.' 59 Sometlmes the royal treasury stood empty while the temples were loaded down with wealth. We read of workmen during the reign of Ramesses III starving as they labored on some public works until in desperation they gather before the oMce of their master demanding their rations of grain. " Thus while the poor in the employ of the state were starving at the door of an empty treasury, the 56 Ibid., p. 47S, 489, 490. 57 This may be an overstatement; see Wm. F. Edgerton ;' The Government and the Governed in the Egyptian Empire," JNES VI (1947), p. 157. 58 Breasted, A Efistory of Egypt, pp. 491-92. 59 Ibid., p. 494.</page><page sequence="11">WHITE: IkEnclton: The Greslt Man vs. The Culture Process 101 store-houses of the gods were groaning with plenty. 60 At the coronation of Ramesses IV, a " detailed list of all the benefactions conferred . . . [by Ramesses III] on each and every large and small temple of the land" was published. "In this manner the new king contrived to confirm the clergy in their holdings of property and to gain their influential good will for his own reign . . . As the authority of the state grew weaker . . . the power and prestige of Amun and his priesthood expanded proportionately. All important public and private afEairs were regulated and decided either by the priesthood or by an oracle which operated . . . in the imperial temple . . .nn 61 As Breasted puts it, "the state was rapidly moving toward a condition in which its chief function should be religious and sacerdotal, and the assump- tion of royal power by the High Priest of Amon but a very natural and easy transition." 62 It was not long until this transition did indeed take place. In the reign of Ramesses XI, a man named Hrihor was appointed high priest of Amon at :liarnak. Next he became viceroy of Nubia and commander in chief of the army. A little later he assumed the vizierate of Upper Egypt. He now "had united under his personal control all the highest spiritual, military, and civil functions of the state. It was but a single step more to put aside the impotent Ramesses XI and ascend the throne in his place. By this act of usurpation (1085 B. C.), the secular state of the pharaonic empire was ushered to its grave and an ecclesias- tical state was erected in its place, in which the chief god of Thebes exercised the authority through the medium of his priesthood." 63 The triumph of the priests was nomr complete.64 VIII No matter how individualistic Ikhnaton might have been, no matter how enormous his intellect and indomitable his will, he had his setting in a great nation, in a rich and mature culture, and we 6° Ibid., p. 496.

Edgerton alludes to a new and diSerent interpretation of Hrihor's role in this political drama (op.cit.,p.153). may assume that it affected his life as he is supposed to have so profoundly changed the world about him. Let us, therefore, turn to an examina- tion of the relationship between Ikhnaton and the culture history of Egypt. It is plain at the outset that the events which mark the reign of Ikhnaton are not novel by any means. Far from it, they are merely part of a process that had been going on for centuries before Ikhnaton was born, namely, the philosophic trend toward monotheism and the age-old rivalry between king and priest. This culture process receives more emphatic and dramatic expression during the lifetime of Ikhnaton, no doubt, but there is nothing original in it whatever. Religious philosophy in Egypt had been moving in the direction of monotheism for centuries before Ikhnaton was born. We find in religious phi- losophy a reflection of the real world; the theology o:E a people will echo a dominant note in their terrestrial mode of life. A pastoral culture may find its image in a Good Shepherd and his flock; an era of cathedral building sees God as a Great Architect; an age of commerce finds Him with a ledger, jotting down moral debits and credits; emphasis upon the profit system and the high- pressure salesmanship that is required to make it function, picture Jesus as a super-salesman; 65 and, in an age of science, God " is a god of law and order " ( Millikan 66), a Great Scientist moving about in his cosmic laboratory, his experiments to perform. . n ancient Egypt, theological thinking was, as Breasted has so well said, " brought into close and sensitive relationship with political conditions." 67 In the very early period, there were numerous deities, many of which were local gods, or patrons of little kingdoms. As the political unification of Egypt progressed, a few of the greater gods emerged as nattonal deities. As the nation became more and more integrated under the rule of a powerful single head, there was a tendency for one god to become supreme. The ascendancy of 65 Cf.

Other priest- hoods, " desirous of securing for their own, perhaps purely local deity, a share of the sun-god's glory, gradually discovered that their god was but a form and name of Re; and some of them went so far that their theologizing found practical expression in the god's name. Thus, for example, the priests of Sobk, a crocodile god, who had no connection with the sun-god in the beginning, now called him Sobk-Re. In like manner, Amon, hitherto an obscure local god of Thebes, who had attained some prominence by the political rise of the city, was from now on a solar god, and was commonly called by his priest Amon-Re. There were in this movement the beginnings of a ten- dency toward a pantheistic solar monotheism, which we shall yet trace to its remarkable culmination." 68 The concept of Maat was developed from the designation of personal qualities, or something practised by individuals, to something of national dimensions a " spirit and method of a national guidance and control of human afEairs . . . suffused with moral conviction. There was thus created for the first time a realm of universal values, and in conceiving the divine ruler of such a realm the Egyptians were moving on the road towards monotheism." 69 But the conception of a supreme deity whose rule extended to the farthest reaches of the earth and embraced all lands and peoples was impossible so long as Egypt's power remained confined to the Wile valley. In the Pyramid Age the Sun-god ruled only Egypt, and in the hymns of the day we find him standing guard at her frontiers, "where he builds the gates which restrain all outsiders from entering his inviolable domain." 70 It is otherwise after Egypt's conquests abroad and the era of empire. Then the supreme god of Egypt became the Lord of the Universe. As Breasted has so succinctly put it: " Monotheism is but imperialism in religion." 71 Thus we see that for centuries on end before 68 Ibid., pp. 170-71. 69 Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience, p. 145 (New York, 1933 ) . 70 The Development of Relizgizorw and Thought in Ancient Egypt, p. 312. 71 Ibid-, pv 315. the reign of Ikhnaton, religious philosophy in Egypt had been developing in the direction of monotheism as the political unification and im- perial expansion of Egypt proceeded. And, as we have already seen, the rivalry between church and state, betmTeen priest and king, was already old before Amenhotep IX was born. What then did Ikhnaton originate ? The answer must be, " Virtually nothing." The trend toward monotheism was already there, and it was not until the latter years of his reign that Ikhnaton took the last logical step and attempted to abolish all other gods but Aton. As Breasted says, " this whole monotheistic movement is the culmination of the ancient recognition of a moral order by the Egyptian thinkers of the Pyramid Age and their creation of a realm of universal ethical values." 72 Aton, the Disk god, was of sufficient importance during the reign of Ikhnaton's father to have a temple erected in his honor at Thebes. Even " the full name of the new deity, ' Re-Eorus-of-the- Horizon who rejoices in his name of Shu who is the Disk ' is to be ascribed not to Akhenaten but to his father or even to some earlier king." 73 Indeed, the " most striking fact " pertaining to the various names of the new deity " is that they embody a distinct attempt at continuity with the sun worship of past ages." 74 The IIymn to Aton, which was composed by Ikhnaton himself, according to the belief of many authors (who, how- ever may know full well that the addresses of mod- ern heads of state are frequently written by others), was remarkable but unoriginal, according to Peet. Two architects of Amenhotep III, he writes, had already dedicated a hymn to the sun god which was " a very close anticipation of Ikhnaton's hymn to the disk 75 . . .; the ideas . . . [expressed in the latter] are not at all new, nor indeed are the phrases in which these ideas are embodied." 76 Nol' was Ikhnaton the first to erase the names of his rivals from public monuments; this was done freely in the feud of the Thutmosids. The struggle with the priesthoods was also acute when Ikhnaton ascended the throne. We have already seen that the priests of Amon held powerful offices under his father, Amenhotep III, 72 The Dawrw of Conscience, p. 296. 73 Peet, " Akhenaten, Ty, etc.," p. 93. 74Ibidv, pp. 96-97- 75 ;; Contemporary Life and Thought in Egypt," p. 205 76"Akhenaten, Ty, etc.," p. 102.</page><page sequence="13">WHITE: IkEncLton: The Great Man, vs. Thel C?llture Process 103 threatening the security of the throne. And Breasted says of them: They were rich and power- ful when Ikhnaton ascended the throne. " They had installed Thutmose III as king, and could they have supplanted with one of their own tools the young dreamer [Ikhnaton] who now held the throne they would of course have done so at the first opportunity." 77 Moret, too, sees the drastic steps taken by Ikhnaton as an attempt to " break the power of the priests of Amon lest they should dethrone the kings." 78 WVith the throne in danger of being captured by the priests, is it necessary to assume that it was a new philosophy germinating in the mind of an ado- lescent genius that precipitated the move against the priests and temples especially when this phi- losophy was not new ? NVould it not be more reasonable to assume that it was a bold and drastic step taken by the temporal government in self- defense, in self-preservation ? To close the temples and confiscate their lands and revenues would be a doubly eflective political move: it would strengthen the throne at the same time that it weakened its rivals. It is significant to note that it was not a prtestood of the new god Aton who succeeded to the estates of Amon. Ikhnaton was himself the First Prophet of Aton, and as such assumed control of the vast wealth of his god. " This appropriation of the property of the temples," observes Moret, " shows us what lay beneath the religious revolution, the economic and political objects of the rupture." 79 It was probably not the first time that struggles for terrestrial power were carried on in terms of celestial ideology; it cer- tainly has not been the last. The break between Ikhnaton and the priests was therefore but the culmination of centuries of rivalry and competition between palace and temple. With the growing power of the priests a drastic move was necessary if the king was to retain his independence. For the temporal government it was do or die. The maturing philosophy of monotheism provided an excellent pretext and a weapon. But it was merely the means employed; it was not the cause.80 77 A Bistory of Egypt, p. 362. 78 Kings and Gods of SJgypt, p. 45- 79 The Nile and Egyptian (7ivilization, p. 324. 80 The position taken by some writers on this issue is rather curious. Thus, as we have already seen, Peet believes that " the increased power of the priesthood . . . was a circumstance which precipitated, if it did not IX What part did Ikhnaton himself play in the stirring events of his reign? As we have already seen, numerous authors tell us that this young genius, virtually single-handed, initiated this revo- lution and carried it forward by his zeal and his indomitable will. But what is this but inference ? What do we know dtrectly about Ikhnaton's actions and what may be reasonably inferred from known facts ? actually cause, the religious revolution of Ikhnaton " ("Contemporary Life and Thought in Egypt," p. 203; emphasis ours ) . On the very next page, however, he says that it is "only an inference " to explain the revolu- tion as a struggle between priests and king. Yet he aecepts Ikhnaton's " peculiar genius " about which we know absolutely rwothing directly as one of the causes of the revolution ! In another essay, also, Peet diseounts the political aspect of the revolution and portrays Ikhnaton as a theologian ( " Akhenaten, Ty, Nefertete and Mutnezemt " ) . He explains the failure of Ikhna- ton's revolution in terms of a conflict of philosophies rather than as a clash of political forces ("Contempo- rary Life and Thought," p. 207) . But why did the Aton religion fail ? Why could it not win out over older beliefs? This is something that Peet's theory does not explain. Wallis Budge says that Ikhnaton failed " be- cause his religion did not appeal to the tradition and religious instincts and susceptibilities [whatever they are, L.A.W.] that already existed among the Egyptians " ( Tutan7chamen etc., p. 152 ) . But is not this begging the very question at issue ? Why did IkEnaton's qeelipion fail to appeal to the EJgyptians? To say that a theo- logical revolution failed because the new creed could win no converts is merely to say that it failed. It is like saying that a fire went out because it quit burning. Thus we see that those who interpret the revolution of Ikhnaton's reign as a philosophical, or theological, aSair account for political events in terms of rival philoso- phies, but they do not explain the philosophies. Our theory does both. It explains the struggIe between Ikhnaton and the priests in terms of the structure of civil societies and the function of the State-Church as an integrative and regulative mechanism. And it ex- plains the philosophies as instruments used by priests and king in this struggle. The philosophy of Ikhnaton failed because the political and economic power of the priesthoods was greater than that of the Pharaoh's party. In this connection we may consider the close rela- tionship between Queen Hatshepsut and Senenmut. SteindorS and Seele wonder what it was that eaused Hatshepsut to heap honors and favors upon this man. The " manner [in which] he forged the bonds which brought him in elose relations with his royal mistress . . . is a closed page of history" they say (op. cit., p. 41).

The Culture Process In the first place, if we take Elliot Smith's estimate of his age at the time of his death, based upon an examination of his supposed skeletal remains, Ikhnaton was but a boy of nine, or at most thirteen, when he ascended the throne. The "revolution" would have been well under way, therefore, when he was fifteen or nineteen. It has seemed so incredible that a youth could have accomplished all this " despite the precocity of youth in the east," that, as Professor Peet has observed, " archaeologists one and all fought shy of accepting so great an improbability." 81 They therefore put pressure upon Elliot Smith to raise his estimate of Ikhnaton's age. He did increase it from twenty-six to thirty but "he was not pre- pared to go further " at that time. More recently, however, he has been persuaded that Ikhnaton suffered from Dystocia, "one of the principal symptoms of which is the failure of the bones to knit properly . . . ossification ceases to be a test of age." The archeologists may now have Ikhna- ton as old as they wish ! 82 The view that Ikhnaton must have been more than a boy during the early years of his reign because tremendously important events took place at that time is a curious one to take. Must the life of a great nation stand still, must history mark time, until boy kings grow up ? It is rather a woman and as such should not ascend the throne of god-men. Senenmut " had in early youth entered service in the temple of Amun at Karnak and before long had successively occupied a series of important posts" (loc. cit.). In short, he was an adroit and successful priestly politician and a powerful member of the priestly party. Hatshepsut needed help to seize and hold the throne. Senenmut brought to her side the aid of a powerful priesthood. Hatshepsut richly rewarded him for his support. In the light of our theory, the relationship between them does nof seem obscure at all but rather obvious. Priests and kings serve their own respective interests as does every other class in society. VVhen their interests diverge they fight each other, as in the case of Ikhnaton or Henry VIII. When, however, each can serve his own interest by helping the other, they will cooperate, as in the case of Hatshepsut and Senenmut. 81 ;; Akhenaten, Ty, etc.," p. 86. See, also, D. E. Derry " Note on the Skeleton Hitherto Believed to be that of King Akhenaten,'? p. 115 ( Anxales du Service des Antiqqbites de L'Xgypte, Tome XXXI, pp. 115-119, 1931), and R. Engelbach, " The So-Called Coffin of Akhenaten,&gt;' p. 99 (Annales du Service etc., XXXI, pp. 98-114, 1931) for similar expressions of this point of view. 82 Peet, " Akhenaten, Ty, etc.," p. 86. generally admitted that Tutankhamun was but a boy of nine when he ascended the throne. New- berry 83 believes that Ay "must have been the dominating personality in Egypt's political afEairs " at this time. SteindorfE and Seele 84 assume that the boy king was " completely under the control of Eye," and Pendlebury 85 believes that Nefertiti's influence upon Tutankhamun must have kept him faithful to the new religion while she lived. If we can have a boy king, with actual rule by others, in the case of Tutankhamun, why not with Ikhna- ton ? In this connection we may recall that Louis XIII of France ascended the throne at the age of nine years, Louis XIAT at only five. Peter the Great came to the throne when he was ten; Charles XII of Sweden, at the ripe old age of fifteen. In speaking of Hatshepsut, Breasted takes it for granted that a powerful group of nobles and officials supported her and worked with her as a means of serving their own interests. He points out that " the fortunes and probably the lives of these men were identified with the success and the dominance of Hatshepsut; they therefore took good care that her position should be main- tained." 86 This sounds reasonable and is in accord with everything we know about ruling cliques everywhere, from Julius Caesar to Hitler, Stalin, or Franklin Roosevelt. One man may be the titular head of the government. But without the aid and support of a powerful group of fellow politicians no one, be he king, pope, president, or dictator, can stay in offlce very long. There is evidence of such a group surrounding young Ikhnaton. Breasted remarks that, idealist and dreamer though he was, "Ikhnaton under- stood enough of the old policy of the Pharaohs to know that he must hold his party by practical rewards." 87 Numerous reliefs show Ikhnaton re- warding his followers with gold and honors for their allegiance. Ramose, the Vizir, is shown " loaded with gifts by the Pharaohs, as though in reward for his allegiance." 88 One relief shows Ikhnaton, his wife and daughters showering gold upon Meryra, who had become High Priest of 83"King AJr, the Successor of Tutankhamun," p. 51 (Journ. Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 18, pp. 50-a2 1932). 8 Op. crt. p. 223. 8S Tel ? el-Amarna, p. 29. 86 A Eistory of Egypt, p. 272. 87 Ibid-, p. 367 88 Weigall, Op. cit., p. 71-</page><page sequence="15">WHITE: IkEnaton: The Great Man vs. The Culture Process loS Aton, "on some occasion when he had been par- ticularly successful in collecting the yearly dues of the temple . . ." " Abundant are the rewards,?' Meryra cries upon being installed as High Priest, " which the Aton knows to give when his heart is pleased.nn 89 And another one of Ikhnaton's lieu- tenants says with disarming frankness: "How prosperous is he who hears thy teaching of life ! " 90 All this sounds strangely familiar. To anyone who is familiar with the political machines of American cities and states, or to one who knows anything about the organization and conduct of ruling cliques anywhere in the world, with their community of interests and rewards for " faithful service " and supportn this picture of ancient Egypt will present no mystery. Whether Ikhnaton was a dominant figure or only a figure-head is im- material. In either case we have a dominant, ruling clique. They possess the power, they control the wealth, and they share the spoils. It is an old familiar pattern. Breasted and Weigall try to put a religious and philosophic complexion upon this tight little political machine that ruled and exploited Egypt. Weigall comments upon the rewards bestowed upon those who were intelligent enough to grasp the lofty concepts taught by Ikhnaton,91 and Breasted speaks of the "nucleus of men who really appreciated the ideal aspects of the king's teaching." 92 But the anatomy of machine politics shows so clearly through its ideological vestments that both are obliged to admit that many of Ikhnaton's followers were probably more concerned with the very earthly desire for riches and honors than with a lofty view of the cosmos. X Every effort has been made to extoll the originality and uniqueness of Ikhnaton and to emphasize his importance as an individual in the culture history of Egypt. He is but a boy when he ascends the throne, and only an adolescent when the "revolution " gets well under way. " Still, when one calls to mind the infant prodigies, the child preachers who stir an audience at an early- age," Weigall writes93 "one rnay credit a boy of 89lbid., pp. 144, 139. 90 Breasted, A History of Egypt, p. 369. 91 op. cit., p. 71. 92 A Bistory of Egypt, p. 369. 93 Op. cit., p. 98. eighteen or nineteen with the planning of a new city " and the founding of a new religion. Weigall does not cite any specific examples of child prod- igies; perhaps he was thinking of the boy Jesus teaching the elders. Ikhnaton's anatomical and psychological pecu- liarities llave been used to support the conception of him as a phenomenon among men. " His skull was misshapen," NVeigall tells us, " and he must have been subject to occasional epileptic fits." He thinks the king must have had hallucinations, also.94 Some great men have been epileptic- Mohammed and Napoleon, for example. Religious leaders often have hallucinations. If, therefore, Ikhnaton was an epileptic and had hallucinations, it would indicate that he was a most unusual phe- nomenon at least so it was reasoned apparently. But what basis is there for Weigall's supposi- tions ? Neither epilepsy nor hallucinations can be inferred from the sculptureas and reliefs nor from the supposed mummy of Ikhnaton, and we know of no evidence of these traits from contemporarfr records. There is, however, some evidence that indicates or at least strongly suggests that Ikhnaton was pathological in some respects, but this evidence is confused, self-contradictory at points, and cer- tainly inconclusive. The statues and reliefs, according to Moret, depict Ikhnaton as " a stripling of medium height, with slender bones and delicate modellingj' at the time of his ascension to the throne. Later, however, he " became rounded and ef3Ceminate a hermaphrodite figure with prominent breasts, wide hips and thighs too much curved, which rnakes one suspect a morbid nature, with some pathological flaw." 95 Sir Marc A. Ruffer speaks of "the pathological obesity" of Ikhnaton, al- though his face, neck and legs were thin. " Where the king is represented distributing collars o-f gold," says this author, " his abdomen actually hangs over the edge of the balcony, a most realistic piece of portraiture." 96 But in balcony scenes reproduced in Breasted's A ffistory of Egypt (Fig. 139) and Moret, The Nile and Egyptian Ctviltza- tton (Fig. 63), and in other works, he is show as a very slender man indeed. Gardiner says " the 94 Op. cit., pp. 46, 51, 91. 95 The lile and Egypt*an Civilization, p. 319. 96 Studies in the Polaeopathology of Egypt, edited by R. L.

Thus, the evidence of representations in art is inconsistent and inconclusive. NVhen we turn to the mummy supposed by some to be that of Ikhnaton, we find the picture so confused and full of contradictions that we are inclined to give up in despair and conclude that for the present at least the evidence is insufficient to warrant a definitive verdict of any kind. Wei- gall 98 says that " there can be no doubt that the mummy found in the Tomb of Queen Tiy was that of Akhnaton." Elliot Smith,99 the British anatomist who examined the skeletal remains, believed that " we have the most positive evidence that these bones are the remains of Khouniatonou [Ikhnaton]." Other scholars, however, have, on the basis of researches, since the skeleton in ques- tion was found, come to deny or to doubt that the bones are those of Ikhnaton. Thus, Kurt Sethe is convinced that certain evidence " proves " that the body cannot have been that of the heretic king: " For us it is sufficient that the body cannot in any case be that of the king in whose cofEn it found a resting place." loo A decade laterS R. Engelbach expressed his conviction that the mummy was not that of Ikhnaton; he thinks it is the remains of Smenkhkere.l°l Derry shares Engelbach's view in this matter.l02 Peet has expressed his doubt.l03 And Pendlebury says that "there is every reason to suppose that it is his [i. e., Smenkhkara's] skeleton, found in the cache of Queen Ty at Thebes, which has so long passed for that of Akhenaten." 104 The age at time of death of the person whose skeleton is under consideration has been the sub- ject of much debate, also. Elliot Smith originally estimated the age at death at 24 to 26 years. But, as we have seen, archeologists were very unwilling 97 Op. cit., p. 858. 98 Op. cit., p. xvii. 99 The Royol SIummies, p. 51; see, also, p. 54 (Cairo, 1912 ) . 100 Kurt Sethe, " Beitrage zur Geschichte Amenophis IV," (Xachrichten von der Ronigtichen Gesellschatt der Wissenschatten zu Gottingen, Philologisch-historische Klasse aus dem Jahre 1921, Berlin, 1921), pp. 127-128 ( translation ) . 01 op. cit. 102 op. cit. 103 ;; Akhenaten, Ty, etc." 104 Tell el-Amarna, p. 9. to accept this estimate since it would have made Ikhnaton but a boy when he became king and hence would have been too young to do all that he was supposed to have done. Under considerable pressure from the archeologists, Elliot Smith reconsidered. He came to the conclusion that the bones showed signs of " a rare disorder, only recently recognized by physicians," known as Dys- tocia adiposo-genitalis. " One of the effects of this condition," he says, " is to delay the process of the consolidation of the bones." 105 Therefore, he con- cludes, the person in question may have been as old as thirty or even thirty-six at the time of his death. But, he cannot resist adding, the bones still appear to him to be those of a man who died in his early twenties ! Professor Derry believes that the bones indicate an age of not more than twenty-three years. Regarding the pathology of the individual, there is flat contradiction as well as confusion. Elliot Smith, who was the first to examine the skeleton, was convinced that he had had hydrocephalus. A. R. Ferguson, Professor of Pathology in the Cairo School of Medicine, who also examined the cranium declared, according to Elliot Smith, that "the signs of hydrocephalus were unquestionable." 106 Derry, who examined the cranium after further restoration of it, de- clared that "the conformation of the skull does not support the statement that the person to whom it belonged suffered from hydrocephalus . . . It is indeed the very reverse of the shape produced by hydrocephalus," 107 (emphasis ours). In view of the evidence and conflicting testi- mony, we believe we would be justified in drawing the folloving conclusions: 1. We do not know whose skeleton was found; 2. Its age is somewhat uncertain but probably not more than twenty-five years; and 3. The clinical diagnosis is inconclusive. XI Attempt has also been made to account for Ikhnaton's greatness by claiming that he was of foreign extraction. Weigall says that "it must always be remembered that the king had much foreign blood in his veins." 108 Ruffer suggests that "his peculiar genius may have been due to 105 Tutankhamer6, p. 84 ( London, 1923 ) . l oa The Royal gu f lmies, pp 54 55 1070p.cit.,p.ll7. 108 Op. cit., p. 69.</page><page sequence="17">WHITE: IkEnaton: T7ze- Great Man, vs. Thes Culture Process 107 failed, as fail it must; the ecclesiastic aspect of social integration and regulation has not yet been eliminated from any nation so far, as the re-estab- lishment of the church in the Soviet Union makes emphatically clear. The contest between church and state in Egypt continued after Ikhnaton's death with the priests growing in power as they had in the reigns before his time. The theology of monotheism collapsed for the time being but we can trace this current of thought in the cen- turies following Ikhnaton. In short, the stirring events of Ikhnaton's reign can be accounted for as a part of a great process of cultural change and development. And we can explain this process in terms of itself. It is composed of complexes and classes of cultural elements philosophic, political, economic which continually act and react upon one another, producing changes of all sorts, new combinations and syntheses, and new alignments. We can explain this culture process in ancient Egypt in exactly the same way that we can account for the challges brought about in American culture by the introduction of the automobile. We do not need to call upon great men or upon psychological forces to make them intelligible. What does the anthropomorphic, psychological- the Great Man interpretation have to offer ? In the first place, we must ask, What could a man, a human organism, of exceptional quality and ability have done in this or any situation except to respond to it to work with the materials at hand, to try to cope with the problems con- fronting him; in short, to fit himself to the culture process that is his context? A man of superior neuro-sensory-glandular-muscular make-up might have made a better, i. e., more effective, response than one of inferior brains and physique, but the pattern of the response would have been substan- tially the same because it would have been deter- mined by the same cultural situation. Further- more, the difference between the mentality of one man and another is slight indeed when measured against the background of an age-old cultural pro- cess. So that even if Ikhnaton were an organism of exceptionally fine quality, this fact would not at all suffice to explain the events of his reign. But we do not know that Ikhnaton was an organism of superior quality. On the contrary, virtually all that we know about him indicates that he was a diseased and hence an inferior organism. Why, then, has historian after his- the foreign blood in his veins." 109 Numerous authors believe that Ikhnaton's mother, Tiy, was not an Egyptian, although Breasted says that " there is not a particle of evidence to prove her of foreign birth, as is so often claimed." 110 Elliot Smith finds evidence of non-Egyptian ancestry in the facial skeleton.l1l The differences between Ikhnaton and his father are "far more than individual differences, for they are racial. Amenothes IIIrd's face is cast in the Egyptian mould: but in the case of Whouniatonou, the jaw is typically Armenoid, a fact most clearly demon- strated in the form of its ascending ramus." It would not be surprising at all if Ikhnaton should prove to have " foreign blood in his veins." We know that a number of Egyptian kings before Ikhnaton had wives from Asia. But what is the significance of this foreign blood or the Armenoid jaw so far as intelligence or character, monotheism or political reform, are concerned? The answer can only be: precisely nothing. XII IIow then are the striking events which took place in Egypt between 1375 and 1358 B. C. to be explained? We can choose between two types of interpretation: the one is psychological and anthropomorphic; the other is culturological. What are their relative merits ? We have already seen that what took place during Ikhnaton's reign was but a continuation and a culmination of cultural trends that had been going on for centuries before the "Heretic King " was born. Philosophic development toward monotheism was already well advanced before Ikhnaton's birth. The rivalry between the throne and the temple, the struggle between priest and king for power, was already hoary with age in 1386 B. C. More than that, this sort of competi- tion is a characteristic of all nations where the temporal and ecclesiastical aspects of the central integrative mechanism are structurally differen- tiated. We observe these cultural trends continuing in Egypt for centuries after Ikhnaton's death. The attempt of the throne to eliminate the eccle- siastical component of the integrative mechanism 109 Op. cit., p. 332. 0 A History of Egypt, p. 329- The Royal Mummies, P 55-</page><page sequence="18">108 WHITE: IkEnaton: The Great Alarb vs. The Culture Process composed the magnificent hymn to Aton, cannot be considered as lacking in energy, or as a degen- erate, or an effeminate person." Thus, certain facts indicating pathology are not permitted for a moment to interfere with a cherished illusion of historical interpretation. Surely the mastery of myth over realism could go no further. Sometimes these psychological interpretations contradict each other. Thus Sir Marc cites Ikhna- ton's "pathological obesity" as a possible reason for the loss of Egypt's Asiatic empire. " The extreme corpulency of the king," he writes, " may have been responsible for his politics. On account of his obesity he probably disliked physical eser- tion, and this may have been the reason why he persistently refused to lead his army to war when the outlying provinces were threatened." 114 But when he surveys the great achievements of the Eighteenth Dynasty, he is impressed with the " tireless energy " that characterized its rulers, Ikhnaton as well as Ahmose! 115 The fact is that we know very little indeed about Ikhnaton as a political figure and virtually nothing about his personality and character. It is usually said that Amenhotep III was Ikhnaton's father, but Newberry asserts that this is merely arl assumption: "this is nowhere asserted on any Egyptian inscription." 116 Concerning the ances- try of other intimates of Ikhnaton his wife, Nefertiti, his " beloved " coregent Smenkhkere, and his son-in-law and successor, Tutankhamun- " nothing whatever is deSnitely known " (New- berry1l7). His age at the time of his accession has been much debated and is still uncertain. Evidence concerning his health and physical con- dition is so varied as to be virtually worthless. We do not know wlly he became estranged from his wife. We do not know how he met his death, whether from natural causes or by violence. And, finally, we do not know where he was laid to rest.ll8 If, therefore, we do not have adequate information of this sort, data on Ikhnaton as a king, a political institution, how could we expect to have any reliable information pertaining to his personality and character? Indeed, do we have any facts at all on this subject? 114 Op. ctt., p. 170. 116 Ibid., p. 333. llB "Ring Ay, the Successor of Tutankhamun," p. 51. 117 Ibid., p. 50. 118 Steindorff and Seele, op. cst., p. 222. torian explained this period of Egyptian history by pointing to the colossal genius of this man? The answer seems to be that, as we indicated at the outset, the old, primitive, anthropomorphic type of thinking that has been so popular for so many hundreds of thousands of years has not yet been outgrown. Science, and especially social science, is still too young to have made itsel! felt in historical interpretation to any great extent. And the science of culture is still so new as to make its proper designation, " culturology," sound outlandish.ll2 The pathetic thing about Great Man interpretations of history is that they leave the great man anexplained. It is like the medieval explanation of fossils: produced by " stone-making forces." What Breasted, Breigall, Moret, and others have done is to create a personality for Ikhnaton and then to explain events in the culture process by citing various traits of this personality. The image of Ikhnaton is created by inference: great events took place during his reign, therefore a great mind and will must have brought them about; the struggle with the priesthoods was bitter and pro- longed, therefore Ikhnaton was a man of deter- mination and perseverance; a new era in art was inauguratedn therefore the young king was original and creative. IIe must have had " foreign blood in his veins " because his ideas were so novel. IIe must have been older than his supposed skeletal remains indicate because one so young could not have accomplished so much, and so on. We may cite a particularly striking example of this. Sir Marc A. Ruffer, who made a study of the palaeo- pathology of ancient Egypt, and who consequently was intimately acquainted with the evidence indi- cating Ikhnaton's abnormality, nevertheless argues as follows: 113 ';. . . a monarch who founds a monotheistic religion in the teeth of the opposition of a most powerful priesthood, who builds a new town where he worships his god away from old associations and among congenial surroundings, who endows that new town with beautiful temples, who patronizes a new form of art, and who perhaps 112 Cf. V. Gordon Childe's footnote 19 in " Archaeology and Anthropology" p. 251 ( Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, Vol. 2, 1946). See my previously men- tioned (footnote 2) essay "The Expansion of the Scope of Science," for a discussion of this new science. 11S Op. cit, pp. 332-333.</page><page sequence="19">WHITE: Ikhnclton: The Great Man vs. TheJ Culture Process 109 That Ikhnaton actually lived is not questioned, and he must therefore have had a personality and character. But these cannot be inferred or de- duced from the political history of Egypt. There is sharp disagreement today concerning the per- sonality and character of the late Franklin D. Roosevelt, about whom we have a vast amount of factual data obtained by direct observation. The same might be said of Lenin, Hitler, Wilson, or any other outstanding political figure of recent times. What then can we hope to know or under- stand of this remote Egyptian king as a person? Yet students without number give us the most intimate and personal details about him, and they do it with confidence and assurance. Indeed, they give the impression of drawing upon the report of an exhaustive psychiatric analysis. The extent to lvhich the personality and char- acter of Ikhnaton have been created ad hoc by scholars to explain the facts of Egyptian culture history is sometimes remarkable. One gets the impression that Weit,all could not have known his hero better had he been a member of Amen- hotep III's household at the time of Ikhnaton's birth and had associated with him daily until his death. Weigall describes him as ". . . a quiet, studious boy, whose thoughts wandered in fair places, searching for that happiness which his physical condition had denied to him. His nature was gentle; his young heart overflowed with love. He delighted, it would seem, to walk in the gardens of the palace, to hear the birds singing, to watch the fish in the lake, to smell the flowers, to follow butterflies, to warm his small bones in the sun- shine." 119 Only where one knows so little can one write so much; the absence of facts gives the imagination free rein. Thus in the Great Man interpretation of history the known facts of the culture process are ex- plained by the pseudo-facts of psychology, the known by the unknown. A worse error of reason- ing would be hard to find within or outside the field of scholarship. XIII To be sure, not all students of Egypt have inter- preted the history of Ikhnaton's reign in this anthropomorphic fashion; manv have seen clearly that these political and theological events were the 119 Op. cit., p. 52. logical expression of a cultural historical process. As a matter of fact, Breasted himself describes and documents this process very well indeed as our quotations from his works show. But he seems to have given relatively little weight to cultural historical interpretation as compared with bio- graphic and psarchiatric explanation. Let us turn now briefly to those who have emphasized, or at least have called specific attention to, the process of culture history in their interpretations of Ikhnaton. " Up to a few years ago," writes T. E. Peet, " it was customary to believe that this entire movement was a product of the brain of Ikhnaton . . . This we now know to be incorrect . . . it [is] now necessary to see in the movement not merely the personal influence of an original genius, but also the inevitable product of the conditions of the time 120 James Baikie writes: " It is evident, therefore, that Atenism was not the sudden break with all the religious past of Egypt which it is often represented as being; . . . [it] had its roots deep in native soil, and could be traced as far back as you can trace anything in the history of the land." 121 John Pendlebury declares that Ikhnaton was not "the first individual in history, as has been claimed," and points out that actually " we know less about him personally than about many of his predecessors." 122 Also, he not only recognizes the antecedents of the new religion but suggests htinoan inspiration for the new art at Akhetaten which has so often been attributed to the genius of Ikhnaton himself. This " startling change . . . in the spirit and outlook of Egyptian art," he says, " can only be attributed to a sudden intensification of Minoan influence," 123 occasioned by the destruc- tion of iEEnossos and the collapse of the Minoarl empire. H. Frankfort believes that the art of Ikhnaton may have derived some inspiration from the works of the reign of Thutmosis.l24 We also find a live appreciation of the role of cultural forces in history in the writings of Stein- dorff and Seele, P. E. Newberry, S. R. K. Glanville, 120 ( Contemporary Life and Thought in Egypt," p. 205. 121 The Amarna Age, pp. 304, 311; see, also, pp. 313-14. 122 Tell el-Amarna, p. xiv.

Many of these students do, however, as we have pointed out earlier, invoke the peculiar traits of Ikhnaton's personality as a means of accounting for the remarkable events of his reign. XIV What we have said about Ikhnaton so far would apply to any great man who has been invoked to explain historical events. We now wish to turn to aspects of the scholar's image of the :Heretic :King that are peculiar to him. When Breasted, Weigall and others create a phe- nomenal person to explain remarkable historical events they are, as we have seen, following a tradition that has flourished since the Old Stone Age. But they had an added reason for their exaltation of Ikhnaton. This is to be found in the religious outlook of these authors. It would appear from their discussion of Ikllna- ton's role in philosophic evolution that Breasted and Weigall believe that there is a God, that there is only one god, and it would seem, Be is an English-speaking, Protestant deity. They appear to assume also --their assumptions are implicit rather than explicit, as is so frequently the case in philosophic or scientific discussions, and the more basic the premise the more likely it is to remain unexplicit that mankind as a whole has been moving slowly toward a realization that there is only one god and one true faith the one taught by Jesus. As culture advanced, mankind came closer and closer to a recognition of the one true GEod and to sense the precepts that were eventually to be expounded by His Son. Now, for some reason which these authors do not make clear, God the one and only God, our God, the English-speaking, Protestant God- decided to reveal himself to this Egyptian king about 1400 B. C. Ikhnaton caught the vision, was fired by it, and thereafter devoted his whole life, with passionate zeal, to an attempt to establish the true faith. But he failed. The people were not ready for it. Or, perhaps God miscalculated and revealed himself too soon. But though this adventure in monotheism failed all was not lost. The precious truth had been let out and truth cannot and will not die. It was somehow communicated to the Hebrews who, after some centuries of incubation, were to bring it forth again in the person of Jesus Christ. Such is our theory about Breasted and Weigall. Let us now see what there is to support it. Weigall believes that Ikhnaton was "the first man to whom God revealed himself . . . For the first time in the history of man the real meaning of God, as we now understand it, had been com- prehended." 125 Osiris was but a mythological being. So were Ptah, Set, and Horus. EveIl Amon-Re was but a superstition. But the God who revealed himself to Ikhnaton was genuine; this time it was real. Ikhnaton was, according to Breasted, a " God- intoxicated man, whose mind responded with mar- vellous sensitiveness and discernment to the visible evidences of God about him. He was fairly ecstatic in his sense of the beauty of the eternal and uni- versal light . . .126 AVhile to the traditional Pharaoh the state god was only the triumphant conqueror, who crushed all peoples and drove them tribute-laden before the Pharaoh's chariot, Ikhna- ton saw in him the beneficent father of all men. It was the first time in history that a discerning eye has caught thqws great universal truth," 127 (emphasis ours) . Ikhnaton devoted himself with " feverish fanati- cism " to spreading the true faith, " fully con- vinced that he might entirely recast the world of religiOn.nn 128 After Ikhnaton had caught the vision of the true god he became impatient with the paganism of his fellow countrymen: "Boldly he looked to God as a child to its father; and having solved what he deemed to be the riddle of life, there was no place in his mind for aught but an open, fearless adoration of the creator . . . Akhnaton was the sworn enemy of the tableturners of his day, and the tricks of priestcraft . . . were anathema to his pure mind " ( Weigall 129 ) . With a revolution at home on his hands it is not surprising that the king did not have sufEcient means to protect Egyptian possessions abroad. But our authors have another explanation for Egypt's loss of empire at the close of the Eigh- 12S op. cit., p. 106. 126 The Development of Religton and Thought tn Ancient lSgypt, p. 334. 127 A Histcy of Egypt, p. 377 l28Breasted, "Ikhnaton," p. 80; The Development of Relipion and Thoupht in Ancient Egypt, p. 342. 129 op. cit., p. 175.</page><page sequence="21">WHITE: Ikhnaton: The Great Marb vs. Tiw0 Cqllture Process  was in S;ria or Palestine before the time of Christ " ( Weigall 134 ) . Both B] easted and Weigall call attention to similarities between Egyptian hymns to Aton and Psalms of the lffebrews. Breasted points out that about " a chapter and a half of the Book of Proverbs i s largely drawn verbatim from the Wisdom of Amenemope; that is, the Hebrew ver- sion is practically a literal translation from the Egyptian." 135 The " teachings of the Egyptian sages exerlsed a profound influence on Hebrew religious thinking and, having thus effected lodg- ment in Palestine, they had advanced through the first stage in their long transition from Egypt to us of the nlodern world." 136 Thus Ikhnaton is not merely the Great Man who moves and shapes the culture history of Egypt; he becomes the instrument of Divine Purpose. Through him did God first reveal himself to man. But the time was not yet ripe; paganism and idolatry were still too strongly entrenched. So the revelation ras handed on, perhaps from Joseph to Moses, clown the ages until He who came to redeem us 11 was born. Breasted was once enrolled in a Protestant theological school. It is probable that Weigall was a Protsestant, also. It is of some interest therefore to note the way in which the Roman Catholic church regards this " God-intoxicated man." Pla-inly, they do not like him. " With the single exce otion of Amenhotep IV," says the Catholic Ellcyclopedia,l37 " who allowed himself to be drawn into a scheme to reform the Egyptian religion, all its kings were wise and just rulers." But, after all, no ecclesiastical hierachy is likely to approve of a temporal ruler who closes temples, drives out priests, and confiscates their wealth.

It was because ( 1 ) Ikhnaton was too engrossed in his new philosophy to concern himself with politics, and (2) like Christ, he was opposed to brute force. " Instead of gathering the army so sadly needed in Naharin, Amenhotep IV immersed himself heart and soul in the thought of the time, and the philosophizing theology of the priests was of more importance to him than all the provinces of Asia . .-. It shows the astonishing leniency of Ikhnaton in a manner which would indicate that he was opposed to measures of force " (Breasted 130). So he sat " singing hymns to the Disk at Tell el-Amarna while the vast empire be- queathed to him by his fathers " went to pieces.l3l Weigall tells us that Egypt lost her empire because it was against Ikhnaton's principles to fight. lffe " had the power to let loose upon Asia an army which would silence all insult but [he] did not find such a step consistent with his principles . . .

Our authors see in Ikhnaton the first expression of the true faith that is now ours. " The faith of the patriarchs is the lineal ancestor of the Christian faith; but the creed of Akhnaton is its isolated prototype. One might believe that Almighty God had for a moment revealed him- self to Egypt, and had been more clearly, though more momentarils, interpreted there than ever lffe 130 A gistorg of Egypt, pp. 356, 385- 131 Peet, "Akhenaten, Ty, etc.," pp. 106-07. 132 op cit., pp. 196, 202, 207. 133 A History of Egypt, p. 377; The Dawn of aon science, p. 296. In this connection Pendlebury writes- " So much has been written about Akhenaten in the character of a Christ before his time that it must be pointed out that Atenism was in no sense a way of life but merely an exercise in theology," ( Tell el-Amarna p. 160).</page><page sequence="22">WHITE: Ikhnaton: The Great Man vs. Thel CqlZture Process 2 and devoted their vast resources . . . to the erection of magnificent temples . . . which they richly endowed ) 138 these rulers he finds were " wise and Just." It will be noted, too, that this writer says that Ikhnaton " allowed himself to be drawn into" the scheme to reform Egyptian religion; in other words, that the movement against the priesthoods was a political device of temporal politicians to safeguard or enhance their power. Catholic scholars do not take much stock in the theory that God revealed himself first to an Egyptian. They scout the notion that Moses may have been influenced by the teachings of Ikhnaton: "Although Moses, learned as he was in the wisdom of the Egyptians, may have been indebted to an Egyptian model for one or two external features in his organization of Divine worship, he was, thanks to the Divine inspiration, entirely original in the establishment of the Jewish priest- hood, which is based on the unique idea of Jahweh's covenant with the Chosen People." 139 The author of the article " Egypt" in the Catholic Encyclopedia is much too sophisticated in the ways of politicians whether temporal or ecclesiastical to believe that it was Ikhnaton's supernatural vision and religious zeal that ani- mated him. " The effort of Amenhotep IX," he writes, " to introduce the cult of his only god, Aton, was perhaps not prompted exclusively by a religious ideal, as is generally supposed." He be- lieves the long trend toward monotheism in Egypt " must have been encouraged by the Pharaohs in their capacity rather of political than of religious rulers of the nation." 140 Jewish scholars, too, reject the idea that Moses may have been influenced by Ikhnaton. They admit that the "concept of Divine Unity has appeared among other religious and philosophie groups," but insist that " :El:ebrew monotheism i3 UniqUe, 141 138 Loc. cxt. 139 From the article " Priesthood," by Joseph Pohle, in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. XII, p. 410 (New York, 1911). 140 op. cit., p. 345. 141 Abraham Shusterman, "Monotheism," in The Uni- versal Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. VII, p. 624 (New York, 1942 ) . It will be recalled ( footnote 136 ) that James Baikie was unwilling to admit that Hebrew psalmists may have drawn upon Egyptian hymns. Now Baikie} was a clergyman. Thus it would appear that clerical scholars-Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish alikare If Ikhnaton was indeed the means of the first revelation of God to man, it was apparently, as we have suggested, the Protestant deity who made himself known. XV The drama of Ikhnaton and monotheism is excellent material for the artist as well as for the historian and scientist. Thomas Mann use.s Joseph in Egypt as the vehicle for his message to a world sick and in turmoil. Amenhotep III, the father of Ikhnaton, was the pharaoh of Egypt during the earlier part of Joseph's life, according to Harry Slocllower's 142 interpretation of Afann's novel. Potiphar, the eunuch husband of Mut, was allied with the growing Aton movement; Mut, with the party of Amon. The symbolism of Mut's longing for Joseph and her attempt to seduce him, Joseph's rejection of Mut and his subsequent fate, is intriguing but does not concern us here. Ikhnaton may have been the pharaoh before whom Joseph was brought after he had interpreted his fellow prisoner's dreams. Mann does not identify him by name, but describes him as follows: 143 " Pharao is seventeen. This hypersensitive and tender youth, a searcher of God, like Joseph's fore- fathers, and enamoured of a dreamy religion of love, has ascended the throne during the time of Joseph's imprisonment. IIe is an anticipating, a premature Christian, the mythical prototype of those, who are on the right way, but not the right ones for that way." We can only conclude that this pharaoh was indeed Ikhnaton. Like Breasted and Weigall, Mann sees in him the instrument of God's revela- tion to man. But, because he " was not the right one for that way,' it remained for the Jews to keep the vision alive until the coming of the Messiah, our Christ. Sigmund Freud, too, has been captured by the engrossing theme of Ikhnaton, Moses, and mono- unwilling to admit any connection between their own religious faith and tradition and another; historical connections are not in keeping with divine revelation. Their bias, springing from vested interest, is of course understandable; but it is hardly conducive to sound scholarship. 142 lthomas Mann's Joseph Story, p. 46 (New York, 1 938 ) . 14S Thomas Mann, " The Theme of the Joseph Novels," p. 13 (Washington, 1942).</page><page sequence="23">WHI1'E: IkEnaton: The Great SIan, vs. Thel Culture Process 113 theism.l44 EIe assumes that Moses was an Egyp- tian-mose is an ending of many Egyptian proper names and a devout follower of Ikhnaton. Frus- trated in his desire and attempt to monotheize the Egyptians, Moses determined to give the new the- ology to the Hebrews then in Egypt. In this way the philosophy of Ikhnaton was perpetuated. XVI " Until Ikhnaton the history of the world had been but the irresistible drift of tradition. All men had been but drops of water in the great current " (Breasted). Now that our study is done we must conclude that history is still the3 irresistible flow of the stream of culture and that all men are but chips floating on that stream. Our inquiry has shown conclusively that the events of Ikhnaton's reign were but links in a chain that extended for centuries before and after his life- time. The links were more striking or emphatic no doubt, but links, nevertheless. We can come to no other conclusion than that the general trend of events would have been the same had Ikhnaton been but a sack of sawdust. The Great Man theory of historical interpre- tation is, however, one of compelling power and appeal: " A man Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of a man. An institflion is the lengthened shadow of one man; as Monachism of the Hermit Antony; the Reformation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson . . . all history rosolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons," ( Emerson, Essay on Self Reliance) . Thus wrote the man who provided the intelli- gentsia of America with the verbal reflexes called " thought ' for so many years. The conception is still popular. A recent well known anthropologist, Edgar Lee EIewett, has explained great epochs in history by the simple device of pointing to the Great Men who made them: Xerxes, Attila, Mohammed, Napoleon, liaiser Wilhelm, IIitler. All great " irruptions " of history have been " one man afEairs," he says.l45 In E. A. Eooton's view, 1s Cf. his Moses and Monothes7n (New York 1939 ) . 145 {; From Culture to Civilization," p. 140 (Ei Palacio July, 1942). " men like IIitler and Mussolini impose their evil wills upon stupid and suggestible masses." 146 And to Robert Andrews Millikan, wars are caused by " dictators filled with the lust of power and con- quest." 147 EIistory is " explained " by citing the Great Man. But how is the Great AIan accounted for? He isn't. EIe is either taken for granted or is said to be inexplicable. " Genius defies all laws " we are told by a scholar who "explains" the XE2eformation by citing the genius of Luther.l48 The Great BIan theory is, of course, the quin- tessence of anthropomorphism. It pictures man, like God, a first cause, a prime mover: " Let there be light and there was light . . . an institution is but the lengthened shadow of one man." Man ever creates himself in God's image. The Ikhnaton we meet in the sober studies of the scholars' pen is a sheer fictional character, no more real than EIamlet or IIuckleberry Finn. We know nothtng about him as a person that is certain and direct. And at every point where the Great Man theory conflicts with evidence it is the evi- dence that must give way. If the ossification of bones indicates a man who died too young to have done what the Great Man did, a way must be found to delay the process of ossification. If an empire is lost, it is because the Great Man is morally opposed to the use of force; or he is too fat and lazy to lead his army. If a new city is built the Great Man becomes a dynamo of energy. This Ikhnaton is nothing but the composite personifica- tion of all the political, social, military and phi- losophic events of his day. As such he is no different from Whirlwind Old Man, invented bv the Pueblo Indians to "explain" the spirals of dust in the hot desert air, or the John Bull who determines British foreign policy. And so it is with all Great Men, whether it be a Paul Bunyan of the folk or a GFeorge Washington of historians. It goes without saying that men dif3Ter in their talents and abilities. Some are silk purses bi- ologically; others are sows' ears. But it takes more than superior brains and glands to make a Great Man. Perhaps we should say exceptional rather 148 ff Morons into What?

Mohammed, for example, is said to have been an epileptic. It takes, then, more than exceptional natural endow- ment to make a Great Man; a certain concatena- tion of cultural forces and historical circumstances is required also. No one can be a great actor without a play, a stage, and an audience. Con- versely, a man of mediocre talents may become Great if chance and circumstance place him at the focal point of a tremendously significant historical event. In the process of cultural development, a Great Man is but the neural medium through which an important synthesis of culture elements takes place. Darwin, Newton, Beethoven, and Edison were men of this type. They were the neurological loci of important cultural events. To be sure, they nxay have been superior organisms. But had they been reared as swineherds Greatness would not have found them. In history, in politi- cal and social movements, the Great Man is that anatomical part of a social organism that func tions as a directive, regulative or integrative mech- anism. Abilityr epilepsyr chance, or both together, may have put him in this position. The Great Man is an instrument employed by a nation or a movement in the exercise of its functions. Torn from his context, the Great Man an exiled Napoleon, a Waiser sawing wood, the mutilated corpse of Mussolini, a Big Wame in a " War Crimes Trial" is but an insignificant hunk of human flesh. The measure of a Great Man in the life of nations can be taken when we see how independent of him the behavior of a nation is. The behavior of the social organism that is Russia has remained constant for decades and even centuries: expansion toward the east, tropismatic gropings toward warm- water ports, penetration of the Balkans, Pan- Slavism. Whether a Czar or a Commissar sits in the driver's seat is immaterial; the great organism goes on its own way unalterably. The same obser- vations may be made in the case of Germany. Whether the Great Man be Wilhelm, Bismarek, or Hitler, the organism that was Germany followed a constant and uniform course: Drang nach Osten, Lebensraum, colonies, commercial rivalry. The reasons for this uniformity of national behavior are of course plain: the land, the people who grow upon it, the resources of the land or its lack of them, its position with reference to other nations, the trade routes of the world, etc. These remain relatively constant and consequently the behavior of the social organism remains constant. Great Men and Ideologies do more to obscure these fundamental facts than to explain them. The Great WIan is the instrument, the Ideology the rationalization, of the social organism as it struggles for survival in the international jungle of nations.
