<plain_text><page sequence="1">Living with seabirds.-Bryan Nelson. 1986. Edin- burgh, Edinburgh University Press. viii + 253 pp., 63 black-and-white photographs, 2 figures, 3 maps. ISBN 0-85224-523-8. Distributed in North America by Columbia University Press. $25.00.-This book is the second in Edinburgh University Press' Island Biology series, which "aims to give a precise account of sci- entific results within a biographical work." The first half of the book is an account of Nelson's research on gannets on Bass Island; the second half covers his studies of other sulids on the Galapagos Islands and other sites. The author provides little new scientific insight into seabird biology. Instead, he offers a lively nar- rative of his life as a seabird biologist and naturalist in the 1960's. The style is much like Attenborough's in the Zoo Quest series: anecdotal and enthusiastic. He shows a flair for describing less tasteful aspects of gannet behavior, though some passages are rather too anthropomorphic. He describes the strengths and limitations of field research, and difficulties of study- ing animals that spend their nonbreeding lives at sea. This sort of book provides a forum for speculation and opinion that would not be accepted in the sci- entific literature, and Nelson takes full advantage, particularly in the field of conservation. Few of the photographs supplement the text, and some are of poor quality. Better photographs are found in Nelson's earlier works and, in fact, in most popular accounts of bird biology. Detailed descriptions of rit- ualized behaviors and a discussion of their possible descent add nothing to this piece. This work will be of little value as a reference for university libraries or ornithologists. It would be a worthwhile acquisition for community libraries and those interested in a popular account of natural his- tory, animal behavior, and ecology.-GLEN CHILTON.</page></plain_text>
