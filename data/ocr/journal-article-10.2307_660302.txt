AT the 488th meeting of the Society, held October 13, 1915, in the Public Library, jointly with the Medical Society of the District of Col- umbia, Dr. Ales Hrdli'ka, Curator in Physical Anthropology, U. S. Na- tional Museum, delivered an address on "The Evolution of Man in the Light of Recent Discoveries, and its Relation to Medicine." Human evo- lution is no longer a mere theory but a fixed part of natural history, better documented from day to day by substantial evidence. Its foundations rest upon many and important organic analogies; on actual physical remains of early man and perhaps even some of his predecessors; and on observations of the changes which are at present taking place in man. The analogies are (I) the evidence of evolution in all the better known mammals; (2) the relation of various stages of the embryonic develop- ment of man to grades of life represented by some lower vertebrates; (3) those of the mode of conception, of the laws of development, of all other vital functions, and in death; (4) similarities in organs, limbs, and all other physical as well as microscopic parts of the human body; (5) close similarities in the chemical constituents of the human body and those of other mammals; and (6) the frequent presence in man of vestiges of or reversions to anatomical features still present regularly in some lower animals. The physical evidence of man's evolution consists of a large series of skeletal remains dating from the early Pleistocene to the last prehistoric period. These remains show in general that the farther back we proceed the more primitive were the human features and the nearer to those of the lower primates. This evidence alone is quite conclusive although there are still of course, many important gaps in the line of this evidence, especially relating to the earlier periods, which however are gradually being filled in. The historical and recent changes in man show us that his evolution has not as yet been fully accomplished, but is still progressing, and that possibly among civilized white men it is progressing more rapidly than it has during most of its course. We see that the higher civilized white man has already in some respects outdistanced others, 141</page><page sequence="2">142 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 18, 1916 that he is rapidly diversifying, and that those who can not keep the ac- celerated pace are being eliminated by nature. Probably the most ob- vious changes are taking place in his teeth, which are gradually lessening in resistance, in size, and even in numbers-changes which in turn condition weakening and numerous disharmonies in the whole facial structure. The process of human evolution has close relations to medicine--- much closer, in fact, than is commonly appreciated by even the surgeon and physician. Evolution is not only constructive, but eliminative, involving weakening, degeneration, and eventual loss of parts which have become less useful, less functional. The progressive and retrogressive changes are not always harmonious or generally beneficial to the indivi- vidual, and they bring about many conditions which demand medical or surgical intervention. The process of evolution bears, however, stil, older relations to medicine. It has prolonged the periods of infancy, childhood, and senility in man, the most dangerous periods of an organ- ism; the assumption of the erect posture had necessarily adverse con- sequences, which probably have not yet been completely overcome, on the circulatory system and in seriously modifying the abdominal and pelvic drags as well as pressure, especially in pregnancy; it has intensified the sexual functions in man, the results of which are frequently untoward and even dangerous; it has caused an enlargement in the size of the head in the human foetus, which necessitated a consequent enlargement of the pelvic cavity, and there are doubtless still disharmonies between the two conditions; it has resulted in greater relative slenderness of bones, even in the skull, rendering them proportionately more liable to injuries; it has brought about greater delicacy of skin, with a consequent less re- sistance of the body to exposure; it has induced especially a great enlarge- ment of the brain, a process the results of which to this day offer many imperfections; and, finally, while evolution has doubtless improved vari- ous immunities in man, it is still very incomplete in this respect, and on the other hand it has evidently led to new dangers and predispositions. There seem to exist even some indications that it may in some of the most advanced groups adversely affect the ability of procreation. The evolution of man will continue, and in order that it shall proceed with the least harm and towards the greatest benefit of mankind, it will require the most enlightened and increasingly important help and service of all branches of medicine. The paper was well illustrated and briefly discussed.</page><page sequence="3">ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON 143 Meeting of October ig, 1915 AT the 489th meeting of the Society, held October 19, 1915, in the Public Library, Dr. D. S. Lamb, of the Army Medical Museum, read a paper on " The Medicine and Surgery of the Ancient Peruvians," giving first some account of the country and its people, their history, customs, food, and religion. We have no evidence of hospitals in old Peru. The people are said not to have studied the medicinal properties of their plants, although they well knew the properties of what is called Peruvian bark, used in malarial fevers. Whether syphilis or leprosy occurred among them is doubted. The same may be said of tuberculosis, although some writers, like Ashmead, ascribe the mutilations represented on their pottery to local skin tuberculosis, usually known as lupus. These mu- tilations have also been regarded as resulting from punishments or surgical operations. Three skin diseases are considered peculiar to the ancient Peruvians, the mirunta, caused by a worm entering the skin; the verrugas, a very fatal disease of a warty character that struck terror into Pizarro's soldiers in 1532; and the uta. They had the climatic, dietetic, respiratory, and heart diseases found elsewhere, and from similar causes. Malarial fevers prevailed and were usually of the tertian variety. Smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, and yellow fever were introduced by the Spaniards and their successors. The Peruvians had what seems to have been a typhus called tabardillo. Goitre prevailed and was said to be caused by drinking the turbid water from the mountains. They deformed the heads of their infants, very much as did the Flathead Indians of the northwestern United States, by pressure front and back; one tribe is said to do so still. Their injuries were necessarily, for the most part, much the same as now, with the exception of shot wounds and injuries caused in modern industrial occupations. , They scarified and let blood, reduced dislocations, used fixation apparatus for fractures as we do, covered open wounds, cut out pterygiums, and trephined the skull. This trephining was done either directly to relieve disease and injury or simply to let out the demon that caused the trouble. In discussing Dr. Lamb's paper, Dr. C. L. G. Anderson said that the predecessors of the Inca also, the people who built the megaliths at Tia- huanaco and the great fortress at Cuzco, likewise knew much about medi- cinal herbs. The Indians made infusions, decoctions, powders, and oint- ments of barks, leaves, berries, roots, and vines. A few remedies were obtained from the mineral kingdom, such as sulphur and salty earths. Certain baths and hot springs were utilized in curing rheumatism and various skin diseases. Garcilasso de la Vega says that the use of drugs</page><page sequence="4">144 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 18, 1916 was largely prophylactic and that after the disease was well established they left nature to work its cure, merely regulating the diet. The basal idea was to eliminate the evil, whether spirit or substance. Hence, purgatives and venesection were much in vogue, as among all nations. Throughout tropical America, the wood of the guayacan tree, lignum vitae, was held to be a specific for the venereal disease called by the Spani- ards las bubas. Sarsaparilla was said to be the great panacea about Guayaquil. The wonderful drugs coca and quina-quina, were peculiar to the Andean regions. The coca was chewed to ward off hunger and fatigue. Quina, later known as Peruvian bark, was the cure for fever. It was introduced into Europe about 1640. Among the common people, old women were herbalists. The newborn babe was bathed in cold water. Usually no midwife was employed. The Peruvians knew of many poisons. Witchcraft and divination were practised. Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt spoke of the idea of getting the evil spirit out of the patient as being common to all primitive peoples. In the Iroquois language the expression in case of sickness was "It is biting me," "biting my tooth," or "biting my head," according to the affected part. Dr. E. L. Morgan, among others who discussed the paper, considered that trephining probably had its origin in the idea of getting rid of the evil spirit but was continued as a custom because of the curative- results observed in some cases. Dr. Lamb, in response to an inquiry, said that the flattening of the head among the ancient Peruvians, as among the Flathead Indians, probably had no effect on the intellect because it was practised in infancy. Meeting of November 2, 1915 AT the 490th meeting of the Society, held November 2, 1915, in the Public Library, Dr. Walter Hough, of the U. S. National Museum, spoke on "Progress in Anthropology in California." He first discussed the problems connected with the populating of California by the Indians, giving a general view of the geographical obstacles and the avenues to the north and south by which migrants entered. The conditions as to food, water, and means of transportation were shown to have greatly influenced the condition and direction of the migrations. A brief review was given of the numerous stocks of Indians in California and attention called to the similarity as to the prevalence of numerous tribes in the Mexican gulf area studied by Dr. J. R. Swanton. The Pacific coast was described as a vast ethnic enclave, a veritable swarming place of tribes, whose origin, antecedents, and development in most instances perplex</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON 145 the ethnologist. California presents a most interesting field of study to anthropologists. Californian historians are alive to the value of these studies as a groundwork for history, and the speaker mentioned the work of H. H. Bancroft, Charles F. Lummis, Robert E. Cowan, and others who have contributed valuable work. Progress in museum display of anthropological material was noted and the great collections in San Francisco and Los Angeles described. The speaker found evidence of the increasing growth of civic pride in sustain- ing the work and adding to the effectiveness of museums. It was said also that the University of California is a force for anthropological science in California, and the intelligent patronage of Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst in this direction was praised since she had made possible the important researches of Dr. A. L. Kroeber and others and the enriching of a great museum through exploration. An account was given of the work in the more than 400 shell mounds of San Francisco bay carried on by E. W. Gifford, N. C. Nelson, and T. T. Waterman, and of the explorations among the Indian tribes. The two great expositions which California has successfully carried on this year are of great import to anthropology, especially that at San Diego, where this subject was preeminent, the San Francisco Ex- position being mainly devoted to modern progress. This anthropological exhibit of the former, which was prepared by Prof. W. H. Holmes, Dr. Ales" Hrdli'ka and others of the United States National Museum in co- operation with Dr. E. L. Hewett, has never been excelled, and it will be a permanent contribution to California. The speaker said, in closing, that there is being built up on the West Coast a people of general culture who are appreciative and receptive of the researches of science. It augurs well for the science of anthropology here that it has an alert public which aids in the extension of its activities-a public that demands and can assimilate its results. Meeting of December 7, 1915 AT the 491st meeting of the Society, held in the Public Library, December 7, 1915, Mr. Francis LaFlesche, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, read a paper on the "Right and Left in Osage Rites." The Osage, at the formative period of their tribal organization, had arrived at the idea that all life proceeded from the united fructifying powers of two great forces, namely, the sky and the earth. They also perceived in these two forces an inseparable unity by which was made possible the continuity of the life proceeding from them. It was upon these con- IO</page><page sequence="6">146 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 18, I916 ceptions that they founded their complex gentile organization. They first divided the people into two great divisions, one of which they called "Tsi-zhu" (household), symbolically representing the sky, and the other, "Hon-ga" (sacred), representing the earth. These two great symbolic divisions they brought together to form one body which they likened to a living man. He stood facing the east, the left side of his body, the Tsi-zhu division, being to the north, and the right side of his body, the Hon-ga, being to the south. When a war party including men of both the great tribal divisions was being organized, the people pulled down their wigwams and reset them in a ceremonial order, which was in two squares with a dividing avenue running east and west. In this arrangement the position of the symbolic man was changed so that he faced the west; consequently the right side of his body, the Hon-ga division, was at the north, and the Tsi- zhu division, at the south. All the ceremonial movements were made in reference to the right and left side of the symbolic man, as was also the placing of the symbolic articles used in the ceremonies. The portable shrine has a right and a left side. When the ceremonies of the tribal war rites were being performed, the shrine was put in its place so that the left was toward the Tsi-zhu and the right toward the Hon-ga. When a man was initiated into the mysteries of the war rites, the shrine of his gens was temporarily transferred to his keeping. If he belonged to the Ho"-ga division he hung the sacred article at the right side of his door when viewed from within; if he belonged to the Tsi-zhu division, he hung it at the left of his door. A woman for whom a sacred burden-strap had been ceremonially made, hung the sacred article at the right side of her door if she belonged to the Hon-ga division, at the left side if she belonged to the Tsi-zhu division. The observance of right and left pertained to many details connected with the tribal ceremonies and appeared in the daily customs of the people. The paper was discussed by Miss Alice C. Fletcher and Messrs. Hodge, Swanton, Fewkes, Mooney, and Michelson, among others. Similar dualistic concepts regarding right and left or earth and sky as determining social relationships and fundamental modes of conduct were reported as found in widely separated tribes, such as the Hopi of the South- west and the Piegan of the north. The discussion centered largely upon the significance of 7 and 6 as sacred numbers, which are found widely spread in ancient and oriental nations as well as in America. Several members referred the origin of 6 as a sacred or occult number to the six "cardinal points," north, south, east, west, up, and down. The number</page><page sequence="7">ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON 147 7 adds to these the concept of the center between the points. Dr. Fewkes referred at length to his earlier studies of the preference given the left hand in the sacred mysteries of the Zufii and what he has called the "sinistral circuit," which was followed, for instance, in Zufii processions and by anyone approaching the kiva. Some theories account for this significance of the left side by being the side where lies the heart and the side which supports the shield in battle. Miss Fletcher dwelt upon the intellectual and especially the poetic and anthropomorphic character of these concepts of the Indian thinker who faces nature in the open and feels impelled to think out and give reasons for things. Is not the sky side, the left, in the Osage conception given the place of honor because of a deep feeling of its religious significance? DANIEL FOLKMAR, Secretary</page></plain_text>
