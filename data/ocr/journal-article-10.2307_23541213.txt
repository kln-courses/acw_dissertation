<plain_text><page sequence="1">15 Ritual and cult in Crete and Cyprus from the third millennium to the first millennium bc: towards a comparative framework Anna Lucia D'Agata and Antoine Herniary Ritual and cult in Crete and Cyprus from the third millennium to the first millennium bc: towards a comparative framework Anna Lucia D'Agata and Antoine Herniary Thanks to the exceptionally large amount of data being amassed and elaborated by modern archaeological research, the reconstruction of the cult activities and relevant ritual practices in the Aegean during the Bronze Age virtually amounts to a discipline in its own right. For while the lack of contemporary written sources makes it impossible for us ever to achieve a comprehensive knowledge of religion in the pre classical Greek world, whenever religious practices involved the use of special objects or venues, they can be identified through archaeology and contribute to a reconstruction of the ritual element and how this had come to be formulated. The context of cult activities reveals clearly the profound differences that existed in the history of Crete and Cyprus between the 3rd and the 1st millennia BC. While we have a remarkable quantity of evidence relating to such activities in Crete, we have practically none for Cyprus in the EBA and MBA, apart from uncertain patterns of behaviour of a religious or potentially religious nature. This sharp distinction is mirrored in the different socio-political developments that occurred in the two islands over the same period. While a unified culture was shared on Crete at least from the EBA, and the emergence of complex societies was a truly precocious phenomenon, the social fragmentation of the earliest phases of the Bronze Age, the radical changes in the LBA and the formation of kingdoms in the 1st millennium emerge as watersheds in the development of prehistoric Cyprus. Given these marked differences, the following analyses are naturally quite distinct: the first presents an overview of cult activities on Crete from the 3rd to the beginning of the 1 st millennium BC, emphasising above all the transformations that took place over this lengthy period; the second looks at the problem of continuity in cult practices on Cyprus spanning the very end of the 2nd millennium and the 1st millennium BC. CULT ACTIVITY IN CRETE FROM THE THIRD MILLENNIUM TO THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BC Anna Lucia D'Agata In Crete religious rites and beliefs, probably harking back to mythological cycles, represented the framework and at the same time the essence of the shared values and social and political structure of the groups living on the island from at least the MBA onwards. In this period the religious domain should not be seen as separate from what can be reconstructed of day to day life, just as no clear distinction can be made between the sacred and profane spheres. Ritual practices and religious symbolism were a fundamental means of promoting and maintaining the predominant ideology for the elites which succeeded one another in power in the main sites of the island. In view of the diversity of religious practices in Crete in the Bronze Age, the summary that follows makes no claim to being comprehensive: it merely seeks to highlight some of the formative processes, chief phenomena and trends. In considering this reconstruction three basic points must always be borne in mind: that Crete was characterised by a unified, shared culture at least from the EBA onwards; that the emergence of complex forms of society was truly precocious; and that in the island's history the marked continuity in culture and settlements makes it difficult to identify any authentic cultural watersheds.1 Just to give some examples: the depopulation of Laconia at the end of the Bronze Age, the profound cultural changes that took place in central Anatolia on the fall of the Hittite empire, and the Celtic invasion of central Anatolia in the 3rd century bc.</page><page sequence="2">274 ANNA LUCIA D 'AGATA AND ANTOINE HERMARY Obviously the question of continuity is highly significant. The persistence for centuries in the same location of settlements and places of burial and the adoption of communal rites imply the strength of the collective nature of social organisation in Bronze Age Crete. The sense of community was so strong in Crete that even for the Protopalatial-Neopalatial period there is no clear archaeological evidence suggesting the emerging of individual identities, just as there are no elements pointing to forms of kingship.2 In seeking to identify practices which were crucial to Cretan society at least from the EBA, we can mention ceremonies of a collective nature involving the sharing of food and/or drink, sometimes with a huge participation. The MM IB Early Magazine A is the oldest deposit to store equipment for use in ceremonies discovered in the Palace of Knossos.3 More commonly, however, it was the careful interment of materials and objects used in collective ceremonies that resulted in structured deposits which we can identify from archaeological investigation. The careful burial of objects used during a specific ceremony documents the precise will in one segment of the community to leave a trace of the event and hence to make political capital out of its memory.4 The oldest structured deposit in the Palace at Knossos is the Vat Room Deposit,5 which dates back to MM IB. It marks the first evidence on the site for what we can refer to as the will to exploit the past through the sacralisation of specific events. In Crete this practice remained a fundamental tool in the exploitation of power at least until the PG period, as the ritual pits of Thronos-Kephala testify.6 Significantly, the Vat Room Deposit is located in the same area as what was later to be known as the Central Palace Sanctuary, the most sacred area of the Palace of Knossos. However, the oldest examples of structured deposits relating to collective ceremonies have been identified in the settlements of Knossos and Ayia Triada and date to the EM period.7 They have been interpreted as the remains of ceremonies which sanctioned the exceptional, and hence perhaps sacred, nature of the site in which they took place, creating a myth-event and giving rise to a derivative ritual which in practice legitimised the supremacy of a specific group in the respective community. At another level of interpretation, during the 2nd millennium BC the identity of a collective ritual/religious phenomenon appears to have been closely associated with the formation and emergence of differences and disparities of a social nature. BEFORE THE PALACES In the period immediately before the formation of the palaces (EM III-MM IA) there was a sudden acceleration in religious activity on Crete involving two main focal points, the peak sanctuaries and ritual areas in proximity of tombs. At the end of the 3rd millennium the peak sanctuaries constituted what has been defined as a ritual response to the landscape on the part of the rural population of peasants, farmers and shepherds.8 They formed a system of cult places which were similar in terms of topographic location and lack of architectural structures, but differed from one another in the inner arrangement of the sacred areas and the character of the ceremonies held. In view of the large number of figurines found in all the peak sanctuaries, it is obvious that these sites had a religious function. Communal ceremonies including the preparation and consumption of food, rites of a rural nature and pilgrimages to the sites all seem to have become established components of the ritual activities. In addition to the ritual actions performed here, the presence of offerings, usually modest, suggesting a contact with the divinity in a particularly striking natural environment, and the preparation of food and drink for communal consumption figure as recurrent elements. The other pole of cult activity on Crete prior to the creation of the palaces is represented by paved areas and annexe chambers built in the vicinity of the circular tombs of Mesara and by the open areas outside some distinctive tombs in eastern Crete.9 At the very end of the Prepalatial period, in contrast with the exclusive nature of the ritual performed within the tombs,10 some of these monuments became centres for a ritual activity of a communal nature based mainly on the manipu lation of liquids, such as libations and drinking.11 A striking case is that of Ayia Triada, where Tholos A was brought back into use.12 On a terrace to the south of the tomb, an area has been located marked by baetyls where the remains of a ritual activity, characterised by the consumption of food and drink of various kinds, has been reconstructed on the evidence of a vast, chronologically homogeneous MM IA ceramic complex.13 The phenomenon of ritual activities performed in the vicinity of tombs can be accounted for as showing local elites legitimising their claims to power by manipulating the rituals carried out at the 2 The aspect of kingship remained a rather elusive matter on Crete up until LMII—III, when the Palace of Knossos acquired a throne room, contra Driessen and Langohr 2007. 3 Macdonald and Knappett 2007. 4 Connerton 1989. 5 Panagiotaki 1999. 6 D'Agata 2000. 7 Day and Wilson 2000; Wilson and Day 2002; Todaro 2003. 8 Peatfield 1983, 1990, 1992, 1994. 9 Cf.

The same sort of interest in the surrounding territory and in its past has been reconstructed for an entire site, that of Knossos, in the Prepalatial period, when the site may have represented a place of cult practice and belief closely linked to a 'perception of the landscape as an area of action and memory.'14 A very different picture emerges in the case of Cyprus. In the long phase preceding the formation of political entities on a regional basis — in the course, that is, of the EBA and MBA — almost no shrines were to be seen, no community areas reserved for a ritual activity, nor any evidence of cult, even within the domestic environment. Ritual — and not necessarily cult — activity seems to have been mostly confined to the necropoleis.15 Here mortuary practice was an ideology emphasising the veneration of ancestors, and mortuary rituals were public events essential to create or renew prestige, public display and competition. Funerary feasts, however, seem to have had elite connotations, and were apparently celebrated to magnify the membership of the deceased in the exclusive group that was buried in that tomb. In other words, both the characteristics of the mortuary practices and the absence of communal rites (i.e. rites in which the active participation of a large quantity of people was expected), suggest that the community dimension so evident on Crete was not present on Cyprus. At a different level of analysis, the peak sanctuaries and paved areas in the vicinity of the tholos tombs express a relationship with the landscape that was to remain characteristic of Crete throughout the Bronze Age and indeed well beyond. In the broken topography of Crete, peak sanctuaries and cult places located in natural environments such as caves, rock shelters or springs give expression and are functional to the creation of sacred landscapes. They document one of the basic characteristics of the geography of religion which is typical of Crete: perception of the landscape as a single entity, with no artificial separation between urban and rural areas, a vision that lasted, with some fluctuations, till the end of the Bronze Age. On Cyprus by contrast, in the course of the Bronze Age no cult place appears to have been located wholly in nature, and 'all the excavated cult places appear to have been established to meet the needs of a complex urban and regional infrastructure and to have been closely linked with human exploitation of the landscape.'16 Just as it is rare to find structures devoted exclusively to cult use, so evidence of cult activity including iconic representations associated with the divine sphere remains ambiguous for most of the Bronze Age. The portable figurines from the EBA Age of the type commonly found on Crete and Cyprus and in the Cyclades and the Near East may have had symbolic and/ or apotropaic value, and did not necessarily represent votaries or divinities.17 As Peatfield remarked, of the thousands of figurines found in the peak sanctuaries in almost a century of archaeological exploration, not a single fragment has been identified as a deity image.18 Similarly, the cult activity performed in the vicinity of the tombs does not involve anthropomorphic figures which can be clearly identified as divinities. The only representation in a settlement environment that may have a sacred significance is the famous vase in the form of a female figure found at Myrtos-Fournou Korifi,19 but the representation here is ambiguous: it is indeed a vase and at the same time it is a figure, and it belongs to a category of vases of the sort documented in a funerary context.20 THE PROTOPALATIAL PHASE The appearance of the palaces, or monumental buildings with a central court, on Crete at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC is an unmistakable sign of the island's entry into the international circuit of the 'high cultures' that had developed in the Near East. The great wave of innovation that accompanied their advent had two main effects in the religious sphere. On the one hand, it involved the transfer of collective rituals, based on the communal consumption of food and drink, and on ritual interments, inside the palaces, with the explicit purpose of integrating forms of religious practice already established in the surrounding territory. On the other hand, in the context of a social strategy designed to reinforce the power of the dominant groups, it led to the creation of a palace religion. This received a decisive impulse from the importation of objects, ideas, beliefs and symbols from the Near East. The elites involved in this process were seeking 'to claim affinity with distant elites and represent themselves at a local level as qualitatively different beings'.21 From now onwards, and up to the end of the Bronze Age, the groups that controlled the palace system worked to achieve a progressive concentration of the exploitation of sacrality as a means of exercising social control. Thus the areas used for ritual activities close to the tombs quickly fell into disuse,22 and the communal rites 14 Day and Wilson 2002, 161. 15 Keswani 2004. 16 Webb 1999, 294. 17 On their meanings, see Sherratt 2000; see also the results of the excavations at the site of Dhaskalio Kavos (Keros), interestingly defined as a symbolic central place of the EBA, in Renfrew et al. 2007. 18 Peatfield 2001, 53. 19 Warren 1972, 209, fig. 92, pi. 70. 20 Gesell 1985, 7; Cadogan 2010; Driessen 2010. 21 Schoep 2006, 56. 22 One of the last examples of this phenomenon could be seen in the tomb of Chrysolakkos, with its monumental façade and the adjacent paved area: Soles 1992, 166-71.</page><page sequence="4">276 ANNA LUCIA D 'AGATA AND ANTOINE HERMARY that had taken place there, and were in fact quite similar to those performed in the peak sanctuaries, were transferred to the western courtyards of the palaces, where triangular shaped paved areas were laid out with raised walkways, kouloures (large stone-lined pits) and altars; they may also have been given a specific décor, with flora and fauna recreating a natural setting. The rituals known to have taken place here included the preparation of food, communal meals, and conservation of all or part of the remains in a ritual pit. The kouloures, probably places to store grain, may well have been the focus for ceremonies associated with the harvest. The raised walkways within the paved courtyards may have served to guide the processional routes towards rural sanctuaries. The complex that gives the best idea of such a ritual is the so-called Upper West Court Sanctuary in the Palace of Phaistos.23 It has often been remarked that these rites were similar to those that took place in the peak sanctuaries,24 but it is important to be clear about the difference in the way the rites were performed and exploited. In the peak sanctuaries during the MM period there is nothing to rule out the possibility that the rites were conducted individually, while the rituals performed in the palaces were strictly the concern of a priestly caste which figured as the principal actors in the ceremonial, and came to use objects of great worth. Analogously, although there is likely to have been some public participation involving people from outside the palace, the absence of great quantities of clay figurines, invariably found in the peak sanctuaries from the same period, indicates that in the urban areas the populace did not take an active part in proceedings. In both the peak sanctuaries and the palace sanctuaries just referred to, the rites were similar and probably alluded to the same sequence of actions/events to be evoked, recalled or anticipated and placed under supernatural protection, but the way in which these rites were carried out appears, as we have tried to show, to have been quite different. In the context of collective rituals, then, we can point to the imitation or reproduction of a natural context,25 the presence of specialised personnel (priests) and the use of precious objects, as basic features of the new palace religious system. Not much can be said about which divinities were the object of this cult. In spite of the frequent reference to such natural phenomena as childbirth and crop fertility, and the likely concern with male initiation rites, the peak sanctuaries do not appear to have had strictly uniform ritual activities, as is borne out by an iconographical analysis of the offerings found there, and the same goes for the activity that took place inside the caves.26 There are in fact substantial local variants throughout the island. One unique case is the sanctuary of Symi, probably linked to male initiation rites, which came into being in MM IB as a regional sanctuary not pertaining to any specific settlement or palace site and which appears to have maintained its autonomy over several centuries. On a different level, in the area of the Central Palace Sanctuary in the Palace of Knossos, which was to emerge later as the main area linked to official cult, the MM IB Vat Room Deposit can be seen as one of the earliest features of the exclusive character of Minoan palace religion.27 It is the first evidence we have in Knossos of behaviour which, as we have said, appears typical of Cretan society at various levels in the Bronze Age: ritual burial designed to perpetuate, through the creation of a sanctified place, the memory of an event which was obviously held to be of particular significance. The inclusion in religious practices of elements from the Near East was meant to reinforce exclusive rites28 performed by specialised personnel. This is when we begin to find pillar crypts, in which the pillar appears to have had a ritual function, and may have been surrounded by juglets, denoting the libations that were made there; similarly the sunken rooms, that may be the fore-runners of the Neopalatial lustral basins, and new types of ritual vases, namely rhyta, which testify to the formalisation of the rituals that involved the manipulation of liquids; finally on the seals we find the symbol of the Egyptian Taweret in the form of the Minoan genius, also associated with the ritual manipulation of liquids, and a clear sign of the affinity between the supervision of the sacred and the administrative spheres. THE NEOPALATIAL PHASE The series of destructions which marked the end of MM II also represents the beginning of a new phase in the history of the Cretan palaces. This involved the grandiose, if problematic, reconstruction of the Palace of Knossos and an exponential growth in its authority, as well as a new organisation of the palace religious system in which monumentality and ostentation emerged as key elements.29 This new system developed during the MM IIIA, a period which yields the oldest lustral basin to be found inside a palace, at Galatas,30 the earliest palace iconography featuring the bull, 23 Pernier and Banti 1951, 572-81; Gesell 1985,120-4. On the possible presence of autonomous sanctuaries in Malia in MM II, see Poursat 2009. 24 Most recently by Briault (2007, 131-4). 25 Thus too Hitchcock 2007. 26 See Tyree 2001. 27 This structured deposit, constituting a specific precedent for the Temple Repositories, featured exotic and precious materials probably used in some cult activity that included a ceremony based on drinking: cf.

While peak sanctuaries went into decline and most disappeared, those on Juktas, Petsophas and Kophinas remained active in MM III. The fact that precious objects and inscriptions in Linear A are found there is a clear indication that as integration proceeded in the surrounding areas, the centre of power took care to extend its authority well beyond the confines of the Palace. On the road leading to Juktas, the building of Anemospilia, a structure whose function was not exclusively concerned with the cult, provides a good illustration of the passage from the Protopalatial peak sanctuaries to their Neopalatial counterparts, controlled by the political authorities.31 In fact Juktas can be seen as the definitive peak sanctuary, elevated to monu mental status by a large terraced area, an altar and an ancillary building standing close to the natural chasm in which the offerings were placed. The relationship between the Palace of Rnossos and the nearby peak sanctuary was probably regulated by a calendar of events and a procession linking the two sites. The rites that took place inside the palaces were more exclusive, mainly involving pillar crypts and lustral basins. No other Minoan complex has yielded up the quantity of precious objects concerning a ritual venue found in the Temple Repositories of the Central Palace Sanctuary at Knossos. These have recently been interpreted as the remains of a carefully planned ritual performed in the central courtyard involving intentional fragmentation and structured deposition.32 One of the main characteristics of the Neopalatial phase is the proliferation of cult symbols and the emphasis on cult activities discernible throughout the island. This emphasis has been attributed to an interest on the part of the Palace authorities in authentic forms of religious propaganda.33 The predominant symbols are female figures, double axes and horns of consecration. While the double axe seems in general to define areas in which religious activities were performed, the horns of consecration, often found close to a gateway, may also have been an allusion to a threshold or the passage into the sphere of the sacred. The importance of medium-sized horns of consecration made of stone or stucco as visible and tangible symbols, and their great popularity in LM I and above all LM IB, has often been remarked on.34 It cannot surely be a coincidence if the sites that have yielded horns of consecration correspond almost exactly to those where lustral basins have been found, namely the basement structures associated with ritual activities which were most prevalent in the Neopalatial phase.35 In view of their partially underground nature, the lustral basins have been associated with chthonic rituals and the emblematic descent into the earth and subsequent re emergence, and the presence of the horns of consecration — an object already connected with the Egyptian symbol for the horizon — could allude to the passage from one state to the other. The explosion of the volcano of Santorini left an indelible mark in the southern Aegean and seems to have had significant repercussions also in the religious sphere in north-central and eastern Crete.36 In the region that seems to have been affected by the eruption it is possible to distinguish two phases in the organisation of cult activities. The earlier phase ends with LM IA and seems to consist in the development of what can be referred to as Neopalatial religion in its purest state. The more recent phase, following on the eruption and thus identifiable with LM IB, sees the appearance, at least in eastern Crete, of new forms of worship associa ted with sanctuaries or community shrines that seem to have been accessible to the whole local community. The sanctuary discovered in Building 5 at Palaikastro is a clear example: the presence of an anthropomorphic statue, the famous chryselephantine kouros, featuring here possibly for the first time as the focal point for the activity that went on in the building, is a sign of an essential change with respect to the religious practices that had prevailed up until this time.37 A phenomenon that seems to have gained ground above all in the late Neopalatial phase is the use of caves for some form of sacred activity probably connected with the presence of chambers with stalagmites and their possible status as baetyls.38 The collection of chalices from the cave of Skoteino, consisting of about 500 fragmentary vases, provides excellent documentation for reconstructing the ceremonies based on drinking which must have been held here; and the presence on at least one of these chalices of an inscription in Linear A confirms the connection with the palatial administration.39 In the absence of contemporary written sources, the debate that has been going on for over a century concerning the nature of Minoan religion, and whether it was monotheistic, as Evans maintained, or polytheistic, as the tablets in Linear Β indicating the existence of various divinities in the Mycenaean pantheon would seem to suggest, remains unresolved.40 Recently attention has been paid to the experiential dimension of Minoan religion, meaning the way in which experience of the supernatural is dealt with by 31 On the possible strategic role played by the building, see Girella 2001. 32 Hatzaki 2009. 33 Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 59. 34 D'Agata 1992; Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 58. 35 Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 59-61 ; Adams 2007, 403-5. 36 In general, Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 54-61. 37 MacGillivray et al. 2000. 38 Tyree 2001. 39 Perna etal. 2005. 40 Cf. Goodison and Morris 1998.</page><page sequence="6">278 ANNA LUCIA D 'AGATA AND ANTOINE HERMARY individuals.41 One significant development has been the identification in Neopalatial iconography of 'a cluster of Minoan gestures which all revolve around a general pattern of arm bent at the elbow and raised in front of the body',42 and which culminate in the right hand to forehead gesture. The various gestures have been interpreted as expressions of increasing intensity to denote the interaction between the worshipper and the supernatural through the use of the body. No less significant is the observation that ecstatic scenes are only depicted on precious objects such as rings and sealstones worn in contact with the body. This fact points once again to the importance which direct contact with the supernatural, and the expression of control over ritual, had for the elites in Neopalatial times. THE FINAL PALATIAL AND POSTPALATIAL PHASES We can speak of a homogeneous Mycenaean culture existing on the Greek mainland from the 14th century BC, when Crete entered the continental cultural orbit. There is a notable discrepancy among scholars as to the reasons for this phenomenon: some attribute it to the arrival on the island of groups from the Argolid from LM II—III A1 who gained control over Knossos and the central area, while others see the island's rapid and profound transformation as reflecting the cultural growth achieved by local elites in imitation of the new centres of power on the continent.43 What seems reasonably certain is that between LM II and IIIA1 the Palace of Knossos exercised control over most of the island by means of a form of supra-regional territorial organisation. Thereafter, in LM IIIA2 and IIIB, the state of Knossos disintegrated and was supplanted by a series of small, politically independent territorial entities.44 With the end of the Neopalatial phase the complex religious and territorial organisation of the cult system put in place by the Cretan palaces was completely destroyed. The bureaucracy that had supervised the whole sacred sphere certainly disappeared, as did the cult apparatus and precious ritual objects, together with the associated representations of ritual performances. The change, in the religious and cultural spheres alike, was substantial, even though the Minoan past was heavily reused. As an indication of the scope of the transformation, we can recall that these were the centuries of the Bronze Age during which there is less evidence of community life on the island, and the social emphasis seems to be concentrated, for the first time, on individual activity. A clear sign of this is the appearance in the Palace of Knossos of a throne room, just as on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus we find a depiction of the funerary rites performed for an individual, which included the presentation of gifts, libations and the sacrifice of a bull.45 From LM IIIA2 the fall of Knossos and the definitive disappearance of the palaces also entailed an end to the practice of holding assemblies in central palace courtyards. At this time independent, small-sized buildings catering for worship were built in some urban centres.46 This radical change is difficult to explain except perhaps as the result of a marked political will to concentrate supervision of the ritual sphere. The possibility that at least some of the ceremonies were collective is indicated by the fact that some cult buildings, like the Sacello at AyiaTriada, gave onto open areas — in this case the Piazzale dei Sacelli.47 And it is perhaps now that clay female figures with upraised arms make their appearance, although they remain rare until the 12th century. For the first time it is possible to identify the figures of priests, who on Crete as on the mainland were buried with a set of libation vessels.48 To judge from the data that can be gleaned from the texts in Linear B, the religious activity of the elites seems to have had little impact in economic terms, although the texts do suggest that its cultural and political importance was maintained unaltered during this period.49 Outside the urban centres, however, we find evidence of some form of ritual activity in caves and cave shelters. Given the paucity of data available for these centuries it is difficult to point to definite trends and indeed to be sure of the existence of a territorial system under central control: Tyree states that inside the caves there is no trace of formal organisation or any purpose-built structures.50 The most frequently found vase is the kylix, at least in LMIIIB, which points to the existence of ceremonies based on drinking. THE EARLY IRON AGE After the collapse of the LBA state system, what emerges in the 12th century BC is a different scenario characterised by the breakdown of the traditional settlement pattern and a marked instability that includes both shifts of population from low-lying to défendable sites and the establishment of new sites. Starting from the second half of the 12th century BC a common system of cult becomes evident almost all over the island. The practically ubiquitous urban or settlement sanctuary is now the bench sanctuary, very often associated with ritual sets of cult objects including large clay female figures with upraised arms, stands 41 Morris 2001, 2004; Peatfield 2001; Morris and Peatfield 2002. 42 Morris 2001, 249. 43 In general, see Macdonald 2005, 135-231; Driessen and Langohr 2007. 44 Bennet 1985, 1990; Driessen 2001. 45 See recently Burke 2005. 46 Gesell 1985, 41-56; Peatfield 1994. 47 D'Agata 1999, 228-9; Cucuzza 2001, 172-3. 48 Koehl 2006, 337-42.

In Cyprus the use of urban sanctuaries and specialised cult centres probably dates back to the 14th century (LCIIA), but the sanctuaries datable to a phase corresponding to the 14th and 13th centuries are indeed few. It is from the 12th century that we have what has been described as an explosion of independent sanctuaries, regularly associated with urban political entities and characterised by monumentality and conspicuous display. The typological diversity of the sanctuaries reconstructed for Cyprus52 indicates that social complexity on the island during this phase may be compared with that reconstructed for Crete.53 Urban cult buildings and rural cult centres document the existence of sanctuaries which may be considered similar from a typological point of view, and seem to derive from comparable social demands. On Cyprus the urban cult places show a certain variety of features and display a markedly local character: for many of them close connection with the LC copper industry has been postulated. This being so, the cult characterisation of the landscape of Cyprus in the LBA appears to have been closely connected with the island's metal resources. By contrast, the proliferation of sanctuaries at Enkomi suggests that multiple elite groups may have been in control of different ranges of production activities, and also that ritual activity in the Sanctuaries of the Horned God and Double Goddess was limited to a few. On Crete the urban cult buildings also show significant differences implying among other things different organisation at the social political and possibly ethnic level.54 We have identified: - settlements, like the one at Karphi, where the large numbers of sanctuaries in relation to the size of the exposed area may be explained as due to the absence of a central authority and to the competition among groups unable to monopolise the local resources; - settlements like those at Vronda, where the existence of a central authority is suggested by presence of a single cult building accompanied by a main 'secular' building; - the temple complex at Vasiliki-Kephala which could document a third different case of socio political integration: its scale, size and complexity probably included more than one cult and suggest the existence of a strong centralised local authority which monopolised essential ritual activities in a territory probably larger than the settlement. Thus the Cretan and Cypriot communities at the end of the LBA cannot have been so very different in terms of composition and social organisation. However, over and above the appreciable differences to be seen between the urban sanctuaries of the two islands at the level of architecture, cult objects and associations of cult objects, three particular points of distinction are worth stressing: the homogeneity of the cult assemblage of the sanctuaries of the goddess with upraised arms on Crete attests to a large sharing of religious beliefs which is apparently unknown on Cyprus; the close connection observed in the case of Cyprus between cult activity and activities of an industrial nature, having to do with the exploitation of raw materials, to all appearances is unknown on Crete; the recurrent presence in the LBA Cypriot sanctuaries of exotic material finds practically no correspondence on Crete, attesting to different social strategies and, probably, greater social competition within the Cypriot communities in this phase. A different type of cult place fairly common on Crete in LM IIIC is the open air sanctuary,55 which has a long history on the island. The cults performed in the open air cannot be associated with a single class of sanctuaries, but rather the sanctuaries may be grouped on the basis of the level of integration they show with the socio-political system they belonged to. Re-established on an important Bronze Age site thenceforth reserved exclusively for use as a sanctuary, the open air shrine on the Piazzale dei Sacelli at Ayia Triada56 was located in the most important part of the site which, at least as from LM I, had been the traditional centre of social, political and religious power in the settlement. The cult place at AyiaTriada may be interpre ted as expressing the control exercised over the territory by the ruling power settled at Phaistos.57 In the case of the sanctuary at Symi, the emphasis on ritual consump tion of drinking and/or food suggests interpretation of the cult place as a rural cult centre, which acted mainly as a regional meeting point and was probably established on the basis of peer polity interaction. Small-scale rural shrines, set up in natural locations and probably detached from any level of social organisation, may constitute a third type of open air sanctuary. The cult offerings in the cave of Psychro on the northern slopes of the Dikti massif included mostly personal objects, such as fibulae, pins and rings, or razors, spearheads and knives. Considering that the organisation of the sacred area shows little structuring, and that virtually all the offerings were by individuals, these must have been personal dedications, and the cult was hardly likely to have been organised by a local central authority.

Between the 10th and the 9th centuries, above all in the eastern and central regions of the island, we see a reshaping of the settlement pattern, with a dispersal of settlements and the definitive emergence of a number of settlements that were to become the centres of new territorial units, later the microstates of the Early Archaic period. The political landscape of Crete in the early 10th century BC has by and large yet to be defined in detail, but it seems significant that this phenomenon of restructuring also corresponds to the disappearance of the urban bench sanctuary and the ritual set that had gone with it since the early centuries of the Dark Ages. Temple A at Kommos, the important harbour site on the south coast of the island, seems to have come into use at the transition from SM to PG.59 Identified under the subsequent Temples Β and C, the building ( 1020 800 BC) was erected to exploit the norh wall of the Minoan palatial BuildingT in the 11th century BC. There are no cult precedents for the building in the area, and the excavators associate the choice of the site with the possibility of reusing the ashlar masonry of the Minoan age. No figurines were found on the area of the floor where excavations were possible. A second phase in the building's use, dating from the early 9th century,60 is indicated by a new floor in beaten earth. A bronze figurine of a man has been attributed to the second phase of Temple A:61 it is worth recalling that the epigraphic evidence of the later sanctuary of Kommos indicates Zeus and Athena as the dedicatees of the local cult.62 The reuse of Minoan ruins for cult purposes seems to have been an extensive phenomenon in Crete and can be seen to persist without interruption at least down to the 8 th century. This kind of reuse began in the 12th century with the open air sanctuary that occupies the Piazzale dei Sacelli at Ayia Triada. The same sort of reoccupation for cult purposes was to follow shortly at Kommos, and subsequently it became a major pattern of cult behaviour of the Cretan communities.63 In the case of Cyprus the phenomenon has found little attention, but I should like to recall the cult reuse of the area of the Ingot God sanctuary of Enkomi and of the areas of the temples of Kition at the beginning of the 11th century.64 In both cases the new cult installation occupies the ruins of an earlier cult area. At Enkomi a marked change in the nature of worship is attested by the appearance of small terracotta figurines and larger wheel made terracotta votives, including the fantastic two-headed animals known as centaurs.65 What appears to be attested here is a case much like that which occurred 100 years before with the installation of the open air sanctuary of Ayia Triada in the most important spot on the site. Thus a similar social strategy was adopted at a distance of about a century by the newly founded communities of Phaistos and Salamis in the reuse respectively of the abandoned settlements of Ayia Triada and Enkomi. New cult practices of a communal nature that had developed about the need to legitimise occupation of the land through cultic reuse of the past are, therefore, to be seen as founding elements common to the advent of the Iron Age on the two islands — first on Crete, and subsequently on Cyprus. LES CULTES À CHYPRE, DU BRONZE RÉCENT AU 1ER MILLÉNAIRE: PERMANENCE DES SANCTUAIRES ET NOUVEAUX «LIEUX DE MÉMOIRE» Antoine Herniary La question de la continuité du culte dans un même lieu entre la fin du Ile millénaire et les premiers siècles du suivant est, à Chypre comme ailleurs, particulièrement délicate. Les deux principaux exemples connus, celui de la Grande Déesse à Palaepaphos et du dieu masculin d'Ayia Irini, ne sont pas totalement probants, car dans le premier cas la fréquentation du sanctuaire n'est pas vraiment assurée entre la fin de l'Âge du Bronze et le CG III — même si les structures monumentales sont restées visibles66 — et les trois siècles couverts par le CG I et II constituent aussi, à Ayia Irini, une période relativement obscure.67 Le cas de Kition est particulièrement intéressant, grâce aux résultats des fouilles du Département des Antiquités à Kathari et à celles de la Maison de l'Orient de Lyon à Bamboula. Le grand lieu de culte du Bronze Récent à Kathari paraît cesser d'être fréquenté pendant environ deux siècles, de la fin du Xle à la fin du IXe siècle,68 alors que les recherches françaises à Bamboula ont confirmé — mais à partir de vestiges très modestes — l'existence d'un habitat du Xe siècle av. J.-C.69 Elles ont en même temps montré que les pratiques cultuelles 58 Cf.

The cult was thus poor and on a small scale during this period' (SCEII, 817). 68 On dispose maintenant de l'ensemble de la publication des fouilles de V Karageorghis: Karageorghis and Demas 1985; Karageorghis 1999, 2003, 2005. 69 Yon 2006, 55, fig. 29; 77, fig. 42a.</page><page sequence="9">RITUAL AND CULT: TOWARDS A COMPARATIVE FRAMEWORK 281 en l'honneur d'une divinité féminine n'étaient attestées qu'à partir du CG III,70 c'est-à-dire très peu de temps avant que le sanctuaire de Kathari soit réoccupé et bientôt entièrement reconstruit. Une autre question largement débattue est celle du transfert de cultes d'un site de l'Âge du Bronze récent vers un nouvel établissement de l'Âge du Fer. L'exemple privilégié est celui d'Enkomi et Salamine: le grand dieu masculin de la ville fondée au Xle siècle, connu plus tard sous le nom de Zeus, avait-il un antécédent direct à Enkomi, où il est évoqué, entre autres, sous la forme «dieu cornu» et du «dieu au lingot»?71 Il est impossible de le dire, mais il n'est pas facile non plus d'établir avec précision la continuité du culte du «Zeus» salaminien entre le CG I et le CA I,72 en partie à cause de l'inter ruption brutale des fouilles sur ce site en 1974. Ici comme ailleurs à Chypre, on se heurte au problème de définition de la période CG II, datée traditionnellement d'environ 950-850, et plus particulièrement à celui du principal «marqueur» religieux de cette époque, les figurines en terre cuite: bien attestées en contexte de sanctuaire dans la première partie du CG I, ces offrandes semblent pratiquement disparaître pendant plus d'un siècle pour réapparaître à la fin du CG II ou au début du CG III sous une forme souvent très proche de celle qu'elles avaient au CG I.73 Cette problématique rejoint celle — si importante pour l'histoire de Chypre — du lien entre le développement des royaumes et celui de leurs principaux sanctuaires. Cette fois, Amathonte et Kourion peuvent servir d'exemples privilégiés. Les fouilles de l'École française d'Athènes sur le premier site ont montré que le sanctuaire de la Grande Déesse locale, «l'Aphrodite de Chypre», n'était pas antérieur au CA I,74 alors que la première occupation à l'emplacement du palais archaïque et classique remontait au CG II ou III.75 Il en va de même à Kourion — où ne connaît pas actuellement d'édifice de type palatial — pour le sanctuaire du grand dieu masculin («Apollon Hylatès»), dont la fondation est datée approximativement à la transition entre le CG III et le CA I, donc vers 750.76 À partir de cette date, sur ces deux sites comme partout ailleurs dans l'île, les lieux de culte connaissent une remarquable extension, dans les villes et sur leurs territoires, sans rupture de continuité entre le CA I et la fin des royaumes, souvent même jusqu'à l'époque impériale. Un phénomène peu étudié jusqu'à maintenant à Chypre est celui de l'introduction de nouvelles pratiques cultuelles, à partir de l'époque chypro archaïque, sur des sites abandonnés depuis le Bronze Récent. Cette fréquentation religieuse ne se caractérise pas par des constructions plus ou moins monumentales, mais par le dépôt d'offrandes figurées, sculptures en calcaire et figurines en terre cuite. Cette nouvelle démarche cultuelle est très clairement attestée à Enkomi, Maroni et Sinda, mais elle ne se présente pas de la même façon sur les trois sites.77 À Enkomi, les premières découvertes ont eu lieu lors des fouilles britanniques de la fin du XIXe siècle, dans les tombes 16, 17 et 33 (fig. 15.1). Il s'agit de fragments de sculptures en calcaire et de figurines en terre cuite dont le nombre exact n'est pas possible à établir, ni la situation précise dans les tombes, sauf pour une grande tête en calcaire trouvée dans le dromos de la T. 16.78 Le fait qu'ils soient tous très fragmentaires indique, en tout cas, que ces objets ne sont pas des offrandes directement liées aux tombes du Bronze Récent. Le caractère insolite de la découverte a pu faire penser que ces œuvres provenaient originellement de Salamine et non d'Enkomi,79 mais les indications données par les fouilleurs anglais et la mise au jour d'autres figurines dans les fouilles de Dikaios ne permettent pas de retenir cette hypothèse. On est frappé par les dimensions et la qualité de plusieurs de ces fragments, qu'il s'agisse de la tête féminine en calcaire C263 ou d'éléments de statues féminines en terre cuite qui appartenaient eux aussi à des œuvres de taille naturelle, voire légèrement plus grandes:80 ces œuvres sont comparables aux meilleures productions de Salamine, Arsos ou Idalion pour la phase ancienne du CAII (environ la première moitié du Vie siècle). L'objet le plus spectaculaire, dont les deux fragments trouvés dans la T. 16 n'ont pas été conservés, était cependant un grand vase en calcaire portant un décor de palmettes (fig. 15.2):81 il rappelle, à une échelle inférieure, le célèbre «vase d'Amathonte» qui était placé au sommet de l'acropole du site, dans le sanctuaire d'Aphrodite.82 Les restes de ces offrandes en pierre et en terre cuite indiquent donc la présence, à proximité immédiate, 70 Calvet 2002. 71 Courtois and Lagarce 1986, 16-18, 32-7; Webb 1999, 91-113. 72 Yon 1980. 73 Karageorghis 1993a. 74 Fourrier and Herniary 2006. 75 Alpe et al. 2007. 76 Buitron-Oliver 1996, 14, 65. 77 Ces trois exemples pourraient être complétés par ceux de Myrtou-Pighades, Phlamoudhi-Vounari et Kourion Bamboula, où 'there is a gap from the end of the Bronze Age to Archaic times, when a few figurines of the fore-type were dedicated' (Young and Young 1955, 224). 78 Tatton-Brown 2000, 18, fig. 1 (British Museum C263: H. 32 cm).

Ce témoignage doit être complété par les nombreuses figurines en terre cuite mises au jour dans «l'area III» des fouilles de P. Dikaios: un premier groupe, dans la zone de la tour Nord-Est de la fortification de l'Âge du Bronze, est constitué de figurines géométriques associées à de la céramique White Painted I,83 alors qu'un deuxième groupe, composé de figurines et de tessons archaïques, provient de la zone Nord-Ouest.84 Il est très vraisemblable que les figurines archaïques, toutes féminines, proviennent du même lieu de culte que les objets trouvés dans les fouilles anglaises et que l'ensemble a été dispersé à une date qui doit se situer vers la fin de l'époque chypro-archaïque, mais il n'est pas possible d'établir une continuité entre les offrandes du début du CG et celles du CA II. Il est difficile de déterminer l'emplacement de ce lieu de culte, consacré probablement à la Grande Déesse de l'île, mais, plutôt qu'à la «tour» de la porte Nord,85 comme l'avait envisagé H. Catling, on penserait à la zone d'où proviennent les plus grands fragments trouvés dans les fouilles anglaises (fig. 15.3). Quoi qu'il en soit, ce sanctuaire doit être considéré comme un élément important de la politique religieuse du royaume de Salamine au temps du roi Evelthon et de ses prédécesseurs immédiats, associant un établissement de l'époque héroïque à la dynastie au pouvoir. Au cours du colloque Vassos Karageorghis a suggéré que les figurines en terre cuite et les sculptures mises au jour dans le remblai du «tumulus 77»,86 situé juste à l'Est du village moderne d'Enkomi, pourraient provenir aussi d'un sanctuaire situé dans la ville du Bronze Récent, voire du même lieu de culte. Même si l'éloignement topographique (le tumulus se trouve à plus d'un kilomètre du site d'Enkomi), le décalage chronologique entre ces sculptures et celles découvertes dans le fouilles anglaises, ainsi que la différence dans le type des terres cuites, rendent cette relation très hypothétique, il paraît certain que les statues et figurines accumulées à la fin du IVe siècle au-dessus du «bûcher de Nicocréon» provenaient d'un sanctuaire proche d'Enkomi, probablement de Yalsos («bois sacré») mentionné dans un inscription sur un col d'amphore trouvé dans ce même remblai.87 Notons que, parmi les objets mis au jour à cet endroit, se trouvait une figurine représentant un personnage cornu, rappelant peut-être l'ancien dieu d'Enkomi.88 Quel qu'ait été son emplacement et la divinité à laquelle il était consacré, ce sanctuaire témoigne que la région de l'antique Enkomi est restée, à l'époque classique et jusqu'à la chute du royaume de Salamine, un lieu symboliquement important. C'est aussi, très vraisemblablement, au royaume de Salamine qu'appartenait le site de Sinda où avait été construite au Bronze Récent une petite ville fortifiée. Grâce à la récente publication des fouilles suédoises,89 on sait qu'environ 140 fragments de sculptures en calcaire et figurines en terre cuite ont été trouvés dans un remblai du «Gate Area», constitué vers le début de l'époque hellénistique. Ces fragments, qui datent de la fin de l'époque archaïque et de l'époque classique, appartiennent très majoritairement à des personnages masculins, indiquant le sexe de la divinité auquel le lieu était principalement consacré à l'emplacement des ruines anciennes.90 Comme celui ou ceux d'Enkomi, le sanctuaire date donc visiblement de l'époque des royaumes, tandis que d'autres documents — malheureusement sans contexte archéologique — se rapportent à des cultes d'époque hellénistique, comme une statuette fragmentaire de Cybèle91 ou une statue d'Artémis92 que l'on rapprochera d'une inscription mentionnant le «thiase d'Artémis des habitants de Soandos»,93 très vraisemblablement le nom de Sinda à cette époque. La petite ville hellénistique était située à un autre endroit que celle du Bronze Récent, mais on ignore tout de son histoire. J'ajoute cependant qu'une grande tête féminine coiffée d'un calathos, conservée au Louvre, est dite aussi provenir de Sinda:94 elle pourrait indiquer qu'un culte féminin avait été établi là dans la première moitié du Ve siècle. Avec Maroni on passe dans le royaume d'Amathonte. Des découvertes éparses faites avant 1980 aux lieux dits Tsaroukkas et Vournes montraient que le site de l'Âge du Bronze avait été très partiellement réoccupé à l'Âge du Fer, et des fragments de statuettes indiquaient l'existence d'un ou plusieurs lieux de culte. Jane Johnson en a fait l'inventaire,95 moins significatif pour Tsaroukkas, où elle mentionne essentiellement un fragment de statuette en calcaire datant peut-être de la fin de l'époque classique,96 que pour Vournes, où H. B. Walters signalait déjà, en 1897, «some common Cypriote statuettes of limestone (of later date)»,97 et où 83 Dikaios 1969, 220. 84 Dikaios 1969, 302-3, pl. 107: 35^13; Hadjicosti 1989. 85 Catling 1975, mais d'après Webb (1999, 146-8), il s'agit vraiment d'une tour, non d'un sanctuaire. 86 Karageorghis 1974, 191-3, pis. 156, 171-2. 87 Karageorghis 1974,144,pis. 168,286:108; alsoMasson 1974. 88 Karageorghis 1974, 139, pl. 166: 10. 89 Furumark and Adelman 2003. 90 Furumark and Adelman 2003, 119-25, pis. 40-3. 91 Nicolaou 1979, 175-6, pl. 27:11.

Les fouilles de Gerald Cadogan à Vournes ont amplement confirmé ces indications. En attendant la publication détaillée de ce matériel, que prépare Anja Ulbrich, je rappelle qu'au sommet de la colline se trouvait un petit sanctuaire, apparemment en fonction du CAII au début de l'époque hellénistique, dans lequel avaient été déposées des figurines en terre cuite et de petites sculptures en calcaire, de type masculin (fig. 15.4) et féminin.99 Une structure interprétée d'abord comme «child's grave or cenotaph» (fig. 15.5) n'est probablement pas une tombe ancienne réoccupée à des fins cultuelles, comme on en connaît un exemple dans le sanctuaire d'Aphrodite à Amathonte,100 mais une sorte de petit autel creux (ieschara):101 les cruchons qui y avaient été déposés montrent en tout cas que ces pratiques religieuses remontent à la première phase du CA. Si la continuité des pratiques cultuelles, dans certains sanctuaires de Chypre, entre l'Âge du Bronze et le Chypro-Archaïque n'est pas exclue, mais reste difficile à établir, il apparaît qu'au cours de l'époque chypro archaïque des lieux de culte ont été créés à l'emplacement de sites du Bronze Récent considérés comme les témoins d'un passé prestigieux. Ce phénomène n'est pas du même ordre que celui que l'on observe en Grèce, à la fin de l'époque géométrique et durant le haut-archaïsme, en liaison avec des tombes d'époque mycénienne, car, malgré les découvertes des fouilles anglaises d'Enkomi, les offrandes ne sont pas directement liées aux sépultures anciennes. On comparera plutôt les cultes, le plus souvent féminins, établis à l'emplacement des palais de l'Âge du Bronze, comme à Mycènes ou Tirynthe, mais dans ces quelques exemples grecs les manifestations religieuses vont de pair avec une réoccupation plus large du site. La Crète, qui est dans ce colloque le point de comparaison essentiel, n'a pas fait connaître de démarches religieuses vraiment similaires. Le cas chypriote est donc particulier, il est lié selon toute vraisemblance au développement des royaumes à l'époque chypro-archaïque et à la volonté des principaux souverains, ceux de Salamine et d'Amathonte en particulier, de souligner l'ancienneté et l'importance de l'occupation de leurs territoires, en les rattachant peut-être à des récits légendaires, en tout cas en sacralisant ces sites et en en faisant des «lieux de mémoire». Ceux-ci perdent l'essentiel de leur sens et disparaissent, semble-t-il, après la chute des royaumes de l'île, à la fin du IVe siècle. 98 Johnson 1980, 39, pl. 58: 306 (H. 8.7 cm).
