<plain_text><page sequence="1">Will, Freedom &amp; Power. By ANTHONY KENNY. (Oxford: Basil Blackwell. 1975. i'p. 170. Price ?6.00.) In this book Kenny "extends and modifies" the theory of action and volition pre- sented in his Action, Emotion and Will, and applies his conclusions to elucidating the nature of freedom and its relation to determinism. His central theme, he tells us, is that the human will is the ability to act for reasons, and that its freedom derives from the special characteristics of practical reasoning. In this review I shall be rather critical of some aspects of his defence of t, his central theme, but I would not like to give the impression that I did not find this book uniformly interesting and stimulating, or that there is not a lot in it which seemed to be entirely correct. Kenny appears to equate the human will with that of a language-user, and to hold that it, is clearly distinct from that of any "dumb animal". Such animals do, he says, have desires, thoughts and concepts, and act for the sake of ends. We can, moreover, without anthropomorphism, use concepts beyond their reach in order to specify their thoughts and wants--we can say that a dog thinks there is a bone buried beneath a bush without attributing to it any knowledge of anatomy. Nevertheless, he believes, animals cannot act for reasons, and, since to act with an intention is to act for a reason, they cannot act with an intention. Thus Kenny stands between the hard liners, like</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 89 Davidtson, who deny not only reason and intention but also thoughts and concepts to animals, and those who feel that practical reason and intention are not incompatible with absence of linguistic ability. This seems to me to be an uncomfortable position, and Kenny's defence of it not very plausible. Unfortunately he does not consider any of the more impressive and interesting examples of animal behaviour, nor does he discuss any features of such examples which have led psychologists to speak of flexi- bility and insight. Much less does he attempt to imagine how a being without language might, in principle, be able to act. One sort of flexibility occurs when, failing to attain its end by one means, an animal tries other ways until it is successful. Kenny himself says that "trying to (p, it seems, is doing something with the intention of (ing" (p. 129), but seems ready to admit that animals can try (p. 48). He also insists that the actual behaviour of an animal is the result of desire and belief, while denying, even when the end is remote and the means complex, that its beliefs may constitute its reasons. But this is precisely where we do attribute practical reason to human beings even though they have not engaged in any explicit train of argument. His only positive reason for distinguishing language-users in this way is that language is necessary for self-con- sciousness. This is a plausible enough claim, though one would like to see it given a better backing than the familiar "it is hard to see" how a "dumb animal" can think that he is thinking that p, or think that he wants that p. But why is it supposed to follow that an animal cannot act for a reason? If an animal can think that p without knowing that it thinks that p, and want to (p without knowing that it wants to (p, why cannot it act for a reason without knowing that it acts for a reason? Davidson, equally stuangely, gives this sort of justification for denying that an animal can even have a belief. According to Kenny an animal can "manifest" a desire, but cannot "express" that it is (ping because it has a desire. Only in a fairly strong sense of 'express' is the second half of this claim true, and in that sense it seems doubtful if an animal can ex- press a desire either, and even more doubtful if it can express a thought. Possibly Kenny's urge to deny practical reason and intention to animals arises from the thought that animals are not rational beings. But should one equate rationality with the mere ability to act for a reason? We do not call a language-user rational, as opposed to irrational, unless he is also capable of being reasoned with, of being made to see that his reasons may not be as good as he thought. Maybe an animal only gives up acting as if his desire to (p were his reason for ying when ying fails to deliver the goods. But even that seems enough, in some cases, to allow one to say that it acts for a reason. Having failed in its intention to get the fruit (lying outside the cage) first by hand and then by using the short stick nearby, the animal may finally pile up the boxes in order to reach the longer stick which is suspended out of reach, and use that to attain its end. Moreover, although the dumb animal cannot be told that the short stick is of no use, there seems to be no a priori reason why it should not realize this for itself before trying and failing. Why should it not pick up the short stick, move towards the bars of the cage, and then abandon it in favour of the longer one before actually puttting it through the bars? It may well be that the human will is the ability to act for reasons of which the agent is, or canz become, consciots. But Kenny, as far as I can see, gives no reason for equating that ability with the ability to act for reasons, or for denying the latter ability to any being which lacks language. According to Kenny human freedom is freedom from psychological determinism. Such freedom, he holds, exists and is compatible with the conjunction of the physio- logical determinism of our bodily movements and the "translatability" of physiologically- based predictions of our bodily movements into the language of human behaviour. As far as 1 can see Kenny is agnostic about the reality of either part of this conjunction. At the core of his thesis are two arguments to the effect that beliefs and wants are not determining causes of intentional action, though they may be determining causes of an action which is not intentional. According to the first argument a determining cause</page><page sequence="3">90 BOOK REVIEWS requires laws of tendency which are never fulfilled by what actually happens. It is, he says, impossible to find psychological laws of this kind covering intentional action because, when practical reasoning is successful, all the agent's wants (tendencies) are satisfied (fulfilled). This argument is suggestive and interesting, but tantalizingly in- complete. It raises a host of doubts and questions, of which there is space here to men- tion but one. Whether dumb animals engage in practical reasoning or not, do their wants always lack fulfilment, as by parity of reasoning they should, since those wants are, according to Kenny, determining causes? The second argument is crucially depen- dent upon an account of 'A pd because he wanted to'. On that account it means that A's ying was not predictable from external circumstances alone, as would be the case if A was physically constrained. This surely will not do. If external circumstances do not include the agent's physiological state, then the most unwelcome and uncontrollable sneeze would be done because the sneezer wanted to. If, on the other hand, physiology is included, then, assuming physiological determinism and "translatability", all a man's actions will be in principle predictable from external circumstances alone, and human freedom will turn out not to be compatible with physiological determinism after all. It seems to me that Kenny's discussion of psychological determinism suffers badly from an inadequate account of what a determining cause is supposed to be. He gestures towards Hume and Mill, but there is no mention of any more recent and better account, within that tradition, of the notion of causality (e.g., that of J. L. Mackie). J. M.
