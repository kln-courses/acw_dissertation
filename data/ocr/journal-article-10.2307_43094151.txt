<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODELS FOR TECHNICAL COMMUNICATORS John Colby, Editor Readers are invited to share with their colleagues a brief but signifi- cant philosophical statement or an outstanding example of crafts- manship that they have used as a guide, consolation, or inspiration in their work as technical communicators. The specimen should be accompanied by an explanation of why it has proved valuable, along with a short biographical sketch of its author. Manuscripts should be sent to John Colby, Rt. 1, Box 43, Spieewood TX 78669. Figures of Speech Metaphor, simile, and analogy have long done much to enliven prose and are, of course, the very stuff of poetry and song. But they are tricky things indeed in the hands of the technical writer. Let us look first at two useful examples, then at one that indicates how an author can get carried away on a sea of metaphor. Example 1 is an apt analogy. Written for a lay audience, it graphically describes what happens to rock formations on the flanks of a salt dome. Textbooks devote many pages and illustrations to scientific dissertations on the subject without ever giving the feeling that Clark and Halbouty create. Of course, the analogy has shortcomings. The glass analogy is a two-dimensional description of a three-dimen- sional event, and real-life salt domes uplift over geologic time, not suddenly. Still, I doubt that anyone could come closer to the essence in fewer words. Example 2 shows how to use simile accurately. Viscosity and centipoises have little or no meaning for those not educated in the science of fluids. Even when we think we understand these words we would be hard put to define them. In this particular case, we were writing a bulletin for management, and we wanted to convey a feel for the fluid without being technically inaccurate. So we measured the viscosity of some common substances and found that may- onnaise was the closest. This suggests that we can be quite accurate in the use of simile ... just take the time and trouble to measure the pertinent properties of some homely materials, or look them up in a handbook. Example 3 is a gem. The author uses excited , emitting , and circling quite properly, but he overreaches when he gets to settles happily. He commits the crime of anthropomorph- ism, which in Georgia is almost as bad as committing nepotism with one's niece. James A. Clark lived and worked in southeast Texas for many years, producing numerous nonfiction books and articles. Michel T. Halbouty is an eminent geologist and a prolific writer of technical articles and papers. He has discovered and produced great quantities of oil and natural gas, and he should probably be designated a natural re- source in these energy-short times. John Colby and Joseph A. Rice have written one book and numerous articles on technical writing and teaching. They are active members of STr John Colby Example 1 : a description of subsurface formations around a salt dome To prove his point and his theory he once compared a salt dome's flanks to a shattered glass. Pointing to the plate glass top of his great desk, Yount explained, "If I should hit that glass with a hammer hard enough to crack it all over, you would have my idea of what a salt dome's flank is like. The center, of course, would be the salt plug, and the cracks radiating out in all directions would represent the flank area. The strata of the surrounding area have been shattered by the rising of the salt. Anywhere, in any direction, oil might be located. The irregularity of the breakage accounts for oil being found in certain places, and being drained off under a tract a few feet away." - from Spindletop , by James A. Clark and Michel T. Halbouty, Random House, N.Y., 1952 Example 2: a description of a special well-treating fluid The . . . fluid, at room temperature, has a viscosity of 350 centipoises, or about that of mayonnaise. - from Writing to Express , by John Colby and Joseph A. Rice, Burgess Pub. Co., Minneapolis, 1977 (paper- back) Example 3: an ill-fated attempt to explain unstable isotopes An excited electron leaps from one orbit to another, emit- ting little bundles of energy. Like a world circling a sun at closer range, the electron settles happily into a new path. - from an in-house technical writing manual 64 Technical Communication, Third Quarter 1981</page></plain_text>
