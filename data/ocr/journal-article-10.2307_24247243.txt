<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alexander Regier. Fracture and Fragmentation in British Romanticism. Cam bridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 256. $89. Perhaps because of the inherent self-reflexivity of the subject, or perhaps because of the anxiety about its definition, studies on the Romantic frag ment seem to provoke two very different critical impulses. The first aims at a kind of scientific clarity, classifying particular types of fragment poems ac cording to familiar likeness, degree of completion, or some other category. The other impulse, best realized in Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue Labarthe's still-influential The Literary Absolute, allows the study to mirror its object, offering a kind of elliptical and fragmented criticism that ac knowledges its own self-reflexivity but revels in the impossibility of escap ing it. One sees both impulses in Alexander Regier's Fracture and Fragmenta tion in British Romanticism, despite an attempt to negotiate a critical stance of studious neutrality. SiR, 51 (Winter 2012)</page><page sequence="2">628 BOOK REVIEWS "Fragmentation is central to Romanticism," Regier states, and it's difficult to imagine anyone disputing this, despite disagreement on why or how (3). However, Regier means his thesis be taken literally—that is, the process of fragmentation is not only central to Romanticism, but Romantic "fantasies of wholeness that turn out to be broken in their origin or hide a fracture at their centre" (25). His analysis is distinguished by an attempt to shift attention from the question of fragment genres to fragmentation as a process, "a notion whose multifacetedness and intricacy enable conceptual and textual analysis not normally thought of in relation to brokenness" (25). These titular terms, Regier hopes, will "require of us a certain atten tiveness that reminds us how each fracture, textual or phenomenological, demands scrutiny in its relation to a larger structure" (25). On one hand, this is an extremely practical move, since it allows him to sidestep the usual argumentative abyss of defining exactly what a fragment is—a form? a genre? a continuum?—and call our attention to its conceptual significance, within the context of Romanticism and beyond. On the other hand, in re placing generic boundaries, however much in question, with more abstract terms, the book sacrifices some cohesiveness, and as a result is (intention ally?) riven by swerves in argument and topic; its chapters feel largely like separate fragments, rather than interlocking pieces or building blocks. Regier deliberately chooses material outside the traditional purview of Romantic fragments, and readers expecting new insights into "Kubla Khan" and "Hyperion" will be surprised by an eclectic set of subjects that includes the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Wordsworth's parentheses, Keats's letters, and De Quincey's citations. Also surprising to some readers will be the fluid way Regier moves between the Romantic period and the twenti eth century, and between philosophical and literary discourses; though only one chapter is explicitly comparative, much of the argument gains momen tum through comparison rather than analysis. A first chapter on the echoes, or harmonies, of the Babel story in Wordsworth and Walter Benjamin, serves as an introduction to this method. The parallels Regier draws come primarily from Benjamin's 1916 essay "On Language as Such and the Lan guage of Man," which claims, perhaps Romantically, that "all nature would begin to lament if language was conferred upon it" (32). Regier nicely pairs Benjamin's expansion of this statement with passages from The Ruined Cottage, turning our attention to the way both texts conceive nature as a place where a pre-Babelian language might still exist (though it would be impossible to describe it in our limited post-Babelian means of expres sion). Later, he uses this intersection to examine how Benjamin's claim that "in all mourning there is a drive toward silence" might be usefully applied to Wordsworth's attempts "to surpass linguistic confusion in a meaningful silence" in The Prelude and Essays upon Epitaphs (41). While such a compar</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 629 ative or sequential style of criticism reading is unexpectedly productive, its freeness contrasts with Regier's deliberate close-reading of Wordsworth, which can feel plodding at times. In his second chapter, which functions as a kind of alternative introduc tion, Regier focuses on the eighteenth-century "problem" of anthropo morphism, though less is said about the Romantic solution than one might expect. Guiding the reader through a many-sided discussion that includes Rousseau, Herder and Hamann, James Beattie, James Harris and Lord Kames, Regier illustrates how figurative language—and anthropomorphic language in particular—became conjoined with the large questions of di vinity and knowledge, and the eighteenth-century search for the origins of language. Roughly, the debate is between those who argue for the earlier existence of a kind of non-figurative language, and those who argue that figuration and anthropomorphism are original and intrinsic to all language. What the two sides agree on, however, is the figurative and anthropomor phic drive in poetry, which Regier characterizes as a "Romantic longing of merging with an anthropomorphized nature" (72). Of course, this charac terization implies its own impasse: no poet gets beyond "anthropo morphized nature" to the real thing, since "nature" has from the beginning been imagined in human—that is, figurative—language. For Regier, this paradox can be seen as another example of a fractured origin, though his description of this circularity is itself a bit circuitous: The ultimate conclusion must be that this fundamental break, the fragmenting quality of the origin, is also a 'natural' one. This gives new impetus to the assertion that the division between nature and the trope (a trope that simultaneously sets us apart from it and wants to unite us with it) is located at the origin of language. Accordingly, lan guage already contains this fundamental break within itself. The frac turing anthropomorphism is a 'natural' one in the sense that it pertains to the character and nature of language. By the same token, one can describe the divide that resides within the coining into being of lan guage as 'natural' or adequate to it. And what would be better to rep resent this dynamic than the rhetorical figure that always captures this fracture—anthropomorphism. (73) Though the first two chapters take fracture as a figurative term, the bulk of the book is about breakages evident to the eye: earthquakes, parentheses, citations, and Keats's letters (though the last is more fragmentation than fracture). In a series of well-argued if somewhat predetermined case studies, Regier construes each as a simultaneous moment of origin and fracture. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755, presented as a key event in the discourse of the Romantic sublime, offers him a chance to ground the book's thesis</page><page sequence="4">630 BOOK REVIEWS in a seismic fracture that was observed by both Burke and Kant, whom readers may be surprised to learn wrote an urban planning treatise called History and Natural Description of the Remarkable Occurrences of the Earthquake, which at the End of the 1755th Year shook a Large Part of the Earth. Regier shows how Kant's attention to the disaster informed the definition of the sublime in Critique of Judgment, which describes the mind as trembling or vibrating [Erschutterung], suggesting the Kantian "secular sublime" is under written by a "darker dynamic" that "discloses a disruptive and breaking quality at its core" (94). Similarly, in an analysis of parenthesis in The Pre lude, he finds that "the Wordsworthian sublime, seemingly so distant from anything parenthetical, carries a disruptive bracketing at its centre" (113). In both cases, his conclusions remind us of the difficulty—familiar in stud ies of the fragment—of successfully negotiating between literal and figurai senses of the term. In other words, is the fractured nature of self and time in these sections of The Prelude actually caused by parenthetical breaks in the text? Or do we read them as such only because of the poem's other (figurative) fractures of narration and time? In chapters on Keats's letters and De Quincey's citationality, this tension is less apparent, perhaps because fragmentation has long been a part of these authors' critical traditions. In both cases, Regier examines the way that a self-conscious process of fragmentation was instrumental in establishing a literary legacy. For Keats, Regier argues, invoking theories of gift exchange and economy, the letters demonstrate "a fragmentary principle around which his posthumous corpus is constructed" (119), a principle culminating in the unopened letter in his tomb, a symbol of the "fragmented text . . . part of the incomplete assemblage of memorabilia that is responsible for his representation as a Romantic poet" (132). In his study of De Quincey, Regier follows Blanchot and others in observing that the very act of cita tion is a fracturing force, breaking both the original text into a fragment and introducing a disruptive outside voice into the new text. Through the lens of citation and its analogous acts of recollection and reference, Regier examines how De Quincey, Romanticism's early archivist, established an archive that valued the fragment above the whole. A wonderful example is De Quincey's description of Essay on Man by Alexander Pope, which transforms the Augustan into a Jena Romantic: "the majority of the pas sages have a mode of truth; not of truth central and coherent, but of truth angular and splintered" (153). Despite De Quincey's opposition of these terms, Regier brings them together: the splintered truths of Romanticism are also its central ones. Regier admits the familiarity of this conclusion, as well as the tendency, expected by now, of theories of linguistic fracture to turn upon themselves. One cannot fault the book for a lack of self-awareness of its own weak</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 631 nesses, but at times Regier seems overly obliged to critique his argument, pointing out the obviousness of claims that may not appear obvious to the reader. It's an environment where only the mildest claims survive: in his conclusion, Regier timidly hopes that his book "provides us with a hint for understanding better why we assumed the inquiry was rewarding in the first place," though even this comes with a warning "not to overestimate our results" (186).
