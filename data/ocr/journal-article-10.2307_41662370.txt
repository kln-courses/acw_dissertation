They were one of many American "nations" of high culture known to us only by their archaeological re- mains. For their civilization, which flourished more than a millennium ago, probably eighth and ninth centuries A. D., lacked any system of writing, and practically no memory of them remained in the traditions that were written down by the Spanish chroniclers of the time of Pizarro. Their extraordinary pottery was for- merly known as "Proto-Chimu," for they were succeeded by the more flourishing but less ar- tistic Chimu "kingdom" which was in turn conquered by the imperialistic Inca from the Peruvian highlands a few. decades before the time of Columbus, only to be overwhelmed sixty years later by the Spanish. The coast of Peru is a succession of widely separated small river valleys which were in- tensively cultivated; in each lived a people with its own peculiar manufactures and style of art which differed not only from valley to valley but from period to period. Between the valleys are absolute deserts in which the people made their cemeteries; irrigable land was too valuable for that purpose. As it almost never rains in this region, and as the graves were deeply dug, the "burial furni- ture" has been wonderfully preserved, comparable to that of Egypt, even to the marvelous textiles, for an- cient Peru was possibly the center of the world's most developed textile industry, as far as variety and perfec- tion of technique are concerned. This is more true of the more arid southern portion of the Peru coast; in the Mochica-Chimu region the rainfall was heavy enough so that few textiles have been preserved. The Mochica, in any case, were among the world's great pictorial ceramists. Their ornate vessels, appar- ently made only for burial with the dead or for other ceremonial uses, are exquisite examples of modeling. Little more than a study of these is needed to get a good picture of the life of the people. For they show, in most naturalistic form, almost every conceivable human activity, as well as houses, boats, animals, food plants and a host of other objects. Although they were apparently made in molds, duplicates are almost un- known. In addition to the modeled figures, lively scenes are often painted on the vessels. The present example shows a man with a bird face, obviously an owl, the Owl God having apparently been an important anthropomorphic deity among the Mo- chica. He is seated on a raft, probably of balsa wood, which is further supported by floats, most likely of gourds. He holds a war mace with a stone head, and a square shield. Four swimmers, their naturalistic heads in high relief, tow the raft by means of ropes. Each swimmer is supported by three "water wings," also probably made of gourds. On the lower part of the vessel are painted many other denizens of the sea, among which can be recognized crabs, a lobster or shrimp, and numerous fish. The fish are of several species, their special characteristics exaggerated ; to ichthyologists their identification should be rather easy. This interesting vessel, the gift of Mrs. George W. Childs Drexel, is in the University Museum, Philadel- phia. - J. Alden Mason Summer 1950 95</page></plain_text>
