The hypothesis that predators induce stability in prey populations is discussed. The experimental results indicate the importance of preferential feeding to this question. Models of selective feeding based on short-term changes in hunger and situation may be inappropriate when applied to cold-blooded predators. An alternative interpretation, based on learning and hunting behavior, is given for the changes in selectivity observed in these experiments. INTRODUCTION Predation is usually selective in some sense: given a variety of potential prey, the pressure will be greater on certain age groups or species. The basis of this selectivity may be behavioral. In- vestigation of the behavioral aspects of predation, emphasizing the factors that affect the performance of individual predators, is relatively recent in this country. This approach stands apart from ecology in the strict sense, but its subject matter is rele- vant because conceptual models in population ecol- ogy often involve specific assumptions about the way predators act. Sometimes certain behavioral features are explicitly assumed, but more often they are taken for granted (e.g. "random" search- ing by the predator, identity of behavior and dis- tribution of alternative prey). When the main interest is in other parameters of a model, sim- plifying assumptions such as these may be useful. But because behavior seems to be an important part of predator-prey interactions, it is essential to know to what extent and under what circum- stances the assumptions are likely to be violated, how often this may happen, and most important, how sensitive a model may be with regard to im- plicit assumptions about predatory behavior. Two aspects of predatory behavior that are of special interest are selectivity and intensity of feeding. The experiments reported in this paper deal with selectivity of feeding in starfish. Feeding is selective when the items in the diet comprise a statistically nonrandom sample of those available. Many subtle factors may be important; even identification of the phenomenon is neces- sarily subjective, because the investigator almost certainly assesses "availability" of alternatives in a different way from that used by a predator. This makes it hard to be sure that one is dealing with a nontrivial case of selective feeding. But any ap- parent departure from random feeding poses in- teresting questions regarding both its nature and its significance to the organisms involved. Espe- cially relevant is its bearing on questions of be- havioral (and hence ecological) plasticity. The following experiments describe a number of features of selective feeding by starfish. The first experiment deals with selectivity for size of prey by predators of different size. The next experi- ment describes selectivity for different species of prey in a simple situation; the remaining series of experiments investigate the ways in which changes in various ecological factors may alter the direction and strength of preferential feeding. This information should precede speculation as to a plausible rationale for selective feeding. MATERIALS AND METHODS The two kinds of starfish used in these experi- ments were Pisaster giganteus and Pisaster ochra- ceus. In nature they feed on a wide variety of animals, mainly mollusks. When they occur to- gether, which is seldom, they appear to eat the same kinds of food. Several features of these starfish make them suitable for experimental work in the laboratory. They and their prey are easily accessible. They feed readily in the laboratory. Using mollusks as food, one encounters no problem in deciding when a prey organism has been eaten because starfish leave a completely empty shell and traces of mucus. Both the mollusks and the starfish can be kept in the laboratory for the length of an experiment with no apparent ill effects (less than 5% mor- tality of prey not due to predation). Moreover, the starfish are capable of rapid associative learn- ing (Landenberger 1966) and may therefore be expected to show interesting reactions to experi- mental manipulation of the conditions under which they feed. Starfish also have some disadvantages in experi- ments of this sort. The main one is their large size. Large aquaria are necessary; this makes extensive replication difficult. This restriction is the more serious because apparently similar indi- viduals vary a great deal in the amount of food they eat. (This is most evident at the beginning of an experiment; after a few weeks much of this variability disappears). Because of this problem of replication, it was necessary to choose between using a large number of aquaria of different sizes, which would permit running all treatments of an experiment at the same time, and using fewer but equal-sized aqua- ria, which would necessitate breaking up the ex- periments and running different treatments at different times. The second alternative seemed better because it seemed that the geometry of the aquaria might be the more important source of variability (this preconception has not been tested). Aquaria in Experiment 1 were .91m by</page><page sequence="3">1064 DONALD E. LANDENBERGER Ecology, Vol. 49, No. 6 .61m by .30m and in later experiments they were .91m by .46m by .30m. They were covered by mesh screens which fit tightly within the inner margin of the aquaria below water level. These prevented escape of starfish and snails. The aquaria were not artificially aerated but a con- tinuous supply of fresh sea water evidentally in- sured sufficient oxygenation and removal of meta- bolic wastes. The starfish used in these experiments came from Ellwood Pier, 16 km west of Santa Barbara, California. This is a region of protected outer coast; the starfish are mainly subtidal in this habi- tat. They feed mainly on mussels (Mytilus cali- fornianus) and to a lesser extent, on barnacles (Balanus glandula) and rock oysters (Chama sp.). The prey came from a number of rocky beaches in the same area. Any starfish was used only once, in one replication of an experiment; also, replicates and controls always involved dif- ferent individual starfish. Experiment 1. Selectivity for size of prey. Predators often select the size of prey they eat. This behavior can have important effects on the age structure and spatial distribution of a prey population. The following experiment was de- signed to determine the nature of such selectivity in starfish. The prey were two species of inter- tidal mussels, Mytilus edulis and Mytilus cali- fornianus. In each treatment 12 mussels were provided in five sizes ranging from 3.5cm to 10.5cm (see Table 1). This array of mussels has TABLE 1. Array of mussels presented in experiment I. Size classes 3.0-4.5 4.5-6.0 6.0-7. 5' 7.5-9.0 9.O-1O.5 No. in each class 3 5 2 1 1 a mean of 5.7cm and standard deviation of 1.77cm, and is representative of the size distribution of mussels available in the habitat from which the starfish were collected. Six sizes of starfish were used; the range was from 6.5cm average radius to 26.5cm average radius in increments of 4cm. This design was then duplicated to include both species of starfish. Thus, the fully crossed three- way design (2spp prey X 6 sizes predators X 2spp predators) involved two sets of 12 separate treatments. Because of lack of space it was neces- sary to run 12 randomly assigned treatments at one period and the remaining 12 at another; these were run 2 weeks apart. During this time the water temperature varied between 170 and 19'C. Three starfish were in each tank. Every 12 hr all mussels were removed and replaced by fresh TABLE 2.

The starfish were allowed to eat for 10 days in the first period and 12 days in the second period. The analysis compares species of mussels, species of starfish, and sizes of starfish in terms of the mean size of mussels eaten. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 2, and the data are plotted in Figure 1. In all cases, the average size of mussels taken did not differ significantly from the average size of those offered (Dunnet's test against the con- trol) but the analysis does show that large star- fish tended to eat large mussels. This is consistent for both species of starfish and both species of mussels. With respect to selectivity for size, there appears to be no differences between the species of mussels as prey or the species of starfish as predators. The variability in the individual ar- rays of mussels eaten by each group of starfish is not shown in the graph, but it is large: all sizes and both species of starfish ate all sizes of mussels. The results of the experiment indicated that the</page><page sequence="4">Autumn 1968 PISASTER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 1065 TABLE 3. The seven species of prey used in experiments on selectivity.

Therefore, in subsequent experiments these factors were controlled as closely as possible. Experiment 2A. Selectivity for different species of prey when presented in pairs. In a number of other experiments involving both species of mussels together in the same tank, a slight preference for Mytilus edulis was observed. This preference (the term is used here in a strictly operational sense) was not statistically significant in any one series of trials, but showed strongly when all the data from many individual starfish were grouped together. The figures from these experiments are not presented here; it is sufficient to report that the preference was in the same direction for both species of starfish (but seemed much stronger in the case of P. ochraceus) and that there was no apparent heterogeneity among sizes of starfish of either species. The mussels are rather similar in morphology; although M. edulis have thinner shells and smaller adductors, they may have a lower bodv weight than M. californianus of the same size (Harger 1967). Also, in the laboratory there is no apparent differ- ence in the rates of feeding on either species of mussel when presented alone (Landenberger, MS in preparation). In other words, the preference seemed to involve an active choice of Ml. edulis, and seemed also to lack any obvious functional justification. It was puzzling that a preference could exist between two such similar prey, with no obvious gain to the predator in eating the pre- ferred form. This suggested that before analyzing the factors that influence food preferences, it would be desirable first to get a broad view cf the kinds of preferences that are found over a range of dif- ferent sorts of alternative prey. The prey were three kinds of mussels, three kinds of snails, and a small chiton. All are com- mon in the rocky intertidal and all are eaten by starfish in nature. The three snails show avoid- ance reactions to both species of starfish. A brief description is supplied in Table 3; more informa- tion about these animals is in Ricketts and Calvin (1939). From here on, common names will be used. Regressions of dry weight on body length were obtained for each of these species so as to be able to use, as prey, individuals of similar size which also provided about the same amount of meat (0.5- 1.0 g) to the starfish. Collecting problems limited control over this factor; however, choices were made such that both the body weights and linear dimensions of the individuals of all species were fairly closely matched. This meant (for example) using smaller mussels and larger spiny whelks than could be conveniently collected. The ranges of body lengths and biomass of the mnollusks are shown in Table 3. In the first experiment the species of prey were presented in pairs (C7, 2 21 possible pairs). Equal numbers of both species (six and six for mussel vs. mussel, 10 and 10 for all other pairs) were placed in aquaria with screened tops, along with individual starfish. The starfish fed continut- ously; each day the aquarium tanks were checked, dead prey were counted and replaced by fresh prey. Thus, the ratios were kept fairly constant during the feeding period. This introduces an element of nonindependence into the design; all prey should be replaced. It was impossible to do this, however. The experiments ran for 2-3 weeks, depending on the number of prey eaten. The snail-mussel treatments were replicated three times, the others four times. Different individual starfish made up each replicate. Chi-square tests were used to assess selectivity and heterogeneity among the replicates in each comparison. No sig- nificant heterogeneity in selectivity among repli- cates appeared in any comparison, so the data were pooled for all comparisons. The results were quite simple: P. giganteus showed significant (P &lt; .05) preferences in all pairings save one (turban snail :spiny whelk) whereas P. ochraceus showed significant prefer- ences in all pairings save one (spiny whelk: clil-</page><page sequence="5">1066 DONALD E. LANDENBERGER Ecology, Vol. 49, No. 6 ton). The rank order of preferences for P. gi- ganteus was bay mussel &gt; California mussel &gt; ribbed mussel &gt; dog whelk &gt; spiny whelk, tur- ban snail &gt; chiton. For P. ochraceus the pattern was the same, excepting that the spiny whelk and chiton were in the last place, with no significant difference between them. The transitive property of the ranking was in- teresting in view of the fact that comparisons among pairs of prey were independent. This order and consistency suggests that, although dif- ferent factors may influence the direction of pref- erences in different comparisons, nevertheless their effect may be additive throughout the hierarchy. The similarity between P. ochraceus and P. gigan- teus suggests that at least part of the basis for the selectivity is common to both species; it may re- side in physiological or behavioral features shared by the starfish or, more likely, in the similarity of their responses to the other features of the experi- mental system (for example the geometry of the aquaria and distribution of prey organisms in them). Thus, the conclusions of this experiment are: ( 1) preferences between alternative prey exist and appear to be the rule rather than the exception; (2) the preferences can be ranked and form an orderly hierarchy; (3) the two species of starfish appear to be broadly similar in the se- lectivity they exhibit. Experiment 2B. Selectivity when all seven species of prey are present at the same time. In nature, it is usual that starfish have several alternative prey rather than two; it is of interest to know whether the results of the previous ex- periment can be generalized to this situation. The experimental setup used to test this was the same as in the previous experiment except that five individuals of each of the seven species of prey were present in each tank at once. Eight starfish (four individuals of each species) were used. One P. ochraceus died midway through the experiment and was replaced by another in- dividual. Data from the first individual were discarded. All eight aquaria were checked each day, dead prey being counted and replaced. The experiment ran for 5 weeks; once each week all prey were removed and fresh ones replaced. The data are daily counts of the number of prey of each species eaten by each starfish. One may first consider the way in which the general composition of the diet changed from the beginning of the experiment to the end. As usual, there was a great deal of varia- bility among individuals in the numbers of prey they ate. Therefore, if time were used as a scale, the comparisons among starfish at any point in time would involve different numbers of prey eaten at that time as well as different past his- tories. It seems reasonable to assume that star- fish gain experience with prey by eating them; any effect of experience should be related to the cumulative number of prey eaten. Therefore, in order to consider individual starfish at the same stage of experience, I divided the prey eaten by each individual into successive groups of roughly 30 prey per group (i.e. group 1 would comprise the first 30 prey eaten, group 2 the next 30 eaten, and so forth). It was not possible to assign ex- actly 30 prey to each group because the starfish eat several prey in one feeding period; the actual range was 23-43 with most groups having 29-35 prey per group. To estimate the diversity represented in these successive increments, I used the information sta- tistic H' (Brillouin 1%2), which is a function of the number of possible permutations in a set of discrete objects. For these data, if k species are represented in a group (N) of prey eaten, and ni 1.6 - -. 0..... \ 1.4 - k i ' _ H 1.2 - 1.0 A 1 2 3 4 5 6 1.6 1.4 H 1.2 \ 1.0 - B 1 2 3 4 5 6 Groups of 30 prey FIG. 2.

N (n!n!. .. nk!) This function is sensitive to departures from equal representation of individuals among the species. It is maximum (in this case about 1.7 for 28 prey individuals and seven prey species) at its expected value where all species are equally represented. The values of H' for each array of about 30 prey are plotted in Figures 2A and B. The lines joining the points identify individual starfish at successive level of experience. The total con- sumption of prey over the course of the experi- ment was quite variable: some starfish ate enough for five or more entries, others ate fewer. The connected points refer to the same indi- vidual starfish and are not independent of each other; thus, application of correlation or regres- sion analysis to these data is improper. However, a number of features are apparent without recourse 100 80 60 / 40 o . a) o ~~~A Cn (n M 1 2 3 4 5 E C 100 10o 0 0 ~~~~~~~~~~.01 . as 80 _ 0~~~~~~0 60 40 B l 2 3 4 5 Groups of 30 prey FIG. 3.

The relationship shown in Figure 2 may arise in many different ways. Figures 3A and B make use of the same data, but the ordinate shows the percentage of mussels (of all three species) in each group of 30 prey. Again the trend is clear: mus- sels, as a group, are taken with increasing fre- quency as the total cumulative intake increases. Moreover, although both kinds of starfish ate nearly 100% mussels by the end of the experi- ment, P. ochraceuts consumed a higher percentage of mussels from the start whereas P. giganteus began at a lower level. These observations would seem to account for the relationship shown in Figure 2, i.e., the increased consumption of mus- sels probably accounts for most of the increase in selectivity, and the higher initial percentage in the diet of P. ochraceus seems to account for some of the difference between the two starfish in the early part of the experiment. As a next step, one can compare the rank order of preference shown in this experiment with that of the previous experiment in which only two spe- cies of prey were available. For this comparison it was necessary to pool the data over the entire experiment in order to get large enough numbers of snails to make the comparisons realistic. Even with pooling, it was impossible to make compari- sons for P. ochraceus, which concentrated so com- pletely on mussels that the numbers of other prey are so small as to be unsuitable for statistical pur- poses. Therefore, the following remarks pertain to P. giganteus only. TABLE 4. Rank orders of preference in two experiments (Pisaster giganteus) Choice between 2 spp. Bay mussel &gt; Cal. mussel &gt; Ribbed mussel &gt; Dog whelk &gt; (Spiny whelk, Turban snail) &gt; Chiton Choice among 7 spp., (Bay mussel, Cal. mussel) &gt; considered in pairs Ribbed mussel &gt; Dog whelk &gt; (Spiny whelk, Turban snail, Chiton) The rank orders that emerged from both ex- periments are shown in Table 4. In this experi- ment the overall pattern was preserved, but there were fewer significant preferences (again assessed by Chi-square tests) among prey species. The distinction between the two species of Mytilus mussels disappeared, as did the distinction among the snails and chiton. It is as if the starfish had shifted their criteria to higher categories (for ex-</page><page sequence="7">1068 DONALD E. LANDENBERGER Ecology, Vol. 49, No. 6 TABLE 5.

Where sig- nificant preferences did occur, the preference seemed weaker; in the case of the Mytilus species vs. the ribbed mussel, the raw data show clearly that the distinction was made in the latter part of the experiment when the mussels were being taken almost exclusively. To document these impressions I estimated the strengths of preferences by means of the Chi- square contingency coefficient (this has the dis- advantage of being insensitive, but for compara- tive purposes it is sufficient). When the strengths of preference are arrayed as in Table 5, in most pairings the preferences are weaker in the second experiment (upper entry) where seven prey were present simultaneously. This pattern is signifi- cant (Friedman-Wallis two-way analysis of vari- ance, P &lt; .01). It is interesting that something similar seems to occur in humans, who can group sensory stimuli into about seven categories at most. Miller (1956), in a most entertaining and interesting essay, has discussed this phenomenon and gives several examples of its occurrence in psychological studies. The results of this experiment may be summa- rized as follows: (1) Selectivity of feeding in- creased with experience; this was largely a con- sequence of increased attention to mussels. (2) There were fewer significant preferences, and these were weaker, when many alternatives were present than when few were present. Thus the distinc- tions made seemed to be broader when a wide selection of prey was available. However, the pattern of rank order was the same in both cases. Hunting behavior and selectivity An interesting feature of these experiments was the way in which the composition of the diet ap- peared to be associated with the hunting behavior of the starfish. In experiment 2B, very early in the experiment the predators were moving mainly on the sides and top screens of their aquaria, but this soon changed to almost exclusive searching on the bottom of the aquarium. This corre- sponded to the differences in distributions of the prey species (snails on the tops and sides of the aquaria and mussels on the bottom). The in- creased consumption of mussels was associated with this change in searching behavior. Toward the end of the experiment I made several records of the location of each individual prey in each of the tanks. The pooled data (for tanks containing P. giganteus) are shown in Table 6. These fig- TABLE 6. Positions of prey in aquaria containing star- fish. Entries are relative frequencies (in per cent) of numbers observed. "Corners" include the top covers of tank.

If it is true that the starfish adjust their hunting behavior according to the location of a preferred prey, and take nonpreferred forms in proportion to the frequency with which they are encountered, then, in a multiple-prey situation, one need not invoke active selectivity among the non- preferred prey to explain their representation in the diet relative to each other. It would be inter- esting to know whether this may be true for other kinds of predators also. One feature of these experiments which may have induced attention to the bottom of the aqua- rium was the higher density of prey animals there (a minimum of 15 mussels in 1.37m2; a density of 10.9/M2) compared to the other parts of the tank (maximum of 20 individuals in 4.27m2; a density of 4.69/M2). To test whether the gross preference for mussels was based on density or position, as opposed to being intrinsic, I reversed the position and density of turban snails and mus- sels in four of the aquaria (those containing P. giganteus from the previous experiment) by gluing nylon strings to their shells and tying them in place in the tanks. Eight mussels were tied to</page><page sequence="8">Autumn 1968 PISASTER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 1069 TABLE 7. Numbers of mussels and snails eaten after their positions in the tanks were reversed.

The same procedure of check and replacement was followed. All the starfish ate some turban snails in the first 2 days but after that all starfish ate mussels almost exclusively (Table 7). Thus the strong preference for mussels does not seem to be related to accessibilty or relative density, but seems instead to have a behavioral basis-and to involve an active choice by the starfish. The following experiments involved only P. giganteus and two kinds of prey, the California mussel and the turban snail, because these were the easiest to collect and also the easiest to match in size. But it was possible that the selectivity for mussels might overwhelm the effect of experi- mental manipulation of other factors. Therefore, I first tried to modify the experimental set-up so that this selectivity would be smaller. A starfish searches by sweeping over an area with its arms extended. This is a very efficient way to get non- moving prey such as mussels. If the sweeping activity could be made more difficult, it seemed likely that the strength of selectivity for mussels might be at least temporarily reduced. To test this, I arranged six ordinary bricks (2 1cm by 10cm by 6.5cm) in two rows on the bottom of each aquarium as shown in Figure 4. I then placed 10 mussels haphazardly around the tank FIG. 4. Arrangements of bricks on the bottom of the aquaria used in selectivity experiments. Bricks were 21 cm by 10 cm by 6.5 cm and were laid flat. Mussels were placed in the spaces between the bricks. but between the bricks. Thirty turban snails were also present. This was replicated for 12 starfish. The data were numbers of mussels and snails eaten. These were recorded every day, and the experiment ran for 2 weeks. I made daily re- placements of dead individuals and weekly replace- ments of all individuals. The later controls were identical but for the absence of bricks and the use of different individual starfish. In the 2-week period, the starfish in the experimental situation (bricks present) ate 60-80% mussels (mean 71% ) while those in the control situation ate 80-97% mussels (mean 89%). This difference is clearly significant. The reduction in selectivity appar- ently resulted from a decrease in the overall con- sumption of mussels, and not from increased at- tention to snails, for the total consumption of snails was about the same in both cases, while the total consumption of mussels by the experimental starfish was less (Mann-Whitney U-test, P &lt; .01). The presence of bricks thus appeared to reduce the initial selectivity for mussels; therefore this feature was utilized in all subsequent experi- ments in which mussels and snails were used to- gether. Experiment 3. The effect of relative and absolute densities of alternative prey. Two factors that would seem to have an influ- ence on the selectivity of feeding in nature are the relative and absolute densities of alternative prey. Moreover, these factors may interact. To determine whether there are effects of these fac- tors, I designed the following experiment. For each of two densities, 16 and 40 prey per aqua- rium, the mussels and snails were arranged in the ratios 1:3 and 3: 1. Thus, the "low density" treatments had either 12 mussels and four snails, or vice versa, and the "high density" treatments had either 30 mussels and 10 snails, or vice versa. Each of these combinations had three replicates (for a total of 12 starfish). The experiment ran for 7 weeks, with the usual procedure of check and replacement carried out at 2-day intervals, at which time the numbers of snails and mussels eaten by each starfish were recorded. Possible sources of variability were 1) the water tempera- ture, which increased about 20C during this time (roughly 16'-18'C), and 2) the lighting condi- tions, which were not the same in all aquaria at first (after the first week a lush growth of algae formed on the top screens and made the lighting more even). Numerical analysis of these data posed several problems. To assess selectivity where there are different ratios of alternatives, one needs to take into account the departure from expectation based</page><page sequence="9">1070 DONALD E.

The E values are average values of Ivlev's "Electivity" index. The percentages are averages of mussels eaten by each of three repli- cates. SE values are standard errors of these average percentages. All values are computed on data pooled over the entire experiment (see text) Proportion Density of _ _ __ mussels (40 Prey/Tank) (16 Prey/Tank) E= .117 (.82 max.)

Several indices do this but all seem unsuitable for comparative purposes be- cause their ranges are not the same. An example is the index of Ivlev (1961): for the i th prey, if a;i is the percentage available and di is the per- centage in the diet, then Ivlev's "electivity index," Es, is given by the formula, Ei (di - .)/ (di + ai)- The electivity index shows that selectivity for mussels is two to four times higher when mussels are relatively rare than when they are relatively common. This curious result is a consequence of the way Selectivity" is computed. When the ratios of available alternatives differ, so does the absolute range of the electivity statistic. This approach can be defended by considering that, in sorting out alternatives, the starfish must reject snails in order to eat mussels. The electivity index emphasizes the fact that a nonpreferred prey must be rejected more frequently when it is abundant than when it is rare. This is a reason- able way to define selectivity, but it shows the problems involved in using various indices to de- scribe this complex phenomenon. In order to compare selectivity when ratios differ, one can compute for each treatment the nearness of the observed electivity to the maximum possible elec- tivity (the electivity that would be realized when one alternative was taken exclusively). These values are entered in parentheses after the elec- tivity values in Table 8. The most reasonable approach, however, seemed to be to take the pref- erences for granted and to determine whether an increased abundance of alternative prey signifi- cantly interfered with the consumption of mussels. Table 8 gives a summary of the raw data pooled over the entire experiment. It will be noted that the variances in the lower density cells are much larger than those in the high density cells; there- fore, strictly peaking, standard analytical proce- dures are inapplicable. Several modifications are possible but seemed unnecessary, for the summary is quite clear: the percentage of the preferred prey in the diet depends, in general, on its absolute density, and not on the relative abundance of al- ternatives. For purposes of discussion, reference will be made to the graphs, which show the percentage of mussels eaten relative to their availability. In all cases there appears an increase in selectivity with experience. There are no differences in selectivity between the two absolute densities where mussels predominate, except for one individual (Fig. 5), but where snails are the more abundant form there is a pronounced reduction in selectivity (even this lowered selectivity for mussels is statistically sig- nificant at P &lt; .01, using Chi-square as a crite- rion). The odd individual in Figure 5 is an interesting anomaly: this is a starfish which for some reason turned its attention to snails. It ate very few prey throughout the experiment; in fact, the last entry (55.2% mussels) is made up of individuals that were eaten over the last 4 weeks. This aberrant performance is hard to interpret, especially in view of the strong selectivity this starfish showed in the 100 80 c- 60 a) 4 40 I 20 0) A en E 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 C Q 800 600 ?'/. 40 .* ,' // 20 I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Groups of 30 prey FIG. 5.

Aside from this replicate there seems to be no apparent reduction in selectivity with a reduced density where mussels predominate. But this example illustrates best of all the great variability that can occur among in- dividual starfish when other factors seem to be constant. (The prey eaten by this starfish are included in the computations given in Table 8). Experiment 4. The effect of different relative densities when neither alternative is strongly preferred. The results of the previous experiments sug- gest that a strong initial preference exhibited where both alternative prey are equally abundant is likely to carry over when relative densities of alternatives differ. The question remains whether a preference might be induced by a change in rela- tive density in the case where neither of the alter- natives is favored initially. The two prey that could be used to test this were the spiny whelk and the turban snail. They seem to distribute themselves differently in the tanks: for example, turban snails occur relatively more frequently on the bottom (when bricks are present), whelks occur relatively more frequently on the sides. The starfish could probably make use of such differ- ences to hunt selectively for either alternative. In this experiment, 12 starfish in individual tanks were provided with 15 prey of both species. The ratios of whelk: snail were 3 :12, 5 :10, 10 :5, and 12:3. Each combination was replicated three times. Dead prey were replaced each day; all prey were replaced each week. The data are numbers of snails and whelks eaten by each star- fish over a 3-week period. The experiment was stopped after this because the weekly totals, though small in each case, indicated no change in selec- tivity during this time. The results (Table 9) show no consistent relationship between selec- tivity and relative density. The most interesting feature in the data is the significant heterogeneity among replicates in the same treatment. This did not appear in experiment 2A, where both alterna- tives were present in equal proportions; however, no independent evidence exists which shows that the two features are related. It is worth while to remark that Murdoch (MS in preparation) has also found significant heterogeneity among repli- cates in a similar experiment involving predatory snails feeding on mussels and barnacles. He was able to relate some of the heterogeneity to the apparent previous diet of the predators in the field. The results of experiment 4 are relevant to this suggestion because the starfish used in this experi- ment were naive to both prey species. The star- TABLE 9.

To my knowledge, neither prey ever occurs subtidally and neither prey occurs in- tertidally in this habitat. Experiment 5. The effect of previous experience on selectivity. L. Tinbergen's (1960) studies suggested to him that insectivorous birds develop a "search image," such that when one kind of prey becomes very common the birds tend to hunt specifically for it and to ignore others that they encounter. Accord- ing to the hypothesis, the search image is some- how induced by different relative densities of alternative prey. Once the search image is formed, selectivity is drastically altered. In the previous experiments the starfish did not alter selectivity when their alternative prey are made differently abundant; instead, their preferences seemed con- sistent. However, it is possible that, in nature, predators may become conditioned or imprinted as a result of feeding on one kind of very common prey over a long period. Then the preferences they exhibited at some future time would be a result of the different relative densities of prey which they encountered in the past. The change- over from one sort of prey to another could be a slow process, one not detectable during a short- term laboratory experiment. It is unfortunate that Tinbergen was not able to develop this most fascinating idea. As it now stands, it is stated in such broad terms that it can be made to fit any observation and so to test the idea is impossible. Still, it is worth while to try to test the idea that predators can be conditioned to a kind of prey and their selectivity thereby altered. One can get at this question by presenting to a group of experi- mental starfish only one kind of prey for a period of time, then making an alternative form avail- able also. Their selectivity can be compared to that of a control group whose individuals are pre-</page><page sequence="11">1072 DONALD E. LANDENBERGER Ecology, Vol. 49, No. 6 sented both alternatives without a previous period of exposure to either one. In this experiment, 11 starfish were allowed to feed only on turban snails for about 3 months. The median consumption during this period was about 200 prey per starfish (range 105-425). The first test on these animals involved selec- tivity for chitons (initial preference in this com- parison was for snails). Fifteen snails and 15 chitons were available; for 3 weeks the individuals eaten were counted and replaced every 2 days. As before, at the end of every week all individuals were replaced by fresh ones. The results are shown in Figure 6A. The arrow and area en- closed between the dotted lines show the mean and range in a later, independent control ( 11 repli- cates) lasting 10 days. The points and the lines bracketing them are the mean and ranges of the experimental starfish. Clearly, a smaller percent- age of chitons was taken by the conditioned star- fish, with no trend apparent in the data over the 3-week period. The same experimental starfish were then given 30 snails and 10 mussels, and the same procedure was followed for another 3 weeks. The results are shown in Figure 6B using the same representation c 60 0 -C o 40 ) 20 1 A 2 3 100 80 ? - 6,06 E,1 c 40 . 20 1 2 3 Weeks FIG. 6.

The arrows and lines show the mean and range, respectively, of independent controls. of control and experimental performance. In this case there was an initial effect of the conditioning, but this had disappeared by the second week. Again this change corresponded to a new search- ing behavior; the starfish turned to hunting mainly within the nest of bricks, where the mussels were. Similar effects were observed by Thorpe (1937) working with plant-eating insects, and by Wood (1965) working with carnivorous marine snails (oyster drills). Both interpreted their results as "olfactory conditioning." This explanation was especially appropriate in Wood's study, where the snails followed the effluent from a tank containing prey to which they had been exposed previously. In the case of the starfish, it is certain that olfac- tory stimuli are of great importance. But it is my untested impression that in this case hunting behavior was the conditioned response, that this was developed through experience with snails, and when mussels were again present, was readjusted to the distribution of mussels. However, olfactory conditioning cannot be ruled out; also, for starfish, hunting behavior and olfactory conditioning are not necessarily unrelated. Ivlev (1% 1) also found that selectivity by fish could be strengthened by conditioning to one kind of food. The intensity of the effect increased with the duration of pre- vious exposure, but he did not test to see how long the effect lasted. These results are relevant also to all the other experiments in this paper, because they suggest that organisms taken from different habitats, where they have been exposed to different sorts of prey, might exhibit different preferences in the labora- tory. All the starfish used in this experiment were collected at a pier, where they had been feeding mainly on mussels and to a lesser extent on barnacles and rock oysters (Chama sp.). It is safe to say that they had never had any experi- ence with any prey used in these experiments excepting the two Mytilus mussels. It is not known whether this influenced the kinds of pref- erences found in the experiments. INTERPRETATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The experiments showed that, in general, pref- erences for different prey are strong and form a pattern which is internally consistent. Moreover, the preferences were themselves consistent from one experiment to another. These facts deserve some comment. Adaptive significance of the preferences Behavioral factors, like any other biological at- tribute, can probably never be "explained"; one can merely suggest for them some adaptive sig- nificance. For the preferences shown by these</page><page sequence="12">Autumn 1968 PISASTER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 1073 starfish, the following apparent correlations exist: 1) in the case of mussels, the ranking of prefer- ences corresponds to the ranking of apparent strength of adductor muscles; 2) in the case of snails, the ranking is the same as the ranking of size of opercular opening. These impressions might suggest that the preferences are related to ease of feeding or to return per unit effort. How- ever, this logic is contradicted by the last place ranking of the chiton (a common food of starfish in nature), in which, apparently, the most meat was available for the least effort. This sort of ad hoc reasoning is not informative, however, and the general thesis that feeding be- havior is adaptive really needs no defense anyway. Moreover, the purpose of these experiments was to determine how selectivity is affected by environ- mental change, not to provide a rationale for the selectivity itself. Thus, the preferences were part of the raw material for these experiments; in the following discussion they are taken for granted. Increase in selectivity during the experiments A second feature common to all experiments was the trend toward greater selectivity as the experiments progressed. The interpretation of this result is challenging, and most likely no one simple explanation exists. Yet, to understand this would be to understand why apparent large-scale changes failed to alter preferences in any impor- tant way. Other workers (Holling 1965, Ivlev 1961) have based their interpretations of similar phenomena on the concepts of hunger and satia- tion. Animals are presumed to be least selective when hungry and most selective when satiated. A reduced selectivity when food is scarce is pre- sumed to be a consequence of hunger also. A number of physiological and behavioral facts make it difficult to apply this sort of thinking to starfish. Webster's New Collegiate dictionary de- fines hunger as 1) a craving or need for food; 2) an uneasy sensation occasioned normally by want of food; 3) a weakened condition brought about by lack of food. The first applies univer- sally, and it tautological. The second is strictly anthropomorphic, and although it may not mislead when applied to mammals (e.g. as by Young 1948) it is questionable whether it can be applied to lower organisms. The third definition seems to be a necessary component of the arguments based on "caloric maintenance requirements" and "adaptive strategies"; this too can be applied only to mammals and birds, at least when relatively short periods of time are considered, as is the case in most experiments. I have kept individual star- fish in the laboratory for more than 5 months without food. All survived with no apparent ill effects or weakening, for at the end of this period they were immediately able to resume feeding on the largest mussels available (California mussels over 14 cm long). Similar abilities to withstand long periods of deprivation have been reported for starfish by Feder (1956) and are probably common in reptiles and fish as well as in many invertebrates. Cold-blooded animals do not have short-term maintenance requirements and one would therefore not expect that they would have to respond to short-term deprivation (Ricker 1952). So much for hunger. A. for satiation, the dictionary defines it as "gratified to repletion," such that "interest or desire is destroyed." This implies a reduction of interest in feeding, which in turn implies a lowered rate of feeding. But in these experiments, feeding intensity increased as selectivity increased. Moreover, well-fed starfish can eat, per week, up to 50 mussels of the size used in these experiments; this can go on for many weeks (Landenberger 1967). No individual in any of the above experiments came close to this empirical maximum; in all cases, the rate of con- sumption was well below it. I have never ob- served a sign of satiation in any starfish; in the laboratory, disinterest in feeding has been con- fined to the early period of captivity and probably has resulted from handling or other disturbances. In other words, starfish were always ready to eat, but were probably neither hungry nor satiated. Therefore, I believe that this case requires a dif- ferent logical approach. A consistent association between rate of feeding and degree of selectivity showed up in each experi- ment. One finds the same phenomenon in the data of Ivlev's experiments on fish (Ivlev 1961, p. 55-60), although he didn't comment on it. In his study, as in this one, the rate of feeding in- creased with time; the predators were being most selective when they were feeding at a high rate. The association is suggestive. It leads one to sus- pect a common cause. I think it is that the preda- tors learn to hunt better as they gain experience; this is consistent with observations of their hunt- ing behavior. Therefore, my interpretation of the experimental results (taking the initial preferences for granted) is as follows: (1) The predators gained experience during the experiment and so they became better able to concentrate on the prey they preferred. This en- abled them to eat more, in an absolute sense, as well as to eat more selectively. (2) In each case, the initial temporary weak- ening of selectivity was a consequence of the "noise" introduced into the experiment by a</page><page sequence="13">1074 DONALD E. LANDENBERGER Ecology, Vol. 49, No. 6 relatively large number of lower-ranked alterna- tives. This confusion was merely superimposed upon a basic pattern; the same preferences were always reasserted as the predators gained expe- rience. Relevance of the experimental results to predatory behavior in the field The factors that caused changes in intensity of preference are ones which might act in the field. However, because the weakening of the preferences was only temporary in all cases, I do not believe that the results can be generalized to long periods of time, e.g. the mere presence of many kinds of alternative prey, or disparate relative abundances of prey probably do not, in themselves, have any long-term effect on selectivity in nature. Preferential feeding and ecological theory One of the most interesting ideas about the effects of predation is the suggestion that preda- tors can moderate competition and induce stability in a community by switching their attention from one alternative prey to another as each becomes abundant. This was clearly enunciated by Elton (1927) and is also explicit in the theoretical de- velopment of MacArthur (1955). The "search image" hypothesis of Tinbergen provides a theo- retical mechanism by which this can work. The results of these experiments may bear on this hypothesis to some extent. Most important, these experiments show that the behavioral flexi- bility necessary to adjust to different kinds or distributions of prey exist in an animal ordinarily considered to be a lower form. This behavioral flexibility (more simply, learning ability) may well be found in most if not all predators; adaptive changes in behavior are not confined to birds and mammals. However, the model in question neces- sitates a switching of preferences. In these labora- tory experiments no such switching occurred. It seems doubtful that it could occur under conditions where such strong initial preferences obtain, for in this case the predators adapted their hunting behavior to the preferred prey regardless of its relative abundance. Thus, to make a test in the laboratory, one would have to use alternative prey that are well-matched; even if the hypothesis is then found to apply to some cases, its generality would still seem to depend upon the extent to which strong preferences occur in nature. How common this is can only be guessed at. Reports on the feeding behavior of other kinds of starfish suggest that they do feed preferentially in the field (see the review of Reese 1966 for several examples). Feder (1956) has shown that Pisas- ter ochraceus eats many different species of prey in the field and in the laboratory; he also sug- gested that in the field some kinds of prey may l4e taken preferentially under certain conditions. He related some of this apparent nonrandom feed- ing to the fact that some kinds of prey have flight responses to starfish whereas others donot. A preference for Mytilus under field conditions would have interesting consequences. Intertidal Pisaster (mainly P. ochraceus) typically occur associated with dense aggregations of mussels or barnacles; other prey species have distributions which are different from these. For example, turban snails usually occur around the bases of rocks or at the edges of rock pools; the carnivo- rous whelks Thais and Acanthina are sometimes found in mussel beds, but seems most often to frequent crevices among- barnacle-covered open rock faces at a somewhat higher level on the beach. Chitons occur on open rock faces at all levels. A preference for mussels could act in such a way that the starfish would wander continuously from one aggregation of mussels to another, taking the nonpreferred species as they are encountered dur- ing the wandering. On rocky shores in southern California, the starfish do seem to be densely ag- gregated only around mussels. At Ellwood Pier, both intertidally (on mussel beds) and on the bottom (beneath intertidal mussel beds), the star- fish aggregate only in areas where mussels are abundant. Experimental evidence shows that these aggregations are dynamic; individuals aggre- gate in specific areas, then move on to other such areas. Learning has been suggested as a possible explanation for such directed movement (Landen- berger 1967). Thus, starfish may feed selectively in the field as well as in the laboratory. The field observa- tions are suggestive, but in each case a major qualification is the kind of sampling (if any) used to assess "availability." Previous studies have almost always involved subjective impressions of relative abundance. Problems of sampling make it very hard to document these impressions. A recent study which relates diet to availability is that of Gerald (1966) on the feeding habits of dace. His observations suggested that, in the field, dace feed on prey in proportion to their availability; this is fairly well supported by inde- pendent estimates of the availability and location of the prey. It is certainly possible that the strong prefer- ences found in laboratory studies are realized be- cause of abnormally high densities of prey in a relatively simple context, a condition which may occur only rarely in the field. In summary, a generalization of these experi-</page><page sequence="14">Autumn 1968 GROWTH RATES OF A SEA URCHIN 1075 mental results to nature depends completely on whether strong preferences occur in nature. These experiments shed no light on this question, but they do emphasize its importance to ecology. LITERATURE CITED Brillouin, L. 1962. Science and information theory (2nd ed.)
