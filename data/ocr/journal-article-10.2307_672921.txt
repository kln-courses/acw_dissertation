Reviewed by ETHEL NURGE University of Kansas Medical Center Growing Up in a Philippine Barrio is as much an ethnography as it is a case study in education and maybe more so. The village of Malitbog (pseudonym) on the island of Pa- nay in the western Bisayans is five miles from a national road and has wet rice agri- culture as the mainstay of life, although dry rice is also planted. The village probably has about eight hundred members, although the author is imprecise on this matter (p. 6), saying there are one thousand farmers in ninety-seven households, each family unit having from six to ten members, mostly children. This cannot come to one thousand; it probably is about eight hundred. The vil- lage has been both Roman Catholic and Protestant and there is a heavy residue of ancient animistic beliefs. Formal education in the village is neither extensive nor effective. The barrio has a two-room schoolhouse operated by the gov- ernment and managed locally by two teach- ers who handle four classes. First graders are mixed with second graders in Room A and third graders with fourth graders in Room B. Children are admitted at age seven and above, are taught in the local language, and, by the second grade, get vocabulary in the national language-Tagalog. In the third grade, English is added. This heavy linguis- tic burden, as well as the limited exposure to formal education, means that none of the lan- guages are learned effectively. After the children have been away from school a few years, they are just as illiterate as those who have not gone to school at all (p. 50). Con- sidering the author's judgment on the inef- fectiveness of the school, which is corrobo- rated by my own experience and that of other Philippine scholars, it is perhaps nei- ther surprising nor belittling of Growing Up in a Philippine Barrio to say that it contains little on formal education but rather places its emphasis on other learning experiences throughout life. Some of the subjects covered are the adult's view of the child, birth control, preg- nancy and birth, weaning, puberty and ado-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1529 lescence, courtship and marriage, kinship, family and household, and death and burial; there are also interesting chapters on social order and value orientation and on the super- natural world. There is a wealth of good de- scriptive material in this book, and I might cite in particular the chapter on family and household, which is one of the best for ex- plicit statements on socialization, material on the perception and conceptualization of the supernatural world, and an excellent summary on the nature and context of learning in daily life in traditional society (Chapter 14). Jocano gives a provocative bit of informa- tion on children's incorporation of knowl- edge of the supernaturals. Between five and eight years of age, children describe super- naturals as real people, usually old men and women who live in the barrio. They are pic- tured as aggressive humans who like to eat the internal organs of children. Between the ages of eight and ten, children know the su- pernatural beings as powerful figures who transform themselves into such animals as pigs, dogs, cats, and goats; who live in a dif- ferent, though similar, style to that of hu- mans; and who are immortal. These beings carry off disobedient children and can also attack adults. From the ages of ten years to adolescence, these anthropomorphic beings become alive and dangerous to the growing youngsters. They are believed to participate actively in human affairs and are pictured as physically most aggressive (p. 110). More research on this subject might be useful both for perceptual theory and for the testing of the hypotheses of Linton, Kardiner, and Whiting et al. The role of the anthropologist in studying this community is not discussed, and I wish that such information had been given. Also welcome would have been information on the number and representativeness of infor- mants. Jocano mentions once (p. 40) that he observed 104 children between the ages of six and ten during 1964 and 1965, and that seventy-five of them were confined to bed for various illnesses during that time. This is provocative but meager; it would be better set in a context where his interaction with the villagers over time was described. Likewise, it would be good to know some- thing about his method of working and his language ability. Jocano mentions three dia- lects for the western Bisayans (p. 3), but he does not say what the people of Malitbog speak, nor what his facility in the dialect was. Lastly, there is no mention (with one exception) nor integration of the numerous other socialization studies made in the Phil- ippines.</page></plain_text>
