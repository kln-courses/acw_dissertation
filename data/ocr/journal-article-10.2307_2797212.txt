<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAY-JUNE, I965 MAN No. 59 ANTHROPOLOGY, PSYCHIATRY AND THE DOCTRINE OF CULTURAL RELATIVISM* By Derek Freeman, Ph.D., Institute of Advanced Studies, Australian National University, Canberra r- o Let me begin by giving a succinct outline of 59 the doctrine of cultural relativism. It has been stated in its most explicit form by the American anthropo- logist Melville Herskovits in his book Man and his Works (1948). The principle on which cultural relativism rests has been stated by Herskovits in these words: 'Judgments are based on experience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation.' With this principle, in itself, there can be little disagree- ment, for it is certainly true that the judgments which men form are, ordinarily, much influenced by the values of the culture in which they have grown up. Thus, Sapir and Whorf have shown the extent to which human languages, as symbol systems, colour and distort the thinking and experience of those who use them. This state of affairs we may then admit. But it is also true, and most importantly, that men may transcend the limitations of cultural evaluations by means of scientific enquiry and discovery-for science is a system of enquiry and knowledge that transcends the separate cultures of mankind. It is not, however, this unexceptionable principle of cultural conditioning, but the inferences drawn from it, that make up the doctrine of cultural relativism. These are the inferences that whatever occurs in any particular cul- ture is 'normal,' and can be understood and evaluated only in terms of the culture of which it is a part. These inferences are plain in the reply made by Hersko- vits to the psychiatrist Dorsainvil, who had described the state of possession hysteria that characterizes Haitian voodoo as 'a religious psycho-neurosis.' 'In terms of the patterns of Haitian religion,' wrote Herskovits, ' possession is not abnormal but normal, it is set in a cultural mold as are all other phases of conventional living.' Thus, the cultural relativist conceives of a culture as a reality sui generis, as something given and self-explanatory. Culture is looked upon as a closed system, which can be assessed only in its own terms, and which, therefore, can- not be analysed, interpreted and evaluated in other and more objective ways. This doctrine, as Bidney has noted, has proved most congenial to many contemporary anthropologists. I wish to advance the view that cultural relativism is an unscientific doctrine. It is my opinion, indeed, that not until this doctrine has been transcended will it be possible for a true science of man to come into being. To assert, as does Herskovits, that behaviour is normal because it is set in a cultural mold, is to say no more than that it is shared and accepted by the members of the culture concerned, but dereistic thinking and behaviour are not one wit the less dereistic because they happen to be shared and accepted. Indeed, the fact that a delusional belief is shared commonly results in an intensification of affect for the individual participant rather than in any diminution. A basic question, then, is this: Can a culture, either in whole or in part, be diagnosed as abnormal or maladapted, in a psychiatrical sense? This, it will be noted, is essentially the same question put by Freud in his essay, Civilization and its Discontents. 'If,' asks Freud, 'the development of civilization has such a far-reaching similarity to the development of the indi- vidual and if it employs the same methods, may we not be justified in reaching the diagnosis that, under the influ- ence of cultural urges, some civilizations, or some epochs of civilization-possibly the whole of mankind-have become "neurotic" ?' And he goes on to express the hope that 'one day someone will venture to embark' (despite the difficulties involved) upon 'a pathology of cultural communities.' In the quotation which I have just cited Freud remarks on the similarity between cultural and individual pheno- mena. This, as Freud himself stresses, is an analogy, but it is, nonetheless, an analogy with some substance, for the same primary process thinking that characterizes the fantasies, dreams and symbolic behaviour of individuals also characterizes the myths and rituals of cultures, and this for the good reason that these cultural or shared forms of symbolic behaviour are all, finally, endopsychic in origin. One of the assertions of cultural relativists is that cultural phenomena, however bizarre, by the very fact of their existence, prove 'that they perform their essential tasks. Otherwise, the societies wherein they function would not survive.' This argument, though specious, is of little weight, for, in a positivistic way, it confuses mere survival with essential or adequate functioning. Konrad Lorenz has remarked that 'in the evolutionary process you find everything that is just good enough for survival'; and this, I would suggest, is a basically important realization. Neuroses and psychoses, certainly, are adapta- tions of a kind: ways in which an emotionally and mentally disturbed individual manages to go on surviving-thus the so-called positive value of the neurosis. In the same way, it is clearly possible for pathological cultural adapta- tions to achieve survival, and yet remain pathological. The cultural relativist, we have seen, looks on culture as a thing in itself, he conceptualizes it as a closed, self- explanatory system. He accepts culture as something given, and does not enquire into its origins. This, it may be noted, is close to the view of the uneducated who accept the culture into which they happen to have been born, rather as a teapot accepts hot water. The evidence of research in palaeo-anthropology, a * This article is based on a communication to the Inaugural Congress of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists on 27 October, I964. + 6</page><page sequence="2">No. 59 MAN MAY-JUNE, I965 branch of anthropology which in recent years has made great progress, enables us to view human cultures in what is, I believe, a more scientific way. There is now decisive scientific evidence that man is an animal, and has evolved from a primate stock. This means that at an early stage in this evolution there were proto- hominoids without any form of culture. It follows that man s nature, as a phylogenetic entity, was evolved prior to the emergence of culture. Thus, the scientific way to look at culture is as a biological adaptation by way of which evolving human animals have come to terms with their natural impulses and their environment (including their social environment). The picture which the anthropological evidence compels us to form is of an evolving proto-hominoid, vastly ignorant of the nature of its own organism, of its origins, and of the processes of the world about it; which yet, by the use of a symbol system, its own invention, and an inquisitiveness born of long millennia of primate existence, embarked on the uniquely human course of seeking, by the use of its tacit powers of comprehending experience, the meaning of its existence and the nature of the world about it. Now primitive cultures, as they have been observed, always contain a number of behaviours which are highly adaptive and rational, but they commonly also contain forms of ritual behaviour of a very different character, and indeed, these are frequently of a kind which, removed from their socio-cultural setting, are plainly psycho- pathological. How then did such pathological adaptations come into being? My hypothesis is that they are the outcome of primary process thinking, which is universally character- istic of the human animal, being manifested in his dreams and fantasies, his myths and rituals, and which is the product of his impulsive or instinctive nature. This, of course, is no new hypothesis, for many psycho- analysts and psychiatrists have drawn attention to primary process thinking in primitive cultures, and to the close resemblance which it bears to schizophrenic thought; as, for example, Roheim in his book Magic and Schizophrenia. Again, Bettelheim has recorded how groups of children at the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School of the University of Chicago, 'all of whom could be classified as schizoid if not schizophrenic,' spontaneously devised rituals which closely resemble those found in primitive societies. In primitive societies, then,-as indeed in all others-we encounter shared fantasies (which we call mvths) and modes of symbolic acting-out (which we call rituals) all of which spring from primary process thinking, and which are thus projections of the human animal's impulsive, phylogeneti- cally given nature. Loren Eisely, who has aptly described man as 'a dream animal,' puts the matter dramatically by saying: 'ancestral man entered his own head, and he has been adapting ever since to what he finds there.' This of course means that culture, in its symbolic and ritual aspects, is not a closed but a projective system; and, therefore, as Schilder and others have noted, cultural phenomena have to be interpreted or deciphered like a neurotic symptom or like a dream. The implications of this for the science of anthropology are of a radical and revolutionary kind. Let us now glance at some instances of the kind of cultural phenomena of which I have been speaking. I have selected three examples from the many available in the ethnographical record. (i) The first is the deception of anus-plugging as it existed among the Chaga, a Bantu people of the Kenya highlands near Kilimanjaro. Chaga men justify their claim to ascendancy over women by acquiring power over a bodily function that women cannot control; they maintain that during initiation the anus is stopped up permanently and that men thereafter retain their faces. To be 'stopped up' is identical with acquiring the rights of an adult male, and, the stopping-up of the anus is the central rite of initiation. Thus the novices are told: 'Don't emit wind in the presence of women and uninitiated youth. If you do the tribal elders will slaughter your cows. Neither must you be surprised by women when you defaccate. Always carry a stick with you, dig your faeces in, and scratch about here and there pretending that you are digging for some charm ... If you dare to tell anybody of the secret of men, then your age group, the tribal elders and the chief will without mercy deprive you of all you own.' Until recently the fiction was carried through to its final conclusion with a performance in which the plug was removed. A group of men would gather at the home of an old man and slaughter a goat, tying bleeding pieces of meat around his thighs so that blood ran down and covered his legs. Then they would remove and hide the bloody meat and call his wife, entrusting the old man to her care and explaining to her that her husband had had his plug removed for his son's sake and that the bleeding started when the stitches were taken out. Here in brief, we have the acting-out of a fantasy that springs from envy of women and the impulsive desire to dominate them. (2) My second example is from the culture of the Aztec of ancient Mexico. The Aztec shared the delusional belief that the sun was an anthropomorphic god, Tonatiuh, and that his vitality must continually be renewed by human sacrifice. Thus, the breasts of sacrificial victims were cut open, and their hearts removed, and held aloft in presenta- tion to the sun god, to keep him satiated with blood, and so strong and virile. Here, we have a delusional projection of human proper- ties onto a purely physical object, with highly pathological consequences. (3) My third example comes from the culture of the Willigiman-Wallalua, a contemporary people of western New Guinea, recently studied by an expedition from Harvard University. The eschatological beliefs of these people demand the ritual amputation of the fingers of young girls to placate the ghosts of the dead. So, when an eight-year-old boy was killed in a raid by a neighbouring tribe, three girls were selected by their elders to donate two fingers each as funeral gifts, and each had two joints of each digit ritually amputated with a stone axe. 66</page><page sequence="3">MAY-JUNE, I965 MAN Nos. 59, 6o Here, as I would interpret these barbaric rites, we have a shared delusional belief system, in which living humans project on to the non-existent ghosts of the dead their own aggressive and revengeful impulses, and then, out of fear, are impelled to placate that which threatens them by the sacrificial offering of the fingers of their own children. Each of these three examples of cultural behaviour, if removed from its socio-cultural setting, is seen to be symbolic behaviour of a neurotic if not psychotic kind. I feel sure that such would be the diagnosis of a psychiatrist if he encountered such behaviours in the course of his ordinary practice. There remains the question of whether such behaviours can be properly diagnosed as neurotic or psychotic in their original cultural setting. This, I think, would be the view of some psychiatrists. Karl Menninger, for example, in Man Against Himself, expresses the opinion that: 'Psychiatrists would regard the extreme martyr and ascetic as individuals completely gone over to the acceptance of an unrealistic interpretation of life, a kind of socially accepted psychosis.' And in The Human Mind, in discussing mass paranoia, he writes of the 'psychosis' of the German nation. In considering this question we ought, in my judgment, to be cautious of the dangers of thinking by analogy. Devereux, rightly in my opinion, has stressed the need to distinguish between cultural beliefs (even though they may be delusory in character) and delusions proper, as they occur in individual psychotics. The distinction, I would suggest, is that a cultural belief (as the etymology of the word indicates) is received from someone else, commonly someone in a position of dominance, by way of such psychological processes as identification: whereas a delusion proper is idiosyncratic, predominantly or wholly endopsychic, and born of morbidity. It remains true, however, that the unconscious and primary mental processes of all the members of a culture are, in basic ways, identical with those to be foumd in neurotics and psychotics. It is this state of affairs that accounts for the fact that paranoid ideas and delusions are so often contagious. Again, it would seem likely that delusory cultural beliefs and mass delusions can, in very many cases, be traced to the delusions of a neurotic or psychotic individual in the group. There is here a field in the exploration and under- standing of which psychiatrists and anthropologists might fruitfully collaborate. I have, during the course of my remarks, several times used the term pathological to describe certain forms of cultural behaviour. The final question which I would like to advance for discussion is this: How are pathological forms of cultural and social behaviour to be recognized and defined ? Clearly, if the science of anthropology is to transcend the doctrine of cultural relativism it must evolve ways in which human behaviour-of whatever culture-can be scientifically and normatively evaluated, this being an essential step towards the discovery (to use the words of Bidney) of 'universal principles of cultural dynamics and concrete rational norms capable of universal realization.' In attempting this task, the values and discoveries of the science of psychiatry are, in my view, of the greatest relevance, and I believe that the best and most scientific criteria presently available for the evaluation of behaviour are those currently being evolved in research on states of positive mental health. I would like to mention two impor- tant books dealing with the results of this research: Marie Jahoda's Current Concepts of Positive Mental Health and Abraham Maslow's Toward a Psychology of Being. I shall not here attempt to survey this significant field of research, but I would like to take as an example one of the criteria that appears in most definitions of mental health: superior reality perception. Money-Kyrle, a prominent Kleinian analyst, has recently indicated that he believes it possible to call a neurotic person not only relatively inefficient but absolutely inefficient, simply because he does not perceive the real world as accurately or as efficiently as does the healthy person. 'A man's beliefs,' he writes, 'do not have a relative degree of truth measured by their approximation to the prevalent beliefs of his own or some other culture arbi- tarily chosen as a frame of reference. They have an absolute degree of truth measured by their approximation to the facts which alone can prove or disprove them.' In other words, the neurotic is not only emotionally sick-he is cognitively wrong. Here we have an empirical and scientific principle which is very different from that advanced by Herskovits, and which enables those who employ it to transcend the doctrine of cultural relativism.</page></plain_text>
