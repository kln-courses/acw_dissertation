<plain_text><page sequence="1">Secondary Restorations in the Post-Amarna Period* Peter Brand With the collapse after his death of Akhen- aten's religious revolution, his successors were left to repair the damage caused by his disposses- sion and persecution of the orthodox cults, espe- cially that of Amen-Re. As early as the reign of the shadowy figure Smenkhkare, and continuing in earnest during the time of his immediate suc- cessor Tutankhamen, the royal house made very public and expensive reparations to the divine cults for the damage Akhenaten had wrought: the estates of the gods were re-endowed with proper- ties and resources the heretic had stripped from them. This restitution came at the expense of the royal house and doubtless, although this is no- where mentioned in the ancient texts, from the estate of the Aten cult as well. In the midst of this counter-revolution, Tut- ankhamen died after a reign of nine years without an heir.1 Next came a succession of appointees to the throne: the ephemeral Ay, general Horem- heb and Ramesses I. Soon after his accession, Horemheb saw his own advantage in dishonoring the memory, of not only the heretic Akhenaten, but those of Tutankhamen and Ay as well.2 In carrying out this policy, Horemheb usurped or dismantled the monuments of Tutankhamen and Ay wherever they occurred. But what changes to the ongoing process of restoring the traditional cults did Horemheb 's damnatio memoriae of Tut- ankhamen and Ay bring? * I am grateful to W. R. Johnson, who was originally slated to publish on this topic, for deferring it to me and for a number of stimulating discussions. I would also like to thank William J. Murnane who reviewed the manuscript and offered a number of useful suggestions. Repairs to monuments vandalized by Akhen- aten's agents are widespread;3 even the most cur- sory examination of Eighteenth Dynasty temple reliefs at sites like Karnak and Luxor reveals defacements and repairs to reliefs and inscrip- tions naming Amen-Re and other deities. Sur- prisingly, however, little effort has been made to understand their technical features, and histo- rians have largely taken the whole process for granted. Mostly, they have focused on a handful of the ancient texts commenting on the restora- tion period,4 including Tutankhamen's Restora- tion Decree promulgated sometime in his earliest years.5 It records how the temples throughout Egypt from Elephantine to the Delta marshes had fallen into decay. In picturesque language, the sacred precincts are described as "mounds overgrown with grass," and the temple buildings as footpaths.6 The decree - which treats other aspects of the restoration program, such as the replacement of costly cult equipment, in detail - largely glosses over both the exact condition of the monuments and the king's measures to put the damage right.

Instead they focus on the replacement of the most costly and prestigious sorts of cult equipment such as sacred barques and ritual utensils made of precious materials, as we find in Tutankhamen's Restora- tion Decree.8 Heretofore, scholars have paid scant attention to the largest task that faced the champions of orthodoxy, namely the repair of vandalized re- liefs featuring Amen-Re and other gods on mon- uments throughout the land. And yet between Tutankhamen's accession and Seti I's, not less than a quarter century9 had elapsed during which Tutankhamen, Ay and Horemheb were making extensive repairs to disfigured monuments at Karnak, Luxor and elsewhere in the Theban re- gion and throughout Egypt and Nubia. Begin- ning with Tutankhamen, one finds a scattering of brief restoration texts employing the phrase sniDwy-mnw, "renewal of monuments," but these are relatively scarce during his reign,10 and those of Ay11 and Horemheb,12 and there was no stan- dardized formula at this time. As one might ex- pect, Horemheb supplanted his predecessor's cartouche in nearly every one of these texts.13 It is Seti I, however, who is perhaps best known for such repairs because he frequently marked them with a smjwy-mnw formula placed conspic- uously along processional ways, on monumental gateways, the lunettes of stelae and the facades of pylons. They are seldom found in dark re- cesses and side rooms of the temples. But, given that restorations had been underway for many years before Seti, one may question whether so many monumental reliefs were still unrestored at his accession - especially in such prominent locations - as his own renewal inscriptions seem to attest. Recently, a handful of researchers have begun to examine the repairs made to the monuments themselves. On close examination, through care- ful scrutiny of details, they have noticed that many of the mended reliefs have had a more complicated history than has previously been un- derstood. These observations are providing new insights into a dramatic shift in policy during the restoration period, namely that the complete sup- pression of Tutankhamen's name in the monu- mental record extended to his repair work on the monuments. It had been noticed that reliefs and inscrip- tions mended in the post-Amarna era had some- times been modified after they had first been rehabilitated. In a number of instances it has been demonstrated that Tutankhamen's name was supplanted by that of Horemheb or Seti I in inscriptions which had originally credited him as the restorer of some vandalized relief.14 More 7 E.g., Horemheb's Coronation Inscription: Urk. IV, 2119:13-17. 8 Urk. IV, 2028: 12ff. The main source of uncertainty is the length of Horem- heb's reign. The highest uncontroversial date for Horemheb is year 13, but seven years preceding it are unattested, includ- ing a three-year interval between 9 and 12. J.

In fact, he often claimed to be "restoring monuments" (smjwy-mnw) , that he was merely completing or embellishing.

There is an example of a secondary restora- tion on the east face of the Karnak Sixth Pylon. Here the cartouches in three smjwy-mnw texts of Tutankhamen have been usurped by Horemheb (fig. I).16 Although first noted by Barguet and later by Schaden, they have largely escaped no- tice.17 The decoration on the east face includes three scenes with Thutmose III before Amen-Re and Mut, and two of these divine images have been reworked. Barguet and Schaden, however, did not comment on this recutting, in keeping with the tendency of most Egyptologists to ignore the epigraphic features of restored reliefs. The most extensive modifications are found on the south tower where the final version of Amen-Re 's figure is considerably larger than the previous one, with traces of the incised outlines being embedded in the revised icon (fig. I).18 Both editions were done in raised relief. One might argue that the earlier traces stem from the original Thutmoside figure hacked out by Akhen- aten, but this possibility can be rejected for a number of reasons: (1) The earlier Amen figure was somewhat shorter than Thutmose Ill's image which was never vandalized. The divine and royal figures in ritual scenes are normally at the same scale.19 Yet in some restorations of Tutankhamen, the divine figure was restored on a smaller scale than the Fig. 1. Secondary restoration of Horemheb with smBwy- mnw text usurped from Tutankhamen. The smaller figure embedded in the final version belongs to the original post- Amarna restoration of Tutankhamen.

PM II2, 89 (245). pre-Amarna original and the accompanying di- vine figure.20 (2) Traces of the earlier version are mostly concentrated in the upper portions of the figure, particularly its head, headdress, shoulders and arms. These vestiges consist of the incised out- lines of an earlier bas relief which are largely intact and are not interrupted by gouging. This suggests that the earlier version was erased and not hacked out. It is clear from other reliefs 15 S.

(3) The original surface has been cut back further in the upper half of the relief. This area displays the most evidence of reworking, yet lacks virtually any traces of hacking. By comparison, the legs and lower torso of the figure exhibit com- paratively little reworking, but here traces of Amarna hacking remain. This had been filled in with plaster, some of which still adheres. From these observations, it is apparent that the upper portion of this icon has been more ex- tensively reworked in the post-Amarna era than the lower one. Moreover, the earliest detectable version of this relief has been erased rather than hacked out as was the standard method of de- stroying reliefs under Akhenaten. How, then, are we to explain the earlier version? Careful erasure of a relief was the standard method used to re- move a relief that was to be surcharged, while hacking was reserved for destroying all traces of a relief that was not to be replaced or usurped. It is apparent, then, that both versions of these divine figures must date to the post-Amarna era, and that the final one was a usurpation of an ear- lier post-Amarna restoration. Similar adjustments to the proportions of Amen and Mut on the north tower of the pylon are not as extensive as the one on the south wing. Fig. 2. Secondary restoration of Horemheb usurped from Tutankhamen with relatively minor adjustments made to the divine figure. Karnak Sixth Pylon, east face, north tower. PM II2, 89 (240). In the case of the second Amen figure, Tutankh- amen's rendition of the god was on the same scale as that of the king. So, only minor adjust- ments to the calf and ankle of his forward leg and to his right shoulder were made (fig. 2). The obvious candidates for these two editions of the Sixth Pylon reliefs are Tutankhamen and Horemheb. Horemheb is well known for his usurpations of Tutankhamen's titulary on the monuments through the careful erasure and re- placement of his predecessor's cartouches. As noted earlier, Horemheb has usurped the smjwy- mnw inscriptions that accompany three of the scenes on the Pylon. In each cartouche, the sun disk is higher than the rest of the glyphs, and traces of Nb-hprw belonging to Tutankhamen's prenomen can be made out amongst elements of 21 See P. Brand, "Methods Used in Restoring Reliefs Van- dalized during the Amarna Period," GM 170 (1999), 37-48. When raised relief is shaved down, engraved outlines often remain. This is common when a raised relief is erased and/ or usurped. An example of this are erased cartouches of Tut- ankhamen and Ay on the former's temple "The Mansion of Nebkhepurure in Thebes." See O. Schaden, "Report on the 1978 Season at Karnak," NARCE 127 (Fall, 1984), 56-61. 11 E.g., Brunner, Die siidliche Rdume des Tempels von Luxor, pl. 189a.

The supplanted cartouches may provide an explanation for Horemheb's ad- justments to the icons themselves. Marc Gabolde of the Centre Franco-Egyptien d 'etudes des temples de Karnak, to whom I am grateful for having first called my attention to the significance of these reliefs, suggested that Horemheb may have al- tered them to justify his appropriation of the smjwy-mnw texts.24 Bickel suggests that the re- working of the figure might date to Seti I's reign, based on reliefs of that king which have been recut, particularly those in the Karnak Hypostyle Hall.25 This, however, seems doubtful, as the Hypostyle Hall reliefs were recut for very differ- ent reasons.26 In fact, this instance of secondary restoration is not an isolated phenomenon. As we shall see, it was a widespread practice during the reigns of Tutankhamen's immediate successors, and often coincides with the titulary of one of these kings, usually in the form of a smjwy-mnw inscription. Heretofore, only a handful of such secondary restorations have ever been identified, but nei- ther their precise significance nor their true ex- tent has been understood by most scholars. Murnane noted that two barque scenes from the north face of the Eighth Pylon at Karnak, initially renovated by Tutankhamen, had subsequently been modified, one by Horemheb and the other by Seti I.27 In both cases, the object had been to supplant Tutankhamen's prenomen on the canopy and veil of the processional barque of Amen-Re where it appeared in rebus form. More recently, Bickel has noted that depictions of Amen-Re on blocks from the memorial temple of Amenhotep III reused in the foundations of the memorial temple of Merenptah had been restored by Tutankhamen, and later reworked by Seti I who also usurped some of Tutankh- amen s smjwy-mnw texts/ It was W. Raymond Johnson, director of the Epigraphic Survey, however, who first identified secondary restorations as a recurring phenom- enon. Research into the monuments of Seti I were leading the present author to similar con- clusions about his restorations, but I am most grateful to Johnson for stimulating discussions which helped clarify the true nature of the issue and for pointing out a number of examples pre- dating Seti. Having introduced the phenomenon of secondary restorations, the evidence will now be examined chronologically to trace its scope and development. The Extent and Nature of Tutankhamen's Restorations of Vandalized Reliefs During his ten year reign, Tutankhamen un- dertook a costly and wide-scale program to re- vive the traditional cults of the gods, especially that of Amen-Re. From his two restoration stelae we know that he reopened the temples, gave them even larger endowments of property than before, and fashioned new cult equipment of precious materials. The relatively large corpus of stone stat- uary representing Amen-Re and other Theban gods from this time attests to his restoration program.29 Doubtless, sculptors were also occu- pied with mending vandalized reliefs and inscrip- tions on temple walls and stelae. 23 Schaden, NARCE 138, 14, fig. 11. 2 M. Gabolde by personal communication. 25 Bickel, Tore und andere wiederverwendete Bauteile Ameno- phis' III, RABA 16, 97. 26 See the present author's Ph.D. dissertation, The Monu- ments of Seti I and their Historical Significance: "Epigraphic, Art Historical and Historical Analysis," Ph.D. dissertation (University of Toronto, 1998), §§1.3 and 3.69.3. On the north wall of the Karnak Hypostyle Hall, a number of royal and divine figures have been adjusted slightly, what might be termed cosmetic retouching, and perhaps reflects the "grow- ing pains" of the sculptors working on the project. No further adjustments are found on the king's reliefs in the Hall be- yond the north wall. On the jambs of the north gateway, a number of the king's images have been drastically recut to change his posture from an upright position to a bowing one vis-a-vis the deity. This sort of iconographic change is very different from either the cosmetic retouching found on adja- cent reliefs on the north wall or secondary restorations. 27 W. J. Murnane, "Tutankhamun on the Eighth Pylon at Karnak," VA 1 (1985), 59-68. 28 Bickel, Tore und andere wiederverwendete Bauteile Ameno- phis'IIL, BABA 16, pls. 34, 35d, 70 and 80; idem, BIFAO 92 (1992), 1-13, esp. 11-12 and n. 20; Jaritz and Bickel, BIFAO 94 (1994), 277-85, esp. 284-85. 2 E.g., a statue of Amen-Re, Cairo JdE 38689, now in Luxor ( The Luxor Museum of Ancient Egyptian Art Catalogue [Cairo, 1979], cat. no. 183) and a head of the god also in</page><page sequence="6">118 JARCE XXXVI (1999) It is hard to determine the full scope of Tut- ankhamen's work on the standing monuments because he seldom marked his repairs with smjwy- mnw inscriptions. The few examples known often refer to Amenhotep III rather than Amen-Re as the beneficiary.30 They often mark completions of Amenhotep III unfinished monuments rather than actual repairs to mutilated reliefs. Such inscriptions were one of the ways Tutankhamen sought to associate himself with his grandfather.31 Still, blocks from the gateway of a granary of Amenhotep III from Karnak do include at least one renewal text describing Tutankhamen's ac- tivity on behalf of Amen-Re himself and it coin- cides with repaired images of the deity.32 His restoration of this granary, the Third Pylon at Karnak and blocks from Amenhotep Ill's memo- rial temple indicate that restoration of his grand- father's monuments was, in fact, a high priority for Tutankhamen.33 Unfortunately, given the paucity of renewal texts naming Tutankhamen, it is difficult to es- tablish with certainty which monuments he had initially restored. Still, one expects that he would have patched up a great number of reliefs during his nine year reign, including those in the main sanctuaries of the principal temples at Thebes and along their main processional routes. In two of the examples cited above, the Eighth Pylon reliefs and those from the memorial temple of Amenhotep III, we may extrapolate that Tut- ankhamen was responsible for restoring adjacent reliefs that bear no trace of his name. Thus it seems likely that Tutankhamen restored all the reliefs on the Eighth Pylon and others from Amenhotep Ill's memorial temple. One way to test this hypothesis would be to examine them for Fig. 3. Recut figure of Amen-Re above a smBwy-mnw inscrip- tion of Ay. The god's image has been enlarged somewhat.

A Secondary Restoration of Ay The earliest example of a secondary restora- tion in the post-Amarna era dates to the reign of Ay, and it is the only one of any kind that can be ascribed to him with certainty. It is found in the temple of Luxor on the jambs of the south doorway of the eighth pillared porch leading into the four columned hypostyle hall (figs. 3-5). 34 The jambs of the gateway are decorated with scenes of Amenhotep III offering to Amen-Re. At the base of each jamb is a bandeau text giv- Luxor (ibid., cat. no. 203). Two colossi of Amen and Amenet at Karnak were also the work of Tutankhamen (E. R. Russ- mann, Egyptian Sculpture: Cairo and Luxor [Austin, 1989], 132- 35), and a statue of Khonsu also from Karnak (ibid., Russ- mann, 130-32). A number of these were inscribed for Tutankhamen and later usurped by Horemheb. 30 See note 10. 31 As in the Colonnade Hall at Luxor temple. See W. R.

Ay's ban- deau texts appear to be originals, as there is no evidence he usurped them from Tutankhamen. Moreover, Horemheb never suppressed Ay's titu- lary, as one would expect.36 It is likely, then, that Ay is responsible for the final appearance of the gateway as he claims in these texts. Fig 5. Here Amen-Re's torso, arms and legs were augmented without making the figure taller. Below is a second badly damaged smDwy-mnw text of Ay. West jamb, bottom register. PM II2, 321 (124b). There is a striking difference between restored reliefs on the adjacent wall surfaces of the porch and those on the jambs of the south doorway; each of the Amen figures on the doorway has been extensively recut in comparison with the almost complete lack of such modifications on the adjacent wall surfaces. Ay's revisions are not the sort of "cosmetic" retouching occasionally found in reliefs,37 but rather, wholesale trans- formation of the Amen figures done to enlarge them substantially. 35 Urk.

These changes are most dramatic on the mid- dle register of the east jamb where vestiges of Amen's original chin and the base of his beard are embedded in the final shoulder while part of the bridge of the nose and inner canthus of the eye from the first edition lies below and to the right of the nostril of the final nose (fig. 4) . Sim- ilar adjustments to his face were made in the other tableaux on the gateway (fig. 3). Further modifications were made to their arms, legs, chests, the hems of their kilts, belts, modius crowns and plumes (cf. figs. 3 and 5). From all this, it is apparent that Ay entirely re- worked these icons to make them appear larger, and that he added two renewal texts at the base of the jambs, where none had existed before, to publicize his efforts. The lack of vestigial hack- ing around the Amen figures and the fact that the earlier versions of these were smaller than those of Amenhotep III which they face, all sug- gest that - like the revised icons on the south face of the Karnak Sixth Pylon - they represent an earlier restoration of the gateway by Tut- ankhamen and not the original reliefs of Amen- hotep III vandalized by Akhenaten. No other renewal texts of Ay are known, so it is unclear whether he was responsible for any other restorations, primary or secondary. The only other mention of the condition of the tem- ples in his time comes from a text in his speos at Akhmim which may not refer to restorations at all.38 Ay was not concerned with suppressing Tutankhamen's memory. Indeed, he consistently associated himself with his dead predecessor as a touchstone for his own legitimacy.39 The fact that he did not suppress an earlier restoration text of Tutankhamen would tend to confirm this. Secondary Restorations of Horemheb Under Horemheb, alterations to Tutankh- amen's repairs became more frequent, and the motive was clearly damnatio memoriae. The hall- mark of his revisionist program was the usur- pation of Tutankhamen's titulary on all the standing monuments, a practice that extended to renewal texts such as those on the east face of the Sixth Pylon at Karnak (figs. 1-2). Since Tutankhamen rarely used the smjwy-mnw resto- ration formula, however, such examples are few and far between. As described above, Horem- heb's secondary restorations on the Sixth Pylon are similar to Ay's on the south gate of the Luxor temple porch. In both cases, the renovated di- vine figures have been extensively recut. Unlike Ay's modifications, however, Horemheb always chose to modify reliefs in which Tutankhamen was explicitly named. On a wall opposite the southwest corner of the barque sanctuary of Philip Arrhidaeus at Karnak there is another example of a secondary resto- ration of Amen-Re's image similar to that on the east face of the Sixth Pylon (fig. 6).40 Here, how- ever, the phrase smjwy-mnw is missing, though a damaged marginal text inserted behind the god's figure mentioning the "[Gr]eat Mansion [of his [fa]ther Amen-Re Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, preeminent in Karnak, that he might make a 'given life'" is, perhaps, the end of just such a renewal formula. The standing figure of Amen-Re displays the same wholesale recutting associated with examples from the Sixth Pylon and from the porch at Luxor temple; the sculptor has raised the level of its shoulders and neck line, and increased the bulk of the figure by thicken- ing the width of the torso, forward leg and for- ward arm. Its rear portions were not reworked. Like the Sixth Pylon examples, little evidence of Amarna hacking remains. 38 Urk. IV, 2107:1-3: Murnane, Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt, 225. The statement is quite vague with regard to restoration work. The key term is smnh rather than smjwy. On this monument see K. P. Kuhlmann, "Der Felstempel des Eje bei Achmim," MDAIK35 (1979), 165-88 and pls. 48-56. The term smiwy (Wb. IV, 126) clearly means "to make new" and is commonly used to describe repairs made to damaged monuments. In building inscriptions, smnh (Wb. IV, 137) is used to describe the embellishment of existing monuments (e.g., Urk. IV, 102:2) and the repair of damaged ones (e.g., Urk. IV, 501:10). E.g., his completion of the "Mansion of Nebkhepurure in Thebes," a temple of Tutankhamen (O. Schaden, NARCE 127 [Fall, 1984], 44-64), and the "opening of the mouth" scene from the burial chamber of Tutankhamen's tomb. 40 Located at Nelson, Key Plans, KD 191.

The wholesale recutting and enlargement of the icon is nearly identical to adjustments made by Horemheb to reliefs on the Sixth Pylon. Nelson, Key Plans, KD 191. Horemheb did not limit such revisions to in- stances where a smjwy-mnw text could be found. He also altered restorations where Tutankha- men's protocol or the figure of the king himself appeared in other contexts. For example, on the east face of the north tower of the Third Pylon at Karnak there is a large scene depicting the waterborne festival procession of Opet carved by Amenhotep III.41 Murnane has argued persua- sively that two small figures of a king standing behind larger ones of Amenhotep III on the deck of Amen-Re 's great river barge, which were subsequently erased, were those of Tutankha- men - and not Akhenaten - and that they were suppressed by Horemheb. Tutankhamen's inser- tion of his own figure into the river procession scene is consistent with his tendency to associate himself with Amenhotep III. Horemheb made further modifications to the decoration on the Third Pylon heretofore undetected. Along the hull of the Amen Userhet barge we can see a series of ritual vignettes rendered in bas relief (fig. 7) . These correspond to large plates of gold em- bossed with similar tableaux with which Amen- hotep III clad the sides of the actual vessel.42 The scenes are executed in bas relief, in conformity with the general rule that details inside a sunk relief are raised. Little evidence of mutilation remains, nor do the divine figures lie on a more deeply cut back surface than the rest of the re- liefs. There are places where both the figures of the king and Amen-Re have been hacked, es- pecially on their faces, arms and legs, but these are consistent with defacement visited on many Theban monuments in post-antiquity. The scenes along the entire hull of the barque must have been restored by Tutankhamen in toto.^ All the more noteworthy, then, is the fact that the fig- ures of Amen in these vignettes consistently show recutting which augments their proportions, es- pecially along the fronts of their torsos, forward arms and legs and the leading edges of their plumed headdresses (fig. 7). These alterations are characteristic of other secondary restorations. Elsewhere at Karnak, Horemheb usurped still another relief that had been restored first by his predecessor.

Moreover, the flatness of these reliefs, typical of Tutankhamen's work, contrasts to the much deeper relief work of Amenhotep III which is characteristic of reliefs from the latest stage of his reign.

As Murnane has shown, the young king incorporated elements of his prenomen into the rebus decoration on the veil shrouding the cabin shrine, a practice common in the Ramesside pe- riod, but apparently not done before Tutankh- amen.44 Of these two scenes, Horemheb usurped only the western one by drastically altering the rebus decoration on the veil and the exposed upper portion of the cabin shrine to display a rebus of his own nomen. Inexplicably, he left the eastern scene alone,45 although it was later sup- planted by Seti I. He made no other changes to any of the reliefs on the pylon. Since Horemheb had suppressed Tutankh- amen's prenomen, his alteration of the rebus decoration counts as a form of usurpation. Like- wise, in the Colonnade Hall at Luxor, Horemheb appropriated similar rebus decoration on the canopies of the sacred barque of Amen-Re in the Opet reliefs. The alteration of the Eighth Pylon relief qualifies as a secondary restoration, how- ever, inasmuch as the image of the barque itself had previously been restored by Tutankhamen. Similar revisions were also made to a now frag- mentary barque scene reconstructed on paper by Johnson, originally from the east interior wall of the solar court of Luxor temple.46 Johnson's preliminary drawing shows a rebus of Horem- heb's nomen worked into the decoration of the cabin shrine along with a smjwy-mnw text nam- ing Seti I, of which we shall speak later. Accord- ing to Johnson, vestiges of a suppressed rebus of Tutankhamen's prenomen were evident on the inscribed fragments, but they could not be represented at the small scale of the published drawing.47 From the above, it seems that in removing all evidence of Tutankhamen from the monumen- tal record, Horemheb did not spare his prede- cessor's restorations where the young king's protocol appeared in smjwy-mnw texts nor when it took the form of rebus decoration on the can- opy of Amen-Re 's barque. Closely associated with his usurpation of renewal texts are instances where the divine figure has also been modified, sometimes to enlarge it. Still, Horemheb's sec- ondary restorations are quite limited in number 44 Murnane, MU, 67-68. Ibid., 60-61.

Nor were all Horem- heb's restorations secondary ones. He also seems to have made some initial restorations and occa- sionally added renewal texts, as in the peristyle colonnade surrounding the barque sanctuary at the Eighteenth Dynasty temple at Medinet Habu.48 But here, the divine figures show no evidence of recutting, and the smjwy-mnw texts are originals.49 Secondary Restorations of Seti I The present author's interest in this subject arose from a doctoral thesis on the monuments of Seti I.50 Seti is well known as a pious restorer of desecrated monuments because he frequently labeled them with smjwy-mnw formulae,51 the sort of text that had been used only haphazardly and in variant forms by his three late Eighteenth Dynasty predecessors. Seti now standardized the formula and used it more frequently than had Tutankhamen, Ay and Horemheb combined (cf. figs. 9, 20-21). As suggested earlier, it seems highly unlikely that large numbers of monu- ments in the most conspicuous and important venues, such as the main processional routes at Karnak, were first restored by Seti given that for two to three decades preceding his accession the last kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty were themselves engaged in widespread repairs of the monuments. A close epigraphic investigation of Seti Fs restoration program reveals that the divine fig- ures in reliefs labeled with smjwy-mnw texts often exhibit drastic recutting (e.g., fig. 21), while others show no such alterations (fig. 9). Seti's program of restorations, both primary and secondary, is quite large and a comprehensive study of them has been made in the present author's dissertation. Like those of Ay and Horemheb, Seti Fs sec- ondary restorations are largely, if not wholly, a Theban phenomenon. This is due in part to accidents of preservation, but it is also true that outside of the Thebaid, reliefs depicting deities other than the Theban triad were often left un- molested in the Amarna period,52 although the name and image of Amen-Re was vandalized wherever it occurred. There is a typical secondary restoration of Seti I to be seen on the southeast corner of the north tower of the Fourth Pylon at Karnak.53 This sunk relief tableau preserves the lower torso and legs of a goddess sitting on a throne with a minor deity, who is male, standing behind her holding a tray (fig. 8) . The rounded proportions of the goddesses's thighs and legs are typical of the post-Amarna style of art. Both figures have been altered subsequent to their initial repair. Traces of an earlier version of the goddess' but- tocks extend along the base of the throne to the small of her back. Likewise her arm and the back of her throne have also been reworked. Few remnants of Amarna hacking remain on the goddess' figure. By contrast, extensive hacking remains on the smaller one, which was not modi- fied as extensively as she was. This pattern of recutting is consistent with two separate resto- rations, with the most extensively reworked por- tions of the relief having considerably fewer traces of Amarna vandalism. The primary renewal relied heavily on plaster to mask the deepest hacking, and the same mate- rial would have been used in the final version more to hide the suppressed cut lines of the first.

Like most of Seti's renewal texts associated with secondary restora- tions, it is an original and not a usurpation of a predecessor's.54 This example is typical of almost all known secondary restorations in that such adjustments were most commonly made to reliefs carved in softer media like limestone and sandstone. By contrast, there is a paucity of good examples in hard stone like granite. Egyptian sculptors used differing methods to repair reliefs in hard and soft stones.55 They often employed paint and plaster to mask both vestiges of hacking and evi- dence of secondary alterations when repairing soft stone reliefs, but this was not an option in mending granite and other hard media, where paint was typically used, but only sparingly, to highlight certain details, and where plaster was never used.56 Moreover the pattern of mutilation that is observable in unrestored hard stone re- liefs differs sharply from hacking to softer media. Granite reliefs were chipped or pecked away, and the damage rarely penetrated the original surface any deeper than the relief's cut lines. As a result, the sculptor had only to shave down the surface a little further than the depth of the original relief to remove all traces of it and the icono- clast's chisel. Consequently, secondary restora- tions of hard stone reliefs leave few if any traces and are difficult to detect, and few have been identified with confidence.57 A series of tableaux on a granite doorway lying between the Fifth and Sixth Pylons at Karnak 54 An exception are cartouches of Tutankhamen usurped by Seti from restoration texts in the memorial temple of Amenhotep III in western Thebes, found reused in the me- morial temple of Merenptah.

In the handful of examples where recutting occurs on granite reliefs restored by Seti I, the earlier version often seems to correspond to the pre-Amarna original. E.g., Cairo JdE 86763, the Memphite historical stela of Amenhotep II. Recutting is observable on the figures of Amen-Re and Ptah, but also on the left hand figure of the king. See E. Edel, "Die Stelen Amenophis' II aus Karnak und Memphis mit dem Bericht iiber die asiatischen Feldziige des Konigs," ZDPV 69 (1953), pl. 3. It is apparent that the entire surface of the lu- nette was shaved down and redone.

PM II2, 86 (223). may represent an exceptional secondary restora- tion in hard stone.58 The west face of its jambs bore at least three registers of scenes depicting Thutmose III accompanied by another deity be- fore Amen-Re (fig. 9). Renewal texts on the lower registers are Seti Fs and bear no signs that they are anything but originals. There are no vestiges of either iconoclast gouging or of recutting, and the depression in which the Amen figures lie has been so skillfully made that it is practically unde- tectable without close inspection. Thus there is no epigraphic data, such as recutting, to suggest that Seti was not the first to restore this gateway. Yet the restored images of Amen-Re are ren- dered in a style consistent with reliefs of Tut- ankhamen, and are unlike any of the facial types known for Seti I. It seems likely, then, that Seti merely added his two renewal texts to this door- way without making any further alterations. The problem of secondary restorations of hard stone monuments remains a thorny one, and the preceding example seems to be an aberration from the normal pattern of Seti's work in any case. Moreover, there are over a dozen stelae made from granite and other hard stones clearly inscribed with smjivy-mnw formulae of Seti I that lack any sign of either recutting or usurpation. It is hard to explain, however, why so many im- portant stelae would have been left unrepaired in the years during which the post-Amarna kings reigned. Still, it may be that secondary restorations were almost always made to soft stone reliefs. One of the largest examples of this practice under Seti I is the Eighth Pylon at Karnak.59 As noted earlier, two barque scenes restored by Tutankhamen were later usurped by Horemheb, on the west tower, while Seti I usurped the east one.60 Except for a series of tableaux later added by Ramesses III to the lower half of the west tower, all the decora- tion on the north face and the two small Amen figures from a pair of smiting scenes of Amenho- tep II on the south face, were restored by Seti I (fig. 18). 61 We find his name in several renewal texts, including two extended speeches put into the mouth of Amen-Re in a pair of large offer- ing scenes on the east tower (figs. 10 and 17).62 There is no evidence that he usurped the car- touches in the renewal formulae that occur in nearly every scene he restored. (Warsaw, 1976), fig. 100. Since the royal image would not have been damaged, it is not clear if the recutting evident on the two divine figures corresponds to an earlier restoration or to the Thutmoside original. A similar case is the Ptah tem- ple stela of Thutmose III from Karnak, CG 34013, where faint traces of both the earlier Ptah figures and the king's on the right hand side persist despite having been erased. 58 PMII2, 86 (223-24); Nelson, Key Plans, KC 145-46, 48. 59 Location: PM II2, 174-75 (517-19); Nelson, Key Plans KG 102-13. 60 Murnane, VAX, 59-66. 61 Location: PM II2, 175-76 (521-22); Nelson, Key Plans KG 143 and 145. 62 For the text at KG 103 see KRIl, 228:14-15.</page><page sequence="14">126 JARCE XXXVI (1999) Fig. 10.

Seti also replaced several of the original Eigh- teenth Dynasty figures of the king in a number of scenes and substituted his cartouches with those of Thutmose I and II (figs. 10 and 17).63 Stylistically, these figures differ markedly from the two Eighteenth Dynasty representations of Thutmose I which were left alone (fig. II).64 It is clear from these substitutions that Seti made more comprehensive changes to the decorative program of the Eighth Pylon than merely restor- ing the divine figures and adding a handful of sniDwy-mnw texts.

A close inspection of the restored divinities on the pylon turns up evidence of the wholesale re- cutting of most of them on both faces of the building. Two large Amen figures on the north face of the east tower are typical. The angle of the god's plumes has been changed so that they rise more steeply (fig. 12). The figures themselves have been shifted to the left somewhat in both in- stances and traces of the earlier profile can be made out although these have been masked with plaster (cf. figs. 13 and 14). Recutting is also vis- ible along the god's limbs and on the ribbon dan- gling from his modius crown (cf. figs. 14-15). Clearly, plaster was used extensively to patch Fig. 13.

Plaster has even been used to mold a new outer cut line for the deep sunk relief around the god's limbs, where the stone edge had become broken and irregular as a result of vandalism to and multiple restorations of these icons (cf. figs. 14-15) . Similar recutting occurs with most of the deities on the pylon, including those in the two Ennead scenes at the far left side of the east tower behind the two large Amen figures (fig. 16). Only Atum was spared by the Amarna iconoclasts, all the other members of the Ennead having been vandalized and extensively recut.

A number of epigraphic features indicate, how- ever, that the two versions both postdate Akhen- aten for the following reasons. (1) Although there are extensive traces of what must have been severe hacking around nearly every divine image, there are generally no indications that the cut lines of the earlier version of these figures were interrupted by such gouges (fig. 18). In the case of the two large Amen figures on the outer wing of the east tower in particular, there is no sign of disfigurement Fig. 15. Fist of Amen-Re holding an cnh. Remnants of an earlier restoration of the arm were patched with plaster. Eighth Pylon, north face, east tower, bottom. PMIf, 174 (518). of the face and plumes of the primary edition (fig. 10). Given the tendency for iconoclasts to exercise considerable zeal in defacing these di- vine attributes elsewhere (cf. figs. 20 and 22), it is noteworthy that no signs of hacking can be made out here. The area of remnant hacking extends several inches to the right of the earlier figures, which suggests that the Eighteenth Dy- nasty original lay further to the right as well. In fact, broken segments of the cut line of an arm and shoulder survive on the outer edge of this gouged area a few inches to the right of the two later versions (fig. 14). These lines are much shallower and at a higher level than the two later editions, and must be Thutmoside in date. Thus there are actually three separate versions of this relief, and the final one must be Seti Fs emenda- tion of Tutankhamen's restoration.</page><page sequence="17">SECONDARY RESTORATIONS IN THE POST-AMARNA PERIOD 129 Fig. 16.

Eighth Pylon, south face, west tower. PM II2, 176 (522). (2) At some point after the original decora- tion on the Eighth Pylon had been finished, Thutmose III converted the space between the Seventh and Eighth pylons into a courtyard by adding side walls. The eastern wall covered the outer edge of the east tower, partially blocking the reliefs on the two bottom subregisters of the lower Ennead scene (fig. 16). The upper portion of this wall is now missing, but an engraved guide- line delineates its original batter. On the lowest subregisters, a figure of Qebekhsenuef has been hacked out and restored, but the back of his head, once blocked by the wall, and now partially exposed, was never vandalized. (3) The same is true of Nemty's image at the far left edge of the subregister immediately above (fig. 16). Here, the left side of the original ver- sion, also formerly covered by the wall, is like- wise intact. Where the front of the figure should be, there are only remnants of hacking, and an entirely new figure was carved somewhat to the right of this damaged area. This restoration exhibits the same recutting we find on all the others. Here again there is evidence for three separate versions, pointing to a secondary resto- ration. Thus it seems certain that Tutankhamen was responsible for the primary restoration of the Eighth Pylon reliefs. (4) Although the renewal texts of Seti I on the Eighth Pylon are originals, the two extended speeches of Amen in the large offering scenes on the east tower have a more complicated his- tory.65 In these texts, the god thanks Seti for his repair efforts. It is clear from their content that they date to the post-Amarna era. Stray traces of an erased Urtext belonging to an Eighteenth Dy- nasty di cnh formula persist, mostly in the area above and behind Amen's plumes (figs. 10 and 12). The royal cartouches in both texts bear no sign of usurpation, so it would appear that Seti was responsible for their composition after he carefully erased the earlier inscription. By con- trast, the name and epithets of Amen-Re have been entirely recut. The background surface, pristine around most of the text, exhibits vestigial gouging by the iconoclast's chisel in the areas where the divine protocol lies (figs. 10 and 17). Thus it seems Tutankhamen restored the god's damaged titulary just as he did his figure, but that no other portion of the Thutmoside caption texts had been vandalized and so they were left alone until Seti I reworked the entire scene, re- cutting not only the divine figures, but replac- ing the caption texts with ones lauding his own restoration efforts and substituting the original Thutmoside portrait of the king with his own. Just as he revised Amen's image, so he altered Tutankhamen's restoration of the god's protocol. The question remains, if Seti's motive for al- tering Tutankhamen's restoration of the pylon was not to usurp the latter's titulary - by contrast with the apparent raison d'etre for Horemheb's 65 Location: Nelson, Key Plans KG 102 and 103; KRI I, 228:14-15.</page><page sequence="19">SECONDARY RESTORATIONS IN THE POST-AMARNA PERIOD 131 secondary restorations - what was? The answer may lie in those few divine figures on the pylon which were not modified by Seti. These include depictions of Thoth and Monthu, and two repre- sentations of the goddess Weret-hekau (fig. 11). All four had been restored by Tutankhamen, but they lack the extensive recutting that are hall- marks of Seti's workmanship. The only other thing they have in common, which further dis- tinguishes them from reliefs retouched by Seti, is that they are animal headed. It may be that the post-Amarna style of the primary restora- tions of the anthropomorphic deities were ob- jectionable to Seti because they bore the likeness of the now discredited Tutankhamen. Horem- heb, by contrast, did not alter the portraits of Tutankhamen in reliefs where he usurped the latter's titulary, but then he also employed a sim- ilar post-Amarna style in his reliefs and sculp- ture. Moreover, because of the thoroughness with which Horemheb had usurped Tutankh- amen's protocol on the monuments, reliefs bear- ing the likeness of the young king were practically the only visible reminder of his tenure left on the monuments when Seti came to the throne. Further secondary restorations of Seti I can be found on a number of other Theban monu- ments. In the courtyard of the Ninth and Tenth Pylons, the divine icons on pillars of the Edifice of Amenhotep II were restored by Tutankhamen while the building was still in its original location in the vicinity of the Eighth Pylon. After it had been dismantled and re-erected by Horemheb in its present location,66 Seti I added new reliefs to the rebuilt wall surfaces, and reworked the di- vine images on the pillars (figs. 19-20). He also added four sntDwy-mnw texts on pillars facing the main axis of the building (fig. 20). 67 As noted earlier, he also usurped renewal texts of Tutankh- amen and recut figures of Amen-Re on blocks from the memorial temple of Amenhotep III which were later reused by Merenptah in his memorial temple.68 Seti made other secondary restorations to the decoration of the solar court and adjoining Fig. 19.

Few of the sun court reliefs are now intact, but a renewal text of the king on a scene from the north wall, and widespread instances of re- cutting on the preserved legs and lower torsos of the divine images on the east wall, indicate that he was active here. A fragmentary barque scene of Amenhotep III from the solar court, which Johnson has reconstructed, bears a smiwy- mnw formula with Seti's cartouche.69 As men- tioned earlier, Horemheb had usurped the rebus decoration on the canopy from Tutankhamen. 66 C.

Without exception, every one of the divine fig- ures on the wall has been recut. This typically involved adjustments to the proportions of the figures (figs. 21-23). The hacking observable on the limbs and faces of the royal and divine images we can see today on the lower registers dates to the Coptic period, as indicated by a number of Coptic crosses engraved in some of the tableaux, but Seti had added several smiwy-mnw texts on the two lower registers of the wall, and again, there is no indication that they were usurped from an earlier king (fig. 21). Outside of Thebes, 70 Seti made similar adjustments to the proportion of the barque in the scene on the east tower of the Eighth Pylon which he usurped from Tutankhamen, whereas the western one, usurped by Horemheb, retains its original form. Like- wise in the Colonnade Hall at Luxor, Seti enlarged the pro- portions of the barque when he converted a cartoon laid out by Tutankhamen into relief.

The only examples of the phenomenon known at this time are a handful of recut figures of Amen-Re in the Eighteenth Dynasty temple at Amada.72 Conclusions From the foregoing analysis, it seems clear that the recutting we find on a large number of divine images in reliefs restored during the post- Amarna era marks them as secondary restora- tions altered by one of Tutankhamen's immediate predecessors. In every case, the modification of divine figures is associated with the titulary of Ay, Horemheb or Seti I. Horemheb's revisions, in particular, coincide with his usurpation of his 2 A number of Amen figures were entirely recut, one of these having been shifted backwards.

Under Seti I, such appro- priations are less common, although he always marked his own secondary restorations with smjwy-mnw inscriptions. It is, of course, possible that subsequent alter- ations to certain reliefs first restored by Tutankha- men are not linked to Horemheb's usurpation of his cartouches on these reliefs, but are solely the work of Seti I.73 This, however, seems un- likely. The present author is unaware of any ex- amples of secondary restoration in which a renewal text or some other mark of the restoring king's hand does not appear in the restored tab- leaux or, at least, in an adjacent vignette. This coincidence of the recutting of these icons with the name of a revisionist pharaoh seems hard to escape. In fact, despite the rather limited num- ber of examples attested for Ay and Horemheb, a pattern in the historical development of this phenomenon can be detected. Moreover, there is no connection between any of these secondary restorations and the revisions made by Seti I to his own reliefs, such as those on the north wall of the Karnak Hypostyle Hall which were made for entirely different reasons. The one secondary restoration of Ay differs from all subsequent ones in that his motive was not to take credit for the repair away from Tut- ankhamen. On the contrary, Ay often associated himself with his predecessor in an effort to stress his own legitimacy. Thus his modifications to re- stored reliefs on the south gateway of the Luxor temple porch accompanied by two new renewal inscriptions are rare manifestations of his claim to have participated in the orthodox reestab- lishment of Amen-Re's temples. By contrast, every one of Horemheb's second- ary restorations coincides with his supplanting Tutankhamen's protocol on the reliefs. That his motive was damnatio memoriae is evident given the fact that the handful of his original renewal in- scriptions occur in reliefs which exhibit no indi- cation of secondary recutting of the restored divine image. By ordering alterations to previously repaired monuments, Seti I was following Horemheb's lead, but on a much larger scale. Unlike his pre- decessor, Seti modified reliefs that generally lacked renewal texts of Tutankhamen. By this time, Horemheb's program of damnatio memoriae had practically eliminated any mention of Tut- ankhamen. Presumably it was the resemblance these anthropomorphic representations of the gods bore to the now discredited sovereign that were considered objectionable by Seti. Support- ing this hypothesis is the fact that several ani- mal headed deities were not modified alongside anthropomorphic figures which were. Tutankh- amen served as a convenient straw man for the new ruler to demonstrate his orthodoxy when his new royal house was scarcely two years old. In taking the damnatio memoriae of Tutankhamen to its utmost end he brought the post-Amarna era to a close.
