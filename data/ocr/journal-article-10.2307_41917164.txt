<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jessica's Turquoise Ring and Abigail's Poisoned Porridge: Shakespeare and IS/larlowe as Rivals and Imitators MAURICE CHARNEY Christopher 1564, and William Marlowe Shakespeare was baptized was baptized at Canterbury at Stratford on February on April 26, 1564, and William Shakespeare was baptized at Stratford on April 26, 1564, thus beginning one of the most intriguing rivalries in the annals of English literature. By the time Marlowe was killed in a tavern brawl at Deptford on May 30, 1593, his accomplishments at age 29 were considerably greater than those of Shakespeare at age 29. Had Shakespeare died in the same year, our literary history of Elizabethan drama would need to be radically revised, with Shakespeare among the lesser dramatists like Greene and Peele. Shakespeare not only outperformed his contem- poraries, but also outlived most of them. It is not entirely conjectural, therefore, to see Shakespeare in 1593 laboring under the anxiety of influence exerted by Marlowe, his more famous, more energetic, more brilliant, and more personally exciting coeval. Marlowe is the "Dead shepherd" of Phebe's couplet in As You Like It: A shorter version of this paper was presented to the Drama Division of the Modern Language Association in December 1977. 33</page><page sequence="2">34 MAURICE CHARNEY Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, "Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?" (III.v.81-82)1 And Marlowe is constantly erupting in allusive and parodie fashion in Shakespeare's early plays. As Nicholas Brooke puts it: "There are a number of eruptions in Shakespeare's work of passages which are unmis- takably Marlovian in tone and attitude, to a degree which would almost justify a disintegrator in identifying them as Marlowe's work."2 Marlowe may perhaps be the Rival Poet of the Sonnets, who keeps Shakespeare's "ripe thoughts" from coming to fruition by "the proud full sail of his great verse," and who, by writing "Above a mortal pitch," strikes Shakespeare dead. Shakespeare calls up his own truth and strength of devotion - perhaps only a "worthless boat" after all - against his rival's great rhetorical pinnace "of tall building, and of goodly pride." Whether or not he is literally invoking Marlowe, Marlowe was, as F. P. Wilson claims, "the only man of Shakespeare's age who could have been a rival poet."3 Shakespeare's nervous verses show a marked sense of diffidence and inferiority to Marlowe's "mighty line"; it is as if Shakespeare felt that it was hopeless ever to try to match him. If we confine our perspective to The Jew of Malta and The Merchant of Venice , we can speculate within a narrower range about how Shakespeare tried not to compete with Marlowe in his own excellences, but to convert him into a less heroic and more complex mode. The Jew of Malta , from around 1590, became a great hit of the Admiral's Men, the chief rival to Shakespeare's company, with Edward Alley n as Barabas. The Merchant of Venice , from about 1596, draws directly on Marlowe's Jew-play for the action in Venice.4 Shakespeare undoubtedly studied his rival's play in i .

It is also likely that he saw it performed. The transformation of Marlowe is profound, yet the indebtedness is still deep. There are other ways of phrasing this relation. Marlowe influenced Shakespeare, but Shakespeare also recoiled from that influence. It is everywhere apparent that Shakespeare thought The Jew of Malta. an in- adequate play, weak and inconsistent in characterization and deprived of those richly ambiguous touches of psychological truth that make The Merchant of Venice so compelling. Yet Shakespeare's play, at least in the Shy lock action, is surprisingly close in spirit to its source in The Jew of Malta. It is as if Shakespeare were trying to conceal the intensity of his own indebtedness to Marlowe, as if he were trying to prove that, although he could not rival Marlowe on his own ground, he could explore areas of dramatic awareness in which Marlowe would never dare to venture. The title of this paper, "Jessica's Turquoise Ring and Abigail's Poisoned Porridge," is not entirely frivolous, because, even though it is difficult to compare turquoise rings and poisoned porridge, the two daughters have an analogous function. Jessica is clearly modeled on Abigail. Both are motherless daughters, like Ophelia and the daughters of King Lear. The absence of the mother strengthens the bond with the father, and there is a curiously incestuous scene in The Jew of Malta , in which Barabas, with the aid of Abigail, has just recovered his treasure from the nunnery in which Abigail has falsely immured herself. The exhilarated Barabas speaks in a style that strongly anticipates the wooing of Romeo and Juliet: But stay! what star shines yonder in the east? The lodestar of my life, if Abigail. (II.i.41-42)5 Before Abigail exits above, her father closes with her in an exuberantly romantic style very different from the heavy paternalism of Shy lock, Polonius, and Lear: Farewell, my joy, and by my fingers take A kiss from him that sends it from his soul. (II.i.58-59) 5. The Jew of Malta is quoted from the edition by Richard W. Van Fossen in the Regents Renaissance Drama series (Lincoln, Nebr. , 1964).</page><page sequence="4">3 6 MAURICE CHARNEY The exclamation of Barabas links his ducats and his daughter in a context that is celebratory: "O girl, O gold, O beauty, O my bliss! Hugs his bags " (II.i.54). With Shylock the association is grotesque and melodramatic, as in Solanio's malicious report: "My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats! Justice! The law! My ducats and my daughter!" (II. viii. 15- 17) Solanio revels in the sexual implication of "two stones, two rich and precious stones, / Stol'n by my daughter!" (II. viii. 20-21), as if Shylock were speaking directly about the "family jewels" - "stones" is a standard Elizabethan word for testicles. Jessica has symbolically emasculated her old father, while Abigail has filled Barabas full of lusty, incestuous vital- ity. Admittedly, the passages are from different parts of the action, but they still use the same symbolic means to produce opposite effects. This is characteristic of Shakespeare's attempt to thoroughly revamp his old script. Abigail and Jessica both enact the folk-tale role of the ogre's daughter: "the story of a girl who betrays her own inhuman father, sometimes letting him be killed, always permitting the stealing of his treasure - and all for the sake of a human hero, with whom she afterward tries to flee back to his world."6 The archetype does not fit the dramatic characters as well as Leslie Fiedler would have us believe, yet we are grateful to him for his subterranean exploration of The Merchant of Venice. As fair Christians, Abigail and Jessica redeem the sins of their dark and villainous fathers. They do not, of course, succeed in converting their unrepentant ogre- fathers, but they manage to separate themselves from their own tainted origins. Here the absence of the mother simplifies the dichotomy. The desertion of the daughters isolates the fathers and sets them up as the villain-scapegoats of a corrupt, money-dominated society. The dynamics of The Jew of Malta and The Merchant of Venice correspond with surprising closeness. Both Barabas and Shylock react with anguish to their daughters' betrayal. There is never any objection to the daughters' Christianity on theological grounds; the issue is never pursued doctrinally 6. Leslie A. Fiedler, The Stranger in Shakespeare (London, 1972), p. in.</page><page sequence="5">Shakespeare and Marlowe as Rivals and Imitators 37 or ideologically. It is simply the revolt of the daughter against a hard but loving father - "How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is / To have a thankless child" (I.iv. 295-296), as Lear puts it with more than fatherly exigence. The disloyalty cuts deep and feeds, especially in Shylock, a monomaniacal rage. It is the biological shock of separation. In The Jew of Malta , the ogre's daughter does not immediately reveal her darker purpose, but first delights her father with the ingenious recov- ery of his treasure. We know, however, that this optimistic mood cannot last. Abigail refuses to be a party to the Machiavellian games of Barabas and Ithamore - and the Turkish slave bought in the market place soon replaces her, both figuratively and literally, as Barabas's adopted son. After the murder of Lodowick and Don Mathias, Abigail abjures her father, "Hard-hearted father, unkind Barabas," in an important soliloquy: But I perceive there is no love on earth, Pity in Jews, nor piety in Turks. (III. iii. 47-48) When Abigail becomes a nun again in good earnest, her father casts her off with cruel but logical arguments: "False and unkind! What, hast thou lost thy father?" (III.iv.2). Barabas correctly understands that the Catholic church is his rival and that his daughter has irretrievably abandoned him. In this hostile choice, she may actually be a threat to him for what she knows. Unlike Shylock, Barabas speaks of the loss of his daughter with a matter-of-fact, sardonic lucidity: For she that varies from me in belief Gives great presumption that she loves me not; Or loving, doth dislike of something done. (III. iv. 10-12) In a revenge tinged with incestuous overtones, Barabas, like old Abra- ham (the prototype of all "heavy" Jewish fathers), is now ready to slay his child. We have already had some alarming signs of this impending mur- der. In the smooth colloquy with Lodowick, Barabas says savagely (aside): "ere he shall have her, / I'll sacrifice her on a pile of wood" (II. iii. 52 - 5 3). This is uncomfortably close to the Abraham and Isaac story. There is also foreboding in Barabas's early declaration that he has only "one sole daugh- ter, whom I hold as dear / As Agamemnon did his Iphigen" (I.i.135-</page><page sequence="6">38 MAURICE CHARNEY 136). Like the Jeptha's daughter of Polonius ( Hamlet , II.ii.412- 42 1), this allusion is dire, since Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to get his fleet moving. Once Barabas curses his daughter, he proceeds to a witty expedient by which to rid himself not only of her, but also of a whole nunnery of his enemies. The comfortingly domestic pot of rice porridge that stands by the fire is cunningly "spiced" by Barabas and sent secretly as an alms offering to the nunnery on Saint Jacques' Even. Ithamore as villainous straightman makes his witty contribution: "Troth, master, I'm loath such a pot of pottage should be spoil'd" (III. iv. 84-85), which is in the mocking spirit of Barabas's delight in mass murder: There is no music to a Christian's knell. How sweet the bells ring now the nuns are dead That sound at other times like tinkers' pans! (IV. i . 1-3) This is a good example of the farcical energy celebrated by T. S. Eliot in his essay on Marlowe: "it is the farce of the old English humour, the terribly serious, even savage comic humour, the humour which spent its last breath in the decadent genius of Dickens."7 Abigail dies as an all-loving saint: Ah, gentle friar, Convert my father, that he may be sav'd, And witness that I die a Christian. (III. vi. 38-40) As surrogate for Barabas, Friar Barnardine undercuts the unctuous beatitudes: "Ay, and a virgin, too; that grieves me most" (III. vi. 41). Is this "savage comic humour," or is Barnardine merely an evil-minded wise guy in the style of Lucio in Measure for Measure ? In any case, Abigail's death has a curiously maternal aspect to it as her father offers the speci- ously comforting rice porridge - a dish often given to the sick. Marlowe seems to miss the implications of Abigail's death, since the rage of Barabas is so limited and so controlled, and the murder of his daughter is so unclimactically merged with a whole anonymous nunnery. 7.

Eliot, "Christopher Marlowe" (1918), in Selected, Essays 1917-1932 (New York, 1932), p. 105.</page><page sequence="7">Shakespeare and Marlowe as Rivals and Imitators 39 This is the very point on which Shakespeare puts such overwhelming emphasis. After the stealing away of Jessica- and her own self-indulgent stealing from her father's coffers - Shylock is enraged with an intensity of hate that can never be placated. The teasing, "merry" bond has disap- peared, and Shylock is now out for blood. Shy lock's passion in Act III, scene i, cannot be appeased, and the loss of his daughter marks the loss of everything that has made life meaningful for him in Venice. I don't mean this as a sentimental justification of the savage Shylock, but only as a way of understanding the new and literal viciousness of Act III, scene i. Shylock is suffering, and, in characteristic fashion, he wants to make sure that all those around him suffer more than he does. Shylock has sent to seek for his daughter, and in III. i Tubal gives his lacerating report of Jessica and Lorenzo on their frivolous honeymoon in Genoa. "Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night fourscore ducats" (III. i. 101- 102). The exact amounts and their modern equivalents are unimportant. Shylock is cut to the quick by his daughter's mindless extravagance: to him it translates what it means to be a Christian wife. The culminating insult is Tubal's report from a creditor of Antonio: "One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey" (11. iii- 112). We think of Othello's fulsome "Goats and monkeys" (IV. i. 263), both animals associated with lechery. "Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys" (III. iii. 400), as Iago has said before, and we remember that in Falstaff 's report, Justice Shallow was in his youth "lecherous as a monkey" (2 Henry /V, III. ii. 324). The monkey is a type image for the derogation of human decency, as in the railing Apemantus's conclusion: "The strain of man's bred out / Into baboon and monkey" ( Timon of Athens, I.i. 255-256). Jessica's monkey affronts her father's seri- ous, puritanic values - we are reminded that Jews and Puritans were closely associated in the minds of Shakespeare's audience as pharisaical believers in the literal word of the Old Testament. From Jessica's monkey we move back to Shylock's ring, which repre- sents the final, excruciating turn of the screw: Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. (Ill.i. 1 13- 1 16) For a moment, Jessica is no longer a motherless daughter. The mention of Leah, Shylock's deceased wife, evokes a human landscape that has long</page><page sequence="8">40 MAURICE CHARNEY since disappeared. That Shylock could have been a bachelor and a wooer and the receiver of a turquoise ring as a love token from his girl-friend Leah - all these humanizing details seem incredible at this moment. Turquoise is the semi-precious stone from Turkey - Ithamore's coun- try - usually spelled and pronounced "turkis" (or "turkie"). Its special property was to mirror the state of health and the mood of its wearer. Thus Donne, in his "First Anniversary," describes the stone "As a com- passionate Turcoyse which doth tell / By looking pale, the wearer is not well" (11. 343- 344). 8 In Jonson 's Sejanus , it is "true as turquoise in the dear lord's ring, / Look well or ill with him" (I. i. 37- 38). 9 The lapidary meaning gives the turquoise special significance as a reflector of the recip- rocal feelings of lovers. The point of Shylock's intense and almost hysteri- cal grief is that Jessica has desecrated her mother's ring (and therefore her mother's memory).10 The hyperbolic and commercial conclusion about the wilderness of monkeys is both grotesque and poignant. Shylock does not have at hand any easy terms by which to express his emotions. It is curious that Barabas has quantities of precious and . semi-precious stones - Bags of fiery opals, sapphires, amethysts, Jacinths, hard topaz, grass-green emeralds, Beauteous rubies, sparkling diamonds - (I. ii. 25-27) but no turquoise. It seems obvious that if all these splendid stones are heaped together in one grand hyperbole in Marlowe's play, then they are no longer available to Shakespeare, who has to turn to the humbler and more anthropomorphic turquoise. If this detail carries any conviction, then Shakespeare was also obliged to avoid many of the poetic felicities of The Jew of Malta. Barabas has a vaunting, heroic style, not unlike Tambur- 8.

See the animated moral attack on Jessica by Arthur Quiller-Couch in the introduc- tion to the New Cambridge edition of the play (Cambridge, Eng., 1926), pp. xx- xxi.

The Jew of Malta holds himself above ordinary, dull-witted mortals: No, Barabas is born to better chance, And fram'd of finer mold than common men, That measure naught but by the present time. A reaching thought will search his deepest wits, And cast with cunning for the time to come. . . . (I. ii. 218-222) The illusion is offered, almost from the beginning, that his wealth is the aesthetic product of his soaring imagination. In his most characteristic utterance, Shylock insists on his common humanity: Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affec- tions, passions? - fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? (III. i. 56-61) It would never occur to Barabas to rationalize his revenge in these humanistic terms; he is never put in a position where he needs to justify what he is doing, even to himself. This is hardly a comic speech, even if Shylock is dressed in the Jewish clown costume inherited from Judas: red wig, hooked putty nose, and long, loose-fitting gown or smock - his "Jewish gaberdine." Barabas has a much wider range, but Shylock is more intense. His crudeness of speech and manner - halting, inconsequential, wheedling, insistent, insinuating, menacing, irrelevant - is meant to characterize him as a Jew very different from the elegant, eloquent, and worldly Barabas. We are never allowed to feel that Barabas is desperate, wild, and frenzied as Shylock is, with his back to the wall and at bay in a totally hostile setting. By a nice paradox, although Barabas moves in a tragic action, he is thoroughly insulated from the tragic emotions that Shylock arouses in a play that is unquestionably a comedy. If Marlowe was indeed Shakespeare's rival poet, then the limits he set had a salutary effect on Shakespeare's development. There was no chance that the boy from Stratford, not even university trained, could match the boy from Canterbury's soaring and classically derived rhetoric. In an early</page><page sequence="10">42 MAURICE CHARNEY play like Titus Andronicus , for example, Shakespeare may have tried to out-Marlowe Marlowe. The splendid speeches, heavily indebted as they are to Ovid, resemble Tamburlaine and The Jew of Malta , too. There is no lack of persons with aspiring minds in Titus , and the insouciant Mach- iavellism of Aaron the Moor must be directly indebted to Ithamore and Barabas both. But Shakespeare moved away from grand rhetoric to a more difficult exploration of the details of character and consciousness. There is a certain flatness in Barabas that Shakespeare must have found disturbing. When Ithamore, for example, asks him: "Do you not sorrow for your daughter's death?" (IV.i.16), Barabas answers with energetic vitupera- tion, but his speech is disappointing because it lacks any psychological dimension: No, but I grieve because she liv'd so long. An Hebrew born, and would become a Christian! Cazzo! diabolo ! (IV.i. 17-19) " Cazzo ! diabolo /" is very un-Shakespearean and just on the edge of high- class, Italianate rant. Shylock's deviousness is an improvement on the plain-spoken villainy of Barabas. When the Duke importunes Shy lock to explain his murderous passion against Antonio, he sardonically refuses any answer: What if my house be troubled with a rat, And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned? What, are you answered yet? Some men there are love not a gaping pig, Some that are mad if they behold a cat, And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose, Cannot contain their urine. . . . (IV.i. 44-50) But there is a savage answer concealed in these insinuations that Bassiano presses out of Shylock: BASSANIO Do all men kill the things they do not love? SHYLOCK Hates any man the thing he would not kill? (IV.i. 65-66)</page><page sequence="11">Shakespeare and Marlowe as Rivals and Imitators 43 This has a hateful energy and resonance very different from the smoothly articulated speeches of Barabas, yet without Marlowe's Jew of Malta it is hard to see how Shakespeare could have created The Merchant of Venice. The one play overlays the other. The relations between these two great dramatic poets, almost exact contemporaries, have not yet been fully understood. Among the many critics who have written on this difficult subject - most to needlessly reiterate Shakespeare's superiority to Marlowe11 - Nicholas Brooke best grapples with the complexity of the relationship. His conclusion is that "Marlowe seems to have been for Shakespeare not only a great poet, as his tributes imply, but the inescapable imaginative creator of something initially alien which he could only assimilate with difficulty, through a process of imitative re-creation merging into critical parody." 12 We tend to forget that, even though Marlowe died in 1593, a significant part of his theatrical career overlapped Shakespeare's, and the reverse question of Shakespeare's influence on Marlowe is even more teasing than the one we have been considering. In Edward //, for example, Marlowe is moving in a distinctly Shakespearean direction, with Shakespeare's earliest history plays serving as models. It is also true that Shakespeare is increasingly able to shake off Marlowe's influence, which virtually disappears in the progress from T it us Andronicus to King Lear. How to account for these shifting dependencies and autonomies? It looks as if Shakespeare was finally able to exorcise his fascination with the demonic Marlowe, but Marlowe at the end of his career suddenly glimpses a new Shakespearean way of writing tragedy. In the absence of any rele- vant biographical data, we need to reconstruct the artistic relations of Shakespeare and Marlowe from the tentative, anxious, and perhaps even grudging influences of the plays. It seems apparent that Shakespeare, at ii. I strongly disagree with the point of view of Irving Ribner in "Marlowe and Shakespeare," SQ, XV (1964), 41-53. Ribner thinks the influence of The Jew of Malta on The Merchant of Venice has been overestimated and that the influence of Marlowe on Shakespeare is generally very small. See also the more moderate position of Wolfgang Clemen in "Shakespeare and Marlowe, " pp. 1 2 3- 1 32 , of Shakespeare 1971: Proceedings of the World Shakespeare Congress, Vancouver , August 1971 , ed. Clifford Leech and J.M.R. Marge- son (Toronto, 1972). In making the comparison between Marlowe and Shakespeare, it all depends on what criteria are invoked. Dramaturgic criteria are likely to yield more positive results than those drawn from an ideational, thematic, or strictly verbal approach. 12. Brooke, "Marlowe as Provocative Agent," ShSt XIV (1961), 44.</page><page sequence="12">44 MAURICE CHARNEY least in his earlier career, was not only actively imitating, but also trying to outdo his formidable rival playwrights and poets - Marlowe as well as Kyd, Greene, Peele, Lyly, and others. The Merchant of Venice is so radically different from The Jew of Malta because Shakespeare was so intensely aware of his powerful rival. Without directly imitating Marlowe, he is attempt- ing to surpass him in writing a tragic-comic play about an overweening Jew. Shakespeare tempers Marlowe's splendid rhetoric with a wide variety of unheroic, wheedling, and malicious touches that make Shylock less grand than Barabas but more dramatically compelling. On his side, Mar- lowe was trying to discover in Shakespeare a more theatrical, more character-oriented, and less rhetorical way of writing plays. This mutual give and take obviously influenced both playwrights to strive for dramatic effects they could not possibly have accomplished alone.</page></plain_text>
