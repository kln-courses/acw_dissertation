<plain_text><page sequence="1">NIETZSCHE'S DEBT TO LUBBOCK BY DAVID S. THATCHER "Everything human deserves ironical consideration with respect to its origin; there- fore irony is so superfluous in the world."-Nietzsche, Human, All-Too-Human, aph. 252. Like other revolutionary thinkers of his time (such as Darwin, Marx, and Freud), Nietzsche seeks a new understanding of man by revealing the hidden sources of human life, culture and civilisation. His relentless curiosity leads him time and time again to probe deeply into the origin of things. His first book bears the title The Birth of Tragedy (1872) and one of his last, Towards the Genealogy of Morals (1887). Within this span of fifteen years he pub- lished other works which contain, usually in aphoristic form, far-reaching speculations on the genesis and genealogy of religion, morality, sin, free will, justice, knowledge, logic, science, truth, language, pleasure, pain and other topics. Surprisingly, it seems to have escaped notice that the word "origin" and its cognate terms ("Ursprung," "Entstehung," "Anfang," "Herkunft," "Herkommen") occur in his vocabulary with a persisting fre- quency.' Nietzsche reserves some of his most mischievous irony for remarks on man's tendency to esteem "being" higher than "becoming," to believe that the "higher" cannot evolve from the lower and to think that "everything of the first rank must be causa sui," unconditioned, good, true and perfect.2 In the following passage one detects a reference to the opening chapter of St. John's Gospel: 1 This fascination with beginnings is also reflected in the titles of some of the books found in Nietzsche's library after his death, given here by authors in alphabet- ical order: Walter Bagehot, Der Ursprung der Nationen, trans.

THATCHER To glorify the origin-that is the metaphysical after-shoot which sprouts again at the contemplation of history, and absolutely makes us imagine that in the beginning of things lies all that is most valuable and essential. (Wanderer, aph. 3.) Such glorification must be regarded with suspicion, but there is, Nietzsche believes, something "valuable and essential" about the instruction to be gained from an investigation into origins, even though the instruction might not always be very palatable. Indeed, to use Nietzsche's decorous phrase any investigation into the "partie honteuse" of human nature is likely to be greeted with an exclamation (O pudenda origo!) of outrage and humiliation. Reaction to Darwin's theories had shown that nineteenth-century public opinion was not flattered by a line of enquiry which threatened to lower man's sense of dignity and importance. "Man's pride," Nietzsche acknowl- edges, "strives to oppose the theory of our own descent from animals and establishes a wide gulf between nature and man himself' (Dawn, aph. 31). To counter the heresy that our ancestors were not created civilized but resembled existing primitives, traditionalists of every stripe advanced a so- called "degradation" theory, according to which some races and tribes had degenerated into savagery and barbarism. Contemporary English anthropol- ogists sought to refute this theory. Entertaining a firm conviction of the "psychic unity" of mankind, these anthropologists saw in science, not in religion, the basis and guarantee of human progress and, in particular, they stressed the comparative historical method of research. The newly estab- lished discipline of anthropology, which they regarded as the most inclusive and encyclopedic of the sciences, seemed to them to be toppling theology from the throne she had occupied for centuries. Nietzsche, who had written on anthropological topics while yearning, in his adolescence, for an "ency- clopedic" approach to learning3 and had abandoned, at university, his inten- tion to study theology in favor of classics and philosophy, could be expected to be receptive to both their subject-matter and their methodology. In the work of Sir John Lubbock (1834-1913), he stumbled across an instructive and inspiriting model for his own explorations. Lubbock's chief work, The Origin of Civilisation and the Primitive Con- I have also used an equally reliable translation by R. J. Hollingdale: Twilight = The Twilight of the Idols [ 1889], (Penguin, 1968). For the remaining texts I have adhered in part to versions in the Oscar Levy (ed.), The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche (London, 1909-13), making occasional changes in the interest of style and accuracy: Human [1878] = Human, All-Too-Human; Maxims [1879] = Miscel- laneous Maxims and Opinions; Wanderer [1880] = The Wanderer and His Shadow; Dawn [1881] = The Dawn of Day.

Italics in quoted passages are Nietzsche's own. 3 While at Schulpforta Nietzsche wrote short essays on anthropological topics, including one on "Der Wilde" ("The Savage"). In an autobiographical fragment written at Schulpforta in 1864 Nietzsche wrote: "This whole period from my ninth to my fifteenth year is marked by a real passion for 'universal knowledge' as I used to call it." Werke, III, 117. [My translation.]</page><page sequence="3">NIETZSCHE'S DEBT TO LUBBOCK 295 dition of Man: Mental and Social Condition of Savages, first published in 1870, went into four editions by 1886.4 Like its predecessor, Lubbock's Prehistoric Times (1865), his Origin was translated into several languages, including German. On July 28, 1875, Nietzsche acquired the German transla- tion of the Origin (3rd edition), which had appeared that year. From then on the book seems to have accompanied him on all his European travels; he probably liked to have it by him for easy reference.5 Lubbock's work was soon appropriated by German anthropologists, such as Caspari and Lippert, so Nietzsche would also have had indirect access to his ideas. However, in keeping with Lubbock's rather tiresome coyness about the sources he used, Nietzsche refers to Lubbock only once in his published work. This partly explains why it has not yet been generally recognized how important Lub- bock's Origin was as a source-book for much of the anthropological material, both factual and theoretical, which Nietzsche incorporated into his own work, especially the two volumes of Human, All-Too-Human (1878-80) and The Dawn of Day (1881). Of the ten chapters of Lubbock's Origin Nietzsche was particularly drawn to those on religion (V-VII), on customs and morals (VIII), and on laws (X). 4 A reprint of the first edition of Origin has recently (1978) been published by the University of Chicago as part of the series "Classics in Anthropology." In his intro- duction, an up-to-date assessment of Lubbock's life and work, Peter Riviere remarks that Origin is "generally unknown and unread" nowadays, and that, though many of its ideas are regarded as mistaken and misleading, "The important thing about Lub- bock and his works is not their impact on scientific anthropology and its practitioners (past or present), but their enormous popularity with the wider reading public and the influence which, we must assume, his notions had on its anthropological ideas" (xv). One of the most distinguished of modern ethnologists, Robert H. Lowie, describes Lubbock as "one of the most versatile minds of his age, an eminent prehistorian, a writer who ranged over the whole field of anthropology and thought independently on all of its phases," but added that "his writings teem with subjective judgements, naively passed on the basis of resemblance to or deviation from European stan- dards." The History of Ethnological Theory (New York, 1937), p. 24. In addition to Lubbock's lack of detachment Lowie adds "an uncritical acceptance of tourists' tales." For Lubbock's place among English anthropologists, see J. W. Burrow, Evolution and Society (Cambridge, 1966), passim. 5 Charles Andler, Nietzsche, sa vie et sa pensee (Paris, 1928), IV, 430. Andler points out that Lubbock's book was only one in "toute une bibliotheque d'ethnographie," others being by Lecky, von Hellwald, Caspari, Lippert, Poesche, Kohler and Post, and that it would be desirable to have "une monographie tres detaillee sur les etudes ethnographes de Nietzsche" (430n.) Though some French scholars (e.g., Deleuze and Guerin) have touched on the anthropological aspects of Nietzsche's thought, a comprehensive study is long overdue. Most of the writers cited by Andler draw on the work of Lubbock as well as on his more celebrated contemporary, Edward Tylor (1832-1917). As Andler notes (Nietzsche, I, 531n.) Nietzsche had borrowed the German translation of Tylor's Primitive Culture (London, 1871) from Basel University Library on June 29, 1875, and claims that Nietzsche read it "avec soin"-a plausible contention, but not one for which Andler provides any evidence. In fact, Nietzsche seems far more indebted to Lubbock than to Tylor, the consequence, perhaps, of owning a book as opposed to borrowing one for a short period. Among Nietzsche's friends, Erwin Rohde and Paul Ree took a particular interest in anthropological writings.</page><page sequence="4">296 DAVID S. THATCHER Lubbock's Darwinian posture is evident at the outset: "The whole his- tory of man shows how the stronger and progressive increase in numbers, and drive out the weaker and lower races," and: "A people who trusted in luck would have no chance in the struggle for existence against one which believed in law" (O, 3, 4; E, 3)." Lubbock claims that a study of the customs, laws, and ideas of primitive, non-Western peoples is of the utmost impor- tance. "The habits of existing savages," he declares, "illustrate much of what is passing among ourselves, many customs which have evidently no relation to present circumstances" (0, 1; E, 1). It is not possible to under- stand thoroughly the laws of advanced nations "unless we take into consider- ation those customs of ruder communities from which they took their origin, by which they are so profoundly influenced" (0, 431; E, 372). Furthermore, "the earlier mental stages through which the human race has passed are illustrated by the condition of existing, or recent, savages," allowing us to recognise that many primitive ideas are still "rooted in our minds, as fossils are imbedded in the soil" (0, 462, 1; E, 398, 1). Nietzsche looked upon the historian as a kind of paleontologist who, in order to scrutinize the living remains of historical periods, "must travel, as old Herodotus travelled, to other nations, especially to those so-called savage or half-savage races in regions where man has doffed or not yet donned European garb."7 Aspects of the present can illuminate the past, as aspects of the past can illuminate the present. Indeed, we find Nietzsche often appealing to some kind of atavistic survival as a means of explanation: "People who are cruel nowa- days," he writes, "must be accounted for by us as the stages of earlier civilisations which have survived; here are exposed those deeper formations in the mountain of humanity which usually remain concealed" (Human, aph. 43). Lubbock's characterization of primitive man is multifaceted: what he has to say about one specific aspect has a bearing on the whole. Constituent parts-experience, concept, and practice-are closely bound up with one another. In comparing Lubbock and Nietzsche it will be convenient to deal with experience (dreaming), concept (animism) and practice (customs) in turn, allowing the essential interrelationships to emerge in the course of the discussion. Dreaming. -According to Lubbock, dreaming is an obvious but signifi- cant link between modern man and his primitive ancestors.

Human, aph. 274: "Herein consists the historic sense, that out of given instances we can quickly reconstruct ... systems of thoughts and feelings, just as we can mentally reconstruct a temple out of a few pillars and remains of walls accidentally left standing." Nietzsche knew the Latin proverb ex ungue leonem and adapted it playfully in Ecce Homo.</page><page sequence="5">NIETZSCHE'S DEBT TO LUBBOCK 297 however, dreams have "a reality and an importance which we can scarcely appreciate." Lubbock continues: During sleep the spirit seems to desert the body; and as in dreams we visit other localities and even other worlds, living, as it were, a separate and different life, the two phenomena are not unnaturally regarded as the comple- ments of one another. Hence the savage considers the events in his dreams to be as real as those of his waking hours, and hence he naturally feels that he has a spirit which can quit the body. . . . When they dream of their departed friends or relatives, savages firmly believe themselves to be visited by their spirits, and hence believe, not indeed in the immortality of the soul, but in its survival of the body.8 Nietzsche argues on similar lines, though he maintains that the imagination of civilized men is temperate, and "even in dreams there does not happen to us what former peoples saw while still awake" (Human, aph. 236). His real interest, however, lies in developing the philosophical implications of Lub- bock's descriptions: In the ages of a rude and primitive civilisation man believed that in dreams he became acquainted with a second actual world; herein lies the origin of all metaphysics. Without dreams there could have been found no reason for a division of the world. The distinction, too, between soul and body is connected with the most ancient comprehension of dreams, also the suppo- sition of an imaginary soul-body, therefore the origin of all belief in spirits, and probably also the belief in gods. "The dead continues to live, for he appears to the living in a dream": thus men reasoned of old for thousands and thousands of years.9 Nietzsche maintains that "in dreams we all resemble the savage"; we inter- pret dreams wrongly, because in sleep the brain "constantly confounds things on the ground of the most fleeting resemblances." Moreover, it was with the same "arbitrariness and confusion" that mythologies were created."' We manufacture dreams to provide "causes" for external and 8 0, 207, 208; E, 179-180. Again: "When a dead father or brother appears to a man in his sleep he does not doubt the reality of the occurrence, and hence concludes that their spirits still live" (0, 318; E, 274). Lubbock also observes that in some cases the ghosts of the great will become gods (0, 340; E, 293), and that "in the Tonga Islands the chiefs are regarded as immortal, the Tooas or common people as mortal" (0, 363; E, 312).

How does it happen, asks Nietzsche, that the mind of the dreamer is always so mistaken, while the same mind, when awake, is habitually cautious and sceptical? He proposes an arresting solution: I hold, that as man now still reasons in dreams, so men reasoned also when awake through thousands of years; the first causa which occurred to the mind to explain anything that required an explanation, was sufficient and stood for truth. (This, according to travellers' tales, savages still do to this very day.)"l Lubbock had pointed out that "the mind of the savage, like that of the child, is easily fatigued, and he will then give random answers, to spare himself the trouble of thought," and he quoted a traveller's view: The savage may be observed occasionally to become forgetful when volun- tarily communicating information. ... A short conversation wearies him, particularly if questions are asked that require efforts of thought or memory on his part. The mind of the savage then appears to rock to and fro out of mere weakness, and he tells lies and talks nonsense. (0, 9-10; E, 7-8). Nietzsche follows suit in words which are even closer to Lubbock's in the German versions: Even at the present day travellers are accustomed to remark how prone the savage is to forgetfulness, how, after a short tension of memory, his mind begins to sway here and there from sheer weariness and gives forth lies and nonsense. 12 Dreams, then, help us to experience this primitive mentality; they carry us back "into remote conditions of human culture, and provide a ready means of understanding them better." They also teach us something about our- selves, for it is on the foundation of dreams that the "higher reason" has developed: From these circumstances of false dream-interpretation we may gather how lately the more acute logical thinking, the strict discrimination of cause and 1 Human, aph. 13. I cannot find any exact parallel in Lubbock, but he stresses the "extreme mental inferiority" (O, 10; E, 7-8) of primitives, noting that though they "always have a reason, such as it is, for what they do and what they believe, their reasons often are very absurd" (0, 7; E, 6). As for explanations of natural phenom- ena, the primitive is frequently too apathetic to form any hypothesis whatsoever: "As a general rule savages do not set themselves to think out such questions, but adopt the ideas which suggest themselves most naturally" (0, 194; E, 168). See also 0, 206; E, 178. 12 Human, aph. 12. The German original reads: "Noch jetzt pflegen Reisende zu beobachten, wie sehr der Wilde zur Vergesslichkeit neigt, wie sein Geist nach kurzer Anspannung des Gedachtnisses hin und her zu taumeln beginnt und er, aus blosser Erschlaffung, Lfigen und Unsinn hervorbringt." The corresponding passage in Lubbock reads: "Man kann bemerken, wie . . . der Wilde zur Vergesslichkeit neigt. . . . Der Geist des Wilden scheint dann aus blosser Erschlaffung hin und her zu taumeln, und er bringt Liigen und Unsinn vor" (E, 8). Nietzsche's phrase "Anspannung des Gedichtnisses" is also an echo of Lubbock's "Gedachtnissanspannung."</page><page sequence="7">NIETZSCHE'S DEBT TO LUBBOCK 299 effect has been developed, when our reasoning and understanding faculties still involuntarily hark back to those primitive forms of deduction, and when we pass about half our life in this condition.'3 In fact, Nietzsche argues, primitive man constantly looked for causes and causal explanations, but without knowing anything about natural law; he did not understand the phenomena of sunshine, or rainfall or the process of seasonal change. By means of false dream interpretation he accounted for such things in terms of gods, spirits and daemons: Now man believed originally that wherever he saw something happen, a will had to be at work in the background as a cause, and a personal, willing being. Any notion of mechanics was far from his mind. But since man believed, for immense periods of time, only in persons (and not in substances, forces, things, and so forth), the faith in cause and effect became for him the basic faith that he applies wherever anything happens-and this is what he still does instinctively: it is an atavism of the most ancient origin. (Science, aph. 127.) Animism.--Nietzsche agrees with Lubbock in attributing to primitive man the belief (which Edward Tylor had dubbed "animism") that all animals and plants, even inanimate and motionless things, possess souls or spirits. "It is probably for this reason," says Lubbock, "that in most languages inanimate objects are distinguished by genders, being at first regarded as either male or female."'4 To Nietzsche this attribution was yet another fundamental mistake: When man assigned a sex to all things, he did not believe that he was merely playing; but he thought, on the contrary, that he had acquired a profound insight: -it was only at a much later period, and then only partly, that he acknowledged the enormity of his error. In the same way, man has attributed a moral relationship to everything that exists, throwing the cloak of ethical significance over the world's shoulders. " Since primitive men "supposed that the mind was everywhere," they did not regard it as a characteristic peculiar to them, and consequently were "not ashamed of being descended from animals or trees (the noble races thought themselves honoured by such legends)."'1 Urged on by "the illusion that there was nothing inanimate" (Dawn, aph. 142), primitive men "imposed 13 Human, aph. 13. Nietzsche continues: "The poet, too, and the artist assign causes for their moods and conditions which are by no means the true ones; in this they recall an older humanity and can assist us to the understanding of it." The entire aphorism is brilliantly compressed into three sections of The Twilight of the Idols beginning with "The Error of Imaginary Causes." 14 0, 275; E, 237. Lubbock makes the further interesting point that "as a general rule nations in whose languages the division of the nouns into classes has no reference to the distinctions of sex, possess no mythology." (0, 328; E, 283). 15 Dawn, aph. 3. Cf. Dawn, aphs. 47 and 100; Human, aph. 11. 16 Dawn, aph. 31. Nietzsche's point is that both attitudes towards "mind" are prejudices, one primitive and one modern. In chapter VI, Lubbock discusses animal ancestors and tree worship.</page><page sequence="8">300 DAVID S. THATCHER their own personalities" on "clouds, thunder-storms, wild beasts, trees, and plants" and other natural phenomena, projecting into them "their own evil and capricious temperaments" (Dawn, aph. 17). This was one reason why, in "barbarous" ages, "pessimistic judgments held sway over men and the world" (Dawn, aph. 42). In keeping with Lubbock's claim that among primitive men evil spirits are commonly held responsible for disease, Nietzsche writes that the sick man is regarded as "the resting-place of certain demoniacal beings who have entered into his body as the result of some offence he has committed ... the sick are the guilty!" 17 Perhaps as a reaction to some of the horrific examples of primitive healing given in Lubbock's book (e.g., 0, 27-31; E, 22-25), Nietzsche remarks: The worst disease of mankind has arisen from the struggle against diseases, and apparent remedies have in the long run brought about worse conditions than those which it was intended to remove by their use. (Dawn, aph. 52.) Lubbock notes the general conviction among primitive people "that there is no such thing as natural death, and that when a man dies without being wounded he must be the victim of magic" (0, 217; E, 187.) Similarly, Nietzsche observes that "all maladies, even death itself, are the result of magical influences" and that "illness and death never happen naturally-the whole conception of 'natural sequence' is lacking" (Human, aph. 111). Since deities and spirits, Lubbock explains, were universally regarded as evil and malevolent, primitive man lived "in continual apprehension" of their attacks. Seeking to defend himself, he had recourse to "charms, to the fantastic ceremonies of the priest, or the powerful influence of his mani- tous." What Lubbock calls the "dread of the unseen powers" is conse- quently "wasted on the production of mere ceremonies and sacrifices."1 Nietzsche's account is almost identical: By the fact that, for thousands of years, things (nature, tools, property of all kinds) were thought to be alive and to possess souls, and able to hinder and interfere with the designs of man, the feeling of impotence among men has become greater and more frequent than it need have been: for one had to secure one's things like men and beasts, by means of force, compulsion, flattery, treaties, sacrifices-and it is here that we may find the origin of the greater number of superstitious customs, i.e. of an important, perhaps para- mount, and nevertheless wasted and useless division of mankind's activity !19 17 Dawn, aph. 202. As this aphorism goes on to say, modern man is no better off: "We still lack, above all, those physicians who have learnt something from what we have hitherto called practical morals and have transformed it into the art and science of healing."

Peter Gast, who was with Nietzsche during much of the time The Dawn was being written, confirms that the book was "primarily concerned" with two psychological problems, the problems of fear and power.

He tried, writes Nietzsche, to compel these spirits to do his bidding, to force nature (perceived as the sphere of the irregular, the arbitrary, the unpredictable) to conform to human "law and order." Since every individual felt that his existence and happiness, like those of his family and community, were bound up with the mysterious and terrible powers of nature, the question of control and manipulation of those powers assumed vital importance. The aphorism continues: The aim of those who believe in magic and miracles is to impose a law on nature, -and, briefly, the religious cult is the result of this aim. The problem which those people have set themselves is closely related to this: how can the weaker race dictate laws to the stronger, rule it, and guide its actions (in relation to the weaker)?21 The most harmless sort of compulsion, continues Nietzsche, is by suppli- cation and prayer, by submission, by the payment of taxes and the offering of gifts, and by "flattering glorifications," that is, the sort of compulsion "which one exercises when one has gained anyone's affection." Lubbock reports that some tribes offer prayers, offerings and sacrifices, especially to their fetishes,22 and also mentions compulsion through treaties, compacts, and pledges; primitive man would try, before a battle, to propitiate the spiritual powers "by promising a share of the spoil after victory" (0, 322-23; E, 302). But by far the most important form of "more forcible compulsion," Nietzsche suggests, is magic and witchcraft: As with the sorcerer's help man is able to injure a more powerful enemy and keep him in fear, as the love-charm works at a distance, so the weaker man believes he can influence the mightier spirits of nature. The principal thing in all witchcraft is that we must get into our possession something that belongs to some one, hair, nails, food from their table, even their portrait, their name.23 20 Human, aph. 111. Cf. 0, 277-78; E, 239. 21 Nietzsche appears to be anticipating James Frazer's well-known definition: "By religion I understand a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct and control the course of nature and human life." Quoted by Abram Kardiner and Edward Preble, They Studied Man (New York, 1961), p. 95. 22 0, 321-22; E, 277. Cf. Lubbock: "The negro of Guinea ... hides [his Fetich] in his waist-cloth, if about to do anything of which he is ashamed, so that the Fetich may not be able to see what is going on" (0, 219; E, 189), and Nietzsche: "When it is not to see something, the negro hides the fetish in his clothing."

THATCHER In this passage, as in the following account of fetishism, which Lubbock defines as a stage of religion "in which man supposes he can force the deities to comply with his desires" (0, 199; E, 172), Nietzsche clearly demonstrates his indebtedness: If a god is bound to his image we can use the most direct compulsion against him (through refusal of sacrificial food, scourging, binding in fetters, and so on). In order to obtain by force the missing favour of their god the lower classes in China wind cords round the image of the one who has left them in the lurch, pull it down and drag it through the streets in the dust and the dirt: "You dog of a spirit," they say, "we gave you a magnificent temple to live in, we gilded you prettily, we fed you well, we offered you sacrifice, and yet you are so ungrateful."24 In short, the aphorism concludes, "the essence of the religious cult is to determine and confine nature to human advantage, to impress it with a legality, therefore, which it did not originally possess." The cult is based on sorcery ("the sorcerer is older than the priest") but also on "nobler" prem- ises: human sympathy, goodwill and gratitude, the giving and receiving of pleas and pledges, the making of treaties between enemies, and the claim to the protection of property. Yet the cult also exposes man's vulnerability. Nietzsche appears to build on Lubbock's ideas about human weakness and insecurity not to show, as Lubbock had done, that religion has become more moral, but to point out the origin of man's "strongest propensity," the will-to-power: Since the feeling of impotence and fear was so strong, and for such a length of time in a state of constant stimulation, the feeling of power in man ... has become his strongest propensity: and the means he discovered for creating it form almost the entire history of culture.25 Knowledge, at least for the common man, is a matter of reducing something strange and disturbing to something familiar and not frightening-it is "the instinct offear that bids us to know" (Science, aph. 355). Desiring to elim- inate the feeling of distress and oppression attendant on the unknown, man traces it back to the known, and, in accordance with the principle that "any explanation is better than none," experiences relief and "a feeling of power" (Twilight, p. 51; Werke, II, 975). In a remarkable anticipation of the theory Freud advanced in The Future of an Illusion (1927), Nietzsche proposed a 24 Human, aph. 111. Cf. 0, 319-20, 320-321, 343-44; E, 276, 277, 280, 296. It is difficult to understand, from Nietzsche's truncated version of this custom, why the Chinese thought this treatment would make their god better disposed towards them. Lubbock shows rather charmingly how the Chinese were able to reinstate their god (0, 324-25; E, 280). Tylor describes the same ceremony in Primitive Culture, but Nietzsche is probably following Lubbock as both refer to the "lower classes" in China carrying it out, and Tylor does not. 25 Dawn, aph. 23. Nietzsche also refers to the necessity of inducing fear by means of external appearance, "a matter which is so frequent and of so great importance in the lower and more dangerous stages of culture that it even lays down the proper gestures and ceremonials." (Dawn, aph. 515).</page><page sequence="11">NIETZSCHE'S DEBT TO LUBBOCK 303 rationale of the will-to-power based on its opposite, the powerlessness of primitive man to cope with the unpredictable power of hostile forces, real or imaginary: In the inner psychic economy of the primitive man, fear of evil predominates. What is evil? Three things: chance, the uncertain, the sudden. How does primitive man fight against evil?-He conceives it as reason, as power, even as a person. In this way he establishes the possibility of entering into a kind of treaty with it and in general to exercise influence over it in advance-to forestall it. (Will, aph. 1019). A second expedient, Nietzsche continues, is to interpret the "malice and harmfulness" of events as mere appearance, as really "well-meant" and "meaningful"; a third expedient is to interpret evil as "deserved," justifying it as "punishment." Yet all these are forms of submission to evil, indicating "faith that a good meaning lies in evil means to abandon the struggle against it": Now the whole history of culture represents a diminution of this fear of chance, the uncertain, the sudden. For culture means learning to calculate, to think causally, to forestall, to believe in necessity. With the increase of culture, man can do without that primitive form of submission to ills (called religion or morality), that "justification of evil."26 Morality, according to Nietzsche, begins in the fear of an "incomprehen- sible," "supra-personal" power, and extends into every aspect of primitive life; "education and hygienics, marriage, medicine, agriculture, war, speech and silence, the relationship between man and man, and between man and the gods..... Everything, therefore, was originally custom."27 Customs. -Lubbock has much to say on the "tyranny of custom." To counter the widespread misconception that primitive human beings enjoyed a considerable degree of personal freedom, Lubbock insists that mankind was, in fact, the slave of "law, rule and precedent": All over the world his daily life is regulated by a complicated and often most inconvenient set of customs (as forcible as laws), of quaint prohibitions and privileges.... Every action of [his life] is regulated by numerous rules, none the less stringent for being unwritten.28 Similarly, Nietzsche notes that "even where custom is difficult, hard, and 26 Ibid. Cf.: "As the sense of causality increases, so does the extent of the domain of morality decrease." (Dawn, aph. 10). 27 Dawn, aph. 9. Lubbock confirmed what Nietzsche had learnt from Jakob Burckhardt, that it was fear which created the false gods, and that sorcery was one means of compulsion against them. Civilization, in Nietzsche's view, implies that "we need no longer go about in continual fear of wild beasts, barbarians, gods, and our own dreams." (Dawn, aph. 5). Cf. Dawn, aph. 142. 28 0, 434, 436; E, 374, 376. Cf. Nietzsche: "If we consider the rude, early condi- tion of nations, or contemplate present-day savages at close quarters, we find them most strongly influenced by law and by tradition" (Human, aph. 111.)</page><page sequence="12">304 DAVID S. THATCHER burdensome, it is preserved on account of its apparent highest usefulness" (Human, aph. 97). Though it may be totally irrational, the custom is still rigidly adhered to. Nietzsche borrows an example from Lubbock to illustrate his point: In former ages, when all science was crude and primitive, and when a matter was taken for granted on the smallest evidence, then the worth or worthless- ness of a moral recipe was determined as we now determine any other precept: by reference to the results. If the natives of Alaska believe in a command which says: "Thou shalt not throw a bone into the fire or give it to a dog," this will be proved by the warning: "If thou doest thou wilt have no luck when hunting." Yet, in one sense or another, it almost invariably happens that one has "no luck when hunting."29 Nietzsche gives other examples of "strict, and on the whole, superfluous regulations," justifying them on the following grounds: These laws serve to keep people continually reminded of the custom, and the imperative necessity on their parts to conform to it; and all this in support of the great principle which stands at the beginning of all civilisation: any custom is better than none. (Dawn, aph. 16.) Nietzsche coins the punning phrase "Sittlichkeit der Sitte" (morality of mores or custom) to emphasize that morality can be reduced to a simple formula: obedience to customs.30 Customs acquired sanctity and unques- tioned authority because they were the traditional ways of acting and valuing and because of the fear of supernatural punishment consequent upon any violation (Dawn, aph. 9). The "morality of mores" constitutes "the labor performed by man upon himself during the greater part of the existence of the human race, his entire prehistoric labor"; despite "the severity, tyranny, stupidity, and idiocy" it involved, it was by this means that "man was actually made calculable" (Genealogy, p. 59; Werke, II, 800). Although traditions and observances were sometimes established on the flimsiest grounds (for example, some chance event or accident), and although their initial purpose soon became incomprehensible and their continuation absurd, men still hallowed and followed them: "How the tradition has arisen is immaterial, at all events without regard to good and evil or any immanent categorical imperative, but above all for the purpose of preserving a com- munity, a generation, an association, a people" (Human, aph. 96). Once the original purpose had been lost sight of, men continued to justify traditions in the most convoluted and intricate ways. As a result, whatever has lasted a long time is so permeated with reason that its irrational origins become improbable (Dawn, aph. 1). This "reason" is often masquerade: in every prevalent religion and morality "the reasons and purposes for habits are always lies that are added only after some people begin to attack these habits 29 Dawn, aph. 24. Cf. 0, 436-37; E, 376-77. Nietzsche's allusion to the African custom of approaching a sovereign backwards (Dawn, aph. 448), may derive from Lubbock (0, 35-36; E, 29-30). 30 I have dealt with this matter in some detail in "Nietzsche, Bagehot and the Morality of Custom," Victorian Newsletter No. 62 (Fall, 1982), 7-13.</page><page sequence="13">NIETZSCHE'S DEBT TO LUBBOCK 305 and to ask for reasons and purposes" (Science, aph. 29). But, whether the upshot is rationalization or rationale, examination of customs served as "the wide training-ground of the intellect" but not only in the development of religion: Here also is the venerable, though dreadful, primeval world of science; here grow up the poet, the thinker, the physician, the lawgiver. The dread of the unintelligible, which, in an ambiguous fashion, demanded ceremonies from us, gradually assumed the charm of the intricate, and where man could not unravel he learnt to create.3' Even a moral prohibition which appears absurd can incite us "to make an experiment in order to learn why the prohibition was made" (Wanderer, aph. 48). Given the stranglehold of tradition and custom, how was it possible for new and divergent ideas to manifest themselves? The answer of both Lub- bock and Nietzsche is-by means of insanity, real or feigned. Noting that mad people are regarded as inhabited or possessed by some deity, Lubbock describes how prophets, or "wees," attain a clairvoyant state: "These wees are nervous excitable men, such as would become mediums, and in giving oracles they go into actual convulsions." (0, 216-17, 334; E, 187; 288.) Nietzsche draws on Lubbock to explain that any challenge to custom, to be successful, must inspire dread and reverence; it must indicate an "entire lack of consciousness as clearly as the convulsions and foam of the epileptic, which appeared to typify the insane person as the mask and speaking- trumpet of some divine being."32 Even the examples (and the reference to "Medizinmann," also used in Human, aph. 243, and Dawn, aph. 42) are mostly Lubbock's: The means of becoming a medicine-man among the Indians, a saint among Christians of the Middle Ages, an angecok among Greenlanders, a Pagee among Brazilians, are the same in essence: senseless fasting, continual abstention from sexual intercourse, isolation in a wilderness, ascending a mountain or a pillar, "sitting on an aged willow that looks out upon a lake," and thinking of absolutely nothing but what may give rise to ecstasy or mental derangements.33 31 Dawn, aph. 40. Cf.: "Do you really believe that the sciences would ever have originated and grown if the way had not been prepared by magicians, alchemists, astrologers, and witches whose promises and pretensions first had to create a thirst, a hunger, a taste for hidden and forbidden powers?" (Science, aph. 300.) 32 Dawn, aph. 14. See also "The Veneration of Insantiy" (Human, aph. 127). 33 Dawn, aph. 14. In the space of a few pages Lubbock mentions the Indians, the Brazilian pagee and the Greenland angecok. The angecok, he says, "must retire from all mankind for a while into some solitary recess or hermitage, [and] must spend the time in profound meditation. ... At length, by abandoning the converse of men, by fasting and emaciating the body, and by a strenuous intenseness of thought, the man's imagination grows distracted, so that blended images of men, beasts, and monsters appear before him" (0, 245; E, 211).

THATCHER Yet Nietzsche also commends insanity and "voluntary martyrdom" as a means whereby "the evil gods" could be compelled to be well-disposed towards a community, and whereby "intellectual leaders" could "stir up the sluggish though prolific mire of their customs" and achieve a new belief, especially in themselves: The more their minds followed new paths, and were consequently tormented by pricks of conscience, the more cruelly they battled against their own flesh, their own desires, and their own health-as if they were offering the gods a compensation in pleasure, lest these gods should wax wroth at the neglect of ancient customs and the setting up of new aims. (Dawn, aph. 18). Nietzsche pays tribute to these pioneers who, by challenging the values of their time, were branded as heretical, as wicked, even as criminal: They reawakened again and again the sense of comparison, of contradiction, of the pleasure in what is new, daring, untried; they compelled men to pit opinion against opinion, model against model. Usually by force of arms, by toppling boundary markers, by violating pieties-but also by means of new religious and moralities. In every teacher and preacher of what is new we encounter the same "wickedness."34 Lubbock's observations on the lengthy period of pre-history during which irrationality and the power of custom held sway may, in part, lie behind Nietzsche's attack on Hegel, in which he refers scathingly to Hegelian "world-history" as "that ridiculously small division of mankind's existence": Nothing has been more dearly bought than the minute portion of human reason and feeling of liberty upon which we now pride ourselves. But it is this very pride which makes it almost impossible for us today to be conscious of that enormous lapse of time, preceding the period of "world-history" when "morality of custom" held the field, and to consider this lapse of time as the real and decisive epoch that established the character of mankind. (Dawn, aph. 18). The long supremacy of the "morality of custom" is now coming to an end, and stands revealed as a means to the creation of "the sovereign individual, like only to himself, liberated from morality of custom, autonomous and supramoral (for 'autonomous' and 'moral' are mutually exclusive)" (Genealogy, p. 59; Werke, II, 801). Such statements show Nietzsche devel- oping anthropological insights to buttress his own philosophical structures, and to hint at the role of the "superman" first made explicit in Also sprach Zarathustra. Conclusion.--To assess the significance of Nietzsche's direct or indirect debt to Lubbock (or, indeed, to other anthropologists of whom Lubbock might be taken as representative) is a fairly straightforward matter. Despite his rather pedestrian and unadventurous approach, Lubbock possessed a quality Nietzsche associated with some English thinkers, a quality of "indus- trious diligence" which he thought not inappropriate "for scientific discover- 34 Science, aph. 79. f. Maxims, aph. 90; Dawn, aphs. 20, 98, 164, 432.</page><page sequence="15">NIETZSCHE'S DEBT TO LUBBOCK 307 ies of the type of Darwin's" (Beyond, aph. 191). In Towards the Genealogy of Morals he attacks "English psychologists"35 for their failure to arrive at a satisfactory history of the origin of morality, accusing them of "gazing around haphazardly in the blue after the English fashion" and neglecting the gray, that is, "what is documented, what can actually be confirmed and has actually existed, in short the entire long hieroglyphic record, so hard to decipher, of the moral past of mankind" (Genealogy, p. 21; Werke, II, 769). But in The Origin of Civilisation Nietzsche found a densely-packed, well- documented, informative miscellany of facts, statistics, anecdotes,36 and theories37 which lent themselves to expropriation and elaboration. The book's comparative, anthropological perspective stimulated his philo- sophical thinking and at the same time helped to emancipate him from the historical, geographical, and intellectual constrictions in which he saw other philosophers hopelessly enmeshed: "Just because they were poorly in- formed and not even very curious about different peoples, times, and past ages," he reproaches them, "they never laid eyes on the real problems of morality: for these emerge only when we compare many moralities" (Beyond, aph. 186). On similar relativist lines Nietzsche condemns his fellow European philosophers for predicating their analysis of the human condi- tion on mankind in its present state instead of seeing it as an evolving phenomenon: Everything essential in human development happened in pre-historic times, long before those four thousand years which we know something of; man may not have changed much during this time. . . . But everything has evolved; there are no eternalfacts, as there are likewise no absolute truths. (Human, aph. 2). Moreover, Lubbock helped Nietzsche to discover the origin of "the belief in unconditional authority, in ultimate truth," prompting him to try and explain the disappearance of that belief.38 The impulse that bids human beings to seek nothing but certainties Nietzsche regards as "a religious offshoot," an expression of the so-called "metaphysical need": We have no need of these certainties about the farthermost horizons in order to live a full and efficient human life, any more than the ant needs them in order to be a good ant. Rather must we ascertain the origin of that trouble- some significance that we have attached to these things for so long. For this 35 See also Science, aph. 345. No Nietzsche commentator or editor, including Montinari, has identified these writers. Perhaps Nietzsche, meaning "British" rather than "English," is referring to several of the following: Hume, Bentham, Adam Smith, Mill, Spencer, Bagehot, Buckle and Lecky. 36 Lubbock tells an anecdote to illustrate Darwin's idea that "crossed races of men are singularly savage and degraded": "A native remarked to Livingstone-'God made white men, and God black men, but the devil made half-castes'" (0, 515; E, 438). This anecdote and the idea it illustrates reappear in Dawn, aph. 272. 37 In a section of his book headed "Origin of Moral Feeling" Lubbock cites and rejects Spencer's views on utility-this is a possible source for Nietzsche's own disagreement with utilitarianism, especially in Towards the Genealogy of Morals. 38 Human, aph. 441. The most striking instance of this, of course, is the "death of God."</page><page sequence="16">308 DAVID S. THATCHER we require the history of ethical and religious sentiments, since it is only under the influence of such sentiments that these most acute problems of knowledge have become so weighty and terrifying. (Wanderer, aph. 16). In showing how customs arise, persist, and change Lubbock confirmed Nietzsche's suspicion of the ingrained anthropomorphic tendency of human thought and human institutions. In both cases, Nietzsche came to realize, uniformity of belief and custom was more important than the specific sub- stance of what, in fact, men chose to believe and practise: "Man's greatest labor so far has been to reach agreement about very many things and to submit to a law of agreement-regardless of whether these things are true or false" (Science, aph. 76). Required in the interest of the preservation and well-being of the tribe or community as a whole, this uniformity rested nonetheless on a host of egregious errors. So often is Nietzsche mistaken for an irrationalist or antirationalist that it is salutory to remember that he believed the main task of schooling was "to teach strict thought, cautious judgment, and logical conclusions" (Human, aph. 265), and that man's greatest advance, in his view, was learning to reason correctly, an advance long impeded by man's propensity for primitive modes of theory and practice: "False conclusions are the rule in older ages; and the mythologies of all peoples, their magic and their superstition, their religious cult and their law are the inexhaustible sources of proof of this theory" (Human, aph. 271). Lubbock's wealth of illustration in this regard enabled Nietzsche to explore the ethnological origins of man's susceptibility to error and illusion, and to initiate an enquiry into such questions as "how can anything spring from its opposite," e.g., "reason out of unreason, logic out of unlogic, truth out of error" (Human, aph. 1). It also helped him formulate such paradoxical notions as "truth is that kind of error without which a certain species could not exist"39-truth being regarded as a strat- egy of interpretation whereby we impose order on an essentially chaotic world in order to gain mastery of it. Indeed, it might plausibly be maintained that the radically skeptical and subversive nature of Nietzsche's epistemo- logical views (in which, for example, teleology, causality, and the "laws of nature" are looked upon as tools of human survival and predominance) can be traced as readily to the findings of Darwinian anthropology as to the theories, which Nietzsche sought to transcend, of such philosophers as Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer. Interest in the purely theoretical problem of the "thing-in-itself' and the "phenomenon" ceases, Nietzsche avers, "directly the origins of religion, art and morals have been so described that one can perfectly explain them without having recourse to metaphysical concepts" (Human, aph. 10). Nietzsche recognized that errors of various kinds could be life-preserving and life-furthering and could serve as a cordial or anodyne ("Labsal") for "those who were worn out and despairing in the wilderness" (Dawn, aph. 59); he also realized that, up to the present time, "errors have been the power most fruitful in consolations" (Dawn, aph. 424) in part because of the "odour of sanctity" which clings to them (Wanderer, aph. 75). But he did not disregard the depressing side of the picture: :9 Will, aph. 493. For further Darwinist interpretations see Science, aphs. 110, 111, 112, 115, 121, 127.</page><page sequence="17">NIETZSCHE'S DEBT TO LUBBOCK 309 Owing to errors regarding their descent, their uniqueness, their mission, and by claims based upon these errors, men have again and again "surpassed themselves" ["selber iibertroffen"]; but through these same errors the world has been filled with unspeakable suffering, mutual persecution, suspi- cion, misunderstanding, and an even greater amount of individual misery. (Dawn, aph. 425). In a Rousseauistic image Nietzsche sees man as fettered by many chains, chains forged by "the ponderous and significant errors of moral, religious, and metaphysical ideas" (Wanderer, aph. 350). One of these chains, for Nietzsche, was Christianity, and though he accepted Lubbock's praise of science and scientific method, he could not share the conventionally Victorian celebration of Christianity as the "true religion," nor ally himself with the tenacious, though muted, belief in "prog- ress" which sporadically surfaces in Lubbock's book (e.g. 0, 376-78; E, 324-25). He would probably have taken exception to Lubbock's bouts of complacency and condescension, as evidenced in the following typical pas- sage: "While savages show us a melancholy spectacle of gross superstitions and ferocious forms of worship, the religious mind cannot but feel a peculiar satisfaction in tracing up the gradual evolution of more correct ideas and of nobler creeds" (0, 193; E, 167). In these respects Lubbock must have appeared to Nietzsche guilty of the anthropomorphism both deemed charac- teristic of primitive minds. In Nietzsche's view, people can no longer claim greatness by pointing to their divine descent, "for the ape stands at its entrance," nor is there any prospect of ascent to the divine: To whatever height mankind may have developed-and perhaps in the end it will notbe so high as when they began!-there is as little prospect of their attaining to a higher order as there is for the ant and the earwig to enter into kinship with God and eternity at the end of their career on earth.40 Ends are presupposed in beginnings. Just as Darwin, albeit inadvertently, transformed our expectations about the future by revealing the origin of biological species, so Nietzsche seeks to effect a like revolution by exposing the discomforting origins of religious and philosophical concepts and moral values. The task assumed ever-increasing urgency. As he wrote shortly before his breakdown in January, 1889: "The question concerning the origin of moral values is for me a question of the very first rank because it is crucial for the future of humanity" (Ecce, p. 291; Werke, II, 1125). Any leap forward would depend on a prolonged look backward, to origins long concealed and to errors still at large. University of Victoria, Canada. 40 Dawn, aph. 49. Cf. Wanderer, aph. 14 (for the ant image) and Human, aph. 247: "It is possible that all humanity is only a phase of development of a certain species of animal of limited duration. Man may have grown out of the ape and will return to the ape again, without anybody taking an interest in the ending of this curious comedy." As has been observed, this is reminiscent of Gobineau's jocular saying: "Nous ne descendons pas du singe, mais nous y allons."</page></plain_text>
