The discovery of seven unrobbed graves containing a wealth of works of Greek art of the period 550-500 B.C. in the very heart of Central Macedonia must of necessity be a discovery of the very first importance. The graves were found shortly before the close of hostilities in 1918 and then partly examined : they were later fully and carefully excavated. Five of the graves had been opened before the arrival of Prof. Schkorpil and two more after. The contents of all alike have been here fully published and examined by Prof. Filow and Prof. Schkorpil. No discovery has yet been made in Greek lands which equals this in the wealth of bronze work or in the very high artistic quality of the objects found. The authors are to be congratulated upon a meticulous publication of the contents of the graves, which amounts in all to no less than 156 separate objects. The questions raised by a study of the objects are as important from the historical</page><page sequence="2">268 NOTICES OF BOOKS point of view as from the artistic. The position of the graves alone, far inland on the shores of Lake Ochrida, presents a problem for which we have no parallel. The authors have discussed the problems involved with the utmost caution and with the fullest commentary. The graves are all of males, and of the 156 objects here recorded there are hardly six that can be called un-Hellenic, and nothing at all that can be identified as of specifically barbarian fabric. In the style and treatment of many of the objects, however, there is much that indicates influences other than those of the civilised mainland of Greece. The objects are in gold, silver and bronze, and there is an insignificant group of pottery fragments and figures. That this absence of pottery is perhaps due to the carelessness of the original excavators of the first five graves is a suggestion that can be at once discounted by the fact that no pottery was found in the last two. We have to deal, in fact, with a remarkable group of burials of extremely wealthy folk, who substituted metal for clay in the usual lekythoi, skyphoi and amphorae of the ordinary Greek grave. From the purely artistic point of view the volute-crater in Grave I, which is, in all essentials, in perfect condition, and which stands 68 centimetres in height, and the jug also from Grave I, with an anthropomorphic handle, can rank as two of the finest Greek bronzes in existence. The gold face-masks, breast-covers and the strange gold hand-cover (from Grave I) present, on the other hand, a problem which it is not easy to solve. The bronze work is analysed by the authors into two main groups. The first exhibits bronze vessels or ornaments of pure Greek style and of the finest quality, such as the two works already mentioned, a superb mirror-handle in the shape of a male figure, a plate, a three-footed basin, a wine-dipper and some other objects. All are comparable in decoration and in shape to what has been found on Greek sites and in Greek graves in Greek territory. For the second group the authors suggest the title 'GCriechisch-barbarisch.' A large amphora 44 centimetres in height, eight three-footed bowls and five jugs, an incense-burner and some other vessels illustrate the stylistic difference to which they call attention. A silver horse and seven helmets illustrate the same differences in another way. In general this difference is one of inferior workmanship, careless or hasty decoration and inferior forms and shapes. The distinction is at once evident. But in particular there are in some cases forms of decoration which are specifically un-Hellenic, at any rate for the sixth century : thus on a fragment of a large shield, on the rim of a patera and in some few other cases there is a pronounced use of triangles, zig-zags and rectilinear ornament which might well be of the eighth or ninth century, but which are anachronisms on Greek vessels of the sixth. The authors rightly suggest the influence of Hallstatt ornament in the north Balkan region. In the first group the authors see a division into two classes, of which one comes from Greece proper and the other compares closely with bronze vessels from Campania and South Italy. Finally, there is a small class of objects-a mere handful of pins and small ornaments of that type-which cannot be called Greek at all. They are specifically North Balkan, ' Illyrian,' late-Hallstatt, or what you will. Almost all are in silver. Spiral-headed pins (which the authors say preserve the style of the late Bronze Age in these parts) and ' Omega- headed' hair-pins of a type found from Bosnia to Salonika leave us no reasonable doubt that the warriors of these graves did not scorn the humbler articles of local fabric. Again, seven of the eight helmets, of a type with a rectangular face opening, happen to be a type unusually common on the Dalmatian coast. They are, however, found also as far afield as Russia and Egypt and do not constitute a peculiarly North Balkan type, although they are rarely found in Greece itself. The authors call them an ' export type.' The briefest study of the bronze work-of both classes-leads us to only one destination, and that is Corinth (to give to one place-name the stylistic peculiarities belonging to several in the same region). The details of the gold-work, the superb cattle-frieze of the Volute- crater and its gorgon-handles, the horse and the flying birds in gold leaf, the heraldic lions of the breast-plate, the maeander and guilloche of the mask and the charming goat from the rim of a rather fragmentary crater are all as Corinthian as could be well imagined-Corin- thian not from the particular point of view of bronze work, but from every point of view from which it is possible to study Corinthian art.</page><page sequence="3">NOTICES OF BOOKS 269 We are faced then with the all-important problem of derivation, now that we are certain of origin. Did this great accumulation of bronze vessels and gold ornament come through the medium of Greek towns of the Macedonian coast or of Greek merchants in the Adriatic ? In any case the Ionian settlements of the Thracian coast are ruled out. Their commerce was not in such wares. It is rather a question of Apollonia and Epidamnos and such towns on the one hand, or Potidaea and the Thermaic or Epithracian settlements on the other. The authors cannot with the evidence at their disposal make a decision, but they favour the Adriatic chiefly because of the predominantly Corinthian character of the finds. Curiously enough they disregard the importance of Corinthian expansion in Chalcidice, which would have been able to send commerce miore easily to Ochrida than by way of Dalmatia. They are perhaps unduly influenced by the group of vessels which indicates a connexion with South Italy, though both these and similar Campanian bronzes may equally have come direct from Corinth. The group of vessels classified as ' griechisch-barbarisch ' the authors attribute to a Greek colony, either Aegean or Adriatic and near enough to Ochrida to have forwarded the Corinthian and to have manufactured the other wares. What stands out as of primary importance is that here we are in possession of a magnificent collection of Peloponnesian bronze work of the sixth century. Corinth itself has produced little or nothing of the kind thanks to the Roman antique-sellers who, as Strabo says, cleared the numerous Corinthian tombs they found and put on the market countless Corinthian bronzes: Ca-e se opoacv~eg t-v oZooVw xCv xScOZ0ocO~ voi L oXXCv vexpoxopv6'0G)v x-ipoaocv zv 'Pcovv. Ochrida has given us what Corinth cannot. There remains the problem of who were the warriors who lay in such splendour in these tombs. The panoply of each is similar. Each has iron spears and an iron sword, helmet and pins for garments. The rest is luxury and ornament. Grave I is richer than the rest, but on the whole the warriors seem to be all of equal station and wealth. Also the seven must have been contemporaries, or by stretching the dates of the objects found to the utmost it is just possible to allow for two generations. There are several possibilities: they could have been (1) local chieftains largely Hellenised, (2) Greek settlers who somehow had gone far inland, or (3) Greek mercenaries who died fighting for Macedonian chieftains. The authors with some hesitation decide for the last, partly because it most easily explains the bulk of the objects found and because it accords with the evidence of Thucydides. But there are other considerations. Greek mercenaries could hardly have carried with them in their campaigns so enormous a weight of metal, and, if they died, it is hardly credible that those they served would have sent to Greek cities for the adornmehit of the tombs of their mercenaries. Nor did Greeks normally or in fact anywhere cover the faces and bodies of their dead with masks and trappings of gold. I am impressed with the strongly Macedonian character of certain of the ' barbaric' elements to which the authors have called attention. The linear ornament on the vessels of the ' griechisch-barbarisch ' class is the sort of ornament universally used on Macedonian ceramic of the late Bronze and early Iron Age. That Iron Age types of pottery and bronze work survived in Macedonia as late as the fourth century B.c. has been abundantly proved. The Hallstatt pins and the amber beads are features of tombs of the fifth century in Macedonia at places like Aivasil and Lembet, where precisely this ' griechisch-barbarisch ' culture is seen. Iron swords of the peculiar Aegean type found in these Ochrida graves are, as the authors point out (p. 89), found at Zeitenlik near Salonika; these swords, incidentally, present us with a special problem of great importance. Macedonian warriors in coastal Macedonia were accoutred with a similar mixture of Hellenic and 'Illyrian.' But none with a fraction of the wealth of these warriors. Finally, the silver kantharoi (Nos. 32-34) reproduce exactly the shapes of Macedonian Iron Age kantharoi both in the proportion of the vessels and in their general outlines, particularly in the very open bowl, which is unlike the bowl of the usual Hellenic kantharos of the sixth century; while the handles of the three-footed bowl (No. 89) already classed as ' griechisch- barbarisch' is identical with the 'wish-bone' handle which is the essential mark of all Macedonian pottery from the earliest Bronze Age to the latest Iron Age. This particular handle has, moreover, a 'thumb-grip' which, while widespread in Danubian lands, is, in fact, common in the Macedonian Iron Age.</page><page sequence="4">270 NOTICES OF BOOKS Neither the silver kantharoi nor the bowl are adequately dealt with in the catalogue. But most important of all, I think, are the various accoutrements of gold leaf. The habit of placing small gold plaques on the mouths of the dead seems to have been a common practice in humble Macedonian tombs from the tenth to the fourth centuries. But nowhere in the Balkans has any tomb hitherto been found where such complete enrichment of the dead with gold was practised. Our only parallel for the custom is at Mycenae. But here the gold-work is quite certainly done by a Greek hand. Every element of design used is Corinthian, not Macedonian or Illyrian. We are driven to assume that Greek artists made these masks and breastplates and appliquees in a shape that was not Hellenic, just as Greek artists worked for Scythians. I can see no valid reason for supposing that Greek mercenaries were ever so buried. From the rich burials of Thracian princes there are no parallels. The Ezerovo and Panagyurishte graves contained a half-Hellenic, half-barbaric treasure, but the barbaric objects were definitely Thraco-Scythian, and in any case there were no masks or gloves of gold. Mycenae, being the only parallel of the Ochrida masks, suggests that the Balkan main- landers of the Bronze Age followed this custom for royal burials. That Bronze Age survives into Iron Age and Iron Age to the fourth century in the North-west Balkans is certain, not from the slender evidence of these tombs but from the numerous instances from burials and settlements in the Vardar region, in Bosnia and at many sites along the Adriatic. It is a reasonable possibility that Bfonze Age customs lasted also well into historic times, in view both of the conservative nature of Macedonians and Illyrians and of the isolation in which they lived. Mycenae and Ochrida may well be two phases of one culture. That the graves are those of princes rather than mercenaries, and of princes like those of Lynkestis, who were rich enough to purchase the best that Greece had to sell, seems more likely than the suggestions of Professors Filow and Schkorpil. Greek artists manu- factured the gold trappings and the bulk of the bronze vessels. Local workmen made the silver cantharoi, the swords and the small pins and rings. The bronzes classed as 'grie- chisch-barbarisch' could have been made in any Greek colony, though for myself I see no reason why they, too (except for those with Macedonian geometric ornamentation), could not have been made in Corinth : after all, the enormous mass of Attic black-figure pottery that is so badly painted as to seem utterly barbaric was made in Athens, and the sixth century saw in many parts of Greece a kind of ' mass-production' in some of the arts. The production of cheap and 'barbaric' works of art was often due, at any rate in vase painting, to the employment of barbarians in the workshops. The same may have been the case among the Corinthian bronze-workers. The authors are to be congratulated upon a fine, scholarly and satisfying piece of work. It is to be regretted that the whole treasure cannot be seen, arranged in grave groups in the National Museum at Sofia. The principal bronze vessels alone are there publicly exhibited.
