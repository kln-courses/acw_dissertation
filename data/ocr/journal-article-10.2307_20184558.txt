Music for a stick dance performed annually in Bhaktapur, Nepal, articulates a variety of meanings through its performance in the context of the G?fj?tr? festival. The musical structure provides an enabling framework through which the eschatological and emotional meanings of the festival, various social identities and "anti-structural" themes of burlesque and satire can be expressed through dance. But this "structure" is subject to re creation in performance, and has its own meanings. It articulates the social and religious configuration of urban space, and qualities ofcyclicity, enclosure and intensification that permeate various domains ofNewar cultural experience. These qualities are shared with certain visual and architectural forms, and with Hindu-Buddhist cosmol?gica! concepts that are relevant to the context of performance. In this case, therefore, musical structure is seen to be closely enmeshed with its context and with the creation of cultural meaning.

Some of them are wearing bizarre clothes or face paint: here comes a youth clad in fake-leopard-skin trousers and a white brassiere; there goes a boy with tiger whiskers painted on his cheeks. In the narrow streets the noise of the instruments, the clash of the sticks and the shouts of the dancers are deafening, and can be heard - so it is said - from the fields outside the city, though most of Bhaktapur's farming population will be in town today to watch or take part in the spectacle. We will have to stay until late afternoon to see the last of the tall bamboo structures, and the last troupe of dancers, go by. If we are still not satisfied, we can come back tomorrow, or every day for the next week, and watch yet more stick-dance groups, but the bamboo structures will not be seen again until this day next year. The festival of Ga?j?tr? or S?paru - the "Cow FestivaT - is celebrated annually by the Newar inhabitants of Bhaktapur, on the first day of the second fortnight of the month Gula, in the monsoon season, and commemorates all those inhabitants of the city who have died in the preceding twelve months. For those interested in Newar music, the festival is significant chiefly because it is marked by a particular dance, the stick-dance called Ghet?gisi or S?paru py?kh?, which is performed only at this season, to the accompaniment of a special musical piece of the same name. This music is only one element of the complex whole that is the festival, but it offers an opportunity to consider in what ways music contributes to and shares in the multiple meanings of such an event. The Newar inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley developed a rich indigenous urban culture over a period of two millennia. The performance of Newar music and Figure 3 Gh?t?gis? Dancers (photo: Richard Widdess 1999).</page><page sequence="4">182 R. Widdess dance is intimately bound up with other cultural domains, including religion and ritual, agricultural and religious calendars, social organization and Hindu-Buddhist concepts of time and space. It therefore seems possible that the characteristic structures of Newar music might be related in some way to these other domains, that their "meanings" might be definable in terms of a relatedness between music and context.1 For example, a structural characteristic of much Newar music that distinguishes it from other types of music heard in the Kathmandu Valley, such as modern film music or Indian classical music, is what might be called its "architectonic" character.2 "Architectonic" features include the segmentation of pieces into discrete sections, often of differing tempo and/or metrical structure, and processes of repetition involving expansion and contraction of material. Can such structural features be related to the spatial, social, ritual or other aspects of the contexts in which they are performed? Or is musical structure autonomous, independent of the context of musical performance? The relatively simple musical structure of Ghet?gisi, performed in the clearly defined context of a single annual religious festival, seems a logical starting point for addressing such questions. A methodological starting-point, however, is less easy to find, for, although many ethnomusicologists have cautioned against the analysis of musical structure in isolation from its social and cultural context (e.g. List 1963; Merriam 1964, 29ff.; Blacking 1971), no agreed methodology exists for context sensitive musical analysis. Consequently ethnomusicologists find it "notoriously difficult to wed nuanced musical and cultural analyses" (Shelemay 1996); Nattiez sees "clarifying the connections between music analysis and the ethnographic data" as a "paramount" but problematic objective - "ethnomusicology's current tricky situation" (1990, 61). Valuable cross-cultural guidelines for the contextual analysis of music have been proposed by Qureshi (1987), who elaborates a complex methodology with reference to her own research on the qaw?lt genre of Sufi devotional music in North India. She directs our attention towards performance processes rather than sound structures, and to the functional constraints within which such processes operate. She observes that different variables, such as melody, rhythm, elaboration, performance style and language, constitute simultaneous channels of meaning that may articulate the same or different meanings; she argues that music in general could be understood as "an open-ended semantic code which allows both the performer and listener to choose from among, or combine, several meanings, each of which is quite specific". She notes, however, that the musical variables that can be identified with contextual meaning do not constitute the whole of the music, which also partakes of a wider theory and practice common to a larger musical culture area (in the case of qaw?lt, that of North India and Pakistan). Qureshi's methodology is intended as a method of analysing whole performance genres. In the case of Ghet?gisi, the repertoire comprises only a single musical piece, of which there is limited variation in performance. Nevertheless, the fundamental tenets of Qureshi's approach are certainly applicable. Performance is the key to</page><page sequence="5">Ethnomusicology Forum 183 understanding the music's role and meanings: the music's abstract structure can have meaning only through its re-creation in performance, and it is the performers who, in response to the environment, control the articulation of such meaning. As they follow the processional route, they exemplify Qureshi's initial hypothesis that "musical sound will vary with variation in the context of its performance". Dance and music can be analysed as separate but complementary channels of meaning. However, performance also partakes of general structural features of Newar and other South Asian music, which, we will argue, are not meaning neutral; rather, they may articulate deeper levels of cultural significance. Historical and Social Context The majority population of Bhaktapur are Newars, an ethnic group who consider themselves to be the original inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley. Like Newars elsewhere in the valley they speak Newari (a language of the Tibeto-Burman family with many loan words of Indo-Nepalese and Sanskrit origin), but the dialect of Bhaktapur is distinctly different from that of Kathmandu despite their proximity (about eight miles). This linguistic distinction reflects the fact that from c. 1200 to 1769 ad these two cities were the rival capitals of independent kingdoms, which, together with the kingdom of Patan, divided the valley between them. There are many other ways in which the Newars of Bhaktapur maintain a distinct cultural identity; thus, although all three cities celebrate G?ij?tr?, the Gh?tagisi stick-dance is performed mainly in Bhaktapur, or by groups from Bhaktapur visiting the other cities.3 The three kingdoms of the valley were ruled by the Malla dynasty of Newar kings until 1768, when Prthv? N?r?yan Sh?h of Gorkha invaded the valley and conquered both Patan and Kathmandu; Bhaktapur held out until the following year, when the last Malla king, Ranjit Malla, was sent into permanent exile. The Sh?h dynasty established Kathmandu as the centre of the Gorkhali empire, which became the modern state of Nepal, with the Nepali-speaking Parbat?ya community as the political elite and other ethnic groups, including Newars, subordinated to it. In the democratic revolution of 1990, Bhaktapur acted as a focus of dissent against the established regime, and Bhaktapur still maintains an independent political stance in relation to the centre of government, through the local communist party which was returned to power in local government elections of the 1990s. Movements for Newar cultural revival receive considerable support in Bhaktapur, and there is lingering nostalgia for the days when a Newar king occupied the palace that still stands in Darbar Square: the origins of cultural practices such as Gh?tagisi are often attributed to "Malla times". Although representatives of the former Newar ruling class and their priests still live in Bhaktapur, the majority of the population are farmers (jy?pu), who live in the town but go out to the surrounding fields during the day. The jy?pu are predominantly Hindu by religion and occupy the middle stratum of the caste system;</page><page sequence="6">184 R. Widdess there is also a minority Buddhist population, divided between high-caste priests and goldsmiths, and low-caste oil-pressers. Social and cultural activities are largely organized on the basis of a combination of caste and locality: each neighbourhood (tvah) has a strong sense of corporate identity, often reinforced by caste and/or religious solidarity. G?ij?tr? processions are held by all Hindu castes; Buddhists do not celebrate this festival. Many dance and music traditions are maintained by the jy?pu and lower castes. The jy?pu are not performers by profession, but nevertheless most performance genres are open only to those who have undergone an intensive training and religious initiation rituals (Wegner 1986b). Gh?tagisi is unusual, however, in that one can participate in the dance without training or initiation; its music also demands comparatively little training compared with other genres, and no special initiation, though the musicians will often already have undergone initiation in connection with other genres. The accessibility of Gh?tagisi to all male residents, and increasingly to females and foreigners as well, undoubtedly contributes to its immense popularity today, especially among children and young adults. G?ij?tr?: Themes and Meanings Stick-dances in South Asia and elsewhere are commonly endowed with agricultural associations.4 While further research into its origins is needed, it seems likely that G?ij?tr? represents the combination of an agricultural festival with a post-funerary ritual, which contributes a further set of meanings to do with the well-being of the departed soul and of the bereaved. G?ij?tr? is the first major festival after the rains of July and August, during which intensive rice-planting work in the fields is essential for Bhaktapur's farming families. No music or dance is performed for the two months that the rains are at their height, so G?ij?tr? offers a welcome opportunity to celebrate the conclusion of this crucial agricultural operation and the arrival of somewhat drier weather and greater leisure. Hence music, dance and pantomime are not limited to the day of G?ij?tr? itself but continue for at least a week afterwards, although the days after G?ij?tr? have no special ritual significance. The Gh?tagisi music and dance performed on all these days is the same, but the different context leads to an emphasis on different meanings. The dominant theme of the G?ij?tr? day itself is the commemoration of those who have died in the city during the previous twelve months. It is believed that, after death and cremation, the soul of the departed remains in a liminal state, unable to complete its spiritual journey, until the next G?ij?tr?. On this one day of the year, the gates of Yama's realm of the dead stand unlocked, and can be pushed open by the horns of a sacred cow; the soul of the departed can enter by holding a cow's tail (Anderson 1971, 99; Toffin 1984, 522-4; Levy 1990, 442). Alternatively, it is said that the soul is conducted by a cow across the river Vaitarni that separates the world of the dead from that of the living (Levy 1990, 442; interviews 2004).5 Beyond this river await Yama's</page><page sequence="7">Ethnomusicology Forum 185 judgement hall or, in a more generally preferred belief, heavenly realms presided over by Siva or Visnu. In former times it was the custom at G?ij?tr? to drive a real cow through the streets, and finally leave her to roam free, to ensure her availability to the departed soul; this, I was told, has now been prohibited by the local authorities. Most bereaved families today resort to a symbolic cow, most commonly in the form of a tall pyramidal bamboo structure topped with cow's horns and a painted cow's face. The structure, called taha maca ("tall child") or t?h?s? ("tall cow"), represents not only the cow, but also the deceased person. This anthropomorphic symbolism is emphasized in some villages outside Bhaktapur, where the t?h?s? have arm-like cross-bars.6 These are not used in Bhaktapur itself, but nevertheless the t?h?s? is dressed in traditional cloth (different cloth for men and women) and a portrait photograph of the deceased is hung on it. The height of the t?h?s? asserts the importance of the dead person and enables his or her portrait to be clearly seen, but by convention the height must be not more than eight hath, around 11-12 feet (one hath equals the distance from fingertip to elbow). Only one t?h?s? exceeds this height by another foot or two. This is a special t?h?s? representing the god Bhairav, one of the principal guardian deities of the city, a manifestation of the great god Siva. Since this magnificent t?h?s? does not represent a dead person, but a god, it is clad in straw thatch (a local agricultural by-product used for practical and decorative purposes) rather than clothes. It is made in the neighbourhood of L?kul?che, which is particularly connected with Bhairav; and it is accompanied by t?h?s?s for the dead of that neighbourhood. Bhairav's t?h?s? provides a visible presence of the god Siva,7 whose realm the departed aspire to reach, and a summative, communal expression of the themes of the festival, since it is said that those who do not have the means to celebrate G?ij?tr? with a t?h?s? of their own need only look at the Bhairav t?h?s? to gain the same benefit for their relative's soul. Once Bhairav and his companions appear, towards the end of the afternoon, no more t?h?s?s may join the procession. They make a special parade around the Darbar Square, in front of the former royal palace, watched by hundreds of spectators, before disappearing into the twilight, and bringing G?ij?tr? to a close for another year. They are accompanied by the same music and dance as other t?h?s?s. At the end of the day, each t?h?s? is disassembled and most of its components may be recycled for other purposes. The portrait photograph will most likely hang on the wall of the family home. But the straw cow's horns and the paper mask are thrown into the river Hanumante, which flows past the city; this river, according to a widespread South Asian concept, partakes of the life-giving qualities of the sacred river Ganges, into which its water eventually flows. The cow symbols thus follow the ashes of the deceased person, which were committed to the same auspicious waters immediately following death and cremation, according to Hindu practice. The significance of this festival is partly apotropaic: without it, the departed souls would be unable to proceed along their spiritual path and might linger in the city as troublesome ghosts. It also helps to reconcile the bereaved to their loss, by assuring</page><page sequence="8">186 R. Widdess them that the community shares their grief, and by distracting them with a colourful spectacle. The functions of the music and dance thus include creating a carnival atmosphere at what might otherwise be an occasion for sadness. This aspect of the festival is emphasized in a story that is often told to explain its origin. It is said that a queen of one of the Malla kings was inconsolable at the death of her son. The king asked the citizens of Bhaktapur to help him console her by parading t?h?s?s for all their dead, to demonstrate that she was not alone in her grief, and by staging comic acts to induce her to smile again.8 The Gh?tagisi stick-dance is a major factor in creating this sense of community and carnival atmosphere (or has become so in recent decades).9 It is not essential, and some t?h?s?s are accompanied only by silently walking relatives, but a large group of musicians and dancers not only fulfils the symbolic and cathartic roles discussed above, but also lends prestige to the deceased person and their family. Many families will therefore, if possible, invite a band of musicians, preferably from the neighbourhood, and a troupe of dancers from the ranks of family and friends. The dancers head the procession, followed by the musicians, who are in turn followed by the t?h?s?, carried by stalwart bearers. Informants also offered eschatological interpretations of the stick-dance. One explained the dance as a means of clearing a path for the soul, of driving away any obstacles such as guardians at the gates of heaven. According to another, the stick dancers, musicians and other participants in the procession represent Siva's retinue, the gana ("multitude"). This retinue - the "mischievous retainers of Siva's court" (Slusser 1982, 1:234) - include celestial musicians (gandharva, kinnara) and various kinds of demons, ghosts and spirits (bh?ta, pr?ta); according to this interpretation, they are sent by Siva to welcome the departed souls as they cross the river Vaitarn?. In South Asian art the gana are frequently represented as grotesque, jovial musicians and dancers, and their leader, the elephant-headed Ganes, has become one of the best-loved deities of the Hindu pantheon. A carved stone stele of the Licchavi period (c. 300-879 ad) shows that the dancing gana has been known in Newar tradition for centuries (Figure 4): here Siva and his consort Um? are attended by a gana of five musicians and dancers, including two animal-headed percussionists (barrel-drum and cymbals), Ganes in the centre, a many-headed god and a skeletal ghost (Hutt 1994, 165). Only the sticks are needed to make this a prototypical Gh?tagisi ensemble.10 The burlesque element in G?ij?tr?, though present on the day itself, comes to the fore especially in the following days, when it is exploited for the expression, critique or creation of social, political and cultural identities. Gender is an especially contested area. Performers in the stick-dance are traditionally male, but males may impersonate females. Instead of wielding sticks, each pair of dancers may represent a husband and his "wife", both dressed in traditional costume; the "husband" pretends to drink from a wine goblet which is repeatedly replenished by his "wife". Here the dance affirms the traditional gender roles that ironically prevent real wives from taking their own part in this or any other dance. Since 1997,11 however, girls and young women have begun</page><page sequence="9">Ethnomusicology Forum 187 Figure 4 Um?-Mahesvara, Licchavi Period (detail) (photo: David Gellner; reproduced by permission from Hutt 1994, 165). to participate alongside their male friends, first as dancers, and more recently as musicians: in 2004 the first all-girl band of dh? drummers accompanied a stick-dance procession. Also in 2004, but in more cosmopolitan Kathmandu, a gay G?ij?tr? procession was reported, in which cross-dressed male dancers carried placards urging a more liberal attitude to homosexuality.12 Thus the topsy-turvy world of G?ij?tr? provides a platform for social change as well as for the reinforcement of social norms. Gh?tagisi is also a vehicle for political messages, both positive and negative. Dance groups organized by the local communist party use hammers and sickles in place of sticks. In pre-democracy times, the expression of political dissent was allowed only at G?ij?tr?, and was exploited by the Kathmandu press in spoof articles (Anderson 1971, 103). This continued in new forms in the 1990s under democratic government. In 1999, a stick-dance procession accompanied two large straw figures, labelled "Government" and "Opposition"; while their seated posture presumably denotes political inertia, their cows' horns identify them as ritual and, therefore, presumably protected symbols (Figure 5). Following seizure of power by the King in 2005 in response to the Maoist insurgency, G?ij?tr? continued to be an opportunity for protest despite the suppression of free speech: the latter, for example, was satirically represented as a person bound and gagged, and other tableaux with anti-government messages were to be seen (G.-M. Wegner pers. comm.; S. Bailey pers. comm.). After the day of G?ij?tr? itself, young people of both sexes continue to hold stick dance processions for a further week, for no other overt purpose than to enjoy themselves and assert particular identities. Youth clubs and body-building clubs</page><page sequence="10">188 R. Widdess Figure 5 Political Satire: a post-G?ij?tr? procession (photo: Richard Widdess 1999). (male and female) organize their own processions; young musicians playing traditional instruments wear T-shirts emblazoned with images of electric guitars or David Beckham, and in 2004 I observed a procession asserting its devotion to the memory of Kurt Cobain. The representation of Western culture, dress and perceived sexual mores is often ironic. In 1999, Father Christmas was to be seen dancing in the streets, alongside a figure in a stars-and-stripes hat. In 20041 observed a very tall male youth, dressed as a female tourist with long hair and short skirt, dancing with a very short man-about-town in tweed jacket and dark glasses, who was attempting to seduce her with a large banknote. Many other types of burlesque performance in the G?ij?tr? procession have been reported (Levy 1990, 446-50; Anderson 1971, 99-104). They lead Levy to describe G?ij?tr? as an "anti-structural festival", but he stresses that "this escape from structure in Bhaktapur remains for the most part carefully within the bounds of the deeper categories of social order" (1990, 595). Similarly Victor Turner writes, with reference to tribal and agrarian societies, of liminal or liminoid states in which the participants enjoy a partial freedom from the norms of society: states in which "the social order is turned upside down" through "subversive and ludic events" (he cites as examples</page><page sequence="11">Ethnomusicology Forum 189 novices posing as ghosts, gods or ancestors, animals or birds, most of which are roles that can be taken in Gh?tagisi), and yet this happens in the context of "relatively stable, cyclical, and repetitive systems" (1982, 27-9). The music of Gh?tagisi is the framework that allows burlesque to be performed, and it could well be described, as we shall see, as a "relatively stable, cyclical, and repetitive system". Some aspects of G?ij?tr? and its performances invite comparison with other mortuary rituals in South Asia and further afield, whereby further clues to meaning may perhaps be found. There are parallels to be seen in the secondary funerals of the Kotas and Gadabas of South India (Mandelbaum 1954; Pfeffer 1994; Wolf 2005, 207ff.) and in those of the Malayo-Polynesian culture area (Metcalf and Huntington 1991); there are similar notions of the soul entering a liminal period at death, and not reaching its final destination until the secondary funeral (Metcalf and Huntington 1991, 86-90). As in Bhaktapur, funerary and post-funerary rituals not only help the soul on its path, but also balance the influence of death by asserting the vitality of the living, for example through drumming, singing and dancing, revelry, display of male prowess and sexual licence (Metcalf and Huntington 1991, 114ff; Pfeffer 1994; Bakan 1999, 70ff.). In this context, cows or buffaloes are often invested with special significance as embodiments of life force, leading in some non-Hindu cultures to their sacrifice (Metcalf and Huntington 1991, 125ff; Pfeffer 1994; Wolf 2005, 203ff), but the role of the cow at G?ij?tr? is defined differently, as the saviour of the departed soul. Tall umbrellas or towers, their height reflecting the age or status of the deceased, are carried in procession at secondary funerals both among the Kota (Wolf 2005, 208) and in Bali (Metcalf and Huntington 1991, 142); these partially resemble t?h?s?s but are not interpreted as "cows". Rather, they represent the deceased, whose remains they may contain. Parallels extend to the role of music. Metcalf and Huntington, following Needham (1967), note the almost universal importance of drumming and other loud percussion in funerary and other rituals of transition, and they suggest a number of possible reasons for this (1991, 64ff.); for example, percussive sound articulates temporal divisions "the way a line or a wall demarcates space", and hence it appropriately marks the ultimate temporal division of death; the rhythm of percussion resembles the "heartbeat and rhythm of life", and hence connotes vitality; loud noise symbolizes power, especially divine power, and hence may be enlisted in communication with the divine. While all these factors may contribute at some level to the "meanings" of Gh?tagisi performance, further exploration of such cross-cultural parallels and analogies would exceed the scope of this article.13 They also relate only to the most general features of the music, rather than its specific structure. To this we may now turn, with a survey of the instruments used, the structure of the music and their role in relation to the immediate context of dance performance.</page><page sequence="12">190 R.

Structure and Meaning: 1 Figure 6 represents the material and structure of the music for Gh?tagisi as played on the principal drum employed, the small barrel-drum dh?. Local informants told me that the reason this drum is used for G?ij?tr? is that the relatively small heads are less susceptible to the dampness of the air in the monsoon season, and hence preserve their sound better than the larger dhimay drums that feature at dry-season festivals.14 The sound and style of the music, therefore, already have seasonal implications. Other drums can also be used, however, especially the barrel drum l?l?khf, which is larger than the dh? and has a black tuning-spot on each head; often two or three l?l?khiplayers alternate with the dh? players, playing idiomatic variants of the music (see below).</page><page sequence="13">Ethnomusicology Forum 191 The drums are accompanied by two sizes of cymbal: the smallest size, tah, are thick-walled and make a high-pitched, penetrating ring; the larger cymbals, bhuchy?h, are thin-walled with a hemi-spherical boss and make a lower-pitched splash. The tah makes the most penetrating sound in the ensemble and therefore serves to co-ordinate the other instruments and the dancers. The bhuchy?h can play the same rhythms as the tah y but in addition it can accentuate the beats on which the dancers clash sticks, thereby helping them to negotiate periodic changes in metre. Whereas the bhuchy?h are typically used to accompany ritual processions, the tah is normally played to accompany the d?ph? genre of devotional singing, along with the l?l?kht. Together, therefore, the two latter instruments are said to inject a devotional flavour into the dance performance.15 The dh? has two heads of slightly differing pitch. Hindu musicians play the higher pitched head with the left hand, the lower with the right.16 The lower-pitched head is struck with a short, straight wooden stick, the higher with the flat of the fingers. The mnemonic oral syllabic notation encodes techniques and sonorities as follows:17 High head undamped accented: ta unaccented: ti, ni Low head undamped accented: ghe, ghe, ghen, [jhe] unaccented: ka damped: kha Both heads simultaneous: [jhe] rolls drkha, [garajaka] [] =in dyahlh?ygu only Figure 6 shows some structural features of the Gh?tagisi music as played on dh?. 1. Sectional Structure The music comprises two sections in contrasting metres. The first section, labelled "Section A", is in a binary metre of eight beats. The second section, "Section B",18 is in a ternary metre, which we will interpret as six beats in view of its relationship with A (one could alternatively regard it as three beats). Despite the change of metre, the B section is based on the material of section A: it is a transformation of line A2 into ternary metre. The change in metre is reflected in the patterns of the cymbals. 2. Motivic Structure The drum part is based on two distinctive patterns: a. the sequence gh? t? ghe nf t?, corresponding to a sequence of low-high-low high-high sonorities. This sequence itself comprises two motives, "low-high" {gh? t?) and "low-high-high" {ghe ni t?), of which the second is a simple expansion of the first; at the semiquaver level of pulsation, the first motive can be substituted for the second to make it easier to play (see ghe (ni) t? in lines A2, A3 and B).19 Most of the piece consists of different rhythmic configurations</page><page sequence="14">192 R.

The only passage not based on (a) or its constituent motives is the first half of the first20 line, t? t? kha ti t? khagh?. This sequence does not occur elsewhere in the piece, and therefore represents a distinct thematic element. We will later consider the relationship of the A and B sections, and the variations in A, to each other. For the moment, let us consider how far we can confirm and interpret our initial analysis by reference to the immediate context. 1. Sectional Structure The two sections of the Gh?tagisi music correspond to two contrasting dance steps. In section A, the dancers, proceeding in two parallel lines, step slowly in the direction of travel, turning to clash sticks with the dancer opposite on beat 7. The rhythm of the steps is the same as the rhythm of the bhuchy?h cymbals shown in the first system of Figure 6. In section B, the tempo effectively increases and the sticks clash on every third beat (Figure 6). The dancers turn to face their opposite number, and dance on the spot with vigorous movements, one step per beat; the movements are essentially improvised, and may include pirouettes and leaps, provided the sticks do not fail to clash every three beats. In section A, therefore, the procession makes slow forward progress along its route; the music provides a walking rhythm, and the dancers conserve their energy. In section B, by contrast, the dancers show off their skill, inventiveness and strength (despite the physical strain of a three- to four-hour performance). We will shortly consider when, where and why the changes between sections A and B occur in performance. 2. Motivic Structure The importance of the drum motives ghet? and ghe mt? is explicitly recognized. The name of the dance, gh?tagisi, is derived from the first motive, although the -gisi element is obscure. This is the dance that goes "gh? t?", and in performance of section A, dancers often call out "ghet? gi si H?" as they clash their sticks (Figure 7). The sequence of low-high-high sounds in ghe mt?, and emphasis of its final t?, gives a "lift" to the dancers, who make a slight leap as they clash their sticks above shoulder level (Figure 3). The motive t? t? kha ti t? kh? gh? iconically references a song associated with G?ij?tr?, transcribed in Figure 8. The rhythm of this song and that of line Al of the Gh?tagisi music match, though it is impossible to say which might have been created first. The song is not normally sung during Gh?tagisi performance, but it is well known to Bhaktapurians, and can be sung or played on a melody instrument to the accompaniment of the drum music. The words of the song encapsulate the eschatological and emotional themes of G?ij?tr?:</page><page sequence="15">dancers Ethnomusicology Forum 193 sticks clash X j?*.

The verse seems to allude to the desire of the bereaved to cling to the soul of the departed loved one, whereas it must be allowed to depart for the river of transmigration in order eventually to gain release from the eternal cycle of life and death. As we have seen, the cow's horns from the t?h?s? are indeed consigned to the river at the end of the day. The license of burlesque also permits obscene variants of the words to be performed. It appears, therefore, that our initial analysis of Figure 6 can be confirmed and interpreted in the light of the immediate context, that of dance performance, and the wider context, that of the themes of the festival in which the dance occurs. By reference to these contexts we can assign meaning to a variety of structural features: 1. the eight-beat section A =the procession walking along 2. the six-beat section B =the dancers showing their skill and stamina 3. the motive (ghet?) ghe ni t? = the physical and emotional "lift" as the singers clash their sticks 4. the motive t? t? kha ti t? kh? gh?=the G?ij?tr? song, evoking the underlying themes of the festival. ?

Widdess It may be observed that, of these four "meanings", the mode of signification is iconic in 4, and indexical in 1, 2 and 3. These meanings do not depend, therefore, on conventional or arbitrary symbols requiring verbal explanation. Before pursuing meaning further, however, it is necessary to take into account some additional aspects of performance. Performance as Reconstruction A criticism that may be levelled against a static representation of music such as Figure 6 is that it ignores processes of performance. Qureshi has shown how the performance of qaw?lt evolves from moment to moment in response to audience reaction and other factors. Can we see Gh?tagisi, not as a concrete artefact abstracted from time, but as real-time performance? How is it put together during performance in ways that may or may not be different for another group or another year? Variation Figure 6 represents the Gh?tagisi dh? music as taught to the author and a group of students by Ganesh Bahadur and Harigovinda Ranjitkar, both of Y?che tvah, in 1997 (and subsequently confirmed by Harigovinda Ranjitkar in 1999). Most music in Bhaktapur varies as between neighbourhoods, but the variants on Gh?tagisi that occur appear to be comparatively trivial: the music is always recognizably close to what is represented in Figure 6. More radical variants are played on the other drum that is regularly used for Gh?tagisi, the barrel-drum l?l?kht. This drum is regarded as having the most complex style of playing of all the drums of Bhaktapur. Though it is not essential, it is often used in alternation with dh? in a Gh?tagisi procession; the l?l?kht interrupt the dh? from time to time, and play for a short period, while the dh? players take a welcome break before taking over in their turn. This alternation means that the l?l?kht players do not have to play exactly the same as the dh? players, although their music still has to be recognizable to the dancers and must fit the metrical structure articulated by the cymbals. The l?l?kht music for Gh?tagisi, as taught by Harigovinda Ranjitkar (Figure 9), begins with adaptations of section A, lines 1-3, of the dh? music, but there then follow two further variations which are not played by dh? (lines 4 and 5), and the syllables for section B are different from those in the dh? version. Moreover, whereas the lines in the dh? version of section A are always played in the order shown in Figure 6, Harigovinda Ranjitkar insisted that the five lines of the l?l?kht Section A can be played in any order, and may be included or omitted at will. However, in performance at G?ij?tr? 2004, Harigovinda consistently ordered lines A1-A3 in the same sequence as in the dh? version; line 4 was interspersed between the other lines at will, but line 5 was used only when returning from the B section. Thus a common template underlies both dh? and l?l?kht music. This may be so because the music for Gh?tagisi is normally played by a group of musicians (so free</page><page sequence="17">Ethnomusicology Forum 195 sticks clashx ?aUji lalakh? _^__, r^?r-^u-R?H r~3 j ^u n in ta ta kha ti ta k? gh? dr -kha gh? ta ti ni n?

Musicians and dancers ideally come from the same neighbourhood, but this is not always possible: if all local groups have already been booked, a group from another neighbourhood will have to be found. Some informal interchange of musicians between groups is also likely to occur. Rehearsal with the dancers may be limited to a brief warm-up before the start of the procession. The context, therefore, demands a relatively fixed body of musical material, known to everyone in essentially similar form.</page><page sequence="18">196 R. Widdess Sequence While the musical material of Gh?tagisi appears relatively uniform, there are other respects in which every performance will be different. The exact sequencing of dh? and l?l?kht lines is unpredictable, as each group spontaneously interrupts the other. The sequencing of the two sections, A and B, is also dependent on the performance situation, but in a more predictable way. Changes from one section to the other are initiated by the leading dh? or l?l?kht player, whichever group is playing at the time. According to Harigovinda Ranjitkar (interview 1999), there are three circumstances where the lead drummer would be likely to change from the A to the B section of the music: 1. When the music and dance have been building up to a climax for some time, getting gradually faster and louder. 2. WTien the procession reaches a place where there are many people watching. This would normally be a large square or a street-crossing, but it could also be a narrow street, "if there are lots of girls hanging out of the upper windows". Here the element of entertainment and the display of male strength and skill come to the fore, and the course of the performance reflects the physical and social geography of the town.21 3. When approaching an important shrine where the dance must stop to allow the musicians to play an invocation, dyahlh?ygu. Here the sacred geography of the town is the determining factor. In Gh?tagisi performance the musical item called dyahlh?ygu ("calling the god": Figure 10) is played only on dh?.22 It can be introduced anywhere in the musical structure, but typically at the end of the B section, providing a conclusion to the climax of the dance and a moment's rest for the dancers. Where the dancers are approaching an important shrine, therefore, the lead drummer will often change to the B section a few yards ahead of the shrine, so that the dancers can dance in honour of the god. After playing this section for a short time - or for longer if there are many people watching - he brings it to an end by playing the dyahlh?ygu, during which the dancers rest for a moment. At the conclusion of the dyahlh?ygu the musicians touch their foreheads in a gesture of respect to the deity, and then strike up with the A section of the dance again. The choice of places to play dyahlh?ygu may be fixed by tradition: Harigovinda Ranjitkar lists 16 locations along the processional route (interview 2004), though whether all players observe the same locations, or the same number, has not been verified. Such locations include major temples, such as that of Taleju (the tutelary goddess of the kings of Bhaktapur), and small wayside shrines of N?sahdyah (N?tyadeva), the patron deity of music and dance (Ellingson 1990; Wegner 1992). In her methodology for contextual music analysis, Qureshi (1987) advocates turning the abstract structures of music into a blueprint or "road map" showing the sequential ordering of units and appropriate alternatives; a road map that is "potentially capable</page><page sequence="19">Ethnomusicology Forum 197 spoken: r\ ^ha played: accel. accel r?3-1 JL? &gt;J r [jt^ 1?3?1 ?C??/. ?

The dynamic or motivation behind such a generative programme comes, she suggests, from the context of performance. We have now seen how the abstract, static representation of structure in Figure 6 is reconstructed in performance, and how certain aspects of that reconstruction - the changes from A to B to dyahlh?ygu - are motivated by the immediate context of performance - the social and religious configuration of the processional route. Armed with this information (though it was not yet formulated as a diagram), I played dh? in a Gh?tagisi procession in 1999 and found myself able to predict with reasonable accuracy the timing of changes from sections A to B to dyahlh?ygu. We can therefore construct a road map or generative programme along the lines of Figure ll.23 Structure and Meaning: 2 The performance of Gh?tagisi, like most performance, is thus a process of re-creation. Such re-creation involves not only music but all aspects of the event - including the dance, the construction and decoration of the t?h?s?, the social messages conveyed by the size and elaborateness of the procession, the religious concepts with which the participants interpret the event to themselves and others, the feast with which the bereaved family reward all who took part in the procession and so on. Re-creation, however, does not always result in change or difference, as contextual factors may limit the scope for variation. For example, the t?h?s?s are all different in detail, but they are uniform in height, according to a traditionally accepted maximum. The route taken by the processions is laid down by convention. Similarly it seems that the musical template represented by Figure 6 is respected in performance, even in the more elaborate and variable performances of l?l?kht players.</page><page sequence="20">198 R.

Does "meaning" reside only in those aspects of performance that change in response to context? Qureshi (1987) suggests that certain aspects of music may be derived from a wider regional music culture and therefore do not participate in the construction of meaning. But Susan McClary (2000) argues that the conventions and frameworks of a musical idiom are powerfully meaningful, not only the deviations from norm that occur in specific pieces or performances. For example, of the conventional 12-bar blues structure, which she argues "operates on the basis of a call/ response mechanism" (2000, 39), she writes: While our attention focuses on the imaginative nuances displayed by each new instantiation of the blues, the facilitating pattern itself counts as the most important signifier in the lot: it acknowledges a social history, a lineage descending from a host of tributaries. And with each verse, each performance, it reinscribes a particular model of social interaction. (McClary 2000, 41)24 We have seen that the Gh?tagisi music provides an enabling framework for the expression of various meanings - including "anti-structural" ones - through dance and burlesque. What then are the meanings of the framework itself? Our analysis of the dh? music reveals two interrelated features that are widely shared with other Newar music and with other South Asian musics:</page><page sequence="21">Ethnomusicology Forum 199 1. The cyclic rotation of the music; and 2. The contraction and expansion of metrical space and motivic material. Cyclicity may be defined as a special type of temporal structure that returns to the beginning, either once or repeatedly; we could call it circularity, but we will reserve that term for spatial configurations. We have already seen that the music of Gh?tagisi is repeated from the beginning, in whole and in parts: each line of section A is played twice, each section is repeated until it is time to move into the other, and the whole piece is repeated as many times as necessary to complete the circuit of the processional route. Performance is punctuated at intervals by the dyahlh?ygu, and this is played both at the beginning and at the end, closing the largest musical cycle, the complete performance. Contraction and expansion of metrical space and musical material operate in different ways in the A and B sections (Figure 12). In A, Al begins with the "theme" of the G?ij?tr? song (a) in the first half, followed by the ghet? ghentt? cadence {z), which introduces the two characteristic motives of the piece {ghet? and ghentt?). A2 begins with new material in the first half {y, based on the ghentt? motive at double speed), but in the second half returns to the ghet? ghenf t? cadence of Al {z). A3 begins with another new rhythmic idea {x, based on the ghet? motive at two speeds), then a fragment of {y) from A2 but displaced into the second half of the cycle, and finally a fragment of the cadence (z). The music of the last two beats ("fa (t?)")25 remains constant throughout section A: beat 7 is the "lift" at which the dancers clash their sticks while walking along. Thus new material is introduced at the beginning of lines A2 and A3, and material that was there before is progressively truncated or compressed into the second half of the line. In performance, the process of increasing density (both density of beat subdivision and density of musical material within the eight-beat cycle) reverts to the beginning when the whole section is cyclically repeated. The B section, as we have seen, is a reformulation of A material in ternary metre: the cycle length is reduced from eight to six beats, but the drum pattern is closely based on A2, modified so as to emphasize with the stroke t? the two points at which the sticks now clash - beats 3 and 6 - but retaining the z cadence {ghet? ghentt?). This then is a different method of increasing density: instead of compressing more material into a fixed durational span, the same material is now compressed into a shorter durational span. The close relationship of sections A and B to each other is tellingly demonstrated by the manner in which transitions from one to the other can be made in performance. Changes in either direction can be made abruptly, without transition, at any point; but a smooth transition is, in Harigovinda Ranjitkar's view, preferable. B is typically introduced in performance as an interpolation between A2 and A3. On the repeat of A2, the eight beats are reduced to seven, by omitting the last beat; this leads into B, where the number of beats is further reduced to six. There is thus a gradual contraction in the length of A2 to the point where it becomes B (Figure 13).</page><page sequence="22">200 R.

The reverse transition, from B to A, is even more subtle and effective. When dancing, I repeatedly sensed that in some mysterious way, the B section had "become" section A again without my being aware of the transition. Learning the dh? music revealed that the drummers return directly from B to A3 - logically enough, since it was at the end of A2 that the B section was interpolated. But this sequence does not sound like an abrupt change. This is because the structure of A3 can be related to B not only, as one might expect, by expansion, but also by contraction</page><page sequence="23">a h ? ^ ^ ^ ^j j i ^ u- r r a Ethnomusicology Forum 201 X D ghe (ni) ta ghe (ni) ta ghe ta ghe (ni) ta gh? dr-kha gh? ta ghe ni ta (ta) m ii l ^ ^? ^ ^ Jl cJ cJ [j: ghe (ni) ta ghe (ni) ta ghe ta ghe ni ta gh? dr-kha gh? ta ghe ni ta dr-kha ?i^^S'U d- ^ u- , ghe (ni) ta ghe (ni) ta gh? ta dr-kha gh? ta ghe ni ta dr-kha Figure 13 Transition from A to B. (Figure 14). The initial motive of A3, gh?tagh?ta can be understood as a diminution (a reduction of the durations) of the B cadence ghet? ghentt?, and as a contraction of this motive from three to two beats. Confirmation of this understanding can be seen in the repetition of the motive, framed by the same "filler" drum-roll that frames the B cadence (and indeed all discrete motivic units in the piece). The alert dancer, if he can hear the drum clearly, should notice that the emphasized t? (high-pitched) stroke, which in B matched his leap to clash sticks every three beats (beats 3 and 6), is now falling at two-beat intervals, on beats 2 and 4, and, as the remainder of A3 unfolds, on beat 7 of what has become an eight-beat cycle. The second half of A3 can be seen as a re-expansion of the first half of B from three to four beats, in a chiastic arrangement of motivic material (shown by the arrows in Figure 14). The two features we have noted here - cyclic repetition and compression/ expansion of material - are not unique, in Newar music, to Gh?tagisi, but they are prominent features of this piece. What "meaning" could we associate with them? Are they "purely musical" aspects of structure, or can we link them with other contextual domains? Newar informants are unlikely to provide an answer to this question, since matters of musical structure are seldom verbalized. The question can at least be considered, however, in relation to the G?ij?tr? festival, other Newar music and other aspects of Newar and South Asian culture. The cyclic structure of Gh?tagisi is no doubt partly conditioned by the need to accompany a continuous procession, where the time to be filled between beginning and end is variable and unpredictable. But it may be ultimately linked with the circular route of the procession itself. Music played in other processions in Bhaktapur is seldom cyclic to the same extent. For example, funeral processions begin at the house of the deceased and end at the burning gh?t by the river; they do not return (Wegner 1988). The nay butchers who provide musical accompaniment for funeral processions play a sequence of six pieces at different stages of the route, defined by a sequence of landmarks such as street crossings. Each piece is repeated as many times as necessary to reach the next landmark, and some pieces are repeated at different</page><page sequence="24">202 R.

Wegner (1988: 56ff.) documents the sequence as: ABC, ABDE, AB, ADF (the last piece, F, is played at the gh?t). High-caste Buddhist processions at G?l? make a circuit of five vih?ras (monasteries), but play a different piece between each vih?ra and the next;26 they can do so because the stages of the journey are clearly demarcated by the vih?ras, at each of which the procession halts for some time while special pieces are played, and because they are not accompanying a dance that continues throughout. Given that not all processions are circular and not all processional music is cyclical on the largest scale, why are these the case with Gh?tagisi? There are, I suggest, two answers. One is that clockwise circumambulation, pradaksin?,27 is a conventional Hindu-Buddhist method of worshipping a sacred object, in this case, the town of Bhaktapur itself, which is kept on the worshipper's right hand {daksina). The processional route {pradaksin? path) does not mark the periphery of the town nor is it a regular circle: it traces a very irregular course through the higgledy-piggledy street plan, leaving many important areas and temples on the left hand rather than the right. But it has no beginning or end point: each G?ij?tr? group both joins and leaves the route at the point nearest to the home of the bereaved family. A similar endless</page><page sequence="25">Ethnomusicology Forum 203 procession along the same route occurs at the New Year festival of Bisk?h, involving music groups of all kinds. A second answer, following from the first, is that the procession passes through and involves the whole town, unlike many other rituals or performances that emphasize the distinct identity of different neighbourhoods, temples or other locations. G?ij?tr? is an act of communal commemoration by the whole of Bhaktapur, not just by individual families or neighbourhoods. Informants stressed the consolation provided to the bereaved by the realization that many families throughout the town have suffered a similar loss, and the myth of origin also emphasizes this idea. It is perhaps only if t?h?s?s parade round the whole town that this communal consolation can be enacted. The cyclical, repetitive structure of performance underlines this aspect of contextual meaning, instead of emphasizing (as in the case of funeral and G?l? processions) the distinctness of different localities. The architectonic structure of Gh?tagisi music, with its metrical contraction/ expansion, can likewise be linked with other domains of Newar culture and experience. A common element is the quality of enclosure: section B of the music is "surrounded" - i.e. temporally preceded and followed - by section A. Each musical section is self-contained (can be repeated an infinite number of times), but one can also progress seamlessly from one to the other and back, or from B further "in", to the dyahlh?ygu. Circumscribed spaces, hierarchically enclosed by larger spaces, are a fundamentally important aspect of lived experience in Bhaktapur, and are often marked by music, dance or ritual means; they include neighbourhoods, whose centres and boundaries are marked annually by the Navadurg? dancers; the Upper and Lower divisions of the town, celebrated by an annual tug-of-war; and the city of Bhaktapur itself, its boundary protected by a ring of eight mother-goddess {asta-m?tr k?) temples. One might also compare the transitions from ordinary to festival time that pervade the Newar calendar, each major festival starting with preparatory rituals,28 reaching a climax over a number of days and subsiding again through concluding rituals into ordinary time. Festival time is enclosed by ordinary time, from which it emerges and into which it re-merges. Linked with the shared elements of cyclicity and enclosure is a third: intensification of power and experience. Short peaks of emotional, physical and/or religious intensity pervade Newar cultural manifestations. One might cite the excitement of the crowd - especially children - at a street corner as a long-awaited god-j?tr?29 comes into view, is briefly visible (accompanied by loud music) and passes quickly out of view for another year, or the near-hysteria with which the Navadurg? dancers are greeted annually at the festival of Mvahan?, when they emerge, one by one, after long delays, from the minute temple of Brahm?yanl, wearing their newly consecrated masks. In Gh?tagisi, the transition from sections A to B results in an increase of rhythmic energy, reflected in the more vigorous movements of the dancers and reflecting the social or religious significance of the location; the intensity peaks and is dissipated as the musicians move back into section A, through the simultaneous contraction and expansion of rhythmic sch?mas.</page><page sequence="26">204 R. Widdess There may, therefore, be qualities that are common to music and other domains of experience, which help to explain why music assumes particular forms in particular contexts. To pursue them a stage further, the qualities of cyclicity, enclosure and intensification are combined, not only in musical structures such as Gh?tagisi, but also in certain spatial, architectural and cosmographical structures that pervade Hindu-Buddhist culture in general and Newar culture in particular. To posit a link between these musical and non-musical structures is inevitably somewhat speculative, and is not overtly attested by Newar informants. But the non-musical structures concerned are too familiar to ignore, and if their relevance is accepted, they reinforce and deepen the contextual "meanings" that we have already identified for Gh?tagisi. A key concept is that of the m?ndala (Newari mandah): a pervasive visual symbol, of ancient Hindu-Buddhist origin, in which the cosmos is represented as a series of concentric, symmetrical areas, of square, triangular and/or circular geometry (see, for example, the Buddhist mar?dala shown in Figure 15). This cosmogram shares with Gh?tagisi performance the qualities of cyclicity/circularity, enclosure and intensifica tion. The symmetrical zones of a m?ndala are concentric, diminishing in size towards the centre; the most powerful deity inhabits the smallest, central area (Figure 15). According to David Gellner (1992, 45ff), the m?ndala is an especially pervasive symbol in Newar culture, through which physical, social and religious space is constructed or imagined. It serves as a model of the caste system, of the organization of the city and temple, of the layout of household space and water fountains, and of space generally, from the macro- to microcosmic scales: the m?ndala model applies equally to the universe as a whole, to the country Nepal,30 to each city, to each temple and shrine, and Tantrically, to the worshipper's own body. The realization of one's own identity with these larger designs is the attainment of salvation. (Gellner 1992, 190f.) The m?ndala concept is especially relevant to our enquiry because Bhaktapur itself, the very ground on which Gh?tagisi is performed, is considered to be a m?ndala, despite its apparent asymmetry on the map (Levy 1990, 153-6).31 The processional route is imagined to be circular, and to be one of a number of concentric circles or other geometric figures of which the town is constituted. Of these, the outermost is marked on the ground by the protective shrines of the "eight mothers" {asta-m?trk?), located very approximately at the points of the compass around the periphery of the town. The centre is marked by the shrine of a ninth goddess, Tripurasundarl. Between these extremes the gods in their temples inhabit different concentric zones, as represented for example in Figure 16, where the zones are given rhomboidal and triangular forms;32 the same organizing concept underlies the spatial distribution of human inhabitants, with high castes living in the central areas (near the former royal palace), and lower castes progressively further out (Gutschow and K?lver 1975, 48-9). Robert Levy writes that Bhaktapur's representation as a m?ndala evokes a special concept of sacred space, comprising "imaginatively perfected forms [that] exist in real space like a geometric image reflected in a distorting mirror. But</page><page sequence="27">Ethnomusicology Forum 205 Figure 15 M?ndala of Vajravali, Buddhist, Himalayan region a 1430 (detail).

Reproduced by permission. people have no trouble finding their way about in one or the other kind of space, or for that matter, in both at the same time" (1990, 156). Walking or dancing round this m?ndala thus re-creates it in an annual observance linked to themes of life and death, themselves conceived as cyclical in Hindu Buddhist eschatology; the playing of dyahlh?ygu at precisely 16 points around the circuit (according to Harigovinda Ranjitkar) strongly indicates an iconic cosmolo gical symbolism. One might expect that conscious engagement with the m?ndala symbol would be more typical of some sectors of society, such as ritual specialists, astrologers, artists and architects, than others, such as farmers. But, in its visible forms, whether consciously recognized or not, it is inescapably present to anyone living in Bhaktapur. The multiple roofs, contracting upwards, of a Newar temple are a m?ndala projected into three dimensions (Slusser 1982, 1:145); the ground plan of concentric squares or rectangles on which it is based may also be extended downwards into a stepped, pyramidal plinth on which the temple stands. The Ny?tapola Temple, the most</page><page sequence="28">206 R. Widdess Figure 16 Representation of Bhaktapur as a M?ndala, 20th Century (coll. G.-M. Wegner, reproduced by permission; photo: Richard Widdess 1999). impressive articulation of this mandalic form in Bhaktapur, dominates the central square of the town (Figure 17).33 In both the structure of Gh?tagisi and the m?ndala we encounter not only the quality of enclosure, but a special type of enclosure characteristic of South Asian culture generally, namely the hierarchical enclosure of similar or equivalent spaces or things, such as stories contained within other stories, or lists where each term encompasses the preceding or following ones (Ramanujan 1990). But the quality that particularly links musical and spatial structure here is that of intensification, and here again we can find confirmation in a wider South Asian perspective. The m?ndala and forms based on it such as the temple represent an intensification of power towards the central, smallest area, which encloses "the radiating power of the central divinity" (Snellgrove 1987). The structural compressions of the Gh?tagisi music, and similar musical examples, effect an analogous intensification. "Intensity" has been noted as a pervasive feature of South Asian music by Henry (2002), who defines it as "the generation of intense feeling in its listeners or participants", achieved by a variety of musical means including acceleration, increasing rhythmic density and complexity, increasing volume, higher pitch, etc. Of particular relevance here is the type of intensity achieved by "progressive shortening of the [rhythmic/metric] cell" and</page><page sequence="29">Ethnomusicology Forum 207 Figure 17 The Ny?tapola Temple (1702), Bhaktapur (photo: Richard Widdess 1988). analogous forms of rhythmic diminution. Examples of this procedure include the lay b?t of North Indian dhrupad (Sanyal and Widdess 2004, 239ff.), the South Indian classical trik?la (Widdess 1977) and the pancav?dyam instrumental music of Kerala, in South India. In an example of the latter recorded by Killius (2002) an initial structure of 1792 beats is proportionally reduced in nine stages to seven, and finally three-and-a-half, beats.34 In Keralan tayampaka drumming, the principle of metrical diminution is termed the gopuram principle by its performers (Groesbeck 1999): the gopuram ("cow's gate") is the tall, pyramidal tower over the gateway of a South Indian temple (Figure 18). Here we find explicit recognition of a space-time, architecture-music homology that remains unspoken in Bhaktapur. While quasi-mandalic forms may be understood as a "given" of Hindu-Buddhist culture, their cosmological implications assume a particular relevance in the context of G?ij?tr?. Victor Turner (1982, 27) writes that cosmological symbolism may underpin the apparent subversions of social order typical of liminal or liminoid states. The significance of cosmology in the context of Hindu mortuary ritual is discussed by Parry (1994, 30f.). The body, he argues, is identified with the cosmos; cremation and immersion of ashes in the river constitute a sacrifice that destroys both the body and the cosmos, and simultaneously effects their re-creation: "Since the</page><page sequence="30">208 jR. Widdess Figure 18 Gopuram, Ekambaresvara Temple, K?nc?puram, Tamil Nadu, 17th Century (photo: Richard Widdess 1996). body is the cosmos the last rites become the symbolic equivalent of the destruction and rejuvenation of the universe. Cremation is cosmogony; and an individual death is assimilated to the process of cosmic regeneration" (italics in original). If G?ij?tr? marks the end of the departed souls' post-cremation journey, it is not surprising if its music and dance articulate both the disorder of the liminal and at the same time the re-establishment of a cosmic, social and emotional order. In exploring our initial question - how does musical structure relate to the meanings of G?ij?tr? as a cultural event? - we have suggested a dual role for the musical elements of Gh?tagisi. At one level, the music, understood as dynamic performance rather than static structure, enables the overt expression of a variety of contextual meanings. These include the eschatological and emotional meanings shared with the ritual of the G?ij?tr? procession, anti-structural meanings of a more socio-political nature mainly expressed by the dancers, and articulation of the social and religious configurations of urban space. At another level, the Gh?tagisi music can be linked to concepts and qualities typical of experience in Newar, and indeed South Asian culture in general: the centred, symmetrical, bounded and hierarchical organization of cosmic and urban spaces, the concentrated intensification of power</page><page sequence="31">Ethnomusicology Forum 209 and emotional experience, the co-inherence of life and death, of individual and universe, of destruction and re-creation. Thus the analysis of musical structure in relation to its context can help us to describe "both music and its cultural background as dialectically interrelated parts of a total system" (Blacking 1971). The metaphor of "structure", suggesting as it does a solid, static, constructed entity of fixed, two- or three-dimensional form, may be a misleading one in view of the temporality, intangibility, linearity and contingency of musical performance. But, while focusing on performance and the processes of re creation that performance entails, we should recognize those aspects of musical patterning that transcend the perceptual present and inform musical sections, pieces, repertoires, genres and systems, and which thereby constitute metaphorical structures - especially those that resemble meaningful patterns in other cultural or sensory domains. While it may be problematic to map musical and spatial patterns onto each other directly, it can be argued that deeply rooted patterns of emotional and cognitive experience provide the common ground between analogous structures in musical and non-musical domains. At the very least, we should not neglect to interrogate musical structures for links to their context and clues to their meaning.

[2] DeVale (1991) similarly uses this term to denote an analogy between (a) architectural structures, their spatial arrangement and movement in relation to them and (b) musical instruments and the musical structures realized through performance. [3] Information from Dr ?utan Sharma. For an outline of Newar culture and history, see Slusser (1982). The classic ethnographic study of Bhaktapur is that of Levy (1990). [4] In a brief survey of stick-dances in South Asia, Bake (1970) points to both agricultural symbolism and ritual elements. Thompson (2000) suggests martial origins for the Gujarati d?ndi?r?s dance, which is more complex in choreography than Gh?tagisi. A more complex stick-dance also survives in Bhaktapur, called m?kah py?kh? "Monkey Dance", which Bake observed in 1931 and 1956: it features two sticks per dancer, elaborate costumes and a</page><page sequence="32">210 R. Widdess complex choreography similar, perhaps, to that of dandi?r?s. It is performed in G?ij?tr? processions and on other occasions by children of Casukhyah, Bol?che, Bh?rb?co and Call tvah (G.-M. Wegner pers. comm.; S. Bailey pers. comm.). Anderson refers to "rice-planting pantomimes" (1971, 101) and other agricultural symbols. [5] In Ba?aras, this scenario is acted out with a real cow as part of post-cremation ritual (Parry 1994, 199f.). [6] I am grateful to Shamsher Nhuchen Pradhan for this information. [7] I am indebted to Gert-Matthias Wegner for this observation. [8] Anderson (1971, 103f.) attributes this event to the reign of Pratap Malla, King of Kathmandu (r. 1641-74). Residents of Bhaktapur prefer to associate the story with their own former rulers. [9] Anderson (1971, 101) does not specifically mention the performance of stick-dances in the G?ij?tr? procession. Levy, whose fieldwork was conducted in 1973-6, mentions the term ghet?ghest mhetegu, "to play gh?taghest \ as denoting the carnival aspects of G?ij?tr?, but does not mention stick-dances, and none are visible in his photographs (1990, 446). It seems likely therefore that the Gh?tagisi stick-dance has become a popular component of G?ij?tr? only in the late 1970s or 1980s. Levy explains ghet? ghest as "the sound of a particular kind of drum beat", suggesting that it primarily denotes the music independently of whatever dance or pantomime it accompanies. [10] Similar groups of grotesque musicians and dancers appear in the retinue of other Hindu deities and in Newar Buddhist iconography (Ellingson 1990, see his figure 4B). According to Anderson (1971, 104), Buddhists in Bhaktapur interpret the Gh?tagisi gana as the demons of M?ra who attempted to disturb the Buddha's meditation. [11] This is the date mentioned by a number of informants. [12] This was repeated in 2005 (S. Bailey pers. comm.). [13] I am most grateful to Richard Wolf for drawing my attention to some of these cross-cultural parallels, of which only the most cursory discussion is possible here. [14] This would also explain the of use dh? by the Baila py?kh? dance troupes that emerge after G?ij?tr?, and by Buddhist groups at their festival of Gula two weeks later. [15] S. Bailey (pers. comm., quoting Harigovinda Ranjitkar). [16] This orientation is reversed by Buddhist musicians. [17] For the phonetic basis of this oral notation see K?lver and Wegner (1992). [18] This section is called cal?k, "quick", but I am not aware of any corresponding name for the A section. [19] Alternatively, the (ni) in this context can be played on the low rather than the high head, again for ease of playing at speed. [20] Players often begin with the line here numbered A3, and Bailey (pers. com.), following Harigovinda Ranjitkar, argues that A3 is therefore the "first" line. In a cyclic rotation of lines it is of course difficult to say which, if any, is truly "first" (or last), an ambiguity that conventional notation cannot help but resolve in one way or another. However, Al corresponds to the first line of the G?ij?tr? song (see later). It is therefore in some sense "first", even if sometimes preceded in performance by A3 as an introduction. [21] Changing to the B section is also a useful strategy for keeping the dance going if the group is temporarily prevented from proceeding by the press of people in the road ahead (S. Bailey pers. comm.). A further dimension of meaning is suggested by the Balinese practice of rotating the funeral tower at cross-roads, to the accompaniment of loud and fast music, in order to disorient the soul (lest it attempt to return home) and also confuse the malign spirits haunting such places (Bakan 1999, 72f.). [22] A different dyahlh?ygu is played on l?l?kht m the context of devotional singing (d?ph?), but this is too long to play in the processional context, lasting as it does around 10 minutes in its most extended version.</page><page sequence="33">Ethnomusicology Forum 211 [23] Bailey points out (pers. comm.) that this programme is somewhat simplified, as changes from A to B and from A to dyahlh?ygu can occur at any point in the music if circumstances demand. Also, as has already been noted, the dance music may begin with A3 rather than Al. [24] This example is chosen here as the most easily quotable illustration of McClary's argument, from among a number of detailed analyses in her book. [25] The second t? is optional or can be replaced by filler strokes such as drkha or t?gh?. [26] Information from Simonne Bailey, in whose company I was able to observe this procession in 2004. [27] Sanskrit: from daksina, "right hand", because the object of veneration is kept on the worshipper's right while circumambulating. [28] One of the first indications that a festival or sacred season has started may be the singing of d?ph? groups in the early morning. The G?ij?tr? festival begins with a first stick-dance procession on the afternoon of the previous day, which leaves the Darb?r (palace) Square and takes one round of the processional route; the end of G?ij?tr? as a ritual is signalled by the procession of Bhairav and his companions, though its music and dance continue into the following days. [29] A procession, usually annual, in which an image of the deity is brought out of the temple, placed on a palanquin and paraded through the streets, usually preceded and followed by temple singing, dhitnay drums and/or other music. [30] That is, the Kathmandu Valley, to which the name Nepal originally applied. The valley is often referred to as Nep?la m?ndala. [31] Similar cosmographical symmetry is imaginatively imposed on other Newar towns and on places elsewhere in South Asia: an example is the city of K?sl (Ba?aras), which is conceived as a series of nested zones, of increasing sanctity towards the centre, identified with both the cosmos and the human body (Eck 1983, 146f.; Parry 1994, 15f., 30f.). [32] From an original in the collection of G.-M. Wegner. For a similar map with full explication of the symbolism, see K?lver (1976). See also the m?ndala-map of Bhaktapur reproduced in Levy (1990, 154). [33] It is also pictured on banknotes. Parallels between musical and architectural or other mandalic forms in South and Southeast Asia have been suggested by Wegner (1986a), Ellingson (1981) and DeVale (1991).
