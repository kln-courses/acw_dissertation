<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XLI, No. 4 October, 1931 THE MONIST WORLD GEOMETRY IN this essay I shall discuss a point of view in physics which may be characterized by the term World Geo metry. By way of introduction I shall first outline the general character of physical theory. The problem of physical science is the construction of concepts of things, characters and processes which will serve to describe, interpret and order reality from a se lected point of view. Things and phenomena considered as instances of physical characters and processes consti tute the physical world. The most general characteristic of physical reality is that it is ordered in space and time. A more specific classical definition characterizes the physi cal world in terms of the concepts of matter and energy. However, in order to give a detailed exposition of the concept of physical reality we must ultimately have re course to examples of physical properties and processes which one may assume to be known. Thus-the motion of material bodies, the elastic properties of bodies, the pro pagation of light, the phenomena correlated with changes in the hotness and coldness of bodies, electric and mag netic actions, the structure of matter,-these exemplify the content of the physical world. A physical theory is the systematic representation of certain characters of physi cal reality. The goal of physical science is a unitary sys tem of physical theory. IRead before the Kosmos Club in Berkeley, Cal, Nov. 3, 1930. The essay is based in part on a philosophical study of physical theory which is shortly to appear in the form of a volume entitled The Nature of Physical Theory.</page><page sequence="2">482 THE MONIST We conceive of the elements of the physical world as bodies which undergo certain physical processes. Thus the concept of body is fundamental in physical science. One refers to moving bodies, hot bodies, luminous bodies, electrified bodies, sounding bodies, etc. One distinguishes between macroscopic or large-scale bodies, such as a billiard ball, and microscopic or fine-scale bodies, such as an atom or electron. For the purpose of the present dis cussion it will be sufficient to think of a body as a more or less permanent entity in space and time. Physical prop erties and phenomena thus presuppose bodies in space and time. Thus we see that the concepts of space and time are fundamental in physical theory. Space and time consti tute the most general forms or qualities of physical bodies and phenomena. In classical physics a distinction was drawn between spatial and temporal properties, on the one hand, and physical properties, such as inertia, force, electrification, etc., on the other. Space and time were thought of as independent of the things in space and time. Thus in classical physics space and time are the framework or background of physical phenomena. The characteristic of the physical theory which I have called world geometry is that the independence of spatio-temporal and physical properties disappears. Indeed, the physical properties are reducible to space-time properties. In order to contrast the classical and geometrical points of view I shall briefly review the principal historical types of unitary physical theory. The textbooks of physics divide the subject into various branches, such as mechanics, heat, electricity and magnetism, light, etc. A physical theory is the representation in concepts of selected physical charac ters and processes. In dynamics we have a set of physical</page><page sequence="3">WORLD GEOMETRY 483 concepts which serve for the general description of the mo tion of bodies and the conditions of changes of motion. In electrodynamics we represent electrical and magnetic properties of bodies and correlated phenomena. In ther modynamics we have a very general description of the physical order in which thermal properties and phenomena are the principal objects of interest. However, the driv ing force of physical science has been the attempt to con struct a unitary representation of the physical world. One endeavors to interpret the concepts of one theory in terms of the concepts of a fundamental theory. The principal unitary theories have been the mechanical conception of nature, the electrodynamic conception of nature, the geo metrical conception of nature. The first, most sustained, and most detailed attempt at a unitary system of physics was the mechanical concep tion of nature. I distinguish between the mechanical con ception of nature and materialism. Materialism is the ex tension of mechanical concepts to all characters of reality. According to the mechanical conception of nature the fundamental physical phenomenon is that of a body in motion. The primary physical character of a body is its mass. The acceleration of bodies is attributed to the ac tion of force. Now in dynamics the concept of force is general, so that instances of force are weight, the stress in an elastic body, electric attraction, magnetic attrac tion, etc. The mechanical conception of nature is charac terized by the choice of certain kinds of force as fun damental in terms of which other forces are to be ex plained. Thus the mechanical theory is based upon the concepts of space and time, the concept of mass and the con cept of mechanical force. Physical phenomena are de</page><page sequence="4">484 THE MONIST scribed or explained in terms of bodies having mass and acted upon by mechanical force. What we understand by the mechanical conception of nature depends upon our concept of mechanical force. In the historical development of the theory two types of force have been especially considered: first, action at a dis tance, which is exemplified by the Newtonian theory of gravitation; second, action by contact between material bodies, which is exemplified in the macroscopic theory of elasticity. Speaking generally, one may say that the typi cal mechanical forces are those operative in machines like the pulley, the wheel and axle, etc. Let us briefly review physical phenomena from the standpoint of the mechanical conception of nature. It is fitting to mention first those phenomena whose adequate description by a physical theory inspired the mechanical theory. The early history of dynamics was moulded to a con siderable extent by the program of finding a theory of the motions of the heavenly bodies. The system of celestial mechanics was constructed by Newton upon the laws of motion and the law of gravitation. In classical celestial mechanics the force of gravitation is conceived of as an action at a distance. The success of celestial mechanics inspired the attempt to interpret all forces as actions at a distance. The history of the theory of electricity and magnetism from the middle of the eighteenth to the middle of the nineteenth century was influenced by the attempt to find laws of force similar to the inverse square law in the theory of gravitation. In the early history of the the ory of elasticity it was attempted to explain stresses in terms of forces at a distance between the molecules con stituting an elastic body. Thus gravitational action at a</page><page sequence="5">WORLD GEOMETRY 485 distance gave rise to the concept of central force. In a very general sense a mechanical conception of nature can be based upon a theory of central forces. However, the development of physical theory has been guided by the at tempt to reduce action at a distance to action by contact. Thus the mechanical theory is best exemplified by the classical theory of elasticity. Solid bodies are characterized by the fact that if a body is deformed within certain limits by the application of some force, upon the removal of the force the body resumes its original size and shape. This property of solids is called elasticity. The elastic properties of bodies may be described with the aid of the concept of a stress which acts between contiguous parts of a body when it is deformed. Thus in the theory of elasticity we have the concept of an action through contact. The driving force of the mechanical conception of nature has been the at tempt to employ the concepts of motion, mass, and stress, which have been found applicable in the description of elastic and also fluid bodies, for the explanation of all physical phenomena. Thus the phenomenon of sound is correlated with vi brations in a material medium, which is usually air. A mechanical interpretation of light requires special hypotheses. The motion of observable material bodies is not sufficient to account for the phenomenon of light. Hence the application of the mechanical theory requires an hypothesis that visible qualities are correlated with not directly observable mechanical processes. Thus the ether was invented in order to provide a medium whose vi brations are correlated with the phenomenon of light. Investigation of heat phenomena during the eighteenth century led to the view that there is an indestructible sub</page><page sequence="6">486 THE MONIST stance, called caloric, which is responsible for thermal phenomena. However, the production of heat by mechan ical work suggested the theory that heat is merely a form of mechanical energy. Now the addition of heat to a body does not increase its macroscopic energy ; hence a mechan ical theory of heat demands the employment of atomistic concepts. Thus the detailed development of the mechanical theory of heat contributed to a kinetic-molecular theory of matter. The kinetic theory of matter was particularly suc cessful in giving a mechanical interpretation of the proper ties of gases. Thus the pressure of a gas is ascribed to the bombardment of the molecules against the sides of the con taining vessel. I conclude this brief sketch of the mechanical con ception of nature by a reference to electromagnetic phe nomena. In the early history of the theory of electricity and magnetism electric and magnetic actions were inter preted as actions at a distance. Faraday, however, con ceived of the medium as the seat of electric and magnetic forces. Maxwell then found the equations which represent electromagnetic phenomena as continuous processes in a medium. The mechanical conception of nature requires that one interpret electric and magnetic action in terms of mechanical stresses, strains, and motions of the medium. During the latter half of the nineteenth century a great effort was made to construct a satisfactory mechanical model of the electromagnetic field out of gyroscopes, pul sating spheres, etc. All these attempts have now been practically abandoned. To summarize:-In the mechanical conception of na ture the fundamental physical phenomenon is that of a material body in motion. The fundamental concepts are of space, time, mass and mechanical force. Mechanical</page><page sequence="7">WORLD GEOMETRY 487 force has been conceived of as an action at a distance be tween bodies, or as an action by contact of material bodies. The mechanical theory was the canonical system of the nineteenth century. Contemporary physics, however, is guided principally by an electrodynamic conception of na ture. Electrodynamics is the study of electric charges and of the electro-magnetic field which is excited by the charges. Like mechanical phenomena, electrodynamic processes oc cur in space and time. An electrically charged body has position in space and is surrounded by an electric field. Electric charges in motion constitute an electric current which excites a magnetic field. An electromagnetic field is a physical condition which is propagated throughout space with a finite velocity in accordance with laws ex pressed by Maxwell's equations. Thus the fundamental concepts of electrodynamics are of space, time, electric charge, electromagnetic field, etc. In place of mechanical force we have the concept of a force which arises from the action of the electromagnetic field upon the electric charges of bodies. The program of an electrodynamic con ception of nature is the interpretation of all physical properties and phenomena in terms of the concepts of elec trodynamics. A first step in the development of a unitary electrody namic theory of physics was the recognition of the fun damental reality of the electromagnetic field. We have seen that an attempt was made to find a mechanical basis for the electromagnetic field. During the second half of the nineteenth century the British physicists in particular sought to construct mechanical models for the interpreta tion of electromagnetic phenomena. However, all these mechanical models proved to be unsatisfactory. Gradually</page><page sequence="8">488 THE MONIST there ocurred a change in the point of view of physicists. The concept of the electromagnetic field began to be recog nized in its own right, to be considered as fundamental as the concepts of mass and mechanical force. However, the systematic extension of electrodynamics to the entire physical order was rendered possible by the discovery of the atomic constitution of electric charges. The final outcome of this development was that there are two kinds of electrified particle, electrons and protons. The charge of the electron is the ultimate unit of negative electricity. The proton is the nucleus of the hydrogen atom and its charge is the atom of positive electricity. The nuclei of other atoms are built up of protons and elec trons. A neutral atom, that is, one without an electric charge, consists of a positively charged nucleus and elec trons, so that the total charge is zero. A molecule con sists of a union of atoms. The kinetic molecular theory of matter thus becomes a first approximation to a micro scopic theory. The electron theory of matter gives a still more detailed analysis. The electrodynamic conception of nature was further extended by the electromagnetic theory of mass. The con cept of mass is the basic concept of a mechanical theory. Hence an important step towards a complete electrody namical theory of physics was the expression of the mass of an electrified particle in terms of the electromagnetic field. Again, it has been possible to give an electromagnetic theory of mechanical force. The typical mechanical force is that exerted across a surface between two contiguous parts of an elastic body. In the mechanical conception of nature electrical forces between charged bodies were interpreted as stresses in an elastic ether. In the electro</page><page sequence="9">WORLD GEOMETRY 489 dynamical theory, however, the electromagnetic field is assumed to be a fundamental reality. Hence the mechanical stresses in elastic solids are to be derived from electro magnetic forces. The possibility of an electromagnetic theory of mechanical force has been especially demon strated by the electrical theory of crystals. From this point of view a mechanical explanation of the electromag netic field in terms of an ether with elastic properties would involve a logical circle, for the elastic, mechanical proper ties are to be derived from the field. The electrodynamic theory became the legislative the ory of physics with the special theory of relativity. In order to construct a satisfactory theory of electrodynamics Einstein reconstructed the concepts of space, time and kinematics and eliminated the concept of an ether as a substratum for electromagnetic phenomena. The special theory of relativity implies that space and time are rela tive to a frame of reference. The mechanical conception of nature had presupposed a single space and a single time. The electrodynamic conception of nature has introduced the concept of a plurality of times and spaces. I have already pointed out that in the electrodynamic conception of nature the electromagnetic field is recog nized as a fundamental reality, and matter is thought of as constructed out of electrified particles. These results suggest the program of a detailed theory of the struc ture of matter and of its interaction with electromagnetic radiation. The development of a theory of matter and ra diation has led to the quantum theory. The outcome of the quantum theory is that our traditional concepts of space, time and causality are found to be limited in their appli cation to microscopic processes. However, it is not my purpose to take up the quantum theory. I shall assume the</page><page sequence="10">490 THE MONIST unrestricted applicability of the concepts of space and time in accordance with the theory of relativity. As I have just remarked, the special theory of relativ ity was an expression of the legislative character of elec trodynamics in physical theory. However, the theory of relativity proved to be the origin of a new point of view, the geometrical conception of nature. Before taking up the geometrical theory it is desirable to consider the question of the interpretation of physical theory. In the foregoing account of the mechanical and electrodynamical theories I have discussed physical con cepts as if the problem were merely one of the adequacy or inadequacy of concepts for the description and explan ation of physical phenomena. To a company of non-philo sophical physicists my exposition would seem to be fairly comprehensible. However, I hope to show that this char acter of my discussion is illusory. The introduction of radically new concepts in contemporary physics renders it necessary to consider the question of the significance of physical theory. In particular it seems to me to be im possible to understand the geometrical conception of na ture except in the light of a special theory of metaphysics. As a basis for the discussion I shall mention the view of Auguste Comte that every science passes through three stages of development. They are (i)the theological stage, (2) the metaphysical stage, and (3) the positivistic stage. Comte believed that it is possible to attain a positivistic stage in which a science is completely emancipated from theology and metaphysics. Comte's classification is un satisfactory partly because the physical significance of the fundamental concepts of any system of physics implies a metaphysical theory of nature. I am going to propose another classification. The his</page><page sequence="11">WORLD GEOMETRY 49I tory of physics may be subdivided into three stages. The sort of physics characteristic of these stages may be called (1) qualitative physics, (2) absolutistic quantitative physics, and (3) relativistic quantitative physics. The dis tinction between absolutistic and relativistic physics may also be expressed as that between realistic and nominal istic, or realistic and operational, physics. Probably the very first stage in science is the recog nition or assumption of the existence of a world of things. We recognize or assume things, we give names to them, we construct concrete names, etc. This preliminary stage belongs to prehistoric man. We who live in the historic period have inherited the conceptual apparatus which has been fashioned by prehistoric generations. The child is taught to apply certain fundamental concepts by his nurse. I remark parenthetically that this circumstance is respon sible for a definite separation between theory and practice. One may be able to apply a concept without understanding it. It is on account of this fact that there is a problem of the significance of physical theory. Now a science involves the explanation of phenomena and the analysis of the nature of things. More specifically, physics may be characterized as the search for causes and essences in the physical world. I shall sketch how the problem has been investigated, first qualitatively and then quantitatively. The first stage in physics is the qualitative explanation of phenomena and analysis of things of the physical world. This was initiated by the doctrine of animism and early Greek philosophy. I think that the dawn of science is characterized by the search for causes of phenomena. Explanation of phe nomena is in terms of causes which produce the phenomena</page><page sequence="12">492 THE MONIST as effects. Thus the primitive concept of causality involves the notion of production. The concept of production is de rived from our owm experiences. Thus we have the exper ience of exerting a force which produces an effect. Now the primitive concept of production was central in the animistic period which preceded and partially over lapped the period of early Greek philosophy. The doctrine of animism is that natural bodies are the abode of spirits. In the animistic period man explained the natural proces ses about him as the effects of living beings like himself. Greek mythology was a poetic expression of the theory of animism. The animistic, mythological period constituted Comte's theological stage of physical science. Thus the first phase of qualitative physics was the theological stage. This stage contributed something; the notion of produc tion, power, force, creation, generation, was the basis of the more sophisticated concept of causality. It is customary to characterize Greek philosophy as the beginning of a rational account of things. However, animism and mythology were the beginning of explana tion. The idea of production which we experience in our selves is extended to explain natural phenomena. From animism we have obtained the general application of the concept of force. It might be thought that physics has now completely transcended its theological origin. I am not convinced that this is the case. Thus force is often defined as that which produces acceleration. We think of one body as exerting a force upon another body. One says that a magnet at tracts iron, one speaks of chemical affinity. In the light of the positivistic interpretation of physics such expres sions belong to the theological stage of science. Thus even today the terminology of the concept of causality is remin</page><page sequence="13">WORLD GEOMETRY 493 iscent of the theological stage. And there are many who would insist that causality involves efficiency. Although I do not accept this point of view I admit that it is not pos sible to demonstrate that an animistic theory of nature is false. We have seen that the first period of the qualitative stage of physics was the animistic period which gave rise to the concept of force or cause. The second period of the qualitative stage was that of early Greek philosophy. The starting point of early Greek philosophy was the problem of substance. The theory of substance was the answer to the question, what is the nature of things, the essence, the fundamental stuff. Thus we pass from the consideration of the causes of phenomena to the analysis of things. It appears to me that the essential character of sub stance is that it has a permanent, intrinsic essence, the char acter of substance is something that it has in its own right. Thus Spinoza defined substance as the cause of itself. The initial hypothesis of the Greek philosophers was that there is one substance. Thus Thales said that water is the primary stuff. This means that what we call water is substance in its normal state. Thus the nature of things was described in terms of the concept of a primary stuff, or substance. This was the beginning of the problem of the constitution of matter. These early philosophers still believed in animism. Thus Thales said, "All things are full of Gods." Thus early Greek philosophy is characterized by animistic ex planation and substantialistic analysis. As is well known to students of philosophy, the prob lem of substance gave rise to the contradiction between permanence and change. Parmenides maintained that reality is one and changeless, change is an illusion. Hera</page><page sequence="14">494 THE MONIST cleitus taught that nothing is permanent, reality is in a state of flux. A solution of the dialectical problem of permanence and change Was achieved by the atomists. Empedocles in vented the notion of permanent element. He taught that there are four elements, earth, air, fire and water. Change is the combination and separation of the elements by the forces of love and hate. Thus in Empedocles we have the dissociation of substance and cause. Cause is still in terpreted anthropomorphically. The most important atomist was Democritus, who ex pounded an atomic theory which foreshadowed the modern point of view. Reality consists of atoms Which are qualita tively alike but differ in size and form. Observable phe nomena are due to the combination and separation of the atoms as they move in the void. There is a disposition on the part of historians of physics to say that the atomic theory of Democritus was a speculation which was not based upon experimental evi dence. It is thus claimed that his anticipation of modern conceptions was merely a happy guess. In my opinion this interpretation wholly misses the significance of Greek atomism. The import of the atomic theory is that it is a solution of a dialectical problem. We should think of the atomic hypothesis as a conceptual scheme for thinking self-consistently about reality which has both the charac teristics of permanence and change. The theory of Democritus was the origin of a distinc tion which proved to be important for modern meta physics. The size and shape of atoms really belonged to them; color, taste, odor, etc. were due to the effect of the atoms upon the sense organs. In modern terminology the distinction is between primary and secondary qualities.</page><page sequence="15">WORLD GEOMETRY 495 Thus the atoms were characterized by primary qualities, the secondary qualities were subjective effects of the ac tion of atoms. The distinction thus gave rise to a dualism in metaphysics. There was assumed to be a difference in grade of reality of qualities. The historians of physics tend to belittle the science of the Greeks. It is contended that they relied upon reason and dialectic instead of employing an experimental method. However, before experimenting one must learn how to an alyze things and phenomena. Before one can introduce quantitative methods one must first recognize that which can be measured. The Greek contribution was the fash ioning of a self-consistent conceptual apparatus for the representation of phenomena. To summarize:-The first period in physics was the qualitative period which had two phases. The animistic and mythological period gave rise to the notion of force or cause. Early Greek philosophy fashioned the concept of substance. I pass now to the quantitative period. This period is characterized by the measurement of properties and pro cesses. The distinction between the qualitative and quanti tative points of view,' may be illustrated by the two fol lowing statements : This rod is long. This rod is two feet in length. The phrase two feet expresses a numerical measure. It is not possible to make a sharp separation between qualitative and quantitative periods. There are elements of a quantitative point of view in the qualitative period. Measurements of length, time and weight were made in earliest antiquity. And even in the present quantitative period there are qualitative elements. Nevertheless, one may say that quantitative physics is essentially an achieve</page><page sequence="16">496 THE MONIST ment of modern times. It is true that quantitative physics was pursued by Archimedes, but the active development of systematic quantitative physics began during the Re naissance. The first period of quantitative physics is the absolu tists period. That which is measured is a measurable property, called a magnitude, of a quantity. The magni tude of a quantity is represented by a numerical measure. According to the quantitative point of view there exist quantities in reality whose properties can be measured. Magnitudes may be classified as extensive or intensive. The extension of a rod is an extensive magnitude. A par ticular extension may be considered to be constituted of component extensions. Intensive magnitudes are not ad ditive. If one adds together two bodies of the same de gree of hotness one obtains a body Which is as hot as the constituents. A constant extensive magnitude was interpreted to be the attribute of a substance. Thus a given material body has a constant quantity of material substance. Constant quantities were represented by constant numerical meas ures. The physicist, however, believed that he was in vestigating the properties of substances. Geometrical and temporal magnitudes, such as extension and interval of time, were interpreted as the properties of real things. This gave rise in Newtonian physics to the concept of absolute space and absolute time. Thus during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we have an absolutistic quantitative physics. I have employed the term absolutistic because the physicist believed that the properties of physical quantities were in trinsic to them and thus independent of the operation of measurement. The most general character of the physi</page><page sequence="17">WORLD GEOMETRY 497 cal world was constituted by absolute space and absolute time. Absolute space was in effect a substance and ab solute time was viewed as a flowing stream. Matter was material substance in space and time. It was joined by other substances, such as heat, electricity, and the ether. Thus physical investigation was directed to the measure ment of the mass of a body, that is, its quantity of mat ter; to the measurement of electric charge, that is, the quantity of electricity, etc. The essential notion of absolu tistic physics is that of realities, called physical quantities, which in certain cases are substances. In addition force was looked upon as a real activity which acts upon substances. An example is the force of gravitation. Physical proces ses were attributed to efficient causes. Thus this period employed the concepts of substance and cause from the qualitative period and added the concept of representation by measures. The concept of substance was inherited from Greek philosophy through the medium of Scholasticism. The absolutistic physics thus combined the Scholastic and met rical representations of reality. Physical substance may be measured, but it has an intrinsic essence which is quite independent of the mode of measurement. In terms of Comte's classification the absolutistic period belongs to the metaphysical stage of physics. In setting forth the absolutistic quantitative point of view I have taken care not to commit myself to a definite metaphysics. However, classical, that is absolutistic, physics was expounded in terms of a dualistic metaphysics, which was based upon the distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities were viewed as independently real and secondary qualities as subjective. Primary qualities are exemplified by extension, duration,</page><page sequence="18">498 THE MONIST mass. The essence of physical substance consists of con stant primary qualities. Thus mass is a property which constitutes the essence of the material substance in a body. Similarly electric charge is the property which constitutes the essence of the electrical substance in a body. The secondary qualities arise from the action of substances upon the sense organs. Physical substance was thus in terpreted as a reality independent of experience. The dualistic philosophy, which was expounded nota bly by Locke, was subjected to philosophical criticism. Thus Berkeley criticized the distinction between primary and secondary qualities and argued that all qualities are subjective. He thus rejected the interpretation of ma terial substance as the independent cause of subjective secondary qualities. Hume then criticized the concept of causality. On analysis of the relation of causality he failed to discover the factor of efficiency or production and ob served merely succession of qualities. In the latter part of the nineteenth century Mach ex pounded a metaphysics which is essentially that of Berke ley and Hume. The concepts of physical reality and cause are interpreted in terms of the data of experience. Real objects are complexes of sensations and causality is a func tional relation between phenomena. Since the beginning of the twentieth century philo sophical criticism of the concepts of classical physics has begun to be effective. The qualitative concepts of Berke ley, Hume and Mach have furnished the basis for the construction of an appropriate quantitative physics. This type of physics may be called relativistic. Alternative ad jectives are operational, symbolic, nominalistic. The point of view of Berkeley, Hume and Mach may be called</page><page sequence="19">WORLD GEOMETRY 499 Comte s positivistic stage ; relativistic physics is quantita tive positivism. Before explaining the relativistic point of view I wish to remark that all textbooks of physics are written from the absolutists point of view, and indeed, presuppose the dualistic metaphysics. The nineteenth century is said to have witnessed a revolt of science from metaphysics, but it was only a revolt from post-Kantian philosophy. The scientific rejection of metaphysics was a reiteration of seventeenth century dualism. The dualistic interpretation of physical phenomena was clearly set forth by Helmholtz and since then has been expounded by Planck. If philo sophical critics have sought to eliminate metaphysical, in the sense of non-empirical, elements from physics, the prin cipal obstacle has been the physicists, who generally are fundamentalists in metaphysics. So far as I know the complete relativistic point of view has been expounded only by a few authors. By way of introduction to the relativistic point of view I recall the previous distinction between physical proper ties and their measures. The absolutistic point of view, whether or not it is interpreted in terms of dualism, is that the propositions of physics directly express relations between properties. Thus in the proposition which states that speed is distance passed over per unit time, the words distance and time symbolize measurable properties; and speed is a property which is constituted by the correlation of distance and time. The presupposition of this interpre tation of the proposition is that we apprehend properties. The relativistic point of view is that the essential char acter of measurable properties is that they may be desig nated by symbols which are usually numbers. The propo sitions of physics express relations between numbers.</page><page sequence="20">5oo THE MONIST The basis of the relativistic point of view is the fact that for the most part we have no immediate experience of a specific character corresponding to a physical proper ty. I may ascribe color to a body on the basis of an im mediate experience. The physicist also ascribes mass to a body, but he has no immediate experience of a property called mass. The character mass is attributed to a body in virtue of its behavior under certain definable conditions. The conditions can be described so that a number, called the mass of the body, may be assigned to it. Likewise when we measure a force we observe the reading of a pointer of a spring balance. It is a general characteristic of the measurement of physical quantities that it con sists in observing that two points coincide at the same time as two other points. Thus if there is any nature of a property it is irrelevant. A thorough-going application of the empirical point of view leads one to the conclu sion that for quantitative physics a physical property is primarily something to which a number may be assigned. The physical property is characterized by the method of measuring it. The change from the absolutistic to the relativistic point of view* is indicated by the change in the meaning of the term physical quantity. From the absolutistic point of view a physical quantity is a particular reality; from the relativistic point of view a physical quantity is a number which is assigned to some reality. Consider, for example, the concept of electricity. The absolutistic view was that there is a fluid, called electricity. The popu lar term "juice" expresses our classical concept of electri city. As soon as one adopts an empirical point of view the absolutistic position becomes difficult. What is the char acter of juice? The character of juice can not be appre</page><page sequence="21">WORLD GEOMETRY SOI hended by our senses in the same way in which we ex perience the quality of a color. If we say that we know that juice is something* that produces certain effects, then it acquires the status of a fiction. Empirically all we know is that certain phenomena, such as we experience when we make a battery and connect wires to it, are correlated with other phenomena such as the motion of a magnetized nee dle. The quantitative formulation of the proposition that a current is flowing in a wire is that there is a method of assigning numbers such that certain relations are satisfied. The difference between the mechanical and electro dynamic conception of nature is then interpreted in the following way. In the mechanical conception of nature it is possible to set up as fundamental a certain number which is assigned to a body by certain methods. This number is called the mass. In the electrodynamic concep tion of nature a number obtained by a different method, the electric charge, is fundamental. On the relativistic point of view we forego entirely the possibility of appre hending some esoteric essence of matter or electricity. Thus relativistic physics eliminates the last vestige of Scholasticism from physics. After the foregoing long journey we are now ready to enter the promised land of the geometrical conception of nature. Classical physics is characterized by a separa tion between geometry and physics. Geometry is the study of the properties of space or of configurations indepen dently of the specific properties of bodies. Physics pre supposes the concepts of space and time and then studies the characters of bodies represented by the concepts of mass, force, temperature, electric charge, etc. The essen tial feature of the geometrical conception of nature is the reduction of physics to geometry. However, this is based</page><page sequence="22">502 THE MONIST upon the prior reduction of geometry to physics. Thus in an exposition of the geometrical point of view the first problem to be considered is, what is the object of ge ometry ? Geometry is frequently defined to be the study of the properties of space. In the first instance, however, geome try is the study of properties of configurations in space. Geometrical figures are exemplified by points, straight lines, circles, triangles, etc. A property of a figure is ex pressed by the proposition that the sum of the angles of a triangle is two right angles. The question now arises, what is the nature of these geometrical figures? There have been various answers to this question. The philosopher Kant taught that geometrical figures are constructed in pure intuition. Geometrical figures are formed by the mind independently of all experience and therefore geometry is universally and necessarily true. According to Plato geometrical figures are pure forms which are the objects of rational contemplation. Geo metrical figures are ideal entities which dwfell in a super sensuous realm. Geometrical physics is based upon the view that geometrical figures are configurations of par ticular bodies which are given in experience. Thus a point is a dot or a pin point; a line is exemplified by a ray of light, the edge of some solid body, a pencil mark on a piece of paper. Kant and Plato would say that these bodies merely guide the mind to the construction or contempla tion of the true ideal objects of geometry. The geometri cal physicist would contend that in so far as geometry has any content its propositions refer to configurations of par ticular bodies. Our next question is, how does the study of geometri cal configurations reveal the properties of space? In or der to answer this question wt must ask, what is space ?</page><page sequence="23">WORLD GEOMETRY Absolutists physics presupposed that space is inde pendent of things in space. A realistic theory viewed space as a medium in which things are embedded. Kant's ideal istic theory was that space is an a priori form of intui tion. The theory of geometrical physics is that space is the relational pattern of things which are said to be in space. The various things given in experience stand in spatial relations, such as, A is to the left of B, A is dis tant from B, etc. The system of such relations constitutes space. For this discussion I am primarily interested in the question, what is the structure of space? In order to an swer this question we must first consider what is meant by structure. If space is a medium then the structure be longs to the medium. However, I have proposed the view that space is a relational pattern of existing bodies. Now there exists in nature a certain class of solid bodies, called practically rigid bodies, such as iron rods, steel balls, hard wood, etc. The structure of space is defined in terms of the properties of configurations of such bodies. The proposition that space is Euclidean means that the proper ties of configurations of rigid bodies are expressed by the propositions of Euclidean geometry. Thus if I construct a triangle out of three straight wires, the sum of the angles is equal to two right angles. Hence the problem as to whether space is Euclidean or non-Euclidean is purely an empirical one. Now it is a fact of experience that to the first approx imation, at least, space is Euclidean. The Euclidean na ture of space may be expressed in the following way. Sup pose that we have given a set of equal unit rods. They are equal in the sense that if I place them alongside each other the ends coincide. Now it is an empirical fact that it is</page><page sequence="24">504 THE MONIST possible to fit twelve of the rods together so as to form a unit cube. Furthermore, a cubical lattice can be built out of unit cubes. It is a character of our experience that such constructions are possible. However, before Ein stein only a few people recognized that it was not neces sary. It is quite conceivable that a set of equal rods could not be fitted together to form a cubical lattice. Indeed, it is an essential feature of the relativistic theory of gravi tation that it is impossible to construct a cubical lattice in a strong gravitational field. If the equal rods do not fit together in a cubical lattice we say that space is curved. However, a critic might agree that it may not be pos sible to construct a cubical lattice in a strong gravitational field, and yet contend that this fact has no bearing on the structure of space. He might argue that space is to be dis tinguished from things in space and that the structure of space is not affected by the changes in bodies which are due to physical causes. Thus the distortion of unit rods by a gravitational field has nothing to do with the nature of space. My reply is that this argument presupposes the clas sical absolutistic concept of space as a substance or form which is independent of experience. Such a concept ap pears to me to be useless for the representation of phenom ena. The absolutist will reply that he has an intuition of this space. The attitude of the geometrical physicist is that such a concept is an empty one. However, it requires an enormous effort to cast off the irrelevant concepts of an inherited metaphysics. I have already remarked that if it is impossible to con struct a cubical lattice in a region it is said to be curved. I shall now explain the concept of curvature in greater detail.</page><page sequence="25">WORLD GEOMETRY SOS The concept of curvature is initially defined in the theory of surfaces. As a basis for discussion I shall as sume that a surface is embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. I consider first the space of a plane sur face. A plane is characterized by the fact that the proper ties of plane figures are expressed by the propositions of plane Euclidean geometry. Thus the sum of the angles of a plane triangle is equal to two right angles. A plane may also be described through the fact that it is possible to construct it in a lattice system out of unit rods. Such a lattice system constitutes a Cartesian coordinate system. An important characteristic of a plane is the relation of parallelism. A directed segment of a straight line is called a vector. In a plane a vector at a given point may be equal and parallel to a vector at some distant point. I turn now to a surface such as the surface of a sphere. Everyone would recognize this as a curved surface. The surface of a sphere may be characterized in various ways. There are no Euclidean straight lines on a sphere. One therefore introduces the concept of geodesic line as the shortest line between two points. On the surface of a sphere the geodesic lines are great circles. A spherical triangle has the property that the sum of its angles is greater than two right angles. A spherical surface may also be characterized by the fact that unit rods will not fit into a rectangular lattice system. However, the best method of describing the curva ture of a surface is in terms of the parallel displacement of a vector. The investigation of the geometry of a curved surface is based upon the fact that a small region of a surface is plane to the first approximation. Thus one may</page><page sequence="26">5o6 THE MONIST accept the concept of parallelism from plane geometry and apply it to the parallelism of two infinitely near vec tors on a curved surface. That is, given a vector at a given point on the surface one can construct an equal parallel vector at an infinitely near point. Then step by step one can transport the vector by parallel displacement over the surface. However the vector which is constructed after a finite displacement is not unique. Its direction de pends upon the path along which the parallel displacement is carried out. Thus a curved surface is characterized by the fact that there is no parallelism at a distance. Suppose that one transports a vector by parallel dis placement around a closed path. Then in a plane the initial and final vectors will be the same. On a curved surface, however, the direction of the final vector will be different from that of the initial vector. The curvature of a surface may thus be expressed by the change of direction of a vector upon parallel displacement. In this account of the curvature of the surface I have assumed that it is embedded in a three-dimensional space. Thus we can see intuitively that the surface is curved. However, a being who was confined to the surface would have no intuitive experience of the higher dimensions. He could, however, determine the curvature of the sur face by studying the properties of triangles, coordinate systems, or the parallel displacement of a vector. The curvature of the surface can be defined in terms of quan tities which are intrinsic to the surface. The appropriate ness of the term curvature is based upon the fact that we who have an intuition of the third dimension perceive the surface to be curved. From the standpoint of the ob server in the surface the empirical fact is that unit rods can not be constructed into figures having the properties</page><page sequence="27">WORLD GEOMETRY described in Euclidean geometry, it is impossible to form a Cartesian lattice system, and upon displacing a vector parallel to itself around a closed circuit jthe direction is different from the initial direction. Let us now consider a space of three dimensions. I have already explained that Euclidean space is character ized by the fact that a set of equal rods may be fitted to gether to form a cubical lattice. Since the properties of three-dimensional space are similar in form to those of a plane the three-dimensional Euclidean space is called plane space. A curved three-dimensional space is one in which the unit rods do not fit together to form a cubical lattice. The curvature may also be described in terms of the change in direction of a vector when it is transported parallel to itself around a closed path. Now the space of a surface, which we would intuitively recognize as curved in a third dimension, may be described in terms of certain quantities which are defined in terms of the properties of configura tions of unit rods. A three-dimensional space in which the unit rods will not fit may be described by quantities which are similar in form to those for a curved surface. Hence we extend the word curvature to the three-dimensional case by analogy to the two-dimensional case. One must guard against the interpretation that the curvature of three-dimensional space implies the real existence of higher dimensions in which the curvature may occur. The curva ture of three-dimensional space means merely that equal rods do not fit together in this space as they do in Euclidean space. The notion of a physical space of higher dimen sions is at best a fiction. The analytical theory of curved three-dimensional space is as if the space were embedded in a plane space of six dimensions. I pass now to the consideration of space-time. The</page><page sequence="28">5o8 THE MONIST special theory of relativity provided the basis for the con cept of four-dimensional space-time. Every physical event has position in a spatial order and in a temporal order. In order to describe an event four quantities must be as signed, three for space and one for time. Space-time is the manifold of events. It must be emphasized that the concept of four-dimen sional space-time does not imply the reduction of time to space, and thus does not imply the discovery of the fourth dimension of space. The statement that the physical world is four-dimensional means that four independent numbers are necessary to specify an event. Furthermore, the ana lytical theory of the special theory of relativity is some what similar in form to that of a fictitious four-dimen sional space. It is therefore convenient to employ geo metrical language in describing the space-time world. Thus in the special theory of relativity space-time may be called plane ; in the general theory of relativity space-time is curved if it is the region of a gravitational field. The analytical theory of curved space-time is the same as that of a four-dimensional space which is embedded in a plane space of ten dimensions. However, this does not imply that there is a real space-time world of ten dimensions. From experience we know only the four-dimensional world. The structure of this world is determined by the properties of equal rods and similar clocks; the curvature of space-time is defined in terms of the behavior of equal rods and similar clocks. Relativistic physics presupposes the elimination of Scholasticism from quantitative physics. It is not sur prising, therefore, that the relativistic point of view has been attacked by the eminent neo-Scholastic, Jacques Maritain. He would say that I have failed to distinguish</page><page sequence="29">WORLD GEOMETRY between the significance and application of a concept, that I have confused the philosophy of nature and physics. In particular the Scholastic would contend that I have failed to distinguish between space-time and rods and clocks in space-time. However, the relativistic point is that space-time is merely the relational pattern of spatio temporal processes. More specifically, the structure of space-time is defined by the properties of rigid bodies and processes such as the motion of light and material parti cles. The concept of a curved space-time has made possi ble the partial realization of a geometrical conception of nature. The principal achievement has been a theory of gravitation. According to the Newtonian theory bodies move in an absolute space with a Euclidean structure dur ing an absolute time. An isolated material body moves in a straight line with constant velocity. The motion of a body is changed by the action of a force of gravitation. In the geometrical theory a gravitational field is a curved space-time region. A body moves in a gravitational field so that its path in curved space-time is a geodesic line. Thus the concept of force of gravitation is eliminated. The factors which define the curvature of a region replace the quantities which define gravitational force in classical physics. Thus the concept of efficient causality, which is anthropomorphic in origin, is eliminated from celestial mechanics. Some expositors of the theory appear to hold the view that a curved space-time constrains a body to move along a geodesic line. This mode of expression implies that space-time is a sort of substance which acts upon bodies immersed in it. Thus, although the relativistic point of view implies the elimination of the concepts of substance</page><page sequence="30">THE MONIST and cause, these concepts tend to reappear in a new form. Thus Scholasticism and animism will not down. I believe, however, that it is desirable to adhere strictly to the em pirical and relativistic point of view. The statement that a body moves in such a way that its path in space-time is a geodesic is merely a mode of description of motion in terms of space-time whose structure is defined in terms of rigid bodies and clocks. The curvature of space-time is determined by the dis tribution of matter. Now, whenever we discover a re lation between two quantities we may use the relation to define one of the quantities in terms of the other. Thus the quantities which apply to matter may be defined in terms of the quantities which define the curvature of space time. This point of view has been expressed by Einstein is, the properties of matter are definable in terms of spa in the statement that "space is eating up matter." That tio-temporal characters. This result achieves the defini tive elimination of the concept of material substance from physics. A satisfactory geometrical theory of gravitation was achieved by Einstein in 1916. Since that time the goal of investigation has been a unitary geometrical theory which will include electromagnetic phenomena. Weyl in 1918 thought that he had it in a theory in which the length of a line depends upon its position. The factors that de termine change of length upon displacement are correlated with the electromagnetic field. However, this theory did not prove to be satisfactory. Recently Einstein has proposed a new theory which he thinks will be successful. In the geometrical theory of gravitation it was assumed that the space-time continuum is curved. The curvature reveals itself in the fact that if</page><page sequence="31">WORLD GEOMETRY one displaces a vector parallel to itself its direction at some distant point will depend upon the path along which it is displaced. Thus there is no parallelism at a distance of two vectors in curved space-time. In the new theory Ein stein assumes that space-time is without curvature, and thus there is an absolute meaning to parallelism at a dis tance. However, the manifold without curvature has a new property which is called torsion. The new theory has not yet been completed. In particular the law of motion of a particle is lacking. Thus a complete geometrical physics is at the present time an unrealized ideal. It seems to me, however, to be the proper goal of a relativistic physics. Yet even if the ideal be attained it is likely to serve mainly as an abstract formulation of the system of physics. The absolutistic classical concepts have furnished the conceptual apparatus for most physical investigations. The absolutistic concepts constitute a conceptual system which seems to be congenial to our minds. It seems cer tain that the experimental physicist will retain the classi cal concepts in thinking about phenomena. And so I would conclude with this final word. Regardless of the philo sophical satisfaction that a thorough-going relativism pro vides it is likely that the ghosts of the metaphysical con cepts of substance and efficient causality will continue to walk the physical laboratory.
