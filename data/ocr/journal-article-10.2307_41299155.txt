<plain_text><page sequence="1">How Is Religion Causal - and What Is It, Exactly? Stewart Guthrie Sessions at the 1996 and 1997 meetings of the SSSR presented daunting double questions: how are we to define religion and how is it that religion can be causal in human affairs? I propose to answer both with variations on a single theme. I maintain (with predecessors from Spinoza and Hume to Melford Spiro and Robin Horton) that we can best define religion as a form of anthropomorphism.1 1 maintain further that the latter, with its cousin animism, is both an intuitive feature of thought and a potent cause of action. Last, I maintain that the cause of anthropomorphism and animism, and in turn of religion, is a perceptual strategy stemming from certain perceptual needs and interests.2 The interests in question concern interactions with any living beings, and especially with any humans, present in our environments. The central need in question is to detect the presence of such beings. This detection 1 .

Our perceptual strategy in this situation is to scan for features of humans and of other life and, on the basis even of sketchy evidence, to assume that we have found them. This strategy (as I have suggested elsewhere) is that of Pascal's Wager: one should guess that what is important is present because the potential gains of a correct guess outweigh the potential losses of an incorrect one.3 Thus, religion, in my view, ultimately is motivated by a deep-seated and highly adaptive orientation to discover certain real elements in our environment. That is also to say that at root it does not merely symbolize social organization, undergird desired social behavior, or express particular values. It can be, and often is, used in these ways; but what gives these usages credibility lies deeper than their varying immediate pragmatics. Religion therefore is causal in ways that go far beyond its contingent social settings. In these claims I am encouraged not only by Hume and company but also by what looks like support from my fellow contributors, Brian Smith and Benson Saler, as well as from this volume's instigator, Luther Martin, and from Karl Popper. Popper writes, "Objects can be classified, and can become similar or dissimilar, only ... by being related to needs and interests."4 His point is useful both for defining religion and for understanding its cause-effect relations. First, Popper's emphasis on needs and interests helps clarify the general process of definition, a problem especially acute for scholars doing cross-cultural comparison. As such scholars, we need definitions that start with our own folk categories, but that also usefully describe aspects of other people's categories. Our need to start at home seems inevitable. Roy Wagner (to borrow again from Saler) writes that, "What the fieldworker invents ... is his own understanding; the analogies he creates are extensions of his own notions and those of his culture, transformed by his experiences of the field situation." In a parallel vein, 3. Ibid.; Stewart E. Guthrie, "Anthropomorphism: A Definition and a Theory" in Anthropomorphism, Anecdotes, and Animals, ed. Robert W. Mitchell, Nicholas S. Thompson and H.

The more diverse the cultures, the greater the problem. Even within Western cultures the boundaries of our categories are problematic: does religion include communism, "civil religion, " or sports? Even if we decide it does not, it does have continuities with these and many other categories. Thus I endorse Saler' s point in Conceptualizing Religion: whatever definition we adopt, it cannot be absolute. No clear line between religion and neighboring phenomena can be drawn. Looking at many such phenomena, we cannot say clearly either that they are, or that they are not, religion. Instead, we can say only that they are more or less what we mean by this term: that they share more or fewer of a series of family resemblances with some exemplar. The prototype of religion (as of much else) for most anthropologists, as Saler points out, comes from their own Western cultural tradition, from which the very word religion stems. Thus the family resemblances in question are those of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Acknowledging that these Abrahamic religions are our starting point not only helps clear the air but seems to bolster the family-resemblance approach to definition. Still, I have two questions and a suggestion about family resemblance as a definition. The first question is, does the degree of typicality among the phenomena people call religion constitute a gradient, or is there clustering? For example, is there a group of relatively typical religions, from which a steep gradient proceeds to those phenomena that almost no one calls religion? Or is there only an even gradient all the way? (If the latter, one would have to wonder whether the notion of family captures anything significant, or whether the various less-exemplary cases are not just arbitrary samples along the booming, buzzing continuum of human experience.) If the metaphor of family does capture something, as I suspect it does, the second question is, why? Like all metaphors, it draws from a subject of thought in some source domain to suggest hitherto-unsuspected aspects of a subject of thought in some other domain. The degree of 5.

In the case of family resemblance, the source domain is biological descent, and the subject in that domain is the heterogeneous cluster of similarities shown by children of the same parents. Pursuing the metaphor, then, I would suggest that religions have family resemblances to the extent that they share some set of parents - namely, the forces that give rise to them. If that is so, then the apical ancestors of religion, its generative forces, are, first, our need to descry any humans (or humanlike beings) who may be in our environments, and second our chronic and pervasive perceptual uncertainty. These forces give rise not only to what we typically call religion, but also to an even larger family of perceptions that humans and humanlike beings are present when they are not. This assertion brings us to the question of cause. This question, however, is not separate from that of definition, but closely intertwined with it. Indeed, as Krymkowski and Martin put it, the "causal claim [may beg] the definitional question. What is required is not the explanation of some social effect by religious cause but, first, an explanation (and hence, definition) of religion itself."6 Here we have the horse where it should be, before the cart. Understanding why religion arises helps lead to a definition of what it is. Explanation and definition in this process are doubtless in a feedback relationship - perhaps we need a series of carts and horses - but surely definitions already imply theories, if only tacit and rudimentary ones. To put the question posed to us most broadly: what is religion's place in the web of human thought and action? Is it, for example, a dependent variable, perhaps a rationalization or other outgrowth of some more basic variable such as social structure? Or is it- as I think- a variable that is to some degree independent of local social relations, and one with its own origins, reasons, and force? If religion is in some significant way independent of particular social forms, how is this so and why does religion arise? Krymkowski and Martin, while suggesting that religion is dependent, leave that door open by suggesting also that we ask the "cognitive question of why human beings persist in [producing] beliefs at all."7 6.

Ibid, p. 196.</page><page sequence="5">How Is Religion Causal? 409 This cognitive question is, for me, central. My answer is that the causes of the family of religions (its "ancestors," to continue the metaphor) are, in Popper's phrase, a certain set of "needs and interests." The needs and interests I have in mind are broad and deep. Humans need, as do other animals, to sort the sensory world into kinds, and we need very much to discover those kinds that are alive. Among the foremost human interests are relations with a particular range of things and events - living and human ones - which we must identify as quickly as we can. However, we do this parsing of things and events in an endlessly ambiguous world. Right from the most elementary perceptions, our world is one of shadows, sounds, and motions that do not identify themselves but require interpretation. Interpretation, in turn, is chronically underdetermined, because any particular stimulus, from a sense of pressure on the skin to a humming in the ears to a motion or a glint in one's visual field, may have any number of possible causes. The intrinsic uncertainty of perception is exacerbated by the tactics of concealment and deception employed by humans and other animals. Hence interpretation always constitutes guesswork: what shall I make of this thump in the night, of that motion seen from the corner of my eye? Although this uncertainty is chronic and pervasive, we normally are unaware of it because the issues are handled unconsciously8: is there time to cross the street before the car passes? Is it hunger I feel, or thirst? Is that thunder or a jet plane? On home ground, most major pieces of our environment seem to fall readily into place. Only in unfamiliar circumstances, or when discovering a mistake forces us to change our actions, do we reflect consciously on choices of interpretation. Yet we make choices constantly, and from the ground up, assembling a coherent world from constantly shifting bits and pieces. (The complexity of this task has been revealed over the last few decades in part by the difficulties encountered in designing a robot that can visually negotiate even a simple path.) As Nietzsche wrote, "One may well admire man here as a mighty genius of construction, who succeeds in raising the superstructure of an infinitely complex conceptual cathedral on a moving foundation and, so to speak, on flowing water."9 Meeting the ambiguities and uncertainties of our perceptual world - and this is the heart of my argument - we have 8.

We do this, it seems, by scanning the world with a series of schemata, both learned and innate. The schemata are not equally important, but are in a shifting, situational hierarchy. High in the hierarchy, however, usually are schemata of living things, especially humans. These schemata constitute a default interpretation. Facing an ambiguous thing or event, we frequently think - or better, sense - "It's alive" or "It's human."10 In these perceptions we frequently turn out to be mistaken; but the strategy described is sound nonetheless, since its many little failures are more than compensated by its occasional big successes. For the camper, for example, every real sighting of a poisonous snake, and for the guerilla every sighting of a soldier, is worth many false alarms. For all of us, the unexpected discovery of something alive, and especially of an unexpected human or a human artifact in our environment, may repay any number of illusory discoveries. The cost of the mistake often is so low that it never comes to our attention at all: we absently brush a supposed insect from our arm without looking and never notice it was a loose thread. Because of the lopsided cost-benefit ratio of this perceptual game - because we are better safe than sorry - we err on the side of seeing what is important to see. That is, we see the world as more animated and more humanlike than it is. As Smith suggests, religion ultimately can be reduced to mostly social bases.11 However, I mean this not in the traditional symbolist, Durkheimian sense of social glue, which does not always seem to work - since religion often is divisive. Instead, I mean it more broadly and simply: people are important to people everywhere, whether in clans, castes or bands; whether friend or enemy, kin or stranger. We see humans everywhere, or think we do, because it is vital to see them wherever they actually are. The particular ways in which we do this are as varied as the aspects of life and humanity we know. We find organization, communication and moral order where they do not exist: figures in constellations of stars, signs in comets, and punishment in plagues. Many of the most important actions of the actual humans for whom we unconsciously look are symbolic, and hence we read an endless variety of natural phenomena as signs, omens, and portents. Finding these and other features of animacy and humanity in the world elicits correspondingly broad and varying 10. Gulhrie, 1993. 11. Smith, p. 6.</page><page sequence="7">How Is Religion Causal? 41 1 responses: prayer, sacrifice, vision quests, hells, moral codes, scrutiny of the heavens for messages and so on. Taken together, these views and the actions predicated on them constitute the features by which we see religions as a family. Because religions are as heterogeneous as our conceptions of humanity itself, they belong to a family that is open, as Saler has persuasively urged, not closed. (I hope that acknowledging this diversity will forestall the dread charge of essentialism.) Diverse though they are, however, they all appear as products of the perceptual strategy outlined. Religion as a cause, then, comprises varied thoughts and actions stemming from a particular kind of interpretation of the world: the world as humanlike. The project of interpretation in general is the project of producing meaning and order; and seeing the world as humanlike produces more meaning and order than does any other view. The meaning we thus experience does not stem so much from our egocentrism - as a common and facile reading has it - as from the fact that we are the most complex systems we know and therefore produce the most wide-ranging effects. Hence an apparent discovery of a humanlike system in the natural world explains effects of unparalleled diversity. For the same reason, actual humans are the most potent actors on our world stage, and detecting their presence has unparalleled pragmatic importance. Of such discoveries, as noted, some are only apparent. In retrospect, we can describe some of those illusory discoveries as religious - i.e., as beliefs that behind the scenes, gods are pulling the ropes. Even scholars who argue for a family-resemblance definition usually top their list of family traits with them.12 And even Buddhism, often cited as the paradox of an atheistic religion, in most of its forms actually has many gods. (If it did not, it still would be anthropomorphic because a central tenet, karma, attributes a human trait - moral retribution - to the universe.) As Saler, Krymkowski, and Martin note, the specific effects of religions in human life must be traced out in specific cases. But we can at least say safely in a general way that what we believe affects how we act. Consider two hunters in the north woods who see a dark shape on the trail ahead.13 12.

The other points out that it is a log, and they proceed. A classic example of the causal efficacy of religious belief is, at least in stratified societies, its relation to morality.14 The believability of gods, that is, may give purchase to moralists to use them as authorities and as threats. Heaven and hell, as an elderly farmer in Japan once told me, may be the "inventions of highly placed priests, to make people behave." Or again, if we think AIDS is divine retribution for sin, we are less likely to approve funding for medical research than if we think it is not. If asked how religion can be causal, then, we can say something about specific effects in specific cases. More generally, we can say that religion is causal in much the same way that broad secular systems of thought and action are causal. This is simply to say that, as we view the ambiguous and shifting shapes and events around us, our thoughts, feelings, and actions are formed by how we interpret them. We stand or kneel, indulge ourselves or sacrifice, and make war or peace, because we see these actions as suited to the world. As Sir E. B. Tylor noted over a century ago, one of the deepest of all schisms among world views is "that which divides Animism from Materialism": that is, the schism that divides perceptions that make the world alive and humanlike from those that disenchant it. The actions that result from these perceptions are similarly divided. As a strategic approach to definition, the present account has the virtue of remaining within an old and, in the Western world, still commonsensical tradition. This is that religion means beliefs and practices relating to deities: significant humanlike yet other-than-human beings. Such a definition is not counter-intuitive, at least to most writers of Western background. It also is concrete and operational; it requires no arduous examination of what might be meant by such terms as "ultimate values," "ground of being," or "sacred." What novelty my approach may offer lies not in its definition, but in its explanation of how religious beliefs and practices are part of a broader spectrum of related interpretations of the world, and why such interpretations are plausible and even compelling. 1 4.
