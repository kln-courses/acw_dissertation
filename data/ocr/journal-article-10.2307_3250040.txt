<plain_text><page sequence="1">BARBARA BREND AKBAR'S KHAMSAH OF AMIR KHUSRAU DIHLAVI- A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CYCLE OF ILLUSTRATION n the second half of the sixteenth century the studio of the great Mughal ruler Akbar produced numerous beautiful manuscripts. The early phase of the production is dominated by the gigantic Hamzahnamah, which contained some 1,400 pictures, and whose phantasmagorical narrative must have suited Akbar's youthful love for adventure. To this period also belongs a copy of Amir Khusrau's Ashiqah (the Mistress) a romanticized version of the tragic love story of Khizr Khan, son of a fourteenth century ruler of Delhi, and a Hindu princess, Duval-rin.i. This manuscript was copied in 976/i568-9, and contains two pictures only, thus suggesting that there was no existing tradition for its illustration.' Armir Khusrau Dihlavi, who lived from 1253-1325, embodied - as did Akbar himself - the fusion of cultures which was such a potent source of creativity in the Indian subcontinent. Khusrau's father was a Turk from the neighbour- hood of Kish, now in Soviet Uzbekstan, which later in the fourteenth century was to be the birthplace and the Shahr-i sabz (Green city) of Akbar's ancestor, Tim-r. Khusrau himself is thus known as 'Turk-i Hindustan' (Turk of India); he wrote principally in Persian, but also in Hindi. He was a courtier to a succession of great lords and sultans, but was also the disciple of the Shaykh of the Chishti order, Niz.m al-din Auliya, near whose tomb in Delhi he lies buried. Khusrau's most celebrated work, the Khamsah (Quintet) was composed between the years 698-70i/i298- i302 in acknowledged imitation of the Khamsah of the twelfth century Persian poet Niz.mi. Akbar's taste for epics and romances in Persian verse seems to have developed from the I580's. A Shahnamah, represented by a picture in the Keir collection, may be datable c. 1580, but the majority of such works fall into the period after 15 85, when the court was resident at Lahore, the earliest of this group being perhaps a small Khamsah of Niz. mi, also in the Keir collection, datable c. 15 87.2 The major poetical manuscripts, however, were produced in the later I 590s. Eight folios from a Gulistan datable c. I595, have recently been published by Smart and Walker (Cincinnati Art Museum, I95O.284-9o, I95I.299-3oo).3 A copy of the Baharistan * I should like to thank Mrs. L. Randall and Dr. Roger S. Wieck of the Walters Art Gallery for kindly giving me permission to publish W. 624, and Dr. Ellen S. Smart for much generous support. 1 New Delhi, National Museum, L. 53-2/7. N. M.

This copy is sometimes named after C. W. Dy- son Perrins, the owner who bequeathed it to the British Library (Or. 12208); 39 folios previously removed from it are in the Walters Art Gallery (W.6I3).5 The Khamsah of Amir Khusrau of the Walters Art Gallery (W.624) comes after an interval of one to two years in ila~hi 42/between i i March i597 and ii March IJ98.6 The Walters Art Gallery Khamsah, which has a fine lacquer cover, measures 285 x 195 mm, with a text area of 245 x 160 mm. It does not contain a formal statement that it was made for Akbar, but in view of its quality and the artists who contributed to it there is no manner of doubt on that score. It is dated, f. 2ii a, 42 in figures followed by alif for il*hi, and it is signed by Akbar's foremost scribe Muhammad H.usayn Zarin Qalam (Golden Pen), who had also copied the Baharistan. Four illuminators, H.usayn Naqqish, Khvijah Jan Shirizi, Lutf Allih Muzahhib and Mans ir Naqqish,7 worked upon its shamsahs (decorative rosettes) and its marginal illumi- nation. The names of 12 painters appear under illustrations: "Aliquli, Basawan, Dharmdis, Farrukh, Jaganat (Jagannath), Lacl, Mukund (Makand), Manohar, Miskins/Miskinah, Narsing (Narsingh), Sinwlah, and Stir Dis Gujariti.8 The manuscript now contains 21 illustrations; eight more in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (13.228.26-33, gift of Alexander Smith Cochran) are generally agreed to belong to it. The manuscript reveals the eight lacunae, and the original cycle thus comprised 29 pictures.9 The illustration is carried out in the mature and refined but lively style of the Lahore period, in which the hands of individual artists can be distinguished. Compositions are complex, and a very wide range of colour is used. Landscapes are rendered in considerable detail. There are marks of European influence, but also some iconographic links with the Sultanate and early Timurid periods. Since the Kamsah is not at present available in translation a brief amplification has been added to the pictures' titles offered below. 4 Mughal Miniatures of the Earlier Periods, Oxford (Bodleian Picture Book No. 9), I953, P. 4, pls. 8-12.

Artist: Basawan The Muslim walks from the left, while on the right of the picture the Brahmin, who is also moving to the right, but is almost prone, turns his head to look at him. Behind them is a wide and rocky landscape with distant figures walking left across a bridge. The picture has been included in an article on Basawan by S. C.Welch.1o Bas-wan's painting is characterized by dramatic vigour, psychological penetration, and a masterly use of plastic effects derived from European models. The essential action in the foreground is not emphasized in the usual way by being made the focus of the attention of spectators, but is instead isolated by the fact that subsidiary figures, including two black-buck, but with the exception of a small dog, turn their backs upon it: this seems to imply a comment by the artist, a disapprobation of what is going forward. The tension between the two central figures is evident, shown in the irritated backward glance of the Brahmin and the evasive gaze of the pilgrim; it is a confrontation which is closely paralleled in an illustration by Basawan to the Baharistadn manuscript showing a mullad and a dervish who is sewing patches on his coat; indeed the mullad would almost seem to be modelled on the same man." Both figures in the Armir Khusrau picture show great skill in the rendering of a three-dimensional effect in the drapery and musculature. The crawling Brahmin is typical of Basawan's daring acceptance of the challenge of an unusual pose, but is not entirely successful owing to a stiffness in the knees which suggests adaptation from an upright figure.12 The rocks have the sfumato character which is typical of Basawan.

Artist: Narsing The king and his courtiers ride in from the right; the king 'bites the finger of surprise'. The stoker sits on the left, in front of his furnace. In the lower left one of the king's followers is given water from a well. In the upper left there is a distant city. Narsing's figures, which are rather small and delicate, here have a doll-like jauntiness, which does not entirely suit a scene of passion. The anguished stoker seems merely peevish. However, the inclusion of the draught at the well suggests an attempt to deepen the emotional effect by a 10 S. C. Welch, 'The paintings of Basawan', Lalit Kald, X, 1961, fig. 4; also M.

The scene is set in a courtyard which is viewed over a foreground wall. The king is in a pavilion in the upper right; the two friends are in the lower left. The fratricide appears to be the central figure of a group in the lower right. The architectural scheme is rather awkward, notably owing to the fact that a wall of the pavilion seems to project instead of receding. The pale tone of the sandstone, together with the human figure type with heart-shaped face and shoulders held forward, suggests the work of Mukund. No. 28 also attributable. 4. 13.228.26, The king offers the widow his life A king has accidentally killed a child who had been set to watch crops. In expiation he offers the widowed mother a sword and a dish to take his life's blood, and another dish of money. The widowed mother is on the left of the picture, and the king, dismounted, on the right; the two dishes are on the ground between them. The boy lies in the left foreground above the patch of cultivation which he was watching. The background contains a rocky landscape. The picture betrays strong European influence in the modelling of the shawled mother, and the posture of the dead youth, which appears to derive from a Mannerist angel in flight. The picture has been discussed by Ettinghausen who saw in it a resemblance to work in the Baharista-n, and also by Welch who has attributed it to Miskin(ah).13 The attribution may be supported by reference to Miskinah's The unfaithful wife in the Baharistan which shows women in similar drapery, and also a similar handling of rock in small upright segments. See No. 25; No. 24 also attributable. 5" 3 5 a, Youth and Age (Pl.I) Age encounters Youth in a garden, and desires him, but being rebuffed, says that Youth will one day become as he is. Artist: La'l Youth in vermilion stands at the centre of the composition, at the intersection of the two water channels which form horizontal and vertical lines; he is moving to the left. On the left bent Age stands by a pool. Youth has two companions, and on the right of the picture a man washes his feet in a pool. Dark green foliage suggests the cool of the garden. 13 Ettinghausen, Sultans and Emperors, Pl. 7; Welch, LK, 1961, fig. 16; Grube, Classical Style, PI. 92. 284</page><page sequence="5">The universal theme calls for symbolic treatment, and La'l uses the flowing water in the channels as a metaphor for life. The symbolism is emphasized by the fact that the feet of Youth have been awkwardly displaced to the left in order to reveal behind him ayoung tree whose roots are not lodged in the earth, and which thus betokens impermanence. The inclusion of the commonplace foot-washer, and of a gardener in the left background, may be intended to show that the abstractions of Youth and Age derive their meaning from the everyday world. The subject was treated in a much less imaginative way in the Khamsah renovated for the Khafi-i Kh-n-n 'Abd al-Rahim in I026/I617.14 See No. 14; No. 23 also attributable. 6. 40 a, The chaste woman (Pl. 2) A beautiful woman, whom a king has noticed beyond his palace wall, is invited to the king's bed, but instead she plucks out her eyes and sends them to him. The action is seen at a distance over a garden. In a tower on the left the lady's eyes are being offered to the king on a dish, while she is seen recovering from their extraction in a pavilion on the right. The buildings are almost on a level, but hers is the more distant, being beyond the further wall of the garden. A town is seen in the central background. The masterly composition holds the action at a tactful distance, but gives visual form to the essential message of the story: that in spite of social inferiority the woman is the king's equal. The architectural scheme resembles that used by Madhu for a picture of a serenade in the Bahdristdn, but the neat clarity of the work also compares with that of Narsing's Bdrbad pays homage to Khusrau in the Nizmi Or. 12208, and the small figures and blue 'mop-head' palms are his.15 See Nos. 2 and 16. KHUSRAU U SHIRIN (Khusrau and Shirin) 7. P1 a, Shirin entertains Khusrau Shirin has met Khusrau by chance, and has taken him to the palace of Mahin B nfi (who, Niz mi tells us, is her aunt). Entertainments are held in his honour. During one such Khusrau declares his love for Shirin. Artist: Manohar A garden is seen over a foreground wall. In the centre Khusrau and Shirin sit in a pavilion, he on the left. Attendants are ready to serve them food.16 This page and Manohar's other contribution to the manuscript, The young man of Rum and the fay, are both romantic pavilion scenes with centralized compositions.

That Basawan had trained Manahar in pavilion scenes is evident from Bahram G-r in the Black Pavilion, on which both their names appear, in the Nizami of the Keir collection.8 If Basawan indeed directed Manahar to pavilion scenes it is not a matter of regret, since it is in the still and romantic scenes that his talent lies. Manahar has a sweet and rich sense of colour and a powerful feeling for the beauty and mystery of landscape and buildings. His figures are not strongly individualized, but have considerable power as romantic idealizations. Their straight-nosed faces often have the eyes downcast as though they were absorbed in the moment. They tend to be arrested in significant postures, a feature which was a liability in the would-be active scenes, but which in the Amir Khusrau pictures has the effect of suggesting an exquisite moment lifted beyond the flow of normal human activity. See No. 27. 8. 58 a, The ten youths and ten maidens One night when sitting with Shirin, Khusrau causes ten youths to declare their love for ten maidens. The following day their marriages are celebrated. Artist Sinwlah The scene is a courtyard; Khusrau and Shirin sit in a pavilion on the right, and the centre is occupied by dancing girls surrounded by musicians. Other retainers are present, but they are not readily identifiable as are the youths and maidens.19 The picture is not far removed from the competent but impersonal style of Sinwlah's work in the Akbarnamah of the Victoria and Albert Museum.20 One of Sinwlah's favourite yellow- flounced red awnings extends from the pavilion towards the left.

Farhad stands on the right, with some sheep. The milk channel runs downwards between the two groups, from an outcrop of rock behind Farhid to a square tank in the central foreground.21 The picture is richly coloured. Shirin is swathed in a golden shawl, and the landscape displays the colourful rock punctuated by dark trees which Sinwlah had used in Majnun visited by his mother in the British Library's Nizaimi.22 However, the figures opposed to each other on either side of the milk channel are ponderous and dull. See No. 8; Nos. 15, 18, 21 also attributable. io. 66 b, Death of Farhad (Pl.3) A hideous guard, sent by Khusrau, finds Farhid conversing with a shepherd and gives him the false and fatal news of the death of Shirin. In a combe amongst the rocks Farhid sits on the left clasping his knees; on the right kneels an elderly man, who is by no means hideous, but who holds a tasbih (rosary) and appears to be a stift. The shepherd kneels watching in the lower right.23 The hideous guard has been described at some length, and there is no mistaking the fact that the s.ft does not at all resemble him. This anomaly is the more interesting since it is also found in a manuscript of the Sultanate period, an Anthology containing both Khamsahs copied in 840/ 1436, probably in Bidar (Pl. 4).24 Farhid and the messenger are there both shown standing, and the messenger wears a high red kulah (cap) in his turban. The significance of this treatment of the messenger in the Indian subcontinent is not clear. The picture does not bear an attribution, but by comparison with Afla.tun (Fala~t.n/Plato) charms the animals in the Niz.mi Or. 12208 it may be ascribed to Madhu.25 The dominant colour of both pictures is a pale green whose coolness suggests a meditative quality turning to mystery in the Nizaimi, and to desolation in the Amir Khusrau. In each picture the sky is treated with broad sweeps of blue and white, the darkest area is a single tree, and a pale stream runs downwards in the foreground. A number of animals, cattle, deer and goats, have been included in the Death of Farhad; like the charmed animals in the Niza.mi picture they are drawn gracefully, with sympathy, but without the anthropomorphism often used by other artists. In the Niz.imi picture the animals form an image of death around the living Aflitun; in the Amir Khusrau the animals, engrossed in their own pursuits, form an image of life around the doomed Farhid. A further link is seen in the troubled expression of Aflattun and the messenger. The prosaic posture of Farhid who sits holding his knees in the dullness of despair reveals the universal nature of the painter's sympathy, and indeed the figure might be seen as a precursor to various genre studies of the seventeenth century. 21 Grube, Classical Style, Pl. 9I. i. 22 Titley, MPM, No. 323, Or. 12208, f. 15o b, no published illustration to my knowledge. 23 Grube, Classical Style, Pl. 91.2 24 E.

Artist: Farrukh A view over a foreground wall shows two courtyards. In the nearer Khusrau sits in a pavilion in the upper left, and in the further Shirin sits in a pavilion in the upper right. He is accompanied by numerous male attendants, and she by female. The architectural features are whitish in colour. The name Farrukh is found in a damaged state, with its central ra' missing. Farrukh, sometimes known as chelah (pupil) to distinguish him from Farrukh Beg, has recently been the subject of studies by both Krishna, who produced a preliminary corpus of his work, and Morris who has made some additions to this and analysed the style.26 The picture is closely related to Khusrau entertained by Mahin Banu in the Niz.mi Or. 12208, upon which Farrukh co-operated with Dhanraj.27 Both pictures show a strong diagonal emphasis, a rather leaden colour scheme, heavy moulding, and an elaboration of detail in architecture. It may be suggested that Farrukh's style resulted from a mixture of the mannered style of Farrukh Beg, and exposure to European prints. From the latter he would seem to have adopted superficial features such as distant vistas, proliferation of detail, and in some measure an absence of colour, but without understanding the rigour of the laws of perspective, composition, and the study of anatomy which informed them.

LAYLA U MAJNCJN (Layla and Majnun) 12. 94 b, The two divs (Pl. 5) Two divs (demons) who are tirelessly active are sent by Sulaymin (Solomon) to grind rock into sand and throw this into water to assist an irrigation project. Artist: CAliquli Standing in water, the two divs toil with wooden scoops in the foreground. The middle ground behind them is rocky. In the central background deer can be seen at a pool, benefiting from the raised water-table. This rather rare subject was also used in a dispersed Sultanate copy of Amir Khusrau's Khamsah datable to the late fifteenth century, where, however, an earlier phase of the action is shown with the divs building a palace.28 Closer to the Mughal picture is a folio from the dispersed Balkh manuscript of 9o9/15?4, which is now in the collection of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan.29 CAliquli was one of the less frequently used artists, but he attacks his subject with considerable humour. The divs are treated on a large scale which relates them to some illustrations of the 26 A.

CAliquli views the divs with much the same affable but detached humour as Miskinah and his colleagues accord to the workers engaged in building Agra in the Akbarnamah of the Victoria and Albert Museum.31 I3. 98 a, Laylad and Qays at school (Pl. 6) Layl- and Qays, children of different Arab tribes, are schooled together, and fall in love. Artist: Dharmdas (attribution pasted on) The courtyard of a mosque is seen from a high viewpoint. On a wide carpeted platform in the centre of the court the master sits in the upper right and Layla and Majn-n in the lower left. The majority of the other pupils are in the uncarpeted area surrounding the platform; they are engaged in study or horseplay. The attribution is confirmed by the similarity of the composition to that of Dharmdis's Death of Shirin in the Nizami, which is also set in an arcaded court.32 The central feature of the Niz-mi picture is the dramatic prostrate figure of Shirin on Khusrau's tomb; in the Amir Khusrau the inward drama of the onset of love in Qays and Layla has not satisfied the painter, and he has included an incident of bastinado among the schoolboys.

The painting technique approaches nim-qalam (half-colour).33 The composition appears to be related to that used in the Sultanate Anthology of 1436.34 Though the earlier picture is much simpler and has no pool, the figures are in an approximately similar relation to each other, and in both pictures there is a lion under a dark green tree on the left. The spacious landscape in thin colour, with its clearly outlined rocks and exquisite distant city, compares well with the background to Lal's Sultan Sanjar and the old woman in the 30 A.

See No. 5; No. 23 also attributable. 15. 13 a, Majnun and the dog Majn-n fondles a dog covered with sores because it has passed the place where Layl- lives. A courtyard is seen over a foreground wall, Majnun sits on the right holding a saluki. There are spectators on the left. In a pavilion in the upper right some elderly men are studying a book. The scene should be located in an arid place, Majnun's costume should be disordered, and the dog should be a pitiable object. Instead the picture is sumptuous, and it would seem that a richly dressed young prince is fondling his favourite hunting dog, perhaps during an interval in his studies. This love of magnificence suggests the work of Sinwlah, and the attribution is supported by the use of red and yellow drapery in the pavilion, and dark green trees outside the wall.

Artist: Narsing The couple sit facing each other on a flat rock in the middle of the composition. They are surrounded by animals, but Layla's camel is not shown. A stream runs vertically down from under the central rock. There is a city in the upper right. This is the most frequently used of all the Amir Khusrau subjects; it does not occur in Niz.mi's work, and thus the not infrequent instances among Mughal album pictures all stem from Khusrau's Khamsah. The composition is derived from manuscripts of Herat, where, however, the stream would run diagonally.36 The emotional and romantic subject does not appear to have been congenial to Narsing who shows the lovers apparently locked in a conversation of numbing boredom. The animals round about hardly relieve the state of stasis, save for the lion which seems to yawn. See No. 2; No. 6 also attributable. ` H.

That subject, however, occurs at a later point in the text. The present illustration is used at the point where the Khamsah of Nizarmi is summarized, and it may be that it is intended to epitomize that work. In Nizarmi's Khamsah Iskandar captures with his lasso two champions of RUis, the one, described as a div, who fought in chains, and the other, Qintal, who fought from an elephant; but neither event is mentioned in Armir Khusrau's summary. It is perhaps more probable that the picture is intended - in error - to convey the defeat of the Kh-q-n of Chin (China). In the Khamsah of Nizarmi Iskandar does not fight the Kh-q-n, but confusion may have arisen with a Shahnamah subject in which Rustam drags the Khiqan from his elephant with a lasso.37 Artist: Jaganat (attribution pasted on) The illustration shows a general melee, at the centre of which are two riders. The one on the left lassoes his opponent and drags him from his horse. The background is a rocky landscape with a distant city. The scene is characterized by rapid fluid movement. Though the figures are painted in solid colour, and rocks have a darkish outline, the background is in broad thin washes, and includes a city which is so thinly painted that it seems like the projection of a dream. The style corresponds to that of two illustrations bearing Jaganit's name in a copy of the Baburnamah which also contains the date 42/1597-8, and which is now in the National Museum, New Delhi, Acclama- tion of the standards, and Babur crossing the river.38 No. 26 also attributable. 18. 13 a, Kanifut revealed as a woman (Pl. xo) Iskandar has captured the most valiant champion of Chin: when stripped of armour, she is revealed as a woman. In a garden, seen over a foreground wall, Iskandar sits in a pavilion in the upper right with the courtiers standing about him. In the lower left Kaniffi is being stripped of her armour. The richness of colour, the large dignified figures, and the red and yellow awning proclaim the hand of Sanwlah; he is here at his best with a subject which permits a magisterial display of his type of classicism. A triangular composition balances the regal Iskandar, the unruffled Kaniffi, and the eager spectators. The burgeoning garden hints at the pleasures which await the principals at a more private moment. See Nos. 8, 9; Nos. 15, 21 also attributable. 37 The position of this illustration in the manuscript was kindly verified for me by Dr. E. Smart. 38 M. S.

Iskandar is enthroned on a dais with a sara-pardah (tent wall) about it. The men of Chin stand on the left. In the foreground are the gifts which Iskandar bestows upon the Khiqan. A golden crowrf is presented on a throne which is also of gold, and not the ivory specified by the text. Another gift is covered by a rich cloth. It seems probable the picture should be ascribed to Dharmdis on the basis of similarities to Shipur reports to Khusrau39 in the Nizami Or. 12208: in both cases the picture is provided with a round framed tent on the right, while a tree grows within the sard-pardah on the left. The men of Chin purport to wear the feather hats which are traditional in representations of Mongols; however, the feathers are here very sparse, and reveal beneath them soft black caps of European type. It seems probable that Dharmdis is celebrating Akbar's magnanimity to the various Europeans he had encountered. See Nos. 13, 20. 20. 13.228-31, Defeat of the pirates of Qubrus (Pl. 12) Iskandar has set up a televisual device to protect the seas. It facilitates the capture of pirates from Qubrus (Cyprus) who have been attacking merchantmen from Syria. Artist: Dharmdas (attribution pasted on) Over a rocky foreground is seen a complex naval encounter: on the right four skiffs; on the left three larger ships; behind the latter, three ships of Noah's ark type. These must respectively be the apprehending force, the pirates, and the merchantmen. There are two further ships in the background. In the upper right of the picture Iskandar's mirror is set upon a tower which resembles a minaret or lighthouse. In the mirror, the minute image of a ship can be recognized by its sail as the principal pirate vessel. The subject is unique. The attribution to Dharmdas seems to be correct, since the composi- tion with its high tower on the right corresponds to that of The man carried off by a bird in the Niza-rmi Or. 12208,40 and because the picture displays Dharmdis's liking for action.

In the foreground half of the picture the flood waters flow diagonally from the upper left bearing away people, buildings, and chattels. In the middle ground on the right a group of spectators watches in horror beside some rock. The background shows a group of buildings which may possibly represent a single mausoleum, spared from destruction, in which a group of philosophers had taken refuge. The subject is unique. It may possibly intend an allusion to the occasion when a dam burst at Fathpur Sikri, and, though dwellings were swept away, a group of courtiers was unscathed. The well-developed dignified faces, colourful rock and dark trees suggest a tentative attribu- tion to Sinwlah. See Nos. 8, 9; Nos. I5, 518 also attributable. 22. 13.228.30, Iskandar visits Faladtun The philosopher Fal-tun (Plato) who has escaped the flood, is unwilling to join Iskandar's court, so the king visits him at his cave. In the centre of the picture Fal-at n and Iskandar kneel in the mouth of the cave, Fal-tun on the left. To the left, behind Fal-tun, a squatting cook lifts the lid of a pot. To the right behind Iskandar there is a group of retainers; others, who resemble a hunting party, extend along the foreground, and Iskandar's horse is held in the lower right corner. The landscape is very rocky with a town in the upper right corner. As S. C. Welch has pointed out, this picture must be the work of Basawan.41 The kneeling figure of the sage is charged with numinous authority, and that of the king is a dignified but receptive listener. The interest in challenging form is seen again in the squatting figure of the cook. The spectator dog is also present, and seems more satisfied with the proceedings than in No. i. In this picture the principal action is framed in a central compartment, the sage's cave, which concentrates the attention in a similar way to the small enclosing room in The mullad rebukes the dervish of the Baharistan. The cave itself is masterly: where tradition would have suggested a black void, Basawan paints a receding space with brownish shadows merging in the gloom. The shading of the surrounding rocks is also beautifully modulated, its surface main- tained in a constant eddy of varying forms.

In the centre foreground Iskandar, in a jamjar-like container, is lowered into the sea from a sailing boat. Among the philosophers who accompany him, and the other spectators - who are not mentioned by the text -, two wear the soft black caps of Europeans, while to the left in the middle ground a boatload of Europeans appears to be listening to a preacher rather than watching Iskandar. In the background is the sea bordered by islands and then a pale distant landscape.42 The picture may be by LaCl. It has a long perspective, and its ships and Europeans agree well with Sultan Bahadur surrounded by the Portuguese in the British Library's Akbarnamah of 47/1603-43 See Nos. 5, 14. HASHT BIHISHT (Eight Paradises) 24. 13.228.28, Diladram charms the deer (Pl. 13) Not knowing that she is his dismissed favourite, Bahr-m Gur asks Dilaram to display the power of her harping to induce a deathlike sleep in wild animals. Under a tree on the left of the picture Dilaram kneels holding her harp. Bahr-m kneels on stony ground on the right. Dilaram's horse is in the bottom left corner, and Bahrim's behind him, cut by the right margin. To the left, between Dilaram and her horse, lie some animals which have already succumbed to the music; in the lower right other animals are listening attentively.44 Save for the fact that Bahr-m is there mounted, the composition is similar in its main lines to that used for this subject in an Anthology made in 810o/I407 in Yazd, in all probability for Iskandar, a grandson of Tim-r's, and hence a distant relation of Akbar's (Pl. 14).45 The manu- scripts which must have relayed this tradition are, however, lost. The Mughal picture appears to be by Miskinah, having his characteristic rock form, as in No. 4. See No. 25; No. 4 also attributable. 42 R. C.

I82 b, Bahram Gu-r welcomed to the Hasht Bihisht To distract Bahr-m Gir from hunting, a pleasure palace has been built contain- ing seven pavilions in which live princesses from seven regions of the world. The eighth paradise is the sum of the parts. Artist: Miskina and Farrukh, Miskinah In the centre of the picture, dressed in vermilion, Bahr-m sits before a large circular pavilion. Twelve ladies, six on either side, form a circle round him bowing. A water channel passes horizontally through the foreground. The two inscriptions show the Mughals themselves in doubt as to the proper spelling of Miskind/Miskinah. Morris has proposed that the central pavilion is Farrukh's contribution to this combined work,46 but though the execution of the structure with its tiers of spindly columns must be his, its firm central position must surely be due to Miskinah, whose Contending physicians in the Nizami Or. 1220847 are set, like Bahr-m here, against a central feature, in that case a draped red curtain. The secure centre to the composition, the even division of the ladies, and the line of the channel suggest that Miskinah laid out the composition doing everything in his power to counteract Farrukh's liking for the unstable diagonal. Miskinah probably dictated the fresh colour scheme, and it is possible that he arranged that the majority of the ladies should be shown in profile, to preclude the heavy shading Farrukh was wont to put on both sides of a nose. See, attributable to Miskinah, Nos. 4, 24. Work of Farrukh, No. II. 26. 188 a, Hasan's wife imprisoned in the tower Hasan, a wily goldsmith, escapes prison by a rope. His wife, on the other end of the rope, is drawn up into imprisonment. Hasan sees this as a a suitable punishment for her having betrayed a method for assaying the substandard gold in his figures. The tower, which resembles a minaret capped with a white domed chhatri (small pavilion), is set slightly to the left of the picture. H.asan and his wife hang suspended at either end of the rope; he on the left side of the tower and somewhat lower, and she on the right and near the top. The composition is closely similar to that used in the Khamsah renovated for CAbd al- Rahim.48 The dispersed Sultanate manuscript had illustrated a later phase when the imprisoned lady looks out of the tower at those who have discovered her. A separate drawing which might be 46Morris, p. 140, fig. 4. 47 Warner, vol. II, Pl. CXXII. 48 Sir T. W. Arnold and A. Grohmann, The Islamic Book, London and Leipzig, 1929, fig.

An attribution to Jagan-t may be suggested. Though the picture does not resemble No. 17, it is closely related to a painting in what appears to be an alternative style of his, The princess who painted a self-portrait in the Niza-mi Or. 12208.50 In these pictures both the wife and the princess wear a transparent jdmah (dress) over vermilion shalvadr (trousers); and in both the architecture is ornamented with neat bands of tilework, while the minaret of the Amir Khusrau picture matches a buttress in the Niz. mi in being topped by a chhatri. This style is also found in the New Delhi Baburndmah in Jagan-t's Bibur seated in the house ofJaldl al-din at Karrah.1 See No. 17. 27. 13.228.33, The young man of R-m and the fay (Pl. 15) A young Byzantine has entered an enchanted garden. At night a fay appears and, sensing his presence, invites him to sit with her. Artist: Manohar Under a night sky the couple sit in a pavilion in the centre of an enclosed garden, he on the right. The fairy has a feathered body and wings, and holds a book. Other feathered fairies make music or stand in attendance.52 The romantic atmosphere found in Shirtn entertains Khusrau is here intensified by the night and the exotic nature of the fairies. In the Persian tradition fairies were clothed in garments distantly derived from Buddhist art, and by the I59os European paintings had provided the Mughal artists with models for mythological figures in a further range of costumes. The feathered fairy, however, seems to combine two other traditions: the Persian tradition which showed various strange folk in leaf skirts, and the Sultanate tradition, as found in the fifteenth century Distin-i Amir Hamzah (H.amzahndmah) (Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Or. fol. 4181) which shows fairies with feathered wings, but wearing a tight fitting fabric 'bodysuit'.53 See No. 7. 28. 203 b, The div at the temple (Pl. 16) Ram, a prince in exile, has been directed to a temple in Egypt where, by a process of wax casting and contemplation, the likeness of a demonic statue becomes his servant.

To the left of the foreground the div waits outside the gate. The tower and the gate have inset panels in black stone with figures suggestive of Hindu sculpture. The subject is unique. The artist's name appearing below the picture is damaged, but in it mim is closely followed by kdf, and in consequence it may be read as Mukund. Mukund may have been considered a specialist in the representation of sculpture. In the Niza-m Or. 12208 his Iskandar sets up the statue of the veiled bride shows the figure as in black stone; and his lefthand side of The priestess beseeches Iskandar to spare the idol, shows the idol in gold.54 Two other pictures in the Niami, Faridun and the gazelle and Bahram Gur takes the crown have, in a rocky outcrop and in a central tree, a strong vertical axis which corresponds to the temple tower in the Amir Khusrau picture.55 Mukund's figures have heart-shaped faces, which may be held upwards, and shoulders which are held somewhat forward to facilitate rather emphatic gestures. No. 3 also attributable. 29. 208 b, The lady of the stable tower pretends to faint A king who is doubtful of women's fidelity has established four ladies in four towers of his palace, those of the stable, camel-stable, garden and wine-store. He possesses a magical statue which laughs to signal the presence of falsehood. When the king strikes the lady of the stable tower with a rose, she seems to faint, but the statue is activated. Artist: Sur Dis Gujar-ti The four towers are shown in the corners of the picture; they surround a courtyard. In the centre of the courtyard the king sits in a pavilion with the lady. She is semi-recumbent with her head to the left. The statue stands above her head. The subject is unique. The picture has been published by Ettinghausen.56 In a masterly way the composition refers to the quadripartite structure of the story while focusing the attention upon a particular event in the centre. The statue's position just above the lady's head indicates its authority. The statue's grinning face and its curling toes demonstrate a malicious glee in the revelation which it is making. A rather similar sentiment is found in Sur Das Gujarati's contribution to the Niz-mi Or. 12208, the picture of Mani painting a dead dog on a rock as a warning to people who had previously been duped by the water which he had painted there. The Ni.zami picture not only displays Stir D-s's humour, but, in showing Mani's painting equipment, it reveals his interest in work as subject matter. This can also be seen in the characteristic activities of the towers in the Amir Khusrau picture; and it is evident in Stir Dis's illustration of the almond trade in the New Delhi Bdburndmah.57 Stir Dis was evidently deeply concerned with the technical aspects of his own art, and his gradations of colour are very fine. 54 The statue, Titley, MPM, No. 323, Or. 12208, f. 266 b, no published illustration to my knowledge; the idol, G.

On the back cover, a sun in the upper left corner shines on a battle of feathered fairies and divs which takes place against a rocky mountainside; in the middle ground a spiralling flight of steps issues from the rock, and loops to the right round a pair of fairy lovers sheltered by a screen, while in the centre of this sector a bull, ridden by a fairy, drinks at a small tank; in the foreground more fairies disport themselves at a larger tank." The scene of the front cover touches on the theme 'visit of a courtier to a sage.' This seems to have been considered the epitome of Amir Khusrau's work, reflecting his own life as a courtier and disciple."9 The story which is usually illustrated by the composition at the top of the front cover occurs in Matla' al-Anvar, and though that is not illustrated in this copy, the theme is echoed in Iskandar visits Faladtun, which is found here. The subject of the back cover is more puzzling. It might be seen as a battle between good and evil, or perhaps between the civilized and the brutish. It recalls the world of Midsummer Night's Dream (as it happens, a closely contemporary work), but it also invites Freudian interpretations. The concealing effect of the lacquer makes it difficult to be sure which artist made the covers, but it may be suggested that he was Basawan. The sage of the front cover resembles his Falatun, and the tiger hunt recalls a celebrated composition of his in the Akbarnamah of the Victoria and Albert Museum.60 The back cover, with its combat and tank is to an extent comparable with another composition designed by Basawan in the Akbarnamah, the Battle between rival groups of sannyast at Thanesar, in which also the mounted Akbar resembles the mounted figure of the front cover of the Amir Khusrau.61 It may also be recalled that it is Manohar, the son of Basawan, who treats the theme of feathered fairies within the manuscript. It seems almost certain that Basawan would have directed the production of the Khamsah. He is the most renowned of the artists involved, he painted the first illustration, and he may be credited with the cover and the thematically important Iskandar visits Faldtfin. From this point it may be permissible to enter a more speculative area. A picture by Basawan in the collection of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan has been published as The flight of the simurgh.62 It shows a man clinging to the foot of a monstrous bird whose beak is also full of men; the man is being carried over a jungle landscape which has a mountain on the left, a small building of Hindu character on the right, and sea in the foreground. The subject may be identified as one of the further adventures of the youth of Rfim (of No. 27) who is carried away from the dwelling of a hermit by a man-eating bird (murgh-i mardum-khvar). The subject is cognate with the Man carried away by a bird in the Nizimi Or. 12208, where however the raptor is not man-eating. The identifica- tion of the subject is supported by the fact that in the Khamsah of Amir Khusrau renovated for CAbd al-Rahim in 1617 there is an illustration at this point in the text, but there the artist bases 58 R.

It might be that a large copy of Amir Khusrau's Khamsah was contemplated and then abandoned, or it might be that the large picture was in some sense a preliminary exercise for the Waiters copy. It may even be suggested that the picture could represent a competitive entry for the direction of that manus- cript. Another picture in the Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan collection is also on a large scale, being 345x228mm (page 396x 3 3 mm); though unsigned, it has been attributed to the distinguished Persian painter CAbd al-Samad, and published as Theprince and the hermit.64 The subject is of the 'visit to a sage' type; it does not necessarily refer to Khusrau's Khamsah, and indeed for the detail of its composition it draws on a Niz.mi illustration, Iskandar's visit to the sage from the Herat copy of 900oo/1493-94 (British Library, Or. 68Io).65 It is, however, possible that this picture represents cAbd al-Samad's bid to direct the Amir Khusrau manuscript. Why no work by CAbd al-Samad appears in the Waiters manuscript is not known. It may be he had died before it was made, or it may be that Basawan was preferred; in the latter event, the presence in the manuscript of two versions of the 'visit to the sage' attributable to Basawan would have an extra point to it. This survey of the illustrations to Akbar's Khamsah of Amir Khurau has chiefly stayed within the bounds of the identification of subjects, and the setting of pictures within the context of the styles of individual artists. It has strayed into the history of the compositions only to point to two striking connections to pictures of the Sultanate period, and one to an early Timuirid picture. The interesting question of why the particular subjects were chosen for illustration has not been addressed here. 63 Arnold and Grohmann, Islamic Book, fig. 87; Beach, Imperial Image, fig. 26. 64 Welch and Welch, AIB, No. 5 5. 65 I.
