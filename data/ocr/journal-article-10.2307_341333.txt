<plain_text><page sequence="1">FAUNA IN THE NOVELS OF JUAN GOYTISOLO KESSEL SCHWARTZ University of Miami REAL and imagined resemblances and relationships between animals and human beings have preoccupied writers from earliest times, and they have utilized animal imagery constantly throughout literature for derogatory, satirical, or sympathetic purposes. In contemporary Hispanic literature Ram6n Sender, Juan Jose Arreola, and Julio Cortizar, among others, have concentrated on the theme; but none has so consistently used animals iconoclastically as Juan Goytisolo. Goytisolo no doubt believes that Spanish society is a menagerie, a kind of backward jungle, inhabited by herds of sheep easily victimized by dictatorship, capitalism, tourism, the Catholic Church, and sexual frustrations. Spaniards suffer all of the savage aspects of animalistic living without any of the positive benefits to be derived from a more primitive and forceful life containing sexual and sadistic elements which help one to cope with a cruel and violent world. If the atmosphere of Spain is bestial, it is only natural that animals reside there. As the author ridicules the pretensions to cultural dignity and intellec- tuality of Spanish society, he uses animal characterizations, using beasts to show us the absurdity of human life, and indicating a variety of zoomorphic and emotional relationships which involve aggression, death, danger, sex, hunger, politics, and religion. Animal imagery, anthropomorphism, and zoomorphism exist from his first through his latest novels, with a continuing intensification, starting with Sehlas de iden- tidad, of cultural, psychological, and sexual connections. At times he attributes animal characteristics or qualities to humans. At others he ascribes human moti- vations to non-human beings. Addition- ally, he uses imagery involving bats, dogs, cats, goats, monkeys, tigers, rabbits, lizards, fish, snails, frogs and, in reality, an entire galaxy of animals from apes to vul- tures.' In over a hundred instances Goyti- solo employs animal imagery as a stylistic device without any species designation. Human beings and animals often lead mutually dependent lives, and pets reward the affection of their masters (JM, p. 67). Although he at times refers to "astucia animal,"' or "me arafi6 como una fiera" (F., p. 125), for the most part Goytisolo, through his human-animal comparisons views the latter as a victim of humanity's worst inhuman instincts: "Jadeaba como un animal perseguido" (JM, p. 207); "como un animal acorrolado" (DP, p. 104); "timorato e incierto . . . animal domestico" (SI, p. 75).3 When Alvaro suffers his heart attack, the crowd ignores his pain, and he is "el animal indefenso que jadeaba a sus pies, acechando la llegada de la ambulancia .. ." (SI, p. 59). In general Goytisolo places humans far down the zoo- logical scale, even below parasites.4 Before treating the seven types of animals used most persistently by Goyti- solo, let us examine some of his general themes. Given his interest in the self- destructive politics of his country, his attacks on the imposed and accepted intellectual conformity, and his search, not only for his own marks of identity but the signs and meanings of Spanish society, it is not surprising that he uses animals to por- tray the immobility of the Spanish political superstructure and its denial of human life and dignity.' Goytisolo describes the ani- malization of a society through the meta- morphic roles of his characters. Alvaro, for example, alone and feeling almost invisi- ble, associates the croaking of frogs, the noise of crickets, to past events, recalling Spain as a cradle of heroes, saints, mad- men, and inquisitors, "toda la extrafia fauna ibera . . ." (SI, pp. 164-65). Goyti- solo uses this concept of a general herd to criticize the status quo, seeing the defend- ers of reason taking animal advantage over fellow countrymen, herds of oxen eating the fodder provided them, "triste rebafo de bueyes ... pasta de aprovechados," and composes his documentary "sobre la grey espafiola expulsada de su tierra por la opre- sion . . . el hambre la injusticia" (SI, pp. 104, 237, 355).6 When Alvaro attends Prof. Ayuso's funeral, he compares the new Bar- celona society to "fauna espafola" and proposes that traditional shacks might dis- appear without the new capitalism, which brings more than its share of new problems. 540</page><page sequence="2">Fauna in the Novels of Juan Goytisolo 541 Goytisolo, utilizing a variety of animal connotations to convey important charac- teristics, evokes Spain as "la habitaci6n natural de la fauna espafiola . . . grey sil- vestre," condemned to disappear with animal-like resignation before the tourists' onslaught (SI, p. 64). Aside from the "happening" involving the American tour- ist, "Hija de la Revoluci6n Americana" (CJ, pp. 65-68), the narrator describes a tourist excursion bus, huge as a whale and having a snout like a shark (CJ, p. 46). Elsewhere, hordes of tourists take shelter, "cobijados bajo el ala de clueca de un ofi- cioso" (JT, pp. 103-04).' The tourists con- clude that European districts are much cleaner, for in Spain abstract mongrels search for food amidst clouds of flies, "negras, velludas, pringosas" (CJ, p. 45). Contrasts with other countries involve a continuing denigrating description of the misery and poverty in Spain, "perro esque- 16tico . . . basuras . . . oleadas de moscas tornasoladas y perezosas ... entre aquellos despojos ... corrupci6n del aire .. ." (DP, pp. 52-53). These comparisons, then, reflect an indolent and degraded State where animals prowl garbage-laden heaps, part of the environment in which Spaniards live. Political comparisons inevitably lead to cultural ones. Alvaro associates Venice with birds (SI, pp. 362-63), Amsterdam with butterflies (SI, p. 346), and Cuba with animals wandering through the fields (SI, pp. 425-27). This evocation of foreign climes allows him more objectively to visualize his own culture, which he sees as a superficial adoption of foreign models which in no way alter hidebound Spanish traditions. The only solution involves their complete cultural destruction, visualized by the narrator of Reivindicaci6n del Conde don Julidn and Juan sin Tierra. The Moors, transformed into frightening submarine fauna, will take over (CJ, p. 84), a process which intensifies in halluci- natory evocation and drug stupors, as the author, through animal symbols, replaces Spanish with Arabic culture. In Nubian territory, abandoning the promiscuous herd, riveted on "los gestos felinos de tu mentor," he falls "entre las fauces abiertas del cavernoso mastin," before once more imagining himself "entre tu antigua fauna," now incarnated as Alvaro Krupp but acknowledging that "el subsuelo afri- cano te basta . . ." (JT, pp. 131-33). Thanks to his special use of pronouns, the narrator manages to travel the Moslem world. In analyzing his language, Vosk complains that the narrator is trying to sell him a cat for a hare and receives as a response to "iqu6 mosca le ha picado?," the reply that it might be a common house- fly or a tsetse fly (JT, p. 303). Dissatisfied, the narrator will in the future use another language (Arabic), his gift curling back on itself like the tail of a scorpion. And so he transforms himself like a larva into an insect and, like a frog, mocking and mocked, puts down on the white paper sheets bits and pieces of his former person- ality (pp. 318-19). The narrator abandons all of his traditional literary symbols. One of the Vosk incarnations enchants the birds and the beasts, but is surprised to find the beautiful literary heroine in a deserted place, populated, "por lo comfin de alima- has y otras temibles fieras . . ." (JT, pp. 268-69). After a mocking rejection of the shibboleths of literary tradition and an exploration of writing, which he likens to a bird hunting for prey (JT, p. 298), the narrator realizes that he will never have his statue in a public square, that birds will not alight on it nor dogs stain its pedestal; in this way he will avoid an obscene symbiosis with the land he hates (JT, p. 317). Part of Goytisolo's reservations about Spanish culture and tradition involves his continuing and long-standing aggression toward the Catholic Church. These at- tacks, related to animals, occur in several novels. In satirical auto da fe scenes, some victims go to their deaths on a donkey, and the president of the Society for the Preven- tion of Cruelty to Animals fails to take into account the cathartic nature of the cere- mony which will protect humans from acting like "los mas brutos animales" (JT, pp. 195-96). In a savage attack on the Virgin Mary and a parody of the birth of the Christ child, Goytisolo has a "perro esquel6tico" sniff at him and associates his homage with "pie de culebra, pelos de macho cabrio . . ." (CJ, p. 237). In Juan sin Tierra the attack, if possible, is even more ferocious. The dove in mythology symbolizes love; in Matthew 10, innocence. But, according to an old Christian legend it also represents the word of the angel</page><page sequence="3">542 Kessel Schwartz Hispania 64 (December 1981) which, as the breath of a dove, entered Mary's ear, obviously with phallic power.8 In Goytisolo's novel the bird pecks the canary seed, and excites Yemaya, capti- vating her. When Chang6 appears on a Moorish horse, his moustache like a lizard's tail, he kills and devours the bird but also metamorphoses as the Dove. Yemaya, eager to face his masculine organ, pictures it as a wild beast, "hosco y dafiino animal" which she is eager to liberate from between his legs (JT, pp. 56-57). Goytisolo's concern for the Spanish religious strait jacket leads him to the con- comitant topic of sexuality. Goytisolo's protagonists struggle for ego identity, and his heroes suffer from a variety of neurotic manifestations and fantasies involving cas- tration, a return to mother, other womb fantasies, fetishism, sadism, and maso- chism as they encounter bizarre situations and incidents.9 Sibling rivalries, incest, impotence, bestialism, homosexuality, masturbation, and various neurotic and hallucinatory sexual states and parent-child relationships comprise some of the carnal, sensual, animal symbolism. As usual Goy- tisolo employs animals specifically and generally. Peranzules's daughter displays her thighs which "la hispanica grey" holds in awe (CJ, p. 164). Men take their sexual pleasures "gozando como brutos ani- males," and convicts are allowed their "pecado bestial" (JT, pp. 29, 201). Parodying the white man's view of blacks' sexual activities, Goytisolo proclaims that "ni las fieras ni animales del monte son tan desenfrenados" (JT, p. 38).'o As the narra- tor views the primal scene he dreams of the charge of wild beasts who will destroy his parents (JT, p. 156). A child will condense into one image the primal scene and his own union with his mother. A situation causing separation means anxiety and aggression. When he sees his parents in bed together, the child wants to separate them and punish his mother's infidelity repre- sented by the primal scene." Animals, many times, reflect human emotional states involving love, fear, hate, and especially aggression, which quite often leads to death, a mortality portrayed through the zoological connection. In Jue- gos de manos Agustin kills David whose motionless feet "imitaban la aleta de un gran pez" (JM, p. 244). Goytisolo here employs a symbolic symmetry, for earlier in the novel David recalls how in his child- hood he saved, with the help of other children, some fish which were suffocating; how don Angel caused him to drop some, but how happy he felt with "la visi6n de los peces, ebrios de vida" (JM, p. 178). In Duelo en el Paraiso, Abel, about to die in the forest, "oscura como un presagio de muerte," listens to the frightened birds and croaking of crows, and E16segui relates the song of the birds before Abel's death to their silence after it (DP, p. 16). In Serlas de identidad Alvaro matches animals with natural death sequences, for example, in the cemetery where a hoopee symbolically skims the tops of the tombs.'2 In his reflections on humanity and its social, cultural, religious, and sexual con- structs, Goytisolo prefers certain animal organisms in order to reflect negative bestial, sensual, or physical attributes but also to demonstrate the superiority of animality over humanity. These include serpents, birds, insects, cats, bulls, apes, and dogs. The serpent, of course, has been traditionally hated and feared, and Goyti- solo refers to its connection with Christi- anity and its victims. Venemous serpents will accompany Alvaro's flirtation with Hell (JT, p. 292), and the serpent will tempt him despite the protestations of Alvaro's guardian angel about his incipient defecation. When Alvaro eliminates with- out sound or fury, the serpent flees. Viewed in its aggressive poisonous, mytho- logical attributes, the serpent throughout will adopt a threatening posture. The Arabs, and not the Spaniards, can use it, exercising their power with "enigmaitica violencia . . . la sierpe fambrienta se aper- cibe al ataque" (CJ, pp. 135-36, 144). The tiger-eyed Julian will sodomize Alvarito with his serpent, strangle him, and inject its poison, "el liquido mortifero". Addition- ally, the "cuerpo rigido" of a lifeless cat, hanging by its neck from one of the trees, will accompany that death (CJ, pp. 209- 18). The serpent also kills Mrs. Putifar in a "happening" and on birth destroys the inside of his mother (CJ, p. 126). Yet, reptiles are superior entities. In Manhattan sewers crocodiles, lizards and iguanas will produce a new amphibious species, the envy of men who would be like them, large, flexible, and with a talent for swimming.</page><page sequence="4">Fauna in the Novels of Juan Goytisolo 543 As man descends the animal scale, he will, paradoxically, ascend, exalting "los encan- tadores de serpientes," disputing propa- ganda about serpents' poisonous fangs and exploring the hiding places of the crafty reptile with hopes of domesticating it (JT, pp. 79-81). Goytisolo uses serpent imagery in many ways: "la carretera zigzaguea como una vibora .. ." (JT, p. 115), but concentrates on their sexual and phallic power.'3 Anxious females await an attack: "el pasivo serrallo acogera con juibilo la robusta culebra"; "mujeres de toda laya ? . . rehusando el lechuguino concepto, invocan en suefios la arabiga sierpe" (CJ, pp. 127, 149). Count Julian violates the grotto of Spanish purity but traps himself, his serpent becoming a stone blade. Goyti- solo depicts the reptile ecstasy of Arab asps as the damsels surrender to Tariq's men "con docilidad bestial, a sus cobras tenaces e imperiosas culebras" (CJ, p. 172). His description includes mention of the Medu- sa, whose head horrified and turned men to stone, a symbolic rigidity easily equated with phallic prowess.14 Alvarito, fascinated by Julian's asp, evokes in his mind all kinds of sexual activity and dangerous beasts, matching his excitement to Julian's snake's arousal. He succumbs to the "cobra barr6- camente erguida . . triunfal . . . abraza, estrangula, asfixia . . ." Unwilling and resisting at first, the boy later submits to the sodomy, enslaved by and kneeling to the serpent to "implorar el perd6n" (CJ, pp. 219-25). The serpent also involves the mother figure, pictured as good, kind, and protective. Julian orders Alvarito to bring her to be victimized by the snake, "tu madre y la culebra, la culebra y tu madre. . ." And through sodomy and suicide, "serpiente troglodita . . . en simbiosis ful- minea . . . tui mismo al fin, (inico, en el fondo de tu animalidad herida . . ." (CJ, pp. 228-30), Julian and Alvarito become one; Julidn, thus, liberates himself through the sexual instinct represented by the snake. In a sense this incident may be equated with a symbolic dragon fight in mythological terms, for the hero's fate por- trays that of the ego and the danger of being swallowed by the maternal uncon- sciousness. A successful dragon fight results in the marriage of the hero and the female captive in order to found a new kingdom. When this fails to occur it implies a strong unconscious tie to the Great Mother.'5 In Juan sin Tierra the narrator relates the power he feels to "serpentina presencia que subyuga y que castra . . ." (p. 125). He comments on the clandestine cult toward lascivious reptiles, as a shameless convict admits his "execrable devoci6n a la sierpe" (p. 205). Receiving fraternal care, insuring their reproduction, they may infiltrate the conjugal bed itself (p. 249). The serpent also fuses with the snake charmer, Julian, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood, in almost identically repro- duced versions of the same event at differ- ent stages of Reivindicaci6n del Conde don Julidn, although the author alters the apparent superimposed sameness through countless subtle variations. The narrator states, "erase una vez un precioso niflo," complete with fetishes, snake, wolf, and blood (p. 13). Alvarito takes the role of Caperucito, and JuliAn, disguised as grand- mother, will receive him. The author asso- ciates the fairy tale with illicit sexual rela- tions of neighbors, their mongoloid child, and the violation of Alvarito by the flower seller. Interspersed with the plot line, "... soy Caperucita Roja y traigo unas tortas . .," we find the gossip of the flower seller and her lover (pp. 94-98). Alvarito Peran- zules, transformed into Little Red Riding Hood, will carry the goodies to Granny, will get into bed with her, and, discovering that she is a sharp-clawed Moor, will exclaim: "qu6 bicho tan grande tienes" (pp. 209-10). Alvarito "busca y acata la serpiente" (pp. 224-25), implying that he wants the wolf to follow to grandmother's house, to have Julian wound (sodomize) him with the serpent.'6 Interestingly enough, in view of the iden- tification of Julian with Alvarito, G6za Roheim postulates that the wolf, grand- mother, and Little Red Riding Hood are the same person. She is swallowed into her own "sleep-womb," the same as the inside of her mother. The hunter is the father figure; his knife, the penis. Julidn then represents the father, but Roheim states that the infant desires and is the original aggressor; aggression and regression com- bine as the cannibal child creates a cannibal mother."'7 Julian tells himself to flee from his people in order to be safe in his adopted</page><page sequence="5">544 Kessel Schwartz Hispania 64 (December 1981) African land. Clearly he connects his own people with parents and Alvarito, as we have seen, for "vibora, reptilia o serpiente enconada que al nacer, rompe los yjares de la madre: tu vientre liso ignora la infamia del ombligo . . . el nifio vuelve del colegio con la cartera a la espalda ... el nifio fasci- nado por el aspid y ti', Julian, avanzando . ." (p. 126). Grandmother may also be mother, and the story explains an oedipal situation. The wolf, both good and bad, gives and takes, since the sexual object is both desired and feared.'8 Of course, if mother and grandmother are one, a child would not want to harm her, but if a wolf killed her (Juliin's alter-ego Tariq is called, el lobo), the child could hate and fear the wolf without feeling responsibility. None- theless, the child is involved because he can consummate his sexual desires only by proxy, in a symbolic rape.'9 Avian imagery may convey both pleasant and unpleasant situations as the author refers to bird-like motions and mannerisms of a number of his characters. David's great aunt, Lucia, "corria de un lado a otro como un pajarillo" (JM, p. 180), and the woman searching for her father sticks her head out "como la de un p.jaro reci6n arrancada de su nido" (SI, p. 392).20 One characteristic of Goytisolo's description of birds involves their comparison with ma- terial objects; birds flying overhead are "como flechas" (JM, p. 124); banana trees are forsaken black-winged birds (F, p. 156). He uses them also to reproduce politi- cal situations. In Serhas de identidad Alva- ro's aunts "como loros" reject newspaper accounts of the Spanish situation as lies (SI, p. 320); in Reivindicaci6n del Conde don Julidn the hombre carpeto is "la galli- na" (CJ, p. 115) and the Falangist fighters who ended the possibility of a Spanish rebirth are "aguerridos y escandalosos gallos de marzo" (CJ, pp. 124, 137). Birds play an important sexual role in Goytisolo's novels. Antonio's introduction to sex takes place in the presence of birds.2' The bird, of course, has always been a phal- lic symbol, and in the popular speech of many languages is a synonym for the mas- culine organ. In La isla Claudia's sister-in- law shows her a canary in a cage, hungrily examined by a cat which flees upon her approach, much as her own appearance incapacitates Enrique. When Rafael at- tempts to make love to her she resists and, on going down stairs, finds the canary cage on its side and the bird gone. Her own feel- ings of frustration and alienation are thus reinforced. Meanwhile, the children watch the cage in hope of punishing the cat.22 Quite often sexual and religious connota- tions occur together. Lourdes, recounting tales of martyrdom, links the virginal spirit of one martyr to the dove: "se vio salir de su boca una paloma blanca" (SI, p. 22). In Juan sin Tierra the savage attacks include a sexually aroused fat girl who waits for a visit from the Dove or Holy Spirit. Blessed fruit of the womb, the girl on the record jacket performs delicate needlework pictur- ing a gentle ox, a donkey, and a little lamb while she scrutinizes the sky, waiting for "el raudo y ligero visitador" (p. 54). Chang6's violation of his mother and con- comitant destruction of the Dove, a con- tinuation of the parody, intensifies the sexual elements involved. He himself becomes the Dove and, as the Christ child, his own father. Human beings identify their own emo- tional states with the presence of birds. Antonia's parrot in Fiestas imitates the lady upstairs while its mistress holds the bird to her breast, petting and kissing it. When Pipo awakens to a new day to the sound of birds, he realizes that butterflies had once been caterpillars, linking their change with his own coming of age and the release by the authorities of thousands of pigeons with his own emotional maturity (F., pp. 218-19). Pablo and his friend Atila react to the ferocity of the cockfight, the former with aversion, the latter with identi- fication: "participaba en el combate con los cinco sentidos. . . . Estaba excitado todavia por la tensi6n de la rifia" (EC, pp. 35-37). The fugitives, carrying birds, open the cage door to set the doves free, connect- ing their own plight with that of the birds (DP, p. 11). Alvaro's recall blends with the noise of crickets and a bird moving out to sea. As he talks to Dolores, a blackbird alights on the eaves. When he awakens "los p.jaros gorjean en las ramas... las golon- drinas son infinitamente sutiles." He asso- ciates his new tranquility with "el vuelo irreal de las aves"; his relationship with Dolores and self-discovery with cats and birds: "los gatos negros y las palomas blan- cas . . . os devolvia poco, a ti y a ella, a</page><page sequence="6">Fauna in the Novels of Juan Goytisolo 545 vuestra remota extraviada identidad."' Once more in the present, he holds Dolores's hand, the silence composed of an infinity of tiny sounds, the croaking of frogs, the hum of the crickets and "el vuelo conciso, cehido, de los pijaros" (SI, pp. 348-49, 399, 465, 476, 332, 398). Paris for Alvaro also means a battle between an old man feeding pigeons and a woman who tries to chase them away, symbolic of his own inner turmoil between artistry and action (SI, pp. 379-81). At times the instinctive forces found in children, adults, and animals reveal them- selves through aggressive acts, the killing of a cat, or a rooster, with which Julian iden- tifies, like him pursued and related to the rabies-carrying dog as a destructive force.23 A casual examination reveals a persistent, sadistic, and aggressive animal symbolism related to human activity in all of Goyti- solo's novels. Luis and Gloria "ponian trampas a los pajaros y cemento en la boca de los hormigueros" (JM, p. 68); more than cruelty, their action symbolizes their general rebellion against society's rules. The children in Duelo en el Paraiso exercise the power to torment smaller children and animals, not only to compensate for their own feelings of impotence in the face of superior adult strength but also as a reflec- tion of the savage environment and reality. The little ones learn to kill birds with "car- gas de dinamita" (p. 20), and bands of boys knock down their nests "a pedradas" (p. 224). Abel also shatters the birds' eggs, forgetting the love Estanislaa had taught him to feel for birds (DP, pp. 20, 224, 240- 41, 116-17, 233, 229-30). As noted previ- ously, birds also symbolize human death. El6segui hears of Dora's death to the accompaniment of a "chillido siniestro y lejano de un ave" (DP, p. 58), and Alvaro, as he views nature, sees "auras tifiosas ... sobre el esqueleto de los autom6viles. ... Un aroma de muerte y putrefacci6n impregna agudamente el paisaje" (SI, pp. 441, 465). Cats also play a large role in Goytisolo's menagerie. One of the characters in La resaca is Hombre-Gato; in other novels characters have "ojos brillantes de felino" (DP, p. 123), "mirada felina" (JT, p. 108), or "felinos ojos" (CJ, p. 89). Mendiola recalls a variety of black cats, one belong- ing to Professor Ayuso, another belonging to Madame de Heredia, and still another in Madame Berger's French cafe (SI, pp. 81, 332, 335-36). In Juan sin Tierra the narra- tor passes a symposium of starving cats performing their concert of mournful meows under the toscaninian baton of a splendid tiger-striped specimen, "inso- lente, mat6n, con superiores aires de chulo" (p. 114). As with other animal sym- bols, Goytisolo uses cats to demonstrate human aggression. In Duelo en el Paraiso Pablo and Abel dream of the bullets with which they will pierce Lucia's cat (pp. 240- 41), throw rocks at it (pp. 116-17), and drop a paving stone on another one, which makes Abel feel, "por vez primera la ilu- si6n de ser hombre" (p. 233). In Sefias de identidad children also stone a cat, and in Reivindicaci6n del Conde don Julidn they pursue a cat, "pel6n y tifioso," kill and bury it (pp. 51-52, 239). Cats have almost always served as an erotic symbol; quite often they may repre- sent the "evil mother." An unconscious dislike for women and a fear of aggressive erotic components, may, nonetheless, cause one to think of the cat as male rather than female. In any event, antipathy toward cats is always symbolic.24 Abel insists on knowing the precise relationship in the birth process between cats and people. The answer that one comes into the world to seek purity angers him, and the relationships of cats and birth, seen as unpleasant, triggers a train of associations concerning his stillborn brother and jeal- ousy at the intimacy that the unborn child had with his mother (DP, p. 112). Cora, for the sexually aroused soldier is "mi gatita" (LR, p. 125), and Laura, removing her clothes, rubs against Roman like a cat (I, p. 112). The cat pursued by the boys who beat its dead body, in spite of its diffi- cult life, had lived nights of love and erotic meowing (CJ, pp. 18, 239).25 The ape and monkeys play an important role in some of Goytisolo's novels. One of the chief characters in Fiestas is the huge muscled Gorila; in Selas de identidad one of the supposed spies is also named Gorila. Spain, for Alvaro in Seias de identidad, means a monkey on a platform, angry at the nois'e and the crowds which drive him wild (SI, p. 370). Aside from extended use of imagery, Goytisolo uses the gorila desig- nation either seriously to convey similari-</page><page sequence="7">546 Kessel Schwartz Hispania 64 (December 1981) ties or as a continuing source of burlesque and parody. Thus in Juegos de manos the term gorila epitomizes women both pejora- tively and positively.26 The ape, also, has given rise to sexual myths, and, a virtual caricature of man, has represented man's evil impulses.27 Goytisolo fuses the erotic with religious impulses. In Juan sin Tierra, after Chang6 possesses his mother, he con- verts to King Kong, the totemic animal of the narrator. His apparition creates frus- tration for moaning damsels who admire, in vain, his tremendous artefact, a symbol of amorous potency denied humans. The characters undergo a variety of changes to "orangutan victorioso" and then to a gorilla, "onirica metamorfosis" (JT, pp. 76, 159). The zoo, in reality a whorehouse inhabited by four-handed hominids, gives Kong, newly reincarnated as Chang6, the chance to possess the backsides of Queen Kong, the Visitada and principal whore of Istanbul. .... The excommunicators try to excommunicate all ophidians, but they fly to Africa in search of an avenging King Kong. In a desert filled with wild beasts, "prado lleno de serpientes, ora pro nobis . .. verdadera Queen Kong," the narrator realizes that the thought of Hell should terrorize him, as he peruses an old manual of piety (pp. 290-92). Goytisolo's implica- tion that the Church is a whorehouse and that the metamorphosed Queen-Kong, a whore, is the Virgin Mary, carries his attack to its ultimate possibilities. As Linda Gould Levine has shown, Goy- tisolo makes no distinction between cruelty to man and toward animals.28 The defeat of idealism by animalistic guards who torture peasants much as onlookers torture a bull offers a good example: "hay que prolongar el juego hasta el limite, apurar su agonia hasta la hez" (SI, pp. 152-53). Thus the spectators throw stones at a young bull while others cut him with a knife. The bull, for Goytisolo, also exem- plifies the sexual process, a rather standard identification. In Cretan culture bulls represented fertility; in our culture they reflect masculine virility. But, as we have seen, for Goytisolo they may also be vic- tims. When Claudia sees the bull fight, she muses on the absurdity of life, and her alienation takes on an almost physical presence (I, p. 79). In addition to the emptiness she feels, she accepts Dolores's symbolic interpretation, linking the specta- tors with a lack of sexual prowess. As in Enrique's case, this identification creates the reverse of machismo (I, p. 135). On the other hand, when Gorila visits the whore- houses, he begins to bellow like a bull (F., p. 148). Dogs, man's best friends, reflect that relationship as well as the more aggressive and bloodthirsty instincts of man. From the moment Abel arrives at Paraiso, the dog seems to understand him and licks his hands. Abel plans to go off to war but not without Lucero whom he believes to be "mis listo que muchas personas ..." (DP, p. 55). Gorila claims his female dog loves him as much as he loves her: "es mi finica mujer" (F, p. 138). But hungry dogs and bloody wolves also represent aggression; a dog's teeth become a hypodermic needle (CJ, pp. 104-05, 210, 35); and the intestines of the disemboweled little donkey, Platero, will make a jump rope for a little girl, who herself will die of rabies (p. 147). Dogs then become associated with death. When El6segui hears the news of Dora's death, he restrains a crazy impulse to run to her room and smell her bed "como un perro" (DP, p. 58). And, of course, the author links dogs with sexual contact. Juliain associates his syphilis with "perros hambrientos," and the dog who bit him licks up the decap- itated cock's blood from the floor (CJ, pp. 103-05). The rooster, its severed head a displacement from below,29 implies, in addition to castration, impotence versus virility. Other incidents involving dogs occur in LR (p. 193), SI (p. 126) and JT (pp. 25, 151). In Reivindicaci6n del Conde don Julidn insects appear as a symbol of human life and especially of children,30 as we can see in the time trip taken in the dispensary (CJ, pp. 64, 107-08). Insect imagery, a constant in Goytisolo's novels, concerns adults also. In El Circo Utah meets a woman in a bar who "evolucionaba en la pista como un insecto aturdido por la luz" (EC, p. 18). In Serias de identidad Anto- nio's friend's wife looks at him "como a un insecto de especie . . . inclasificable" (SI, p. 211).3' Goytisolo also reinforces his descriptions of inanimate objects through insect imagery: "la gramola continu6 girando como un insecto torpe" (JM, p. 68); "los farolillos . . . emitian destellos de</page><page sequence="8">Fauna in the Novels of Juan Goytisolo 547 luci6rnaga. . . ." (DP, p. 141).32 In attacking the capitalistic system, an artificial Spanish graft, Goytisolo also castigates, in zoological terms, the influx of tourists and the United States presence. The narrator of Juan sin Tierra wonders whether the grasshopper or the locust bene- fits most from the surplus value of the ant, though he admits that some blame the bumblebee, dragonfly, glowworm, or even the ant itself, because of its love for work which causes the surplus value. Statisti- cally, without applying an elitist criterion to the various fauna, he gives equal oppor- tunities to all species, including bedbugs, lice, and other parasites (JT, pp. 246-47). The political-insect relationship occurs in most of his novels. Arturo gives the same attention to Murcian shacks that Paco affords his ants, and for the same reason, because they attack the beauty of the status quo: "Para sacudirse las pulgas necesitan entrar en mi cuarto." Francisco compares them to flies, and Arturo, associating them with ants, believes that the police should whisk them all into a bag "como cucara- chas" (F, pp. 22, 114, 174, 181). The young apprentice weavers, condemned to work for a master spider who lays eggs in her victims to feed the next spider generation, are trapped insects, who, paralyzed by the poison, wait helplessly as the spider "pone sus huevos .. ." (CJ, pp. 63-64).11 When Mozart's Requiem stops, the silence is broken only by the "canto de los grillos y el sonoro croar de alguna rana," a most persistent image, but the Requiem, in a sense, is also a funeral for Spain; the croak- ing frogs and chirping crickets reflect the empty words of Alvaro's relatives in attempting to justify their actions, much as moths become associated in Alvaro's mind with Eulogio's passion for the stars, "entre la polilla y telarafia" (SI, pp. 32, 34). Goytisolo's most aggressive attacks involving insects occur in Reivindicacid6n del Conde don Julidn, and they are both executioners and victims. Juliain slaughters insects in preparation for his attack on Spanish culture, and insects, themselves victims of carnivorous plants, help in the destruction of Peranzules. Julifin smashes the sponger-centipede (p. 235). Goytisolo attacks the stultifying effects of the Gener- ation of '98, the Senecan inheritance, and the Spanish readiness to herd together in masses. Seneca, incarnated as a bullfighter, has his supporters, "enjambres, como abe- jitas" (CJ, p. 120), and ironically insects will later destroy his other incarnation. Govtisolo associates insects, done in by in- secticides, with Spanish literature, as Juliin collects flies, ants, beetles, horseflies, bees, and cockroaches which he duly deposits in selected volumes of Spanish classics. Alvaro Peranzules, observing the pointless existence of hominids and invertebrate masses and, able to identify a true "capra hispainica" by the smell of its dung (CJ, pp. 81-82), matches his firm principles with his crustacean appearance. A cross between a mammal and a medieval warrior, he recites a crustacean sonnet, evoking the tradition of Castile against a background of attack- ing dogs (CJ, pp. 160-162), and as he con- tinues with the classics, he discovers crush- ed flies spattered over the drama. He tries desperately to choose other volumes for his declamations and evocation of Spanish tradition as insects buzz around him, but they escape in swarms from the book, multiply, and result in the death of Alvaro and the "capra hispinica" (CJ, pp. 179- 84). Although Alvaro, in Serias de identidad, constantly associates the works of men with insects, we see the connection more clearly in Reivindicaci6n del Conde don Julidn. The narrator, in the dispensary, mentally returning to his Natural Sciences class some twenty-five years earlier, relates the morphology of the scorpion and the arachnids, and, viewing a defenseless grass- hopper trapped in a jar with which he iden- tifies, recalls his horror when his teacher grasped him by the collar and obliged him to watch (pp. 91-93). Creative writing and day dreams substitute for what was once the play of childhood, a constant Freudian implication in the novel. Unlike conscious memories during maturity, "childhood memories are not fixed at the moment of being experienced and afterwards repeated, but are only elicited at a later age when childhood is already past; in the process they are altered and falsified, and are put into the service of later trends, so that generally speaking they cannot be sharply distinguished from phantasies."34 Antonio identifies sexual relations as a way of dying, and in his relationship to the whore, a bad woman and a dangerous object to</page><page sequence="9">548 Kessel Schwartz Hispania 64 (December 1981) love, associates the act with a spider, sym- bolic both of danger and mother (SI, p. 214). He also links the death of his father to "el hondo zumbido de las cigarras" (SI, p. 115), an image exactly repeated later (p. 160). Throughout Duelo en el Paraiso the author emphasizes human moods through animal imagery. El Arcaingel destroys the reflection of the gray tadpole because of his self guilt; the advancing soldiers encounter butterflies, bees, and a fleeing cat, and Sergeant Santos imagines snakes, lizards with fly eyes, fearful rabbits, "todo un mundo de animalejos . . . hormigas, gri- llos, cigarras, cucarachas, insectos hostiles ." (p. 122). The soldier guarding Abel's body feels horror at the fly buzzing about the bullet hole (DP, p. 183). El Gallego senses that "las mariposas, los hombres que marchaban acoplados, no eran otra cosa que un turbio impulso hacia la muerte" (DP, p. 189). IN HIS MORAL COMMITMENT which he phrases in frustrated and at times night- marish terms, Goytisolo uses animals to reflect negatively the entire range of moral, idealistic, psychological, and physical char- acteristics of the Spanish people, their religion, machismo, stoicism, literature, hymenolatry, honor, and language. He refuses to acknowledge his country except in subservient or destructive terms, as he attacks the values which he feels have cir- cumscribed it and prevented its maturation as an important member of the world scene.

'In Sehas de identidad, for example, Alvaro links the death of the Yeste peasants with the running of the bulls, vultures, and dogs, and a crowing rooster (pp. 122, 149-51, 143). Lucas's death is specifically related to the noise of frogs (p. 157); and prisoners awaiting execution, identify with a flock of birds in the sky (p. 477). 6He employs the same image in other novels, for example, "aletargada fauna" (CJ, p. 17) and "penin- sular fauna" (JT, p. 179).
