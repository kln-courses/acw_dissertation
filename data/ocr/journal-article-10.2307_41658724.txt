IMAGES OF CONQUEST Scholars in the Dominican Republic study a Columbus-era Taino town and some intriguing rock art. u The the to the Indians Taino, island who after of Hispaniola welcomed a word that have Christopher meant become "good" Columbus known or as to the island of Hispaniola have become known as the Taino, after a word that meant "good" or "noble" in their own language. Columbus wrote of them that there were "in all the world no better people." Despite his words of admiration, relations between Euro- peans and Indians soon deteriorated, and by 1525 the Taino had been wiped out by disease and warfare. New investigations at a large Columbus-period Taino settle- ment and a number of caves with rock art and evidence of habitation are expected to add significantly to our understanding of this extinct culture. The site is in the Dominican Republic's East National Park, about 200 miles south-southeast of La Isabela. Called La Aleta, meaning "the fin," the site was named 20 years ago for a shed with a thatched roof resembling a fish's fin. Our work with the East National Park Archaeo- logical Project is an attempt to understand the rise, flores- cence, and collapse of Taino culture on the southeastern tip of Hispaniola. At the time of European discovery this area was part of the chiefdom of Higiiey, one of the rich- est and most populous parts of the Caribbean. A collabo- rative undertaking of the East National Park, the Universidad Católica Santo Domingo, and Indiana Uni- versity, the project is supervised by Dominican archaeolo- gists Marcio Veloz Maggiolo, Elpidio Ortega, and Abelardo Jiménez Lambertos. La Aleta may have been a town in the territory of the cacique (chief) Cotubanamá, where in 1503 a Spanish force led by Captain-General Juan de Esquivel massacred 600 to 700 Higüey Tainos to punish them for rebelling after another chief was disemboweled by a Spanish attack dog. One measure of the size and importance of Taino towns was the number of stone-walled plazas, which were used for ceremonies and a ritual ball game. Until recently the site was known to have had only one plaza and was thought to have been inhabited only for seasonal cere- monies. In the past few months, however, researchers have discovered three more plazas and household debris, possible evidence of a much larger, year-round occupa- tion. Two of the plazas are oriented north-south, while the other two run east-west. They range from 50 to 150 feet By Geoffrey Conrad, John Foster, Charles Beeker, Lynn Uhls, Mark Brauner, Marcio Veloz Maggiolo, and Elpídio Ortega 60 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">A pictograph from the José Maria Cave may represent a Spanish caravel. long and 25 to 70 feet wide. (All measurements are provisional, pend- ing excavation.) Most of the site is still hidden beneath tropical forest, and the total number of plazas is yet to be determined. The current total of four, however, is already one of the highest in the Caribbean, and La Aleta may eventually prove to be on the scale of the largest known Taino site, Caguana (also known as Capá) in Puerto Rico, which has nine plazas and dance courts. One unique feature of La Aleta is a ceremonial cenote, or water- filled sinkhole. In exploratory work last fall, divers recovered artifacts at depths ranging from 115 to 240 feet below the sur- face of the water, which is itself 50 feet below the land surface. The artifacts, which seem to have been ritual offerings, included ornate pottery, clubs and other wooden objects, bas- kets, and incised gourds, all remarkably well preserved in the anaerobic environment. Two radiocarbon dates indicate that the cenote was used from at least A.D. 1200 to 1500. Elsewhere in the park, we are investigating a series of caves with rock art, both pictographs (paintings) and petroglyphs (incised carvings). Test excava- tions in the Cueva de Berna by Marcio Veloz Maggiolo and Elpidio Ortega in 1975 and 1977 revealed up to ten feet of archaeological deposits, with human burials, animal and plant remains, hearths, grinding stones, shell scrapers, and other artifacts dating back as far as 2000 B.c. The cave was sup- posed to have been named Cueva de Bernard, but when a man was hired to paint a sign for tourists, he made the letters too big and ran out of room. The new name, Cueva de Berna, stuck. The most spectacular of the caves is José Maria, discov- ered in 1980 by Abelardo Jiménez and named for the couple who owned the land before it was incorporated into the park. It may contain the most complex painted rock art in the Higiiey region, and perhaps on all of His- paniola. From a small limestone escarpment, the main Diver Paul Caputo , above , descends 50 feet to the wa- ter-filled ceremonial cenote at La Aleta , where Charles Beeker , below , recovers Taino pottery. и s 0 1 chambers are entered through a tiny opening. The walls are painted with black figures of bats, frigate birds, and turtles, red crosses, and anthro- pomorphic beings. These are clus- tered in scenes that may represent episodes in Taino mythology. One scene, for example, seems to depict the sun and the moon emerging from a cave - the creation of the world, according to an account of Taino religion written by Father Ramón Pané at Columbus' request in ca. 1494. The innermost painted cham- ber contains designs that may be from the conquest period. One is a bearded face - maybe a Span- iard, or perhaps an early Taino portrait of Christ. Another scene includes what seem to be sym- bols for plants, cooking imple- ments, and bread and may depict the terms of a 1503 treaty that offered peace in exchange for delivery of native cassava bread to the Spanish capital at Santo Domingo. On the far right of this "tribute scene" is the painted image of a sailing ship, perhaps the first rendering of a Spanish vessel in native New World art. The study of the cultural resources of the East National Park is a long-term project. Test excavations earlier this year around the plazas of La Aleta, supervised by the Dominican project directors, will be followed by more extensive excavations at the site, both on land and in the cenote. Study of the rock-art caves and other sites in the park will also continue. ■ Geoffrey Conrad is director of the William Hammond Mathers Museum and professor of anthropology at Indiana University , Bloomington.
