<plain_text><page sequence="1">Commentary on Margolis' Paper ' 'Mental States" Brian Lahren University of Nevada, Reno In an article recently published in Behaviorism, Joseph Margolis (1975) offered the observation that radical behaviorists were mistaken in thinking that an intentionalistic interpretation of mental states could ever be replaced by an account involving only physical phenomena or purely physical processes. His arguments were complex, tightly argued, and generally directed to philosophers rather than behavioral psychologists. Nevertheless, it is clear that his basic assumptions conflict with what behaviorists take to be the case about the nature of verbal behavior. Related to this disagreement about the nature of verbal behavior are basic differences in behavioristic and intentionalistic interpretations of purposive behavioral episodes and the ontological status of mental events. In what follows I will offer a simplified version of Margolis' arguments concern ing these matters and contrast them with their behavioral alternatives. Then I will go on to sketch a behavioral interpretation of intentionality and talk of mental states. The Philosophical Thesis of Intentionality Margolis develops a network of argument concerning the implications which seem ingly follow from our ascriptions of mental states to human beings and other sentient creatures. The elements of his argument are drawn from a larger cluster of related argument and position-statements which constitute a widely held philosophical perspec tive on the nature of conscious experience. Whatever else intentionalist philosophers may say about conscious experience or mental states, they generally agree that such events are in some sense directed toward, or related to, other events external to them selves or to other aspects of conscious experience. This characteristic of human mental phenomena is referred to as its intentionality. Intentionalistic considerations that human psychological phenomena are of a certain composition are usually arrived at by examining sentences of the form "I believe that X." Such statements may involve any of a large number of psychologically relevant verbs (e.g., intend, want, judge, pretend, love, etc.). In the intentionalistic analysis of our sample sentence, the verb ' 'believe" would be construed as implying the existence of a mental act or state, while the phrase "that X" would be taken to imply the separate existence (at least in consciousness) of another entity or event. The referent of the former has a subjective character, the latter, usually objective. Notice, however, that in this 77</page><page sequence="2">Brian Lahren philosophical view, the subject and predicate are construed as having meaning in virtue of their naming objects or events. In other words, there is an implicit nominalist theory of meaning imbedded in this way of interpreting a psychologically revealing statement (Gale, 1967). Nominalism involves a claim about the nature of functional processes involved in verbal behavior. For example, an analysis of sentences ascriptive of mental state terms is said by Margolis to imply (1) that there be such things as mental states, and (2) that such states have "propositional import, propositional content, or take propositions as their intentional objects" (p. 23). That is, according to this popular intentionalist interpreta tion, the subjective component of the dyadic intentional relation is considered to be some kind of mental act having precisely the quality needed to account for the propositional character of those speech acts from which it was initially inferred. In addition, the other component of our sample sentence (the "that" clause) is called the proposition or propositional object. Thus, the characteristic property of mental acts, their intentionality, is equivalent to, or explained by, human capacities for propositional mental states and this capacity is reflected in the characteristics of direct speech acts. To a behaviorist this inferential sequence seems circular. Since it is obvious that the primary means human beings have of communicating about their private psychological events is verbal, it is not surprising that the inten tionalistic philosophical position on the nature of mental states is based upon the features and implications derivable from the logical analysis of that class of sentences which relate significant information about the occurrence of our behavioral activities. This approach, based upon logical analysis, may be contrasted with a fundamentally different exploration, by behaviorists, of the environmental circumstances which hold for those situations in which human beings learn to describe themselves and their actions. Behaviorists do not subscribe to a unitary theory of "relations to consciousness" as the basis for their understanding of the meaning of utterances, but take meanings (emotive, connotative and denoti ve) to result from a human being's history of participa tion in those patterns of environmental circumstance, including behaviors and their attendant consequences, which may be unique to an individual or shared by other members of a verbal community. The relations, established in the environment, between a human being with capacities for verbal behavior and any given pattern of events, provide conditions which will support many kinds of verbal behavior and many kinds of meanings. Our verbal responding reflects the effects of the environmental contexts in which it was acquired and maintained. Our utterances have a natural meaning to us which is the product of the circumstances in which we have learned the various kinds of verbal behaviors which characterize a language community. Verbal responses also have mean ings to listeners which derive from the ways in which the utterances of others have been occasions for consequences of various kinds. According to Skinner (1974): ... the meaning of a response is not in its topography or form . . . [nor] in the current setting but in a history of exposure to contingencies in which similar settings have played a part. In other words, meaning is not properly regarded as a property either of a response or a situation but rather of the contingencies responsible for both the topography of behavior and the control exerted by stimuli, (p. 90) 78</page><page sequence="3">Commentary on Margolis Paper "Mental States With respect to intentional interpretations of mental states, behaviorists foresee many difficulties. For example, the practices of one's verbal community may be so constrained by convention, or by the natural limitations inherent in certain kinds of event presenta tions, that nomination, or the one-to-one relation of word and object, may not obtain. It is likely that this is the case for4'mental terms" and terms ordinarily taken to be explicative of our on-going behavior (cf., Skinner, 1957, 130-134). Beyond this, it is not clear to anyone the extent to which different patterns of event-word relationships yield (or do not yield) describable differences in the features of verbal responses themselves. Just where these realities leave logical inferences based upon the grammatical features of language, I do not care to speculate. Without a more direct analysis of the environmental situations in which we learn to utter statements having specific terms, specific grammatical forms, or the logical indicators of intentionality, a behaviorist would not find agreeable the assumption that such statements or their indicators imply there must be mental events or objects of any particular kind, namely having 44propositional import, propositional content," etc. Intentions An intention, as a kind of mental state, has a role in the explanation of human action that it holds in addition to sharing in the general philosophical thesis of intentionality. Intentions, in particular, are construed to be the kinds of psychological happenings which have the potential to explain the significant features of purposive or consequence oriented behavior. Support for this claim is often derived, in part, from the fact that what usually satisfies us in the everyday explanation of our actions, or the actions of others, is reference to wants, intentions, beliefs and so forth. In this philosophical view human beings are assumed to have unique capacities for the mental determination of their own behavior. As a result, philosophical analysis of the various doctrines of intentionality tend also to engage the analysis of explanatory concepts appropriate to the social sciences. Such analyses are usually concerned with clarifying how these special human capacities, and the explanatory concepts derivable from them, are to be employed (cf., Taylor, 1964; Harr? &amp; Secord, 1972). Focusing on these issues, interest in human intentionality constitutes a major element in the contem porary Zeitgeist of both psychology and philosophy, as it has since the publication of Brentano's Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt in 1874. This same contemporary interest has become incorporated into the core of an even more pervasive and historically important Western cultural viewpoint on the nature of human activity. This cultural viewpoint may comfortably bear a number of different labels depending upon the particular elements of argument and position which are juxtaposed in any particular discipline or literary tradition. However, taken together, all of these formulations of argument-networks constitute both the embodiment and the defense of what Skinner (1971) has attacked as the traditional view of "autonomous man," and what Day (1976) calls the Agency interpretation of man. Contemporary behaviorism finds itself in con frontation with this cultural tradition of explanatory practice as it strives to develop an ever clearer understanding of those "behavioral processes which have given rise to what are usually called higher mental processes" (Skinner, 1974, p. 102). 79</page><page sequence="4">Brian Lahren Margolis' Argument for Intentional States In "Mental States," Margolis contributes to the clarification of the intentionalist viewpoint on the nature of mental states and offers his assessment of how the implications of his position appear to confront the implicit physicalism of Skinnerian behaviorism. His argument combines elements whose particulars were developed in the works of the contemporary philosophers R.M. Chisolm (1957, 1966), P.T. Geach (1957) and A. Kenny (1963). Chisolm has developed a number of logical criteria which are present in the features of the language we use in talking about mental or psychological phenomena. The aim of his work is to show that the sentences we use in describing mental or psychological phenomena form a logically distinct class of sentences, irreducible to any class of sentences used to describe non-mental or non-psychological phenomena. Chisolm's criteria for psychological or intentional statements, and the arguments and refinements which have accompanied their appearance, make it clear that philosophers are not trying to discover which particular statements reveal intentional features but rather are trying to develop ever more explicit criteria for a notion of intentionality which seems to be independently understandable, either by pre-analytic intuition or as a result of philosophical analysis (Marras, 1972). Should this be the outcome of such a logical analysis, it would seemingly bode ill for such non-intentional accounts of psychological phenomena as behaviorists or materialists offer. Margolis adopts this conclusion on page 28 of his article, although he has previously called attention to the inadequacy of Chisolm's present criteria with respect to statements about pains, aches, and perceptual phenomena. With respect to the development of his thesis about mental states, Margolis adopts the position that thought is importantly related to our human capacities fjr speech. The formal assimilation of mental and verbal episodes which he uses is one developed by P. Geach in Mental Acts (1957) and A. Kenny in Action, Emotion, and Will (1963). According to Geach and Kenny, a mental episode may be described as being made up of conceptual elements or mental utterances appropriately related to one another, in a sense analogous to the way in which a verbal episode is made up of words or physical utterances, grammatically and syntactically related. Margolis' argument is that when we regard an entity as sentient or intelligent we also suppose that predications of belief, perception, intention and the like may be properly made of it. Further, it is also to suppose that what is affirmed or ascribed in making those predications are mental states of a certain sort, namely "states that have propositional import, or propositional content, or take propositions as their intentional objects" (p. 23). He identifies the most lucid account of intentioanl mental states as being Kenny's, where a report of such a mental state is treated metaphorically, i.e., as being equivalent to ". . .a report of a mental utterance of a quoted expression" (p. 23). Thus, according to Margolis mental states either are verbal in nature, being the propositional mental acts underlying direct speech acts, or we do them no great injustice by describing them as though they were very much like those utterances by means of which their occurrence is related. 80</page><page sequence="5">Commentary on Margolis1 Paper "Mental States11 If we allow that certain human mental states can be at least minimally interpreted as analogous to a direct speech act, then Margolis thinks it easy to see why we characterize the mental states of non-human sentient creatures in the way that we do, i.e.,44. . . as if it [the creature's mental state] were the oratio obliqua counter part [third person account] of some direct speech act" (p. 24). According to Margolis, our characterizations of sentient and intelligent creatures, as such, involves the same ascriptions of intentional mental characteristics that we seem to imply in human cases. Thus, such accounts must be parasitic on our characterizations of persons, that is, 44. . . of beings literally capable of direct speech" (p. 24). Margolis takes this to be an important conclusion. He assumes our ascriptive activities to reflect linguistic convention, but even more significantly, to derive from our understanding of our own experience. It is in this light that he tries to explain why animal psychology is troubled by tendencies to anthropomorphize animal behavior. Moreover, he argues that our ascriptions of sentience and intelligence to animals not only often are, but must be anthropomorphic 44. . . in terms of approximating to, or being altered adjustments of, comparable ascriptions to human persons" (p. 24). For him, our ascriptions of mental states to animals are not simply difficult to extricate from the characteristic way we account for human behavior, but in fact, goes well beyond to claim that4'dependence on the speech act model" of mental states is an ineliminable bedrock upon which our picture of human nature itself is built. The evidence for this is that what we ascribe to ourselves and other sentient creatures are mental states, linguistically characterized. There appears no way, in Margolis' view, to escape linguistically framed intentional accounts. In following Margolis' argument to this point, care must be taken to assess what he is attempting to accomplish. Clearly, he is building argumentative support for an agency viewpoint by linking a doctrine of intentional explanation of behavior to the unique capacities of human beings for verbal behavior. However, no matter how convenient or economical it would be if our mental events were in fact the same as, or very much like, the verbal events their occurrence occasions (and this may be so for a certain number of cases), behaviorism argues that we must be careful to keep open the possibility that there may be important reasons to distinguish between what we say of an event by way of 4'description," and what it is possible to imply given the relation which holds between the descriptive verbal behavior and the events which occasion it. Caution is particularly important when ' ' mental events" are seen to be implied because of the features possessed by instances of self-description isolated from their contexts of occurrence. The point is this: until we understand more precisely the behavioral realities which underlie nomina tion and description with respect to private psychological events, or even public ones for that matter, we should be careful about taking our descriptions as entailments for some particular philosophical stance on the nature and importance of mental phenomena. What is involved in the development of Margolis' position in this respect is an inference about the nature of mental states based upon structural descriptions of the characteristics of direct speech acts. It is inferred that mental states have a propositional import which is responsible for the propositional character of language. Yet the proposi tional character of language is a describable property of statements regardless of what 81</page><page sequence="6">Brian Lahren ever the processes which generate speech acts may be. The nature of mental events as explanatory processes is inferred, here, from the structural properties of grammatical statements. As Margolis has it, ". . .it appears impossible to provide an analysis of the intentional states in question without reference to explicit speech" (p. 24). In addition, the ascription of mental states ". . . requires an Intentional and teleological idiom parasitic on the Intentional, rule governed features of language itself . . ." (p. 30). Leaving aside the issue of teleology for a moment, both the intentional features of language and its rule governed nature are properties of language which are describable independently of generative processes. Such characterizations are structural descriptions appropriate to isolated linguistic events. Yet, Margolis construes mental states to be generative processes, or as the behaviorist would have it, processes responsible for the functional properties of verbal behavior. Catania (1972) has provided a useful discussion of the extent to which similar structural-to-functional inferences are inappropriate in psycholinguistics, where structural descriptions of language events are often the eviden tial basis for claims about generative processes in language (cf., Chomsky, 1968). Catania's assessment is that there are inherent difficulties involved in moving from structural descriptions of linguistic events ? such as the logical properties of mental predication or the description of grammatical sentences which we know as the "rules of language" ? to the description of the processes responsible for the functional properties of verbal behavior. The structural descriptions of linguistic events are not the information needed to understand why a person says a particularly appropriate thing on any given occasion. According to Catania, "[a]s we analyze any segment of speech or writing, we may become interested either in the circumstances under which that verbal behavior was emitted or in its internal organization. When we study the circumstances of emission, we are dealing with the functional properties of language: the conditions that set the occasion for behavior, and its potential consequences (e.g., Premack, 1970; Skinner, 1957)" (p. 1). Catania's assessment is central to an understanding of radical behavioristic interest in language. As behaviorists we are committed to a continuing exploration of the relation of verbal utterances to the situations in which they occur. This interest involves an addi tional consideration, beyond the features of the verbal response itself, of how the practices of one's verbal community act to shape the standard forms of expression which philosophers and psycholinguists so precisely identify and interrelate. The way we respond verbally may be accurately, though only partially, described in terms of the uttered responses themselves. Philosophers are usually more articulate with respect to this dimension of verbal behavior and its linkage with other logically related verbal constructions than are most psychologists. Nevertheless, behaviorist interest focuses upon an additional dimension of verbal behavior: the antecedent and consequential events which form the context in which an utterance occurs. An interest in the results which derive from such an analysis cannot be supplanted by mere description of the topographical features of records of verbal behavior, or by the complex ways in which a given response is related to other logically entailed verbal constructions which cannot be shown to have been part of the occasion of the original response. Behaviorists insist on the importance of extending their analysis beyond the parameters of the verbal response itself, to the relations between the response, and the contexts in which it has historically, and does presently, occur. 82</page><page sequence="7">Commentary on Margolis' Paper "Mental States" Thus, for a behaviorist, Margolis' claim of the ineliminability of the speech act model seems to function not as an entailed conclusion, but as an announcement or position statement and as an introduction to his next agenda item: the dismissal of Skinner's (1953) and Quine's (1960) arguments against the employment of an anthropomorphic phenomenology as a starting point for the analysis of animal and human nature or alien linguistic concepts (p. 24). I will only remark at this point that while a behaviorist would agree with Margolis' observation that our ascriptions of intelligence and various mental states to animals are often clearly parasitic on our ascriptions of like qualities to human beings, one would nevertheless want to disagree with the claim that such ascriptions necessitate that mental states be of a particular sort, or that we must ascribe them either to animals or humans. Let me simply assert, foi the moment, that neither animal nor human activities need be construed only in terms of the implications derived from the speech act model of intentional mental states. This will be discussed in more detail in connection with an implicit claim by Margolis that there is no adequate, presently available, conceptual alternative to his position; but first, I will summarize the remainder of his argument and its implications for central state materialistic theses. The Argument Against Materialist Ontologies With his initial analysis of the nature of ascriptions of sentience to intelligent beings set forth, Margolis turns to the implications his analysis has for a central state materialist account of mental states. His analysis proceeds by examining two central state materialist positions: Armstrong (1968) and Dennet (1969), both of whom offer arguments attempt ing to justify the identification of various mental states with neurophysiological states of the brain. Armstrong and Dennet present but two of a number of differing materialist theses concerning the nature of mental events. Attempts to construe mental events materialistically can approach the problem in a variety of different ways (see, e.g., Campbell, 1967). However, with respect to the examples which follow, two particular theses of materialism are most relevant. In one version of materialism, mental state terms are taken to be occasioned by characteristic patterns of behavior which in turn are construed as dispositional physical processes. In the other version, where such a dispositional analysis does not seem plausible (as in the case of pains and after-images), the mental states or events are considered to be states of the CNS presented to itself in some opaque or covert fashion. Materialists either argue that such interpretations of mental states at least offer the most promising lines of investigation now open (a position labeled "functional materialism") or go further and maintain that any alternative view is already frankly incredible (a position labeled "eliminative materialism"). Armstrong (1969, 1973), who is considered first by Mar golis, finds both eliminad ve and functional materialism congenial. Armstrong's materialist thesis lands in trouble when, in the process of trying to imagine evidence which would differentiate or show identity between two beliefs ("if p then q") and ("if q then p"), he says he would look to some "future theoretical identifications or correlations of neurophysiology to settle such questions . . ." (p. 28). Margolis immediately sees a difficulty here, and denies that such evidence can provide a 83</page><page sequence="8">Brian Lahren reductive identity of beliefs with neurophysiological states of the brain. This is so because the beliefs in question are already characterized in terms of the speech model (the state is characterized by the statement "if p then q" or vice versa) and all we can do is assign mental states already characterized as speech acts to correlated neurophysical processes. If the intentionality assumed in the ascription of mental states cannot be avoided, then whatever neurophysiological correlations might be found could only be ones which would match the linguistically interpreted intentionality already characteris tic of the inferred mental act. Armstrong's thesis would not appear to offer a reductive neurophysiological alternative to the initial characterization of mental acts as intentional, at least not in the sense of freeing his account from the constraints of an a priori linguistic-intentional form. Dennet's (1969) account is closer to Skinnerian behaviorism in some respects. Dennet first argues that the existence of neural structures can be given a non-teleological characterization in terms of the process of natural selection. This is possible since the phenomena of natural selection are initially introduced non-teleologically. Margolis grants this as obvious and unobjectionable. It is when Dennet attempts to extend this non-telelogical account to encompass ' 'the ascription of content or meaning to particular central states of the brain' ' (p. 28) that Margolis objects. The objection is that in allowing a non-teleological account to be given of phenomena whose particulars are initially introduced non-teleologically (e.g., neurophysiological structures) we have not settled any questions about the reducibility of phenomena whose initial characteristics are intentional and teleological (e.g., the mental states we ascribe to sentient creatures and persons). According to Margolis, Dennet offers no argument to show precisely how it would be possible to reduce the intentional mental states that we ascribe to persons and sentient creatures to non-teleological analogues of the evolutionary explanation which suffices for neural structures. The problem stems from a concession by Dennet that mental states are ascribed to creatures or persons and not to brains. This leads Margolis to the plausible interpretation that whereas one might accept the appropriateness of a physical conceptual system, still, mental events are not merely casually attached to physical concepts as a secondary quality; mental states are experienced as the very realities which are also (and presumably later) denoted by a subset of physical concepts. In a further move to clarify the relations between those physical states constituting awareness, and behavior, Dennet proposes two "sub-personal" terms as criteria for mental states having potential physical descriptions: (1) A is aware i that p at time t if and only if p is the content of the input state of A's 'speech center' at time t. (2) A is aware2 that/7 at time t if and only \?p is the content of an internal event in A at time t that is effective in directing current behavior, (p. 29) Margolis objects that although these may indeed be empirically necessary and sufficient conditions for awarenessi and awareness2, neither can be said to supply sub-personal criteria of awareness of either sort. That is so because nothing could be construed as the propositional content of input to either A's speech center or any other internal event except on the basis of an a priori linguistically based intentional characterization of the person or creature of whom it is made. Such a prior characterization, by Dennet's own 84</page><page sequence="9">Commentary on Margolis1 Paper "Mental States" admission, is originally made of creatures or of persons and not of brains (or brain states) and hence, his sub-personal criteria are "really elliptical versions of full blown personal criteria ..." (p. 29). Margolis takes this to be supportive of his claim that teleological and intentional characterizations of the behavior of persons and sentient creatures are "primitive" in the sense that they are the initial characterizations upon which all further or alternative accounts (e.g., neurophysiological accounts) are parasitic. Furthermore, he asserts that our ascriptions are metaphorical, hence linguistically dependent, and that linguistic contexts cannot be reduced to physical contexts (p. 27). Given these considerations regarding Armstrong and Dennet, and his prior argu ments and assertions concerning the implausibility of an equally fundamental alternative to his account, Margolis concludes that there is little prospect of eliminating persons or sentient creatues as emergent entities for whom it is appropriate to ascribe intentions and intentional mental states having propositional import. Such ascriptions assume that the entity involved is of a "minimally rational sort" which he describes as being an entity assumed to behave "in accord with certain teleological models ..." (p. 26). In whatever way one arrives at an assessment that a creature is sentient, Margolis recognizes that such a conclusion must be based upon a consideration of the behavior of the entity as a whole. Further, the sense that is made of the behavior of an animal or a person is made, at least in part, on the basis of the apparent relatedness of the behavior to the context in which it occurs. Teleological characterizations affirm that with respect to this relatedness there is something important in the relationship between a behavioral episode and the terminal state of affairs seen to be relevant or to be produced by it. However, in order to explain the relatedness of behavior to objects or states of affairs toward which it seems directed, Margolis finds it necessary to attribute an additional characteristic which transcends mere physical description, that is, a consciousness in the sense of intentionality. The nature of this intentionality is additionally refined by incorporating into it the speech act interpretation of Geach and Kenny. It is a contention of Margolis that our ascriptions of intentional mental states are based upon an ineliminable picture of human functioning developed from an intuitive under standing of our own experiences. The conjunction of this intuitive awareness of one's own private psychological processes with the seeming appropriateness of teleological characterizations of many behavior episodes is seen as warranting some special form of accounting for human functioning. ... the specification and explanation of [sentient creatures'] characteristic properties requires an Intentional and teleological idiom parasitic on the Inten tional, rule governed features of language itself, which properties appear irreduc ible to purely physical phenomena. ... (p. 30) A fundamental aspect of this warranting argument ? the view of one's reliably interpreting the processes of one's consciousness ? has been generally acknowledged to be confused (Ryle, 1949; Wittgenstein, 1953; Skinner, 1957; Quine, 1960; Anscombe, 1966). Unfortunately, the non-teleological alternatives to the intentionalist view so far presented have fallen short of providing a satisfactory account. In the remainder of this paper I will offer philosophical considerations which oppose the thesis that it is possible to base an account of human actions on either an ordinary language based analysis or an?z 85</page><page sequence="10">Brian Lahren priori presumption of the appropriateness of our intuitive understanding of our own psychological processes. This will be followed by the presentation of a parallel to Dennet's natural selection argument, taken from B.F. Skinner's identification of the selecting effects of reinforcing consequences in op?rant behaviors. This parallel selec tion process operating in on-going behavioral episodes provides entry into a non teleological behavioral analysis which avoids the necessity of attributing special causal processes to our mental or psychological experiences. Finally it will be argued that identification of op?rant behaviors and occasions for ascribing mental predicates can both be seen to have the same ontological status. Verbal Behavior and Private Events The contention that mental state terms are primitive seems to result, in part, from construing the functioning of mental state words on analogy with the nominational pattern which seems to hold for terms related to physical objects. However, the objective features of the situations in which we learn mental terms and their usage are not direct equivalents of the ones in which we learn object-name relationships. Since mental utterances are learned in the context of a significantly different situational encounter, their usage cannot be taken to present unequivocal evidence for the special referential quality claimed to be a feature of intentional mental states following the model of simple object-name relationships. Wittgenstein (1953) has offered an essentially behavioristic philosophical analysis of sensation words and Skinner (1957) has provided an analysis of a wide variety of other mental terms. Both of these analyses oppose Margolis' claim of the conceptual irreduci bility of linguistically based mental state interpretations. Both argue that neither sensa tion nor mental state terms can be derived from private ostensive definition. Wittgen stein's assessment, presented in the context of a critique of purely private languages and private linguistic rule following, is that: . . . words are connected with the primitive, the natural expressions of the sensations and used in their place. A child has hurt himself and he cries; and then adults talk to him and teach him exclamations and later, sentences ... the verbal expression of pain replaces crying and does not describe it! (PI, 244) B.F. Skinner's (1957) analysis of the contingencies operating in the contexts where we learn intentional-mental terms and their conventional use provides an alternative to intentionalistic nominalism and shares similarities with Wittgenstein's position (Day, 1969). A brief overview of Skinner's assessment is that we do not learn to name our mental states by private ostensive definition; rather we learn self descriptive verbal repertoires in contexts where our public behaviors, and occasionally, accompanying private events, form the appropriate and presumably reinforced occasions for self descriptions in our verbal community. The fact that the verbal events which are identifi able as self descriptions or explanations are also describable as having certain structural properties does not weigh on the question of whether or not those same verbal events have a functional relationship to determining conditions in the environment. Our developmen tally prior non-verbal behaviors are to be considered the occasions or natural expressions to which the pre-existing language community (often in the form of parents) responds, 86</page><page sequence="11">Commentary on Margolis Paper "Mental States" teaching the kinds of talk with which we are all familiar. Such being the case, verbal reports of "mental events" would be more like parallel behaviors shaped by the reinforcing contingencies of one's verbal community than reports of inner events. Consider, for example, the case where the behavior of a child is awkward or ineffective. The parent may ask the child what was wanted, desired, or intended. When the child's behavior is effective it may provide an occasion for an intentionalistic description in the child's presence, or perhaps offered to a third party: "He wanted a cookie, and got it for himself." The child's behavior becomes an occasion for his or her own publically learned self descriptions, attributions and explanations. That is to say, one's usage of terms for "mental states" in the first person is initially connected with those public events upon which the common usage of language must be based. When one engages in normal, socially learned, self descriptive talk with its complement of mental terms, it must be remembered that an immense amount of exposure to language learning contexts precedes any given instance. The situation, as complex as it might be, is not one which forces upon us any notion of causal intentional mental states of the sort presumed primitive by Margolis. Skinner has gone into considerable detail in describing examples of contingent relations between public and private events which provide learning contexts for words that are eventually occasioned by the private events themselves (see, e.g., 1957, pp. 130-135 for a particularly tight discussion). He concludes, however, that the ways in which the verbal community has circumvented "the inaccessibility of private stimuli in setting up related verbal behavior under their control [in no way] guarantees the precision of control seen in responses to external manipulable stimuli. . . . The contingencies which establish verbal behavior under the control of private stimuli are therefore defective. . . . [The] characteristic result of these defective contingencies is that such responses are often controlled by a mixture of stimuli the nature of which is not clear either to the community or listener or to the speaker himself" (pp. 133-135). Although one's ability to relate verbal behavior consistently or precisely to one's own private sensations or events is limited, the fact that normal mental event talk is sensible and useful indicates that important aspects of the situations which occasion such talk are, or have been, public. The utility of the common mental or intentional accounts of human activity derive from a generally consistent correspondence between such accounts and increased probabilities of occurrence of the activities which they specify. Day (1976) has provided a behavioristic philosophical analysis of intentional accounts which details ways in which our talk about "intentions" is useful in the sense of alerting others to imminent activity to which they may then respond more readily and effectively. His assessment suggests a clarification of the relationship between talk about intentions as mental states and intentionality as an observable characteristic of behavioral episodes themselves. It is Day's judgment that intentions, when they can be taken as discriminable inner conditions, play a minor role in the control of our self-ascriptions of intentions (and no causal role in behavior whatsoever). Rather, the presence and persistence of such intentional accounts and references owes a great debt to environmental contingencies of reinforcement which generate behavioral episodes, controlled by environmental events, which exhibit both the temporally extended and event directed character supporting the current intentional and teleological descriptive idioms. 87</page><page sequence="12">Brian Lahren The Intentionality of Behavior In order to develop more clearly the relationship between the mental or intentional features of an inherently public language and the intentionality of behavioral episodes to which such features are related, it is useful to present an outline of a Skinnerian analysis of behavioral intentionality. Such an analysis offers a parallel to Dennet's "natural selection" interpretation of neural structures but does not exhibit the latter's mentalism with respect to intentions and behavioral intentionality. In Content and Consciousness Dennet failed to offer a convincing extension of the natural selection of neural structures to the realities of behavioral episodes which present instances of purposiveness or intentionality. He correctly saw the task of materialist explanations to be the avoidance of the intentionalist's dilemma of getting "from matter and motion to content and purpose, and back again" (p. 41). He also noted a connection between the intentionalist's presumption of the environmental appropriateness of antecedent-consequent connectives and natural selection's guarantee, over the long run, of the environmental appropriateness of what it produces. Unfortunately, he mis construed an important potential solution to his problem of extending a selection-like non-teleological explanation to on-going behavior. Dennet apparently misunderstands Skinner's fundamental concept of "op?rant" behavior. I present Dennet's discussion in its entirety so that it can be clearly contrasted with the contribution to an understanding of intentional terms and behavioral intentionality which Skinner's work actually provides. . . . The meaningless babbling of an infant and its apparently random limb movements are examples of op?rant behavior, and Skinner holds that somehow op?rant behavior can be refined and connected to a stimulus cue. Thus the child learns to speak and walk. Skinner's problem is how to make the afferent stimulus cues jump the gap to the efferent side and select the appropriate 'emissions.' If instead of supposing with Skinner that the apparently random op?rant behavior is in fact randomly emitted by the efferent side, we suppose that it is stimulated ? entirely inappropriately ? by the as yet unstructured and unanalysed afferent barrage, the problem is no longer how the aff?rents get to their appropriate efferents, but how the appropriate interconnections among the many inappro priate ones get weeded out for survival. What is needed is some intra-cerebral function to take over the evolutionary role played by the exigencies of nature in species evolution: i.e., some force to extinguish the inappropriate. ... In inherited pre-wiring we have the basis for such capacities, but in order to explain how this might work we must delve deeper into the physiology of the nervous system, (p. 52) Two major misunderstandings are present in Dennet's references to op?rant be havior. One is the reference to op?rant behavior as "random." The other is in the claim that in order to explain how afferent-efferent connections are made "we must delve deeper into the physiology of the nervous system." We will first consider op?rant behavior and the opportunity it holds for shaping an understanding of behavioral intentionality. Then we will return to Dennet's second point. Dennet's view that the term "op?rant" refers only to the random emission of behavior is in error. The error is one of omission and involves a failure to engage the most 88</page><page sequence="13">Commentary on Margolis Paper "Mental States' fundamental aspect of the op?rant concept ? the observable effect of certain kinds of consequences upon behaviors. The discovery and clarification of the behavior-conse quence relationships which define the general class of op?rant behaviors involves a wide variety of consequential events which can be regarded as crucial to the survival of the individual and the species. In the introduction to the topic of op?rant conditioning in his most recent book, Skinner (1974) has this to say about consequences: Many things in the environment, such as food and water, sexual contact, and escape from harm, are crucial for the survival of the individual and the species, and any behavior which produces them therefore has survival value. Through the process of op?rant conditioning, behavior having this kind of consequence becomes more likely to occur, (p. 39) It is simply fact that behavioral episodes having these kinds of consequences are more likely to occur in similar future situations. In such cases the behavior is said to be strengthened or selected by its consequences. The consequences are termed "reinforc ers," due to their effects upon the behavior which produced them. In addition to the effect produced by reinforcing consequences, most op?rant behaviors acquire important connections with the surrounding environment. The reinforcement achieved in adapting to a given environment requires the sort of physical contact which Skinner calls ' ' stimula tion." When contact with a given reinforcing consequence occurs in the presence of other prominent public or private physical stimuli, the stimuli are said to acquire discriminative control over the reinforced response. Discriminative control does not force or cause a response to occur. The term control is used when talking about op?rant behavior to refer to the fact that when discriminative stimuli are present the response previously reinforced in their presence is more likely to occur. According to Skinner, "environmental control has an obvious biological significance. If all behavior were equally likely to occur on all occasions, the result would be chaotic. It is obviously advantageous that a response occur when it is likely to be reinforced" (1953, p. 108). Op?rant behavior, as normally discussed, involves the identification of three charac teristic features: stimulation, a response, and a reinforcing consequence. The ways in which the events comprising op?rant relationships are related to one another are called contingencies of reinforcement. This three term pattern of reinforcing contingencies produces a wide variety of op?rant behaviors under discriminative control. Direct contact with the environment, contact with other people non-verbally, and responding in accord with the reinforcing practices of one's verbal community (sometimes in the presence of one's own private stimulations) provide behavioral examples fitting this three term contingency. The important role which discriminative responding can be seen to play in illuminating the nature of human linguistic practices, and in particular, the talk of intentions, wants, desires, and so forth will be taken up shortly. Skinner has called the class of op?rant behaviors "the very field of purpose and intention" (1974, p. 55), and the processes identified in their generation provide the possibility of a coherent non-teleological account of behavioral intentionality. (Re member that the teleological character of the behavior of humans and sentient creatures was among Margolis' criteria for the appropriate ascription of those mental states said to be responsible for such teleological behavioral characteristics.) Reinforcement, as a class of effects identifiable in most human and animal behavior, is characterizable as a subtle, 89</page><page sequence="14">Brian Lahren though forceful, process of selection (see, e.g., Scriven, 1959, for a careful discussion of the causal implications of natural selection processes). The parallel with natural selection is explicitly drawn by Skinner. ... As accidental traits, arising from mutations, are selected by their contribu tion to survival, so accidental variations in behavior are selected by their reinforcing consequences. (1974, p. 114) The [reinforcement] process supplements natural selection. Important con sequences of behavior which could not play a role in evolution because they were not sufficiently stable features of the environment are made effective through op?rant conditioning during the lifetime of the individual, whose power in dealing with the world is thus vastly increased. (1974, p. 46) When we see people or animals behaving, it is usually the case that they produce a temporal succession of behaviors which are met by any of a wide range of consequences, many of which are potentially identifiable as reinforcers. This relatedness of strings of activity to some terminal state of affairs is what makes explanations of teleological form seem most appropriate. Indeed, the account of our behavior which is implicit in ordinary speech is, as Taylor (1964) and Margolis clearly recognize, teleological. However, since the effect of a reinforcing consequence is to "select' ' behaviors occurring in time, which, however accidently, produced the reinforcing consequence, the behavioral episode selected will be seen as directed toward that consequence in the future. The ordered temporality of a behavioral episode is among the features of that event selected by a reinforcing consequence. According to Skinner: . . . The contingencies of survival [the processes of natural selection] could not generate a process of conditioning which took into account how behavior produced its consequences. The only useful relation was temporal: a process could evolve in which a reinforcer strengthened any behavior it followed. (1971, p. 120) Margolis, and intentionalists generally, presume that the directedness of higher animal and human activity has an explanation in the unique causal nature of intentional mental processes. Despite the appealing uniqueness and established historical acceptabil ity of intentional mental processes, Skinner considers it to be timely to turn our attention away from traditional formulations and focus upon the natural processes of selection which can be seen to generate temporally directed behavioral episodes. The analysis of op?rant behaviors clearly reveals the selective action of consequences as a kind of causality, albeit a causality which differs from the mechanistic variety we normally associate with physical events. The discovery of op?rant behavioral processes, and in particular the selecting effects of reinforcement, provides a means of freeing the natural purposiveness of behavioral episodes from the paradoxes associated with traditional, mentalistic, purposive or teleological accounts. A similar fate has already befallen those classical purposive accounts which pervaded discussion of the origin of speciation prior to the formalization of Darwinian natural selection (Beckner, 1967). Contrary to the intentionalists' presumption of causal conscious processes belonging to the essence of personhood, op?rant analysis reveals processes of reinforcement which place the determination of a person's behavior (and consciousness) in the environment (or in the history of the individual's contact with the environment). It does not demand 90</page><page sequence="15">Commentary on Margolis Paper "Mental States" that we abandon the concept of persons or personhood as a basic particular of human experience (e.g., Strawson, 1959); rather, it provides a means of examining the genesis and nature of human behavior, including the ways in which the making of ascriptions to ourselves and others can be seen as instances of human discriminative responding. Any immediate sensate features of our experiences, as well as the observed directedness of behavioral episodes, can be examined in the light of an individual's contact with environmental contingencies of reinforcement. Evidence assumed to be supportive of intentionalist theses can be re-examined, as in the case where the occasional prominence in our experience of certain private events or states and their temporal relation to concurrent or imminent op?rant behavior seems to validate the view of antecedently effective psychological processes. Verbal reports of occurrent sensations do indeed seem to offer possible antecedent causes of the subsequent overt behaviors which they accompany. Their temporal relationship to other behavior is characteristically focused upon by a linguistic community familiar with a similar causal pattern in physical events and which has focused upon such events in its conventional explanations. Yet the practices of our linguistic community were well established long before the opportunity existed for reconceptualization in terms of the op?rant processes only discovered and described in this century. The historical basis of the prevailing explanatory practices is certainly understanda ble, especially in light of the fact that the effect of reinforcement upon subsequent behaviors only unfolds in environmentally equivalent, temporally separated occasions. What camouflages the effects of reinforcement is the temporal interval separating the reinforcing consequence from its behavioral effect. The connection between reinforce ment on one occasion and a manifest change in behavior at a later point in time does not provide the verbal community with a contingency to which it can respond as effortlessly as is possible with antecedent immediate sensations and overt behaviors. The op?rant account differs from the intentional-teleological one in showing how the temporal and event-oriented character of most human and animal behavior is the observable effect of reinforcing contingencies. Intentionalist explanations, which trade heavily on the temporality of behavior as well as on the features of an ordinary language replete with mental terms employed causally, can be given a plausible op?rant interpreta tion. This is to be accomplished by linking an op?rant analysis of behavioral intentional ity to a systematic examination of the contingencies of reinforcement operating as one learns to talk about one's own behavior and the behavior of others. An example of a behavioral interpretation of talk about intentions is offered in the following quotation from a recent paper by Willard Day. ... I have already argued that most of the time when we discuss our intentions no intentions are actually "there." For example, we generate talk about our intentions when our on-going behavior, guided by discriminative control and set up by reinforcement, is interrupted, often by an occasion for some explanation of what we are ?oing. In these situations an ontology of intentions is misplaced: instead, ontological interest should be brought to bear on the realities of the adaptive functioning of the intentional talk. However, the feelings or inner conditions which from time to time can set the occasion for talk of "feelings of intending to do something" are occurrent. This 91</page><page sequence="16">Brian Lahren means that they actually occur in us, and they are spoken of by behaviorists as part of the "private events" which, if responsed to discriminatively, constitute aspects of our consciousness. These feelings and inner conditions have the same ontological status as our experience of external stimulation: that is, we are conscious of our feelings in precisely the same way that we can be said to be conscious of the environment. In all cases what is involved is responding to stimulation: in one class stimulation arises in the environment, in the other within the skin. Just as we do not respond to all stimulation from the environment we do not respond to all stimulation arising from within the body. An important consideration is that in order for us to be able to be conscious of anything, differential reinforcement must be associated with the responding involved. . . . The feelings that control our talk when we say we have feelings of intention are not dispositional in nature. Interest in behavioral dispositions is connected entirely with the effects of reinforcement, or with the inherent intentionality of behavior, if you will. (1976, pp. 121-122) It should be apparent at this point that the identification of op?rant behaviors and ascriptions of mental-intentional predicates to persons or sentient creatures, either in the first or third person, are both to be taken as ways in which the verbal repertoires of human beings are discriminatively controlled by properties of public and private on-going behavior. Behaviorism and Physiological Accounts With respect to the place of physiological accounts in explanations of on-going behavior, both Margolis and Skinner are seemingly in agreement. Skinner does not argue for particular physiological interpretations of behavioral processes nor against the impor tance of an increasingly precise understanding of physiological processes. Rather, he argues against the kind of speculative physiologizing in which Dennet engages in Content and Consciousness. Both he and Margolis agree that physiological accounts only provide alternatives to non-physiological descriptions of the behavioral facts. Whatever the physiological mechanisms correlated with behavior turn out to be, their identification will only encompass processes paralleling those aspects of behavior which man apprehends in absence of detailed physiological knowledge. To Skinner, in particu lar, it seems clear that relationships between behaviors and their contexts of occurrence can be given descriptive clarification and explanation involving no present need for speculative physiologizing. It is rather that the development of an adequate physiology of behavior may depend upon an accurate functional account of behavioral phenomena. The identification of op?rant processes in behavior-environment relations, is part of the needed descriptive phenomenology. In About Behaviorism, Skinner commented about this issue in the following way: . . . The physiologist of the future will tell us all that can be known about what is happening inside the behaving organism. His account will be an important advance over a behavioral analysis, because the latter is necessarily ' 'historical' ' ? that is to say, it is confined to functional relations showing temporal gaps. Something is done today which affects the behavior of an organism tomorrow. 92</page><page sequence="17">Commentary on Margolis' Paper "Mental States" No matter how clearly that fact can be established, a step is missing, and we must wait for the physiologist to supply it. He will be able to show how an organism is changed with exposed to contingencies of reinforcement and why the changed organism then behaves in a different way, possibly at a much later date. What he discovers cannot invalidate the laws of a science of behavior, but it will make the picture of human action more nearly complete. (1974, p. 215) At this point it remains to take note of the sense in which the ontological status of behavioral events, however complex, is construed by behaviorists. It must be remem bered that the very notion of "the physical" and hence much of what has inspired ontological debate, per se, would make little sense were it not for the fact that, historically, complex human behaviors have been accounted for by positing special "non-physical" events or processes as explanations. A history of explanatory practice stretching back 2400 years seems to support the appropriateness of special processes involved in human action. However, the contemporary behaviorist has at his or her disposal a means for disarming some of the current conflict over ontology and mental events. Whenever ontological discussions are engaged regarding human behavior, the behaviorist should be quick to point out that the evidence for both the "mental" and the "physical" depends upon the exercise of human discriminative capacities. Thus, al though mental and physical terms and their attribution to humans may be engaged differently in different verbal communities, or differently with respect to differing events in the same community, the behavioral processes involved in such discriminative responding provides no basis for a dualistic ontology at the level of events which stand in a controlling relation to such discriminative responding. The upshot of this for be haviorists is the conclusion that references to dualism do not actually relate to substantive ontological issues, but rather they discriminate differences in linguistic explanatory practices typical of separate language communities or separable practices in one com munity. The dualism is linguistic in nature, not a dualism of events or properties. What then are we to make of Margolis' claim that the identification of special features of the ascription of mental predicates to persons weighs on the issue of the extent to which materialist characterizations (involving only physical events or physical processes) are inappropriate for persons? In a paper recently published in Behaviorism, G.E. Zuriff (1975) discussed what he took to be necessary for clarification of the relationship between descriptions offered by verbal communities employing agency and action concepts and those employing op?rant behavioral concepts. While I do not agree with Zuriff that it is necessary to view the property of being an action as "an enormously complex multidimensional property of a response and its behavioral context" (p. 17) ? this appears to confuse what is obviously a commonly made discrimination with the potential complexities of its many possible descriptions ? he is certainly making sense when he says: . . . there is one system "programmed" to identify actions given a physical input from a response and its behavioral context. This system is the nervous system of an adult human member of a language community. . . . Thus, the conceptual gap between response and action is mediated by a human observer, (p. 18) 93</page><page sequence="18">Brian Lahren The interesting and important point is that a clarification of the relationship between intentional and behavioral characterizations rests upon an examination of the history and circumstances surrounding a human observer who engages one or both sets of descrip tions. Both intentional and behavioral characterizations of a behavioral event involving a person employ "concepts" in the sense that each concept is a response to selected properties of an event or situation. For each, the case is such that for the concepts employed in description the referents are those properties upon which the reinforcements of one's verbal community have been contingent and which therefore control the response. Although different verbal communities may nurture control of a discriminative response by respecting somewhat different properties of a given situation, the pattern of the functional relations constituting the discriminated response remains the same. De spite differences in the concepts employed, both intentional and behavioral accounts are instances of human capacities to respond discriminatively to aspects of either one's own behavior or the behavior of others. Conclusion The basic processes revealed in the analysis of op?rant behaviors provide a non dualistic account of the intentional or teleological character of behavioral episodes and a way of understanding the differences between intentional and behavioral accounts of complex human functioning. With discriminative responding as the basis for both behavioral and intentional accounts, the problem of comparing one characterization with the other need not involve a logical and hence structural analysis, nor the implication that one account favors materialist and the other non-materialist ontologies. What is needed is a functional analysis of the controlling events which occasion each type of verbal characterization. Such an analysis would concentrate on responses which reflect histories of exposure to the discriminative practices generated in the reinforcing contingencies to which an observer has been exposed. Clearly such an analysis is an empirical matter, and one which is beyond the scope of this paper. references Anscombe, G.E.M. Intention (2nd ed.). Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1966.
