<plain_text><page sequence="1">HESIOD AND EMPEDOCLES Teacher of most men is Hesiod: they are sure that he knows many things, who did not recognize day and night: for they are one. T HUS HERACLITUS CRITICIZED Hesiod, and almost two centuries later testified to his influence on subsequent generations. Whether he was thinking of the common men rather than of the leading thinkers and poets of his day is not clear. But in any case, this quotation, together with the other references of Heraclitus and Xen- ophanes to Hesiod, suggests the latter's continuing importance in the development of Greek literature and thought.1 As Solm- sen and others have observed, Hesiod's influence is by no means confined to epic, lyric, and elegiac poets, but extends also to philosophers such as Parmenides and Em- pedocles.2 Since they wrote in hexametric verse, the distinction between poet and philosopher is, of course, an artificial one. Both drew from the main poetic tradition of Homer and Hesiod, though the extent of their borrowings and the impact of this tradition on their thought remain to some degree undetermined. In the case of Em- pedocles in particular, scholars of the Pre- socratics such as W. K. C. Guthrie and W. Jaeger, have discussed points of comparison between his poems and those of Hesiod, mainly in connection with the doctrine of Love and Strife and the teachings of his religious work the Purifications (Kathar- moi).3 Other scholars such as W. Kranz and A. Traglia have noted formal and sty- listic similarities between the compositions of the two poetic thinkers.4 A survey of the work of these scholars suggests that the influence of Hesiod on Empedocles is far more extensive than their individual studies and observations indicate. Hence, the aim of the present study is to draw together and supplement previous scholarly research in order to determine, if possible, the full extent of the relationship between Hesiod and Empedocles. An obvious danger of such a study is that it can become a mere 1 In addition to B57 of the fragments of Hera- clitus' work, see B40 and B106; for Xenophanes, B11.

HERSHBELL Flickwerk with little or no originality. In order to avoid this, the following schema will be observed: (a) consideration of sty- listic and verbal similarities; (b) compari- son of major themes or pivotal concepts, e.g., in the case of Empedocles his doctrines of Love and Strife and the "roots of all things"; and (c) subsidiary themes, e.g., the degeneration of mankind and natural law, apparently common to both. To some extent these categories overlap, and verbal and stylistic considerations cannot always be divorced from those more obviously philosophical. The overall purpose of this study, apart from showing the extent of Hesiodic influ- ence, is to offset those interpretations of Empedocles which begin with later think- ers, notably Aristotle, and work backwards. Of course, were it not for Aristotle's preser- vation of some ipsissima verba of Empedo- cles, our knowledge of his work would be much less. It must constantly be kept in mind, however, that Aristotle brought to his interpretation of Empedocles a terminology and concepts in some cases quite alien to the poet of Akragas. For example, although Empedocles' doctrine of the four "roots" of things no doubt anticipates Aristotle's the- ory of the four elements (stoicheia), it is anachronistic and misleading to identify the two; for Aristotle the real elements of the physical world are not earth, air, fire and water, as they were for Empedocles, but the primary opposites: hot, cold, wet, and dry. A consideration of Hesiodic influence is, of course, in no way designed to minimize the originality of Empedocles' thought or his own impact on following generations. H. Diels, who regarded Empedocles' system as "ein interessanter Ekleticismus," found in it "wenig originellen Gehalte."" But such a judgment seems harsh, especially when it is remembered that Parmenides' poem, de- spite the apparent novelty of his thesis, also contains reminiscences of the work of his predecessors, including the poetic tradi- tion of Homer and Hesiod.6 No doubt this tradition was in the cultural atmosphere of ancient Greece, and Wilamowitz's inciden- tal remark that Empedocles knew nothing of eastern Greek poetry except Homer and Hesiod, may well be correct.7 Given the assumption, however, that the epic tradi- tion had a pervasive and deep-rooted influ- ence on the culture of Empedocles' time, and that he drew from it in developing his own poetical thought, it does not follow that he was merely an imitator or thinker with little or no originality. What must be kept in mind is the extent and manner in which he reshaped or further developed the tradition, and even reacted against it. In view of Xenophanes' and Heraclitus' ex- plicit criticisms of Homer and Hesiod and the implicit attack of Parmenides on the thought processes represented by the latter, it would be surprising if Empedocles' en- deavors were wholly without critical or polemical intent.8 It is by no means uncom- mon for a thinker to be both indebted to and critical of his predecessors. The problem of determining the influ- ence of Hesiod on Empedocles is, of course, somewhat complicated in two respects. First, it is not always certain which lines or part lines in the two undoubtedly genuine poems of Hesiod, the Theogony and Works and days, are original and not composed or inserted by later rhapsodes. Similarly, not all the fragments of Empedocles' poems have been considered genuine or are free of textual problems. Second, given the simi- , H.

He could have derived his knowledge of Hesiod from another source, e.g., an itinerant rhapsode. Another possibility is that Hesiod and later, Empedocles, were dependent on another source from which they drew some of their material, e.g., Orphism.9 Though doubts such as the latter cannot perhaps be dispelled entirely, a considera- tion of verbal and stylistic similarities will make it at least probable that Empedocles had direct acquaintance with Hesiod's works, and that the echoes of these in the fragments of his own poems are not wholly accidental. As for the matter of authentic- ity, there is no unanimity among scholars of Hesiod as to which lines or passages were original to his poems. According to Jacoby, more than half of the Theogony is spurious, and Wilamowitz refused to print the last sixty-four lines of the Works and days (they constitute that part usually known as the Days).1? In the case of Empedocles, it has recently been argued that B111 (a fragment of nine lines) is spurious.11 In general, however, extreme sceptical posi- tions such as these have not been favorably received by other scholars, and for the pur- poses of this study it will be assumed, unless there is good evidence to the contrary, that the passages of Hesiod and Empedocles under consideration are genuine. As a rule, textual problems, unless significant to the argument, will be confined to footnotes. I. Stylistic and Verbal Similarities Since Sturz's collection and study of the fragments of Empedocles, Empedocles Ag- rigentinus (1805), all editors have consid- ered the dedicatory verse to Pausanias: IIavavt`L, TV 8, KXVOtL, &amp;a'itpovos "'AYXrTEo ViE ("But do you listen, O son of skilled An- chises") as the first fragment of Empedo- cles' poem On nature. This is not to say that it was, in fact, the very beginning of the poem, since the particle 8E suggests that one or more lines preceded it. But the for- mula o-u 8v (see also a; 8,'o0v of B2.8, or V' of B110.6 and acr y' of B3.6) although found in Homer, occurs with frequency in Hesiod's Works and days (v. 27, 213, 248, 274, etc.) where together with the similar formulae o- 8E, ,'lEs 8, AXXa oS, it is usu- ally used to introduce a new set of ideas or moral teachings. Moreover, it has the func- tion of holding together the often discon- nected parts of the poem and, especially after long digressions, of uniting them to the main thread of the discourse. Because 9 In his commentary on Hesiod's Theogony, M. L. West claims that it is unlikely that Orphism yet existed at the time of Hesiod. See Hesiod The- ogony, ed. M. L. West (Oxford 1966), p. 282. Orphic influence has often been seen on Empedo- cles, but this has been questioned by Millerd. C. E. Millerd, On the interpretation of Empedocles (Chicago 1908), p. 10-11. The whole problem of Orphism in antiquity is quite complicated and speculative. In general, the negative conclusions of I. M. Linforth in his The arts of Orpheus (Berke- ley 1941) are persuasive. There is also no over- whelming evidence of Pythagorean influence. B129 has often been taken as a reference to Pythagoras himself, but Jaeger points out that "we can hardly consider the reference to Pythag- oras well established." Jaeger, Theology, p. 151. 1o West refers to F. Jacoby's Hesiodi Theogonia (Berlin 1930) as a "cross between Aristarchus and a railway timetable"; West, Theogony, p. 102. Concerning possible interpolations in the The- ogony West writes: "The clearest signs of remanie- ment are, in my opinion, in the description of the underworld, 720-819. ... But in general, unsub- stantiated suspicion is all that one has to go on." West, Theogony, p. 50. Solmsen is inclined to accept the genuineness of the underworld passage. See Solmsen, Hesiod, p. 60 f. No argument in this paper depends on whether the Days is genuine. 11 See B. A. Van Groningen, "Le fragment 111 d'Empedocle," Classica et mediaevalia 17 (1956) 47-61. According to him the fragment is not genuine but "l'exageration de ce qu'on savait d'Empedocle dans les milieux plus ou moins culti- ves, la cristallisation de ce que racontait le grand public, mal informe et avide de merveilleux . ." (p. 68). His arguments have a degree of persua- siveness, but no part of this study depends on the genuineness of B111.</page><page sequence="4">148 JACKSON P. HERSHBELL of its occurrence in the first fragment of On nature, some scholars have suggested that a proem or introduction similar to that of Works and days also appeared in Empedo- cles' poem.12 In any case, the remains of the latter begin with an expression charac- teristic of Hesiod. The similarity between Hesiod's poems and those of Empedocles does not end, however, with the use of a common formula. Like Hesiod, Empedocles calls on the Muses (B3 and B131), but in neither case are their compositions exclusively the revela- tions of higher powers who possess and dominate the emotions and thoughts of the poets. On the contrary, their personalities are expressed, and even some autobiograph- ical material is contained in the verses of their poems. In the Theogony Hesiod men- tions himself by name (v. 22) and describes the appearance of the Muses to him while he was tending sheep under Mount Helicon; in the Works and days he frequently refers to the facts of his life, including how he visited Chalcis in Euboea and won a prize at the funeral games there (651-662). So in the first fragment of the Purifications (B 112), Empedocles describes his itinerant life, and the honor he received from crowds desiring to hear his oracles and words of healing. Both poets direct their teaching to a specific individual: in the Works and days Hesiod advises his brother, Perses, and in On nature Empedocles instructs his friend, Pausanias. In fact, both poets use the same term at the beginning of their address: KUXIJO ("listen" or "pay heed," W. d. 9 and B 1). For Hesiod the verb does not necessarily mean "hear" or "listen" but "pay heed" whether with eye or ear. In a similar fashion, Empedocles does not put a premium on any one of the senses, but seems to consider them all as being "paths to knowledge" (B3, 12). In general, as Kranz and Guthrie have observed, Empedocles' address to a single person in On nature puts it in the category of admonitory poetry (it is a Mahngedicht, according to Kranz) of which the Works and days is the most famous example.13 But in this work Hesiod's rede is not always confined to Perses; on occasion he addresses the judges or rulers of the land (e.g., 202 f. and 248 f.), and in the Theogony an un- specified general audience. So in the frag- ments assigned to the Purifications, Em- pedocles addresses his fellow citizens in Akragas, and perhaps in both poems he has mankind as a whole in mind. Moreover, both poets working under some kind of divine inspiration seem to have occasional contempt for their fellow men. In the Theogony Hesiod's Muses abuse him and his fellow shepherds as being "rustic or boorish . . . wretched things of shame" (v. 26), and in the Works and days, this present race of men is of iron, and, in part, violent and evil, subject to death (175 f.). The judges of the land are "bribe-devour- ing" (v. 39) and Hesiod holds them in contempt for not knowing proverbs such as "the half is greater than the whole" (v. 40). They are, in fact, "fools" (v?7rtLOL). So are those men, according to Empedocles, whose "thoughts are not far-reaching" (B 11) and assume the existence of what is not; men are doomed to swift destruction, boastful of having found the Whole (B2); indeed, they suffer from madness (pjavia, B3.1); do not speak rightly (B9); and are murdering and feasting on one another (B136). On the whole, neither poet seems to have a very flattering view of the human race. Yet another similarity is found in the claim that Hesiod and Empedocles make to the effect that their words are true and without deception. In the Theogony, im- mediately after castigating Hesiod's fellow men, the Muses declare: "We know how to speak many false things as though they were true: but we know when we wish to utter true things" (27-28). Their speech 12 Kranz, Neue Jahrbiicher 27, 78. 13 Guthrie, History, II, p. 137 and Kranz, Neue Jahrbiicher, 78.</page><page sequence="5">HESIOD AND EMPEDOCLES 149 suggests that Hesiod has previously been occupied with false matters, or even that the tales of other rhapsodes were not true. Again in the Works and days, Hesiod de- clares flatly to his brother: ErT)Irvula /vOqrlcal- /v (v. 10). So in Empedocles the claim of truth is made in B114: "I know that truth is present in the words which I shall speak" (... . o01a fv oivcK X~O'q apa pvOots . . .). Also in B17.26 Empedocles declares, "but do you listen to the unerring course of my argument" (oU '8'Kovc EXdyov OdoXOV OVK a7Tra?TqdXOv) words often taken as a deliberate imitation of Parmenides' ". . . listening to the deceptive order of my words" (. KdOU"IOV i)wV c7r.WV 77raTqXoV aKOVWV B8.51). Empedocles says he will teach the truth, whereas Parmenides avowedly puts forth false teaching. But there seems to be little doubt that the prototype for both of these passages is the address of the Muses to Hesiod in verses 27-28 of the Theogony.14 Like Hesiod, and against Parmenides, Em- pedocles is anxious, though his reasons are not wholly clear, to claim truth for his poems. The foregoing similarities of thought and vocabulary might, of course, be wholly acci- dental were it not for other verbal echoes of Hesiod's poetry in the fragments of Emped- ocles' works, which will now be examined. In many instances the phrases used by Em- pedocles are given new meaning or other- wise reworked, but the borrowing seems clearly present. In B54, for example, Empedocles de- clares that air "sank down into the earth with long roots" (ptaKpiLrL KTa~ X Va TO70 putats). So in Works and days (v. 19) Hesiod had described how Cronos who dwells in the aether, set Eris in the roots of the earth (yarlP iv Aiga~). Again in Theog. 728, as Traglia following Diels noted, "the roots of the earth (yq9s k1aL) and the sea yielding no harvest" grew above Tartarus.15 Since a context is lacking for the verse of Empedocles, it is impossible to understand the expression fully, but that it is not an allusion to Xenophanes' doctrine is demon- strated by B39 where the latter's view that the roots of the earth extend indefinitely (see Xenophanes' B28) seems to be com- batted. Further discussion of "roots" in Hesiod and Empedocles will be taken up in a consideration of their main concepts. In B82.2 the expression ir uTIaLapo^UL tLEXEcuLv is found in Theog. 152 and W. d. 149.16 Again when Empedocles describes the cosmic sphere during the reign of Love (B29) or his divinity of holy, ineffable will (B134) opposing the usual ancient Greek anthropomorphic conception of the gods, he says o . .. Ar . v'.roLO . . c. adcYovrat, using, in part, Hesiod's description of the giants in the Theogony from whose shoulders spring an hundred arms (d&amp;r' ~wv dlraovro, 150) and whose fifty heads are set on strong shoulders (irt' UTrflapotL tLuahfcLv, 152). It is, moreover, tempting to conclude that Em- pedocles' description of monstrous figures, (e.g., foreheads without necks, or creatures with innumerable hands, B57-B61), al- though the result of his own imaginative powers and representing stages of organic development in his cosmic cycle, was in- spired by Hesiod's description of the Cy- clops, Titans, and Giants in the Theogony. In B96.1 another apparent reminiscence of Hesiod's Theogony is found. The earth is ... iv EVTErpVOLt xodvotat, the phrase being partly an echo of the yala EVpv rVpvos3 of Theog. 117. Also the term x'avos, borrowed 14 The similarity of the Muses' message to Hesiod and the goddess' message to Parmenides has been noted by Jaeger, Theology, p. 94; Dolin, HSCP 66, 94. That B17, 26 of Empedocles' poem is an obvious echo of Parmenides' B8, 52 has been noted by Guthrie, History, II, 138. 15 Traglia, Studi, p. 31. Many of the following examples used in this part of the paper can also be found in Traglia. 16 G. S.

HERSHBELL from metal working and found in Homer,17 is used by Hesiod in a comparison in which the scorching of the earth by vapor and its melting by the heat of Zeus' thunderbolts during the Titanomachia is likened to the melting of tin in crucibles or to iron which is melted in the earth by fires in mountain dens. One cannot exclude the possibility that Empedocles' notion of fires burning beneath the surface of the earth (B52) was influenced by this passage in Hesiod. But perhaps the two most notable exam- ples of Hesiodic influence on Empedocles' language are found in two fragments of the Purifications: the description of the oracle of Necessity in B 115 and the catalogues of divinities in B122-123. In B115 Empedocles announces in a solemn manner an ". . . oracle of Necessity, an ancient decree of the gods, sealed with firm-based oaths. . . ." What follows sug- gests not only a strong Hesiodic influence on the general thought of the fragment, but also its language and style. According to the ancient decree of the gods "when a being through sinfulness defiles his own limbs with blood (murder) or following strife has sworn a false oath, even one of the spirits (8altovjs) who have been al- lotted great length of life, they should wan- der thrice 10,000 seasons away from the blessed... ." First, these verses remind one of Hesiod's Works and days, where there is a description of a golden race of men who after their death become "guiltless daimones . guardians of mortal men who watch over righteous decrees and savage deeds, wandering everywhere over the earth, clothed in mist" (W. d. 121-125).18 Sec- ond, if the verses of B 115 are compared with 793-806 of the Theogony, it becomes apparent how similar the thought of Em- pedocles is to that of Hesiod. In Theog. 793-806, the notion of exile from the com- pany of the gods occurs in connection with Hesiod's account of the river Styx, by whose frigid water the oaths of the gods are sworn. And in both cases there is banishment for oath-breaking (though in Empedocles' ac- count the primal sin seems to be shedding of blood; for Hesiod it is oath-breaking alone). Moreover, the attack on oath- breaking is stylistically similar: 03 KEV 7V iErlopKOV OTiE~oAd , oo'aood y (Theog. 793); and in Empedocles (B115.4): . . . '3 K(E) iErKopKOV 4aprVjTas TroodTcrcr. The latter line is considered by Knatz and later Wilamo- witz to be an addition from the Theogony, and not original to B 115 of Empedocles' poem.19 But their arguments are not de- cisive, and that Empedocles probably had the passage from Hesiod in mind is shown by comparison of v. 800 of the Theogony: aXhos y'E E X Taov XeTa XaE ArdrEpos aEOXos with v. 12 of B115: ahXog 8' i~ ahhov xxera, vovylov, s 7rarCTES, and by the use of ~'yv'yos ("primeval") in Theog. 806, which is found in another fragment of Em- pedocles (B84.7). In Hesiod it describes the water of Styx; in Empedocles the ele- mental fire within the human eye, which incidentally also contains water. Since the epithet is rare and not found in the Homeric poems, there is likelihood that it is taken from Hesiod's Theogony. But there is a difference between the con- ceptions of Hesiod and Empedocles in these passages, and that is, for Hesiod the exiled god remains a god; he is set apart from the human race, and the gap separating him from mortals remains the same in exile. For Empedocles the exiled daimon falls from his noble estate, and goes from one mortal form to another (". . . becoming in time all sorts of perishable things, taking in exchange difficult paths of life in succes- sion," B115.7-8), though it is not wholly clear whether the identity of the daimon is 17 On Empedocles' use of terms borrowed from various crafts, see F.

Yet another fragment of Empedocles showing the influence of Hesiod is B122- 123: There were the Earth goddess (Chthonie) and the keen-sighted Sun goddess (Heliope), and bloody Strife and Harmony sedate of look, Beauty and Ugliness, Speed and Loitering, charming Truth, and dark-haired Obscurity. Growth and Decay, Sleeping and Waking, Movement and Rest, many-crowned Pomp and Defilement, Silence and Speech. Though there is only one name the same, i.e., N-qAEp-rq, Truth or Infallibility, the primary model for these fragments of Em- pedocles' poem is probably the Catalogue of Nymphs found in II. 18.39 f.20 It is not an unimaginative imitation of Homer, but shows originality and skill in invention. The fragments, however, are not without dis- tinct echoes of Hesiod's Theogony. In fact, the Stoic philosopher Cornutus (1st cent. A.D.), who saw in these fragments Empedo- cles' recognition of the differences or antin- omies of nature (Staoopa' r6rv 'vrwv, com- pared the variety of these names with those of the Titans in Hesiod's Theogony.21 Thus in both poets he saw the symbolic expres- sion of the contrariety and diversity of the forces which govern this world. But as Traglia pointed out, the analogy between the divinities of Empedocles and the Titans of Hesiod is vague and reflects, in general, the Stoic training of Cornutus.22 A more accurate comparison between these frag- ments of Empedocles and Hesiod's The- ogony is found in the Catalogue of the Nereids (240-264) and of the Oceanids (337-370), especially in the use of proper names with endings in -4: lHlEhO, IlpvUv41, Zcvd,, MEvr6O4, etc. (Theog. 349-361) and Kahhkatr4, PVaCI, Ktv4, MEya/rrC (B 122- 123). Moreover, some of the names of Empedocles' divinities are those of Hesiod: thus the goddesses Nqp EprmT4 and ?o4owa of B122 can be compared with the Nereid NrltEtpr4' of Theog. 262 and with the Oceanid ?od of Theog. 354. Both poets also use the adjective pdrraaa, Hesiod ap- plying it to HIErpa0l (v. 357) and Empedo- cles to Nq7tkEprmq (B 122.4). Lastly, Emped- ocles' HoXvoTEr4avo . .. Mey/IrTO (B123.2) echoes E1-YTEavov o ...'AAXtyv8 of Theog. 255. Other similarities of style and language can be cited. For example, Bignone observed that the formula with which Hesiod dis- tinguished the different ages of men, acrhp '?rd Ka roAro (W. d. 156; cf. v. 140 and 120) corresponds to the formula with which Empedocles distinguished the different mo- ments of the cosmic cycle: B30.1; B59.1.23 In the Diels-Kranz commentary the phrase taro EavTrmO in B29.3 used of the cosmic sphere is compared with Theog. 126, where starry Heaven is considered equal to the Earth.24 In the Works and days (v. 277) occurs a formula: xOv p 1v Kc Oipcl KaL olovoZi we rlEvot3, which may be echoed in fragments assigned to Empedocles' poem On nature: B20.6-7, B21.11, and B23.7. Traglia saw the model of B132.1: &amp;ApXl ;03 Odtv rrparrt8wv iK TaaTro )Taoorov (from which is perhaps derived Vergil's "felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas") in Theog. 954: OX0Los, O iya cpyov iV aOavaTroLv avvooaaa val~a awr-avro.255 A similar sentiment is also found at the end of the Works and days (826-827): Trd.v Ev8al~jLv TE Ka ApoXLo0, g, ... ipyay AVa oC aO,0,aTOLO'V. In view of the preceding linguistic and stylistic similarities, there is a high degree of probability that Empedocles knew the works of Hesiod and borrowed from them. 20 J.

HERSHBELL There is, of course, a tendency, no doubt partly arising from metrical requirements, for Empedocles to alter or reshape Hesiodic formulae. But Empedocles' borrowing from Hesiod is not confined to language and style; it extends also to his conceptual scheme, and similarities between some of the pivotal concepts of Hesiod and Emped- ocles will now be considered. II. The Cosmologies of Hesiod and Empedocles Although Hesiod in his Theogony mus- ters an enormous catalogue of divine powers or gods in the order of their generation with the unmistakable purpose of identifying the birth and subsequent reign of Zeus as the climax of cosmic history, the poem is not without cosmological intent. In v. 108-111, for example, the Muses are invoked to tell "how at first gods and earth came to be and rivers and the boundless sea . . . and the shining stars and the wide heaven above, and the gods who were born from them...." In subsequent sections of the poem cosmo- logical emphases are present. For example, as Solmsen has observed, when Hesiod speaks of Gaea's giving birth to Uranos, he is actually thinking of heaven and earth, Gaea herself being both the earth and the goddess representing the earth.26 More- over, although she is a goddess and mother, she is also a cosmic principle. From her are born heaven and the mountains and the sea, without a male consort, and she remains active in the background during the events leading to Zeus' final victory. In the The- ogony no origin is given for the human race, but in the Works and days (v. 108) Earth is said to be the common source of men and gods (%Ode v yEydacmLL; compare with the aXXoOhv Ov-qrw^v of B23.9-10).27 Especially in the description of the underworld following the Titanomachia (Theog. 720-819), there is emphasis on a cosmological description of the world. For example, the water of Styx, who was known earlier as the daughter of Ocean (v. 361 and 776), is now described as being a tenth part of the ocean (v. 789). Tartarus itself is a great gap which contains the "roots of earth and sea" (v. 728); later in v. 738 and 809 are mentioned the "springs and bor- ders" (wr~ya- Ka' wrlpara) of earth, sea, heaven, and even Tartarus. Owing to its possible influence on Em- pedocles' thought, Hesiod's description of the underworld bears closer examination. After the poet concludes with the banish- ment of the Titans to Tartarus, in 720-819 he envisions a three-storey universe which seems to be symmetrical. Heaven is at the "top," and, according to Hesiod, it would take a falling anvil nine nights and days to reach the earth on the tenth; from earth to Tartarus which lies on the "bottom," it would take another nine days and nights. Earth would then lie in the center of the cosmos, and on either side there would be two equal distances (compare this with the doxographical reports of Empedocles' sperical cosmos with its halves being hemi- spheres, earth lying in the center).28 Tar- tarus itself is enclosed by a high fence of bronze, and some way above this are the "roots of the earth self-grown (/reov'aa), and of the unharvested sea" (v. 728). Per- haps, as M. L. West points out, Hesiod envisioned the division between earth and sea as gradually disappearing in the under- world, the two branching out into roots intertwined with one another.29 Perhaps below this the distinction between earth and water disappears; or working in reverse from a basic indeterminate something, a tangle of determinate entities emerges 26Solmsen, Hesiod, p. 58. Solmsen's discussion of Hesiod's cosmology is especially valuable.

In 738 or, if this line be rejected, in 809 the "root" metaphor gives way to that of springs and sources (iriyal), the former metaphor perhaps being appro- priate only to the solid earth, whereas the notion of "sources" or "springs" is appro- priate to that of the ocean.30 Finally in 810-813, the poet tries to fuse the image of roots in space with the image of a palace hall and its threshold: There are the gleaming gates and the brazen threshold set immovable, compacted with roots that are continuous, self-grown.... Out at the end, away from all the gods, the Titans dwell across the misty gap. But the glorious allies of loud-crashing Zeus have their dwell- ing on Ocean's foundations. ... (810-815) Once more the term "roots" appears, prob- ably overlapping with the word "founda- tions" (0qdCO0oLt) applied to Ocean. Up to this point Hesiod has spoken of roots or sources of earth, sea, sky or heaven, and Tartarus; now to these is added the founda- tions of Ocean. Again in the Works and days the idea of "roots" appears (v. 18-19). Here the con-. trast is between Cronos "dwelling in the air" and the "roots of the earth." In the heaven or sky Eris ("Strife") has no func- tion; it busies itself only among men, and therefore has its dwelling in the depths of the earth. But that the term "roots" has no greater meaning than the depths of the earth, especially in view of its use in the Theogony, seems doubtful.31 In Hesiod's poems the term is on the way to having some kind of cosmological significance. Almost at the very beginning of Hesiod's account of the world's origin in the The- ogony, the poet introduces Eros (Love) as one of the oldest and fairest of the gods, coeval with Earth and Heaven (v. 120). And although Hesiod does not assign a spe- cific role to Eros in the processes of cosmic and divine generation, there is little doubt that the early appearance of the god in the poem (who is never mentioned again ex- cept in connection with Aphrodite's birth in v. 201) reflects Hesiod's recognition of the important function of sexual union in the origin of the cosmos and of the divine fam- ilies within it. In the remainder of the Theogony, the formulae describing sexual union are referred to Philotes and Aphro- dite, and it can be assumed that they take over the function of Eros. In 205-206, Aphrodite's activity in human life is de- scribed where she is present in the "whisper- ings of maidens and smiles and deceits... ." In other words, Eros is not only in the background of divine matings; she is also present in human activities. In addition to Eros or Love, Eris or Strife also appears in the Theogony (v. 225), later to have a major function in the Works and days. Although she is listed among the children of Night, Eris has, in turn, numerous offspring: ... painful Work and Forgetfulness and Hun- ger and tearful Sorrows, and Fightings, Bat- tles, Murders, Manslaughters, Quarrels, Lying Words, Disputes, Lawlessness and Bewilder- ment, all dwelling together with one another, and Oath who most troubles men on earth when anyone voluntarily swears a false oath. (226 f.) In Works and days, Hesiod opens his ad- dress to Perses with the doctrine of Strife or Eris, only now he gives the malicious god- dess of the Theogony a sister goddess who presides over the wholesome rivalry and competition of this world: So then, there was not one kind of Strife, but on the earth there are two. The one a man would praise when he recognized her; but the other is blameworthy .... For one fosters evil war and fighting, being cruel. .. . But the other is much better for men; she rouses even 30 Ibid., p. 364. 31 Wilamowitz saw no greater meaning in the verse: Erga, p. 43. But if one accepts the priority of the Theogony, the "roots of earth" in the Works and days probably has some reference to the cosmological passages of Hesiod's previous poem. It is, of course, true that in the absence of further discussion in Works and days, speculation about the term is pointless.</page><page sequence="10">154 JACKSON P. HERSHBELL the shiftless to work; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbor ... (11 f.) In other words, Strife has not only a destructive but also a constructive function within the cosmos. Having made the foregoing observations concerning Hesiod's thought, a closer exam- ination of the relationship between him and Empedocles is possible. There is little doubt, of course, that the primary ingredi- ents of the cosmos, according to Empedo- cles, are Love and Strife and the "four roots of all things." Given these six major fac- tors, together with his acceptance of the Parmenidean axiom that what is not is unintelligible, Empedocles is able to offer a description of the cosmos. Ontology culmi- nates in cosmology, and in a passage remi- niscent of Hesiod's Theog. 108-111,32 Em- pedocles addresses his friend Pausanias: "Come, I will tell you first . . . from which all things which we now see came forth: earth and the many-waved sea and the moist air and the Titan aether binding tight around the whole circle." (B38) To be sure, the exact nature or composition of Empedocles' roots and the specific roles of Love and Strife in relation to the roots and in relation to one another remain, to some degree, unclear. For example, are the roots the minimal portions of reality or are they, in turn, constructed out of even smaller particles; in other words, are there "ele- ments of elements"? In addition to Love and Strife are there other powers, e.g., Chance or Necessity, which govern the world? Despite these and other problems which have been raised concerning the de- tails of Empedocles' thought, the general outlines seem clear.33 In essence, it will be argued, the impetus for Empedocles' thought is found in Hesiod, and the termi- nology and thought of the latter are taken over, reworked and expanded to the extent that, using the notion of "roots" and Love and Strife, Empedocles is able to produce a reasonably complete picture of the cos- mos, a picture that is at once mythical or supernatural and quasi-scientific or natural. The "roots" are first mentioned in the present order of Empedocles' fragments in Diels-Kranz in B6: "Hear first the four roots of all things: bright Zeus and life- bringing Hera and Aidoneus and Nestis who moistens a mortal spring with her tears." Though the language of B6 is quite different, this fragment is compared in the Diels-Kranz commentary with Theog. 736 f. where the four roots, i.e., those of earth, Tartarus, sea, and heaven, are also men- tioned in two verses.34 In another frag- ment, B23.9-10, Empedocles uses, like Hesiod, the word "spring" (r~y~y) almost as a synonym for "root": "Thus let not decep- tion overcome your mind that the spring of perishable creatures is from any other source" (presumably the roots)."3 Earth, Tartarus, sea, and heaven were, of course, divine for Hesiod, and so it is not surprising that Empedocles gives divine names to his roots. But the divine names given in B6 are later replaced by a vocabulary no longer theological but cosmological. In B 17.18 the roots are "fire and water and earth and the immense height of air." Again in B22.2 a similar phrasing appears. Fire specifically appears as flame (B85) and sun or Helios (B21.3). In other words, the tendency already in Hesiod's Theogony to see, for example, Gaea not only as goddess of the earth, but as earth itself, a cosmic principle, is developed by Empedocles to the point where the theological becomes subordinate to, and almost vanishes from the cosmo- logical. Yet despite Empedocles' apparent preference for the plain language of quasi- scientific description, there is little doubt 32 This part of the Theogony may also be com- pared with Parmenides B11. West, Theogony, p. 190. 33 For further discussion of these problems, the reader is referred to Millerd, On interpretation, and Guthrie, History, II. 34 DK, I, p. 312. ' That the fragment refers to the roots is argued by Guthrie, History, II, p. 148.</page><page sequence="11">HESIOD AND EMPEDOCLES 155 that his roots are sentient (see B 103), and at times they seem to have an activity of their own. Fire "hides itself" (,oxa-tEro) in the round pupils of the eye (B84.8). Fire sends up shapes desiring to reach its like (B62); and in a passage highly reminiscent both in thought and language of Works and days (60 f.) where Zeus bids Hephaestus to "mix earth with water and to put in it the voice and strength of human kind, and fashion a charming lovely shape of a maiden," Empedocles describes Cypris (Love) who "after she had moistened the earth with water, as she fashioned the forms of living things gave them to swift fire to harden" (B73). If Aristotle's report can be trusted, "the elements too are gods" for Empedocles.36 There are, of course, similarities as well as important differences between Empedocles' divine roots and Hesiod's gods. Consider first, the concept of privileges or spheres of influence (r?Tatl) and allotment (pozpa) so prominent in Hesiod's thought. For exam- ple, from her birth Aphrodite is given the honor of going into the assembly of the gods, and she is allotted a portion of activ- ity in human love (Theog. 203-205). After Zeus overcame his father Cronos, he dis- tributed to the gods "their portions and declared their privileges" (Theog. 74-75). Hecate, who receives special attention in the Theogony, holds privileges in heaven and earth, sits by kings in judgment, gives victory in battle and games, is nurse of the young (415 f.). Empedocles also speaks of the roots as having privileges: "Each is master in a different province (rtpi~) and each has its own character" (B17.28). But unlike Hesiod's gods, except possibly for Chaos, Earth, Tartarus, and Eros, Emped- ocles' roots are "all equal and coeval" (B17.27).37 Moreover, the roots are im- mortal, not only in the sense of being indestructible: they are also unbegotten (B7). For Hesiod the gods, although im- mortal, i.e., not subject to death (JOilvaro-), are begotten. Even at the first Chaos came to be (yIVE0-o) and no more is said about what, if anything, preceded it. In fact, the vast collection of divine and semi-divine names in the Theogony is organized in descending series and gathered into suc- cessive generations, to the point that the time interval in this scheme is measured by the genos, and the events that generally take place are always genesis and tokos, begetting and bearing. Yet, Empedocles' roots, as well as Love and Strife, abide eternally; they have no origin, and one can no longer speak of the birth and death of things in the cosmos, only of mixing and the exchange of what has been mixed (B8). But, most important, what were vaguely described as the "roots" or "springs" of earth and sea, Tartarus and sky in Hesiod's Theogony become, and specifically so, earth, air, fire, and water in Empedocles. These are themselves the roots of all things, and as is made clear in B22.1-3 they do not lose their separate identities when they mingle with each other to form the world: "For all of these-the shining sun and earth and sky and sea-are all matched in full accord with their own parts which are scat- tered far from them in mortal things" (compare the 7rI`TvKEV of this verse with 7rEaaut in Theog. 728). The roots more- over are qualitatively unalterable: "but these things are ever the same, but run- ning through each other they form now one thing, now another, and they are ever continuously the same" (B 17.34-35). De- spite their homogeneity, however, the roots apparently can, under the influence of Love, be drawn together into one. In fact, there seems to be a nearly perfect blend of the roots so that "then are discerned neither the swift limbs of the sun nor the shaggy strength of the earth nor the sea" (B27.1-2). In other words, under the reign of Love, the roots are so thoroughly mixed or blended as to be indistinguishable, 3 Gen. et corr. 333b20. See Guthrie, History, II, p. 143, n. 3. 37 For further discussion of this point, see Jae- ger, Theology, p. 139.</page><page sequence="12">156 JACKSON P. HERSHBELL and the form of the cosmos under this con- dition is a sphere "held fast in the close obscurity of Harmony . . . rejoicing in its circular stillness" (B27.3-4)."3 Aristotle reports that this sphere was "the most blessed god" for Empedocles,39 and in B29, the poet declares: "For no two branches spring from its back, there / are no feet nor nimble limbs, no reproductive parts." The same two verses are found in B 134, a frag- ment usually assigned to the Purifications, but with the variant "hairy parts." Two things stand out in the foregoing account of Empedocles' doctrine of the roots. First, the idea of the intermingling of the roots under Love's influence so as to form a unity may have been suggested by Hesiod's roots of earth and sea which, according to one interpretation, gradually disappear into the underworld and became so intertwined as to be indistinguishable. Secondly, B29.1 echoes Hesiod's Theog. 150, and one need only recall Hesiod's ter- rible tale of Uranos' castration by Cronos (Theog. 159 f.) to see the point of Empedo- cles' rejection of "parts of generation." In other words, B29 (cf. B134), which pre- sumably describes the intermingling of the roots under Love, is also a disguised polemic against Hesiodic (and no doubt Homeric) conceptions of deity. Only with the anthro- pomorphic deities of the Greek epic in the background can Empedocles' desire to deny human characteristics of his sphere be un- derstood. In general, Empedocles' roots, the origin of the concept being in Hesiod's poems, are on the way to replacing the gods of the Theogony. They have some of the characteristics of these gods, but, for the most part, are divested of human charac- teristics, and the way is prepared for a natural description of the world. Despite the possibility that the roots had an inherent power of movement, Empedo- cles' account of the origin and structure of the cosmos would be incomplete were it not for the action of Love and Strife. Like the roots, they are everlasting (B 16) and they are somehow equal to them: "baneful Strife apart from them [the roots] equal in all directions and love among them equal in length and in breadth" (B17.19-20). Gen- erally speaking, Love has the function of drawing together dissimilar entities, e.g., water and earth, whereas Strife is responsi- ble for uniting like to like, e.g., water to water. What is, of course, immediately apparent in this scheme of things is how indispensable Love is to the world at pres- ent. Under the influence of Strife the four roots would be presumably separated into four distinct masses (like to like), and organic life would not be possible.40 Simi- larly, without Eros the theogony described by Hesiod would probably not have been possible, and as erotic, sexual imagery played an important part in Hesiod's poem, so too in that of Empedocles. Two of his roots are male: Zeus and Aidoneus; two are female: Hera and Nestis (though this may be accidental), and the power respon- sible for the mingling of the roots is called in the fragments Philotes, Aphrodite, Har- monia, Cypris, names suggestive of sexual relations.41 Only the name Eros is not found in the extant fragments, though Plu- tarch's report in De fac. lun. (926D) sug- gests that Empedocles could have used this word as well: ". . . for Affection arose or Aphrodite or Eros, as Empedocles says and Parmenides and Hesiod...." In a passage reminiscent of Hesiod's description of Aph- rodite's role in human affairs (Theog. 204- 206), Empedocles declares: "She too is acknowledged by mortals as being rooted in their limbs and through her they have troughts of love and accomplish the works of union, calling her Joy by name and 38On other possible translations of this verse, see Guthrie, History, II, p. 169. 39 Metaphysics 1000b3. 40 According to Solmsen's interpretation of Em- pedocles, Strife has built up the cosmos, and Love fashions living beings within it. See his valuable study, "Love and strife in Empedocles' cosmol- ogy," Phronesis 10 (1965) 109-148. 41 See Solmsen, JHI 24, 476.</page><page sequence="13">HESIOD AND EMPEDOCLES 157 Aphrodite" (B17.21 f.) Through Love the roots "are dear to one another" (B22.1); they come together in Love and are desired by one another. But despite his use of sexual imagery, Empedocles does not refer, at least in the remaining fragments, to the mixings of the roots as "births" or "beget- tings." The theme of birth so prevalent in the Theogony is replaced by that of mix- ture. In Empedocles' poems Strife is usually called Neikos, not Eris as in Hesiod (eris does appear in the fragments though only in the plural, B124.2 and B20.4, probably in the sense of quarrels and discords). Strife is also not explicitly said to be pres- ent in human activities (for Hesiod, Eris like Aphrodite is present in human affairs) though there is reason to think that Em- pedocles would have considered it familiar to men in their dealings. In the Theogony Eris was responsible for a considerable progeny (226 f.), and when Empedocles describes the joyless land in B121, one cannot resist speculating that this too is a catalogue of Strife's offspring: ". . . Mur- der and Wrath and the tribes of other Dooms, and Wasting Disease and Corrup- tions and the Works of Dissolution wander over the meadow of Disaster in Darkness." Empedocles describes himself as a wan- derer who trusted in hate (B115.14); men are born from "conflicts and groanings" (B124). But from the generally negative picture of Strife given by Empedocles it would be wrong to conclude that Strife is wholly destructive. As Hesiod distinguished two kinds of Strife, one of them found in wholesome competition, so for Empedocles our present world could not exist without Strife. The Strife which disrupts the sphere of Love is somehow responsible for the sep- aration of the large masses of the roots- earth, air, sea, and heaven-and without these as backdrop, the organic world could not exist. In short, both Love and Strife are necessary for the present world if there is to be a cosmos at all. As with his roots, so Empedocles has not wholly divested Love and Strife of some of the characteristics of Hesiod's gods. Ulti- mately their relationship is conceived much as one of antagonism, conflict, and both Plutarch and Proclus in later antiquity con- nected the strife of Empedocles with the mythical wars of the Titans and Giants.42 Though he comes close to the concept, Em- pedocles does not speak of forces of attrac- tion and repulsion; and his roots are not elements. His ontology and cosmology in its broad outlines are still dominated by the language and thought of Hesiod. III. Other Themes Common to the Thought of Hesiod and Empedocles Although in many of the surviving frag- ments of his poems Empedocles is concerned with building the cosmos, his purpose is not wholly cosmological or ontological. There is also a distinct ethical or moral emphasis, especially in the fragments usually assigned to the Purifications. Even in some of the fragments of On nature Empedocles' phra- seology is often ethical and not logical.43 For example, he prays to avoid speaking "more than is sanctioned or right" (borx5), not "more than is true" (B3.7); "what is right" (Kaho'v) can be said twice (B25). In the Purifications there is, of course, an unmistakable moral view of things, to- gether with various injunctions, e.g., to abstain from laurel leaves (B140), and beans (B 141), and to cease from slaugh- ter (B136). Notably in B135 Empedo- cles declares: "But that which is lawful (voe?tpov) is spread continouously through- out the broad-ruling air and the boundless light of heaven." Aristotle in the Rhetoric (1373b) interpreted the fragment in con- junction with Sophocles' Antigone as ex- 42 DK, I, p. 323. The reference to Plutarch is De fac. lun. (926D). Proclus connects the Strife of Empedocles with the war of the Giants, In Pla- tonis Parmenidem comment. ed. Cousin (Paris 1864), p. 849, 13-15. 43 This was observed by Millerd, On interpreta- tion, p. 25, n. 1.</page><page sequence="14">158 JACKSON P. HERSHBELL pressing a universal law of nature. Accord- ing to him, Empedocles forbade the killing of living creatures, claiming that it is not just for some and unjust for others. C. E. Millerd commented on B135 that the "thought is a remarkable one in this pe- riod."44 Yet this passage and other frag- ments of Empedocles' poems, e.g., B136 and B128, are not without parallels to Hesiod's thought, especially that of Works and days. A recurring theme of this poem is the necessity of just dealing and the avoid- ance of hybris. And although Hesiod never defines justice, but only gives repeated ex- amples, he is concerned to prove to his fellow men that justice is best. Zeus has ordained a system of rewards for the just and punishment for the wicked in this world; for "those who practice savage inso- lence and evil deeds Zeus, the far-seeing son of Cronos, fixes a penalty" (v. 238); Zeus has "thrice ten thousand immortal spirits on the bounteous earth to watch over mor- tal men" (v. 252-253); the eye of Zeus "seeing all things, understanding all things S. . does not fail to note what manner of justice our city keeps" (v. 267-269). The commands of Zeus are clear: "listen to right and do not foster violence" (v. 212). Finally, the son of Cronos ". .. has or- dained this law (vdpov) for men, that fishes and beasts and winged birds should eat one another, for right ( 1Kq) is not in them; but to mankind he gave right which proves far best" (275 f.). To recognize Dike is the one thing that gives man his dignity and sets him apart from animals. It is regrettable that there is no context for B 135 of Empedocles' poem, but perhaps it can safely be said that if the fragment pertains to the prohibition of killing living creatures, it is Empedocles' recognition of what Hesiod had expressed years before. Men should not "feast on one another in the thoughtlessness of their minds" (B136) nor should they kill other creatures, for somehow all life is akin and sacred. Indeed there was a time "when all things were tame and gentle to man, both beasts and birds, and the fire of friendliness is kindled" (B 130). Hesiod's recognition of a law im- plicit in the nature of things is echoed and perhaps extended so that it embraces all living things. Yet another Hesiodic note is struck when Empedocles looks back to a golden age (though this epithet, so far as is known, was not used by him). For Hesiod there was a time during the reign of Cronos when men, except for their mortality, lived like gods; pain and old age were unknown, and death came like sleep; earth bore fruit abundantly without human labor (W. d. 110 f.). The age of "golden" men, however, was supplanted by subsequent generations of silver, brazen, and heroic men, culmi- nating with a race of iron. This present age is one of toil and sorrow; men will dishonor their parents; destroy cities; oaths will not be honored, and respect will fail. Like Hesiod, Empedocles heightens the darkness and misery of the present age by contrast with a former time: Nor had they Ares as a god nor Cydoimos nor was Zeus king nor Cronos nor Poseidon, but Cypris was queen. Her they propitiated with holy gifts and painted figures of animals and perfumes, with sacrifice of unmixed myrrh and fragrant incense, casting to the ground liba- tions of golden yellow honeycombs, and the altar was not wet with the unmixed blood of bulls but this was the greatest stain of guilt among men after tearing out the life to eat the limbs as food. (B128) There are, of course, differences between the two poets' conceptions of the past age. For Hesiod the men of the golden age lived under the reign of Cronos, who gained his rule by violence, castrating Uranos his father with a jagged sickle. Empedocles, for his part, thinks of a period before that of the Olympian gods, when blood sacrifices were not made, and Aphrodite prevailed everywhere. Indeed implicit in his account of this former age is a rejection of the gods of Hesiod. Possibly men, by observing Empedocles' 44 Ibid., p. 94.</page><page sequence="15">HESIOD AND EMPEDOCLES 159 prohibitions, can be expected to draw closer to this ideal age. But the idea of prohibit- ing certain forms of behavior was made much of by Hesiod in the Works and days. Perses or men in general are cautioned to avoid the anger of the gods (v. 706), and various injunctions follow, e.g., do not get a reputation for being extravagant (v. 715), take nothing to eat from vessels until sacri- fice has been made over them (v. 748 f.), do not urinate in springs (v. 758), etc. Indeed, Empedocles' prohibition to abstain from laurel leaves, though possibly con- nected with B127, which suggests that cer- tain daimones become incarnated in laurel trees, is explained by the fact that the Muses grant to Hesiod a rod of sturdy laurel (Theog. 30), the laurel being sacred to Apollo, the Muses' associate (Theog. 94). Mantic properties were associated with the laurel, and it is in connection with the poetic craft that a final comparison between Hesiod and Empedocles can be drawn. The character of Empedocles has been a subject of much speculation and writing. Charlatan, medicine-man, mystic are some of the judgments made about him. Espe- cially perplexing is his claim to go among men as an "immortal god, no longer mor- tal" (B112.4); crowds desire to hear his prophecies and words of healing. Claims like these seem preposterous in our present literate, scientific, and technological age. But the key to understanding Empedocles, is given in the fragments of his poems when they are read in conjunction with Hesiod's views on poetry as expressed in the The- ogony, 75 f. The important fragments of Empedocles' poems are B 131 and B146: But if for the sake of creatures of a day, O immortal Muse, it has pleased thee to allow my work to go through thy thoughts, stand beside me now as I pray, O Calliope, while I show forth a sound doctrine about the gods. (B131) But at last they become prophets and singers and physicians and leaders among mortal men; from thence they rise up as gods chief in honors. (B 146) Compare these fragments with some lines in Theog. 75 f.: These things then the Muses sang who dwell on Olympus . . . Cleio and Euterpe, Thaleia ... and Calliope, who surpasses them all, for she accompanies respected princes .... all the people look on him while he decides .... And when he passes through a gathering, they greet him as a god with gracious reverence, and he is distinguished among the assembled. For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are singers and harpists on earth; but princes are from Zeus, and happy is he whom the Muses love .... For though a man have sorrow and grief in his newly- troubled spirit and lives in dread because his heart is distressed, yet, when a singer, servant of the Muses, chants the glorious deeds of for- mer men and the blessed gods of Olympus, at once he forgets his heaviness and does not even remember his sorrows. There are distinct echoes of this passage of Hesiod's Theogony in the fragments of Em- pedocles quoted previously: for both poets, singers or bards (doitool in Hesiod, Theog. 95; VvoirodXo in Empedocles B146.1) and princes (/oatXk^Es in Hesiod) or chiefs (in Empedocles the word is ambiguous; 7rpdoL could mean "fighters in the front ranks") have an important function. For Hesiod princes are greeted with respect and treated like gods; the bard has a healing influence on his audience.45 Calliope appears, and though she is the queen of epic poetry, she is first identified by Hesiod; Van Gro- ningen has seen her as a vestige of Hesiodic influence on Empedocles.46 There is little doubt that for both poets the bard has an important place in society, and in both there is an ambiguity in their treatment. In Hesiod the prince is regarded as if he 45B146 also shows great similarity to Od. 17.382-385: "But whoever summons a stranger, having gone to him himself, unless it be one of those who are masters of public crafts, a prophet, or a healer of ills, or a builder, or indeed a divine minstrel, who gives delight with his song?" In this passage the bard is again given a position of prominence in his society. 4G B. A.

HERSHBELL were a kind of poet, though the social func- tions are distinguishable. E. A. Havelock in discussing the passage has observed: "The prince wields political power; he is therefore Zeus' child. The minstrel wields power over words; he therefore is the child of Apollo and the Muses. But the two kinds of power are somehow coeval, linked together. In practical terms a prince might formulate his own edicts and if he could and did, the greater might be his influence. More likely the poet did it for him. Hence, earlier in this passage, and with the same bifocal vision, Hesiod had spoken of the 'Muse' consorting with the prince: this symbolizes the minstrel standing by his side attendant to his words which he is to re- frame in epe for the audience . ... "47 A full context for the fragments of Empedo- cles is lacking, but it is difficult to believe that his linking together of healer, bard, prophet, and leader is wholly accidental. In his own life he was at least bard and leader if the tradition can be trusted that he was active in the politics of Akragas. And it would not be amiss to view his func- tion of healer in connection with his poetic gift. The passage from Hesiod suggests that the bard had a therapeutic effect, at least on his hearer's psyche. Similarly in other cultures the bard is considered to have healing influence.48 One need only recall that Apollo himself was the associate of the Muses and god of healing (he may be the god without human characteristics, the god of thought mentioned in B134; at least he is according to the report of Ammonius). Whether the same or similar cultural con- ditions prevailed in both the time of Hesiod and that of Empedocles is difficult to say. There is reason to think, however, that no vast strides had been made in literacy, and the common man at least was dependent on those who could memorize the formulaic traditions of the past. Ancient Greece was predominantly an oral culture and within this Empedocles must not be seen as a charlatan, but as the aoidos, "the singer of tales.""49 He differs, of course, from many of those before him, including Hesiod. His mythos, the content of his poems, is no longer the tales of glorious deeds of men and gods. On the contrary, he will tell how worlds come to be and how they end; how one can gain knowledge of and control over the environment; and in the eyes of his contemporaries, he stood, like other bards, as a mediator between the world of sense and the world of spirit. IV. Conclusion This study of Hesiod and Empedocles has been hampered, as any study of the lat- ter must be, by the lack of the complete poems of Empedocles. It is tempting to speculate, for example, that Empedocles also recounted a theogony like Hesiod in the lost sections of his poems. In intro- ducing B128 Porphyry (De abst. II 20, borrowed from Theophrastus' De pietate) says the fragment occurs "when he (Em- pedocles) writes concerning the generation of the gods (O0oyovia) and on sacrifices." But all one reads in the fragment is that Cypris is a very old goddess, existing be- fore Cronos, Zeus, Poseidon, Ares, and Cydoimos. In any case, Porphyry's remark 47 E. A. Havelock, Preface to Plato (Cambridge, Mass. 1963), p. 110. 48 Compare the following passage in the Ma- habharata with B111 of Empedocles' poem (con- sidered spurious by Van Groningen, see footnote 11 of this study): And those who will recite this great adventure of Nala, and those who will hear it attentively, misfortune shall not visit them. . . . He shall be free from sickness ... The passage is quoted in A. B. Lord, "Homer and other poetry" in A companion to Homer, ed. A. J. B. Wace and F. H. Stubbings (New York 1963), p. 199-200. 49 On the importance and function of the bard in oral culture, see ibid., p. 181-184, 197 f. Have- lock's book, Preface, is a well-argued attempt to show that Greece, at least until the time of Plato, was predominantly an oral culture and that Plato was trying to demolish the hold of the epic on the intellect of his countrymen.</page><page sequence="17">HESIOD AND EMPEDOCLES 161 seems not to be supported by the text. But whether Empedocles wrote a theogony or not, there is little doubt that he was influ- enced in other respects by Hesiod. Emped- ocles' originality and importance, especially in the development of the later doctrine of the four elements, has not been denied. Nor has it been maintained that he took this or other theories wholesale from Hesiod. No doubt the origins of the four elements can be found in the latter's poems.50 What Empedocles did was to borrow the language of Hesiod, e.g., that of "roots," as well as some conceptions of Hesiod, notably Love and Strife, reinterpret and develop them to a point where a reasonably coherent and complete picture of the universe could be drawn, a picture largely divested of the theological apparatus of the epic tradition. In this respect, Empedocles went vastly beyond Hesiod. Divinity is not to be found in the anthropomorphic gods of the past, but in the roots, and the cosmic sphere, and in the action of Love and Hate. Beginning with these a universe of myriad things, even as minute as the eye and ear, can be de- scribed and explained. The epic of Greek tradition is to be replaced by a new epic, one on a vaster and grander scale even than the sack of Troy or the birth of the gods. But in Empedocles' undertaking lay the seeds of dissolution. The language and thought of epic poetry, imagistic and con- crete, cannot compete with the exactness and precision of a quasi-scientific prose. Empedocles' epic, like those of Homer and Hesiod, was eventually to be supplanted by the dialogue of Plato and the treatise of Aristotle.51 Guthrie sees B17.14 (". .. for learning will increase your understanding") as per- haps aimed at Heraclitus B40.52 But it is in this fragment that Hesiod, among others, is attacked by Heraclitus: Much learning does not teach one to have intelligence; for it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Hecataeus. Empedocles was no doubt critical of Hesiod, especially of the latter's views of the gods, and would have agreed with Xenophanes' polemic; but it is tempting to see him also as a defender of Hesiod.
