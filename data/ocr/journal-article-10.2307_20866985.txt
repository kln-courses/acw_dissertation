<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hybridity, Ethos, and Visual Representations of Smokey Bear Marguerite Helmers In Edward Abbey's satirical and controversial novel The Monkey Wrench Gang, the ecoterrorists Bonnie Abbzug and George Hayduke travel through the American Southwest committing random acts of mayhem and destruction, focusing their attention on any endeavors undertaken by business and government that might infringe on the great open spaces of the west. At one point, the pair stops near a Smokey Bear fire alert sign, "a life-size simulacrum of the notorious ursine bore" (226). Here they paint on a mustache and give Smokey some red eyes; Hayduke adds a footnote to the message "Only YOU can prevent forest fires": "Smokey Bear is full of shit" (227). As is clear from Abbey's prose, Abbzug and Hayduke are toying with the idea of the bear as simulacrum; they are not interacting with a real bear or even with The Original Smokey (whomever or whatever that may be), but with a representation of a representation?and a representation that they construe as part of the agency of the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management?any authority attempting to control the natural order. In effect, the protagonists see through the artifice of the represen tation; they recognize Smokey as a human instrument of power and so they give him his due: a penis. Abbzug and Hayduke's actions introduce a prevalent theme in the history of Smokey Bear/human/animal relations: the confusion of ontol ogy. Alice Wondrak Biel reminds us that Smokey is a "familiar half-man, half-bear who walks around in a pair of denim jeans, carries a shovel, and sports a hat" (71). But even Biel, whose insightful text Do (Not) Feed the Bears focuses in part on visual aspects of bear display, is at a loss to explain jac 31.1-2 (2011)</page><page sequence="2">46 jac the confusing hybridization of Smokey, for she notes as well that "Smokey started out as a 'real' bear and grew into a man-bear," which is somewhat true, but, as one finds when attempting to describe Smokey, not true at all (71). Smokey started out as a cartoon bear already wearing the pants, became a real bear named Smokey when a cub was discovered after a fire in Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico, and persists as an icon in American collective consciousness as a man-bear. Biel attributes his ability to shape-shift from bear to man to the influence of comic book superheroes on American imagination, which is an intriguing suggestion since superheroes such as Batman, Catwoman, Wolverine, Sabertooth, and The Beast are hybrid characters who either dress in animal inspired costumes or are mutant fusions of human and animal characteristics in much the same way that Smokey Bear is fashioned. Smokey Bear is able to be fashioned according to the desires of the culture that produces him. As an icon, he is subject to parody and abuse, as well as more traditional and predictable appearances. In yet another American West protest novel, The Milagro Beanfield War, Smokey Bear is a target for local animosity (Nichols). The residents of the small high desert New Mexican town of Milagro steal a number of souvenir Smokey Bear santos from a sales counter at the Forest Service headquar ters. Santos are traditionally small carved figurines of the Virgin Mary and Catholic saints, prominently displayed in elaborate domestic altars. They too are simulacra, although they are simulacra invested with the power of essence, or ousia, of mystic presence. The residents of Milagro use the Smokey santos as voodoo dolls: In short, they kicked the little Smokeys around their houses; they poured kerosene on the little Smokeys and lit them; they hammered nails into the little Smokeys; and in a great many other imaginative and bestial ways they desecrated Snuffy Ledoux's carvings in hopes of either destroying the United States Forest Service or at least driving that Forest Service away from Chamisa County, and, in particular, away from Milagro. (193) Icons are real presences that initiate communion with an eternal and transcendent spirit. As asanto carved for touristic consumption, Smokey represents the earthly presence of government and an intrusion on</page><page sequence="3">Marguerite Helmers 47 indigenous culture. It is not only the BIA or the BLM or the NPS that intrudes, but also an entire way of life that consumes landscape, nature, and native cultures as commodities. Studying key moments in the Smokey Bear public service campaign may not tell us much about the ontology of bears as living mammals, but it can reveal the desires and fears of humans who represent the bear and also reveal the culture into which Smokey was deployed. In studying the appearance of Smokey Bear in American culture and the ensuing history of representations and attitudes toward both Smokey and biological bears, several interpretive problems emerge. Initially, we have a history of design based on the posters that initially depict a Smokey Bear and spread his message to the American public. Second is the relationship of humans to biological bears during the post World War II period, in particular a combination of park service practices and tourist anticipations and antics that domesticated the bears as objects of display and entertainment. And third is the rebirth of Smokey as a biological bear in 1950?which in turn became the focus of a comic book titled The True Story of Smokey Bear in which the "real" bear is animated as Smokey. In addition to these primary story themes, there is a vast body of Smokey Bear material culture spanning sixty five years; it includes posters, television spots, children's books, comics, toys, and costumed mascots. In the field of animal studies, theory relates to the conditions of representation surrounding biological animals. At the borders of species naming and identification, in language and in life, absolute difference between a human us and an animal them is blurred, especially as one considers that humans are animals, what theorists remind us is the "human animal." However, there are a considerable number of animal represen tations that exhibit human characteristics, most notably iconic Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Jiminy Cricket, and Simba the Lion King, and Theodor Geisel's (Dr. Seuss's) Cat in the Hat and Horton the elephant. Such characters, although recognizable as animals, operate in the realm of the human; their gestures, language, and attire are human. We can conclude that, because they are created by humans for human consumption, these animals are in the service of the human animals who have power over them. They are created to meet the desires of the culture that produces them.</page><page sequence="4">48 jac My analysis of Smokey Bear examines the formal properties of forest fire advertisements and considers the historical situation in which they appeared. My purpose is to examine the way Smokey Bear's animal/ human hybridism constructs human response. One of the most powerful aspects of the bear's persona is his character, in the sense that Aristotle construed it as ethos, "the most effective means of persuasion" (Rhetoric, 1.2.1356.10). An enduring American cultural icon, Smokey Bear's "ac tions and appearance (clothing grooming, possessions)... contribute to the characterization to produce a persuasive communication designed to elicit a particular response from an audience" (Mulvey and Medina 224). Kenneth Burke called the process of persuasion through character identification. The unspoken trace in Smokey's mediated and fictional animality is his alignment with white, working-class males. The boundary between human and animal and between male and female is at his beltline. While Smokey Bear's attire is based on that of the National Park Service, he is noticeably without the traditional forest green uniform that was standard from the 1920s. Clad in dungarees, Smokey Bear is shown to be a man of the people, a worker, one of what the Beats liked to call the "fellahin," as Gary Snyder hints when he writes in his "Smokey the Bear Sutra" thatthe bear is "[wjearing the blue work overalls symbolic of slaves and laborers, the countless men oppressed by a civilization that claims to save but often destroys" (26). Smokey's uniform is most like the garb of the Depression-Era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a group of workers who embodied the value of service and aligned it with patriotism and the parks. The connection between the CCC and Smokey Bear is illustrated by a 193 8 poster known as "The Spirit of CCC" or "The Spirit of 1938," painted by Harry Rossoll, who was later to become one of the Smoky Bear illustrators. One of the CCC workers is shirtless like Smokey; he wears dungarees, and, again like Smokey, he carries a shovel. The jeans were a clever visual rhetorical move on the part of the Ad Council because, while Smokey's hat aligns him with the authority of the Park Service rangers (and gives him the history of the Stetsons worn by legendary Texas Rangers), his pants make him one of the people. In a further confusion over who owns Smokey Bear, though, NPS ranger's hats are commonly known as "Smokey Bear hats," even though Smokey was a product of the U.S. Forest Service.</page><page sequence="5">Marguerite Helmers 49 Figure 1: "The Spirit of 1938," poster by Harry Rossoll While in this article I will focus on what I believe are some of the prevalent themes of the Smokey Bear phenomenon, I can present and discuss on ly a fraction of the material avai lable for consumption and must foray gently into the vast and multifaceted material and discursive world of the bear. Furthermore, because Smokey has been multiply authored over six decades, there is no consistent representation of him in any media other than his clothing (hat and denims) and his persistent message. A few words about what I do not address are in order. I acknowledge, but do not discuss, the anthropomorphic personification of the bear that leads, potentially, to frequently deadly real-world encounters (deadly for both bear and human); the legal controls established over biological bears as species; the federal laws governing the use of Smokey Bear's image; and the fascinating indigenous histories of mythologized bears. Furthermore, it can certainly be argued, as Steve Baker contends, that because Smokey Bear is "the pictorial image of the animal [he] does not signify 'animal' at all. Instead it is treated as the transparent signifier of something quite</page><page sequence="6">50 jac different" (136). In the case of the pictorial image of Smokey Bear, the chain of signification does not lead backto biological, non-human animals, but to human desires, codes of conduct, and federal regulations. Viewers of this particular bear and other mediated animals are habituated to recognize that the "pictorial image of the animal" represents human pathologies, symptomatic of "relations of class, or race, or gender" (Wolfe 567). Scholars working in the field of animal studies encourage a destabilization of "the schema of the human," as Cary Wolfe put it in a recent article(568). The reflexivityofvision, in which the observed animal stares back at the viewer and challenges the audience's habituated ways of seeing, is an essential element of visual rhetorical study. As Erica Fudge has pointed out, it is unquestioned that humans create animal worlds and animal selves, but a key theoretical intervention in research on non-human animals and animal representations is to question the ways in which humans "are constructed by animals" (qtd. in Wolfe 566). The challenge at that point, Rosie Braidotti explains, "is how to deterritorialize, or nomadize," the human/animal interactions, so as to bypass "the dialectics of otherness." In many ways, Smokey Bear's history as a hybrid does bypass "the dialectics of otherness." His difference from other mediated animals is that he is able to destabilize the human viewer due to his fluctuating animal/human alterity. As the early posters demonstrate, Smokey's watchful and accusing eye breaks beyond the storyworld of the picture frame to pose a question to the viewer. Therefore, a visual rhetorical analysis of the potential of mediated animals to construct human response will question what the animals do within the text. In addition, it is important to seek moments of subversion, points when the mediated animals break from the frame to confront the human codes of signification. As a topos for representation, Smokey Bear has spawned numerous characterizations ranging from comic to noble, all in efforts to make humans more aware of their actions. Thus, as an introduction to the question of the hybrid bear-man, I have selected a number of posters from the early history of the Smokey Bear ad campaign that establish Smokey in the cultural imaginary and position him as an authoritative spokesperson for public and private human behaviors. In particular, I focus on the drawings of Albert Staehle, the first to create Smokey Bear for the American public.</page><page sequence="7">Marguerite Helmers 51 I take as a departure point for this piece Alexander Wilson's assertion that, "Our ability to produce images of nature is an index of our power over it" (122). Smokey Bear falls under the class of animals who are understood to be mediated by human desires and rhetorical practices, which I will call the realm of mediated animals, those fictional and animated constructs that are not biologically or ontologically real, but which nonetheless raise questions about interspecies relationships and communications. Richard Tapper comments that, in general, both biological and mediated animals are modeled as Beasts or Brutes in human discourse: Sometimes certain animals are idealized and used as models of order and morality, in animal stories and myths [like Smokey bear]. [Such] animals are treated as agents and social beings, with motives, values and morals; and differences between them and people are implicitly denied. (49-50). The construct Smokey Bear has been the symbol of a moral social being since 1944, when he was first used by the U.S. Forest Service to teach humans how to behave in the wilderness. Smokey is attributed benevolent, coercive motives and effectively reverses the dichotomy between humans and non-human animals because he knows more than humans about the sanctity of the forests. A concern for human relationships to the wild emerges in American popular culture after World War II and coincides with the rise in technologies of tourism, such as the car, television, film, advertising, roads, and campsites. As Wilson points out in The Culture of Nature, our experience of the natural world is always shaped by technologies, as technology?including, but not limited to, maps, GPS, road signs, tourist brochures?allows selected and specific access to areas marked as natural or wild, opposing them to industrial and urban worlds of work and residence (12). The development of postwar tourism also fostered concerns over the appropriate uses and treatment of natural landscapes and natural resources. Into this milieu, Smokey Bear entered the American scene, in 1944. Wilson writes that after WWII, Outdoor recreation had become a mass phenomenon. For holidays, people often went on automobile trips along new roads that reached far into the natural areas of the continent. (27)</page><page sequence="8">52 jac With the rise in tourism came a rise in the need to manage human-biological bear relations. The late 1950s saw several confused efforts by the National Park Service to warn visitors away from feeding bears in Yellowstone National Park, the quintessential American bear park; nonetheless, in the summer of 1957, "908 written warnings and 3,800 verbal warnings were issued," and in 1959 "rangers had issued 1,200 written warnings" to tourists who were intent on feeding bears by hand, often from the windows of their cars (Biel 65). Yellowstone in particular had a long history of encouraging close human-bear relationships, even going so far as to erect seating platforms near garbage dumps so that humans could watch the bears forage for food (Biel 20). Horace Albright, superintendent of Yellowstone in the early decades of the twentieth century, defended the NPS actions by stating that bears were "personi fied": "They are like people, and the visitors to the parks want to treat them as such" (qtd. in Biel 24). The Origins of Smokey Bear and the Disappearance of the Animal Smokey Bear was created by the Wartime Ad Council (which later became the Ad Council), an organization that connected commercial advertisers with the government and the public during World War II, as one of several public campaigns to employ "the skills and facilities of advertising for information and persuasion in other than commercial ventures, and specifically in the public interest" (qtd. in O'Barr 4). According to William O'Barr, public service campaigns were not initially intended as altruistic ventures, but were attempting "to make efforts to improve the public face of advertising" in an "anti-advertising atmosphere that had developed in America during the Roosevelt years" (O'Barr 4). The war provided an opportunity for advertisers to support the war efforts of American industry, as well as tend to the social needs for self sufficiency (expressed through messages about thrift and rationing and the creation of victory gardens) and for secrecy. The birth of Smokey was based in fear; however, it was not fear of bears, but fire. The U.S. government predicted that any bombing of the U.S. by non-Allied forces might result in wildfires. With the shortage of</page><page sequence="9">Marguerite Helmers 53 firefighting personnel and materials, it was incumbent on citizens to be vigilant about the land around them, particularly on the West Coast, given its proximity to the Pacific Theater. It was also prudent to avoid setting fires through negligence. Leisure activities such as camping that resulted in careless forest management could strain an already weakened workforce and potentially aid "the enemy" by destroying farms and villages. Thus, during World War II, the USDA and the Ad Council fought a war within a war: a war on fires. The first poster was titled "Careless Matches Aid the Axis?Prevent Forest Fires" (Rice 276). Other posters produced around this time made use of illustrated propaganda featuring Japanese and German stereotypes. Ronald Rice relates the history of Smokey Bear's arrival on the American scene and consciousness: The idea of using a bear as the symbol of forest fire prevention was conceived by representatives of the Foote, Cone, and Belding advertising agency and the Forest Service. Smokey's first poster, by Walt Disney, appeared in 1944, replacing the initial poster featuring Disney's "Bambi." The 1945 poster, by the noted animal illustrator Albert Staehle, had Smokey in dungarees and a ranger's hat, pouring water on a campfire, with the message, "Smokey Says: Care Will Prevent 9 Out of 10 Forest Fires." (276) According to Morrison, a bear was chosen to deliver the Forest Service's message because he was "a familiar animal" who "looked quite natural standing on his hind legs" (7): Bears live in most parts of the world and are recognized everywhere. Thousands of people visit bears in zoos every year. Many stories are written about bears. Travelling shows and circuses feature trained bear acts. Wild bears live in state and natural forests where people can see them easily. (7) Born from an association with Disney and out of the successful film Bambi (1944), Smokey Bear's image and message also benefitted from the ability to be easily commodified and distributed to multiple audiences. O'Barr points out that today, Smokey Bear is "rated one of the most recognizable figures in America, ranking alongside Mickey Mouse and Santa Claus. 99% of Americans recognize Smokey" (21). Smokey Bear has his own</page><page sequence="10">54 jac merchandise, as well as a website and Facebook page. While the marketing campaign is recognized by all ages, much of the advertising efforts are aimed at children. Children registeringatsmokeybear.com will receive monthly emails from Smokey about forest fire prevention. Coming fu 11 circle from the efforts to end anti-advertising sentiment, the AdCounci 1 and the Forest Service have fully embraced consumerism. Adults and children may purchase t-shirts, pencil sharpeners, baseball caps, tote bags, key rings, fridge magnets, posters, and even holiday ornaments. Thus, Smokey Bear is not only a symbol for stewardship and environmental responsibility, but a symbol organized around human desires for control and mastery of nature. Beyond this, being able to wear the emblems and representations of Smokey bear allow us all to "Get Your Smokey On," in the words of the campaign. In other words, humans can become the bear, while exemplifying one of the finest human attributes: care for others. While the Ad Council refers to Smokey Bear as a "beloved" figure with "timeless appeal" in American culture, there is surprisingly little critical work that addresses the figure of the bear. Mickey Mouse has received far more attention in critical studies of American imagery, most likelyto his obvious commercial nature. Yet, Smokey reveals pathologies of American visual experience, exposing fears and desires and contribut ing to a wilderness imaginary that runs throughout American literature, film, and popular culture. His persistent vigilance against the threat that humans pose to the wilderness exposes the deep-seated conservationist ethic that emerged in the 19th century work of writers such as John Muir: tourists were a threat to the wild and needed careful husbandry (Helmers, "Creating"; Wilson 41). Even Disney Studios claimed that they had to "get wildlife on film before civilization could wipe them out" (qtd. in Wilson 125). Posters created by the Ad Council from 1944 to the present reveal an American relationship to wilderness and assumptions about race, class, and gender. Advertisements are aimed at a leisure class, those who visit the well-mapped wilderness for entertainment. Various visual rhetorical strategies helped position Smokey as an icon in American society and establish the interplay and elision between what is real and what is imaginary between human attributes and bear skin. Smokey is a bear with human characteristics, but he is also reassuringly a construction that can</page><page sequence="11">Marguerite Helmers 55 be manipulated and contained by the frame of the representational space. In the case of Smokey Bear advertisements, the chain of signification does not lead back to ontological, non-human animal bears, but to human desires, rules for behavior, and laws. Before moving ahead, two considerations are apt for a visual rhetori cal examination of the mediated animal. First, what do the animals do within the text? Second, in what way are human readers reflexively constructed by the animal representations? Yet, the fact remains that Smokey Bear, like other advertising spokes-animals, is an anthropocentric construction. His difference from other representations is that he is able to destabilize the human viewer due to his fluctuating animal/human nature. As the early posters demonstrate, Smokey's watchful and accus ing eye poses a question to the viewer, "the human subject who undertakes [the] reading" (Wolfe 569). Smokey is privileged to speak when humans remain silent because he speaks from a position underscored by pathos as well as logos. Rather than limiting our human anthropomorphic tendencies to react to furry mammals with sentiment, Smokey often breaks through the representational frame to reprimand the human viewer. As Wolfe points out in his survey of animal studies, "The literary and philosophical end of animal studies has been interested in . . . identification and sympathetic imagination regarding animals and how they experience the world [and] the intensity of our emotional attachments to them" (569). Smokey's stance differs from that of Disney's creations, who operate in a closed storyworld and do not address the human audience beyond the fourth wall, as if that audience is capable of civic action. Smokey's own nomadic history, in which the name was once given to a real bear in a zoo, adds credence to his ethos. Smokey has "been around the block," we might say. The longevity of his deployment in the public sphere and his history as an effective deterrent to forest fires works to suggest a credible ethos for him as a speaker. From Pathos to Logos The visual history of Smokey Bear posters demonstrate that the creators moved from strategies dependent on pathos to strategies employing logos.</page><page sequence="12">56 jac The first poster, created in 1944, established Smokey as the anthropomor phic, sentient, caring forest steward. Illustrator Albert Staehle founded his career on the creation of animals with human qualities. In his work for the Forest Service and Ad Council, Staehle positioned Smokey at the center of the image. Smokey, wearing dungarees rolled at the ankles, is pouring water from a silver metal bucket onto a smoldering fire; his ranger hat, connoting authority, aligns with his eye, the pail, the water, and?at the bottom of the hierarchy?the fire. A tight circle around the center of the image links the line of Smokey's strong left arm with the pail and his face, therebyestablishinghim as the protagonist ofthe image. His lefteye looks away from the fire, his gaze addressing the audience as "you": Does he accuse? Does he intend us to reflect on his care? As if in answer, the caption reads, "Smokey Says. . . . Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires!" So the viewer is meant to understand that Smokey's words were doubted; the implied "we" of the address was a careless camper and Smokey's gaze is accusatory. Smokey is not endowed with speech, however. He speaks through an unnamed intermediary, one who identifies him in the third person as "Smokey," an omniscient narrator. In the history of the posters, the persistent rhetorical vehicle for conveying Smokey's message is through an absent?as in non-visible?narrator addressing an implied audience, while masquerading as Smokey speaking. Through the use of the third person ("Smokey says"), the message is sent to the audience, an audience ("you") constructed as potential perpetrators of forest destruction (your "care"). While intended as a rhetoric of care, the mode of address could also be a rhetoric of suspicion. If anyone is capable of destroying forests, then humans are always already guilty. "Care" is an appeal to pathos, a feeling for the environment and the non-domesticated creatures that live in the wilderness. Since the utterance "only you can prevent forest fires" is not issuing directly from him through the rhetorical vehicle "Smokey says, 'Only you,'" but is attributed to him, the question remains ofthe degree to which Smokey is sentient and has the power of speech. Following the work of Mikhail Bakhtin and Louis Althusser (as well as Emile Benveniste and Martin Buber), then, we understand that the "you" constitutes not on ly the audience, but Smokey Bear as a subject. It is reciprocal. Smokey</page><page sequence="13">Marguerite Helmers 57 Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires! Figure 2: Smokey Bear image used with the permission of the USDA Forest Service. himself is called into being by the presence of the "you" in the discourse, because it implies "I." The second person functions like Althusser's hailing. It extends an invitation to accept, to recognize the self in the "you" being addressed. The "you" implies, as Bakhtin would note, an answer. That response emerges from the perpetrator and the one who prevents forest fires?both human. "You" can refer to both the friend and the foe, the steward of nature as well as the careless camper. It is a theme that runs throughout the images and that underscores the ambivalent rhetoric of the poster campaign. If the "you" also constitutes an "I," it is establishing a relationship between "I" (bear) and "you" (human); in a moment of interspecies identification, they are "undergoing changes prompted by encounters with other entities" (Cox 23).1 "I" is becoming human, while "you" is becoming animal.</page><page sequence="14">58 jac As if to further emphasize that the audience has been careless, there is the lacuna of the fire. How did this fire come to be? Is Smokey cleaning up after a careless smoker or camper? There is no evidence of camping equipment at the scene; human campers are absent. Viewers may ascertain that the burn isn't "natural," because natural burns do not require the audience to exercise "care." We can also be assured that Smokey has not created this fire himself because the fire was built using improper techniques that Smokey, as steward, would be careful to avoid: it appears to be at ground level rather than in pit; there is an absence of a ring of rocks to act as a fire break; and an abundance of flammable brush surrounds the site. Smokey carries a shovel with him in later images to emphasize both the proper techniques for clearing the area to build the campfire and to further caution that a way to stop a fire from burning out of control is to shovel dirt over it. Here, he has only his pail. A second theme to employ pathos is the creation of a forest family of non-human animals within the world of the poster. Wilson points out that 1950s nature films produced by Disney employed an anthropomorphic narrative that organized animals into "families" or characterized them as "territorial," battling for homeland (13). Such narrative constructions mediated and controlled the relationship between humans and the natural world by construing animals as players in a drama whose plot and characters are familiar to human experience because the situations are drawn from the realm of human emotion and interaction rather than close study of the animals in their environment. Furthermore, the narrative of the animal family inculcated generations of human television viewers into construing the non-human world as organized along human principles. Mediated presentations of animals "tell us far more about our own culture" than they do about the wild, Wilson concluded (13), an option echoed by Baker, as well: [S]entiments about animals are typically projections of attitudes to humans. . . . The contrasting of humans and animals invariably serves as an analogy for the relation of those regarded by a particular society either as insiders or as outsiders. (79) We expect anthropomorphic animated films such as Bambi, The Lion King, and Brother Bear to have the qualities of the imaginary; yet the</page><page sequence="15">Marguerite Helmers 59 imposition of tragic, romantic, or comedicemplotment on natural phenom ena reinforces the distance imposed between human and non-human animal. Non-humans are seen through what Kenneth Burke called "terministic screens," visual experiences organized for the pleasure or education of the human that disclose and conceal the ecology of the wild. Such a move is evident in another early poster, "Another 3 0 Mi 11 ion Acres" (1948). This poster is the first of several decades of forest family images that link Smokey to bear cubs and other creatures?particularly deer and squirrels. It's worth noting that the coyote, wolf, and bobcat are never featured in fire prevention posters, as they were considered pests, dangers to the livestock of ranchers and farmers. Presumably, a public image campaign that urged campers to care for predators was not considered persuasive. Also absent are the less attractive members of the deciduous forests, the pig-like javelina (also known as the collared peccary), muskrat, porcupine, and skunk.2 In the 1948 poster, Smokey is at the forefront of the image, larger, taller, prouder, and more human than the other mediated animals within the frame. He wears his ranger's cap, carries a shovel in his left hand, and is clad in his jeans. He is the mythical and mediated Papa Bear, protecting his family from the red flames that rage on the horizon. Sheltered behind his right shoulder are Mother deer and Baby deer (again, m ining the Bambi theme) and a parental squirrel clasping a baby squirrel tightly. The sense of impending danger is amplified in this poster as the forest family stands between the red skies of fire and the implied audience of careless spectators. In fact, the placard embedded into the bottom of the image addresses the audience, emphasizing through an underscored "you" the awareness that we are "out there," beyond the frame: "Remember? Only you can Prevent Forest Fires!" This statement effectively blocks the exit from the burning forest for the creatures; they are trapped between human and fire. Conversely, the placard bars the entrance to the natural world for the viewer, who is safely outside the frame, beyond the fourth wall.</page><page sequence="16">60 jac Figure 3: Smokey Bear image used with the permission of the USDA Forest Service. In fact, the central image of this poster is the fire itself. Red skies and flames occupy the central axis of the image, their color contrasting strongly with the muted greens, blues, and browns of the woodland trees and brush and non-human forest residents. The 1948 poster is divided in several halves: reading from left to right across the field of burnt forest, we trace a narrative trajectory that promises imminent destruction for the animals; reading top to bottom emphasizes audience responsibi lity, as the placards addressing the audience frame the space; reading back to front (or front to back), the consequences of human behavior are demon strated?the "you" has set the fire. It is an image of division. In 1944, the focus was on the action of care, with Smokey patiently and silently calming a campfire. The audience was offered the opportunity</page><page sequence="17">Marguerite Helmers 61 to establish a relationship with Smokey and emulate his actions of care. In 1948, the message was more urgent and the humans were positioned in a more aggressive relationship to the wild. This is most likely because, after World War II, Americans took to the road. The late 1940s and early 1950s witnessed the rise of the recreational vehicle (RV), the mobile home that allowed Americans to travel in comfort into the wilderness. Hence, by 1948, the direct appeal to the need for responsible stewardship of wild places was more urgent than in 1944. The cognitive element of Smokey Bear's development first appears in 1949, in the poster that presents Smokey as teacher to a younger bear. The visual development of the narrative of this poster is muddled. Although the young bear sits on a tree stump as if learning from a school book while Smokey instructs using the chalk board, the message is not addressed to other bears, but to humans. It relies on our assumptions for its meaning; as human readers, we assume that little bears do not start fires. Smokey, again in the third person, says, "Hold 'til it's cold ... prevent forest fires," but it is without the familiar second person address of "you."An open book of matches punctuates the slogan, providing the reference for the word "it's."3 This image, drawn again by Albert Staehle, complicates the questions of agency and responsibility. It is composed of several layers: first, there is a human hand at the center of the image; second, the hand is framed by the chalkboard, contained by the crafted wood that belongs to the bears in this forest imaginary; third, the chalkboard message is ruled by the bear; and fourth, the entire scene is framed and thereby distanced by the space of the poster that presents the message to the human viewer. Smokey's gaze to the left?away from the chalkboard, the little bear, and the viewer?addresses an absent (human) spectator and audience in an imaginary classroom of the wild. As in earlier work, the human audience is implied, but a difference emerges as the human hand, reduced to a fragment of the full body, encroaches into the world of the bear. Only a right hand is shown chalked onto the blackboard. It holds a match, reinforcing the lesson, "Hold 'til it's cold." Because the hand occupies the space and Smokey's pointer indicates the fingers, it seems likely that the match itself is not dangerous; it is the misplaced action of "not holding" that is the problem.</page><page sequence="18">62 jac SMOKEY SAVS \Jm Hold 'til it's cold... m prevent forest fires Figure 4: Smokey Bear image used with the permission of the USDA Forest Service. Two significant themes depart from this point and make their way into future posters. The first is dismemberment, a theme that pulls Smokey Bear into fragments to the degree that he eventually becomes a detached head in designs that move closer to our present day.4 The second, the symbol-using abilities of the bear, is augmented in television advertise ments that make the bear move and speak. The consistent push toward greater animation of Smokey Bear appears to confirm the will to human power that is invested in his creation. One of the significant themes of the campaign has been the sharing of the skin?or pelt?of the bear. Smokey Bear has been animated in several ways. Balloon versions appear in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and Rose Bowl parade. Costumed mascots appear at local events to interact with children. In the 1950s,</page><page sequence="19">Marguerite Helmers 63 "Smokey" hosted a radio show, starred in "the Smokey Bear Show" on television from 1969-71, and even threw out the first pitch at a baseball game (Morrison 86-87). As part of an ongoing television commercial campaign, Smokey even had a makeover in 2008 to appeal to young adults ("Smokey Bear Returns"). In television commercials, thanks to special effects, Smokey is often seen blurring into the human. For example, a 2008 commercial features two young men in a roadside cafe that looks out over a dry, southwestern landscape. Framed in the picture window near their booth is a smoker who carelessly tosses his cigarette on the ground. Incensed, one of the diners rises from his table, knocks on the window, and accuses the smoker: "Are you trying to start a wildfire?" However, in a reverse shot cut that shows us the diner from the smoker's perspective, it is Smokey Bear in the window. An Icon for All Time and High Times As an American cultural icon such as Mickey Mouse or Barbie, Smokey Bear combines the religious devotional aspect of the orthodox eikon ("to resemble") with the semiotic understanding that he is a nationalist symbolic construct representing a class of American significations: patriotism, loyalty, and personal responsibility. In The Iconography of Nationalism, Dallas Hulsey recalls that Walter Benjamin developed a materialistic and perceptual schema of visuality that activates the icon, makes it real. The icon is thus "auratic," to draw from Benjamin's theory of the icon; it is called into being by the personal and cultural predispositions of the viewer. It is also "highly recognizable, overdetermined and culturally variable" (Hulsey 48). Like Mickey Mouse, Smokey "appeals to children and to the childish aspects of adults" (Hulsey 48). Popular icons such as Smokey Bear "represent model behaviors based on what attracts children and adolescents while attempting to contain adult conduct within childish parameters in the name of protecting youths from allegedly inappropriate adult behaviors" (48). Yet, Hulsey stresses that icons are far from trivial and "include statements about race, class, sexuality, religion, and politics" (49). Hulsey writes that:</page><page sequence="20">64 jac Icons are particularly powerful signifiers because they are immedi ately recognizable and carry complex cultural codes in a compact image. Gregor Goethals comments, "When we designate certain images and objects as 'icons,' we are really asserting that these images and objects are extraordinary in that they embody particu larly important values or even some residue of the sacred. Other wise, why not use the word 'image'?" (4) National icons inspire "faith, devotion, and obedience to a nationalist ideal" (Hulsey 4), just as Smokey encodes patriotic idealism: love and protection of the country. Thus, the icon is a symbol, but beyond its relationship of resemblance and marker of signification, it is important to remember that "the viewer does not stop the gaze at the icon, but extends the gaze through the image to an inner, inscrutable ousia (essence)" (Helmers, "Popular Icons"). In Western culture, the eye is limited to the surface elements of "form, design, texture, and color" (Helmers, "Popular"); however, East ern orthodox tradition tells us that we need to read beyond the frame, that the surface limits our potential emotional, rational, and spiritual response. As Hulsey notes, over time, icons "become domesticated ... as they are cleansed of subversive traits that could interfere with their widespread appeal and ability to shape and manage desire on a mass scale" (3). Yet there was a time in the history of the advertising campaign when Smokey Bear was subversive by intention, drawing from the themes of a rebel 1 ious counterculture. In 1973, actress Joanna Cassidy appeared in a television commercial where she offered a personal view of the value of the forest. She calls the forest "peaceful and quiet, a place where animals play" and urges the viewer to "be extra careful." As she speaks, the camera tightens on her face. At the close of the commercial, she reaches behind her voluminous long hair and pulls her face off. We see her smile crumple into a grimace, as the face and torso of Smokey Bear takes her place. The PSA could have been marked by the same preface that Hunter S. Thompson used in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: "He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man" (xvii). The burdensome, moral skin of the human is lost to the bear. Thompson' s book is marked by several episodes of animal intrusions and its complex counter cu ltural message is echoed by The Milagro Beanfield War and The Monkey Wrench Gang, both of which advocate anti-Establishment acts and both of which, as</page><page sequence="21">Marguerite Helmers 65 mentioned earlier, feature significant defacements ofSmokey Bear icons. Thus, further evidence for the liminalityofthe visual legacy of Smokey emerges: he is animal and human, corpus and corpse, sentient and silent, living and dead. In The Book of Skin, Steven Connor notes that the idea of the upelt" rather than the "skin" induces a kind of horror in the observer, as the Latin wordpelli?eventually yielding^//?is "the dead, the flayed skin": Once scoured away from the body, the human or animal skin becomes simply a hide, deader than a corpse, a corpse's remnant, the corpse of a corpse. (11) It is this sense of horror that ensues from the 1973 PSA, which reverses the order of things: the bear Smokey holds the pelt of the human Cassidy, in a kind of parody of a bear attack that skins the human victim. Such an embedded sense of horror at the human-animal fusion also governs strict rules given to mascots, who are not allowed to ever disrobe in public. One of the official guidelines reads "Costumes should be kept under cover before and after use, particularly when children are around. Smokey's head tucked under a forest officer's arm is shocking to a child" (qtd. in Morrison 82). Conclusion Even this short history of representations tagged as "Smokey Bear" demonstrates the extent to which his presence manages humans while being the construct of human desires. Smokey was selected as the symbol of the forest service because he was "a big animal" and a capable animal more than a "gentle and lovable" one (Morrison 7). The contradictions embodied in Smokey Bear are evident in his famous slogan, "Only you can prevent forest fires." He is both the "I" and the "you" of the utterance, both the one who speaks and the one who is spoken for. Smokey embodies the ambivalent attitudes toward bears that peppered official government policy, advertising and public relations, and popular culture in America for most of the twentieth century. In Alice Wondrak Biel's words, "the narrative of friendship between people and bears was established" in the</page><page sequence="22">66 jac National Park Service publications of the early decades of the twentieth century (4). Here, "bears existed in the narrative to teach a lesson?about fun in the national parks, environmental stewardship, wi Iderness, science, or proper visitor behavior" (4). Representational bears harbored the performing bear tradition. They were put on display in posters, pamphlets, and television where their human behaviors inhabited an animal skin, their very hybridity engendering affection and antagonism. Visual representations of mediated/fictional animals construct spec tators. They bring us together as a public with a shared consciousness. As public icons, they foster a collective consciousness (say, remembrances of Mickey Mouse) and thus embody the power to mobilize that collectivity for social action. A visual rhetoric of animal representations asks why animals can perform these activities better than representations of humans. Uncomfortably, it is because humans feel less threatened by the animal due to the animal' s long history of being embedded in cu ltural texts that serve human interests. Looking at animals empowers humans as spectators and actors. Thus, Smokey in particular performs a civic function as he constructs us as responsible citizens. We are also citizens who have the potential, through ignorance, a sense of entitlement, and pure disregard, to destroy the wild. One of the values of spectatorship in the case of Smokey Bear is recognizing our own human dual nature?our capacity for strong decision making and for poor choices. To echo the work of James Elkins, the power of the Smokey Bear icon is that he stares back. He allows a rhetorical opportunity to consider the ways that human agency and civic action are constructed. His power is not exclusively the result of animal/human hybridity or the use of sentiment in advertising. The bear is able to break the frame from time to time, to step outside the territory of human construction. University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, Wisconsin Notes 1. Cox's work was part of the Becoming Animal exhibit at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, in which visual artists attempted to express the interconnectedness of the becoming animal idea.</page><page sequence="23">Marguerite Helmers 67 2. A series of educational posters was printed in the 1970s by the National Symbols Program (www.symbols.gov), and three of these posters included snakes, insects, and fungi. 3. There are other versions of this image in which the open book on the little bear's lap contains different pictures. 4. NPS badges for naturalists also use the disembodied bear's head as a symbol. Patches worn by the naturalists feature three oak leaves centered on the bear. Works Cited Abbey, Edward. The Monkey Wrench Gang. 1975. New York: Harper, 2006. Baker, Steve.
