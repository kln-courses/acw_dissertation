<plain_text><page sequence="1">GODDESS, EAR, AND METAPHOR On the Journey of Nelle Morton Catherine Keller Maybe "journey" is not so much a journey ahead, or a journey into space, but a journey into presence. The farthest place on earth is the journey into the presence of the nearest person to you. Nelle Morton, The Journey is Home From the Great Above the Goddess opened her ear to the Great Below. Hymn to the Sumerian Inanna We are not lost, though wandering For by your light we come And we are still God's people The journey is our home "Lead On, O Cloud of Yahweh" Nelle Morton's journey continues through the unending network of her influence: as early civil rights organizer and later feminist leader; as beloved seminary professor, international church activist, friend of children; as diffi cult critic and celebrative creator of community; as Goddess advocate, ico noclast, visionary; as faithful, questioning foresister (who did not want to be mother) aglow with curiosity, rage and wonder; and as author embodying all of these dimensions in a text. The Journey is Home took its name from the feminist hymn, "Lead On, O Cloud of Yahweh," a nonsexist rendition of the motif of the Exodus journey. Nelle Morton's collection of essays tracing the metamorphosis of her consciousness during the 1970s, after her retirement from Drew Univer sity, will echo through the future of feminist theology. Arising from a lifelong political engagement, an extraordinary interplay of firsthand experience and depth reflection, this text serves as a primary source for feminist spirituality in or out of the Christian church. Sometimes her discourse feels roughhewn 1 Nelle Morton, The Journey Is Home (Boston: Beacon, 1985). All subsequent page references to Journey will be included in the text.

This quality of rootedness keeps her radical questions, her far-reaching quest, confidently grounded; it is the essence of her originality. However intellectually canny and heuristically powerful, the text never wanders in the way of academic self-preoccupation: it strides firmly along in the authenticity of the author's own journey. This essay will explore Nelle Morton's concept of metaphor, and its relation to her own most profound metaphors: those of"hearing to speech" and of "Goddess." The intertwining of these themes provides a rich matrix for a woman-identified theism. I will contrast Morton's work with that of other theorists of metaphor as well as other theists in order to highlight its unique contribution to the theology of language and the language of the ology. By seeking to articulate some of the systematic links between Nelle Morton's themes of hearing, metaphor and Goddess, we begin to sense the generative theological/thealogical power of her intuitions. The journey into her presence leads us down, through the ear of the Goddess, into a sen sibility that, at this point in history, comes back "up from down under" only through metaphor. Journey into Hearing The Journey is Home is laced together by stories that become metaphors for the journey of all women. It could be likened to Augustine's Confessions as an instance of spiritual autobiography. But unlike that classic prototype, composed by one who confessed "God and the soul, nothing more, nothing at all," Nelle's account is preoccupied neither with God nor with herself. She has no truck with the "spiritual" as an apolitical, aphysical enterprise, like a lonely journey up barren mountains. So her metaphoric moments always illustrate a confrontational, self-enfleshing spirit, suffering the passions and injustices of the human world. She repudiates the vertical thrust of human self-abasement and divine transcendence erected by standard doctrine and spirituality. This difference is at the very heart of her method-her insistent move ment "up from down under." Her quest to relocate "spirituality" (if the word itself can be healed of the traditional stress "down from above") leads her to await "a word we cannot yet speak" (p. 86ff.). Her journey moves her always toward the vulnerability of the others, the actual, physical, suffering ones who require our hearing. From the early civil rights movement, through her work with mentally handicapped children, and finally in her immersion in "the woman movement," she has sought and heard those "down under." Openness to their pain and their hope-as well as her own-fired an indom itable imagination. Such imagination becomes the locus of a dissenting transcendence. This "transcending" (a form she prefers to transcendence)</page><page sequence="3">Keller: Goddess, Ear, and Metaphor 53 refers not to a sphere above and apart, nor to a unilateral divine activity or Word, but to a dynamism of relationship. Rather than "Lord, have mercy" her litany has been "Sisters, we hear your pain."2 In contrast to the Augustinian self, whose isolation is relieved only vertically, Nelle Morton's journey seems to be measured by events of hori zontal interrelation. At these points she hears something fresh, usually though not always in the experience of others, with such epiphanous vitality that it becomes an integral part of herself. Let us note how genuinely self consistent her method is; a consistency based less on methodological self consciousness than upon the intentional congruence of experience and in sight. The very metaphor of"hearing to speech" is language she-literally heard, not language she invented. She recounts listening to a woman in a consciousness-raising group tell her painful life story, seeming to suffer almost physically in the act of narration. Suddenly the woman narrowed her eyes and said to the group, "I have a strange feeling you heard me before I started. You heard me to my own story." From this event, in which a woman knew herself "heard all the way," Morton "first received a totally new understanding of hearing and speaking" (p. 127). Neither the model of an autonomous authorial ego nor of divine inspiration accounts for this sort of revelation. This active hearing brings, through its radical receptivity, a narrative consciousness to the event. The event then carries its meaning beyond itself: in its self-transcending, it becomes metaphor. In other words, her own reconception of hearing comes from a moment of hearing. One could ask whether her work, as it derives from such moments of hearing rather than from her own verbal invention, counts as somehow less original than more sheerly theoretical or poetic texts. Or does its originality lie precisely in this totally new understanding-a creative hearing that foregrounds the speech of those "heard to their own speech," rather than its own last words and final truths? Wouldn't this construe originality less as the property of an individual genius generating impressive products than of a power to release reciprocal creativity in relation? Morton does not just listen: she both hears to speech and so speaks from her hearing. Implicit here is a practice and a theory of communal creativity. The orig inality of Morton's work can only be discerned when we learn not to dislodge theory from practice, individuality from community, speech from hearing. In Nelle Morton's work form and content coalesce. Her theory of meta phoric image comes embedded in a metaphoric discourse. Yet this is no self referential mirror play of tropes upon tropes. Rather, the impact of certain moments of her pain, anger, and disillusionment as well as those of epiphany and reorientation, taught her both the deadening and enlivening capacity of 2 Morton used these words as a litany at the conclusion of her major address to the World Federation of Methodist Women, in Dublin, Ireland (August 21, 1976), right before joining the great march of women protesting their victimization by the Irish war (p. 121).</page><page sequence="4">54 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion images: their power both to bind and to liberate. I turn now to a considera tion of metaphor, in its distinction from image and symbol. Image in Metaphor "The journey of a metaphor," Nelle Morton writes, "includes two ac tivities: the iconoclastic 'shattering' or 'exorcism' of the oppressively 'inadequate or phony image';" and the "transcending to a totally new horizon or perspective that the old horizon kept hidden so long" (p. 152). Here her own textual journey culminates in an essay on metaphoric images, where, in unselfconscious derivation of content from form and form from content, she defines metaphor itself as a journey. Her image correlates fittingly with the etymology of metaphor, as a "transfer," or "carrying beyond." That is, the literal meaning is borne beyond its original context, into a "new horizon." We might argue that the iconoclasm of metaphor is a function of the tension, which may be friction or explosion, between the literal meaning and the new possibilities for meaning opened by the metaphoric transfer. Metaphor always rubs some fresh possibility against some status quo, and thus, by its very nature, will not survive its own dogmatization. Metaphor as Morton understands it is different from the more neutral status of image, as well as the more established status of symbols. To do Morton justice, we must never lose sight of the power dynamics inherent in image and confronted by metaphor. True-live-metaphor challenges those linguistic substructures that sustain the social superstructures, planted as the operative images of earliest infant pedagogy (hence the importance of her study with Piaget, and her work with children). Metaphor seems in her usage to revive the imaginative child within each of us, stirring energies that will not tolerate the child-suppressing, woman-abusing, life-denying pat terns of dominance and subjugation. Morton highlights the revolutionary potential of metaphor when she suggests that the tension of metaphor alters not only perception but also the perceived world; not only language but its referents. She claims that the "institutional sins of war, poverty, pollution, colo nialization, and racism are direct projections of sexist words and images out of a predominantly male-oriented language system" (p. 71). The root image of the dominant male-as warrior, ruler, white overlord, as protector or rapist of women, as Mankind dominator of the earth-constitutes a common sym bolic core for all modes of oppression. Her view should not be mistaken for a monocausal theory of oppression, but an account (common to radical femi nism) of the interlinkage of different structures of social evil, centered around the subjugation of women as the oldest and most pervasive injustice.3 The 3 See Gerda Lerner, The Creation of Patriarchy (New York and Oxford: Oxford Univer sity Press, 1986). Lerner argues convincingly for the derivation of class oppression, slavery and the military state from the subjugation of women's sexuality.</page><page sequence="5">Keller: Goddess, Ear, and Metaphor 55 image of God the Father, according to Morton, is dead as a metaphor-not because of anything intrinsically lethal in the image of a divine male, but because of the imperialism clothing the image in exclusive and absolute truth-claims. Here image becomes idol: "It is not wrong to be partial. The wrongness comes when the partial parades as the whole" (p. 181). Image, her original preoccupation, is "that entity which rises out of conscious and unconscious lives, individually and in community, that may shape styles of life long before conceptualization takes place" (p. 20). Words not only denote, they "conjure images," which are "infinitely more powerful than concepts." Images can be static or alive, deadly or energizing, and inasmuch as they function as unconscious cultural implants they prefabricate our consciousness. Then, the image, itself resistant to control, controls us. The image, one might say, is the sensuous face of human expression. In the image sensory experience in the world has been taken into depth, made the object of imagination.4 Image comes tinged with an indefinite array of emotions, sounds, smells, textures. Though image connotes vision and visualization, one can speak of images as auditory, tactile, indeed as derived from any or all of the senses. (The smell of steaming coffee is not just a literal reminder of previous mornings but an image-capable of being stimulated just by these words evoking the image-of that sharp, misty ritual of invigoration.) More pre cisely, an image is a synaesthetic reality to the extent that we have opened all the senses. For Nelle Morton the imaginal is always rooted in the organic. "Organic speech," she says (drawing on Artaud's concept), "may be de scribed as coming up out of spirit in its most concrete and dynamic move ment and not in its static or cliched state; in metaphoric image and not patriarchal symbol" (p. 98). Perhaps religious language flattens into cliche or hardens into coercion just when it has been cut off from its own organic, sensuous base. There need be no contradiction between "hearing" and "image": for one can hear-and speak-metaphoric images that have arisen from and appeal to any or all of our senses. The sensuality of image has political implications. When the senses are open, people stay attuned to the raw resources of their own experience and thus to their own spiritual authority. Mary Daly, a younger sister-spirit to Nelle Morton, has brilliantly connected the patriarchal denial of the evi dence of our senses to the maintenance of a life-denying "phallocracy."5 If image is the internalization of sensory experience, the imaginative rendering of the actual world, then it is not at the level of image that nature flows into culture. As we know it in the Christian tradition of denaturalization, nature is 4 For example, my image of "mother" is not an inner photo, or even photo album, of my literal mother, but a collocation of experiences of her and of every manner of cultural mother figure, deepened, tormented and extended to carry my most primordial desires for nurture and identity. 5 See especially Mary Daly's Pure Lust (Boston: Beacon Press, 1984).</page><page sequence="6">56 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion translated through images in such a way as to create and maintain the established split from culture. As noted earlier, images function as uncon scious cultural implants, prefabricating our consciousness. The image, itself resistant to control, controls us. So though Morton appears at times to romanticize image, the concept remains thoroughly ambivalent and thus incapable of being falsely idealized. Does she romanticize metaphor? This is a greater temptation, as the metaphoric image-the image living in and as metaphor-has a self-validating and self-relativizing vitality. Metaphoric Tensions An image, we have shown, may or may not take the linguistic shape of a metaphor. Morton (citing Goethe) contrasts the metaphoric and the sym bolic image and assumes that metaphor, by contrast with the more culturally conventional symbol, is "known only in its functioning." "Metaphor is not metaphor unless it is on the way" (p. 154). This movement results from the tension between "vehicle" and "tenor" (I. A. Richards) between image and referent. For instance, between "God" (referent/tenor) and "mother" (vehi cle/image) there is today a lively metaphorical tension; whereas between "God" and "father," a former tension (that of the original iconoclastic role of "Abba") has dissipated, leaving a dead metaphoric residue. The image of God the Father mistakes itself for the divinity-but like a corpse in rigor mortis it has a rigid grip on the cultural psyche. To further clarify Nelle Morton's theory of metaphor, I will draw it into dialogue with that of Paul Ricoeur, in Interpretation Theory: Discourse and the Surplus of Meaning. His influential theory will help us to set Morton's work in contemporary context, and to elaborate key concepts. Also the contrasts that emerge will highlight the importance of Morton's insight into the function of metaphor. "What is at stake in a metaphorical utterance," Ricoeur argues "is the appearance of kinship where ordinary vision does not perceive any relationship." Morton would agree that the metaphor creates a new sense of connection out of terms seen by ordinary vision (patriarchal lenses?) to be unrelated. New meaning, he says, springs up "between the terms that previous systems of classification had ignored or not allowed." In contrast to Morton, Ricoeur's agenda includes no social or structural analysis of those "previous systems." But he rightly argues for a tension theory of metaphor: "Tension metaphors are not translatable, because they create their meaning. This is not to say that they cannot be paraphrased, just that such a paraphrase is infinite and incapable of exhausting the innovative meaning."6 That is, they are neither irrational nor reducible (as in allegory) to any 6 Paul Ricoeur, Interpretation Theory: Discourse and the Surplus of Meaning (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press, 1976), 61, 51.</page><page sequence="7">Keller: Goddess, Ear, and Metaphor 57 particular rational meaning-any logos. This supports Morton's own project. Yet as I will demonstrate, Ricoeur, lacking Morton's association of iconoclasm with metaphor, cannot finally free metaphor from the grip of a disembodied logos. The broad compatibility of Ricoeur's and Morton's theories renders certain areas of divergence especially telling. First, he considers metaphor "the resolution of an enigma," consisting of "reducing the shock engendered by two incompatible ideas."7 That is, metaphor attenuates the very tension that creates it. But Nelle Morton, with her emphasis on the iconoclastic moment, lets the shock come to prominence. If the moment of dissonance with the status quo is cut short, the epiphany is phony. It becomes a case of "premature reconciliation," in the language of liberation theology. Perhaps Ricoeur's grounding in Freud has biased him to the therapeutic lowering of tension, in which adjustment to the limits of (patriarchal) civilization rather than its transformation establishes the equilibrium of "normalcy." Certainly other depth psychology backgrounds, such as that of analytic psychology, associate healing transformation with the raising rather than lowering of tension. The omission of iconoclasm cannot be simply equated with andro centrism. Sallie McFague, who has made valuable feminist contributions to the understanding of metaphor, also focuses on metaphoric construction, with no discussion of the prior explosion. Her work thereby generates less friction than Morton's within the Christian mainstream. Certainly she sug gests promising and politically well aligned alternatives to traditional pa triarchal metaphors (such as the metaphors of God as Mother, Lover and Friend, or the world as God's body). Yet her evasion of iconoclasm supports a certain metaphoric rationalism, allowing her to do what would be impossible for Morton: to virtually identify metaphor with "model."8 As a "metaphor with staying power," model for McFague resembles what Morton means by symbol. Ricoeur helps to clarify the crucial distinction between metaphor and symbol. As in Morton's theory, symbol evokes a more stable order of experi ence. It signifies a heavier weight of past experience and interpretation, operating through a vast hierarchy of metaphors, evolving more slowly in time. Ricoeur traces the link between symbol and the "sacred universe," the natural surround so heavily symbolized in mythopoeic cultures. Symbols, he shows, cannot be extricated from the prelinguistic universe. But with the next step he swerves far from Morton's intuition: "This bound character of 7 Ricoeur, 52, 51. 8 Sallie McFague, Models of God: Theology for an Ecological, Nuclear Age (Phila delphia: Fortress, 1987), 34. Also see my (unfortunately titled) review essay, "The Step Beyond Metaphor," Christianity and Crisis 47 (November 9, 1987): 16.</page><page sequence="8">58 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion symbols," says Ricoeur, "makes all the difference between a symbol and a metaphor. The latter is a free invention of discourse; the former is bound to the cosmos."9 For Morton as well, symbols have this "bound character," but they are less bound to the natural cosmos than to the political universe which interprets nature, including female "nature." An important difference emerges. "Metaphors," says Ricoeur, "are just the linguistic surface of symbols ..." Yet if in his own terms metaphors create their meaning, how can he now derive their very meaningfulness from an a priori symbolic "reservoir of meaning"?'0 Perhaps the view of metaphor as shock-absorber itself reduces metaphor to its surface. Perhaps metaphor, if drained of its tension, becomes super ficial. Ricoeur not only ignores iconoclasm in this context, but also image. Might it be that without the sense of the volatile image enfleshing itself as metaphor, the iconoclastic function is necessarily lost? As James Hillman puts it: "the true iconoclast is the image itself."' The latter statement may ignore metaphor. Nonetheless it is through image, as an appearance of the depths on the sensuous surface, the face of things, that Nelle Morton came to metaphor. Though she does not elaborate this distinction, symbol for her would be an a posteriori, cumulative reality; the symbolic reservoir, once constituted of metaphoric images, would then serve as a fund for future metaphors. But for her image connects metaphor to its own symbolic life, past and future. Thus metaphor, unbound and yet connected, can by its sheer vitality twist, challenge, and unhinge the dominant symbolic system of a culture. The difference between Nelle Morton's perspective and Ricoeur's dra matizes itself when he claims: "Metaphor occurs in the already purified universe of the logos, while the symbol hesitates on the dividing line between bios and logos."12 Thus after all the metaphor becomes a disem bodied word. Obviously this purified universe of the logos (purged of body, nature, suffering?) is just that theolinguistic world to which Morton discerns an alternative in metaphor itself, as it arises out of women's hearing each other to speech. Of course metaphor for her is logos, word-but precisely as arising from bios, life. If the "primordial rootedness of Discourse in Life," which Ricoeur attributes to symbol, seems closer to the character of Mor ton's metaphor, this is no merely semantic difference. For to trim the roots away from metaphor, to cut off its earthy origin in the loam of life being lived, is to dislocate our own life stories. Metaphors dangle their roots-muddy with our life-situations, our body, our cosmos. Otherwise they lack the sensuality of image (as does Ricoeur's theory). For if we look for the tie that 9 Ricoeur, 61, 64. 10 Ricoeur, 69. 11 James Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology (New York: Harper, 1975), 8. 12 Ricoeur, 59.</page><page sequence="9">Keller: Goddess, Ear, and Metaphor 59 binds word to life only in the established symbol, with its susceptibility to institutional purgation and self-perpetuation, then doesn't a spirituality of the status quo threaten to overwhelm the vigor of spirit? Hearing and Metaphor How might we reconstruct the connection between the structure of metaphor and the metaphor of "hearing"? Though in some sense metaphor creates the conditions of its own reception, it cannot be said to "hear." Metaphor is what emerges when we are heard to our own speech. If metaphor is not to leave us stranded on the smooth surfaces either of discursive logos or of a purely visual image, we need to remember the bodiliness of hearing-indeed, its belonging to an ear. Suzanne Langer lends a clue to the relation between hearing, the ear itself, and the origination of language in metaphor. Unlike the sense of sight, which can annihilate its object "by a wink or a turn of the head," auditory impressions move further into consciousness and resist being selectively screened out. "Since noises have this intrinsic and commanding interest, and the ear cannot be closed, they were peculiarly well suited to become 'free' items ... and to be utilized by the imagination in sheer play."13 Metaphor for Langer is the law of linguistic life, arising out of the free imaginative play of humans both early in the species and in childhood. The communal celebration of naming, she argues, illustrates how metaphor is not an embellishment of a language of utility but the primordial utterance. Communal festivity is the "force that makes language essentially relational."14 Hearing-ear-being here-being near: an onomatopoetic earful reso nant with this journey into "the presence of the nearest person to you." But what in particular does hearing have to do with the history and presence of women? Certainly the ear is quite literally-to the details of its membranous canals and subtle differentiation between inner and outer-gynomorphic. It physically homologizes the vulva. And psychosocially women have certainly played the role of the hearing ones-privately hearing men to their public logos. More primordially, women have heard babbling infants to their orig inal speech. But Morton is above all interested in hearing as a strategy for lifting the silence of women under patriarchy. "It is killing women not to be heard," wrote Morton in 1971 (p. 30). At this moment many white feminists are coming to consciousness of how we ourselves have failed to hear black women to their own speech. Morton herself was ahead of most feminists in her grasp of the race/gender connec tion (cf. p. 196ff). Struggling to get to the bottom of our own racism, our own 13 Suzanne Langer, Philosophy in a New Key: A Study in the Symbolism of Reason, Rite and Art (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1942), 130. 14 Langer, 141 (emphasis hers).</page><page sequence="10">60 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion assumption of privilege and power, we do at least come to a better under standing of how the systems of dominance work; of how they inhibit our open hearing. Is hearing dangerous because it leaves the hearing self as well as the heard self different? One does not hear the other without being altered by the event. This does not mean that to hear me is to conform to my desires or to agree with my opinions. But if the self is essentially relational, then it is no separable essence that precedes and supersedes the relationship. In the encounter we become part of each other-which means nothing can remain quite the same. A dream of Nelle Morton's dramatizes this relational structure of the open self. She is back in Montreat leading a seminar, and in the audience were many women who had once resisted her ideas. "When I started to say goodbye all of them rose to go with me. 'But you can't,' I insisted, 'I am going far away.' 'Oh, but we can,' they replied in unison, 'for we are a part of you. Today you have owned us. Together we will go where none of us has ever been before'" (p. 184). If I take you in through that openness for which the ear is both metaphor and embodiment, you may be helped to your own speech-but so will I in my turn. So Nelle Morton herself was heard to speech about "hearing to speech" through the communal action of hearing other women to speech, who named the act as it occurred. These echoing layers of relation reflect the dismantling of the subject-object barrier. Yet confusion-any fusion of self and other, especially as we find in heterosexual coupling or parent-child relations-remains incompatible with Morton's sense of"our woman selves." "I do not have to receive my identity or renew it through another gender, be the representative of that gender a minister, father, boss, professor, col league, husband or male lover," she declares in the context of proposing Goddess as a source of female self-esteem (p. 165). Thus it is crucial that Morton's concept of "hearing" is forged in the crucible of women's rela tionships with other women, particularly in nondyadic, communal struc tures. Her work identifies the classic masculine "speaking to hearing" as a coercive inversion; the reversal of "hearing to speaking" carries us back and forward. The raising of women's consciousness through using our hearing power now for each other, and no longer primarily for men and children, releases at the same time a consciousness of self, an ability to hear ourselves. If we know our selfhood as intrinsically inseparable from our relational worlds, the self hearing cannot be a mode of solipsistic introversion. Hearing, let us imagine, is rooted in a depth-dimension: "the Goddess opened her ear to the Great Below." We may construe this depth as a mode of self-relation. That is, we thrive not by emulating masculine ideals of autonomy, but, as we overcome servile self-giving by applying the relational skill of empathetic hearing to ourselves, to our own others. So such self-relation is no reflexive self knowing, like the Cartesian self-consciousness, but rather the relation of the</page><page sequence="11">Keller: Goddess, Ear, and Metaphor 61 present Self to that which in its own margins, fringes, or depths, is experi enced as Other. Goddess as Metaphor This self-relation may allow us to trace a connection between Nelle Morton's fierce commitment to community and her unabashed affirmation of her own visionary experiences. During the seventies she had a series of visions that led her to name that Other-in-Self "Goddess." These experi ences emanate with a stunning spontaneity from her meditative practice of active imagining in which her own depths could take metaphoric shape. She is adamant that such experiences of the appearance of a Goddess-figure are not to be explained away as dreams, of the day or night variety. This is real presence. She repudiates just as firmly any attempt to grant the metaphoric image an external reality, an object coming to her from above and so requiring "worship" (p. 150). That which appears is neither subjective nor objective but really present-as live metaphor. So even in the case of the Goddess image, Nelle is not heralding the emergence of a new symbol system, let alone the recrudescence of an archaic one, but rather listening to the current metaphoric field of feminist spirituality. "God the Mother, or the Goddess tends to be transparent, to make herself dispensable in such a way that in time we will be compelled to seek a totally different way of speaking of reality" (p. 143f.). Evidently Nelle imagines a self-deconstructing logos of Goddess, inasmuch as it becomes logos at all, and therefore a mythos that resists founding out of itself any permanent symbol system. Besides, such a symbol system could only be contained in a new world order, at which point the iconclastic energy of the image would need with special vigilance to turn upon its own symbolic forms. If her central concern with iconoclasm is not lost, there is then little ground for suspecting Morton of a too high, a too normative view of metaphor. To idealize any particular metaphor would be to attenuate its tensive and self-relativizing force. Something metaphorically at once unbinding and spellbinding happens when Nelle writes of the Goddess: "As I let go and opened myself to her, in she swept suddenly through the left side of the windows in front of me ..." (p. 162). Depending on our degree of investment in patriarchal symbolism, it may be the iconoclasm or the epiphany which most affects us. But such a metaphoric appearance of deity in female image is not "just the linguistic surface" of a symbol. Indeed the phenomenology of the experience itself is at first less linguistic than visionary-the encounter with the living image. As it carries with it its own depth, and carries the participant into that depth, it has the power to shake (at least for the moment of disclosure) the grip of the symbol system of masculine metaphors. And it comes cosmologically rimmed; it presents a real, if nonliteral, space for a drama which includes a spider and a river of blood, thus evoking both female and planetary nature.</page><page sequence="12">62 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion So before the Goddess image can "usher in the new reality," the meta phor may have a shattering effect, undermining God the Father and his various secular avatars. Often women feel, most uncomfortably, the ico noclasm but still no epiphany. Morton herself was above all interested in the iconoclastic function of the Goddess image, and until the last, asked us to try that metaphor in undiluted form for a while. 15 The politics of the Goddess converge with the politics of metaphor itself, as a creative affront to the fixities of cosmic paternalism and of all its autocratic attempts to block the open journey. The experience of the metaphoric images precedes that of the meta phoric meaning. The horizon seems to recede, even as we journey toward it. Morton wrote from the standpoint of an always incomplete journey, an in finite hermeneutic. As there is no home apart from the journey, no goal apart from the process, so then a certain proleptic suspense is of the very nature of metaphor-of its tensive dynamism. The Goddess image may arouse in women not only the dread of losing any solace we might have found in our father religions, but a dull ache at our inability to experience the sacrality of woman. This alienation from the potential of our own "woman selves" and thus from our potential for metaphor, only intensifies the ache. This ten sion-like the space held by the hands of Giacometti's "Woman Holding a Void"-does not dissolve into literary lightness. It threatens any established meaning. "What if" asks Nelle, "when you take the sexism out of God language, you have nothing left? What then?" (p. 223). She does not answer the question. If this journey is home, it offers no nostalgic homecoming. Nostalgos-the Greek for the pain of missing home (Heimweh)-motivates the heroic, Odyssean ego to return home to the waiting wife and the women in waiting. Nelle Morton's metaphorically induced pain inverts the dynamic of nostalgia. It opens always into the future. Yet this is a future of presence, the presence of the Other, the presence of the Self, experienced in the sacrality of relation: "the journey into presence." Metaphor, so experienced, leads ineluctably to the con ceptual space traditionally occupied by theological anthropology-reflection on the nature of the self in the light of the divine. Goddess, Hearing, and Theistic Reconstruction How can we address the theological dimensions of such presence? It parallels and inverts, quite inadvertently but not accidentally, Karl Barth's 15 Her final public speech, in the overflowing chapel of the Claremont Colleges on March 24, 1987, was titled "Perception and Image at the Root of Feminism." Proceeding from the premise that all of us are affected by and responsible for patriarchy, she admonished us to let go of images which are nostalgic and not redemptive; to realize that for women the preponderance of images has a dangerously negative effect; and to try "Goddess," or "God/ She" for a while-not settling for compromises like "Mother/Father God" or even "God/ ess," which, she argued, have no iconoclastic force.</page><page sequence="13">Keller: Goddess, Ear, and Metaphor 63 theological anthropology. Though selfhood is in a certain sense relational for him, he presents as the generous act the "self-declaration" of the speaker as a means of "penetration" to the hearer. For humanity as well as for God, speaking, not hearing, is that which is given "for the sake of the other." Morton's sense of presence bears some resemblance to the theism of Martin Buber ("the extended lines of relations meet in the eternal Thou");6 or that of Thomas Altizer's "total presence." Though she herself finally preferred to call her thought theopoetics (after Amos Wilder) rather than theology, we only give her her due by explicating certain implications of her thought for the discipline of theology. Nelle Morton's specifically theological radicalism attaches to two meta phoric moments, that of hearing and that of Goddess. In concluding, we need to attend to the way their joint iconoclastic force facilitates the recon struction of theism. The theological forms and contents of the Goddess metaphor remain open and indeterminate. Morton knows, along with other advocates of feminist spirituality, that one cannot just switch the apparatus of patriarchal "worship" to some "Yahweh with a skirt." Therefore the moment is of great import when she realizes that neither the author of Genesis (In the beginning was the word) nor Goethe's reconstruction (In the beginning was the deed) got it quite right. According to Morton, "In the beginning was the hearing." Of course the phrase-like all of her hearing-phrases-jars ordi nary syntax in its originality. The dynamism of a gerund can never compete for the crispness of grammatic closure with the substantive. And this is just the point: if in the beginning is the hearing, if as she puts it earlier (before she systematically avoids the use of the male term God) we encounter "God as a great hearing one," the cosmos slips out of the grip of a gigantic foreclosure. The beginning, in her reading, retains its beginningness. For if God is not someone telling us to be, and what to be, then history can no longer mean His story, a divine script running more or less-with the slip of original sin-according to providential direction. Rather, if "the more divine act is hearing to speech rather than speaking to hearing" (p. 54f.) then the sponta neity with which we as human speakers articulate ourselves becomes funda mental to the course of cosmic history. Thus she notes the reduction by logos of speech to "one-way relationship," and the teamwork of logos with tech nology to control and manipulate. Only the "far more radical divine aspect of hearing" might liberate from the unilateralism of traditional theology and its secularized methods for colonizing the world. Or rather, liberation would occur as we let ourselves be healingly heard, by each other and in those depths where we encounter wisdom.

Clark, 1937), 75.</page><page sequence="14">64 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion cedes and supercedes logos. That is, spirituality no longer means waiting for God to speak and to act, normally a rather futile posture. Much faith has been broken in this passive despair, in which one depends upon the Father to take care of us and by His Voice direct us. Switching the image of a mother into this model would hardly improve matters. And just as much faith has been falsified at this point-straining and failing to hear the Word, one dubs in various voices of institutionalized authority, ranging from canonized Scrip ture, through ecclesial figures and doctrines, to one's own superego. The novelty of Nelle's theologem of the divine hearing should not be underestimated. It alters the entire sense of prayer, liturgy, and the opera tion of the divine will. "Hear our prayer," of course, has always been an important refrain of Christian piety, fitting uneasily with the doctrines of an all-controlling deity. Nelle Morton allows us to take the divine hearing seriously. But the prayer does not then make sense as a request for God to do what God otherwise might not do. It may be superseded by the varieties of meditation, centering and visualization Morton's story reveals, and by modes of communal attunement to sacred presence and a channelling of collab orative energies. To push this theological speculation a bit further than Nelle Morton did or would, there is no reason to think that the wisdom in the universe does or can operate by way of efficient causes, that is, by a mechanical action of will to produce unilateral effects. The notion of a cosmic hearing, unlike that of a God whose speech is action, does not demand any efficient causation. The contribution of process theology enters at this systematic juncture. It has framed a plausible set of arguments for imagining the divine activity as efficacious not through coercive-mechanical but through persuasive teleological means. Thus the will of God takes the shape of "lures to novelty," or "initial aims."17 Nelle Morton's intuition does not fit easily, however, even with the doctrine of initial aim, which is perhaps the best constructive alternative among contemporary theisms to traditional understandings of divine power. The initial aim is the individualized, momentary immanence of the divine in the world; that is, it is the deep purposefulness in the universe, as it makes itself felt in the final cause appropriate to each momentary individual event. If it makes a difference, it is only by a preconscious appeal to the spontaneity of the emergent subject-so it comes up into consciousness clothed in our own subtle impulses, as perhaps the inner voice, body wisdom, or communal sensibility. It is an appeal to what is possible for the moment. This initial aim is said to take place at every moment, imposed however only as possibility. Whether or not one aim is accepted into the self-creation of the individual at 17 These are technical terms that process theologians have drawn from Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: Free Press, 1928), 77.</page><page sequence="15">Keller: Goddess, Ear, and Metaphor 65 that moment, the deity always offers another one, "the best for the im passe."18 The next moment, which is never precisely the same self as the previous, may or may not embrace its new possibilities. But transformation goes on willy-nilly, as in the process-relational vision, the mutual influence between all beings is incessant, and cooperates with the perpetual flux of reality. My point here is not to extol the virtues of process ontology. Even in a relatively depatriarchalized vision such as this one (if patriarchal theology entails an all-dominant deity whose logos and will control reality) some serious reimagining would need to take place in order to accomodate Nelle Morton's metaphor of the great Ear at the heart of the cosmos. For the initial aim translates readily and not accidentally into logos-language. 19 That is, the discourse of suggestion, or persuasion, while noncoercive, still implies a deity incessantly sending out directives, a memo a moment, instructing actual entities in their best advisable course. Again, the image of a deity who like father always knows best. The process metaphor remains controversial and helpful for its radical relationalism, whereby the divine changes in response to the world. So if the initial aim could be heard as the presence in each individual of that wisdom who/which hears us to our own human speech, interesting alterations would occur. Could one speak so directively of aim anymore, for instance? The divine depth, which might indeed hear us before we hear ourselves, would be soliciting our own imaginative response to the total matrix of relational events rather than attempting to persuade us to do an alien will. The lure would be to learn to heed the needs, the sufferings, the impulses and desires configuring our worlds and then to speak for ourselves; to experience the divine wisdom as more curious than directive, as knowingly hopeful but not telling us how to live our lives. Not a deity withholding valuable information, rather a sort of infinite forcefield of feeling consciousness which can only appeal to us up through the depths of our own interpretive systems.20 18 Whitehead, 244 (his emphasis). 19 John Cobb, Christ in a Pluralistic Age (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1975), systematically identifies the initial aim with the cosmic Logos of early patristic Christology, and so cannot, even with an explicit affirmation of inclusive language, envision any nonmasculine alternative (such as Sophia) for the second person of the trinity. 20 Such a revision of initial aim might soften some of the overlay of anthropomorphic (andromorphic) theism which still besets process theology. Moreover, a lighter, firmly deliteralized ontology of the divine lure might better support the intuition Morton shares with Whitehead: that metaphysical and theological language consist of"metaphors mutely appealing for an imaginative leap" (p. 4). Would this represent a move from ontology to ontopoetics, from theology to theopoetics? Perhaps. Yet to call something, i.e., the deity, a metaphor, is not to relinquish all truth claims or ontological references, but to acknowl edge that we spin such language in the darkness of an infinitely complex universe, and out of the contexts of our endlessly distorting socializations.</page><page sequence="16">66 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Wisdom at the Heart of the Universe At this moment in history we may well choose with Nelle Morton to refer to that mysterious, self-centering field as Goddess. She never intended any dogmatic monism of naming: this would contradict the perpetual ico noclasm of the metaphor and so render Goddess an idol after all (pp. 173, 196). Yet-whether out of expedience or versatility-I find I do not use the term Goddess with anything like the public, liturgical persistence she hoped for. She herself drew upon many other metaphors for deity, most of them biblical-"Wisdom, Spirit, Movement, Tongues of Fire, Dove" (p.84). In her spirit we must each consult the wisdom at work in ourselves for linguistic strategies appropriate to our situations. If this wisdom is truly immanent in the individual, then the way in which it/she gets inside of us is akin to the way the universe gets inside of us. Perhaps this metaphor only lives when we are grounded in our embodied self-hearing, aware of our location in the world and of the shifting matrix of events, to which we also must shift in response. The energy is world energy, not divine pressure. The wisdom is divine then not in the sense of some supernatural revelation from an ontologically separate source, but of a cosmic hearing which meets my hearing: a communion of singing silences. Consider which sort of person seems wiser-the one who gives sage advice, or the one in whose presence we discern our own path? The deity, the Goddess, suggests an anthropomorphic metaphor for a cosmic process, yet one in which the wisdom of the whole addresses us as our own wisdom. Thus as Nelle Morton stresses, like Carol Christ, Naomi Goldenberg or Mary Daly, the Goddess is metaphor for our Selves. But the self, because it is unclosed, is never just the same old self; if it is always in transformation, new, not yet conscious input is streaming in from the breadth and depth of reality. A theistic perspective, to which Morton still would seem to subscribe if one couples her talk of the cosmic wisdom with that of the Goddess, could experience the deepest centering processes of our selves as those of the universe, and therefore not strictly-not in any discrete way our own. By the time it becomes image, and well before it becomes word, it has become our own, whether we experience it as self or other; it has been clothed in the imagery and language familiar enough for us to process. Just what, if anything, wears the clothing? This is of course neither male nor female, as it has no anatomy apart from that of the universe; personal imagery picks out those facets of our transformation most relevant to the present experience. Self-relation here is not separable from relation to the whole, and the whole not separable from its own transcending center. Does this theism that I am deriving from Nelle Morton's insight collapse after all into an exhaustive immanence? Not quite. I may participate in this deeper wisdom, and you may; and it is surely more forthrightly internalized by nonhuman creatures. But it is never just my own immanent depth, or</page><page sequence="17">Keller: Goddess, Ear, and Metaphor 67 inner self, nor is it ever, as argued above, identical with what already is. It creates the space in which something new can occur. So it is "transcending" in the sense that it also is immanent in the experience of everyone and everything else; and that it always pushes "up from down under," beyond what is given and established. It moves through the body, as Morton wanted so much to emphasize, but is not-nor is the body-reducible to physical mechanics. It moves with the voice of the prophets-as Elohim, whose nongendered plurality appealed to her (p.73)-up through the suffering of the downtrodden. So she is right to object to the unnamed theologian who said that women can't have it both ways, organic and transcendent. In Nelle Morton's work the depth of immanence at which we hear and are heard gives birth to the new image, the new word, the metaphor that moves not mountains but people and peoples. And this birth is always a movement of transcendence: the dove ascending. "The womb-tomb," her transformation of old Noah's arc, "ejected its own dove-spirit" (p. 90). Yet finally, "transcendence is no longer the issue. But healing the web of life is" (p. 216). Out of the deep hearing and heeding that heals our interconnec tions, fresh images are born. If"the farthest place on earth is the journey into the presence of the nearest person to you," then it follows that we may find ourselves at home in the farthest places. Nelle Morton calls us to a journey at once intimate and global; it always begins where we are and goes where we haven't been. And along the way we will continue to encounter her insights placed like the marks of a pathfinder by the side of the trail. Her metaphors and the concepts they carry will continue to hear us to our own speech; as indeed by reading and remembering her words and work, we continue to hear her to hers.</page></plain_text>
