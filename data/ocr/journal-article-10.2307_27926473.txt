NUMBERS 3-4 ? 1997 A Chalcolithic Burial Cave in Peqi'in, Upper Galilee vi Gal Howard Smithline Dina Shalem Israel Antiquities Authority In the course of road construction at Peqi'in, Upper Galilee (Fig. 1; grid ref. 18135 26440), a unique Chalcolithic burial site was revealed in a geologically active cave. A salvage excavation was subsequently conducted there on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority.1 The cave is located on a hill sloping down to the east to the Peqi'in valley; its original entrance, on the face of this slope, has been blocked from the inside and the outside for millennia and is indiscernible. Stratigraphy The cave (length: 17 m.; width: 5-7 m.) consists of three units situated on three levels, sloping down from east to west. A corridor, currently full of debris and thus impenetrable, led from the entrance to the upper unit (length: 4.5 m.; width: 6 m.; height: 4 m.), whose eastern part is, likewise, buried under debris and ceiling collapse. This unit was raised, levelled and partially paved with local unworked stones, upon which ossuaries were placed. A stone platform was built on its southern side, while its western side was delimited by a 1.5 m. high terrace wall. A niche in the 1 The excavation, which took place from mid-May to August 1995, was supervised by the authors and included the following participants: A. Aharoni, Y. Alexandre, M. Avi'am, H.

Below these bones there were additional groups of bones intentionally laid in ordered fashion, similar to the fashion of reinterring bones in ossuaries. This suggests an earlier stage of secondary burials. The middle unit (length: 3 m.; width: 4.5 m.; height: 1.2 m.) slopes sharply into the cave, with a 2 m. difference in height between its upper eastern end and lower western side. Here too, stone built terraces, which levelled sections of the unit, were used for the placement of ossuaries and burial jars. The lowest part of this area was delimited by a low terrace wall. West of this wall is the lowest, innermost and largest unit of the cave. This area is irregular in shape (maximum length: 6.5 m.; maximum width: 5.5 m.; maximum height: 2 m.). A karstic depression on the cave floor was intentionally filled with soil and stones in order to raise, and thus unify, the level of the cave floor. In the southern and northern corners there were stone-built platforms. A variety of objects ? mostly ossuaries and jars, some of which had calcified as a result of karstic activity ? were found on these platforms. Above the south-western end of this unit, 2 m. higher than the floor, there is an additional loft-like area which was also used for ossuary and jar burials. This area was most affected by the geological activity at the site and was almost totally covered by flowstone, stalagmites and stalactites. Probes excavated in the middle and lowest units exposed debris, floors composed of small stones and ash levels, indicating two phases of use prior to the predominant Ghassulian burial phase. The earliest material, uncovered on the very bottom beneath the fill material, may be dated to the Wadi Rabah cultural horizon. Much more prominent is a post-Wadi Rabah, but still pre-Ghassulian, phase, characterised by numerous bow-rim jars, holemouth jars, large V-shaped bowls and churns. It is assumed that the cave was inhabited seasonally during these earlier phases. Later, in the Ghassulian phase of the Chalcolithic period, the cave was transformed into a burial place, from which most of the finds originated. Shortly after the final burial, but still within the Chalcolithic period, the cave was violently robbed. The chaos encountered in the cave upon its discovery demonstrates the intense nature of the robbery, which, except for a number of objects which were found in situ, left the cave in total disorder. During the centuries following the robbery, the karstic activity increased, producing hundreds of stalactites and stalagmites which covered ossuaries, burial jars, bones and other objects. This p?trification process created numerous formations, encompassing ossuaries, broken vessels and skeletons in accumulations of various shapes and sizes (Fig. 2). The objects associated with this phase of the cave were utilised for burial purposes only. Ossuaries The ossuaries, all made of clay, were of a variety of types and shapes. The majority consist of a rectangular box with a flat base, sometimes with four or six legs,</page><page sequence="4">148 . GAL, . SMITHLINE AND D. SHALEM Fig. 2. Petrified objects accumulated in and a separated gabled lid (e.g. Fig. 3). The box and lid were fired as one unit, but were subsequently string-cut while 'leather hard'. In most of the ossuaries a series of small corresponding horizontal handles was placed on the boxes and the lids to facilitate their being tied together. The fa?ades of these lids are in the shape of flat plaques with human and occasionally zoomorphic faces, either painted or with applied features, as well as three-dimensional, naturalistically sculpted human heads (e.g. Fig. 4). Another common type of ossuary is a closed unit, usually with four or six legs. At least one ossuary had eight legs. The openings are placed on the rear sides of the ossuary and the fa?ades have prominent noses and eyes, either sculpted or painted. This type of ossuary is common to the coastal plain, of which those of Azor are the best known representatives.2 Haderah has hitherto been commonly accepted as being its northernmost limit.3 A few of the ossuaries are open rectangular boxes with large horizontal handles or a series of pierced holes along the edges, indicating that a cover ? probably made of some kind of organic material ? had been fastened to them. Most of the ossuaries are painted in a variety of red geometric patterns and have mat impressions of various types on their base. 2 J. Perrot: Une tombe ? ossuaires du IVe mill?naire ?

Most of the jars have large pierced handles for carrying the jar and similar small handles for the purpose of attaching a cover. Some were moulded with female breasts; others were painted with red stripes. Several jars have a high trumpet base with 'windows', similar to contemporary fenestrated high-footed bowls. A few jar lids were found, some of which had been fired as a single unit with the jars and Fig 4 0ssuary lid with three-dimensional string-cut while 'leather hard', as in the human features, first type of ossuaries mentioned above. Other jars are made of dark clay with basalt inclusions and have a plastic rope decoration, identical to the type known from Chalcolithic sites in the Golan4 (Fig. 5). 4 C.

High-Footed Bowls These vessels, very common in the cave, usually consist of a high conical leg with 'windows', carrying a V-shaped bowl (Fig. 6). Many are decorated with a variety of red painted patterns, reminiscent of contemporary pottery from the northern coastal plain.5 The external surface of a few of the bowls portrayed human facial features with sculpted noses and painted eyes, or even fully painted faces, down to the eyelashes. At least in three cases skulls were found inside these bowls, and in a number of instances soot was evident. It seems, therefore, that this type of bowl played a major role in the burial customs practised in the cave. Small Vessels This group consists of small jars, V-shaped bowls and goblets, reminiscent of the more elongated cornets typical of the Chalcolithic period.6 Also found were jugs 5 R. Frankel and R.

Noteworthy are one long standard, one short standard (Fig. 7) and two chisels. All of these objects are comparable in shape to the Nahal Mishmar hoard.8 Flint Objects and Stone Vessels The number of flints is not large and consists of few types. Of these, approximately two dozen perforated disks, similar to those found in the Golan, should be mentioned (Fig. 8). In addition, several maceheads made of a variety of stones were found, as well as fragments of basalt bowls on fenestrated bases, one of which is unusually large. These vessels are commonly found throughout the country during the Chalcolithic period.9 Fig. 7. Short bronze standard. Fig. 8. Perforated flint disk. 7 M.

SHALEM Figurines The head of a small ivory figurine (Fig. 9), in the Beer Sheba style,10 was found in the debris of the lowest unit. Small holes were drilled in the top of the head to enable the attaching of hair. About ten 'violin-shaped'figurines of various sizes were found (e.g. Fig. 10). Some were pierced and quite small, apparently serving as charms or amulets. One of the figurines has female breasts, similar to a figurine from Gilat.11 Fig. 9. Ivory figurine head. Fig. 10.

This is the first time fully detailed human features are found on ossuaries, including not only a large plastic applied nose, but also nostrils, eyes, ears, mouth, teeth and beard. Such heads were found on ossuaries and high-footed bowls. This is the first time that Chalcolithic burial customs provide evidence of iconography personally related to the deceased by specifying gender or other special characteristics. One ossuary with twin anthropomorphic portrayal on its fa?ade has been found, for example. Moreover, it seems justified to claim that the artistic development of figurative sculpture shows a chronological progression from early, realistically detailed faces to later symbolic representation. Fig. 11. Three-dimensional sculpted ceramic heads. Preliminary Conclusions The large quantity of bones, ossuaries and jars gives rise to a number of possible interpretations: either that the cave was in use for an extended period within the Chalcolithic period and served a local population, or that for a shorter time, it functioned as a central burial site for an extended population of several villages.</page><page sequence="10">154 . GAL, . SMITHLINE AND D. SHALEM Preliminary results of C14 dating seem to support the possibility that burial continued in the cave for a few centuries in the fifth millennium B.C.E. The possibility of its being a sacred reinterment site for a widespread non-sedentary population may also be proposed. The finds reflect the existence of a high technological and artistic level, expressing a rich spiritual life. The sculpted pieces were undoubtedly created by artists of quite singular talent and technical ability; such standards could only be the product of a well-established and developed culture. Where, then, were the settlements of this culture located? No major Chalcolithic site in the vicinity of Peqi'in has yet been discovered, although judging from the fragility and large size of the ceramic vessels, the existence of such a village in present-day Peqi'in should be expected. Little, in fact, is known at all of the Chalcolithic period in the mountains of Upper Galilee.12 As stated above, the iconography in the Peqi'in cave presents the full artistic range, from naturalistic portrayal to abstract configuration. If this range may be defined as a chronological development, and not merely as a different, but contemporary, stylistic approach, then the realistically sculpted heads may be a representation of an earlier stage of the Chalcolithic period. Thus, the earliest stages of the Chalcolithic period should, perhaps, be sought in the Galilee, contrary to common knowledge. As above-mentioned, all the finds, with the exception of the sculpted heads and new types of ossuaries, are familiar from other sites. For the first time, all of the regional Chalcolithic sub-cultures ? from Gilat and Beer Sheba in the Negev, through the Judaean Desert, and northwards through the Jordan Valley to the Golan in the east and the coastal plain to Byblos in the west ? are found in a single context. Moreover, we may, in this vein, posit the existence of a hitherto unknown Galilean contribution to Chalcolithic regionalism. Additional excavations are necessary to further delineate this culture. The coexistence of the characteristics of the various regional sub-cultures in the Peqi'in cave provides a unique opportunity to re-examine the relations among these regions during this period. Although the study of the Peqi'in cave is as yet in its initial stages, this cave without doubt possesses rare scientific potential to provide us with a better understanding of the Chalcolithic period and its culture. 12 R.
