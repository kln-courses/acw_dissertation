<plain_text><page sequence="1">5. LAPITA AND ITS AFTERMATH: THE AUSTRONESIAN SETTLEMENT OF OCEANIA PATRICK V. KIRCH University of Califomia at Berkeley n Mr. Bligh 's Bad Language, historian Greg Dening writes that "history is more likely to be born on beaches, marginal spaces in between land and sea." "Beaches," Dening speculates, are landscapes where "every- thing is relativised a little, turned around, where tradition is as much invented as handed down, where otherness is both a new discovery and a reflection of something old" (1992:177). In the mid-second millennium B.C., the coral sand beaches of the Bismarck Archipelago in western Melanesia became just such landscapes of new discovery and past reflec- tion. On beaches with exotic names such as Talepakemalai, Etakosarai, and Apalo, sea-faring strangers who spoke one or more Austronesian languages encountered indigenous people of the land, descendants of the Pleistocene migrants who had first crossed the water barriers into Sahul or Greater Australia more than 35,000 years earlier.' On these tropical beaches between land and sea, a meeting of cultures would transform the face of Melanesia, and within a few short centuries precipitate one of the greatest migratory feats of human history: the conquest of the vast Pacific Ocean and settlement of its myriad islands. The history (or prehistory) of the discovery and settlement of the Pacific Islands by its indigenous inhabitants is one of the oldest and most enduring intellectual issues of Oceanic anthropology, one that continues to drive current research agendas. The methods and approaches to this issue, however, have changed substantially over the years. Earlier in this century, pioneer ethnographers such as Rivers (1914) and Burrows (1939) attempted historical reconstructions based on regional ethnographic comparisons. Because such comparisons were often unsystematic and lacked direct historical controls, they were rejected by many scholars as "conjectural history" without serious academic merit. Linguistic efforts to address the origins and movements of Pacific peoples has a long and somewhat more respectable tradition, which has been greatly strengthened in recent decades, as reviewed by Blust (this volume). Curiously, the one scholarly discipline which takes as its focus the direct, material evidence 57</page><page sequence="2">PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT OF THE PACIFIC of human life- archaeology-was the last to be intensively applied to the problems of Pacific prehistory. Archaeological fieldwork in Micronesia, Polynesia, and Melanesia has been increasing rapidly in its tempo over the past two to three decades, with the result that the chronology and sequence of the human conquest of Oceania are finally being tied to a framework of securely-dated archaeological assemblages. As this archaeological research has progressed from the pioneering excavations of E.W. Gifford in Fiji and New Caledonia some four decades ago to the most recent work in the Bismarck Archipelago, the overarching significance of one major archaeological complex for understanding Oceanic prehistory has become increasingly evident. Marked by a highly distinctive kind of earthenware pottery, this complex bears the name Lapita,2 and is found in beach sites throughout a vast expanse of the southwestern Pacific. The archaeological deposits found in the sand of these beaches provide a record-an historical "text" if you will-of the encounters between Austronesian speaking peoples and the indigenous inhabitants of "Old Melanesia," out of which emerged the roots of Oceanic cultural diversity. It is my aim in this paper to review briefly the significance of the Lapita Cultural Complex for Oceanic culture history, especially with regard to the Austronesian-speaking peoples of this island world. What is Lapita? Three and one-half millennia after these cultural encounters commenced, archaeologists have begun to uncover within the coral sands of Talepakemalai, Etakosarai, and other Melanesian beaches, material remains which are providing significant new data for reconstructing Pacific prehistory. Excavations-primarily in coastal beach terrace sites, but also in a few rock shelters and caves-have produced abundant evidence of the Lapita archaeological horizon. It is essential at this point to summarize a few key details of Lapita as an archaeological entity: its main material characteristics, and its distribution in time and space. Fundamentally, Lapita is defined by a highly distinctive ceramic complex or series (Green 1979a; Kirch and Hunt, eds., 1988; Spriggs, ed. 1990). While the pottery assemblages excavated from Lapita sites vary in details of vessel form and decoration, the similarities between assemblages far outweigh the differences, and the makers of Lapita pottery clearly shared a single cultural tradition. Lapita pottery is earthenware, relatively low-fired without the use of kilns, but incorporating an array of pots, jars, dishes, and bowls, some of the latter supported upon flaring pedestal bases. Much of the pottery, especially the larger storage jars, is 58</page><page sequence="3">LAPITA AND ITS AFTERMATH undecorated plainware, but between 5-15 percent of most assemblages are marked by a complex, sophisticated, and highly stylized decorative system. The designs were impressed into the ceramic surfaces with a series of finely carved, toothed or dentate stamps, probably made of wood or bamboo. The motifs created through the regular combination of a set of individual stamps or design elements follow a rigorous set of artistic conventions or rules, which we can formally reconstruct. These motifs include anthropomorphic faces (Fig-ure 6), and a variety of geometric designs, some of which appear to be stylized transformations of human faces (Spriggs 1990b). Archaeologists have catalogued about 150 distinct motifs-many of which are represented by several allomorphs- and have mapped the distribution of these motifs among Lapita sites.The extremely widespread distribution of Lapita ceramic motifs provides critical evidence that the occupants of these widely-dispersed communities shared a common culture, including artistic conventions. _?i s 0 , 1 5cm Figure 6.

(Drawing by Margaret Davidson) 59</page><page sequence="4">PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT OF THE PACIFIC But Lapita is more than pots. As Roger Green-one of the pioneers of Lapita archaeology-demonstrated nearly 20 years ago, Lapita constitutes a cultural complex of traits, including distinctive settlement patterns, economic subsistence strategies, and non-ceramic material culture. Lapita sites are characteristically situated on beaches, either along the coasts of main islands or frequently on smaller, offshore coral islets (Lepofsky 1988). In these settings at the interface of land and sea, the Lapita people were able to exploit the rich marine resources of the adjacent lagoons and reefs, at the same time that they cleared gardens for tree and root crops inland. Lapita settlements range in size from substantial villages, as represented for example by the extensive Talepakemalai site in the Mussau Islands (Kirch 1988a), down to mid- and small-size hamlets typified by the Nenumbo (RF-2) site in the Reef Islands (Sheppard and Green 1991) and other sites. The architecture of Lapita houses is as yet not well attested, although we know that early settlements in the Bismarck Archipelago included houses elevated on stilts or piles and constructed out over tidal reef flats, while later settlements in the Western Polynesian region seem to have had pole- and-thatch constructions built on beach ridges. The faunal and botanical remains recovered from Lapita occupations reveal that these people had a broad-spectrum economic base. Anaerobically-preserved nuts and seeds from the Talepakemalai and Arawe sites (Kirch 1989; Gosden 1992) reveal that Lapita gardeners were familiar with most of the key Melanesian tree crops, such as the coconut (Cocos nucifera), Canarium almond, Vi-apple (Spondias dul- cis), Tahitian Chestnut (Inocarpus fagiferus) and other species. No direct evidence for root crops such as taro or yam has yet been exca- vated, but these are suggested by the presence of pearl shell peeling knives and scrapers.3 Faunal remains indicate that Lapita people raised domestic pigs, dogs, and chickens, while also hunting wild birds, and heavily exploiting the rich resources of inshore reefs, lagoons, and the deep sea. Lapita sites are densely packed with fish bones and shellfish from a large number of microhabitats. Lapita material culture was rich and complex, including wood- working adzes made of stone and shell, culinary implements such as scrapers and peeling knives, and fishing gear such as shell fishhooks (Green 1992; Kirch 1988a). There is as well a wide range of objects usually classified as "ornaments," although these latter may have functioned primarily as exchange valuables (Kirch 1988b), in a manner closely analogous to the famed "shell money" of several ethnographically-attested Melanesian societies. Indeed, exchange at both local and inter-island levels was a key aspect of Lapita, attested archaeologically by the presence of obsidian, chert, exotic pottery, and 60</page><page sequence="5">LAPITA AND ITS AFTERMATH other material items that can be geochemically "sourced" by archaeologists. Obsidian from the main sources at Talasea (New Britain) and Lou (Admiralty Is.) moved extensively throughout the Bismarck Archipelago, and beyond. The Lapita Dispersal Having characterized some key aspects of Lapita, we may move on to the matter of the distributional limits of Lapita in space and time. Geographically, Lapita sites are distributed from the Bismarck Archi- pelago in the west, through the main Melanesian island arcs (Solomons, Vanuatu, New Caledonia-Loyalties) to Fiji, and beyond to the Poly- nesian islands of Tonga and Samoa in the east (Figure 7). As the frigate bird flies, this is a straight-line distance of more than 4,000 km. To anyone who has studied Pacific anthropology, that a prehistoric culture should span this particular geographic space is remarkable, for Lapita bridges the classic ethnographic divide between Melanesia and Poly- nesia.4 To earlier generations of ethnologists, the conceptual gulf between Melanesia and Polynesia was vast, yet Lapita archaeology tells us that the varied cultures of these two regions must share a common history. The temporal dimension of Lapita has been well delimited by more than 150 radiocarbon dates, on samples excavated from sites throughout this geographic region. These dates indicate that the classic Lapita ceramic tradition persisted for about one millennium, beginning ca. 1500 B.C., and ending about 500 B.C. (Kirch and Hunt 1988a, 1988b; Spriggs 1990).5 The radiocarbon dates also allow us to calibrate approximately the rate of dispersal or movement of Lapita pottery- making groups from west to east. The earliest sites are found in the Bismarck Archipelago at about 3,500 years ago, while the most easterly sites (in Samoa and Tonga) were settled not later than about 3,000 years ago, and perhaps as early as 3,200 years ago. In other words, the dispersal of Lapita over more than 4,000 km was accomplished during a period of between 300 and 500 years. To put this in more directly human terms, if we assume an average of 20 years to a generation, this diaspora took between 15 and 25 human generations to accomplish. A critical aspect of this eastward Lapita dispersal must be stressed. In his paper in this volume, Jim Allen reviews the significant new evidence that early moder humans were successful in colonizing the larger islands of New Britain, New Ireland, and the Solomons chain about 35,000 years ago (see also Allen 1993). But as far as we can determine, these early populations never pushed beyond the eastern 61</page><page sequence="6">t\ h) *0 C,, m rTI rn z H 0-3 0 PO 0Il ni til til 4I Figure 7.

The numbers refer to obsidian sources, as follows: 1, Admiralty Islands; 2, Willaumez, New Britain; 3, D'Entrecasteaux; 4, Banks Islands; 5, Futuna; 6, Tafahi; and 7, Samoa (Fagaloa).</page><page sequence="7">LAPITA AND ITS AFTERMATH terminus of the Solomon Islands, where the first major open ocean barrier (some 450 km wide) confronted them. It remained for the La- pita people, in the second millennium B.C., to cross this water gap and to settle the more remote archipelagos of eastern Melanesia and Western Polynesia. Archaeological evidence clearly demonstrates that the Lapita potters were the first humans to beach their canoes on these lands, for the impact of such human settlement on vulnerable and previously unexploited birds and other endemic fauna is unmistakable. In short, it was the bearers of Lapita culture who precipitated the human conquest of remote Oceania.6 Lapita and Polynesian Origins That the first humans to invade the islands of Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa were makers of Lapita pottery has been definitely established (Kirch 1984; Kirch and Green 1987). These archipelagoes lie at the western "gateway" of the vast Polynesian Triangle (which has its apices at Hawai'i, Easter Island, and New Zealand), and it has been long thought by ethnologists, linguists, and archaeologists to be the immed- iate homeland region in which classic Polynesian culture developed. The historical linguists have shown that the Fijian, Tongan, and Samoan languages all descended from a branch of the Austronesian phylum called Proto-Central Pacific, which probably began to break up as a distinct language community about 3,000 years ago (Geraghty 1983). In this case, the "fit" between archaeology and linguistics seems especi- ally good, and it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the Lapita people who colonized Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa at the close of the second millennium B.C. spoke this Proto-Central Pacific language. Indeed, lexical reconstructions of the Proto-Central Pacific vocabulary are entirely consistent with the archaeological evidence for settlement, agriculture, fishing, and other aspects of the culture. Moreover, extensive archaeological work in Tonga and Samoa has revealed unbroken cultural sequences linking the later Polynesian cultures of these islands with their Lapita forerunners (Kirch and Green 1987). During the course of the first millennium B.C., we can trace changes in the pottery complex, and in other aspects of material cul- ture, that mark the development of distinctive Polynesian traits. The pottery, for example, undergoes a gradual sequence of technological and stylistic changes over a millennium or more (Sand 1992), ending in the ultimate loss of the ceramic art by about A.D. 300.7 What is important to stress in the context of this symposium, however, is that an unbroken sequence or chain can be archaeologically and lin- guistically reconstructed, a sequence that links the modern Polynesian 63</page><page sequence="8">PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT OF THE PACIFIC cultures and languages with the ancestral Lapita Cultural Complex. Let me be clear on one point: I am emphatically not saying that the Lapita people were Polynesians. That would be to reinvoke the silly notion that Lapita dispersal represents a "fast train to Polynesia" out of southeast Asia. It is the other way around: Polynesian culture is one development out of certain Lapita groups who voyaged eastwards into the remote Pacific Islands. Another parallel development occurred in eastern Micronesia, where the earliest archaeologically-documented assemblages on islands such as Chuuk (Truk), Pohnpei, and Kosrae include ceramic assemblages that can be linked with late Lapita. What is especially important for understanding Lapita, however, is that the Polynesian evidence unambiguously links Lapita with speakers of Austronesian languages. Keeping this in mind, let us now return to the beaches of the Bismarck Archipelago, and to some aspects of the immediate origins of Lapita. The Bismarcks, Again: The Immediate Origins of Lapita In order to assess the immediate origins of Lapita in the Bismarck Archipelago, several points must be emphasized: (1) throughout this extensive region, Lapita appears suddenly, at about 3,500 years B.P., as a fully-developed archaeological horizon. No preceding developmental stages have been identified. (2) The earliest Lapita pottery is highly elaborated, with a complex array of vessel forms and a sophisticated design system.8 (3) Although some shell working has now been identified from early Holocene assemblages in the Bismarcks, the array of shell tools, fishhooks, and "ornaments" that occur in early Lapita sites is far more diverse than anything preceding it in the region. (4) The earliest Lapita sites were enmeshed in a highly complex, multi-node, long-distance exchange or trade network, about which I will have more to say shortly. All of these observations suggest that the Lapita "phenomenon" was something quite new and probably intrusive on the western Melanesian landscape, even though it doubtless incorporated older traditions. The strongest indication that the appearance of Lapita in the Bismarcks resulted, in part, from some kind of population movement from adjacent parts of island southeast Asia comes from the pottery. While the particular design system that embellishes Lapita vessels seems to be a local Melanesian expression, the Lapita ceramic complex is 64</page><page sequence="9">LAPITA AND ITS AFTERMATH arguably part of a very widespread ceramic tradition that spread throughout island southeast Asia during the fourth through the second millennia B.C. (Bellwood 1985). This tradition is marked by a large number of attributes-too many to discuss in detail here-but which include aspects of manufacture, vessel forms (including distinctive pedestal-supported bowls), and decorative techniques. Decoration frequently includes both the use of toothed stamps and of red slip. Examples of such southeast Asian ceramic assemblages which closely resemble Lapita include the dentate-stamped Magapit vessels (including pedestal-supported bowls) from northern Luzon in the Philippines (Aoyagi et al. 1985, 1986, 1991), the Kalumpang assemblage from Sulawesi (van Heekeren 1972), and the red-slipped jar assemblage recently excavated by Bellwood and Irwin in Halmahera (Bellwood 1992). Indeed, the multiple similarities between the Halmahera assem- blage and the red-slipped Lapita plainware from the EHB and ECA sites in the Mussau Islands, both of which have nearly identical radiocarbon ages, are quite remarkable. Moreover, these southeast Asian sites also contain arrays of shell tools and ornaments, stone and shell adzes, lithic assemblages, and faunal remains highly similar to those found in the earliest Lapita sites.9 In sum, the archaeological evidence strongly supports the inter- pretation advanced by Bellwood (1985) and others, that Lapita should be viewed as a further extension of the process of later Neolithic expansion that rapidly transformed the island southeast Asian world from about 4-2000 B.C. In my view, this picture is wholly consistent with that of linguistics, in which one subgroup of Austronesian-speaking peoples (Proto-Oceanic) penetrated the north coast of New Guinea and Bismarcks region some 3-4,000 years ago (Ross 1988; Pawley and Ross 1993). Yet, while both the archaeological and linguistic evidence require an interpretation involving the movement of sea-faring, Austronesian- speakers into the Bismarcks in the mid-second millennium B.C., it is also clear that the emergence of the Lapita culture was due to more than this population intrusion alone. As the recent excavations in New Ireland, New Britain, and Buka have shown, western Melanesia had already been settled for more than 30,000 years by the time the Austronesian-speakers appeared on the scene (Allen, this volume). The beaches upon which the Austronesian immigrants landed were not devoid of human tracks. Indeed, western Melanesia was probably already a highly diverse region in terms of the cultures, languages, and genetic makeup of the indigenous inhabitants. Furthermore, it would be wrong to think that the Non-Austro- 65</page><page sequence="10">PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT OF THE PACIFIC nesian speaking indigenous inhabitants of the Bismarcks in the second millennium B.C. were caught in some kind of Paleolithic cultural time- warp. Golson's excavations at the Kuk site in Highland New Guinea (Golson 1990) have demonstrated that initial experimentation with water-control for intensive horticulture (probably of Colocasia taro) had commenced in the early Holocene (ca. 9000 B.P.). Similarly, in the New Guinea lowlands and adjacent islands, we have evidence for tree cropping (of Canarium sp.), and for pig husbandry, by the mid- Holocene. Thus it is likely that the Non-Austronesian speaking populations of the Bismarck Archipelago had already developed a horticultural subsistence base prior to Lapita. These indigenous groups were also involved in some long-distance, inter-island exchange, evidenced by the transfer of small quantities of obsidian, beginning as early as 18,000 years BP (Allen 1993; Summerhayes and Allen 1993). Evidence from several sites in the Bismarck and Solomon Islands in the time period of 5,000-3,500 years BP also indicates new tech- nological developments such as edge- ground stone axes, and shell working for such artifacts as arm rings and fishhooks (Spriggs 1993). Clearly, the emergence of Lapita at about 3,500 years ago in the Bismarcks must have been the result of a complex synergy involving both the indigenous descendants of the Pleistocene colonizers of Sahul, and the immigrant Austronesian-speaking seafarers.10 Understanding this process requires new kinds of models, those that do not paint Lapita in polarized black-or-white opposites of "fast trains to Polynesia," or of wholly indigenous Melanesian origins in splendid isolation (e.g. Allen and White 1989). New Models for Melanesia One such model for the emergence of Lapita in western Melanesia has been proposed by Green (1991b): this is the "Triple-I" model of Intrusion/Innovation/Integration. In Green's words, the Triple-I model requires us to establish archaeologically which elements present in the Lapita cultural complex already existed in Near Oceania,...which elements constitute new additions from sources outside that long settled region, and finally which elements are in fact innovations of Lapita itself (1991:298-299). Let me briefly sketch how such a Triple-I model might help to explain just one aspect of Lapita, namely the highly complex long- 66</page><page sequence="11">LAPITA AND ITS AFTERMATH distance exchange network. The movement of substantial quantities of materials-pottery, obsidian, chert, metavolcanic adzes, oven stones, and other items-between Lapita communities is well documented archaeologically. In the case of the Mussau Lapita sites excavated between 1985-88, we have demonstrated that pottery was being imported from at least 16 different source localities, as well as large quantities of obsidian from both New Britain and the Manus Islands (Kirch 1988a, 1988b; Kirch et al. 1991). Substantial evidence for craft specialization in the manufacture of shell fishhooks and "ornaments" indicates that the Mussau community was exporting large numbers of finished shell objects, probably in part balancing the inward flow of pottery and obsidian. Of course, exchange in other, perishable kinds of materials (foodstuffs, mats, barkcloth) is not evidenced archaeo- logically. The rapid emergence of this highly specialized, multi-node exchange network which linked Lapita communities throughout the Bismarcks, and-within one or two centuries-to communities up to 2,000 km distant in the far eastern Solomon Islands (Sheppard 1993)-can probably only be explained by the kind of Intrusion/Inno- vation/Integration model just discussed. Intrusion is required to explain the highly mobile, sea transport which depended on a new level of voyaging technology, and to account for the sudden appearance of the elaborate ceramic complex. Innovation is suggested by the Lapita design system, a semiotic device not evidenced in ancestral southeast Asian ceramic traditions." And Integration is clearly reflected in the incorporation of the longstanding obsidian trade into a new system, in which the rate of obsidian movement was increased by an order of magnitude. In short, the Lapita culture of 3500-3000 BP in the Bismarck Archipelago was presumably the result of complex social, linguistic, and genetic interactions between the Non-Austronesian-speaking inhabitants of the region, and the immigrant Austronesian speakers. However, there is also the matter of whether certain populations and communities that came into contact with each other on the beaches of Manus, Mussau, New Ireland, and New Britain in the mid-second millennium B.C. were in positions of dominance or hegemony. Some scholars would like to shrive us of the idea that technologically su- perior Austronesians "swept down" on the local Papuans, appropriating nothing more than their obsidian mines (e.g., Allen and White 1989). It is essential to question whether the archaeological records of all the cultural developments that we subsume under the rubric "Lapita" were of Austronesian origin; indeed, we have seen that they were not. But the history of cultural contact teaches us that the 67</page><page sequence="12">PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT OF THE PACIFIC relationship between such cultures-the "structure of the conjuncture" as my colleague Marshall Sahlins (1985) puts it-is seldom, if ever, equal. This is not to say that indigenous and dominated populations blithely absorb in totality the culture of immigrant and dominating groups; a far more complex synthesis, a transformation of structures even as some traits of long duration persist (to invoke Braudel's scheme of history), typically marks such episodes of contact. Yet usually in such situations there is also extensive linguistic borrowing or language replacement of the kind that would explain the modem distributional mosaic of Papuan and Austronesian languages in western Melanesia (Pawley and Ross 1993). I suggest that as seafaring Austronesian speakers ventured into the waters of the Bismarck Sea about 3,500 years ago-perhaps driven, as Goodenough (1982) has speculated, by new opportunities for exploiting interisland trade-the relationships that they established with the indigenous inhabitants of these islands were not equal. I am not necessarily proposing that it was always the Austronesians who were socially, economically, and politically dominant, although the linguistic evidence hints that this may have most frequently been the case. Scholars of Oceanic folklore have long noted a complex set of myths or legends that revolve around a theme of autochthonous, original "land people" (usually with female symbolic associations) who are invaded from the sea by immigrant "sea folk" (usually male in symbolic orientation). Sahlins (1981) has written of the land-sea dualism inherent in the widespread Oceanic concepts of the "stranger king." Could it be that these myths had their ultimate origin in the socially and politically asymmetric relations that were established and played out on the beaches of Melanesia in the second millennium B.C.? Whether or not such myths have any historical basis, they nonetheless provide important indigenous models for the kind of cultural contact and transformation that most archaeologists now believe resulted in the Lapita cultural complex. Conclusion The past decade has truly been an exciting period of discovery in Pacific archaeology, provoking considerable rethinking of our funda- mental concepts of Oceanic prehistory. New data excavated from the Pleistocene caves of New Ireland, and from the beach sands of Mussau and New Britain now challenge the very utility of Melanesia as a culturally-meaningful concept (Green 1991a). The tripartite division 68</page><page sequence="13">LAPITA AND ITS AFTERMATH of Oceania into Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia was proposed by the French explorer Dumont D'Urville in 1831. While Polynesia continues to stand up as a meaningful phylogenetic unit for cultural evolutionary studies (Kirch and Green 1987), it is clear that Melanesia has no coherence as other than a geographic space, a region moreover that incorporates tremendous cultural, linguistic, and biological hetero- geneity (e.g., Friedlaender 1975). The historical basis for this Mel- anesian diversity, a story that extends back in time more than 40,000 years, has finally been revealed by modem archaeology, aided by allied studies in historical linguistics and comparative ethnography. Filling in the details of that story, however, is a task which has only just commenced. NOTES 1. The terms "Sahul" or "Greater Australia" refer to the substantially enlarged continental land mass of New Guinea, Australia, and Tasmania which were joined at various times of lowered sea levels during the Pleistocene (see Allen, this volume). 2. The name Lapita derives from a beach site on the island of New Caledonia, where Prof. E. W. Gifford of the University of California excavated in 1952. 3. Linguistic evidence strongly supports the interpretation of the taro-yam root crop complex being a key component in Lapita agriculture, based on the reconstruction of terms for these plants in the Proto-Oceanic lexicon. French- Wright (1983) has argued on linguistic reconstructions that the Proto-Oceanic speakers had a highly developed horticultural complex based primarily on shifting cultivation. 4.The tripartite division of Oceania into Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia is a nineteenth-century legacy, dating back to the French explorer Dumond d'Urville in 1831. 5. I find no credibility in the recent claim of Spriggs (1990b: 19-20) that Lapita in the Bismarck Archipelago has a time depth as great as 1,800 B.C., based as this is on a single questionable radiocarbon date from the inadequately published Kohin Cave site on Manus. 6. The terms Remote Oceania and Near Oceania were defined by Green (1991). 7. The loss of pottery in Polynesia, which also occurred in several parts of Melanesia, is an intriguing matter for which no single compelling explanation exists. Environmental explanations (such as the absence of suitable clays or temper) are unsatisfactory, and a number of complex social factors (such as changing patterns of long-distance exchange) were probably involved. 8. This pottery complex is, in my opinion, wholly unrelated to the Ramu River and other north coast New Guinea ceramics dating to ca. 5-6000 BP 69</page><page sequence="14">PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT OF THE PACIFIC recently reported by Swadling et al. (1988; Swadling et al. 1991), and mentioned by Allen (this volume). 9. For a more extensive review of the Southeast Asian archaeological assem- blages most closely related to Lapita, see Kirch (1995). 10. I use the term "seafarers" in conjunction with the Austronesian-speaking populations purposefully, because there is strong linguistic evidence (from reconstructions of Proto-Austronesian lexicon) that the early Austronesians had developed the outrigger-canoe and attendant technology. 11. One quite intriguing hypothesis regarding the apparently "sudden" origins of the sophisticated dentate-stamped decorative system that is the hallmark of Lapita pottery, is that this was a direct transfer of a preexisting art style from one medium-tattooing of the body-to another, namely pots. Tattooing appears to be a very old Austronesian phenomenon, and the technique typically involves the use of a "dentate" or toothed comb to puncture the skin and insert the pigment. Green (1979b) some years ago noted the similarities between ethnographically-documented Polynesian tattooing and the Lapita design system, including many common motifs. Moreover, the high frequency of human face motifs on early Lapita ceramics (Spriggs 1990b) suggests that at least some vessel types might have been symbolic representations of people-living or dead-and that the vessels themselves were then being tattooed. While this remains an untested hypothesis, it would readily explain the very rapid appearance of a highly sophisticated design system. 70</page></plain_text>
