Whilst Pond-newts (Triton vulgaris) are found in every pond and even in every pool of rain-water, and larger sheets of water shelter the crested newt (Triton cristatus), the Mountain-newt exercises a more stringent, indeed, a quite specialised choice in the type of its abode. It prefers-at least in the neigh- bourhood of Vienna-larger ponds with clear water, rich in Algse and other water-plants, with smooth light-reflecting bottom, especially a bottom of flint pebbles. It is not to be found in the meadow pools of the deeper valleys, but is abundant in the streams and pools of the hills and mountains of the " Wienerwald." It is perhaps permissible to attribute to this preference for a clear well-illuminated medium, the colour of the Mountain-newt-undoubtedly the most beautiful to be found amongst the members of its family-and the sexual display which is the most accentuated found amongst Newts. The stimulus which provokes this display, as will appear from the observations about to be described, is for the most part an optical one. The sexual life of our native Urodela constitutes a unique phenomenon in the Animal Kingdom, for whilst the fertilisation is internal, nevertheless there is no copulatory act. The spermatozoa are deposited by the male in an elaborately formed packet which is taken up by the female into her cloaca. The causal nexus is repre- sented by the sexual display. The male creeps slowly towards the female or approaches her in short quick jumps, touches her body with his snout, then * Translated from the German by the Communicator.</page><page sequence="2">Analytical Studies on the Mountain-Nezwt. retires a short distance and executes the tail-movement. I shall not take into consideration teleological and especially anthropomorphic and artificial explanations. Whether the male by touching with his snout the female's tail, cloaca and snout, smells her, as Zeller (1890) assumes, or whether he by these methods strives to excite the female and make her receptive, as is usually stated in popular literature, or whether, as appears probable to me, these actions take place accidentally without special purpose during sexual excitement, I will not attempt to decide. The tail-movement consists in the following action. The male bends his tail in hook-like fashion forwards, then he executes vibratory movements with the tail and so brushes his sides (with a pulse of water ?-E.W.M.). A direct contact between the tail and the trunk occurs rarely. Whilst the blows of the tail are being executed, the animal does not shift his place; at most there is a slight backward movement which, however, is not caused by the tail-movement. His body is thrown into a slight quivering movement, and is occasionally erected into an upright position so that the animal even stands on its toes. During the whole process the cloaca is swollen and the sides of the opening slightly divaricated. Only immediately before the deposition of the spermatophore does the cloaca open to its full extent, and is apparently presented in this condition to the female. By this time the peculiar tail-movements have ceased. The male places himself in such a position before the female that he touches her head with his cloaca. If the female, which is attentively watching him, moves away, he follows her without looking round so that the immediate proximity of his cloaca to her head is maintained. His tail is bent to such an extent that it is perpendicular to the axis of the body. A slight quivering movement of the tail has succeeded to the vigorous blows. If, however, the female moves far away the male turns and follows her. The blows of the tail begin anew: after hours and occasionally even days of this display the spermatophore is deposited; the female then creeps over it and takes it up into her cloaca. The present work deals principally with the blows of the tail. It is the object of the research to submit the nature of these movements, their causes, and their relation to the female to experi- mental analysis. The next three sections are devoted exclusively to the description of the experiments; and so I may here relate some of my own observations which may throw light on our problem. The bending of the tail may take place to the right as well as to the left; this, however, does not occur irregularly. Briefly, the male always bends his tail towards the side on which he sees the eyes of thefemale; and, indeed, this 2 D 2 357</page><page sequence="3">W. Finkler. occurs with what might be termed geometrical accuracy. This is better shown by the subjoined diagram than by words. All the positions shown in it I have repeatedly observed, and in every case I could confirm this rule. Further observations will be required to show whether the rule holds with other Urodeles and whether exceptions to it can ever occur in the case of the Mountain- newt. It should be mentioned that Newts occasionally "brush " other objects with their tails. Fatio (1879) and Gasco (1881) observed the deposition of the spermatophore by isolated males, and also by males shut up with other members of their own sex. Wolterstorff relates (1922) that Zeller saw a Triton " brushing" an earthworm. But this was probably a mere tail "wagging " which occasionally occurs in an isolated male, when anything accidentally in the aquarium appears like an object. For the typical tail-strokes only appear without a female on two conditions : first, when a male is isolated for a long time, and in this case the side towards which the stroke is made varies; and secondly, when a great number of specimens are put into a small vessel. Not infrequently I observed that a male T. alpestris " paid court " to another male inside the collecting can in which the day's catch was put whilst being brought to the laboratory. We may remark in passing that there is no difference between the "love- play " as carried out in pools and in the aquarium, i.e., in the wild state as against laboratory conditions. The Mountain-newts are more easily accus- tomed to captivity than other Newts, indeed they make themselves at home in the collecting can. These observations are not only based on experience in the laboratory, they are also derived from animals living in freedom. Thanks to the clearness of the water in which they live, I have been able to,observe Newts mating in pools. The " love-play " occurred exactly as in an improvised aquarium. In this way I could confirm the rule of the relation of the side towards which the tail-stroke is made to the eyes of the females on animals observed in the open. The problems which the sexual life of the Mountain-newt raises are obvious. The question of the necessity of an orgasm in both sexes in order to render fertilisation possible is at once defined.

What are the causes of the various stages, how are they initiated and in what causal relation to each other do they stand ? A complete explanation is, unfortunately, not afforded by the experiments so far carried out. With the exception of the older series noted under Section III, they have all been made outside the limits of the mating period. This circumstance is, however, to some extent advantageous, in that the animals do not begin the tail-stroke spontaneously without the stimulus of experiment, as is uniformly indicated by the controls. The experiments are consequently pure-and in this respect free from objections. II.-The Experimental Production of the Tail Movements in Isolated Males Outside the Limits of the Breeding Season. The experiments were made from the middle of December to the end of January. The aquaria were placed on the window sill of a room, the tem- perature of which was about 15?. Each animal was placed in a separate vessel; plants and special material for the bottom were omitted as they might have had a disturbing influence. The newts had been in the (Biological) Institute since late summer, and had been kept in a big roomy aquarium in which for the most part they collected in groups on bits of bark which floated in the aquarium. They had not assumed their terrestrial " dress " but there was no trace of the formation of the nuptial colours and appearance, that is, of the broad tail with its silvery streaks. I never observed "lbve-play" during the winter in the large aquarium. The tail-stroke was experimentally produced by table-salt. A dose of 2 grammes was added daily to the vessel which held 2 litres, so that each day an additional concentration of 1 gramme per litre was attained. At first, the salt was simply sprinkled in from the hand, later about the fifth day, when the reaction had begun it was added by means of a moistened camel's hair brush. In a few days the sojourn in the salt solution produced the full development of the nuptial dress. The skin colour became slate blue, the fin streaked with yellow and black more distinct, the tail broader and its silver streaks more prominent. The cloaca swelled up and became ridged. The tail-stroke, however, was not produced even when a female was added. To accomplish this it is necessary to cause a rain of salt to fall on a male which is already in the salt solution. The brush loaded with salt is held in the water over the animal and shaken so that the undissolved salt grains fall on the animal's back. At first, headlong flight results from this besprinkling. 359</page><page sequence="5">TW. Finkler. The feet are pressed against the sides and powerful strokes of the tail bring the animal out of its painful position. If the treatment with salt is repeated frequently every day till the daily dose of 2 grammes is used up, the animal becomes accustomed to it, flight becomes less rapid and panic-stricken and finally ceases. In its place another reaction appears, viz., the tail-stroke. The male, as often happens when in the presence of the female, goes several steps backwards, bends the tail like a hook towards one side and wags it till the salt is dissolved. The tail stroke is sometimes replaced by a quivering movement of the tip of the tail. The reaction is most beautifully produced when the region of the head is sprinkled with salt. The direction of the tail- stroke once initiated persists. The distinctness of the reaction, and the time when it begins varies with different individuals. The experiment fails when it is too often repeated in one day, but succeeds again after a considerable interval of rest. After tw'o weeks' sojourn in the solution, the experiment loses in promptness and distinctness even when the daily dose is moderate. Leaving out these factors, the tail-stroke, especially at first, can be obtained promptly and with absolute distinctness. Two control experiments were necessary to determine the active factors more exactly, viz., sprinkling with salt in clean water free from salt, and prolonged culture in salt solution of constant strength. In neither experiment was the tail-stroke ever seen. We may record the observation that if Newts on dry land are sprinkled with salt, they perish in a few minutes, with the appearance of terrible cramp and paralysis. This result cannot be due to the mere interruption of skin respiration, for rubbing the animals with ashes produces no such effects. If, however, the Newts are at once replaced in water, death can be prevented. The sprinkling of the salt in the water is carried out either by rubbing it between the fingers and letting it fall slowly on the head of the animal, or a moistened brush is rubbed in the salt and plunged in the water. If the second method is employed for some time with the same animal, then finally only the immersion of the brush, tvithout adhering salt, is necessary to initiate the tail- stroke. By gently moving the brush to and fro the attention of the animal is aroused and it reacts more quickly. It is true the brush must from time to time be dipped in salt. It is, of course, to be understood that in the experiment with the brush alone, it is carefully cleaned and all remains of salt removed. By leading an electric current through the water, the tail-stroke cannot be initiated, but the bending of the tail and the maximal opening of the cloaca 360</page><page sequence="6">Analytical Studies on the Mmountain-Newt. results. A slight opening of the cloaca was observed to accompany the tail- stroke when this was produced by salt. III.-Artificial Production of the Tail-Stroke in Isolated Females. The arrangements for the experiment were similar to those adopted in the case of males. Females isolated and exposed to normal conditions never produced the tail-stroke, but nevertheless I have seen the production of the tail-stroke characteristic and distinct, occurring in females kept in salt solution. It did not take place as in males as a consequence of the animals being be- sprinkled with salt, but occurred apparently by chance (or rather without reeognisable cause). It most frequently occurred in sunshine when the water was rather warm. It resembled the tail-stroke of the male in every detail. In order to obtain a similar response to that shown by the male to a camel's hair brush, I adopted the following method. Whenever I saw a female executing the stroke, I at once held a brush before her eyes. For the first few times the female interrupts her performance and takes to flight. But the female becomes accustomed to the strange sight much more quickly than the male. This experiment was tried for a week on five females and I was rewarded for my perseverance. The sight of the camel's hair brush started the tail-stroke in two of the females. As with males, it is necessary continually to freshen up the association (or "conditioned reflex "). When, by chance, the tail-stroke is observed, the brush must be at once presented to the animal: then the reaction to the brush continues. The passage of an electric current through the water does not produce, as it does with most males, a bending of the tail, but rather a rolling-up of the tail towards the inner side; the cloaca does not open. IV.--The Reception of the Spermatophore by the Female. Is the reception of the spermatophore by the female causally determined by the previous sexual display (" love-play ") ? To answer this question, I carried out a simple experiment. (In order to avoid misunderstanding and misinterpretation I should like to emphasise that by the word a, not a single experiment but frequently repeated experiments of the same kind are meant.) In early summer when the mating impulse is at its height, and when males and females, if placed together in the same vessel, invariably carry out the "love-play," is the best time for the experiment, which was as follows:- In an aquarium was placed a spermatophore that had just been deposited 361</page><page sequence="7">W. Finkler. In this vessel a female which had become used to the touch of the experimenter was also placed. This female crept about all over the aquarium-incidentally over the spermatophore-but did not take it up. The case was quite different with a female to which a male had just made his " love-play." Such a female placed in the aquarium approached the spermatophore directly and picked it up into her cloaca. The previous "love-play" is, therefore, a necessary condition for the reception of the spermatophore; the tail-stroke is an element in the causal chain leading to fertilisation. V.-Concludizng Remarks. When we attempt to find a theory which will account for the events which have just been described, the most urgent question is to determine how the salt acts in stimulating the animal to begin its tail-stroke. The female might excrete salt which acted as an aphrodisiac on the male and incited him to begin the tail-stroke. Chemical influences acting as an aphrodisiac would not constitute an isolated phenomenon. By means of the (chemical) olfactory sense the male of most mammalian species recognises the female. The secretions of the female are thus capable of acting as an aphro- disiac on the male. In our experiment the stimulus of the NaCl might perhaps have sufficed to induce the tail-stroke in the male. A second possibility is that NaCl, like other injurious factors, tended to bring the sexual impulses to full development. The sudden growth of the sexual impulse after the starvation period of the winter sleep, the frequent absence of sexual development when the sleep is prevented and generous feeding given, certainly constitute evidence for this view. Indeed, Kammerer (1907) states "that sickly animals exhibit a particularly strong sexual impulse, as if they felt it necessary to hasten with the arrangements for the increase of the species." That salt is an extremely injurious factor for Newts is evident from the fact that when it is rubbed into them when they are on dry land they quickly perish. Without excluding these explanations, I am inclined to favour a third alternative, viz., that sodium chloride acts as a sensitiser. The animals become more sensitive and excitable by being kept in a salt solution. A further stimulus, the renewed addition of salt, starts the reaction, which fails to take place in animals kept in tap-water and which, therefore, have not been sensitised. Perhaps we may find here an application of the Weberian law, since the reaction does not take place in higher concentrations of salt solution. 362</page><page sequence="8">Analytical Studies on the Mountain-Newt. The experiment with the camel's hair brush strongly suggests the conclusion that the secondary sexual characters of the partner, considered as sexual stimuli, are ( conditioned reflexes." If the orgasm is always accompanied by the sight of particular parts of the body or the olfactory perception of certain substances, then both impressions are so connected together that-still considering the case we have chosen- the sight of portions of the body can favour and hasten the beginning of the orgasm. How far sexual inversion in mankind (Fetishism, etc.) owes its origin to such a " conditioned reflex," and if by taking into account these results it could be cured, we cannot now discuss. This question may be reserved for a subsequent work on the biological roots of human perversion. The part played by the camel hair brush in the brief laboratory experiment may, in the phylogenetic history of the race, have been assumed by the secon- dary sexual characters of the other sex which have later become specific stimuli. Whether we have to do with a psychical or merely a sensory association is very difficult to decide. In any case the objection made against the theory of sexual selection, that it presupposes an aesthetic sentiment, is no longer valid. That, further, not only bodily characters (Tandler, Frost) but also functional peculiarities are characteristic of species, is proved by the possibility of producing the tail-stroke in the Triton female. The " love-play " of the Newts, therefore, appears to me-I might almost say-puzzling, because in this case the same cause does not, as in most other cases, lead to the expulsion of the sexual cells and to fertilisation. In this case we have neither coitus nor copulation, and yet fertilisation takes place; it is true, not with the inevitability or security provided by these two latter forms of sexual union. The object of the present work is to explain the probable nature of this causal mechanism. Summary of Results. (1) The Mountain-newt (Triton alpestris) has like other Newts internal fertilisation without sexual union. The spermatophore is deposited by the male and afterwards sucked up by the female into her cloaca. This act is preceded by "love-play." The male approaches the female, bends his tail forwards in a hook-like manner and executes quick waving movements with it. The tail is always turned toward the side on which the eyes of the female are situated. (2) If males of the Mountain-newt, whilst kept in a salt solution, are sprinkled with salt, they execute the tail-stroke. Later, it is sufficient to plunge into 363</page><page sequence="9">364 H. R. Hewer. the solution the brush with which previously the salt had been taken up, in order to initiate the tail-stroke. (3) If females are kept in salt solution they also execute the tail-stroke, but this is not initiated by a definite stimulus. However, if the camel's hair brush is frequently held before the eyes of a female when she is executing the stroke, then subsequently she will react to the presentation of the brush by initiating the tail-stroke. (4) Previous " love-play" by the male is a necessary pre-requisite to the taking up of the spermatophore by the female. LITERATURE CITED. Fatio, V., 'Faune des Vertebres de la Suisse,' vol.
