In various directions there are unmistakable signs of discontent with the old order. Such discontent is, no doubt, chronic in philosophy. Still it is more acute at some periods than at others. Anld it appears to be especially acute at the present time. The main causes of this discontent are not far to seek. One result of Kant's Idealism and Comte's Positivism has been an increasing distrust in human knowledge, a growing suspicion of the foundations of science. In a sense, this was the very opposite of what these philosophers really intended. But then results sometimes have this disagreeable way of showing no respect even for the best intentions. The trouble was not with the professed L</page><page sequence="2">1.42 A. WVOLF. philosophers. They shed no idle tears over M fatter, Space, or Time. On the whole they found it rather edifying to coIn- template a purely spiritual world sub specie ceternitatis. Tlle tr ouble arose chiefly with the physicists. Physicists, it is true, have a way of despising metaphysics. But it is onily other people's metaphysics for which they profess contempt. For themselves, they rather indulge their weakiness for meta- physics, and call it by another niame. At all events, in the hanids of physicists the philosophy of Kant and of Comte seems to have developed inlto an exaggerated phenoimienalismii. TIi one respect this exercised a good influenice on physicists: it nmade them iunicomiimonly modlest. Comnpared with the hoa,stfulness of Laplace and the coinfidence of the classical physicists geinerally, latter-day physicists are extraordinarily m1odest. MAniy of them lhave abanldonied the attempt tc- peiletrate the secret of Nature's milechanislmi, they seem rather (loubtful even abouit the validity of far less aniibitious tlheories. The theoretical conistructions of science, we lhave been toldI) are largely factitiouis, they give us no image of reality, they are little more than a mirage. The so-called Laws of Nature ai e only conventional shortlhand summiiaries of past experience, and carry vith themn no warrainty witlh reference to the fuiture. To rely oii them as regards future eveints is simply to draw cheques oni Nature in the uncertain and unfounded hope that they may be honoured.* This veini of modesty, itself the outcome of various philosophic inifluences, has in, its turni called forth a similar tendency in plhilosophy. Pragmatism- or at least one of the rather niumerous and perplexing tendencies for which this niame now stands-is, I take it, all attenmpt to furniish a mnore academiiic philosophic basis for this scientific tendency. " Truth," science laments, " absolute truth is beyond us, our theories are at best biut slhadows, thouglh, * See, for instance, Professor Lamb's Address at the Cambridge Meeting of the Britislh Association (Report 1904).</page><page sequence="3">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 143 strangely enough, they work son)ehow." "Why! " Pragmatism atnswers, " your workinig theories are the very truths you want -tlhe eternal, imnmiiaculate trutlhs wlicli youi lainent, they are mere slhadows that disquiet youi all in vain." I described the scientific attitude jtust referred to as olne of mlodesty. I ami nlot disilnelined to describe Pragmatism siimiilarly. Somiie people will probably disag,ree. Perhaps the way in which the claiims of Pragmatisml are puslhed nmay have somnething to do with thlis. Some people prefer to describe this attituide as onie of Scepticismii. I will niot (lecide betweeni thlese designationis. It is certainly difficuilt to (iraw the lin(e between miiodesty and diflidenice. Unfortunately for this miiodest esti-nate of lhulman know- ledtge, scientific results lhave beeni accumulatinig rapidly, and their practical effects lhave been of tlhe greatest service. Needless to say, the muodest epistemiologists themselves lhave renidered m-iost valuable services in this advance-thou+gh as scientists, nwot as epistemiologists. Now the natuiral na1n11-- even in scielntists arid( philosophers-finds it somiewhat tatntalising to suppose tlhat "laws " so uncertaini in their natui-re slhould nevertlheless prove so reliable. Certailnly, in our practical everyday life, cheques drawn at ranidom aIre not holloured at our pleasure. There muist be somiietlhing definite and substantial corresponding to our chequies. The low estimuate of lhulmian knowledge seemiis, therefore, excessively oldest, not to say unduly sceptical. Our theories would niot wvork if they were Inot truie. They mjay not be the whole truth, 1lbut they mliust be true as iar as they gco. Perlhaps, after all, we do know the 1ealities, aiid niot mnerely their shadows. Henice the present ferment anid discontent. Hinc il(, ltcr?imwa. The niatuiral mani has no misgivings about the validity of his knowledge. Alay not hiis confidence, after all, be better founiided thani the philosopher's diffidenice ? Such ate the heart searchings of philosoplhy at the present day. L 2</page><page sequence="4">144 A. WOLF. ? 2. The Naturalness of Xat tral Realis?n. Sclhiller's gibe at p?hilosophy (in Die Weltweisen) is well known. It nmay be regarded as a compliment to jesting Pilate, who would niot wait for an answer. Phlilosophiy mioves at sulcht a leisurely pace, anid its course is so irregular and uncertaiin, that it would be cruel to leave mnankind to its miiercy for their kniowledge of the world, and the conduct of their lives. Hence, so Schiller tells us, Nature exercised her motherly care anid endowed maen-even unreflective miien-iwith an instinctive knowledge of things, and an instinietive social morality, lest the cosmllic and social order should fall to pieces for want of a comiprehensive phiilosoplhy to keep it together. Now thie cognitive attitude of the so-called plaini miian is commiilonily described as one of naive Realism. Schiller would, no doubt, have preferred to describe it as Natural Realismn, for the reason already suggested. Anid so lonig as it is remenmbered that we are dealinig, not with a philosophic system, but withi a pre-philosophic attitude, that is to say, not with an explicit but only Nvith an implicit philosophy, there can be nio lharm iii calling it Natural Realism, although the lianae is generally reserved for a deliberate philosophic view wlhich seeks to justify the unconiscious assumptions of the nlaive realismli of the unreflective or unsophisticated man. At all events, it is commonly admitted tlhat, though miore or less uniconscious, the cognitive attitude of the unsophisticated imiai, or of Common Sense, is that of Natural Ptealism. Moreover, even as regards professed philosoplhers, whatever their philosophy may be durinlg lhours of secluded nmeditation, no soonier do they pass froma the privacy of their study inito the fresh air of the world outside than they inevitably relapse into the realistic attitude of the plain mani. It is in vaini, says Thomas Reid, that even the greatest sceptic "strains every nerv,e, anid wrestles with nature, and with every object that strikes upon his senses. For, after all, when his strength is spent in thle</page><page sequence="5">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TE)NDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 145 fruitless attempt, lie will be carried downi the torrent witlh the coiymmon herd of believers."* Humne admiiitted as much, and nore. "Nature (he said) will always maiintaiin her rights, and prevail in the end over any abstract reasoning whatsoever."t In fact, Hume went further than that. There were times when " the privilege of a sceptic" weighed rather heavily on him. In one such momiieiit, at least, he miiade a remlarkable and interesting confession, which almost reminds one of Schiller's reference to Nature's motherly care. "Most fortui. nately it happenis (Hume wrote) that since reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, Nature herself suffices to that purpose, and cures me of this philosoplhical melancholy and (lelirium, either by relaxing this l)ent of imiind or by some avocatioil aild lively impression of my senses, which obliterate all these chimeras. I dinie, I play a game of backgammon, I converse with nmy frienlds; and wheil after tliree or four hours' amusemeilt I would returnl to these speculations, they appear so cold, and strained, anld ridiculous, that I cannot find it in my heart to enter into them aniy further."" These lapses inito Natural Reali.sm are to be lmlet with occasionally even in the actual systems of philosophers who are opposed to it in every way. And Sir Williamii Hamilton, as is well known, has compiled more than thirty closely primited pages of references in evidence of " the Universality of the Philosophy of Commnon Sense, or its general recognition in Reality amid in Name, . . fromii the dawn of speculation to the presenit day."? Suclh lapses into Natural Realismi, on the part of plhilo- sophers wlho are otlherwise oppose(l to it, seemii to illustrate the ol(d truth expressed by Horace, in the familiar line- Naturam expellas furca, tameen usque recurret.

Ev-ery philosophy which does lnot assimiiilate anid cover the everyday attitude of its professors stanids self-conldeimined. Its short- com-ning,s have to be suipplemiiented by Nattural R.ealismn as a working, philosophy for the workaday world.

The recenit writingrs of Professoit Alexanider, Professor Berg,son, 1'rofessor Jamties, Professor Hicks, Dr. Moore, Professor Read, AMr. Russell, i)r. Schliller and otlhers, may be cited in proof of this tendency. The present writer is of Opiniioni that the case of Natural lRealism has genierally been abaindonied imuheli too readily, that its posi- tioIi is milore defensible than is comimIionly supposed.

In somiie ways Descartes lhas exercised a bad influence on modern plhilosophy. His (le omniibils dubitandiom-thie imethodl witlh which lhe thought that lhe set otut on1 hiis phiilosophic mission-seem;s to have exercised a fatal fasciniationi over m11aimY moderin thinkers. It looks somiietimnes as though the micaii</page><page sequence="7">NATURAL REALISM AXND PRESENT TENI)ENCIES IN PI1LOSOP'HY. 147 purpose of philosophy were to doubt wherever doubt is at all possible, as thoug(h its main object were, not to explain, but to explaini away. Descartes' own plhilosophy, of course, did not really begin with universal doubt. A philosophy wvhich really begins with universal doubt also ends there. To maike any progress at all you must have something firmi to stand upon. Descartes, it will be remembered, compared himself to Arclhimedes looking for a fixed poinlt in order to raise a world. He thought that he liad found such a fixe(d point in himself- cogito ergo sum. But lhe was mistaken. With such a merely thinking self for starting-point, he mioht perhaps turn a somersault, but lhe could make Ino real advance. In philosophy, as in science and in life, you must begin by accepting the validity of normial perception. That is what Descartes really did after sonme parleyicg, and a show of the most exacting cautiousness. He declined to give recognition to the world of perception, but rather eagerly admiitte(d the existence of Gotl, and then graciously admiiitted the world of perception on t'le streng,th of a divine recommenidation. Such a de omnnibus ditbitandum looks rather farcical. First he strainied at a glnat, then swallowed a camel in order to get at the gnat. Descartes (though, of course, not he alone) also set aih unfortunate example in yet another way, though it is inti- mately connected with the foregoing. His excessive rationalism -his disdain for perception-tended to encourage an exces- sively conceptual and deductive procedure, as though everythimg could be accounted for deductively from gelneral principles. This betrays itself to some extent in the formii, at least, even of his coyito eryo sumn, which, after all, was intended to be the fixed starting-point of his philosophy. It is owingc, to this excessive ratioinalism-or Conceptualisnm, as I should prefer to call it in this connexion-that such undue stress is sometimes laid on Consistency (or the Law of Contradictioni) as the sole test of reality and truth. Descartes, we are told by Cousini, asserted his own existeince even, not on the ground of the</page><page sequence="8">148 A. WOLF. direct testimony of immediate conisciousness, but only because his non-existence would involve a contradiction! Now, great as is the Law of Contradiction, it really is not sufficient to build a solid world uponl, and although perceptual data are, as a miiatter of fact, often smuggled inlto such conceptual systems, yet we need not be surprised that these ideal worlds do seenm rather thin and eery, unlike anything in heaven or on earth. The Law of Contradiction, even if you will give it a positive appear- anice by calling it the Law of Consistency, is after all only a negative principle, and not a positive basis of knowledge. The real root of the tree of knowledge is perception. The Law of Contradiction is but the pruning knife. Perception carries its own justification with it, and must not be doubted simply because doubt is, in a vague way, possible. Doubt everything, aind you may as well doubt whether you are really doubting. Perception is not always true, nor does it give us the whole truth. But from it we start, and by it we are guided; and uliless we rely on the guidance of normal perception, the very grounad of knowledge is removed front under our feet. ? 4. Thbe Epistemological IiLnplicatiom of Natural Realism. "Naive Consciousness (as Lotze remarks*) always takes sensation to be the perception of a complete, externally existing, real thing. It believes that the world lies around us illuminated by its own radiance, and that outside of us tones and odours cross and meet one another in the immeasurable space that plays in the colours belonlging to things. Our senses sometimes close themselves against this continual abundance, and confine us to the course of our inner life; sometimes they open like doors to the arriving stimulus, to receive it as it is in all its grace or ugliness. No doubt disturbs the assurance of this belief, and even the illusions of the senses, insignificant in comiparison with the preponderance of consentient experience, do not shake the * 1icrocosmus, Book III, Chi. IV, ? 1.</page><page sequence="9">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHlLOSOPHY. 149 assurance that we here everywhere look iilto an actual world that does not cease to be as it appears to us, even when otur attention is not turned to it. The brightness of the stars seen by the night wvatcher will, he hopes, continue to shine over him in slumber; tones and perfumes, unhear(d and unsmelt, will be fragrrant and harmnonious afterwards as before; nothing of the sensible world will perish save the accidental perception of it which consciousness formerly possessed." This account of the attitude of common selnse is somnewhat exaggerated. Of course, the plain man would not, and could not, describe his outlook in just such terms. But it is sufficiently accurate for ouir purposes. Now the fundamental assumption underlying this realistic attitude of common sense is that normally the things which we apprehend are really there, alnd that we apprehend them just as they are. The plain man would not describe his cognitive attituide that way, but that is simply because he does not even suispect that all his experiences might be purely subjective, or that it is conceivable for a real thing to be perceived in a mediate or indirect way. And even the more reflective man, who has made acquaintance with rival philo- sophic theories, if he does not simply quote theories, or if he does nlot deliberately re-interpret his experience, will describe his apprehension of things as being of the same realistic and immediate or direct character as in the case of the unsophisti- cated plain man. Professor Alexander has done good service by insisting on the imiportance of beginning with first-hand descriptions of facts and experiences, instead of second-hand technical accounts with their implicit interpretations and inisiliterpretations.* An unsophisticated description of our experience in apprehending thinas would certainly not be in terms of mediate or representative perception, but in terms of direct or immediate perception. Ustually when we say that * See Thke Journal of Education for March and April, 1909.</page><page sequence="10">1O0 A. AWOLF. we touchl tlhe ground, or see the stars, or smell wallflowers, we literally mean wlhat we say. We meani that the ground, stars, and wallflowers are really there, and that we perceive thr)mt themselves, anid niot some sort of representations of them. If all hulmian experiences lhad been normal this assumptioni would never have been quiestioned; in fact, it would probably never come to be explicitly realised, but would have remained ilmplicit. But there are such thingds as illusions anid hallucinia- tioins and other forms of error. And the need of a theory of error has inevitably led to a theory of kinowledge, an examinia- tion of the implicit assumiaiptions of the cognlitive attitude of common sense. The result, as we kniow, has been almost fatal to the plhilosophy of Natural Realism. Idealistic theories of knowledge lhave had it almost all their own way, anid the predominance of idealistic metaphysics seems to be the logical result of the predominiance of idealistic epistemology. The netaphysics of Natuiral Realislmi or Natural Dualisni caii only rest on a realistic epistemologfy, that is, on a theory of know- ledge whichl shall emnbody the essenitials of the imiiplicit assumptions of com-lmoni selise. Wlhat the fundamelntal assunip- tion is wvve have already seen. It is tl)is, that in niomlial perceptioni real things are presenited to IIs, and we apprelhen them just as they are. This is what Sir Williami l ainiiltoii called Real Presentatioinisimi. The questioni, therefore, is, low far canl suiclh a theory of kniowledge be plhilosophically defended ? ? 5. Real&gt; Pres('ntatiwtisnim. Althoughl the ontologry of Natural Realisiim requires the epistemology of R'eal I'resentationism to justify it, this tlheory of kniowledge is also muaintained by others who are not natuiral realists. Professor Alexander, for instance, has been inisisting, recently that niindl is simply a system of processes or reactions directed to variouis objects wl-ichl are presented to it ilm- mediately without tlhe intervention of aiiy tertii2mi qyiffd.</page><page sequence="11">NATURAL REALISM AND PIRESENT TENDENCIES IN PIIILOSOPHY. 151 1)r. Moore has likewise maintained that cognition is essentially ,diaphanous or transparent, and does niot in any way colour or mnodify the things knowii. If 1 uinderstand themii rightly neither Professor Alexander nor Dr. Moore cani be described as natural realists, but their epistemology has nmuch in comlmon with Rleal Presentationism. If I may be allowed to restrict the name Real Presentationism to denote a tlheory of normal perception only, then we might say that the epistemology of P'rofessor Alexander and Dr. Moore includes RLeal Presenta- tionism and a good deal besides. What the additional elements are, and how far they are philosoplhically justifiable, we shall consider atterwards. For the present I am gla(l to note that there is tllis strong tendency towards Real Presentationismii, as is evidenced by the various papers read before tlhe Aristotelian Society by Professor Alexander, Professor Hiclks, Dr. Moore, and others. ? 6. Real P]resentationism and Normnal Perceptionl. As a theory of normal perception Real Presentatioinism is undoubtedly most plausible, because it is so natural. Try to give a bare description of what happens in any instance of normal perception, and you can describe it no otherwise thani as the direct presentation of the perceived thina to the perceiver. Iiitroduce any tertinin qltid into your account of the transaction, and its rIle seenis to be as thanikless as that of any mieddling buisybody. It seems so unnatural to suppose that when seeing, a tree it is not really the tree we appreheiid miientally, but only some kiild of a shadow introjected into us by the tree, or that the tree is not really there at all, or at all events is not really a tree, and what we are dealing withi is either wholly or partly our own creation. This prejudice against the intervention of a tertium qutid in normal perception is not only natural but seems to be fully justified by the scientific rule not to multiply entities unnecessarily. It seems reasonable enough, therefore, to abandon all suclh suipposet</page><page sequence="12">152 A. WOLF. inediating iinagts, shadows, and percepts to the tender mercies of Occamii's razor. For, after all, even if we adiimit such images we still assume that something is apprehended immediately, namely, these supposed imaiges, otherwise we shall be conli- mitted to an infinite regression of such mediatinga shadows- the story of the elephant and the tortoise over again. Why not, therefore, assume at once that it is the things thenmselves which are apprehenided ? And if we are asked for any independenlt evidence ill coII- firmiation of such a thieory of Real Presentationiism, we are not altogether at a loss. For there certainly are cognitive pro- cesses which are devoid of all imagery, except perlhaps the most fragmentary verbal imagery. The experiments of Buehler and others leave no doubt on this point. Siimilar experi- mernts, which I coniducted with a numtiber of very reliable subjects, confirm this general result. The fact itself was, of couirse, known long ago-long before these experiments were even dreamed of. What is called a general idea need not be an image, or involve any imiiagery; it is essentially a schemle of imageless miiental processes. And if it is possible for the higher cognitive processes to take place without imagery, it seems reasonable enough to assume, on the direct evidence of naive consciotustiess, that in perception also we have suchi imagreless mental activity operating immediately on external things. ? 7. Objections against Real Presentationisint. So long as we confilne ourselves to lnormal perception the case for Real Preseintationisim appears to be very strong, as I have tried to show. But already at this stacge certain objectionis may be, and have beenl, urgred against the theory.: (i) Perception is a mode of cognition or knowledge. As such it involves relativity. The object perceived is not known as it is in itself, but only in its relation to the perceiver. So that, after all, supposing even that no imagery, no " sensible species'"</page><page sequence="13">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 15.3 intervene between the perceived object and the perceiving mnind, still the object is only known as perceived, not as it is by itself and apart from this relationship of being apprehended. (ii) In the second place, we know as a matter of fact that perception is mediated by physiological factors (the nlervouis system) and physical factors (air-waves, ether-waves, and odoriferous particles). Must we not therefore suppose that these media really make it impossible for us to apprehenid thlings directly, and as they actually are ? ? 8. The Relativity of Knowledge. The first of the above objections is one of a multitude of things described by the ambiguous expression "relativity of knowledge." But it has the best claim to this title. Now it is true that we are, at present, only concerned with it in so far as it may affect the validity of Real Presentationism as a theory of normal perception. Our remarks, however, are initenlded to apply to it quite generally. The objection simply takes for gyranted the very point at issue. To be known is undoubtedly a kind of relationshil. But then there are relationships and relationships. Even in our everyday life we discriminate between relationships which are comparatively external and miake no appreciable difference to the things or persons related, and relationships which are more intimate and do affect the related ob,jects or persons. My relationship, say, to my parents is no doubt an integral part of myself. But this can scarcely be said of my relationi- ship to my next-door neighbour or to miy hat. My hat is certainly related to me in a different way according as it is on my head, or in my hand, or on the peg outside. But, these actual relationships apart, it can scarcely be maintained that it mnakes any real difference to me or to my hlat whichever of these relations happens to hold good. The question, therefore, whether an object which is related to another is in any way altered by this relationship, depends, not on the mere fact</page><page sequence="14">1,54 A. WOLF. of relationship, but on the character of that relationship. AnI(I to allege that the object 'known becomes altered by the very fact that it stands in tlhis relationislhip of beiing lknowni, is ani unwarranted assumption. As regrards, imiore particularly, normiial perception, the suggrestion seemis to be uinnatural to a degree. Even nlormal pelception, it is true, is fragmentary, inicomplete. But to know a thingc incomiipletely, is a very different thiing fronm having a distorted, or illusory appreheilsion of it. Our experience in norilmal perceptioin carries with it the highest degree of certainty, and miay nlot be called in question iunitil tlhere are positive reasons for suspecting it to be abnormi'al. To qtuestion its validity simiiply oIn the ground of the relation- ship which all knowledge involves is slheer paradox: to ]now ainythinig is to stand to it in the relation of kinowinilg it; btit just because you stalnd in the relationi of knowingl it therefore you cannot know it. The relationslhip betweeni the knower and the klowln certainly appears to be a transparent relationl, wlhieli (toes not affect the object known, nor the person knlowillng, except in so far as his knowledge is thereby inereased. The burden of the proof lies on those wlho would mlainitaiti the contrary. ? 9. ITle Physiology of Normiial Perception and its Validity. The fact that in all perception there is physiological mediation, that perception only follows on the stimulation of sense-organs and the tralnslmiissioln of these stilmiuli to the brai' aloing complex nierve-pathls, lhas been conistalntly usedl as an arg ument to prove that we do not know what things are, but only lhow they afiect us. The physical world as it really is is quiite (lifferent fromii whlat we perceive it to be. NYot that niatuire as it is in itself is niecessarily richler tlaim it appears to us. Tlhe conitrary nmay be nearer to the trutlh.

All the richl profusion of colouir anid comleliness in heaven and on earth is lost in darkness and gr,lootmi for want of a friendly eye. Except for us, or the like of us, all, or nearly all, the woinders and glories of niatule would cease to be, and the external worl(d would resumiie its colourless, soundless, ancd scentless revelry of restless atoms. All the same, it imiay be urged, inifiniitely richer and miore interesting thougrh this world of appearances may he, it is but appearalnce anid not reality. How, then, can it be said that things are known as they are ? The objection has been state(d in its miiore sober forii, in which it is more or less compatible with Hypothetical Realism. It is somiietimiies urge(d in a mnore extravagant formi, in support of the contention that "the wlhole choir of heaveni and fiurnituire )t eartlh" are onily sense-impressions oni ouir brains.

For, froimi this standpoillt it iS too much -of ani atssumllptioIn to speak of "impressions" at all. Onl the otlher lhanid, if youi admit the reality of the brain on the strength of your perception (of other people's brains), wlhy rieject the validity of your otlier perceptions ? Natural conisciousness certainly seemiis to bear witniess that in perception it is the things whiclh we perceive anid Ilot the physiological media. We seenii to klnow the things perceived long, before we learn of the physiological factors ilnvolved in perception. In fact, we onily come to kInow of these physio- logical factors whemi we apprehend tliemii (tlhat is, in others, of (,ourse), in the sanme way that we apprelhenid other material objects. Unless we assumne that ouir norminal apprelhensiomn of immaterial objects is valid, theni we lhave really mmo case, because</page><page sequence="16">156 A. WOLF. we are not entitled to speak of the nervous system. And if we do admit our knowledge of the physiological factors, then we are equally entitled to admit the validity of our appre- hension of all objects of normal perception. In short, the burden of the proof falls on those who would discredit per- ception, and their arguments are not conclusive. The physio- logical factors, after all, may only constitute (as they appear to constitute) the mechanislmi of apprehension, and need not, as such, modify the objects apprehended. We are familiar witlh processes of transmission which leave unaffected the objects transmitted. And if it is urged that the case is not quite analogous, we are quite content to admit that cognition is niot like anythina else, and beg opponients also to bear that in mind.* The fact that even naive consciousness would admit that, say, a coloured surface is not like nerve-processes, and that nerve-processes have no likeness to the perceptions of colour, is no valid objection to our natuiral assumniption that in the end it is the coloured surface that we apprehend, and that we apprehend it just as it is. And we might even invoke the aid of something analogous in mathe-matics; for the fact that x is not equal to y and y is not equal to z does not prove that x is not equal to z. The knowledue, therefore, that normal perceptioni is meldiated in these ways may well supplemeilt, but need not invalidate ordinary perceptual cognition. Lastly, to anticipate the position which I shall endeavour to defend in a suibsequent section, the above objectioni to Natural Realisimi-the objectioni based on the plhysiology of * The uniqueness of the cognitive relationsliip is also apt to be obscured somewhat by extrenme uplholders of Real Preseiitationism. When A is known to B, A is sirmply present to B. Therefore, it is argued, wlheii A is present to D we should, ill consistency, say that I) knows A. But, uniless D is a coinscious being, this is an iniaccurate form of expressionl, because " knowledge" not only implies the "presence'" of A to B (of the known to the knower), but also that unique cognitive attitude of B to A (of the knower to the known), which is oiily possible when B is a consicious being.</page><page sequence="17">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 157 perception-implicitly rests, it appears to me, on an un- warranted assumption, namely, that the body is something quite distinct from the mind, though the mind may somehow uitilise the body as its instrument. This kind of vivisection of the whole man is not suggested by natural consciousness, it is the result of philosophic reflection, and has permeated popular thougtht simply as the result of religious teaching. To natural consciousness man is a concrete unity, and not a dualism, except by way of abstraction. And so long as we do niot adopt a dualistic attitude the nervouis processes in perception form no kind of "external" medium on which objections to the validity of norimial perception might be based. ? 10. Tlte Phlysis of Now imal Perception and its Validity. We turn next to the objection against Real Presentationism, based on the physical mediation of perception. So far we have endeavoured to vindicate Real Presenitationism against objection- based on what may be called the relatively inner nature and mnechanism of perception. We tried to maintain that there is nothing in the character of this inner apparatus to necessitate the assumption that there is anything of the natuire of a veil) any tertium qutid interposed between the.knower aind the known in the case of normial perception. So far as the constitution of the knower is concerned, we endeavoured to show that there is no cause for suspecting the validity of normnal perception, nio reason for supposing that we only see things as " through a glass darkly." But now we are confronted with something which does seeni to be of the nature of an external medium. Our normal perceptions, it is admitted, are nmostly mediated by such physical media as air-waves, ether-waves, anid odoriferous particles. Except in the case of touch, we do not come into immediate contact with the things apprehended; are we then justified in supposing that things are apprehended as they really are, or must we allow that we only know them as modified by these physical media ? M</page><page sequence="18">158 A. WOLF. So far as the scent of thinas is concerned, there is no real mediation. The odoriferous particles emanate from the thing, are parts of the thing itself, and their contact with the sense- organ is, to all intents and purposes, therefore, direct. As regards sound, the most that can be maintained is that sound belongs not to the sounding body by itself, but to it in coiijxtnc- tion with the air-waves. This, however, in nio way underninles the validity of the perception. To perceive a souniding body in conijunction with air-waves is to perceive it in its actual setting. And althotugh it is desirable to discover the separate character of each of the co-operating factors, still evein if we fail in this it is no support for any arg,ument to prove the relativity of knowledge. For, to know things in their actual relationis is to know them as they really are. Simiiilarly with visual perception. The objects seen are seen only through the co-operationi of ether- waves. But in so far as this co-operation or relation is actual, they are seen as they actually are, whether or not we cani discover the separate character of each of the co-operatingy factors. The miiost, then, that need be allowed on the score of the physical mediation of perception is this, that things are niot apprehended as they are in isolation, or independently of one another, but only in their niutual relationis. This miiay sound rather like the familiar view, that we do not know thiings themselves, but only their phenomena or appearances. IIL reality, however, there is no logrical connexioni between these two views. Since tlhings are nmutually interrelated, and not disconnected, to kinow them in their miutual relationis is to kniow them as they really are, and not simply as they appear to be. In short, the knowledge of things in their relations is a very different thing from the relativity of knowledge. The samiie arg,ument might also be used against those wlho attack the validity of normal perception on the ground that we only know things in relation to ourselves. For, evenl so, we still know them in relation to something real, to which they</page><page sequence="19">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHIlLOSOPHY. 159 are actually related, and therefore we know them as they really are. Whilst insisting on the interrelation of things, it may be necessary to guard against the misconception that things con- sist only of relations. This is not at all what I mean. All relations require terms. Things must severally have their own separate characters before they can enter into mutual relations. And it is certainly desirable to discover the separate or independent character of the terms related. Nor is this task altogether an impossible one. It is true that we only apprelhend things in their mutual relations in more or less complex contexts. But this does not prevent us from conceiving their several indepen- dent characters. Consciously or unconsciously we apply the familiar scientific rule of varyino the circurmstances. Properties wlhich are always present under the most diverse conditions are regarded as the essential properties of those things, while those which are solmietimnes present and sometimes absent, according to circumstances, are considered to be the joint products of properties possessed by (or rather constituting) that thing, and certain other conditions, whose presence or absence thus results in the appearance or disappearance of such secondary qualities. This brings us to the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, which we must now consider briefly. ? 11. Prinmary and Secondary Qualities. The difference between priimary and secondary qualities is not always admitted; amid even those who admit the distinction are not agreed as to the ground's of the distinction. But we are not concerned here with the history of the subject; we are only concerned to indicate how the foregoing views affect this problem. It might appear at first that on the view of real presentationism the distinction between primary and secondary qualities is untenable. To some extent this is true. If the distinction is made to correspond with that of objective qualities and subjective sensations, then, just as from the M 2</page><page sequence="20">160 A. WOLF. standpoint of idealist epistemology, there is no room for the distinction, inasmuch as both the so-called primary and secondary qualities are in a sense subjective, that is, dependeint on nmind, so, on the contrary, from the poinit of view of real presentationism, there is no room for this distinction, because they are both of them objective. Nevertheless the two sets of qualities may be usefully distinguished even from the stand- point of realist epistemology, though on different and perhaps truer grounds. Reference has already been mnade, in the preceding section, to the fact that in the case of touch the sense-organ is in immediate contact with its object, so that there is no external physical mediation such as in the case of soulnd, for instanice. We have also pointed out above that, while some properties of things are observed in them amid the most varying circum- stances, others are only apprehended under special conditions. Now, those properties of things which are apprehended imme- diately and unider the most diverse external conditions constitute the primary qualities, while those which are either not apprehended immediately (but only through the media- tion of, say, air-waves - or ether-waves), or are not always apprehended, are secondary. The primiiary qualities are com- plete ;i the separate character of the separate things, and that is why they are apprehended under the most diverse external conditions. The so-called secondary qualities are really complexes produced partly by conditions founid in the separate clharacter of the things in quiestion, and partly by other conditions found in other thiings (say, ether-waves or air-waves), and are colnsequently not always preseint. The imiiportanice conmnmonly attached to the senise of touch is really due, I think, to the fact that in touch, as already explainied, thlere, is n1o external mediation, the contact witlh the object being immediate. Visual perception, on the other hand, is mediated by ether-waves, and that is why we like to confirm or correct visual perception by reference to touch when possible.</page><page sequence="21">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENGIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 161 Secondary qualities as well as primary qualities are, therefore, strictly objective on this view. The fact that they are conditioned by conditions which are not always found together in aniy one thilng, is no argument against their objectivity. No doubt it would in some respects be wiser to indicate the precise permanent or primary qualities of the things concerned instead of attributing to them. the secondary qualities of which they are only partial conditions. That is, of course, what physical science always tries to do-with what success does not concern us at present. On the whole, however, the attitude of naive consciousness is justifiable. The secondary qualities are objective, and even if all the constituent factors or conditions are not usually state(d or recognised explicitly, neither are they explicitly denied. What we have said of secondary qualities is equally true of, and much more obvious in the cases of, such qualities as "fragile," " brittle," " inflammable," and the like, which might almost be included among secondary qualities. Here what is held in view is a certain result, only some of the conditions of which are present in the things so described. The main difference between these and secondary qualities is that there is an explicit consciousness of the requirement of other conI- ditions than those already present in the bodies concerned. It is the presence of some of the requisite conditions and the absence of the others that really constitutes the "permanent possibilities" of such thingrs. Mere possibilities are nothing; these possibilities, however, are realities, only considered with reference to certain results of which they form only a part, and not the totality of conditions. ? 12. Real Presen-tationisnD and Imagination and MHenwoy. Assumiiing for the present that Real Presentationisni has been vindicated as a theory of normal perception, it remains to be seen whether it is also applicable to other modes of normal cognition-imagination and miemory. Several atternpts</page><page sequence="22">162 A. WOLF. have been made to justify such an extension of the theory of Real Presentationism. But, though the case has been made to appear plausible, the arguments do not appear to me to be convincing. It has been urged that in memory and imagina- tion, as in perception, what we have is still merely an apprehension of physical things-though the process of apprehension is, of course, peculiar. An imagined tree or a remnembered tree is as much a physical object as a perceived tree is; only the apprehenision in the former case is of a different kind from that in the latter case. The real point at issuie, lhowever, is not whethier a remembered tree or an imiiaginied one is physical or quasi-physical, but whether in remllemlibering or imaginfinga a tree all that belongs to the nmental side of the relatioinship is a transparent process, such as we supposed in the case of perceptioni. Now I do not for a moment deny that normal mnemory and imagination are mo(les of cogniition whereby we are in touch with the real world. But, all the same, all imagery is essentially relpre- sentative. A remembered tree, even an imagined tree, may be phiysical, no doubt. But an imagined tree or a remembered tree is not the same as an imag,e or a memory-image of a tree. And the image is not physical, but mental. In all imagery (though it may represent something physical and mnay in. that sense be regarded as quasi-physical) we have essentially miediate presentation, not direct presentation- and the medium is miental. In a sense it is, of course, possible to distinguish the image from our having it, and then the image might be regarded as apprelhended in the same direct way as physical things are apprehended (on the theory of Real Presentationism). But the cases are not really sinmilar. The physical things exist in space, whether we klnow them or not; but where, in wlhat linmbo of footless fancies, slhall we suppose these images and memories to spend their fleeting unsubstantial existence in times of neglect, when we do not apprehend themn, and even at the mnoment wlhen we do</page><page sequence="23">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 163 apprehend them ? If they are not a part of the mind, nor a part of physical nature, what then are they ? The conclusion seems, therefore, unavoidable, that all forms of imagination differ very materially from normal perception. In normal perception the mental process is transparent, while the content consists of the presented physical object; in imagi- nation both process and content are mental, though the content is also representative of somethint physical (actual or supposed). ? 13. ilfcAtal Activity. I fail to see any valid objection to the above conclusioni. Why should we not accept the testimony of niatural conscious- ness that the nmind, on its cognitive side, consists partly of transparent activities such as we seern to have in normal per- ception and abstract thotught, and partly of content-activities suchi as we fin(d in imagination an(d memory. Nor can I see any objection to the fuirther assuim-ption that the two kinds of activities constantly co-operate, so that perception and thought contain fragments of imagery. Certainly, if you will insist on reduciing all nmental activity to onie type, then there are only two coulrses openl for you. You either reduice them all to the type of imagination, anid say that even in perception we apprehencd images, and not the things directly; or else you reduce it all to the type of transparent process, and explain or explaini away images as best you can. The first of these alternatives is exposed to the fatal objection that it makes knowledge impossible, siince (on such. a theory) we :ire for ever debarred frorn ascertainiing, how far, if at all, our images represent real thingts. Anid as there is nothing in our normlal perceptual experience to compel us to adopt any such view, it wotuld certainly be folly to adopt such a suicidal epistemology. The second alternative is not open to such fatal objection, but it is, to say the least, very difficult to conceive. It resembles to some extent the attenmpt to reduce all inatter to some mode of inere motioin-imiotion of a soimething</page><page sequence="24">164 A. WOLF. which is neither solid, nor liquid, nor gas. You know wlhat this theory of matter suggested to Professor James Ward. Well, the conception of nmind as a system of transparent activities reminds mie of the same story, and I hope that I shall be forgiveni for adverting to it. It is the story of Alice's adventure in FVonderlan,d, when she saw the gradual disappearance of the Cheshire cat, beginning witli the tip of the tail and ending with the grin, which reinained some time after the rest of the cat had vanislhed. "Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin," thought Alice, " but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life." Professor Alexander, it is true, not only admits, but insists that " self " and " self-knowledge " are very real things, although the self, as he conceives it, merely consists in transparent acts of consciousness, and although consciousness, according to hint, is always coilation, and has no qualitative differences. Such a soul, however, is pure with a vengeaince-almost too pure for this world! And this ;'self-knowledge " is sinmply synonymous with consciousniess-the knowledge or consciousness of self being merely the knowled(fe or consciousness which is the self. Hence he can maintain that consciousness is always self- consciousness. But this only lelps to confirim the suspicion that self-consciousness, in the usual sense of the expression, is beingc degraded to the level of mere consciousiless, rather thani that all consciousniess is being levelled up to self-consciousness. Moreover, though it is with great diffidence that I venture to differ from Professor Alexander, it does not seem to mne that his view, if I understand him rightly, allows sufficient scope for Psyehology. If the content of mental activity is always physical, and the activity is always of the samie quality, the distinction between Physics and Psychology seems to be reduced to this: tllat in Physics the objects are described with a minimum of reference to mental activity (tlhat is to say, only just to allow for the personial equation in observation and measurement), while in Psychology the santie thing,s are</page><page sequence="25">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 165 described over again with explicit reference to the process of apprehension. But if the process is always the same in kind, this seems to be a distinction without a difference. The conception of mind as a system of transparent activities is, I think, also untenable because of its failure to account for the very possibility of dreams and hallucinations. It seenms impossible to realise how a bare, transparent activity can be directed to what is not there, to apprehend what is not given. But this is what actually happens in all such abnornmal experiences. What we have here is something of the nature of production, creation, and, at the very least, distortion. But is not this rather more than can be legitimately credited to the powers of merely transparent processes or activities. or to any system of such activities ? A bare activity mnay, for various reasons, fail to operate even when an object is present; it can scarcely produce an object not given, or even produce a positive modification in a presented object. Again, though the subject does not fall within the scope of this paper, it may be pointed out that feelings and volitions, as distinguished from cognitions, cannot by any means be treated as bare, transparent processes. ? 14. The Whole Man. The difficulty to which reference was made in the preceding section, the difficulty, namely, of conceiving minid as merely a system of processes or activities, though it is considerably increased when these processes are supposed to be transparent, is not altogether peculiar to this specially attenuated view of mind. In some form or other it lurks miore or less in the whole of current psychology. And one cannot help sympathising with Professor Ward's plea for the admission of the Pure Ego into psychology. There is, no doubt, somiiething to be said also on behalf of the almost religious anxiety to keep psychology " scienitific " and free from all metaphysical taint. If one could only be quite sure that this does not result merely</page><page sequence="26">166 A. WOLF. in the clandestine admission of bad metaphysics! For the present, the doctrine of psycho-physical parallelism is the favourite fence for psychologists to sit on. This implicit dualism-another Cartesian legacy !-is, of course, not meta- physics! It is only a temporising, halting metaphysics. It has also sometling of a theological bias. I amn a soul dragging about a body, or ratber ami somehow shadowed by it: together we wander through this vale of tears and the shadow of death; but we are silent companions, and hold no converse; we are ever so near, yet ever so far! To natural consciousness nman, the whole man, appears as a uniity, as a concrete whole, of which mindl alone and body alone are only abstractions. There may be mziilnds without bodies, celtainly-at all evenlts we know nothing to the con- trary. It seems also obvious that there are bodies without minds. But, in any case, what we find in man is a conscious body, or an embodied mind. Science, it is true, is necessarily abstract. And up to a certain point it is possible, it is necessary, and it is legitimlate to treat of the mental aspect only, or of the physiological aspect only. But that is no reason why we should commit ourselves to the " parallelistic" or to any other metaphysical theory. A mere description of the relationiship betweeil body and mind as it appears to natural conisciousness would, I venture to hold, form a more legitimate and more helpful startinig point. And, after all, is not this apparent unity inore or less assumed in various parts of psychology? Does not the psychologist repeatedly fall back pon physiological explanations and suggestions ? There is a well-kniown passage in Goetlhe's Faust where Mephistopheles extols the helpfulness of words in Theology and Metaphysics, because they readily fill gaps in thought. Something sillmilar is true of neuroses in Psychology, and I must beg, forgiveness for parodying Mephistopheles: Yet need we not with too great scruples rack us; .For just where all psychoses lack us, An apt neurosis will serve our turn.</page><page sequence="27">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 167 Now I have no objections to this method. On the contrary, I think it is proper and just. What I would urge is a fuller recognition of its implications. It implies a more intimate relationship than miere parallelism between psychoses and neuroses. It implies something more like what appears to natural consciousness. What we seem to have in a humani beingcr is a verv complex organism exercising mechanical, chemical, vital, and mental activities. These activities are not simply collateral or parallel activities: they are miiost iintimately interrelated, each higher activity in the scale presupposes the lower, witlhout wlhich it does not appear to fuincetion. It was this fact which gave plausibility to thoroug,hgoing mechanical theories. But this extravagant attenipt to explain the higher activities by reference to the lowest has deservedly ceased to couint as a theory to be reckoned with. On the other hand, the extremely opposite attempt to level up the lowest to the hig,hest, and to spiritualise matter appears to be equally extravagant. In the hurnan organism, no doubt, the material processes are subservient to higher ends-the mechanical, chemical, and vital activities, in a sense, prepare the way for the mental activities. Still, systematic interconnection or organic unity is one thing, perfect simplicity or homogeneity is quite another thing. Anid while insisting on the advisability never to lose sight of the unity of the human organism, we must also beware against the specious plausibility of simplify- inr the coinplex whole by making it hoinogeneous with one of its constituents, whether meclhanical or spiritual. Now what- ever the ultimate explanationi of the interconnection miay be, the interconnection itself renmainis a fact. And, as already reiarked, the higher grade activities of man requisition the lower, while the lower appear to take place without the higher. This apparent priority of the lower and its apparently greater iindependence in no way affects the reality or the worth of the hig(her. The human organism, in short, exhibits a</page><page sequence="28">168 A. WOLF hierarchy of reactions to, -or interactions with, its cenvironmnent. The lower ones may all be sum-med up as physiological responses, the hicrhest as mental responses. There imay be, there probably are, higher beings than man and higher activities than his. But this does not render dubious any part of the whole being of man. ?15. Knowledge and E7rior. The reason why we have been insisting on the organic unity of the whole man is twofold. In the first place, it helps to confirm the validity of normal perception. In the second place, it helps us to some extent to surmount the difficulties presented by memory, imagination, dreams, and hallucinations. As to the first of these topics, namely, the validity of normal perception, we may say with Empedocles that " like knows like." Whatever we are that also we can know. It is because we are bodies exercising physical, vital, and mental activities that we can also know beings and modes of being of all grades represented in ourselves. It is absuird even to pretend to regard our own bodies and activities oni the analogy of those outside us, instead of treating other bodies and activities on the analogy of ours (as we actually do normally). We do not merely know- our own bodies and activities, we feel them, we are our bodies and activities. And it is because we are these that we kzow the like of them-like, that is to say, either in part or in whole. This is the root of all anthropo- morphisnm. Indeed, in the wider sense just explained, all human knowledge is essentially anthropomorphic. Of beings and modes of being other than ours we can at best only suppose or believe that they are; we cannot coinceive what they are-except by some kind of anthropomorphism. On these grounds the higher anthropomorphisrn may, I think, be legitimately defended in matters of religion-but this is beyond the scope of the present paper. As regards the second group) of topics referred to at the end</page><page sequence="29">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 169 of the last paragraph but one, some of the difficulties presented by memory, imagination, dreams, and hallucinations have already been alluded to in the two preceding, sections. The subject now requires further coInsideration. In. ? 12 we indicated the difficulty of briniginig the processes of imagination and memory into line with real presenta- tioniism. Thus far, in fact, we endeavoured to defend real presentationism only as a theory of normal perception. We have niot yet dealt eveii with abnormal perceptionss or halluci- nations (including dreams). These present considerable diffi- culties to real presentationism even as a theory of perception. The difficulty, however, is of the same kind as that presented by imagination and memory. For, so far as we are concerned withi these subjects, memory, imagination, dreams, anid halluci- nations hiave theo' same feature in common, and present the same problem to real presentationism, namely, how to account for quasi-perceptions when things are not presented to us. As already suggested in. an earlier part of this paper, the theory of representative perceptioni really had its origin in an attempt to account for error, not for knowledge-for hallucina- tionis and dreams, not for accurate perceptions. The natural explanation was that in these experiences we simply have imriages in our heads without any corresponlding realities outside tlhem. This explanation of commnoni sense is, I thinik, quite rihlit as far as it goes. The trouble arises wheni it is extended also to normal perceptioni so as to interpose imnages between us aind the thlingas perceived. As regards imaginationi, miemory, and abnormal perception it is, I think, no mere faniciful intro- jection to say that there are images in our head. And one reasoin why we insisted on the intimate uiity of mind and body, of psychoses anid neuroses, was to defenid this common view of coninioii sense. What we lhave in all such experienices is lnot a bare transparelnt mnenltal process, but a content-process, that is to say, an activity in which both process and content are mental.</page><page sequence="30">170 A. WOLF. Whereas in normal perception there is a mental process directed to an external content, in all these cases there is an ideal content generated by inner physiological conditions. How this happens is certainly a miiystery; but I can see no valid reasoni for denyingr the fact. At all events this appears to me to be an unsophisticated version of the facts. The retiina normiially plays its impartial rd'le in the apprehension of liaht when stimiulated by an appropriate stimulus; but it also somehow generates such a quasi-apprehension of light when abnormally stimulated by internal conditions. And such, I take it, is the case with other physiological processes. After- sensations, primary miemory-images, dreams, halluciniatioils, and constructive imagination are increasingly comiiplex facts of the same general chlaracter. If it should be objected: is that all, are they sim)ply the results of initernally started nervous processes ? I can only plead that they are not nearly so simnplc as you appear to think. Anid after all, is not tlhis, ill efect, the real assumption of Psychology ? Is not this really implied in the custom, already referred to, of advanlcing neuroses to fill the gaps in psychoses ?-witness the physio- logical "traces" by wlhich nmemiory is explained, and silmilar devices. The specific energy of nlerves, and numerous pathological facts may, I think, be cited in support of my contention. This rnay sound dangerously like inaterialism, but it would be a great mistake to consider it such. Mental processes, ve mainitain, are totally uinlike physiological processes, and they are of a higher order-thiey are the end which the plhysio- logrical processes subserve. And if it is objected that, in that case, physiological processes canniot evolve or generate psychical processes, because this would infringe on the principle of the conservationi of energy anid whiat not, the answer is that " physiological processes," in tlhe abstract, and " psychical processes," inl the abstract, certainily appear to be h-iopelessly divorced; but whatever imiay be the case with suclh bloodless</page><page sequence="31">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 171 abstractions, they are nevertheless intimately united in con- crete reality, and if certain theories will not fit the facts, so much the worse for the theories. Living inan forms a concrete uinity, and we only have ourselves to blame if we break him uip into detached aspects which we cannot puit together again. Such abstraction is necessary and legitimate up to a point, oinly we must not mistake a convenient convention for an inmmutable reality. Now, the above view of "the whole man " einables us to keep fairly close to the views of common sense. We can accept real presentationismii as a theory of normal perception, and we cani account for meniory, imagination, dreams, and halluciniatiotis. On the view of representational perception, knowledge seeims impossible; on the view that the nmind is a system of bare activities or transparent processes of apprehension, error seemiis inmpossible. Onl the above view, both knowledge and error are accounitable, and certainly in normal life no one seriously doubts the existence of either. All humnan knowledge rests ultiimiately on niormiial percep- tion. The sciences formii a comuplex credit systeimi, of wlhiclh normal perceptions constitute the gold reserve. In niormiial perception we apprehend things inmmediately and as they are, thoug,h they inay be more than we directly apprehend. Normtial tactual apprehension is the least exposed to stispicion, because there is no external medium intervening between us and the things apprehended. Where such an externial m-lediumii initer- venes, our apprehension imiay be affected, as lhappenis, for inistance, through the refractioni of light, when, say, a stick is partly immersed in water. In such cases a " miiisapprehension" may be corrected by more direct forms of apprelhension where tlhe miiediation is more or less elimiiinated-as by touchlingc the stick, or obtaining, a nearer view of a distant object. In the case of dreanms and hallucinationis we have quasi-perceptions geilerated abnormally by internal stimulations of the neuroses (or parts of them) actually involved in the corresponding</page><page sequence="32">172 A. WOLF. normal perceptions. In normal memory anid imagination the processes are similar in kilnd, only in their case we realise that tlhere is no external object present at the moment to account for these experiences, at least in their entirety. But we need not pursue the subject any farther, as our schleme requires no changes in the details of the accepted psychological doctrines relating to the mental processes with wlhich we are here concerned. Some brief r-emarks may, however, be added on the general cosmology of nlatural realism, and its relation to ilonistic and pluralistic philosophies. ? 16. i'he Cosmtology of Natural Realismin. On the view of Natural Realism as defended in this paper, the world of reality is what it appears to be to lnormal per- ception. It is also a great deal more than that. How much more it is we certainly do not know; but by the aid of inferences based upon the data furnished by nlormal perception mankind is steadily encroaching upon the vast domiiain of the uniperceived. The limits of human progress towards fuller and completer knowledge need lnot trouble us. The precise delimi- tation of the realms of the Uinknowable is a task wlicih may safely be left to the care of those who are engraged in compiling almanacs for the millenium. It seenms a gratuitous anid uinnecessary slur on the future of our race to measure its hopes by a miodest estimate of our achievemenits. But, be that as it may, the possibility or impossibility of a fuller knowledge nieed niot inivalidate a kniowledge that is less complete, and wliiclh can indeed be supplemented without being supplantedL The reality of other modes of beinig that we know iiot of can onily enrich, anad nlee(d in no wise undermine the world of reality as it is apprehended by natural consciousniess. And the world as thus apprehended colnsists of a vast variety of things existing in space an(l in time, and standing in the most varied relatiolns to one ainother. Some of these realities are conscious beings, and one of these relations is that of kniowledge. Consciouis beings</page><page sequence="33">NATURAL REALISMN AND PRIESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 173 cannot,, of course, exist as conscious beings independently of (their own) consciousness, nor can the relationship of known to knower exist independently of (the knower's) consciousness. But these obvious exceptions apart, there is no reason to suppose that the existence of things and their inutual relatiolis is in any way dependent on consciousness. Thiings are there- fore iindependent of consciausness as regards their existence. They are also independent of consciousness as regards their character, for we have seen no reasoni for relinquishing the assumption of natuiral consciousness that the objects known are in no way modified by being known. Though all things are interrelated, if only because of the continuta of space and time in whiclh they exist, yet their relationis exhibit the most diverse degrees of initimacy-varying as they do from the most inti- iate relationship of absolute dependence to that of extrem-ne repugnance. The fact of interrelatioinship suggests a monistic initerpretation of reality; while the looseness of Imiany of these relations, an(l the imiipossibility of havingr relationslhips without nmore or less independent termis to be related, support a plural- istic view. The view that the world consists or a plurality of nore or less independent thinigs wlich are variouisly inter- related in one continuous space and one continuous time, seems to be all that is warranted oni the basis of natural realism or natural consciousness. That this is no complete or perfectly satisfyinlg explanation of the universe must be granted. This is attested by the almost universal tenidency to seek such a furtlher groutnd of explanation in a Deity variously conceived. The monistic tendency to explain away diversity is inicompatible with niatural realisnm. Eveni the pluralistic view which spiritualises all things and regards all things as psychical in character is at best a gratuitous lhypothesis, and becomes untenable if it in any way attempts to explain away the world of material things. It will never do to explain away the physical world as mnerely symvbolical in some way of an inner spiritual life. After all, even symbols</page><page sequence="34">174 A. WOLF. have a character of their own independently of what they symbolise, represent, or suggest. Lilies are lilies whatever else they inay symbolise. And words are strokes or sounds even though what they represent or suggest may be neither strokes nor soulids. That there are nmaterial things we know. That there are animnate and conscious beinlgs we also know. That nmaterial thliiugs may have other properties besides those knowin to us is quite possible, in fact, highly probable. That there may be conscious beings altogether superior to, and very unlike human beings is also highly probable. To inake mnan the measure of all things may commeind itself to his vanity, but scarcely to his reason. Still, probabilities are matters of Faith. And although it is niecessary to exercise faith, if we are to have ally satisfactory explanation of the world at all, aind although, from the nature of the case, such a faith cannlot be a matter of in(liffeence to us, but mrust profoundly interest, alnd influence us in various ways, yet it is ilnadmissible to subordinate knowledge to faith, to explain away the knowni in the supposed (and erroneously supposed) interests of what is only believed on faith. On the other hand, it may also be noted that, although to profess a belief in God is ofteni only to give a lnamne to aln as yet undiscovered solution of the great riddle of the universe, still that is not the only way of leavino- the riddle, or evading it. ? 17. The Independence of Truth. At the commiiiiencemenit of this paper reference was maade to the diffidence (not to say aanosticism or scepticismii) of science as to the possible attainiment of Truth. It was sugrgested that this diffidence was largely due to the influenice of philosophy, and that, in a sense, therefore, science was only repaying philosophy in its own coin when, in its turn, it helped to give, birth to Pragmatismii. The object of this essay was to vindicate the conifidence of commyion sense against these sceptical or quasi-sceptical tendencies. It may therefore be advisable to</page><page sequence="35">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 175 conclude this paper witlh a brief vindication of the common sense view of Truth as opposed to the pragmatist view. According to the commrion view Truth is something objective, anid independent of our wislhes or hopes, independent even of its own practical consequences. It is assumed as a nmatter of course that truths can be known or discovered. But although our beliefs may be, and often are, true, it is not our believing that makes them true. It is also supposed that truths are eternal-once true always true. I n apparent opposition to this view of Truth, Pragmatism maintains that the true is the "expedient in the long run," that " truth happens to an idea," that "it becomes true, is made true by events."* Such, in brief, is the gist of the opposition. There is no need to enter into all the details of the con- troversy, it will be sufficient to indicate the general lines of our defence of the view of common sense fronm the standpoint of natural realism. In justice to Pragmatism it should be stated at once that the pragmiatist view of truth seems to have been directed primarily against Absolute Idealisin. One extreme, however, does not necessarily warrant another. And, in any case, while assaulting Absolute Idealismii, Pragmatism has also ridden rough-shod over Natural Realisin. In intention, it is true, Pragmatismn pursues its knight-errantry out of chivalrouis regard for the feelings of spoiled humiianity. It seeks to restore to the plain man those pleasant things which a too exacting philosophy has snatched away from him. In effect, however, what Pragmatism has really restored to the plain inan is, nlot the solid fare which he had fondly believed was his, but a mere baby-comforter. Hence the discontent with Praomatist Truth. The position, it is here maintained, is as follows. If we use the word " belief " in the usual psychological sense, that is to say, not as equivalenit to " mere belief," but as denoting all * W. James, Praymatisnm, p. 201.</page><page sequence="36">176 A. WOLF. degrees of assertiveness from " mnere belief " to absolute know- ledge, then we may say that a truth is a true belief (or, when expressed in language, a true proposition). If so, there can be no truth without belief. And since there can be no belief without a believer, there can be no truth without a believer. To this extent, therefore, truth may be said to depend on man, or (to use a famniliar pragmatist adjective) to be "man-tnade." This admnission, however, nmust not be misinterpreted. All that it really involves is that the existence of the belief depends on man, but, granting the existence of the belief, the trnth of the belief does swt depenid on the believer, but is independent of him. This is wllat is nmeant by the " independence " of truth. The truth of a belief depends oni the things to which it refers, aiid the reality and character of the things is independent of their being known, and is not affected by their becomiing known. For exanmple, it depends on me whether I look at the sky or not; it depends on me, therefore, whether or not I think " the sky is clouded." But as soon as I have formed this thought or belief, the truth of it does not depend on me, but on the facts or realities called sky and clouds. Similarly, it depends on me whether or niot I believe that "Mars is inhabited," But once I do believe it, the trtth of the belief does not depend on me in any way, but solely upon the facts referred to, namely, the existence of Mars and its inhabitants (if any), and this does not depend on my belief. The independence of Reality, in short, gives inidepelndence to Truth, notwitlhstandino the dependence of Belief. Even when we realise our beliefs, we do not, strictly speaking, nake our beliefs true, we only prove thenm to be true. Let us consider the most plausible illustra- tion giveni on behalf of Pragmatism. "How miany women's hearts (exclaims Professor James*) are vanquished by the mere sanauine insistence of some man that they must love * lthe Will to Believe, p. 24.</page><page sequence="37">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 177 him! He will not consent to the hypothesis that they cannot. The desire for a certain kind of truth here brings about that special truth's existence, and so it is in innumerable cases of other sorts." It is barbarous to submit the poetry of love to the cold scrutiny of logic; but what must not one do in the cause of Truth! Now what are the bare facts, stated in bare prose ? Romeo loves Juliet. Let us suppose that he believes that Juliet reciprocates his affection, that he there- upon proposes and is accepted. Taking the rosiest view of the case, let us suppose that she accepted him because she loved him. Romeo's belief, then, was true, and it was true simply because as a matter of fact Juliet did love him, and not because he believed that she loved him; she might have loved him just as much (perhaps more so) even if fromn sheer modesty he believed that she did not love him, and he never discovered the fact. The proposal and the consequent acceptance, theni, at most only proved the truth of his belief, it did not macke it true. But perhaps this is not the kind of case contemplated by Professor James. Let us suppose a case where the course of love did not run quite so smooth. Our Romeo believing that Juliet loves him woos her, but is rejected at first. This, of course, would simply prove that his belief was hasty and false. He thereupon modifies his belief. He cannot believe that she does love him (unless he has reason to suspect con- cealment); but he can still believe that she nay come to love him provided certain conditions are fulfilled, which it is in his power to realise. And after sufficient wooing, we'll say, he wins his Juliet. Here again hiis perseverance with its actual happy result only proved the truth of his belief, and did not make it true. Juliet might have been just as capable of loving him if he persisted, he might have believed this to be the case, but fortune mig,ht iiat have favoured him to put his belief to the test, and his belief would have been just as true, though not provein. That the truth of his belief depended on the nature of Juliet, and not simply on his belief, would, of course,</page><page sequence="38">178 A. WOLF. have been showni even more decisively if Juliet flatly refused him till tlle end of the chapter. But Professor James seems to have no sympathy with rejected suitors. What happens in all such cases of beliefs miLcade true is this: X believes, or rather lhopes, that Y,1 may, nnder certain conditions, become Y2, which is just what lhe wants it to be. He thereupon sets about realising the requisite conditions, and theni his hope or belief is realised. This, however, only proves that his belief was true, and does not mla,ke it true; if, in spite of realising the conditions which he had suipposed to be adequate, the desired effect did not follow, that would have _proved that his belief was false, it would not have hw(de it false. But in any case a man's action is, of course, a part of reality, and it is not for a moment deniied that a mani's action may work changes in the world. What is denied is that his mere bclief can affect reality. Belief is indeed necessary to direct human energy to the accomplishing of any task; but it is not the mere belief that realises the task, or which malkes it realisable if, as a matter of fact, it happens to be beyond the power of the believer. In fact, the pragmatist view might almost be inverted. It is not the realisation of our wishes that miiakes our beliefs true, but, on the contrary, it is the truth of our beliefs (as to what can be done, and how) that enables us to realise our wishes. And by the independence of truth what is meant is that the truth of a belief is inidependent of mere belief, just because it depends on the world of reality (including human agents), which L independent of our mere belief. Again, such support as these examples of beliefs followed by changes wrought by the believer seem to lend to the supposed " mutability" of Truth, results entirely from the failure to discriminate between the time in predication and the time of predication. When a belief having reference to a (lefilnite time is expressed at that very time, then there is no need to state this explicitly in the predicate. We therefore say " S is P " when we mean " S is P at such and suchi a time."</page><page sequence="39">NATURAL REALISMI AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PhILOSOPHY. 179 When the time has elapsed it is no longer true to say, " S is P." But this is not because the old truth has become false, only because this proposition has ceased to express that truth adequately. The time i,i predication, having ceased to coincide with the time of predication, must now be stated explicitly in the predicate, thus: "S was P at such ancd suclh a time." And this will always be true, if the assertion " S is P" was true at the time when it was asserted. The pragmatist conception of Truth, as is suagested by the above examples, seems to derive its chief plausibility from a confusioni between the tritth of a belief and the proof of a belief. This confusion, or rather the deliberate identifi- cation of the two, is shown by the pragmatist use of the word " verification." Usually, of course, "verification" nmeans the testing of a belief, the attempt to prove it, but the pragmatist emlploys the expression in the sense of making a belief true. That is why le can speak of truth as an event or a process. The testing or proving of a belief is a process, its trutt is not. Now there are two main kinds of proof, accordinct as the belief to be proved refers to thirlngs whiclh can be adequately appre- liended in perception, or not. At the present moment, for instaince, I believe that the childreni are in the nuirsery. The truth of this belief depends entirely on whether they really arle there or not. If I want to prove my belief I can go there and look. If I see them there then I have proved my belief to be true, but I have not nmade it true. What makes it true, is the children's being there, and my seeing them there does not put them there. In fact, it is only their being, there that enables me to see them there. And so with the inniumrlerable variety of simiilar beliefs. It is ridiculous to say that such beliefs are truie simnply because they " work," or "lead rightly.'" They are truie because, and in so far as, the facts are as they are believed to be. Our apprehension of the facts, though it proves the beliefs to be true, does not make them true. Oii the contrary, it is only in so far as such beliefs atre triue, that</page><page sequence="40">180 A. WOLF. they can be proredl to be true b) suclh apprelhelision. Alnd it is idle to object that our apprehensioni is not conclusive, that it may be illusion or dream. For, as Spinoza has pertinently remarked, a man who is dreamling may well suppose that he is awake, buit a man who is awake can never suppose that he is dreanming. Some of our beliefs, however, cannot be proNved in this simple manner. Take, for examnple, beliefs which are universal (not merely enumerative) in character. Some of these can be proved absolutely oln rational grounds-the propositions of geometry, for instance. Others, such as most of the hypotlheses of science, cannot be proved absolutely, they caln only be confirmedc more and more, in so far as they accounit for, or seenm to represenlt accurately, all the relevant observa- tions inade, and even help us to ariticipate futuire observationis. In such cases we are dealina with an inverse problem, and it is of the nature of an inverse problem, that one cannot as a rule be absolutely sure that any one solution represents the actual way in which the result in question has come about. All one cain say in such cases is that if the operative conditions were suchl as those suggested, then this result would necessarily follow; but it is just possible that some other conditionis inigrlht have produced this result. Strictly speaking, therefore, many of the so-called "verified" hypotheses are beliefs that "(works" or "lead riglhtly," rather than fully established truths.* But eveii these are either true or false. And their truth or falsity depends lnot on our beliefs, nor on their " right leading," buit on the independenitly existing facts to which they refer. Onily we cannot prove thleir truth by such siniple inspection as sufficed * The pragmatist, it is trtue, deniies tlhe existence of uinverifia ble truths-but scarcely with a good conscience. Why is it insisted on thiat it is not always enough for a belief to be expedient for a while, in order to be true, but that it must be expedient "1 in the lonkg run " ? Is it iiot because the pragmatist realises that some beliefs are only verifiable at the millennium or tlhereabouts ? If so, of coturse, there is no need to quarrel as to wlhetlher thtese should be described as "unverified" or as "tln- verifiable."</page><page sequence="41">NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHIOSOPHY. 181 in the above illustration. If they are true, it is not because they "work," but rather they "work " only in so far as they are true, either altogether or in part. Again, what has just been renmarked of scientific hypotheses applies also to beliefs which are not capable (or are not supposed to be capable) of verification in the scientific sense. Religious beliefs, as already suggested, cannot be, and as a rule are not, called Truths in the scienltific sense. They are popularly called Beliefs or Articles of Faith, because, althouah they are believed to be true, they are not regarded as pr-oved true-and that is just why it is considered to be a merit to believe them. Now, all that can be done in such cases is to observe what effects these beliefs appear to have on their professors. But ouir attitude changes to that extent frorn the intellectuial to the moral standpoint. Beliefs which appear to exercise a good influence on coinduct may be judged to be good. And lhowever much various beliefs or faiths may differ from one another, so long as they appear to exercise an equally good influence over their votaries they may be considered equally good. But the goodness of a belief is no proof of its truth, much less is it identical with it, and conflict- ing, beliefs, thoughl they may be equally good, cannot be equally true. Each belief is either true or false, and this depends neither on our choice nor on its effects, but on the reality to wlich it refers, and which is independent of our mere beliefs. If it should be objected that, after all, Pragmatism is only insistin(t oni what has actually been urged in this very paper, nanaely, that we should considers" the whole man," and not merely aspects of him divorced from one another, our answer is, so far so good, but you do not get the whole by confusing the parts. The motive underlying the pragmatist view of Truth is certainly praiseworthy. If people could be brought to believe that their religious views, however diverse, may yet be equally true provided they make them equally good, it would certainly make for tolerance. And tolerance is a fine thing. But the method is a mistaken one. People of a syinpathetic</page><page sequence="42">182 NATURAL REALISM AND PRESENT TENDENCIES IN PHILOSOPHY. character will realise the primiiacy of their moral duties, and will agree to differ on matters of belief, recognising that coercion and bribery are not logical arguments, and that it is folly to commit a sure wrong in the supposed iilterests of a possible truth, however strongly they may believe it. The zealots, on the other hand, who set theinselves up as the only and supreme models of humanity, will scarcely be persuaded by the logic of Pragmatism. And on most people the effect can scarcely be salutary. The suggestion that different beliefs may be equally true rather conveys the idea that they are really equally doubtful, and that at best we only make-believe. On the whole, suiely it is a more inspiring conception, even from a pragmatist standpoint, that Truth is neither inutable nor man-made, and that though we mnay all approach it alongu different roads, anid fall into various pitfalls on the way, yet we are all seeking the same fuller and completer knowledge of the same real world, which we can also inake better as we get to know it better. But, be that as it, may, Reality is in the main independent of us, and the truth of our beliefs depending,i as it does, on Reality, is to that extent independeint of us.</page></plain_text>
