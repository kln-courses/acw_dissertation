<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EXEGETICAL BACKGROUND OF THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON by KARINAKARINA MARTIN HOGAN* The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL One of the most often-discussed issues in scholarship on the Wisdom of Solomon is the author's understanding of death and its relationship to human sinfulness.1 This problem has been addressed most recendy and, in my view, most successfully, by Michael Kolarcik, SJ.2 Kolarcik demonstrates through a literary analysis of the structure and judicial imagery of Wis 1:1-6:21 that the author's central purpose in these chap ters is to refute a false notion of death, placed on the lips of "the un godly" (ασεβείς; 1:9 etc.).3 Pseudo-Solomon uses the underlying image of a trial to pit the nihilistic attitude of "the ungodly" toward mortality against the hope of "the righteous" for immortality; the reader is called upon to judge between the two.4 Kolarcik's conclusion is that Pseudo * I would like to thank Dr. John J. Collins for his invaluable suggestions and encour agement in the preparation of this essay. 1 Besides the commentaries' more or less extensive treatment of this topic, there have been a number of articles on the subject.

Ironically, they are both right from Pseudo-Solomon's point of view, since he believes that the immortality of the soul is contingent upon the way one chooses to live one's life. The ungodly forfeit immor talitytality through their sinful lives, so for them, physical death does amount to annihilation. Hence physical death can be presented as a punishment for wickedness, but for the righteous it represents a limit to suffering and a path to union with God.6 By examining the statements about death in Wis 1-6 in the context of the complex argument in which they occur, Kolarcik has shown that Pseudo-Solomon's perspective on death is more coherent than many scholars have supposed. Earlier scholars tended to isolate the most striking statements about death in Wisdom (especially 1:13 and 2:23-4) and to interpret them in light of Gen 1-3, to which these and several other verses in Wisdom allude. The problem with this approach, Kolarcik points out, is the temptation to read one's preconceptions about the "Creation and Fall" into the ambiguous statements about death in Wisdom.7 Kolarcik does not completely avoid this pitfall him self, however. He offers his own interpretation of Gen 1-3 (informed by contemporary biblical scholarship) in order to establish that "the interpretation [of Gen 1-3] whereby human mortality is taken as the consequence of Adam's disobedience is not self evident [ji'c] in Wis."8 Kolarcik's brief exegesis of Gen 1-3 contributes little to his argument for the ambiguity of death in Wisdom. Rather than arguing on the basis of what Gen 1-3 "actually says" about the origin of death, it would have been more fruitful to explore the exegetical background of Pseudo-Solomon's allusions to Gen 1-3. Kolarcik does suggest that Pseudo-Solomon's understanding of Gen צ Taylor ("Eschatological Meaning," 102-16) attempts to distinguish the exact nuances of each of these terms and to determine which refer to physical death and which to spiritual death. In most cases, he is forced to conclude that the author's usage of a given term is inconsistent or ambiguous. 6 Kolarcik, Ambiguity, 178-80. 7 Ibid., 139. 8 Ibid., 146.</page><page sequence="3">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 3 1 -3 might profitably be compared to that of Philo of Alexandria.9 Since the two authors are believed to have been near-contemporaries in the Alexandrian Jewish community, they can be expected to have been familiar with some of the same exegetical traditions.10 This paper will pursue the comparison proposed by Kolarcik, extending it to include Gen 4. For both Philo and Pseudo-Solomon, the story of Cain and Abel, as much as that of Adam and Eve, appears to have been emblem atic of the relationship between sin and death. After summarizing the main themes of the extensive exegesis of Gen 1-4 in Philo, we will be in a position to examine the allusions in Wisdom to key passages in Gen 1-4, with an eye to the exegetical traditions that they reflect. The object of this comparison is not to argue for a direct relationship be tween Wisdom and Philo, but rather to offer a preliminary sketch of the exegetical background against which Pseudo-Solomon's enigmatic statements about death may better be understood. For the purposes of this study, therefore, I will be concerned not so much with Philo's original contributions to the exegesis of Gen 1-4 as with the older exegetical traditions preserved in his works. Recent schol arship on Philo has drawn attention to the extent to which Philo's trea tises incorporate older sources and traditions, especially the exegetical traditions of earlier generations of Alexandrian Jews." In particular, the work of Thomas H. Tobin, SJ on the interpretation of the creation of man in Philo is the model and the starting point for this paper.12 According to Tobin, Philo preserves several earlier stages of interpre tation of the two accounts of the creation of man (Gen 1:26-7 and 2:7) alongf with his own allegorical internretations. Tohin uses several criteria 9 Ibid. 10 James Kugel (The Bible as it Was [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997]) repeatedly illustrates that the Wisdom of Solomon alludes to exegetical motifs that are attested not only in Philo, but also in roughly-contemporary and earlier Palestinian sources. " This trend was set in the early 1970's by two programmatic essays: Robert G. Hammerton-Kelly, "Sources and Traditions in Philo Judaeus: Prolegomena to an Ana lysis of his Writings," Studia Philonica 1 (1972) 3-26 and Burton L. Mack, "Exegetical Traditions in Alexandrian Judaism: A Program for the Analysis of the Philonic Corpus," Studia Studia Studia Phihnica 3 (1974-5) 71-112. 12 Thomas H. Tobin, S.J., The Creation of Man: Philo and the History of Interpretation (CBQMS 14; Washington, D.C.: The Catholic Biblical Association of America, 1983). I will use Tobin's phrase "the creation of man" for the sake of brevity and because most inteipretations in Philo assume that both Gen 1:26-7 and Gen 2:7 describe the creation of a single male human being (despite the explicit statement to the contrary in Gen 1:27).</page><page sequence="4">KARINA MARTIN HOGAN to establish the relative chronology of these stages of interpretation: indications by Philo that he is citing an interpretation which is not his own, logical dependence of one stage of interpretation upon another, and comparison with the contemporaneous developments of Alexandrian philosophy and the allegorical interpretation of Homer. More recently, Gregory Sterling has demonstrated that in 1 Cor 2:6-3:4 and 15:42 49, Paul is arguing against interpretations of the creation of man that are otherwise known only from Philo.13 Since it is unlikely that Philo's works could have reached Corinth prior to PauFs first visit there (some time before 53 ce), these interpretations were probably well known among Hellenized Jews of the early first century ce.14 Traditions Traditions about the Creation of Man in Philo The earliest stage of exegesis preserved in Philo, which all the other interpretations of the creation accounts take for granted, Tobin calls the "anti-anthropomorphic" interpretations.15 Each of these is motivated by an apparent anthropomorphism applied to God in the biblical text, which is then explained away by reference to philosophical concepts. The anti-anthropomorphic interpretations of the creation of man seem to derive from two different philosophic schools. Platonic concepts are typically used to explain Gen 1:26-7, as for example in Op. 69:16 ... Moses tells us that man was created after the image of God and after his likeness (κατ' εικόνα θεοΰ και καθ' όμοίωσιν). Right well does he say this, for nothing earth-born is more like God than man. Let no one rep resent the likeness as one to a bodily form; for neither is God in human form, nor is the human body God-like. No, it is in respect of the mind, 13 Gregory Ε. Sterling, "Wisdom among the Perfect: Creation Traditions in Alexandrian Judaism and Corinthian Christianity," NovT 37 (1995) 364-76. 14 Ibid., 382-4. 15 This type of exegesis was first identified by Mack, "Exegetical Traditions," 81. Anti-anthropomorphic exegesis can be traced back as far as Aristobulus, an Alexandrian Jew of the mid-second century bce. See Adela Yarbro Collins' translation of Aristobulus, fragment 2, in James H. Charlesworth, ed. Old Testament Pseudepigrapha (2 vols; New York: Doubleday, 1985) 2. 837-9. According to Tobin (Creation, 37-40), examples of this type of interpretation in Philo can be found in Op. 69-71, Q.G. 1.21, LA. 1.36-8, and Op.Op. 72-5 (with parallels in Conf. 168-82, Mut. 27-32 and Fug. 68-72). 16 All translations of Philo from the Greek are by F.H. Colson and G.H. Whitaker (LCL, 10 Volumes; London: William Heinemann Ltd., 1929). Quaestiones et Solutiones in GenemGenem et Exodum (Q.G. and Q^E.), of which only fragments survive in Greek, were trans lated from the Armenian version by Ralph Marcus (LCL, 2 Supplement Volumes; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1953).</page><page sequence="5">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 5 the sovereign (ηγεμόνα) element of the soul, that the word "image" is used; for after the pattern of a single Mind, even the Mind of the uni verse as an archetype, the mind in each of those who successively came into being was moulded (άπεικονίσθη).17 Interpretations Interpretations of Gen 2:7, on the other hand, tend to resort to Stoic concepts, as in LA. 1.36-8: "Breathed into," we note, is equivalent to "inspired" or "be-souled" (έψύχωσε)(έψύχωσε) the soul-less (άψυχα); for God forbid that we should be infected with such monstrous folly as to think that God employs for inbreathing organs such as mouth or nostrils.. . . Yet the expression clearly brings out something that accords with nature (φυσικώτερον). For it implies of necessity three things; that which inbreathes, that which receives, that which is inbreathed: that which inbreathes is God, that which receives is the mind, and that which is inbreathed is the spirit (τό πνεΰμα).... A union of the three comes about, as God pro jects the power that proceeds from Himself through the mediant breath (πνεΰμα) till it reaches the subject. And for what purpose save that we may obtain a conception of him? For how could the soul have conceived of God, had He not breathed into it and mightily laid hold of it?18 A similar division between Platonic and Stoic interpretations exists at the next stage of the exegesis of Gen 1:26-7 and 2:7, which Tobin refers to as the first "single creation" stage. Unlike the earlier anti anthropomorphic interpretations, which dealt with isolated "problems" in the biblical narrative, this next stage of interpretation attempted to provide coherent philosophical explanations of the Genesis accounts of the creation of man.19 The first account of the creation of man is ex pounded at this stage with the concepts of Middle Platonism, especially the notion of the Logos as the intermediary between God and the creation:20 7י The main Platonic text behind this and other interpretations of the creation accounts is, of course, the Timaeus. According to Tobin (Creation, 46), this passage reflects a stage of Platonism prior to Middle Platonism, because of the absence of an intermediary between the Creator and the world. The intermediary figure first appears in texts of the late first century bce, such as the Timaeus Locrus. 10 This interpretation is obviously not consistently Stoic, since it envisions a tran scendent God. Yet the identification of the πνοή ζωής of Gen 2:7 (LXX) with the πνεΰμα, a key concept of Stoicism, shows that the main philosophical background of the passage is Stoic.

It is Moses who lays this down, not I.I. Witness his express acknowledgement in the sequel, when setting on record the creation of man, that he was moulded (διετυπώθη) after the image of God (κατ' εικόνα θεοϋ). Now if the part is the image of an image, it is manifest that the whole world is so too, and if the whole creation . . . is a copy (μίμημα) of the divine image, it is manifest that the archetypal seal (ή αρχέτυπος σφραγίς) also, which we aver to be the world descried by the mind, would be the very Word of God.21 The expression κατ' εικόνα θεοΰ in Gen 1:27 is taken to mean that the human person is "the image of an image," a copy (μίμημα) of the original divine image or "archetypal seal" that is the Logos. Philo preserves only traces of a Stoic interpretation of the second creation account from this stage, but it seems to have been chiefly con cerned with identifying the human soul as a "divine fragment" (άπόσπα σμασμα θείον) of the aethereal πνεύμα (LA. 3.161) or as an "effulgence" (απαύγασμα) of the divine nature (Spec. 4.123).22 This can be inferred in part from the second phase of the "single creation" interpretation, in which the two accounts of the creation of man were combined, lead ing to a blending of Stoic and Platonic concepts. This tendency can be seen most clearly in Det. 83, in which the "Stoic" πνεΰμα (associated with Gen 2:7) is equated with the "Platonic" είκών (of Gen 1:26-7): To the faculty which we have in common with the irrational creatures blood has been given as its essence, but of the faculty which streams forth from the fountain of Reason spirit (πνεΰμα) has been assigned; not moving air but, as it were, an impression and stamp (τύπον τινά και χαρακτήρα) of the divine power, to which Moses gives the appropri ate title of "image" (είκών), thus indicating that God is the Archetype of rational existence, while man is a copy (μίμημα) and a representation (άπεικόνισμα).23 The next stage of interpretation, called the "double creation," treats the two creation accounts as referring to two different men, the first 21 Op. 24-5; cf.

By this also he shows very clearly that there is a vast difference between the man thus formed (ό πλασθείς άνθρωπος) and the man that came into existence ear lier after the image of God (ό κατά την εικόνα γεγονώς πρότερον); for the man so formed is an object of sense-perception (αισθητός), partaking already of such or such quality, consisting of body and soul (έκ σώματος καΐ ψυχής), man or woman, by nature mortal; while he that was after the [Divine] image was an idea (ιδέα) or type (γένος) or seal (σφραγίς), an object of thought (νοητός) [only], incorporeal (ασώματος), neither male nor female, by nature incorruptible (άφθαρτος).25 The idea of a double creation of man is commonly associated with Philo, but Tobin argues that it must have been part of the exegetical tradition that Philo inherited, since Philo frequently "corrects" it to refer not to two men but to two minds.26 Usually, this correction is implicit, as as in the following "refinement" of the "Stoic" reading of Gen 2:7: [Moses] uses the word "breath" (πνοή) and not "spirit" (πνεΰμα), imply ing a difference between thern; for "spirit" is conceived of as connoting strength and vigor and power, while a "breath" is like an air or a peace ful and gentle vapor. The mind that was made after the image and orig inal might be said to partake of spirit, for its reasoning faculty possesses robustness; but the mind that was made out of matter must be said to partake of the light and less substantial air... .27 The shift from two men to two minds is motivated by Philo's orig inal way of reading Gen 1-3 as referring not to events which the first couple experienced, but to universal psychological phenomena.28 Tobin 24 These are the terms used to distinguish the two men in L.A. 1.31-2 and 1.90. Cf. 1 Cor 15:47-9. Elsewhere (as in the following passage) they are referred to as the "man after the image" and the "molded man;" see QG. 1.4, 1.8, and 2.56. In Conf. 41, 62-3 and 146, the "heavenly man" is identified explicidy with the Logos. 25 Colson and Whitaker (Philo, LCL) obscure Philo's terminology by translating πλασθείς as "formed," while they render διετυπώθη (Op. 25) and άπεικονίσθη (Op. 69) as "moulded." 26 Tobin, Creation, 135-9. The fact that the double creation of man is not Philo's own idea becomes clear in Q.G. 1.8, where it is implied in the position with which Philo disagrees. 27 L.A. 1.42. 28 Although in Quaestiones et Solutionis in Genesin Philo frequently expresses a prefer ence for the allegorical reading of Gen 2-3, he does not deny the validity of the more</page><page sequence="8">KARINAKARINA MARTIN HOGAN 8 calls Philo's original reading of Gen 1-3 "the allegory of the soul," and points out that it is more concerned with subsequent "events" in the Garden of Eden than with the creation itself.29 Although Philo inter preted some verses that relate to the man alone allegorically (Gen 2:8, 15 and 16-7), the allegory of the soul focuses on the creation of woman and the events of Gen 3. Traditions Traditions about Adam and Eve in Philo Most of Philo's statements about the disobedience of Adam and Eve and its consequences are on the level of the allegory of the soul, and therefore are not direcdy relevant to our investigation. Nevertheless, it is necessary to explain briefly Philo's allegorical interpretation of Gen 3, in order to be able to show that certain other interpretations of Gen 3 are probably pre-Philonic. According to the allegory of the soul, the man represents the mind; the woman, sense-perception and the serpent, pleasure.30 In the most radically allegorical passages, Philo presents the "Fall" as merely the necessary union of intellect and sense perception, which is certainly not sinful in itself: Two things, mind and bodily sense (αϊσθησις), having already come into being... it was necessary that there should be a third subsistence, namely pleasure, to bring both of them together to the apprehension of the objects of mental and of bodily perception. For neither could the mind apart from the bodily sense apprehend. . . any bodily shape whatever, nor could the bodily sense apart from the mind maintain the act of perceiving. Since then it was necessary that both of these should come together for the apprehension of the objects about them, who was it that brought them together save a third, a bond of love and desire, under the rule and dominion of pleasure, to which the prophet gave the figurative name of a serpent?31 literal interpretations that he transmits. Tobin, Creation, 154-61, argues that Philo's unique contribution to the history of exegesis was the idea that a text could have more than one level of meaning; that is, that a literal and an allegorical interpretation of a given text could both be valid. 29 Tobin, Creation, 135-49. The distinction between the earthly and heavenly mind is made on the basis of Gen 2:8, 15 and 16-7. See especially L.A. 1.53-5, 88-9, 90-91 and Q.G. 1.8. 30 Op: 165. 31 L.A. 2.71-2; cf. L.A. 3.57-8, Cher. 56-60. It seems that in the background of this allegory lurks a literal interpretation that maintains that Adam and Eve did not have sexual relations until after they ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</page><page sequence="9">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 9 More often, however, he uses the story to moralize about the bad consequences of allowing the mind to be ruled by the senses, which are susceptible to the lure of pleasure.32 The allegory of the soul is only loosely based on Gen 3; not every verse can be fitted into the allegorical framework. Only in one place does Philo claim textual justification for his allegorical reading, and the effect is to expose the lack of connection between the allegory and the narrative itself. In explaining why God is said to make "tunics of skin" for Adam and Eve just before their expulsion from the garden (Gen 3:21), he writes: . .. But according to the deeper meaning, the tunic of skin is symboli cally the natural skin of the body. For when God formed the first mind, He called it Adam; then he formed the sense, which he called Life [i.e., Eve]; in the third place, of necessity he made his body also, calling it symbolically a tunic of skin, for it was proper that the mind and sense should be clothed in the body as in a tunic of skin, in order that His handiwork might first appear worthy of the divine power. And could the apparel of the human body be better or more fittingly made by any other power than God?33 The implication of this interpretation is that the events in the Garden of Eden are not part of human history, since Adam and Eve cannot properly be called human until they are given bodies. According to Philo, Gen 2 and 3 are best read as timeless, symbolic descriptions of human psychology. Following Tobin's methodology, we can identify a few interpreta tions of Gen 3 that are incompatible with the allegory of the soul, and therefore are probably pre-Philonic traditions. These are mostly pre served in Quaestiones et Solutiones in Genesin, a collection of isolated inter pretations of verses, many of which Philo acknowledges are not his own. For example, the following interpretation of Gen 3:19 shows no awareness of the division of the soul into mind and sense perception which underlies the allegory of the soul, and is clearly in line with the "Stoic" exegesis of Gen 2:7: What is the meaning of the words, "Until thou returnest to the earth from which thou wast taken" (Gen 3:19)? For man was moulded not only and "knew that they were naked" (Gen 3:7). This literal interpretation does not appear in Philo's works, however; in Op. 151-2, the first sexual act apparently follows directly upon the creation of woman; cf. Cher. 61-4. 32 See, for example, L.A. 3.109-10, Q.G. 1.45 and 1.46. 33 Q.G. 1.53.</page><page sequence="10">KARINAKARINA MARTIN HOGAN 10 from the earth, but also from the divine spirit. First, it is evident that the earth-born creature was compounded out of earth and heaven. And because he did not remain uncorrupted, but made light of the commands of God, turning away from the best and most excellent part, namely, heaven, he gave himself wholly over to the earth, the denser and heav ier element. Second, if he had been desirous of virtue, which makes the soul immortal, he would certainly have obtained heaven as his lot.34 Here Adam's decision to disobey God's commandment means delib erately forfeiting the heavenly aspect of his human nature, and hence his reward in heaven. A similar interpretation which draws on the "Platonic" exegesis of Gen 1:26-7 can be found in Virt. 204-5: [The first man's] father was no mortal but the eternal God, whose image he was in a sense, in virtue of the ruling mind within the soul. Yet though he should have kept that image undefiled and followed as far as he could in the steps of his Parent's virtues, when the opposites were set before him to choose or avoid, good and evil, honorable and base, true and false, he was quick to choose the false, the base and the evil and spurn the good and honorable and true, with the natural consequence that he exchanged immortality for mortality, forfeited his blessedness and happi ness, and found an easy passage to a life of toil and misery.35 Both of the above passages ignore Eve's role in the story completely, for the sake of emphasizing what Adam willingly gave up. A different stage of exegesis places the blame for the loss of immortality primarily on Eve: Why does He, who knows all things, ask Adam, "Where art thou?" (Gen 3:9), and why does he not also ask the woman? The things said appear to be not a question but a kind of threat and reproach: where art thou now, from what good hast thou removed thyself, Ο man! Giving up immortality and a blessed life, thou hast gone over to death and unhap piness, in which thou hast been buried. But the woman he did not con sider it fitting to question, although [or: because?] she was the beginning of evil and led him (man) into a life of vileness.36 34 Q.G. 1.51; for a similar anthropology connected to Gen 3:14, see L.A. 3.161. 35 Cf. Sir 15:14-7, which implies that the choice of life or death (Deut 30:15) was presented to the first human beings as it is to every human being. 36 Qfi. 1.45. Cf. Sir 25:24, "From a woman sin had its beginning, and because of her we all die." This passage may represent the earliest stage of the exegesis of Gen 3 preserved in Philo, since its main motivation is anti-anthropomorphic (to clear God of the suspicion of ignorance).</page><page sequence="11">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 1 1 What exactly is meant by "immortality" in these passages is not immediately obvious, however. In L.A. 1.105-7, Philo explains why it is that Adam and Eve go on living and even beget children after eat ing the forbidden fruit, if God said that "in the day that ye eat thereof, ye shall die the death" (θανάτφ άποθανεϊσθε, Gen 2:17): . . . Death is of two kinds, one that of the man in general, the other that of the soul in particular. The death of the man is the separation of the soul from the body, but the death of the soul is the decay of virtue and the bringing in of wickedness. It is for this reason that God says not only "die" but "die the death," indicating not the death common to us all, but that special death properly so called, which is that of the soul becom ing entombed in passions and wickedness of all kinds. And this death is practically the antithesis of the death that awaits us all. The latter is a separation of combatants that had been pitted against one another, body and soul, to wit. The former, on the other hand, is a meeting of the two in conflict, and in this conflict the worse, the body, overcomes, and the better, the soul, is overcome. But observe that wherever Moses speaks of "dying the death," he means the penalty-death, not that which takes place in the course of nature.37 In light of this distinction, it seems clear that at least two of the passages cited above (Q.G. 1.51 and Virt. 204-5) refer to the loss of the immortality of the soul, not physical immortality, since both of them emphasize Adam's free choice of a "life of toil and misery."38 "Death," that is, the death of the soul, is the object of Adam's choice, not merely its punishment. It does not appear that physical immortality was ever an option for Adam, according to this line of interpretation. Moreover, the fact that physical death "awaits us all" is nowhere in Philo's works blamed on Adam's choice. Physical mortality is simply a given of human existence, and every person is assumed to have the same chance at spiritual immortality that was offered to Adam. Traditions Traditions about Cain and Abel in Philo That Philo considered the story of Cain and Abel in Gen 4 to be central to a philosophical reading of the Bible is apparent from the 3737 That a life of vice leads to the death of the soul is a commonplace in Philo. See, for example, Spec. 1.345, Fug. 113. 38 It is less clear that the third passage, Q.G. 1.45, refers to the immortality of the soul, another indication that it may belong to an earlier stage of exegesis.</page><page sequence="12">KARINA MARTIN HOGAN 12 fact that he devotes three full treatises (De Sacrificiis Abelis et Caini, Quod. Detenus Detenus Potion Insidian Soleat and De Postentate Caini) and parts of others to its exegesis. If the bulk of each of these treatises may be considered digressions from the subject at hand, this is because the story of Cain and Abel evokes so many themes dear to Philo's heart. Only the theme of the relation of sin to death will be treated here, naturally. Once again, non-allegorical interpretations will be given preference, since they are more likely to reflect pre-Philonic exegesis. One of the problems with the story of Cain and Abel that troubles many readers is that Cain seems to get off practically scot-free: although he is banished, he is protected by God from being killed (in fact his death is never mentioned), and he goes on to found a city. Many of the interpretations in Philo address this problem by arguing that, appear ances to the contrary, the fate of Cain was actually worse than that of his innocent brother Abel. According to one reading, the first homi cide was actually a suicide: God, however, in His loving-kindness will neither cause a being of an inviolable kind to be the victim of a passion, nor will He hand over the pursuit of virtue to a mad murderer for ruin. So the words that follow, "Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him" (και άπέκτεινεν αύχόν; Gen 4:8), suggest, so far as superficial appearance goes, that Abel has been done away with, but when examined more carefully, that Cain has been done away with by himself. It must be read in this way, "Cain rose up and slew himself" (και άπέκτεινεν εαυτόν), not someone else. And this is just what we should expect to befall him. For the soul that has extirpated from itself the principle of the love of virtue and the love of God, has died to the life of virtue. Abel, therefore, strange as it seems, has both been put to death and lives: he is destroyed or abolished out of the mind of the fool, but he is alive with the happy life in God.39 This interpretation is based on the אל תיקרי technique that is familiar from rabbinic exegesis, whereby a small alteration in the text is pro posed which alters the meaning significandy.40 Philo (or his source) does not really substitute the alternate reading for the standard one, how ever, but rather combines them, since he acknowledges that Abel was 39 Del. 47-8. 40 Although the technique is much more suited to Hebrew than to Greek, in this case a much more radical change would have to be made in the Hebrew text to yield the meaning "he killed himself." Thus the exegetical motif is likely to have originated in a Hellenistic milieu.</page><page sequence="13">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 13 killed in the physical sense. Other details of the story are then used to reinforce the point that, for a righteous person like Abel, physical death is no great loss, whereas the death of the soul means a life of misery: What is the meaning of the words, "The voice of thy brother calls to me from the earth" (Gen 4:10)? This is most exemplary, for the Deity hears the deserving, even though they are dead, knowing that they live an incorporeal life. But from the prayers of evil men He turns away His face even though they enjoy the prime of life, considering that they are dead to true life and bear their body with them like a tomb, that they may bury their unhappy soul in it.41 But if Cain's punishment simply consisted of spiritual death, how was this any worse than what befell his parents, whose sin surely had not been as great? Philo preserves several traditions that address this problem. One is a contrast of the banishment of Adam and that of Cain, which seems to belong to the stratum of tradition that holds Eve principally responsible for the expulsion from Eden: Adam, then, is driven out by God; Cain goes out voluntarily. Moses is showing us each form of moral failure, one of free choice, the other not so. The involuntary act, not owing its existence to our deliberate judg ment, is to obtain later on such healing as the case admits of, "for God shall raise up another seed in place of Abel whom Cain slew" (Gen 4:25). This seed is a male offspring, Seth or "Watering," raised up to the soul whose fall did not originate in itself (ψυχή xfj μή παρ' έαυτης τραπείστ!). The voluntary act [of Cain], inasmuch as it was committed with forethought and of set purpose, must incur woes forever beyond healing.42 Note that this comparison contradicts the insistence on Adam's free choice found in many of the interpretations of Gen 3 cited above. Another passage implies a contrast between the consequences of the Fall of Adam and Eve and the punishment that Cain deserved: What is the meaning of the words, "Everyone who finds me will kill me" (Gen 4:14), inasmuch as there were no other people but his parents? First of all, he was likely to suffer harm from the parts of the world which were made for the use and participation of good men but none the less 41 Q.G. 1.70; compare the second point in Qfi. 1.76 (on Gen 4:15), which begins: "Second, immediately at the outset, [Scripture] wishes to describe the law of the incor ruptibility of the soul and to refute the false belief that this bodily life alone is blessed." 42 Post. 10-11 (a more literal translation of the passage cited in Greek would be "the soul which did not turn aside of its own accord").</page><page sequence="14">14 KARINA MARTIN HOGAN exact punishment from the wicked. Second, because he feared the attacks of beasts and reptiles, for nature produced these for the punishment of unjust men. Third, perhaps one may think of his parents, to whom he first brought new grief and their first misfortune, as they had not known what death is.43 "Death" is used in a purely physical sense here, and the author of the passage seems to consider no form of misfortune or punishment to be worse than physical suffering and death. Thus, it almost certainly reflects a very early stage of exegesis, probably prior to the distinction between physical and spiritual death. Significantly, there is no passage that takes into account Adam's spiritual death and contrasts it with the punishment of Cain.44 It is not possible to provide an adequate summary of the exegesis of Gen 1-4 in Philo because so many conflicting traditions are repre sented. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to point out the most important issues to which the various exegetical traditions are responding. The first is the body-soul dualism which was common to both Stoicism and Platonism, although formulated in very different ways by the two philo sophical schools. All of the interpretations of Gen 1:26-7 and 2:7 find biblical support for the idea that the human mind or spirit partakes of divinity (in either a fragmentary or a mimetic sense), while the body is either insignificant or a liability. The double-creation tradition goes so far as to imagine that there could be such a thing as a disembod ied human person (in the realm of ideas, of course). The idea that the spiritual part of the human person is potentially immortal comes to the fore in the interpretations of the sin of Adam (and Eve). The fact that Adam and Eve do not die on the day that they eat of the tree from which God forbade them on penalty of death to eat generates the interpretation that the consequence of disobedience to God is the ultimate death of the soul. It is with the story of Cain and Abel that the problems of the untimely death of the righteous and the apparent triumph of the wicked are confronted. Support is found in Gen 4 for the idea that the souls of the righteous dead are alive to God, and that certain sins bring about the immediate and irrevocable penalty of 43 Q.G. 1.74. Cf. Virt. 200, where Philo suggests that immediate death was too good for Cain; rather, God "held suspended over him a multitude of deaths—deaths which made themselves felt in a constant succession of griefs and fears, carrying with them full apprehension of the miseries of his most evil plight." The same idea is developed at length in Praem. 69-73. M The significance of this omission is discussed in note 68.</page><page sequence="15">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 15 spiritual death. Some passages that seem to belong to an early stage of interpretation present Cain's sin as far more grave than Adam's, but it is unclear whether later interpreters made any distinction between the punishments of Adam and of Cain, since each is said to have incurred spiritual death. The The Creation of Man in Wisdom The author of Wisdom makes a number of allusions to both Genesis accounts of the creation of man which reveal his familiarity with some of the exegetical traditions found in Philo. The clearest such allu sion occurs in a passage (Wis 15:8-11) describing a man who "molds" (πλάσσει) from clay a "vain god" (θεόν μάταιον)—an ironic inversion of Gen 2:7.45 The passage concludes, "... [the potter's] life is more worthless than clay, because he was unaware of the one who molded him (τον πλάσαντα αύτόν), and inspired him with an active soul (έμπνεύ σαντα αύτφ ψυχην ένεργοϋσαν), and breathed into him a living spirit (έμφυσησαντα(έμφυσησαντα πνεΰμα ζωτικόν)" (15:10b-ll, my translation).46 Here the author takes for granted the "Stoic" interpretation according to which the πνοή of Gen 2:7 is understood to be a part of the divine πνεΰμα and is equated with the human ψυχή (cf. L.A. 1.36-8, above). A simi lar identification of the soul with πνεΰμα occurs in Wis 2:2-3, which also alludes ironically to Gen 2:7. The ungodly are lamenting their mortality: ". . . for the breath (πνοή) in our nostrils is smoke, and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts; when it is extinguished, the body will turn to ashes, and the spirit (πνεΰμα) will dissolve like empty air" (2:2c-3). Since the ungodly "reasoned unsoundly" (Wis 2:1), their characterization of the πνεΰμα as subject to dissolution when the body dies is presumably false from the author's point of view, or rather not universally true.47 45 On Wisdom's parodies of the Creadon accounts, see Maurice Gilbert, "La relecture de Gen 1-3 dans le livre de ia Sagesse" in La creation dans I'Orient Ancien, ed. Fabien Blanquart (Paris: Editions du Cerf, 1987) 336-9. 46 Unless a more literal translation is required to make a point, all translations from Wisdom will follow the NRSV. 4' Although the presence of the ungodly at the judgment scene (4:20-5:13) suggests to some readers (e.g., Weisengoff, "Death and Immortality", 105) a continuation of their existence after death for the purpose of punishment, the author's comment immediately following the speech of the ungodly (5:14) implies that the annihilation they expected will in fact befall their souls (see also 3:10). The author leaves no room for doubt about the fate of righteous souls, however: their reward is eternal life with God (5:15).</page><page sequence="16">16 KARXNA MARTIN HOGAN The universality of physical mortality, by contrast, is associated with the fact that the first man was formed from the earth (Gen 2:7). Pseudo Solomon acknowledges, "I also am mortal, like everyone else, a de scendent of the first-formed child of earth" (Wis 7:1). In light of the exegesis of Gen 2:7 found in Philo, it is likely that for Pseudo-Solomon being formed from the earth symbolizes the material or bodily aspect of human existence. Similarly, in the aforementioned passage about the potter, the brevity of human life is expressed in terms of its earthly nature: "With perverse industry, he molds from the same clay a vain god—he who was born from the earth a short time before, and returns after a little while to the place from which he was taken (έξ ης έλήμφθη; cf. Gen 3:19 LXX), when the time comes to return his borrowed soul" (Wis 15:8, my translation). The potter's folly consists not in the belief that objects made by human hands are divine (in 15:12-13, the author insists that an idol-maker's only motive is profit), but in the failure to recognize the implications of his own material existence. Two conclu sions about Pseudo-Solomon's interpretation of Gen 2-3 can be drawn from these two allusions. First, even though he apparently believes Adam was a historical person, the "first-formed father of the world" (Wis 10:1), he reads the creation story as a symbolic explanation of the human condition. Second, while Pseudo-Solomon views physical mortality as an inheritance from Adam, he mentions it not in the con text of Adam's sin, but in connection with his being formed from the earth (7:1). Thus, he apparently assumes that material existence entails mortality. This assumption may be compared to Philo's description of the "molded man" of Gen 2:7 as "by nature mortal."48 The significance of an allusion to Gen 1:26-7 in Wis 2:23 is some times missed because of a tendency to read 2:23-4 together as a neat summary of the "Creation and Fall." If read in the context of what precedes it, however, 2:23 is clearly not about physical immortality, lost through the sin of Adam and Eve, but about spiritual immortal ity, still attainable through a life of righteousness. "And [the ungodly] did not know the mysteries of God, nor did they hope for the reward of holiness, nor did they choose (or: discern—έκριναν) the prize for blameless souls. For God created man for incorruption, and made him the image of His own eternity [or: own nature] (εικόνα της ιδίας άιδιότητος [ιδιότητος])" (2:22-3, my translation). From the context, it is clear that 48 Op. 134.</page><page sequence="17">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 17 it is the soul, not the whole person, that was created for immortality and is the image of God's eternity (or nature).49 This interpretation is in keeping with every stage of the exegesis of Gen 1:26-7 found in Philo: it must be with respect to the mind or soul that the human per son was created in the image of God. The author of Wisdom does not make a distinction between ψυχή and νους; he distinguishes only between the potentially immortal spir itual part of a person, and the mortal body. At one point, Pseudo Solomon represents the body as an obstacle to human reasoning: "For the reasoning of mortals is worthless, and our designs are likely to fail; for a perishable body weighs down the soul, and this earthly tent bur dens the thoughtful (or: anxious) mind" (Wis 9:14-15). Unlike Philo, however, he blames neither the body nor sense-perception for leading the mind into sin.50 Moreover, he is not consistent in identifying the self exclusively with the spiritual part of the person. For example, in Wis 1:4, divine Wisdom is said to avoid both "a deceitful soul" and "a body enslaved to sin". In another passage, the author's first incli nation seems to be to identify the self with the body, but he corrects himself: "As a child I was naturally gifted, and a good soul fell to my lot; or rather, being good, I entered an undefiled body" (Wis 8:19-20). Nevertheless, when Pseudo-Solomon speaks of immortality it is always in terms of the soul; there is no hint of a hope for bodily resurrec tion.51 In his view of the afterlife, Pseudo-Solomon is every bit as "Hellenized" as Philo. Pseudo-Solomon's prayer in chapter 9 also begins with an allusion to the creation of man, this time recalling that the first human being was created "in order that he might have dominion" ('ίνα δεσπόζη) over the rest of God's creatures (Wis 9:2, my translation; cf. Gen 1:28). He goes on to elaborate this role in terms more suited to a king than to humankind in general: "and rule the world in holiness and righteous ness, and pronounce judgment in uprightness of soul" (9:3). Yet Pseudo Solomon emphasizes that he prays for wisdom as "a man who is weak and short-lived, with little understanding of judgment and laws" (9:5). The author's royal persona heightens the tension between human 49 It makes no difference to the argument which reading is preferred, since eternity is generally believed to be an attribute of the nature (or proper being) of God. 50 See C. Larcher, OP, Etudes sur le lime de la Sagesse (Ebib; Paris: J. Gabalda, 1969), 266-8. He points out that in 4:11-12, where one might expect a mention of the right eous being relieved of the temptations of the flesh, only external evils are mentioned. 51 Pace Taylor, "Eschatological Meaning," 131-7.</page><page sequence="18">KARINAKARINA MARTIN HOGAN 18 limitations and the responsibilities of power, but the allusion to Gen 1:28 suggests that this tension is built in to the human condition. Without the help of divine Wisdom, Pseudo-Solomon's prayer acknowl edges, no human being can accomplish the purpose for which human ity was created (9:6, 13-15). Wisdom Wisdom Wisdom on Adam's Sin The same outlook on the human condition is encapsulated in the brief allusion to Adam's sin in Wis 10:1-2: "[Wisdom] protected the first-formed (πρωτόπλαστον) father of the world, when he alone had been created; she delivered him from his own transgression (έκ παρα πτώματος ιδίου), and gave him strength to rule all things."52 The epithet πρωτόπλαστος recalls Wis 7:1, where mortality is assumed to be the natural result of humanity's being formed from the earth. There is no suggestion in this verse that mortality—or indeed any bad consequence— came about as a result of Adam's transgression. Divine Wisdom saw to it that Adam could continue to fulfill the role for which he was ere ated, namely "to rule all things." Even as he downplays the gravity of the expulsion from Eden, Pseudo-Solomon does not minimize Adam's sin by pinning the blame on Eve. Instead, he completely ignores her role in the story, insisting that Adam was all alone in the world and emphasizing that his transgression was his own. In this respect, his interpretation parallels those passages in Philo in which the Fall is char acterized as the first man's autonomous choice of evil over good (see above, Q.G. 1.51 and Virt. 204-5). Yet the emphasis on the resultant loss of spiritual immortality is lacking in Wis 10:1-2. This may be because Pseudo-Solomon intends to contrast the sin of Adam with that of Cain, a point to which we will return below. Wisdom contains another probable allusion to Gen 3, however, which seems to establish a connection between the disobedience in Eden and the origin of death. I am, of course, referring to the highly-disputed verse, 2:24: "but through the devil's envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his company experience it." I argued above that in the preceding verse, the "immortality" for which humanity was ere ated is the immortality of the soul. Likewise, the "death" whose etiol ogy is given in this verse cannot be simply physical mortality, since only those who belong to Death's (or the devil's) company or lot expe 52 NRSV omits the word "own," which may be quite significant, before "transgression."</page><page sequence="19">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 19 rience it.53 It must mean either spiritual death while a person is still alive, which Philo describes as "the soul becoming entombed in pas sions and wickedness of all kinds,"54 or the "ultimate death" of body and soul together, which is the way the ungodly envision death and the way they will in fact experience it (see Wis 3:10, 5:14). According to Kolarcik, the argument of the book requires that "death" in 1:13 and 2:24 signify what he calls "ultimate death," since Pseudo-Solomon's point is that the righteous and the ungodly experience physical death in fundamentally different ways.55 Therefore, Wis 2:24 explains the ori gin not of physical mortality, but of wickedness and its consequence, the ultimate death of the soul. Wis 2:23-4 claims that God's original plan for humanity was upset at some point by "the devil's (or adversary's) envy." Although a case can be made for reading this as an allusion to Cain's murder of Abel (the arguments will be reviewed below), a comparison with roughly contemporary exegetical traditions suggests that the primary reference is to the temptation of Eve by the serpent. The fact that Eve is not mentioned is admittedly puzzling, but it is in line with the author's essential denial of her existence in 10:1. In Rev 12:9, "the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world" are mentioned as alternative names for "that ancient serpent," which most commentators take as an allusion to Gen 3.55 Second Enoch 31:6 says quite clearly that the devil, taking on the form of a serpent, "entered paradise, and corrupted Eve."57 The identification of the serpent with Satan is also taken for granted in Life of Adam and Eve 10-17, where Satan explains that his motivation for pursuing Adam and Eve was envy, since he had been expelled from heaven for refusing to worship Adam as the image of God. Even though all of these works are probably somewhat later than 53 The Greek is ambiguous as to whose company those who experience death belong, but in 1:16 the ungodly are said to be worthy of Death's company, with Death clearly personified. 54 L.A. 1.106 (see above). 55 Kolarcik, Ambiguity, 176-7. 56 See, for example, J. Massyngberde Ford, Revelation (AB 38; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1975) 206. In the context of a more obvious allusion to Gen 2-3, the mother of seven sons says in 4 Macc 18:8 . . nor did the Destroyer, the deceitful ser pent, defile the purity of my virginity." See Kugel, Bible, 72-4. 5' Translation of F.I. Andersen in Charlesworth, ed., Old Testament Pseudepigrapha 1. 154. Allusions to this tradition also occur in Apoc. Ab 23, Apoc. Mos 16:4 and 3 Bar 9:7. These allusions are cited by David Winston, The Wisdom of Solomon (AB 43; New York: Doubleday, 1979) 121-3.</page><page sequence="20">20 KARINA MARTIN HOGAN Wisdom, they independently attest to what must be an older tradition. The fact that Philo does not mention the tradition that the serpent was the devil does not necessarily mean that he was ignorant of it. His philosophical reading of the Bible simply does not admit the existence of Satan.58 In general, Pseudo-Solomon is also loath to "give the devil his due." The other passage that is often cited as evidence for the author's view of the origin of death is Wis 1:12-16. There again, the death that "God did not make" (1:13) seems to be something other than common mor tality.tality. After asserting that "righteousness is immortal" (1:15), the pas sage concludes: "But the ungodly summon [Death] by their deeds and words; considering him a friend, they pine for him and make a pact with him, because they are worthy of his company" (1:16, my trans lation).59 Pseudo-Solomon's purpose in this passage is to clear God of blame for human wickedness and its consequence, spiritual death. Although it would have been convenient to bring in the devil at this point, he prefers to hold the ungodly fully responsible for their fate. Even if one would argue that death as personified here is the func tionaltional equivalent of the devil,60 the fact remains that the ungodly sum mon him, not vice versa. Similarly, as Pseudo-Solomon is explaining in chapter 14 why idolatry is "the beginning and cause and end of every evil" (14:27), he insists that "through human vanity [idolatry] entered the world" (14:14). The wording of 14:14 echoes 2:24a, but the responsibility for evil is shifted back to human beings. Yet in the context of the creation of man for immortality (2:23), Pseudo-Solomon apparendy felt compelled to offer a "biblical" explanation for the ori gin of spiritual death, and that entailed mentioning the involvement of "the devil" in Adam's transgression. Some commentators have proposed that ό διάβολος in 2:24 refers 8נ Giinter Mayer (Index Philoneus [Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1974]) records no occur rence of the term Σατανάς, and only one of διάβολος—as a common adjective, "slan derous," one of a long list of attributes of the pleasure-lover in Sac. 32. 59 I have translated the aorist verbs in 1:16 in the present tense because they are gnomic aorists: the verse describes the habitual actions of the ungodly, rather than a moment in the past when they collectively "summoned death." Winston, although he notes that the verbs are gnomic aorists (Wisdom, 113), retains the misleading past-tense translation. 60 Yehoshua Amir ("Figure of Death," 158) maintains that Death and the devil are identical for the author of Wisdom, but this leads him to treat 2:24 as a nonsensical statement (161). Given that the devil is mentioned only in 2:24, Amir's position is difficult to comprehend.</page><page sequence="21">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 21 not to the serpent of Gen 3, but to Cain, "the adversary" of the right eous Abel.61 This argument draws support from the context of 2:24, which follows the speech of the ungodly plotting the murder of the righteous man (2:12-20). On this reading, Cain is a type for the wicked oppressors of the righteous who choose spiritual death for themselves by inflicting physical death.62 While this interpretation fits well with what the author has to say about Cain in 10:3-4 (see below), it does not explain how a reader, coming across 2:24 first, would be able to figure out that 6 διάβολος meant Cain. It is possible to infer from Gen 4 that envy was the motive for Cain's murder of Abel, but there is no evidence that first-century readers did infer it, much less that an allusion to "the envy of the adversary" would cause anyone to think immedi ately of Cain. Envy—φθόνος—is one of Philo's pet vices; he mentions it in more than 40 different passages, yet never in connection with Cain.63 Nor does Josephus mention envy in his expansion of the Cain and Abel story in Ant. 1.52-66. Therefore, it is unlikely that 6 διάβολος in 2:24 refers to Cain. The primary allusion must be to the serpent of Gen 3. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the author had Cain and Abel in mind as well when he wrote 2:24. Pseudo Solomon may have thought of Cain's murder of Abel as the occasion on which death actually "entered the world," even though Adam and Eve had first "summoned death" (1:16) through their disobedience. In other words, he may have read the story of Cain and Abel as the cul mination of the "Fall" story.64 Wisdom Wisdom on Cain's sin Even if Gen 4 is included in the allusion in 2:24, the only passage in Wisdom that clearly refers to Cain's sin is 10:3-4a: "But when an unrighteous man rebelled against [Wisdom] in his wrath, he perished 61 According to Winston (Wisdom, 121), this was the suggestion of H. Bois, in Essai sursur Us origincs de la philosophic Judeo-AUxandrinc (Toulouse, 1890), taken up by J.A.F. Gregg in his commentary on Wisdom (Cambridge, 1909). More recendy, it has been argued by John R. Levison, Portraits of Adam in Early Judaism from Sirach to 2 Baruck (ISPSup 1; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1988) 51-2. 62 Levison, Portraits, 51. 63 Mayer, Index Philoneus.Philoneus. 64 This is the way the second-century Christian apologists Irenaeus of Lyons (Adv. Haer.Haer. 1.30.9) and Theophilus of Antioch (Ad Autolycum 2.29) apparently read Gen 3-4, probably influenced by Wis 2:24. Theophilus clarifies the connection between the devil's envy and death: Satan's envy intensified when he saw that not only were Adam</page><page sequence="22">22 KARINA MARTIN HOGAN together with (συναπώλετο) [his brother] in a fratricidal rage. When the earth was flooded because of him, Wisdom again saved it..(my translation). Even from this brief allusion, it is obvious that Pseudo Solomon's reading of Gen 4 is heavily influenced by traditional inter pretations. First, Cain is the only individual in Wis 10 who is singled out as an άδικος—even the collective enemies of each "δίκαιος" are not called άδικοι. Thus, even though he does not mention the right eousness of Abel, Pseudo-Solomon apparently views Cain's murder of Abel as the archetype of all wrongdoing.65 In fact, it is "because of him" that God decides to destroy the world with a flood (10:4). Since there is no exact parallel for this explanation of the flood,66 we can only speculate about why Pseudo-Solomon believed God waited ten generations before destroying sinful humanity. It may have been to give them an opportunity to repent (cf. 12:10 etc.). In any case, far more significant for our purposes is the idea that Cain "perished together with" (or "destroyed himself along with") Abel (10:3).67 If συναπώλετο referred to Cain's physical demise, it would be a blatant contradiction of Gen 4:16-17. It is much more likely that it reflects the tradition, preserved in Philo (Det. 47-8), that Cain destroyed his own soul at the moment when he took his brother's life. Although Pseudo-Solomon generally presents the death of the soul as the outcome of a lifetime of ungodliness, he may have believed that there were certain sins grave enough to seal a person's fate irrevocably. The question remains, does Pseudo-Solomon believe that spiritual death "entered the world" at the same moment as physical death (i.e., with Cain's murder of Abel), or had Adam already experienced spirit ual death as the consequence of his transgression? The latter option, of course, would bring Pseudo-Solomon's exegesis of Gen 3 into line and Eve still alive, but they were bearing children, and one of them, Abel, was pleasing to God. So he induced Cain to kill Abel, and "from these beginnings death was intro duced into this world, and it pervades the whole human race to this day." Irenaeus also blames the serpent for corrupting Cain, "in order that by killing his brother Abel, he might first show [the world] jealousy and death." Winston (Wisdom, 121-22) cites both passages but does not recognize them as attempts to reconcile Wis 2:24 with Gen 3-4. 65 For Cain and Abel as types for the wicked and the righteous, respectively, see Kugel, Bible, 90-92. 66 The closest parallel Kugel (Bible, 99) can offer is Test. Adam 3:5, where it is implied that the "daughters of men" in Gen 6:1 were specifically Cain's daughters. 67 The verb συναπόλλυμι means "perish together" in the passive; the form συναπώλετο could also be understood in a middle sense, in which case it would mean "destroy one self along with" someone else. Most translations have simply "perish," omitting the sense of simultaneity that is crucial to the interpretation.</page><page sequence="23">THE "AMBIGUITY OF DEATH" IN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON 23 with the non-allegorical interpretations preserved in Philo. The prob lem is, there is no hint in Wisdom that Adam incurred any irrepara ble damage by disobeying God's command. Instead, divine Wisdom .. delivered him from his transgression, and gave him strength to rule all things" (10:1-2). If Adam had forfeited the immortality of his soul, such an outcome would have been impossible. The first thing Pseudo-Solomon says about divine Wisdom is that she "will not enter a deceitful soul, or dwell in a body enslaved to sin" (1:4). It appears that, faced with the alternative that Adam and Cain were subject to the same punishment, Pseudo-Solomon chose to regard Adam's disobe dience as not sufficiently serious to merit immediate spiritual death. Given that he read the story of Adam as that of humanity in gen eral, and that he believed that spiritual immortality was within human reach, he could hardly do otherwise.68 Thus, perhaps we must read Wis 2:24 as follows: although spiritual death "entered the world" when the devil tricked Adam (alone or with Eve) into disobeying God, Cain was the first person to "experience" it by choosing to belong to the devil's company. Conclusions Conclusions Because Pseudo-Solomon's allusions to Gen 1-4 are relatively few and mostly rather cryptic, a comparison of his exegesis of these chap ters with that found in Philo must be somewhat speculative. The task is complicated further by the various, often contradictory, levels of inter pretation preserved by Philo. Nevertheless, it is possible to draw a few tentative conclusions. First, the author of Wisdom shows familiarity and essential agreement with the earlier stages of exegesis of the creation of man found in Philo; namely, the anti-anthropomorphic and single creation stages. He makes no reference to the double-creation inter pretation of Gen 1:26-7 and 2:7, but we have no way of knowing whether he was unaware of it, actively disagreed with it, or simply found it too speculative for the purposes of a protreptic discourse. Like 68 The same dilemma may have motivated Philo himself to prefer reading Gen 2-3 as an "allegory of the soul", since the more literal interpretations could not reconcile the severity of Adam's supposed punishment with the veniality of his sin, relative to that of Cain. A rabbinic solution to this problem was to infer that Cain had repented (and Adam had not), and to use the story to teach the power of repentance. See George Foot Moore, Judaism in the First Centuries of the Common Era: The Tannaim (2 Volumes; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1927) 1. 524-25, 530; cf. Kugel, Bible, 96.</page><page sequence="24">24 KARINA MARTIN HOGAN Philo, Pseudo-Solomon takes for granted that physical mortality is an inevitable property of material existence, and that the only kind of immortality that was ever within human reach is that of the soul. Since Pseudo-Solomon is well aware of the concept of spiritual death, it seems likely that he knew of the tradition that the consequence of Adam's disobedience was spiritual death, and rejected it. It is even more prob able that he renounced any interpretation that blamed Eve for Adam's sin, since he consistently avoids mentioning her. Pseudo-Solomon ap parendy affirms the tradition that the death of Cain's soul was the immediate result of his murder of Abel. It is hard to tell exactly what connection he sees between "the devil's envy" and the first murder, but it is clear that he views Cain as the archetype of all evildoers. A comparison of the exegesis of Gen 1-4 in Wisdom and Philo lends support to Kolarcik's thesis that death is an ambiguous concept in Wisdom. On the face of it, the suggestion that an author would use the same terms to refer to two quite different things—the death of the body which is common to all and the ultimate death of the soul which is the lot of the wicked—is hard to swallow. Kolarcik demonstrates the rhetorical effectiveness of such ambiguity, but one might still question whether Pseudo-Solomon's audience would have caught on to the double meaning of death. Assuming that current interpretations of Gen 1-4 were preached in the synagogues of Alexandria, we can be fairly certain that they would have gotten his point more easily than present day readers do. The concept of spiritual death was apparendy adopted by Alexandrian Jews to deal with two exegetical problems in Gen 1-4: why Adam and Eve did not die as threatened after eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and why Cain was barely pun ished for killing his brother. While the explanation that all three were punished with spiritual death (either immediately or at the end of their lives) may have been ultimately unsatisfying, it would have popularized the notion that the death of the soul is more to be feared than the death of the body. We will never know whether this "philosophical" view of death gained widespread acceptance among Hellenized Jews. Yet it must have been familiar enough in Alexandria that Pseudo Solomon could assume general comprehension of his admonition, "Do not invite death by the error of your life, or bring on destruction by the works of your hands" (Wis 1:12).</page></plain_text>
