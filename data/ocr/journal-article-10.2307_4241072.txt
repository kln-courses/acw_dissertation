<plain_text><page sequence="1">186 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) Philippe Mather Figures of Estrangement in Science Fiction Film The need of many film critics to distinguish science-fiction film from science- fiction literature by focusing on medium-specific properties appears to betray an almost institutional inferiority complex vis-a-vis literary analyses. Reacting to the attitude of critics such as Carl Freedman, in his normative essay on Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Brooks Landon insists on the non- narrative tradition of film-as-spectacle and the centrality of special visual effects in sf film (63). I have argued elsewhere that the genre's distinctive traits are not tied to formal, aesthetic, or stylistic criteria, but rather to thematic and contextual factors (127-34). Therefore, any attempt to characterize sf film's audiovisual properties can usefully be derived from what I consider to be the genre's conceptual matrix, Darko Suvin's twin notions of cognition and estrangement. Landon argues persuasively that sf literature and sf film "can be better understood through a critical approach that looks for previously unnoted similarities and parallels as well as for divergences" (xvii). His unapologetic promotion of certain contemporary non-narrative forms of sf can be infectious, but it sidesteps the fact that narrative remains the dominant mode of sf film. Landon even makes an (ahistorical) ontological argument about the film medium's roots in spectacle rather than narrative that contradicts his informal definition of sf as "the literature of change" (xxvi). I share Landon's interest in analyzing "film's way of concretizing science fictional concepts in film rather than just in the stories conveyed by the medium" (83), but I will attempt to show that the rhetorical/semiotic approach I am advocating can productively accomplish the task of characterizing sf film's formal strategies without severing its ideological ties to other forms of sf, including literature. This article is based on the conviction that the rhetorical notion of figure is sufficiently flexible to allow for a rigorous and exhaustive study of the many forms of estrangement one finds in sf film. To the extent that it relies on the genre's conceptual matrix (cognitive estrangement), the typology of figures I am proposing is an attempt to go beyond simple description in order to explain how the figures work-i.e., how they create meaning. I will seek to identify patterns characterizing the genre as a whole, bracketing specific questions of historical and cultural context for methodological reasons. This study is therefore not a comprehensive theory of sf film: it focuses on semantic, aesthetic, and especially syntactic concerns. Tracing historical and cultural variations, and accounting for the pragmatic, contextual dimensions of the genre's discourse, would constitute a valuable topic for analysis and would complement the analysis proposed herein. From a semiotic point of view, figures of estrangement concern the syntactic dimension of sf. This particular analysis proceeds from philosopher Charles</page><page sequence="2">FIGURES OF ESTRANGEMENT IN SF FILM 187 Morris's tripartite semiology, originally formulated in 1938. The sign's syntactic dimension concerns its relationship with other signs (figures), semantics is the relationship between the sign and its referent, and pragmatics concerns the relationship between the sign and its users-i.e., the discursive contexts. Sf images and sounds do not necessarily announce their generic identity. Certain contextual factors must be taken into consideration. The most important of these factors is a given film's status as sf. The marketing of a film, for instance, may determine how the film will be read, creating generic expectations and activating the dominant reading protocols associated with the genre. This article's primary focus will be syntactic, identifying sf film's figures of estrangement. In Darko Suvin's theory of sf, estrangement is the genre's formal parameter, which can be described in at least three different ways. First, from a phenomenological perspective, the fictional worlds of sf are experienced as different, in varying degrees, from a degree-zero world. This degree zero is the consensual representation of reality that is shared by the implied author and reader of a given film's original communicational context (Suvin 4). Second, estrangement can also be considered as the genre's overall discourse. The reader expects to be engaged in a fictional thought experiment, one that uses some innovation to construct a possible world, a variation on the reader's own world. This referential aspect of sf's discourse is designed to provide a new, distanced perspective on the consensual world. Finally, estrangement is also a rhetorical effect created by the use of specific stylistic devices that I call figures of estrangement. Carl Malmgren has suggested that it may be useful to employ the term "defamiliarization" (a concept borrowed from the Russian Formalists) to describe the effect of such stylistic devices, while the term "estrangement" could be reserved for the genre's overall discourse (26). Figures of estrangement share an underlying general principle that functions in a dialectical fashion. In her study Screening Space, Vivian Sobchack argues that unlike the western or detective genres, sf film does not have an iconography that can be considered essential (65-66). Images of spaceships or robots or post- nuclear terrains will certainly trigger expectations linked to an sf narrative, but these images aren't necessary to the genre. Therefore, the visual and acoustic specificity of the genre rests in the ways the images and sounds are organized to create an estranged world. Sobchack classifies these images and sounds in three broad categories: the alien, the familiar, and an intermediate category that mixes the previous two. According to Sobchack, it is the tension among these categories that is specific to sf (87). In the category of the alien, Sobchack argues that there are degrees of alienness ranging from the least to the most alien, from extrapolative to speculative images (88). Speculative images aim at abstraction, at going beyond the anthropomorphic limits of our imagination in an attempt to represent the truly alien. The Stargate sequence in the "Jupiter: Beyond the Infinite" section of 2001 is an example of such an attempt, as are the alien point-of-view (POV) shots in such films as Westworld (1973), Robocop (1987), and Predator (1987). Extrapolative images and sounds are not intrinsically alien, but are made strange through the narrative context. One option is to use extremes in scale such as the</page><page sequence="3">188 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) macrophotography of ants in Phase IV (1974), images of planets from outer space (usually accomplished through special effects), or the internal view of a man's lungs and arteries in Fantastic Voyage (1966). An acoustic example would be the alternation between the breathing sound of the astronaut and complete silence in 2001: it simultaneously reminds us of certain physical facts (sound doesn't travel in a vacuum) and highlights the earthbound nature of space-opera movies like Star Wars (1977) that feature noisy spaceships. The sense of wonder created by sf's estranged worlds is the bait or sugar- coating that allows the genre's cognitive or didactic dimension to operate. First, in order to make sense of alien images and sounds, these elements tend to be naturalized in various ways. For instance, the characters in the fiction will behave as though these alien sights and sounds are normal, everyday occur- rences. The second category is that of familiar images and sounds. In the same way that alien images are naturalized, familiar images are made strange in various ways. This binary system can be represented as follows: Alien Familiar Speculative/Extrapolative naturalization 4 4 alienation Sobchack lists three subcategories of familiar images that can be made alien (110). The first concerns the topography of natural and urban locales. In The Road Warrior (1981), the Australian desert in New South Wales is made strange by referring to it as a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The city can become strange if it has been deserted in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust-as in On the Beach (1959)-or a world-wide plague, as in The Omega Man (1971). It can also be transformed by increased modernization and decay, as in Freejack (1992) or Blade Runner (1982). The second subcategory of familiar images is the alienation of human characters. On the paranoid end of the spectrum, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and The Thing (1982) are effective examples of the process of creating anxiety over who has become a pod, who has been taken over by an alien life-form and who has not. Characters can be distorted with fish-eye lenses or through their acting style, indicating that they have become insane or even inhuman. Thirdly, ordinary everyday objects can become strange in the proper narrative context. Sobchack's best example is the scene in Soylent Green (1973) in which Charlton Heston brings back some luxury items to his apartment, and we're made to wonder at the sight of a bar of soap, a stick of celery, an apple, some beef, etc. (131). This is the perfect illustration of the Russian formalist notion of defamiliarization: the prolonged focus on an ordinary object in order to make it strange, to consider it anew in a different light. Sobchack proposes a final category in which the images and sounds contain both alien and familiar elements (137-44). This does not appear useful from a theoretical perspective. Estrangement functions rather as a dialectic, and the categories of the alien and the familiar are always present in sf images and sounds in varying proportions. The complementary principles of naturalization</page><page sequence="4">FIGURES OF ESTRANGEMENT IN SF FILM 189 and alienation create a kind of centripetal force that prevents either of the two categories from being completely absent at any given time. This is due to the sf context of the narrative. The alien is naturalized by a familiar object, and the familiar object is made strange in an unfamiliar context. In order to analyze this process, however, it may be useful to determine which of the two terms is dominant at any given time. The Gestalt Psychology notion of figure and ground can provide a solution. The figure (not to be confused with a rhetorical figure) always dominates the ground, but it may be an alien or a familiar figure. For instance, Godzilla is an alien figure dominating the familiar ground of Tokyo, whereas Captain Kirk is a familiar figure dominating the alien ground of outer space. To complicate this idea, one could add the notion of "figure and locale" developed by French art historian Pierre Francastel, which was applied to film by the late semiologist Michel Colin (89). Here, the figure is any object or person that is separated from the locale by means of its movement or narrative function. So, the idea of "figure and locale" is a formal, syntactic one, whereas "figure and ground" is an interpretive one that establishes a hierarchy between the figure and the locale. Imagine an extreme long shot of the aforementioned Captain Kirk dwarfed by an alien environment in which he finds himself. The location dominates the human character. The alien environment is thus a figure in the Gestalt sense (and Kirk is the ground), but remains a locale in a syntactic sense, just as Kirk remains a syntactic figure. Sometimes, the relationship between the alien and the familiar is not contained within a single image. It may take several successive images or even an established narrative context in order to determine this relationship. For instance, in the scene from Soylent Green featuring close-ups of beef, celery, and an apple, each food is entirely familiar. The food is only made strange thanks to the characters' reaction shots and their explanations about the narrative situation. The abstract imagery at the end of 2001 represents an opposite example: a few reaction shots of the suffering astronaut in his pod are required in order to place the alien imagery in some sort of familiar context. Having established the dialectical principle of estrangement, one can then attempt to determine the various ways in which this general principle manifests itself concretely, in terms of film images and sounds of differing durations and various narrative functions. I've indicated my intention to use the rhetorical concept of the figure to accomplish this. A rhetorical figure can be defined as a formal configuration of the discourse that changes the proper or literal meaning of the word or image. A figure is noticed or felt by the reader/viewer each time the expression used distinguishes itself from a banal or neutral one. The reader's intuition in this regard may be theorized by the complementary notions of norm and difference. Given a norm or a degree zero for any type of discourse, the rhetorician varies it to create specific meanings or effects (Mu Group 168). The notion of degree zero, introduced by Roland Barthes in an essay first published in 1953, was borrowed for the analysis of cinema by Noel Burch. Burch claims that classical editing constitutes "the 'zero point of cinematic style'</page><page sequence="5">190 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) that reigned supreme during the 1930s and 1940s and still remains in a position of some strength today" (15). The very idea of a "classical" cinema implies the existence of a norm based on the conception-and underlying ideology-of a "transparent" filmic discourse. Film semiotician Jurij Lotman also describes meaning in film through a "mechanism of differences" that opposes unmarked elements (neutral, anticipated, "cleansed of associations") to marked elements (displacement, deformation, contrast, violation of expectation) (32). In his study The Classical Hollywood Cinema, David Bordwell attempts to list the formal properties that characterize the classical style. He first describes the technical aspects of Hollywood cinema, such as the three-point lighting system, nondiegetic and inaudible film music, the continuity editing system, including the code for punctuation (e.g., fades, wipes, dissolves), different types of cuts, the shot/reverse-shot pattern and the 1800 rule, etc. (6). He also proposes another list of properties defining "film noir." As a representational practice that is opposed in certain ways to so-called classical cinema, film noir constitutes a difference from the norm. The formal characteristics of film noir include night lighting, location shooting, decentered and/or canted framings, the use of flashbacks and disorienting subjective imagery, etc. (76). Bordwell points out that despite these differences, film noir obeys the psychological logic that underlies Hollywood narrative film. For instance, classical cinema stricto sensu also uses figures in order to express moments of suspense, of tension and conflict between the characters. In his theory of filmic enunciation, Christian Metz argues that neutral images do not exist. Only images differing from a nonexistent norm do (168). How can one then differentiate among the various images? The marks of enunciation are present in each filmic sound/image, but in varying degrees: evaluating the deviation is always accomplished with reference to a "ghostly anchor" known as the degree zero (168). Even though the norm has no concrete existence, it nevertheless possesses a strong cultural reality that allows the reader/viewer to appreciate stylistic effects that necessarily distinguish narrative fiction from texts that have no artistic or expressive claims (170). The norm is thus a limit, an empty category without which one could not place the "full" categories in proper perspective. The latter categories are always defined in reference to a negative or null concept of the zero-point (170). The rhetorical figure is thus a formal configuration of the discourse characterized by a difference from the norm of classical or "transparent" cinema. The discourse of sf consists in using figures that emphasize the genre's thematic specificity, the potential effects of science and technology. The notion of norm and difference in rhetoric produces a dialectic that can be compared with that of estrangement (or alienation) and naturalization as described above. The figure is also inherently reflexive, since we are supposed to notice the difference from the norm. This reflexivity of the figure implies a cognitive potential as concerns the content of the discourse that is paralleled on a thematic level in sf by the genre's focus on scientific issues. Thanks to the notion of degree zero, the Belgian Mu Group was able to bridge the gap between the linguistic and the semiological in order to develop</page><page sequence="6">FIGURES OF ESTRANGEMENT IN SF FILM 191 a general rhetoric and, in particular, a typology of figures of narration. The Mu Group theorists borrowed the Danish linguist Louis Hjelmslev's chart illustrating the "structure of the linguistic sign": Substance Form Expression: phonic field sound signs SIGN Content: semantic field concepts This version concerns only the grammar of natural languages. In order to account for the narrative arts, the Mu Group modified the chart thus: Substance Form Expression: novel, film, comic narrative strip, etc. discourse NARRATIVE SIGN Content: real or imagined story (re'cit) universe, real or fictive stories (histoires) It is this "semiotic structure of the story" (184) that has served as a theore- tical basis for my own typology of figures of estrangement in sf cinema. Articulating the figures is the result of a two-step process: first, identifying the norm from which figures will differ and, second, retaining only those that reflect the sf genre's thematic and syntactic specificity-i.e., cognitive estrangement. The first category of figures (top left in the chart below) concerns the material makeup of film, the "substances of expression." The category of form (right side of the chart below) refers to narrative codes per se. The substance of content (bottom left in the chart below) deals with so-called "figures of thought." There is thus a movement from more literal to more abstract types of figures. Substance Form Expression: 1) moving image 1) time 2) word as image 2) chronology 3) dialogue 3) causality 4) music 4) space 5) sound FX 5) POV NARRATIVE CODES Content: 1) irony 1) kernels 2) allegory 2) characters 3) antithesis 3) informants 4) actants</page><page sequence="7">192 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) Substance of expression. Film semiologist Christian Metz has argued that film has five substances of expression. The image-track includes moving images and written words, and the soundtrack includes dialogue, music, and sound effects. Each of these five substances can be manipulated in various ways to create a figure, and in each case, it is essential to determine the figure's aesthetic function. As soon as a relatively abstract image or sound satisfies a precise narrative function, it belongs in another category. For instance, if a fish- eye lens is used to express a sense of estrangement, it will remain a figure of the substances of expression so long as it isn't associated with a specific character's POV. Inevitably, some figures will have two aspects and will thus belong to two categories. What Sobchack calls the "word as image" (199) can have a connotative aspect through the typography and also provide narrative informa- tion: this would be a figure of the substances of expression as well as the form of content. Moving image. There are naturally many figures that are not specific to sf, and so it is useful to focus on those that have the genre's characteristic scientific themes. A figure of the moving image might be the closing shot from Soylent Green. The film ends with Charlton Heston's imploring gesture as he screams: "Soylent green is people!" A freeze-frame (the image no longer moves, thus differing from the norm) is followed by an optical zoom-in (a la the closing shot of 400 Blows [1959]). Heston's arm is then recentered, with additional graphical emphasis provided by black borders, changing the image's format from the usual horizontal landscape to a vertical portrait. Lastly, the dissolve from Heston's arm to a field of tulips focuses on the arm's shape (a stem) and the bloody hand (petals). This metaphor transforms his desperate gesture into a more hopeful sign-i.e. the possibility that lives may be saved thanks to his sacrifice. Another figure of the moving image in sf film would be the "' unrepresentable" image, such as astronaut David Bowman's multicolored eye at the end of the Stargate sequence in 2001. This is an attempt to suggest something that cannot be shown since it is unknowable, a form of superhuman consciousness. Bowman's multicolored eye suggests a displacement in time and space as well as the protagonist's gradual metamorphosis. The extreme close-ups of his eye emphasize his status not only as "looking subject" but also as victim. Finally, the eye represents the spectator's viewing activity. The abstract nature of the imagery in this sequence encourages a reflexive reading, one that requires a self-conscious form of interpretation. Paradoxically, since the unrepresentable cannot be shown, the only solution is to fold the sign onto itself in order to suggest a kind of transcendence. Word as image. Written words can be used in a figurative way: numbers and mathematical symbols often have scientific connotations and are a standard trope in sf, from Metropolis (1927) to The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970). Nondiegetic titles or business cards will only be figures of the substances of expression if their typeface or typography is unusual in some way. One example would be the futuristic typeface used within the diegesis of several sf films, in particular Rollerball (1975).</page><page sequence="8">FIGURES OF ESTRANGEMENT IN SF FILM 193 Dialogue. The focus here is on the voices' timbre rather than the content of the dialogue. At times, distinguishing between dialogue and sound effects can be a challenge. In a film like THX-1138 (1971), it is never clear whether some of the electronic transmissions are meant to be understood or only heard in the background. A voice emerging from animals, extraterrestrials, or machines is an anthropomorphic example of estranged dialogue-what Sobchack calls "displaced voices" (178). In the Star Trekuniverse, as Sobchack also points out, the majority of extraterrestrials conveniently speak English (147); producers must have felt that the public would rather hear dubbed aliens than read subtitles. The opening scene of the film Star Trek: Generations (1994), featuring Klingons who speak in their native tongue, is subtitled. After a few exchanges, however, they switch to speaking English with a vaguely Eastern-European "Klingon" accent. Computers and robots are often given machine-like voices, including HAL in 2001, who ends up singing "A Bicycle Built For Two" in an estranged fashion as he is systematically disconnected by the astronaut Bowman. Ironically, HAL's death is more moving that of Frank Poole's, and if one considers how little difference there is between the sound of THX's supervisors and the police robots in THX-1138, it becomes clear that the categories of human and machine are often blurred in sf, as Blade Runner amply demonstrates. Music. Broadly speaking, music can either empathize with the characters (this is the standard practice) or it can be at odds with their state of mind, even offering ironic commentary. In terms of sf's estrangement, the use of banal music can naturalize the image, or dissonant atonal music can be a factor of alienation. In her study of narrative film music, Unheard Melodies, Claudia Gorbman proposes a useful distinction between musical, cultural, and filmic codes (2). Musical codes concern the tonal system, the classical rules of harmony and counterpoint that regulate the varying degrees of consonance and dissonance, or the alternation between tension and resolution that constitutes an important aspect of musical signification. Perhaps the most relevant aspect of musical codes concerns the dominant style of film music, late-nineteenth century romantic orchestral style. This style functions as the norm, and other styles would constitute figures. Among these styles, the most atonal is probably contemporary avant-garde music. A good example is the Gyorgy Ligeti music used in 2001: Heywood Floyd's ride from moonbase Clavius to the TMA-l site on the moonbus is accompanied by Ligeti's LuxAeterna (1966). This choral piece has pure, linear, and crystal-like acoustic qualities that seem to match the moon's desolate, cold, sterile surface. The rhythm is imperceptible, and the held notes are relayed by the singers so as to create an uninterrupted flow. They modulate around neighboring semitones, giving the eerie impression that the tonality is slowly shifting. Ligeti's Atmospheres (1961) is used for the famous Stargate sequence. It is an orchestral piece that develops the technique of the cluster, a group of notes that are all a semitone apart. Some clusters in Atmospheres include four complete octaves, which creates an impressive wall of sound. During what looks likes a supernova explosion, an ascending cluster reaches the highest notes of the piccolo flutes.</page><page sequence="9">194 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) It is suddenly interrupted by the sharply-contrasting lowest notes of the double- bass. The timbre of electronic instruments also creates interesting estrangement effects-e.g., the "electronic tonalities" of Louis and Bebe Barron for the film Forbidden Planet (1956). Cultural codes concern the rhythms and melodies of well-known musical styles such as folk, military, Native American, and Asian music. They also include the orchestration stereotypes developed in nineteenth-century French melodrama and used more recently in animated cartoons: suspense ostinati, dramatic sforzando chords, violin or flute for the love interest, tuba for the fat man, saxophone for the vamp, etc. Unusual orchestration can create a figure: when the astronauts run towards the waterfall in Planet of the Apes (1967), the sound of tuned metallic bowls creates, along with the hand-held camera, a sense of urgency and excitement. The bowls are not normal musical instruments, but their piercing sound adds a reflexive element to the soundtrack, since they temporarily violate the standard rule of inaudibility for narrative film music. Filmic codes include narrative codes that are not part of the substances of expression stricto sensu such as point-of-view, Wagnerian leitmotifs associated with characters or narrative situations, didactic counterpoint, montage sequences, and credits sequences. Music during the end credits is a strong filmic code, so its absence is particularly noticeable. The endings of Phase IV and Planet of the Apes do not contain any music, but simply the sound of the wind or waves crashing on the beach, which deprives us of the usual emotional catharsis, creating instead a dramatic distance. Sound FX. The norm for sound effects is fidelity to the image, to the represented object or person. Sobchack's distinction between mechanical, natural, and alien types of sounds can be used to classify the different figures of sound effects (217-18). The mechanical sound includes computerized sounds. The mainframe computer in Colossus imitates the human heart by producing a variety of beeping sounds. In 2001, alarm signals combine to create a particu- larly irritating effect when Bowman prepares himself for his dramatic entrance through the emergency airlock. This effect is made strange by its contrast with the silence that follows. As mentioned above, using natural sounds instead of music during a film's closing credits creates a sense of distance. The viewer is left to grieve over the death of the narrative. Sobchack argues that the category of alien sounds typically combines technological and biological sounds in an attempt to suggest something that has never been heard before, and to question the separation between the technological and the biological (218). Form of expression. The dominant form of cinema is defined not only by the substances of expression, but also by narrativity. The axis of form, in the semiotic structure of the story, includes all of the narrative fumctions or codes. The Mu Group suggests that the main figures of the form of expression are the following five types of narrative functions: relations of time, chronological direction, causal determination, spatial localization, and point of view (190). The form of expression concerns the discursive aspect of the story (recit)</page><page sequence="10">FIGURES OF ESTRANGEMENT IN SF FILM 195 whereas the form of content concerns the content of the story. It is important to keep in mind that this distinction between the form of expression and the form of content is not identical to that between story (histoire) and discourse developed by Emile Benveniste, Gerard Genette, and Christian Metz. The Genettian notion of histoire is close to that of diegesis, whereas the recit is the story in its material aspect, a notion for which David Bordwell borrowed the Russian term syuzhet-roughly but not quite equivalent to "plot" (Narration 50). Time. Concerning relations of duration, the norm in film is that screen time is inferior to story time. Obvious ways to differ from the norm and thus to create figures include fast and slow motion. 2001 features one of the most celebrated match cuts in film history when Moon-Watcher's bone/tool/weapon is replaced by a spaceship in orbit around the Earth. Slow motion is used to achieve this poetic temporal ellipsis of four million years. The freeze-frame is another way to manipulate duration. The closing shot from Soylent Green functions like the last held note or chord in a musical piece. It possesses a cathartic function reminiscent of the last shot in George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). The "reverse-shots" of Bowman in 2001 naturalize the abstract imagery. They allow us to place the imagery in a narrative context, but many of the shots are also still frames. One could speculate that Bowman's trip through space and time occurs in a different time frame. In relative terms, the astronaut's journey may only last a few seconds. The imagery is thus shown at a slower pace in order for us to appreciate it (a situation also explored by Robert Zemeckis in Contact [1997]). In other words, the still shots of Bowman are perhaps not discursive intrusions in the diegesis, but moments slowed down to the point where they appear frozen in time. The goal is to illustrate the notion of the relativity of time, a common sf idea. Chronology. The norm for acts and chronology implies that events unfold in chronological order. The time-travel scenario often involves a time loop in which events are determined by what happens both in the future and the past. The time loop is a figure in itself, a logical paradox that some would describe as science fantasy rather than sf. Both The Terminator (1984) and 12 Monkeys (1996) employ the time-loop figure. Causality. A standard means of manipulating the train of events and causal determination is to withhold narrative information from the viewer or from certain characters to create mystery or suspense. This figure is used in many sf films, including the detective-story structure of Murder in Space (1985). Space. The 1800 rule and continuity editing constitute the norm for the representation of space. In terms of the fictional topography, many sf films include long shots or extreme long shots as a means of establishing and naturalizing the estranged futuristic space. During Bowman's extra-vehicular activity (EVA) in 2001, the sound of the astronaut's breathing remains in the foreground, despite a cut to an extreme long-shot of the spaceship Discovery while a meteor is shown drifting in the foreground. One recognizes the cognitive aspects of such a spatial figure: in astronomical terms, the meteor just missed hitting the ship, and since space is a vacuum, one hears the constant volume of</page><page sequence="11">196 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) the astronaut's radio broadcasting. Another cognitive figure is the systematic canted framings used during the same EVA sequence, which highlight the fact that notions of up and down are meaningless in the absence of gravity. A spectacular spatial figure is the cognitive revelation, which might be considered a metadiscursive figure in that it reflexively highlights the sf genre's discourse. This occurs when a scene is shown in one or several close shots, following which the camera suddenly pulls back to give us greater perspective on the event. In recent sf film, this figure has become more common with the use of computer graphics. The Arrival (1996) features a dramatic pull-back from a scientist examining the surprising climactic conditions on the North Pole. A more ambitious revelation in astronomical terms takes us from a domestic scene on Earth to a general view of our galaxy at the beginning of Contact, and a similar astronomical pull-back at the end of Men In Black (1997) situates our universe in a game of marbles played by alien beings. Point of view. The norm for point of view is that of an impersonal or transparent narration. One can distinguish between artifical POV (robots and computers), alien POV, and estranged human POV. In 2001, HAL's POV is shown via a fish-eye lens, which provides an ironic counterpoint to the computer's claims about his infallibility: how can one trust a cyclops with a figuratively and literally distorted vision? There are interesting examples of alien or perhaps mutant POV in Phase IV, in which we are offered the grid-like view of the insects' multi-faceted eyes, and in Predator, with the infrared heat- sensitive vision of the alien. Form of content. The Mu Group's list of figures of the form of content is borrowed from Roland Barthes's famous " Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives" published in 1964 (7). Barthes sought to describe the ways in which various story (recit) elements were organized or structured, rather than merely to study them on a semantic level. Those elements are the kernels, the characters, the informants, and the actants. Kernels. The idea of the kernel is an attempt to account for the common observation that certain narrative events are more important than others. Barthes calls the secondary events "catalyzers" and argues that there exists a hierarchy of narrative events: the kernels are indispensable to maintain a coherent story while the catalyzers are descriptive extensions (15). The kernels are the frame or the skeleton, and the catalyzers are the body or flesh of the story. Given that its function is to insure the story's logical coherence, the kernel's norm is to conform to the dominant narrative forms' rules of verisimilitude. Generally, kernels represent pivotal moments in the story structure, scenes or sequences where the plot changes direction or where the characters' fates are modified. Any descriptive kernel whose tone is noticeably different from the rest of the story can be considered a figure as well as any modernist strategy that undermines, even slightly, the cause-and-effect chain that forms the basis of the story's logic. A frequent kernel figure in sf film is didactic dialogue. The actor-as-narrator figure occurs when one character stands in for the narrator/implied author and</page><page sequence="12">FIGURES OF ESTRANGEMENT IN SF FILM 197 another character stands in for the narratee/implied audience. In the second episode of the BBC miniseries Invasion: Earth (1998), two characters have been kidnapped by unseen aliens. The scientist explains to the other character that their captors are Nds-N-dimensional creatures-and illustrates this concept by referring to a world possessing only two and three dimensions. This is an intertextual reference to Edwin Abbott's 1884 sf novel Flatland. Another figure is the formal speech or expose in which the narratee is more impersonal, embodied by a crowd or an audience rather than a character. In the film Event Horizon (1997), the concept of hyperspace is explained to the ship's crew by scientist Sam Neill using a folded piece of paper and a pencil as heuristic devices. A more reflexive form of didactic dialogue manifests itself whenever the speech is conducted through a technological medium such as TV or radio. This usually involves frames within frames: in the film Jurassic Park (1993), the idea of cloning a prehistoric animal is illustrated via a cartoon designed for a theme park. Characters. The question of characterization in sf has generated much critical literature, its most simplistic formulation being Kingsley Amis's catch- phrase "idea as hero" (137). In traditional rhetoric, characters can be described physically or morally, and in sf, non-human characters (artificial or extraterres- trial) also constitute a figure. An interesting example of the physical portrait occurs in Colossus when the computer turns its new spying "eyes" on Dr. Forbin, its creator. This is an effective example of defamiliarization: the most ordinary aspects of the human face are made strange in this physical examination by a machine whose status as sentient being is still undecided. The scene also happens to be shown through the computer's POV, thus combining two figures at once. There are examples of the non-human portrait, or anthropomorphosis, in Phase IV: the geometric symbols on the ants' "foreheads" are particularly disturbing, since they imply an intelligence not normally associated with such life-forms, extending the fractal geometry of the insects' multifaceted eyes to unnatural manifestations of intelligence such as the geometric patterns in the field. Informants. These are elements of the fictional world or diegesis that make up the spatiotemporal environment, and the norm would be a transparent, unheightened environment. The Mu Group lists three informants: places, objects, and actions (209). The distinction between places as informants and the representation of space can be a subtle and difficult one, revealing the overlapping nature of these figures. In each case, it is important to determine whether the focus is on the form or the content of the spatial figure. A good example of the space as informant occurs in Soylent Green after the priest is murdered: an establishing shot of the market pans slowly to the left, followed by four closer shots of stallholders selling shoes, plates, and buns. The scene lasts almost a minute, and there is no forward movement in the plot. Christian Metz would likely refer to this as a descriptive syntagma: its discursive function is to describe a cultural place in this polluted dystopia.</page><page sequence="13">198 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) The norm for objects as informants is that they conform to their normal use in reality. In addition, they should not clutter the space nor should they be non- existent. The monolith in 2001 is an unidentified object that has an important symbolic function. An outstanding example of defamiliarized objects in sf occurs in a scene from Soylent Green described previously, when the characters marvel at the sight of real food. Figures of gestures or actions in sf could include the close-up of a character pressing a button. The countdown in Star Wars, when the Death Star destroys Princess Leia's home planet, features such close-ups of characters interfacing with a machine. The defamiliarization is made more acute by the discrepancy between the otherwise banal action of pressing a button and its catastrophic results. Actants. To analyze the relationship between characters and their narrative functions, the Mu Group used the diagram developed by the linguist A.J. Greimas in his Structural Semantics, published in 1966. The diagram includes three binary oppositions: the subject/protagonist and the object of the quest, the opponent and the helper, and the addressor and the addressee. The norm is that there should be one character for each function, and that there should not be any reversals during the course of the story. When HAL kills Poole in 2001, one character is eliminated, which in itself can be considered a figure. More importantly, the computer's status changes from helper to opponent. Bowman's metamorphosis at the end of the film also changes the identity of the subject and thus the object of his quest. He becomes a transcendent figure whose motivations we can only guess at and may not comprehend. Substance of content. In Hjelmslev's modified diagram, the substance of content concerns semantics, that immaterial field common to all semiotic phenomena. If it is immaterial, however, how can we conceive of formal configurations of the substance of content? Traditional rhetoric includes the category of "figures of thought, " which typically affect larger portions of a text and have an intermittent or diffuse quality. For instance, irony and allegory can be read literally or figuratively whereas a metaphor can only be read figura- tively. Recognizing figures of thought is therefore a pragmatic concern, since it depends on contextual factors involving the spectators, their expectations, and the reading protocols they apply. In the category of figures of thought, one can include irony, allegory, and antithesis. Irony. Elements of irony are quite noticeable in 2001. Heywood Floyd behaves like a bored businessman in an airport terminal when he is travelling in the orbital space station, and his dialogue is banal in the extreme. Floyd's speech on the moon is inadequate: his inept and casual delivery contrasts with the importance of what he is saying. He remembers, almost as an afterthought, that the staff must provide formal security oaths in writing. Floyd sounds as if he is organizing a picnic and reminds everyone to bring umbrellas in case of rain. On board the spaceship Discovery, astronaut Frank Poole appears thoroughly bored and embarrassed when he receives a ridiculous birthday message from his parents. A game of chess follows, which HAL claims to have enjoyed as though he were forcing himself to be nice. Ironically, HAL seems as bored as Frank. The men cannot be distinguished from the computer on an emotional level. HAL</page><page sequence="14">FIGURES OF ESTRANGEMENT IN SF FILM 199 pleads with Bowman in an ironic fashion just before he is disconnected. The computer's dull pronunciation contrasts with the drama of the situation. When HAL suggests that Dave take a tranquilizer, he seems to miss the astronaut's zombie-like demeanor. The computer's professed "enthusiasm for the mission" sounds hypocritical given his soporific tone of voice. Allegory. Planet of the Apes represents a clear example of this figure. Scenes and dialogue throughout the film are designed to comment on the text's and the spectator's world of reference via the artifice of a simian world. Both worlds are compared systematically in expressions or sentences such as "human see, human do"; "apes come from a lower order of primates, probably man"; and "the Almighty created the ape in his own image." An ape priest delivers a eulogy at a simian funeral: "He was a model for us all, a gorilla to remember. The dear departed once said to me: 'I never met an ape I didn't like'." In a tribunal, three orangutan judges pose like the three wise monkeys: "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil." Antithesis. This figure of thought can manifest itself in a plot's overall structure as in dialectical form (thesis, antithesis, synthesis). The alignment of various stellar bodies with the monolith in 2001 signals important moments of transition. The opening shot depicts the moon, the Earth, and the sun in perfect alignment, with Richard Strauss's three-note opening to Also Sprach Zarathustra (C-G-C, do-sol-do). This piece symbolizes the evolution of the human race from Australopithecus to Homo Sapiens and finally to the Starchild. In the "Dawn of Man" segment, proto-humans touch the monolith, an action followed by a low- angle alignment of the monolith with the sun and the moon. A close-up of Heywood Floyd on the moon touching the surface of the monolith four million years later rhymes with the previous "touching," followed once again by the astral alignment. The suggestion is that there has been no evolution at all. The last alignment occurs prior to the Stargate sequence when an improbable vertical alignment of Jupiter and its moons is matched with a horizontal view of the monolith. This formation accidentally (?) creates a cross (which has been the source of religious misinterpretations by some viewers). Considering 2001's structure from a dialectical perspective, it could be argued that the film's thesis is contained in the Dawn of Man section prior to the monolith's intervention. It introduces us to the proto-human before our ancestor is told how to use a tool as a weapon. The film's antithesis is embodied by the armed hominid rather than Homo Sapiens, a point emphasized by the absence of a title card to separate the prehistoric section from Heywood Floyd's section. Furthermore, the famous graphic match between the bone and the spaceship suggests a continuity, minimizing the differences between these two periods. The tool created by man appears to turn against its creator, and Bowman overcomes the challenge in the "Mission Jupiter" section. The film's synthesis is a result of this confrontation between the thesis and its antithesis: the metamorphosis orchestrated by the monolith in the "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite" section. Strauss's Zarathustra is heard again at this point, underscoring the figure of thought.</page><page sequence="15">200 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) Conclusion. This typology of figures of estrangement in sf film has been based on several postulates. First, the notion of figure can be defmed as a formal configuration of the discourse in which the meaning of the word, the image, or the sound is modified from its literal or proper meaning. From a phenomeno- logical perspective, this is based on the idea of norm and difference. The reflexivity of the figure implies a cognitive potential as concerns the content of the discourse, which is paralleled on a thematic level in sf by the genre's scientific episteme. In addition, the notion of norm and difference produces a dialectic that can be compared with that of estrangement (or alienation) and naturalization, which I have analyzed as sf's underlying rhetorical principle. The generic specificity of the figures rests in their thematic connection to the scientific episteme. While helpful, Vivian Sobchack's analysis of the processes of alienation and familiarization in sf images and sounds is ultimately limited by its theoretical inability to recognize the relational nature of estrangement, which makes the combined category of alien and familiar images redundant. Furthermore, her analysis does not fully exploit the ramifications of estrangement as a discursive and rhetorical gesture, including questions of narrative structure. I have shown that the sf genre's conceptual matrix of cognitive estrangement affects every level of sf film's discourse and not only images and sounds conceived as an essential and film-specific category.

New Haven: Yale UP, 1979. ABSTRACT This essay offers a descriptive system intended to address film-specific phenomena in terms consonant with Darko Suvin's analysis of the forms of estrangement found in sf literature. I propose a semiotic analysis of sf film, focusing on a typology of figures of estrangement, conceived as a centripetal relation between processes of alienation and naturalization. My typology of figures is based on Louis Hjelmslev's chart illustrating the structure of the linguistic sign as adapted by the Belgian Mu Group. Since the sf genre's distinctive traits are not tied to medium-specific criteria, I argue that a structural approach can usefully characterize sf film's formal strategies without severing its rhetorical and ideological ties to other forms of sf, including literature.</page></plain_text>
