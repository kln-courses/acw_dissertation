<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rectangular Mushroom Stones from Oaxaca, Mexico Ulrich Köhler Introduction I would like to présent here further examples of a category of Mesoamerican stone artifact which have come to be known as "mushroom stones". Regarding the function of these archae ological objects no unanimity has as yet been reached. Earlier interprétations such as phalli or seats have been dismissed and are no longer discussed. The same would hold for the sugges tion of Rose, quoted in Mayer (1977:1), who visualized them as moulds for the production of rubber balls. For such globular objects, however, two concave moulds could possibly have been useful, not a convex one like the cap of a mushroom stone. Thus we are left with two major lines of interprétation. They will be tested against the new archaeological material presented here. The first of these diametrically opposed interprétations was proposed in the early sixties, and visualized these stone artifacts as idols in a sacred cult involving psychedelic mush rooms. This conclusion was reached by relating two facts: on the one hand, the mushroom stones, mainly found in the highlands of Guatemala, and on the other, the ritual or thera peutic ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms as practiced by a few groups of Mexican Indians. While not entirely opposed to this line of thought, Mayer (1975:67) cautioned on the basis of his comparative research that none of the objects he had seen had mushroomlike gills on the lower side of the cap. The other interprétation is my own (Köhler 1976) and suggests a practical function of the stone objects, that of potters' moulds. It was mainly based on ample ethnographie parallels (- good examples for this technique, widespread in</page><page sequence="2">Mesoamerica, are found in Foster (1955, 1967), Christensen (1966), Reina and Hill (1978:165-171, 187-189)), and was also supported by convex archaeological ceramic moulds as the missing link bridging the gap to the archaeological mush room stones. This pragmatic approach was partly applauded (Isaac 1986:2) but, as Mayer (1990:102) sums up in a recent article, the association of the stone objects with psychedelic mushrooms still seems to be the principal line of thought. The Objects from Oaxaca In the Museo Frissell de Arte Zapoteca of Mitla four mush room stones are on exhibit, two of them with a round head (C, D), the other two (A, B) with rectangular ones. The latter are of special interest and will be discussed here. The other two are also reproduced, because they add new forms to the wide spectrum of those already known. Fig. 1 shows A from the side, Fig. 2 the same specimen from another angle, Fig. 3 depicts C (left) and B (right), and Fig. 4 shows D.

Discussion Is there a reason for not placing these artifacts from Oaxaca in the "family" of mushroom stones? I cannot see any. We thus have to redefine this class of objects as "stone artifacts with a round or rectangular stem and a round or rectangular convex cap". This, of course, puts an end to all spéculation about a relationship between mushroom stones and hallucinogenic mushrooms. Since there is no mushroom species with a rectangular hat, the hypothesis concerned has been entirely refuted. Furthermore, with its réfutation the principal basis for a postulated ritual ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms by Mayan priests or rulers has vanished. Having deposited the said hypothesis in the box of past errors, we now have to confront the remaining hypothesis with the same material. Could rectangular mushroom stones have been potters' moulds? Technically there is no problem. As a matter of fact, by giving clear guides for angles and the lengths of sides such a kind of mould would be even more useful when building rectangular vessels than in the case of round ones. It is much easier to produce round vessels and for that reason they are the rule. Just like rectangular mushroom stones, rectangular ceramic vessels are not fréquent in Mesoamerica, but there are examples from différent areas, such as Chichén Itzá (Coggins and Shane 1984:128), the Aztec area (Vega Sosa 1975:23) and also Monte Albán (Caso and Bernal 1965: 875, 879) and Yagul (Bernal y Gamio 1974, Lámina 52) in Oaxaca. At La Lagunita near Tehuantepec a fired clay frieze has been found, consisting of bricks which show a rectangular hollow at the front side (Delgado 1965:10). Modeling this design, rectangular mushroom moulds could possibly have Fig. 4. Stone D. Museo Frisseil. Photo: U. Köhler. been useful. As moulds, the two rectangular mushroom stones depicted here would seem to have been especially useful in shaping slightly convex lids of rectangular boxes. After achiev ing the basic form, a knob would have had to be added to such Covers. If the objects had been excavated scientifically, there would have been a chance to compare the stone artifacts directly with the ceramic material from the same site. But as things are, we can only becry the disastrous effects of looting on archaeological research. Nevertheless, whoever digs up a rectangular mushroom stone in the future should have a close look at the site's ceramics. References cited Bernai, Ignacio y Lorenzo Gamio 1974 Yagul.

RESUMEN: Se confrontan las dos interpretaciones principales acerca de la función de hongos de piedra mesoamericanos con objetos rectanguales del mismo tipo, hasta la fecha ignorados. Por la no existencia de hongos rectangulares, la hipótesis de que los hongos de piedra hayan sido ídolos en la veneración de hongillos alucinógenos queda rechazada. En cambio, su interpretación como moldes de alfareros pudo pasar la prueba.</page></plain_text>
