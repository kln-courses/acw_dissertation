Grosholz Women Do Sciences from Below: Feminisms, Postcolonialities, and Modernities By Sandra Harding Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2008, 283 pp., $22.95, paperback ng Science Motherhood, the Elephant in the Laboratory Edited by Emily Monosson Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press / ILR Press, 2008, 219 pp., $25.00, paperback Late-twentieth century philosophy of science banished many topics from philosophical discussion, until philosophy of science became almost purely a matter of epistemology, or theory of knowledge, heavily indebted to a certain form of logic that had consciously and willfully sacrificed expressiveness for formal considerations. In view of the global economic, environmental, and political crises we face, the unwillingness of philosophers to talk about the moral and political dimensions of science in relation to its characteristic modes of rationality and empirical investigation is especially to be regretted. After that long silence, there is no ongoing discussion to redirect toward our current problems; philosophers as a group are unprepared for the task. Sandra Harding, in her recent book Sciences from Below, addresses this task. The book is not easy to read, in part because it is an ambitious compendium of many disparate discussions (about postmodernism, postcolonialism, and feminism in relation to scientific rationality), whose integration here is only partly achieved, and in part because Sandra Harding is not a fluent writer. However, the philosophical?and human?imperatives that led her to write this book are extremely important, and the book itself opens possibilities that philosophers must explore. Sciences from Below begins with a review of the work of the French anthropologist Bruno Latour, the German sociologist Ulrich Beck, and the European (British and Austrian) research group of sociologists, Michael Gibbons, Helga Nowotny, and Peter Scott. So, Harding is trying to show North American philosophers that the writings of Europeans working in what are deemed to be distinct fields are pertinent to their concerns. In his Politics of Nature: How to Bring the Sciences into Democracy (2004), The Pasteurization of France (2005), and We Have Never Been Modern (2008), Latour argues by case studies that Western science is not universal but situated and local: the practices that we identify as science and the specific European culture in which it arose "co-constituted" each other. Thus the claims of progressiveness, cultural neutrality, and lack of anthropomorphic tendencies, and the celebrated "fact / value" distinction on which they rest, must be re-examined. Ulrich Beck argues that for too long scientists have treated matters that ought to be publicly debated by concerned citizens as technical issues that scientists can decide among themselves. But science changes the world it studies and does so in unpredictable ways; scientists must acknowledge their accountability and responsibility for vast changes in human life, and politicians must find more discerning ways to select and promote science that better serves the lives of ordinary people. Gibbons, Nowotny, and Scott note that the network of scientific investigation is now distributed among universities, industrial laboratories, and federal government laboratories, so that science is no longer confined to the ivory tower. When scientists must be more responsive to their social, economic, and political contexts, they argue, the contextual ization of research strengthens the reliability of its results. As valuable as Harding finds these reconsidera tions of modern science, she regrets a certain limita tion of perspective that keeps these thinkers from examining further assumptions about "modernity" often made by scientists, even social scientists. Progressive thought is typically opposed to the prim itive, traditional, and domestic, and domesticity is equated with the feminine. Harding reviews feminist thinkers who insist that we revise our view of histo ry and of knowledge production by focusing on women as subjects and agents rather than objects and bystanders, and postcolonial thinkers who show that other cultures have been devising their own modernities for the past couple of centuries while the Europeans were busy claiming modernity as their own peculiar invention. The last third of the book is her attempt to bring these disparate discourses together. Can we really have a humanly successful transformation and integration of science and poli tics, she asks, if the majority of the world's citizens (women, and people who do not live in Europe and North America) are set aside because their concerns and way of life do not seem "progressive"? Her most valuable suggestion is that we look for situations where "double vision" already produces, or could plausibly be brought to produce, policy decisions for a newly politicized science and a scientifically mobilized politics. Traditional societies have produced important (though not infallible) knowledge about how people can live sustainably in certain environments; and the domestic environments that have been and largely remain the domain of womenfolk are likewise a source of practical knowledge and human wisdom. We would be well-advised to stop disparaging and forgetting this collective wisdom, and instead to give it a leading role in the drama of our present global crises, as we refine the content of, and redetermine the shape of, modern science. One of my favorite examples of this double vision is the work of Wangari Maathai. The story of her Green Belt Movement, founded in Kenya in 1977, is brilliantly described in her memoir Unbowed (2007). Born in rural Kenya, she received a bachelor of science degree from Mount St. Scholas tica College and a master's in biology from the University of Pittsburgh. Upon returning home, she received a Ph.D. from the School of Veterinary Medicine in Nairobi (with some graduate study in Germany) and began teaching at the University of Nairobi. Her life's work, however, arose when she combined her scientific knowledge with the wisdom of the rural community that had nurtured her and dedicated herself to the reforestation of her country. She understood the close connection between water sources and orchards and forests, and diagnosed the environmental problems of her country?specifically the encroachment of desert? as the result of farming "cash crops" promoted by colonial speculators and their Kenyan accomplices, who didn't understand local conditions and were interested only in making fast money. Her project grew in importance, despite significant political opposition, until eventually she was voted a member of Parliament and her NGO acquired worldwide acclaim. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. A gainst this background, the life stories recorded in Motherhood: The Elephant in the JL ^Laboratory, edited by Emily Monosson, take on special significance. Every one of the 32 women (Monosson is one of them) who contributed essays to this book was determined to pursue a career in science and to raise a family at the same time. The immediate consequence of their determination was double vision! Thus as we might expect, many of the professional trajectories reported here are highly nonstandard, ranging from that of Aviva Women's Review of Books 23</page><page sequence="2">Brecher, who got her Ph.D. in Applied Physics at the University of California in San Diego in 1972 to those of women who were recently and perhaps still are graduate students in Zoology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. We might rue the fact that more of these women did not become famous scientists; or we might notice that they have changed the shape of scientific professionalism and have had a significant impact on policy studies and the politics and economics of science. Aviva Brecher, an immigr?e from Israel, started out by investigating meteorites, and indeed has an asteroid named after her. When her two children arrived, she began to work on "real-life problems" such as nuclear waste disposal, climate change, and advanced transportation systems safety, in part to leave a safer world for her children. She works for the Department of Transportation and the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. Stefi Baum, who received her Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of Maryland in 1987, began her fam ily of four children while doing research at the Space Telescope Science Institute, where she both used and maintained the Hubble Space Telescope. However, in midcareer she decided to become a Science Policy Fellow at the US State Department, where she investigated the impact of genetically modified organisms and agricultural biotechnolo gy. Then she and her scientist husband moved to the Rochester Institute of Technology, and she became Director of the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science. The science of imaging is a vast, highly interdisciplinary field, with applications cen tral to environmental studies, defense, medicine, and education. Gayle Barbin Sydlewski, a 1996 Ph.D. in Oceanography at the University of Maine, raised her son for four years and then found a soft-money position as research faculty at her alma mater, where her husband was offered a standard position. She maintains a laboratory and a graduate student, and in addition works twenty hours per week as coordinator of a local watershed council. Caroline Baier-Anderson, who earned her 1999 Ph.D. in Toxicology at the University of Maine while her children were young, became a health scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, which now has a video clip of President Obama on its website and must be an exciting place to work. She has also meanwhile become an assistant professor in the department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at the University of Maryland / Baltimore. This is a representative sampling: these women had to create nonstandard positions for themselves because academic science did not properly accommodate them and because they refused to adapt to academic science. Instead, they have become experts who manage and re-create the interactions among universities, government, and business. Sandra Harding is the only philosopher I know who can point to this emerging cohort of women scientist-policymakers and explain why they are so important. ? Emily R.
