Calcutta: The Rama- krishna Mission Institute of Culture, 1956. Pp. xix + 775. The first edition of The Cultural Heritage of India was published in 1937 and consisted of three volumes only. It has been out of print for many years and has been difficult to locate. The present edition is a considerably enlarged one, and the older articles have been brought up to date, with much new mate- rial added. This volume, like the others projected, is in a sense complete in itself, with its own bibliography and index. Volumes 3 and 4 in the series have been brought out first since they did not require such a large proportion of fresh material as the others. The editorial work on these two volumes was completed before the editor's death early in 1956. A 25-page introduction to Volume 4 has been written by Dr. Bhagavan Das, outstanding Indian savant. The remainder of the volume consists of 45 articles, 22 of which appeared in the first edition. The six major sub- divisions of the volume are: I. "Religious Sects and Cults"; II. "The Saints and Their Teachings"; III. "Religion in Practice"; IV. "Religions From Beyond the Border"; V. "Some Modern Reform Movements"; VI. "Sri Ramakrishna and Spiritual Renaissance." Volume 3 deals specifically with the philosophies of India, whereas the present volume is concerned with the religions. In one sense this is a purely arbitrary divi- sion, necessary for practical purposes and not too pertinent to the Indian approach to philosophy and religion. Philosophical thought tends to be more conceptual, logical, and systematic, whereas religious thought tends to be more poetic, mythical, evocative, and mystical. Yet traditional Indian seers would never think of trying to drive as hard and fast a line between these two emphases in man's search for a meaningful interpretation and realization of the living process, or reality, as many Occidental thinkers do, for philosophical thought, to the extent that it is truly vital in a humane sense, is existential even as profound religious searching is. An interpreter of Indian thought like Rene Gu6non goes so far as to insist that in India there is no such thing as "religion," only metaphysic. Religion, for him, is an expression of the sentiments and is inevitably anthropomorphic. Metaphysic is interested in arriving at universal truths, and the factor of sentiment is nil. How- ever, even on Guinon's own terms, there is a great deal of religion in India, for it is the popular bhakti cults which appeal to the masses at large, not the more subtle insights of the seers. Most of the sects and cults, and the accompanying rituals, saints, and hymns described in the volume under review pertain not to the phil- osophical tradition of India primarily, nor to what Guinen and Coomaraswamy have called metaphysic, but to religion as that term is commonly used in the Occident. The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture deserves commendation for its leadership in this project in making available in the English language so many excel- lent volumes bearing upon the life and thought of India. The volume is very well done and every student of Indian religions, especially those who teach college courses in the area of Indian religion, will do well to have a copy close at hand.-FLoYD H.
