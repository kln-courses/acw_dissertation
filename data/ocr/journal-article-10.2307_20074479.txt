<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Master of the Furies Frankfurt am Main by MARJORIE TRUSTED Victoria and Albert Museum, London the intensely vigorous and anguished carved ivory face of a shouting Fury on horse back (cat. no.3; Fig.75) vividly demonstrates the power of the works ascribed to the anony mous Master of the Furies. For the first time a substantial group ? seventeen in total - of the ivories attributed to him have been united in a dramaticaUy compelling exhibition, Der Furienmeister, at the Museum alter Plastik, Liebieghaus, Frankfurt am Main (to 9th July), curated by Bettina Schmitt.1 The accompanying catalogue iUustrates and dis cusses the other eight works associated with him, including one last recorded in 1957 on the London art market, whose current where abouts are unknown.2 The Master of the Furies is a mysterious figure whose identity Ues solely in the idio syncratic ivories thought to be his work, three of which are in the Kunsthistorisches Mus eum in Vienna. Over thirty years ago Erwin Neumann, then curator of the Vienna Kunst kammer, first coined this name (or gave him his personaUty, Schmitt writes), styUsticaUy linking three more ivories from other coUec tions with those at Vienna. Subsequent schol ars, notably Christian Theuerkauff, Sabine Haag and Herbert Beck, have identified fur ther pieces, thereby estabUshing a recognisable uvre. The question of the relevance or other wise of an artist's biography in relation to his or her work has often been debated, but in the case of the Master of the Furies this is not a problem, since precisely nothing is known of his Ufe. Despite intensive archival research, his dates, place of origin, training and areas of activity remain enigmatic. None of the works is signed or dated, and the one secure date which helps place the artist is 1625, when one of the ivories, a seated Lapdog in the Museo degU Argenti, Florence (no.7; Fig.76), was recorded in a Medici inventory. This early reference confirmed what had previously been supposed for styUstic reasons, that the sculptor was active in the early seventeenth century. He is now thought to have been working between about 1610 and 1620. The cluster of works now in Vienna was previous ly in the collection of the archbishops of Salzburg. It has been proposed that the artist was Austrian, and worked in Salzburg, per haps for Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau (1559?1617) or one of his succes sors. Even if he was not working specificaUy at Salzburg, he must surely have been a court artist who was aware of the production of works of art in luxury materials, goldsmiths' work, boxwood and turned ivory. Unques tionably he heralded the great era of Baroque ivory carving in northern Europe. 75. Fury on horseback (detail), by the Master of the Furies. C.1610.

The fur of the Lapdog is a tangle of spaghetti-Uke strands, while its claws are threateningly sharp. The Phoenix, a large, almost anthropomorphic bird, standing 23.8 cm. high with a wingspan of 42.5 cm. (Kunst historisches Museum, Vienna; no.4), has a similarly rich surface covered in innumerable feathers, some stuck on individuaUy, while others are separately carved in an astonishing ly naturaUstic manner which almost defies the properties of ivory. The ivory is fixed onto a concealed wood core. Like the dog, it has immense presence and, although it is com pared in the catalogue with Giambologna's bronze Turkey (Museo delBargello, Florence), it is strangely disturbing and forceful, rather than merely a fanciful bird. However, the sobriquet of the artist derives from his sculptures of Furies, one of which is in Vienna (no.2), a second, mentioned above, in the important ivory coUection of Rainer Winkler, while a third, in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, is not in the exhibition but is iUustrated in the catalogue. Two further figures of the Hesperides, in Vienna (no.9) and Berlin (no. 15), are also related in style and subject-matter to the Furies. These shrieking, energetic figures, with flying draperies and angular, awkward bodies, demand the specta tor's attention. They recaU the late Gothic art of fifteenth-century Germany, the paint ings of Gr?newald or wood engravings of the Dance of Death. Although they have a primary viewpoint, they insist on being appreciated from aU angles, and the illustra tions in the catalogue show how effective they are from different standpoints. Every piece in the exhibition displays a degree of virtuosity that wiU astound those visitors who may not be famiUar with the potential of ivory in the Baroque period. The centrepiece of the show is the figure of Marcus Curtius on horseback about to plunge into the abyss (no.5; Fig.77). It seems impUcit ly to ape, or even mock, bronze equestrian statuettes, which appear staid in comparison: the nervous rearing ivory horse is poised on its hind legs at the crest of a spiral pathway leading up from the chasm Uned with leaping ivory tongues of fire. Even the apparendy less dramatic Banner bearer from Vienna (no. 10) is a masterly sculpture: a twisting man with an enormous furled banner fixed to a staff more or less twice his height, whose drapery half-envelopes him. The instaUation of this comparatively smaU exhibition is understated and effective, the blue colour of both the waUs and the bases of the vitrines contrasting with the creamy coloured ivories, the Ughting subdy enhanc ing the sculptures' forms. All the scholarship to date on the artist is drawn together clearly and invitingly in the catalogue. The intro ductory essay by Schmitt pieces together what can be deduced about the Master's artistic identity and examines the historiography; Bettina Schindler contributes a conservation study of two of the pieces; Sabine Haag dis cusses the place of ivory in the Kunstkammer; 77. Marcus Curtius, by the Master of the Furies. C.1610. Ivory on wood socle, 57 cm. high with socle. (Museo degli Argenti, Florence; exh. Museum alter Plastik, Liebieghaus, Frankfurt am Main). EXHIBITION REVIEWS and Maraike B?ckUng explores the connec tions of the Master's pieces to ivory turning; the comprehensive catalogue entries are by Schmitt. A fuU bibUography and a transcrip tion of references to the works in early inven tories are also included. One knotty area is dating, and this reviewer found the suggested chronology of the works at times problematic. Similarly, the subject of workshop coUabora tion also poses difficult questions. How far does the quaUty of a piece justify suggesting it is early or that it is partly the product of assistants? Clearly some of the works differ in quaUty or are more or less complex, but without any external evidence it is not easy to distinguish either a styUstic development or how far the Master worked alone or with help. This exceUent exhibition wiU inevitably awaken interest in Baroque ivory carving, and the accompanying catalogue wiU certainly be the standard monograph on the artist for many years to come. 1 An eighteenth ivory, Hercules, from the Fine Arts Museum, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco (no. 14), could not be lent. 2 Catalogue: Der Furienmeister.
