Finding the Tomb of a Moche Priestess by Christopher B. Donnan and Luis Jaime Castillo The Peru Moche Moche between had kingdom no a.d. writing flourished 100 system, and on 800. the they Although north left coast a vivid the of Peru between a.d. 100 and 800. Although the Moche had no writing system, they left a vivid artistic record of their beliefs and activities on beautifully modeled and painted ceramic vessels. Because of the realism and detail of these depictions we are able to reconstruct various aspects of Moche society such as religious ceremonies and mythology, as well as activities like hunting, weaving, and combat rarely preserved in the archaeo- logical record. During the past 20 years we have developed a major photographic archive of Moche art at the University of California, Los Angeles, which serves as an important resource for the study of their culture. Our goal has been to reconstruct aspects of Moche culture by com- bining systematic studies of their art with archaeologi- cal fieldwork in Peru. Our analyses of sites, including residential compounds, palaces, temples, and cemeter- ies, and the artifacts associated with them have allowed us to document archaeologically some of the complex scenes illustrated in Moche art, and to understand as- pects of their culture that are not portrayed in the art. During the past ten years our research has focused on the Jequetepeque Valley, located in the northern portion of the territory occupied by the Moche. In this region we have undertaken several lines of research, concentrating our efforts on the relationship between Moche ceremonial activities and socioeconomic organi- zation. In June 1991, UCLA began excavations at San José de Moro, a major ceremonial center in the lower Jequetepeque Valley. It was clear from its various ce- ramic styles that the site had a long history of occupa- tion and thus would be ideal for answering questions about the cultural sequence of the region. Moreover, the quantity and variation in monumental construction at the site strongly suggested that it had served as a major ceremonial center through most of its occupa- tion and thus could provide us with good insights about the nature of Moche ceremonial activity. During our first field season we excavated three complex late Moche tombs - each consisting of a room- sized burial chamber made of mud bricks. The tomb chambers had originally been roofed with large wooden beams. The principal occupant of each tomb was lying face up in an extended position, with the remains of complete llamas, humans, or both, at their feet. In two of the tombs the principal occupants were flanked by other individuals. Hundreds of ceramic vessels and metal objects, including ceremonial knives, lance points, sandals, cups, masks, and jewelry, had been placed in the tombs as offerings. The most elaborate of the three tombs was that of a high-status adult female. It is the richest Moche fe- male burial ever scientifically excavated and clearly demonstrates that in Moche society extraordinary wealth and power were not the exclusive domain of males. The tomb chamber was approximately 772 by 14 feet.

The Moche Sacrifice Ceremony The Sacrifice Ceremony, an event at which prisoners of war are sacrificed and their blood ritually consumed, is a common iconographie theme in Moche art. One of the better known representations of this ceremony appears on a stirrup spout bottle. The scene, center, shows four principal figures and attendants. Below them are bound captives having their throats slashed. During recent excavations at San José de Moro and at Sipán the remains of several people who participated in this ceremony have been identified. Figure C, a priestess, was discovered at San José de Moro while Figure A, a warrior-priest, and Figure B, a bird-warrior, were excavated at Sipán. /. / X X 5 40 A R c: H A 1. () I.

Additional ceramic vessels had been stacked on the floor of the tomb chamber. Some of the artifacts associated with this burial pro- vide clear evidence that the Moche were involved in long-distance trade and that their elite expended a great deal of effort to obtain precious materials. In- cluded among the offerings were three imported ce- ramic vessels - a plate of Cajamarca style, which must have been brought to San José de Moro from the high- land area located more than 70 miles to the east, and two exotic ceramic bottles of Nieveria style, a type of pottery that was made in the area of Lima, more than 350 miles to the south. Two other kinds of materials as- sociated with the tomb provide further evidence of long-distance trade. Over the woman's chest and hands were Spondylus princeps shells that had been brought from Ecuador to the north, and around her neck were cylindrical beads of lapis lazuli that had been brought from Chile to the south. The most remarkable aspect of this woman's tomb, however, was that the objects buried with her allow us to identify her as a specific priestess who is depicted in Moche art. This priestess was first identified in the Moche Archive at UCLA in 1975, at which time she was given the name "Figure C." Five years later, Anne Marie Hocquenghem and Patricia Lyon convincingly demonstrated that this individual was female. She was one of the principal participants in the "Sacrifice Cere- mony," an event depicted in Moche art where prisoners of war were sacrificed and their blood ritually con- sumed in tall ceremonial goblets. Figure C is always depicted with her hair in wrapped braids that hang across her chest, and wearing a long dress-like garment. Also characteristic of Figure C is her headdress, which is unique in having two promi- nent tassels. The tomb of the woman at San José de Moro contained an identical headdress with two huge tassels made of a silver copper alloy. In one corner of the tomb was a large blackware ce- ramic basin containing cups and a tall goblet. An iden- tical blackware basin with cups in it is shown associated with Figure C in a famous mural at the site of Paña- marca, a ceremonial center located in the Nepeña Val- ley. Furthermore, the tall goblet contained in the ceramic basin was of the type used in the Sacrifice Cer- emony. It is decorated with a scene of anthropomor- phized clubs and shields drinking blood from similar goblets. The tall goblet is a prominent feature in all de- pictions of the Sacrifice Ceremony, and it is often seen being presented by Figure C. Finding the tall goblet in her grave thus supports her identification as Figure C. The tomb of Figure C at San José de Moro has profound implications for Moche studies. Excavations by Walter Alva at Sipán, located in a valley to the north of San José de Moro, have revealed the tombs of two other participants, Figure A and Figure B, in the Sacrifice Ceremony. The richest of these tombs is that of the Lord of Sipán, Figure A. He was buried with his characteristic crescent-shaped headdress, crescent- shaped nose ornament, large circular ear ornaments, and warrior's backflap, and was holding a rattle like that shown in representations of Figure A. The occu- pant of another tomb appears to be Figure B, a bird warrior who is frequently shown as companion to Fig- ure A. He was found wearing a headdress adorned with an owl. Although no grave of Figure C has yet been ex- cavated at Sipán, it seems likely that someone who per- formed this role was also buried at that site. How do the tombs at Sipán relate to the tomb of Fig- ure C at San José de Moro? First, it should be noted that the two tombs at Sipán date to approximately A.D. 300, and those at San José de Moro at least 250 years later - sometime after A.D. 550. Clearly, the Sacrifice Ceremony had a long duration in Moche culture, with individuals consistently dressing in traditional gar- ments and headdresses to perform the roles of specific members of the priesthood. The Sacrifice Ceremony was also widespread geo- graphically. The Pañamarca mural, which clearly de- picts this ceremony, was found in the Nepeña Valley, in the southern part of the Moche kingdom. San José de Moro is more than 150 miles to the north of Paña- marca, and Sipán is another 40 miles further north. Moreover, in the 1960s rich tombs containing artifacts with Sacrifice Ceremony iconography were looted from the site of Loma Negra in the Piura Valley, more than 300 miles north of Pañamarca. The four sites where evidence of the Sacrifice Cere- mony has been found have certain characteristics in common. Each is located on an elevated area that rises naturally above the intensively cultivated valley floor and is near, but not immediately adjacent to, a river. Each was a major ceremonial complex, with multiple pyramids that for centuries served as staging areas for religious activities. Perhaps each of the other river val- leys that made up the Moche Kingdom also had a cen- tral ceremonial precinct where the Sacrifice Ceremony was enacted. The fact that the Sacrifice Ceremony was so wide- spread in both time and space strongly implies that it was part of a state religion, with a priesthood in each part of the kingdom comprised of individuals who dressed in prescribed ritual attire. When members of the priesthood died, they were buried at the temple where the Sacrifice Ceremony took place, wearing their ceremonial paraphernalia and accompanied by the objects they had used to perform the ritual. Subse- quently, other men and women were chosen to replace them, to dress like them, and to perform the same cer- emonial role. The careful excavation of the tomb of Figure C at San José de Moro has provided important new insights into the näture of Moche religious practices. As our ex- cavations continue at this remarkable site, we expect to find additional archaeological evidence that will refine and improve upon these insights. ■ 42 Archaeology</page></plain_text>
