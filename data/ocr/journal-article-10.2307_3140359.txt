The high expectations cherished in respect to the visit to the University of Chicago during the Summer Quarter of Principal A. M. Fairbairn of Mans- field College, Oxford, have been quite satisfied. For six lectures in two con- secutive weeks nearly the whole University-- students of theology, science, language and history alike-gathered to hear the latest word on what probably alone would have called together so mixed an assembly- religion. An old theme to be sure, and yet so rapid and successful has been the recent application to the old theme of the new method-the inductive and historical -that probably nine-tenths of the audience heard things as new to them as they were interesting and vital. One thing certainly the students must have learned, namely, that, though they had never yet visited it, there existed a whole continent of thought, named by the terms history, science and philosophy of religion, that this continent was being progressively explored, and that even the latest word spoken on it might prove not to be the last. The lecturer stands so eminent in his specialty, and faced some of its chief problems so squarely that those interested in progressive thought will expect some indication of the chief positions taken. After an introductory lecture on the scope of philosophy of religion, and a second one on the philosophic basis of the same, in which latter theistic spiritualism was advocated, the subject proper was treated in substance as follows : Archaeology and ethnology can never show more than the origin of religions, i. e., of the specific qualities of religions, while to philosophy must be reserved the problem of the origin of religion (singular), as generic to the human race. Quite similarly the origin of languages must be investigated by comparative philology, while that of language belongs to philosophy. " He who fancies imitation the basis of speech simply shows philosophic incompetence. No sound becomes speech until a mind stands behind it." Ethnology has done good service in proving-contra the superficial observations of such travelers as Sir R. Burton and Sir S. Baker-that all peoples possess a religion. Empiricism, on the other hand, errs when it seeks to trace the rise of religion in man previously uninformed by religious ideas. Renan says more truly that religion sprang up because man was man. When Mr. H. Spencer, the last of the great empiricists, brings together religious data without distinction of space and time, as he invariably does, he lies open to the charge of ignor- ing his own cardinal doctrine that environment counts for as much as organ- 213</page><page sequence="2">214 THE BIBLICAL WORLD. ism. Nor can Mr. Spencer be allowed his thesis that the modern savage represents primitive man, until he bring those savages into historical connec- tion with present civilized man. Indeed this lack of space and time relations sharply distinguishes anthropology from history. The former is merely graphical and individual, the latter nothing less than biological and organic. This Mr. A. Lang himself regrets. The successions in religious stages are therefore only imaginary, and can constitute no philosophy. No one has yet discovered a savage passing to a civilized faith. Not those at the source, but those near the mouth of the Nile are significant for human culture; not the Esquimaux, but the Greeks tell the story of man. Study of the philosophy of religion arose about the end of the fifteenth century. The causes that led to it were: (I) The expansion of man's knowledge of the world, which raised the question of the relation of heathen to God; (2) The Reformation, which detached God from church polity, so that Zwingli could say that he expected to meet sages like Socrates in the future life; (3) The Renascence which showed that the Greek possessed really noble thoughts. Cudworth was among the first to occupy this comprehensive viewpoint. Per contra A. Ross of Aberdeen berated Mohammed as an incar- nation of the devil, an opinion which Voltaire approached, while Gibbon's epigram construed the famous dictum, "There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is his prophet," as combining an eternal truth and a necessary falsehood. Similarly Bishop Butler defamed nature when, to redeem revealed religion from its supposed injustice, he charged the same upon natural religion, thereby trying to make two blacks equal one white. A new and better "analogy " is needed and can now be supplied by our improved knowledge of n.:ture. Three salient phenomena of our subject are: (I) the universality of religion, (2) the permanence of religion, and (3) the multiplicity of religions. Note that permanence differs from immutability. Indeed the death of religions forms the condition of the life of religion. What Homer loved Plato outlawed, but not therefore did religion die in Greece. Men grow, religions must grow with them. Now the universality implies a common cause, while the multiplicity implies particular causes leading to varieties. Hence arise two chief problems: (I) What is the cause of religion ? and (2) What are the causes that tend to varieties in religion ? But first a definition of religion will be necessary. Among the definitions given by empiricists, Comte's is abstract and does not distinguish existing religions, Mr. Lubbock's definition involves two concepts which cancel each other, Mr. Spencer's "seraphic wisdom" and Mr. Lang's definition alike fail, and Mr. Tylor's amounts to nothing more than an expression of his own idea as to primitive animism. Among the philosophers, Kant, Schelling and Fichte reduced religion to morality, Fichte making God the moral order of the universe. Similar to</page><page sequence="3">COMPARA TIVE-RELIGION NOTES. 215 these views was Gautama's doctrine, and in recent times Mr. M. Arnold's "Power not ourselves that makes for righteousness." But the history of religion has recently made all such definitions useless by showing that religions were by no means always moral. Another set of philosophers make religion consist entirely of feeling. So the famous Schliermacher in reaction from the Kantian rationalism. But no feeling of dependence can arise without a thought of some one on whom man depends. In fact religion involves both thought and feeling and action. " Religion is therefore, subjectively, consciousness of relation to suprasensible being ; objectively, expression of that consciousness in custom, institution and action." Note that God receives no mention here, and that of purpose, since the object of religion ranges frorn the trifling fetish to the absolute God. Religion further implies belief in a similar relation of the suprasensible being to man, and thus revelation correlates with faith. Such revelation must not be considered restricted to religions recorded in a book. Besides defining religion we must define evolution. This is an old idea- both Eastern and Western, both Indian and Greek, whether under form of emanation or incubation. Hegel devised a development in logical process. "Darwin contributed minute observation of phenomena, setting in sensuous terms a great metaphysical idea." Now evolution is always only modal as distinguished from causal, and, therefore, can never really conflict with theism, which may always ask where is the arena, what the end, and who the cause. But Tyndall's famous phrase, "matter the promise and fotency of all life" would constitute evolution a causal fact. Per contra evolution has peculiar value for theism in that it directs attention to the end in order to learn the significance of the beginning and middle. The beginning is quite a different thing from the cause. The latter must be learned from inspection of the whole course, with increasing attention as progress prevails and most of all at the culmination. No doubt religion began, in part, as man in nature, but neither remains there. Both are fully explicable only through their end. Having defined religion and evolution, we are now prepa'red to consider the three factors in the evolution of religion, which are the material, the formal and the ideal. The material factor supplies the content or body of the religion, and consists of man; the formal factor supplies the particularform, and consists of nature; the ideal factor unifies and directs the other two, and is God. The three stand in organic unity. Man can live and think only by nature, and God acts on man through nature. More particularly as to the material factor it must be a primary cause, since it is to explain a universal fact, religion. It cannot be fear, or chance, or personifying tendency, priestly or kingly intrigue, or misinterpreted dreams, rather the material factor of religion arises as a necessity of man's nature. Hence those that reject one form of religion must devise another. Thus J. S. Mill took as a religious object his deceased wife, Schopenhauer took will, von</page><page sequence="4">216 THE BIBLICAL WORLD. Hartmann took the unconscious, Spinoza took substance, and Mr. Spencer takes force. The material factor is ever creative and progressively realized. Thus the moral-player's deity is far surpassed by God as conceived by Milton. The formal factor is the nature that surrounds man and the history behind him, and this it is that causes the variation in religions. Thus in the Rigveda names for the deities are derived from nature. Brahm grows into the gods, men and things. From this results pantheism and a lack of certain ideas, much to the surprise of Westerners, such as duty and individuality. Per contra the Semitic religions arose amid a desert nature where life could not well be conceived as immanent. Hence names for power and the emotions it evokes are used for the deities. This conception is transcendent and never allowed pantheism to arise as a native Semitic product. Averroes reached it only in touch with Aristotle, and the pantheism of Spinoza is akosmism- God alone, no world-whereas in Brahmanism the world is'God. A second component in the formal factor is nature as qualified by history. The more primitive man, the greater the influence of nature upon his concep- tion of deity; the longer his remembered past, the greater the influence of man upon that conception. Thus Vedic deities are conceived as simultaneous, each independent of the other, just as spheres of nature were supposed to be, while the Homeric deities were conceived as successive in accord with the Greek social fabric. Each of these viewpoints dominates everything else in the religion. Thus images in India are symbolic, in Greece anthropomor- phic, and, provided the &amp;vOpwros be good, such anthropomorphism can only benefit. Again, pantheism in India made future existence take place by metempsychosis, while in Greece, the more the deities were anthropomor- phized, the more continued personal being became conceivable. In Homer the shades are unhappy, with Socrates and Plato much improvement is made. The third element of the formal factor consists of society and the state. The Semitic social unit of the family with the patriarch supreme led to a conception of deity as absolute, and made theocracy native to the Semite. Per contra, Indian society was divided into castes with the priestly Brahmanic caste at their head. The hymns and sacrifices of these Brahmans were neces- sary to the success alike of warriors and workmen, and hence they and their Brahma with all the logical consequences of the same, have endured through the ages while conquerors have entered India and left it again. A fourth element in the formal factor is personality. This comes later in development and is very potent. In non-Semitic religions the personal element is rare, in Semitic common. India, the most religious of lands, has yet rarely presented a great religious person. Gautama Buddha is notable, but his power is explicable rather by later imaginings. Zoroaster and Con- fucius exhaust the list outside the Semitic race, while within it we find David, Moses, Isaiah, Paul and Mohammed. Christ stands in the same order. Here plainly a transcendent god favors transcendent personality. Pantheism leads to necessity and moral indifference. Transcendent religions afford freedom</page><page sequence="5">COMPARA TIVE-RELIGION NOTES. 217 for the god, though perhaps only necessity for man. Thus Islam presents a necessity of human will in subjection to the divine, but in Hinduism the necessity is inherent in matter. Ethical ideas can enter religion only through this transcendent element. Thus the ethics of Jesus the Christ and of Gautama the Buddha are kindred, because both center in a great personality. Finally, the constant relation of the material and formal factors implies a great will working throughout history. This ideal factor appears especially in the creation alike of the great persons and their environments. The process culminates in Jesus of Nazareth who combines the truth both of immanence and transcendence, in that equally as veritable man and veritable Godhe stepped forward to enlighten groping humanity. While criticism of these valuable lectures will not be attempted here and consequently no proofs advanced, a warning on two very general points may prove useful to those not conversant with the new science of comparative religion. First, the inductions made are based on data drawn from but four peoples, the Indians, Greeks, Hebrews, and Arabs. Other students of the science would require inclusion of the remaining peoples of these same Indo-Keltic and Semitic races, and of the peoples of the third great historic race, the Mon- gol, as also of the several savage races. Second, the rise of religions is traced wholly to naturism (nature-worship), whereas other students would require inclusion of the phenomena of animism (spirit worship). For a masterly statement of the respective merits of naturism and animism, and of the need to include all human phenomena among all peoples in the inductions of the science of religion, consult Saussaye's Lehrbuch der Relzgionsgeschichte.
