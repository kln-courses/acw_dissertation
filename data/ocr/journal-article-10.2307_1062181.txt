This slim volume attempts a major synthesis in Celtic mythology with a view to formulating a fundamental existential statement informing early Celtic religion. Iconographical evidence of the Gaulish goddess Epona in her anthropomorphic and hippomorphic guises is matched to the medieval Welsh tale of Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed, who is chosen as husband and thus legitimate lord of the land by Rhiannon, an otherworld goddess figure. The tales that revolve around the abduction and restoration of the royal pair's son Pryderi are reflexes of a cosmic hierogamy in which the gods, representing the male principle, are united with the world, the expression of the female principle. The continuance of this union assures human and animal fertility, good weather, prosperous harvests; its failure renders the kingdom barren, the wasteland of Continental Arthurian romance. The pursuit of these themes in medieval Irish literary tradition reveals the complex nature of the divine father, giving him a multiplicity of roles in Celtic narrative, at once progenitor, abductor, and restorer of the divine son. In the final resolution of the various narratives and the myth they articulate, Sterckx posits an absolute potentiality represented by a Varunian god incap- able of fecundating the mother goddess, the world. The potential of being is realized through the seduction of the goddess by a rival, Mitra-like divinity, and in the birth of the son, the life of the world. But the paternal pair assure periodic returns to nonbeing through the earthly cycle of life and death. Sterckx skillfully reviews a wide range of material, and the conclusions drawn, save perhaps the final synthesis, lie within the spectrum established by earlier scholars. The focus on a single cosmological mythologem, however, results in certain imbalances: listing 300 expressions of Epona in the plastic ?1987 by The University of Chicago.

More serious, perhaps, is insufficient recognition that, in the mass of Irish testimony to the relationship between the rulership and the land, between the king and sovereignty goddess, both human morality and the feminine divinity are active forces. The failure of a king to rule justly, more than any physical blemish or defeat, occasions the return of the divinity as goddess of death. Here the feminine principle plays a more determining role than in Sterckx's reductionist paradigm, while man is not simply condemned to reflect the inadequacies of divine prototypes. [WILLIAM SAYERS, Council of Ontario Universities] The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord: Samaritan and Jewish Concepts of Intermediation and the Origins of Gnosticism. By JARL E. FOSSUM. Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament, vol. 36. Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1985. Pp. 378. This is one of the most important books on Gnosticism to appear after the complete publication of the Nag Hammadi texts. The author searches for the origin of the Gnostic demiurge in the Samaritan (and Jewish) traditions, among which the sect of Dositheus, and especially its antinomian splinter groups, play a crucial role (pp. 45-75, esp. 64 ff.). A thorough investigation leads the author to establish a set of representa- tions that seem to derive, historically and logically, from one another, thus forming a continuous series that would eventually bring about the Gnostic demiurge as a lesser, mainly negative, creator of this world. According to Fossum, the whole process commences when the Word of God is transformed in a hypostasis: the Angel-Word (pp. 86 ff.). There is enough evidence, from (Hellenized) Judaism, Samaritanism, and from Simon the Magician of Samaria and his successors, whom the author proposes to call "protognostics," that the creation of the actual world is attributed to an angel of the Lord. This angel is by no means an evildoer (pp. 192 ff.). Even the "protognostics" would not consider him as such. They would only stress the fact that this angel, who is identified as being the God of the Jews, could not be God Himself (pp. 216 ff.). The idea that the same angel was also the creator (or, actually, one of the creators) of the human body was widespread "at a time when the borderlines between the various divisions within the wider phenomenon of Judaism were vague. While Gen. 1.26 could be taken to imply that the body of man was the production of (certain) angels, Gen. 2.7 lent itself to the view that Adam's body was produced by the principal angel, the Angel of YHWH" (p. 237). Several other sets of Samaritan beliefs, such as the magic power of the Name of God and the qualities bestowed upon prophets by the endowment with God's Name, are presented by the author as a sequel to the Word hypostasis. Simon would actively use these Samaritan traditions (pp. 112 ff.). The whole sequence would thus be: Word, Name, Angel of the Lord, being a hypostasis of both Word and Name. The prophet as "bearer of the Name" is a distinct 435</page></plain_text>
