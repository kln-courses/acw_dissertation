(SP-425) Air Conditioning and Heating Systems for Trucks. Kenneth Cuffe, General Motors Corp. This paper reviews the elements necessary to design and develop integrated air conditioning and heating systems for trucks. Included is discussion of the pertinent sub-systems: dash mounted air handling components, air distribution system, operator controls, refrigeration cir- cuit, electrical system and vacuum system. Also reviewed are the physiological factors involved in heating and air conditioning. 780002. A Study of the Effects of Manganese Fuel Additive on Automotive Emissions. Louis J. Faix, Chevrolet Div., General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. The effects of using the manganese fuel additive, MMT, on experimental engine emission control systems have been evaluated in a prototype vehicle test program. Two types of engines and catalytic converters were used in vehicle emission control systems designed for compliance with the .41 HC, 3.4 CO, and 2.0 NOx g/mi standard. Testing included multiple engine dynamometer and vehicle schedules which accrued the equivalent of nearly 2-1/2 million vehicle miles. The only major adverse effect of MMT fuel usage observed was a twofold increase in engine and tail pipe hydrocarbon emissions over the 50,000-mile vehicle test schedule durations employed. This increase was attributed to a build up of manganese oxide deposits in the engine combustion chambers. 780003. Effect of MMT on Emissions from Production Cars. D. L. Lenane, Ethyl Corporation Research Laboratories, Ferndale, Michigan. Ethyl has been conducting extensive emission studies of two car fleets to investigate any effect of MMT on exhaust emissions from production cars. One fleet is being operated by Ethyl for 50,000 miles on an EPA-type durability route. This fleet consists of thirty 1977 Cali- fornia cars - six cars each of five models (four U.S. and one import). Two of each model are using clear certi- fication fuel, with two each using the certification fuel plus 1/32 g Mn/gallon or 1/16 g Mn/gallon. Although the test is still running, the 16 U.S. cars using clear fuel or 1/16 g Mn/gallon have completed the 50,000 miles. For these cars, the average increase in HC, CO, and NOx emissions was essentially the same for both the clear-fuel cars and the MMT cars, with deterioration rates being somewhat lower for the MMT cars. The second test involves 20 cars from a large oil company fleet of 1975 and 1976 catalyst-equipped cars used by salesmen in the field. Ten of the cars have used clear fuel and ten have used fuel containing 1/8 g Mn/gallon, with average mileage exceeding 50,000 miles. Engine-out emission data were obtained before and after deposit removal, and tailpipe emissions were measured as received and after tune-up. The engine-out data show only little differences in stabilized emission levels between the clear-fuel cars and the MMT cars, both before and after deposit removal. As-received tailpipe emission data showed a larger spread in individual car ratings, probably because of missing air-pump belts on some cars and other malfunctions of the air delivery system. Average tailpipe emissions after tune-up showed only small differences between the clear-fuel and MMT cars, with the difference in hydrocarbon emissions resulting from the abnormally high HC emissions of one MMT car. 780004. How MMT Causes Plugging of Monolithic Converters. Robert L. Furey, Fuels and Lubri- cants Dept., General Motors Research Labs, Warren, MI; and Jack C. Summers, Physical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Labs, Warren, MI. Monolithic oxidation converters can become plugged with manganese oxide deposits when the gasoline contains the antiknock additive MMT. Engine dynamometer studies showed that the rate of converter plugging depended on the catalyst inlet temperature and the concentration of MMT in the fuel. Converter plugging was not affected by base fuel or engine oil composition, and it occurred as readily with a bare monolithic support containing no catalytic material as with a production catalyst. Monolith- ic converter plugging appears to be a physical, rather than a chemical phenomenon, in which the manganese oxide collects primarily on the inlet edge of the converter. 780005. MMT Plugging of Oxidation Catalysts on Ce- ramic and Metal Supports During Engine Dyno Studies of Catalyst Durability. Ivan E. Lichten- stein and Joseph P. Mundy, Matthey Bishop, Inc., Malvern, PA. During engine dyno durability testing of oxidation catalysts, manganese deposition on the catalyst hot faces sufficient to affect catalyst performance for HC and CO conversions was observed. The severity of the problem is related to the MMT level in the fuel, the cell density of the catalyst's monolithic support, and engine aging time. The nature of manganese deposition in these studies and how it affects catalyst performance is explored. Apart from the MMT phenomenon, comparative studies of oxidation catalysts on conventional ceramic and high cell density, thin-wall metallic supports indicate that the latter offer significantly improved HC conversion durability. 780006. The Fast Burn with Heavy EGR, New Approach for Low NOx and Improved Fuel Economy. H. Kuroda, Y. Nakajima, K. Sugihara,, Y. Takagi and S. Muranaka, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., (Y okosuka/Japan). In the way to seek a marked reduction of NOx just by EGR which was proved to be the best answer from the past studies, this analytical study deals with combustion around the practical engine stability limit. 19</page><page sequence="3">780007-780011 The results show that practical engine operating stability limit with the four cylinder engine is determined by the occurrence of several percent of slow burn. Experiments applying short combustion duration (fast burn) showed that the fast burn in combination with heavy EGR improves engine stability and has a potential to achieve substantial reduction in NOx emission along with some improvement in fuel economy. This potential was also directed by mathematical model study. This fast burn concept was embodied in the newly developed Nissan Z Fast Burn Engine. 1978 SA E Transactions 780007. Development of a New Combustion System (MCA-JET) in Gasoline Engine. Hirokazu Nakamura, Tsuneo Ohinouye, Kenji Hon, Yuhiko Kiyota, Tatsuro Nakagami, Katsuo Akishino and Yutaka Tsukamoto, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. A new combustion system - called MCA-JET - has been developed to improve combustion under the low speed, low load conditions typical of urban driving. Engines with this new system incorporate a special "jet valve", in addition to the inlet and exhaust valves of the conventional combustion chamber, which directs air or a super-lean mixture towards the spark plug, and induces a strong swirling flow in the cylinder. This swirl persists during the compression and expansion processes, moves the mixture spirally and helps the flame to propagate. As a result, the combustion of lean mixtures, including those with exhaust gas recirculation, can be carried out rapidly and thus the fuel economy improved. 1 978 SA E Transactions 780008. Emissions Performance of Lean Thermal Reac- tors - Effects of Volume, Configuration, and Heat Loss. Ronald J. Herrin, General Motors Re- search Lab. Effects of gas mean residence time and residence time distribution on the emissions performance of automotive thermal reactors were evaluated using a research reactor which provided independent control of volume, internal configuration, and heat loss. Steady-state tests of this reactor on a lean-mixture, multicylinder engine revealed that mean residence time significantly influences the performance of well-insulated reactors. However, high heat loss diminishes the residence time effect in uninsu- lated reactors. Adjusting reactor configuration to improve residence time distribution increases performance irre- spective of heat loss. Overall, insulated "2-pass" reactors are nearly optimum. 1978 SAE Transactions 780009. Using Computer Simulation to Evaluate and Improve Vehicle Handling. S. L. Chiang and D. S. Starr, Ford Motor Co. As evidenced by extensive research work done under contract to the government recently, it is clear that there is a strong federal interest in the limit handling performance of automobiles. Should these efforts come to fruition, manufacturers may be faced with the difficult task of designing vehicles to meet independent and, at times, conflicting handling requirements. Not only must vehicles continue to meet with subjective approval of handling behavior by customers, but they may also be required to meet objective limit performance criteria. Problems arise in that vehicles designed to achieve high levels of limit performance are not guaranteed to be more controllable or subjectively acceptable to customers. This paper shows ways design changes may cause conflicting influences on several measures of performance. The process of development necessary to arrive at vehicles which meet several requirements may be an expensive and time-consuming trial-and-error process unless correct vehicle parameters can be specified at the initial stages of design. This paper illustrates how a computer model, which can predict with accuracy the objective performance of vehicles in the limit handling tests, can, at the same time, give estimates of the subjective ratings these vehicles will receive. Through application of this program it is now possible to exper- iment with the multitude of design parameters influencing vehicle handling behavior and predict the effects on both subjective and objective performance. 780010. Correlation and Evaluation of Driver/Vehicle Directional Handling Data. David H. Weir and Richard J. DiMarco, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. Results of a study to analyze and correlate handling- related driver/vehicle system response and performance data are reported. Steering control tasks involving ma- neuvers and disturbance regulation are emphasized. Correlations between vehicle handling parameters, objec- tive measures, and subjective rating data have been made. These have led to the tentative definition of values of steering gain and effective yaw time constant which are preferred for satisfactory handling qualities and per- formance for passenger automobiles. 780011. Study of Vehicle Steering and Response Char- acteristics in Simulated and Actual Driving. Brian S. Repa, Alexander A. Alexandridis and Larry J. Howell, Engrg. Mechanics Dept., Gen- eral Motors Research Lab., Warren, MI; and Walter W. Wierwille, Virginia Polytechnic Insti- tute and State University, Blacksburg, VA. The effects of various combinations of vehicle steering torque gradient, control sensitivity, and lateral acceler- ation response time on driver-vehicle performance were investigated. Three subjects performed regulation tasks on two facilities (driving simulator and variable response vehicle) under identical disturbance inputs. The per- formance trends were essentially the same on both facilities, and significant interactions among the three vehicle characteristics were observed. 20</page><page sequence="4">780012-780020 780012. Effects of Trailer Hookup Practices on Passenger Car Handling and Braking. Richard Klein, Donald Johnston and Henry Szostak, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. This paper presents selected results from a full-scale test program aimed at development and validation of test procedures for evaluating car/trailer handling and brak- ing performance. The results described herein pertain to the observed effects of hitch load, load leveling (via weight distributing type hitches), and tow car tire inflation on modifying the tow vehicle understeer gradient and its sensitivity to lateral acceleration. Abrupt reductions in understeer were observed which increased the tendency for jackknife. Front/rear tire pressure differentials (front lower than rear) have a significant beneficial influence when the hitch load is high. Effects of these hookup variables on trailer swing mode stability and combination vehicle stopping distance are also presented. 1978 SA E Transactions 780014. COBALT Magnets for Automotive Accessory Motors. Robert W. Lee and John J. Croat, Physics Dept., General Motors Research Labs, Warren, MI. The best COBALT magnets are of SmCo5 type made by the powdered metallurgy-sintering process and provide energy products up to 160 kJ m3 (20 MGOe). Up to 90% of the samarium in SmCo5 can be replaced by more plentiful rare earths, to produce magnets with energy products approximately 70% that of SmCo5. This versatility allows motors to be optimized with respect to the availability of the various rare earths and the motor requirements. Bonded magnets are less brittle and can be machined but the magnetic properties and thermal stability are inferior to sintered magnets. Magnets can be laminated to powdered iron for improved toughness. COBALT mag- nets are available in small amounts from 22 magnet manufacturers and the starting material powders are produced by seven processors. 1978 SA E Transactions 780015. Permanent Magnets for Automotive Applications. Gerald T. Barta, Indiana General Magnet Products, Div. of Electronic Memories &amp; Mag- netics Corp. Permanent magnets are playing an increasing role in automotive applications. They are potential energy stor- age devices which can be effectively used in accessory motors, sensing systems and actuators, sometimes in combination with micro processors, to conserve energy, save weight, reduce pollution and to increase safety. This paper will discuss commercial magnet materials available and some of the many applications using these materials. 780016. Optimum Permanent Magnet Motor Design for Automotive Applications. Arthur J. Macoit, Elec- trical and Electronics Div., Ford Motor Co. The majority of permanent magnet motors used in today's automobile utilize ceramic magnets in a stereotype design that is a direct descendant of the wound field motor. Designers of these motors should not limit themselves to the self-made rules that dictate the use of high-coercivity, arc-shaped magnets in small airgap geometries. This paper will show that the motor designer can achieve the most optimum, cost effective design for each application only if he gives full consideration to all the ceramic magnet grades and configurations available and matches them to the needs of the application. 1978 SA E Transactions 780017. Generał Aviation Crash Survivability. Richard G. Snyder, Highway Safety Research Institute, Institute of Science and Technology, The Uni- versity of Michigan. Statistics indicate that during the past decade (1967-1976) the number of general aviation aircraft involved in an accident is equivalent to at least 38% of the total U.S. production during that period. Estimates that an aircraft will be involved in an accident over a 20 year life range are as high as 60-70%. Recognition of this probability has led to crashworthiness and occupant survivability "pack- aging" design concepts as offering the most realistic approach to reduction of serious and fatal injuries when an accident occurs. This paper reviews and illustrates current general aviation aircraft accident experience relative to occupant impact injury and damage indexes, and provides new data relative to current-generation aircraft. Results clearly indicate that when the cabin structure remains relatively intact, the occupant is ade- quately restrained in an energy-absorbing seat system, the interior structures are designed to distribute loads and absorb energy, and the impact forces imposed on the occupant are within human tolerances, the occupant can survive without serious injury even when the aircraft is destroyed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780020. NASA Technical Advances in Aircraft Occupant Safety. John H. Enders, Chief, Aviation Safety Technology Branch, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC. At the present time, NASA has three major research efforts in progress. The results generating from these efforts may be utilized by designers to improve occupant safety of aircraft. The three efforts are as follows: 1) Through reliable warning of imminent turbulence encounters, flight crew members will be able to alter flight level or route or prepare for turbulence transit by reducing airspeed and ensuring passenger restraint through the use of seat belts to prevent occupant injury; 2) In fire threat situations, efforts to prevent the outbreak of fire, to promptly detect and extinguish fires, or control the rate of fire development, should improve the likelihood of occupant survival and; 3) Improved efficiency of energy absorbing fuselage 21</page><page sequence="5">780021 - 780030 structure, and seat and occupant restraint system designs should greatly improve the likelihood of surviving crash impact trauma. 780021. Occupant Safety in the Space Shuttle. Norman R. Schulze and Reuben P. Prichard, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC. The space shuttle reduces operational space costs and makes space accessible to more personnel. Mission objectives dictate how occupant safety is achieved. High standards of occupant safety in a space vehicle's haz- ardous environment, in turn, greatly influence design. Protection from some hazards, like fire, explosion, depressurization, toxicity, control loss, and radiation are controlled similarly to past space programs but with some deviations from aircraft practices. Man is another hazard source which is controlled primarily by training and proper procedures. 780022. Crash Safety for Railroad Passengers, Train Crews and Grade Crossing Crash Victims. Henry H. Wakeland, National Transportation Safety Board. Crashworthiness observations over ten years of accident investigations in major railroad accidents are reviewed and significant factors and recommendable factors pointed out. Although rail fatalities are far fewer than highway fatalities, improvements have fewer limitations and railroads have a long term future, making for efficient effort. Problems are in railroad passenger cars, design of locomotive and caboose. Certain accidents could pose catastrophic failures of crashworthiness. Rail rapid transit and crash protection for vehicle occupants at grade crossings are ahead. Automotive engineers are challenged by nine design problems. 780023. Occupant Protection in Boating - Collisions and Other Accidents. C. Christian Stiehl, Wyle Lab., Huntsville, AL. The important elements of occupant protection in boating are discussed with respect to the variety of accident types in boating. Several structural and hardware solutions to occupant injury hazards are presented. The need for further research in the areas of collision protection and crash survivability in boating is identified and empha- sized. 780027. Emissions from Catalyst Cars Beyond 50 000 Miles and the Implications for the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program. Michael P. Walsh and Barry D. Nussbaum, U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency. High mileage vehicles (in excess of 50,000 miles) con- tribute more than half of all vehicular emissions. With the new catalytic converter equipped cars, the proportional contribution of these vehicles may be even higher than for pre-catalyst vehicles. Thus a substantial portion of motor vehicle related air pollution may be caused by vehicles not subject to the manufacturer directed provisions of the Clean Air Act. This paper presents a modeling effort based on hypotheses and some preliminary data, and suggests some alternatives to combat this potential problem. 780028. Impact of Diagnostic Inspection on Automotive Fuel Economy and Emissions. Ted Bay 1er and Leslie Eder, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Washington, DC. Rarely does one have enough fuel economy sample cars to test for a high statistical confidence in the conclusions. The diagnostic inspection demonstration projects suppor- ted by NHTSA provided just such an opportunity. Project data on fuel consumption collected from participants under actual day-to-day driving conditions showed a 4.7 percent improvement in fuel economy after repair to correct emissions. If this could be projected nationwide, it would mean saving about 1.8 billion gallons of gasoline per year, and a subsequent savings of $1.1 billion per year for the consumer. In a concurrent study with EPA, samples of compact and intermediate cars were tested for emissions and fuel economy. Minimum repairs were made to meet inspection criteria, with an average repair cost of $16. Of these cars, 65 percent required no parts. This data indicates that periodic diagnostic emission inspection and maintenance of rejected cars can be administered at low cost, reduces pollution levels of HC and CO, and significantly improves fuel economy. Analysis of the emissions data show an overall average reduction of 22 percent for hydrocarbons and 12 percent for carbon monoxide. The vehicle failure rate for emis- sions decreased from 23 percent to 10 percent over a one year period. 780029. Diagnostic Equipment Development for Military Vehicle Applications. Donald S. Sarna and Joseph W. Steyaert, U.S. Army Tank-Automo- tive Research and Development Command. Simplified Test Equipment for Internal Combustion Engine Powered Materiel (STE/ICE) is being developed by the US Army with emphasis on test capability and ease of use. This paper discusses the man/equipment interface as well as the test capabilities of STE/ICE. Emphasis is placed on the unique test capabilities available and a concept for defining a built-in interface for the Army vehicle fleet. The focus is on the Tank- Automotive area but the applications extend to all internal combustion engine powered equipment. 1978 SA E Transactions 780030. Repair Industry Response to Diagnostic Inspec- tion Projects. Wendell A. Cook, National High- way Traffic Safety Administration. The widespread consumer problem of faulty and unnec- essary motor vehicle repairs led to the establishment of five demonstration projects to examine the costs and 22</page><page sequence="6">780031 -780035 benefits of performing diagnosis separate from repair. Project sites were located at Huntsville, Alabama; Phoe- nix and Tucson, Arizona; Washington, D.C.; Bayamon, Ponce, and San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Chattanooga, Tennessee. A total of 92,819 periodic inspections and 32,734 reinspections (after repair) were performed. This paper summarizes the repair industry response to the projects in terms of adequacy, cost, and necessity of vehicle and subsystem repairs performed. The relation- ships to diagnostic information provided, duration of project operation, project location, and type of facility performing the repairs are also discussed. 780031. Official Inspection Procedures for Road Vehicles in Great Britain. C. C. Toyne, Vehicle Inspection Div., Dept. of Transport (London). The various systems of inspecting the condition of road vehicles in Great Britain are presented. Firstly, the system of public service vehicle inspection is described, together with the results of these inspections. Secondly, the system of using authorised commercial garages to inspect pas- senger cars, motorcycles and light vehicles is covered. Representative figures of the results of these tests are given. Thirdly, the inspection of heavier goods vehicles and trailers is dealt with and a detailed description is given of the system used for the inspection of these vehicles at Government owned and operated testing stations. The paper, therefore, deals with the following three types of inspection systems: - (i) Inspection at the roadside and at operators' premises by Department of Transport examiners. (ii) Inspection by commercial garages supervised by Department of Transport examiners. (iii) Inspection at Government owned testing stations conducted by Department of Transport examiners. 780032. How Passenger Car Maintenance Affects Fuel Economy and Emissions, A Nationwide Survey. D. L. Walker, J. O. Boord, J. S. Pigott and E. R. Sutton, Champion Spark Plug Company. Beginning in May of 1975, Champion Spark Plug Company embarked upon an extensive nationwide pro- gram to gather data that would determine how passenger car engine conditions relate to fuel consumption and emissions. This program, by use of a diagnostic check lane and a mobile chassis dynamometer laboratory, was to be the most comprehensive look at motorist maintenance habits and their effect on fuel consumption and emissions ever undertaken by a nongovernmental source. Five thousand six hundred and sixty-six passenger cars were ignition and emission diagnosed and from these, 216 cars were selected for the "before and after" dynamometer test based on their need for a tune-up. This test gave a realistic view of how the average motorist, having a periodic tune-up performed on his vehicle, can help save fuel for himself and the nation; and at the same time improve the quality of the air he breathes. 780033. A Technique for the Diagnosis of Malfunctions in Diesel Injection Systems. Naeim A. Henein, Wayne State Univ.; and James D. Rozanski, U.S. Army TARADCOM. Many diagnostic parameters have been studied for the detection of malfunctions in two types of diesel injection systems: the unit injector and the distributor pump system. It has been found that the peak fuel pressure in the unit injector pressure chamber (measured by a strain gage mounted on the injector rocker arm), and the peak fuel pressure in the line near the injector on the distributor injection system are very useful parameters for fault diagnosis. Figures and charts relating the fuel peak pressure and engine speed have been developed to identify a healthy as well as a faulty injection system. 780034. Auto Club of Missouri Diagnostic Clinic. L. A. Pipes, The Automobile Club of Missouri. A total system approach toward mass automotive diag- nosis that has been successful for ten years is presented. Paper reviews what are considered as the reasons for success in St. Louis, highlights unique test methods developed, covers some equipment modifications, and such other important ingredients as: personnel admin- istration/training, facility layout, testing sequences, ar- chitectural problems inherent in dynamometer usage, cost controls, equipment improvements, and inspired man- agement. Another unique feature of the system is the post-repair reinspection offered to users for one dollar, and feedback data on repair quality is also presented. This medium through-put facility performs approximately 12,000 inspections annually. 780035. Economic Comparison of Future Automotive Power Systems. G. Mauri, G. P. Fetterman, Jr. and R. L. Ricci, Exxon Enterprises Inc. This paper presents Exxon Enterprises Inc.'s approach to the economic evaluation of advanced automotive power systems. The paper derives and compares projected initial costs and operating costs for a subcompact car and a full size car powered by four different advanced power systems, i.e. an advanced spark ignition engine, a lightweight diesel engine, a battery powered motor, and a diesel electric hybrid system. The operating economics are based on a detailed analysis of the power system energy consumption. A proprietary computer program was used to simulate vehicle operation on a specific driving cycle and thus provide suitable energy consumption estimates. The initial and operating costs of the vehicles also reflect the different size and weight of the power systems, as well as weight propagation effects on the rest of the vehicle. For a meaningful comparison basis, each vehicle power system is sized to achieve an equivalent performance level (carrying capacity, acceleration capability, etc.), to the extent possible with motive components of vastly different characteristics. 23</page><page sequence="7">780036 - 780044 780036. Light Duty Automotive Fuel Economy....Trends through 1978. J. D. Murrell, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This is an analysis of fuel economy data compiled by the U.S. EPA on passenger cars from model years 1958-1978, and light-duty trucks from 1975-1978. The paper includes new fuel economy data on pre- 1975 cars, which indicates that fleet average MPG for the older models is slightly higher than had been previously estimated. Analysis of 1977-78 passenger cars and light trucks' economy characteristics in terms of the new EPA/DOE "Vehicle Size" classes provides new insight into fleet MPG characteristics as related to model changes. The methodology for isolating fleet and individual manufacturer fuel economy changes due to specific factors such as system optimization and weight mix shifts has been refined, and is applied for the first time to trucks and to comparison of 49-states and California vehicles. The vehicle fleet which is the basis of the analysis includes the top-selling 18 car makers and 8 truck manufacturers. 780037. A Comparison of Fuel Economy Results from EPA Tests and Actual In-Use Experience, 1974- 1977 Model Year Cars. Barry McNutt and Diane Pirkey, U.S. Dept. of Energy; Robert Dulla and Craig Miller, Energy and Environmental Anal- ysis, Inc. In response to growing concern over the validity of the EPA fuel economy numbers, the Department of Energy undertook a study of actual on-road fuel economy as it compares to the EPA numbers. This report covers the development of the data base for that study, the analysis techniques used for the initial phases of the work, and the preliminary results of that analysis. Data on over 5000 in-use vehicles were collected for model years 1974-1977. Data were obtained from a number of private and government groups for vehicles in fleet and typical consumer use, from on-road tests, and from in-use dynamometer tests. Comparisons using linear regressions were made between these mpg values and the EPA certification results for the same models. The results describe these differences as a function of vehicle mpg and model year. Other more specific com- parisons are also made. An analysis of in-use fuel economy ranking, compared to the ranking by the EPA mpg numbers, is presented. 780039. Closed Loop Control for Adaptive Lean Limit Operation. Michael D. Leshner, James W. Stuart, Jr. and Ervin Leshner, Fuel Injection Development Corp. Although an engine's lean limit fuel-air ratio may be easily found experimentally, it is difficult to predict accurately due to the influence of speed, load, ambient conditions, ignition characteristics, fuel chemistry, engine wear, etc. This paper will describe a new closed loop feedback control which adaptively tracks the engine's instantaneous lean limit using only one engine sensor. Test data is presented which indicates the control system response to changes in ignition timing, fuel chemistry, speed, and load. Results from laboratory and field tests indicate a significant improvement over programmed fuel-air sched- uling systems, both in fuel economy and exhaust emis- sions. Discussion: P. H.

Pietrowski, Dominion Foundries and Steel, Ltd. (Canada). A study has been made of the influence of press forming and corrosion under cars on the fatigue properties of sheet steels. Press forming was done in the laboratory and corresponded to types of deformation occurring in production. Samples from laboratory and undervehicle corrosion environments were tested. Forming was found to improve fatigue properties and corrosion to cause a deterioration. The drop in fatigue strength caused by corrosion was similar for all types of steel examined, and no worse than that caused by moderate notches that are commonly encountered in service. 1978 SAE Transactions 780042. The Effect of Galvanizing on the Fatigue Char- acteristics of an HSLA Steel. T. R. Risbeck, Republic Steel Corp. This paper examines the effect of hot dip galvanizing on the fatigue resistance of SAE 950X HSLA steels. Tensile and constant amplitude strain-controlled fatigue data for 0.123 in. gage galvanized steel are compared to data from three uncoated SAE 950X steels. Additionally, results of testing galvanized and uncoated 0.103 in. gage MAXI- FORM® 50 (SAE 950X) steel from a split coil are compared. Galvanizing produced essentially no changes in tensile or fatigue properties except in the extreme low-cycle fatigue regime where galvanizing caused a reduction in the fatigue ductility coefficient, cf'. 780044. The Future of Digitally Tuned Automotive Radios. R. L. Summerville and D. G. Ballentine, Ford Motor Co. The use of electronic digital tuning in automobile radios offers many advantages. These include radios of reduced size and weight which are becoming all important considerations in the design of all automotive compo- nents. In addition, the reduced size allows considerable freedom for interior stylists. At the same time, electron- ically tuned radios offer superior performance at reduced cost. This paper demonstrates the probability that in the near future nearly all automobile radios will be digitally tuned. It provides a direct comparison between presently available radios and all-electronic radios. 24</page><page sequence="8">780045 - 780052 780045. Signal Seeking, Digital Display, Clock Radio/Tape with Electronic Tuner. R. W. Shimanek, Delco Electronics, Div. of GMC. Electronic tuning and frequency synthesis techniques have made possible the combination of an eight-track tape player, digital clock and AM/FM/Stereo/Signal-Seeking automobile radio in a 2700 cm3 package. Phase-locked- loop circuitry, varactor tuning, and calculator logic replace the conventional mechanical tuner and provide all its functions. In addition to reducing receiver weight, this tuning technique assures extreme tuning accuracy and frequency stability. 780046. Development of an Electronic Search Tune Radio. R.J.

Prewitt, Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the relative effects of transmitter power, antenna efficiency, and interference from local and distant stations on the communicating range of a mobile CB station. Performance comparisons between several popular antenna types and curves of signal strength versus distance are included. 780048. A Unique Approach to Mobile CB. R. B. Harris, Ford Motor Co.; and J. E. Andrews, Motorola Inc. A new 40-channel CB Radio System has been developed by a major automotive manufacturer as a regular production option for a number of its 1978 cars and trucks. To maximize theft resistance, the system uses a remote chassis, detachable microphone, and a tri-band antenna. The factory-installed CB features a uniquely styled power microphone, digital channel display, au- tomatic scan, switchable noise blanker, memory for emergency channel 9, automatic noise limiter, and extensive vehicle noise suppression. Vehicle speaker(s) are time-shared with the entertainment systems. This state- of-the-art system is presented here in terms of component functions, design development, manufacture, and test equipment and procedures. 780049. An Effective Automotive Antenna Test Range. Ivars Renga, Chrysler Corporation. The antenna test engineer, by defining his basic needs and utilizing relatively uncomplicated measurement tech- niques, can easily define the performance of most vehicle antenna designs. Employing basic "off-the-shelf" in- struments and an uncomplicated test site approach, the cost of the test range can be minimized while retaining maximum versatility. Due to the phenomenal growth and interest in Citizens Band (CB), measurement techniques for CB will be emphasized along with AM and FM bands. 780050.

Passive attitude control systems compensate for suspension height changes due to static load variations but leave a problem of excessive body motion in response to lateral and longitudinal acceleration. In this paper a system of active ride is described which retains the advantages of a soft suspension, yet controls body pitch and roll due to braking and cornering forces. Handling quality is en- hanced by precise control of front to rear roll stiffness. Computed and experimental data is presented to establish fulfilment of the design objectives. 780051. A Dry Air, Electronic-Controlled Leveling Sys- tem for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks. Jerry W. Burns, Delco Products Div., GMC. This paper describes a new leveling system which addresses itself to the needs of future, lighter weight vehicles for which attitude control is more important and engine vacuum is partly or totally unavailable. The system utilizes reverse air flow to clean its filter and regenerate its air dryer for lifetime moisture control. The electronic controller and high capacity compressor provide positive response without the use of a storage tank. The reduced number of air fittings and an improved "snap-on" fitting help guard against leaks. This system is described as it interfaces with passenger cars and light trucks using air-adjustable springs in the suspension system. 1978 SAE Transactions 780052. Self-Energizing Hydropneumatic Levelling Sys- tems. Theo Meller, Research and Development Dept., BOGE G.m.b.H. (Eitorf/Germany). New hydropneumatic levelling systems with single and twin chambers are presented for application in almost all vehicle makes and types. They are self-energizing and convert the relative movement between axle and body to the advantage of height adjustment. The internal pump work must be understood as load dependent damping, optimizing the settings in relation to load-dependent gas spring rates. It is shown that the units can be designed for similar body frequency within a wide range of payloads. This essay will assist in solving the problems of soft 25</page><page sequence="9">780053 - 780062 vehicle suspensions with large load differences. 780053. Reliability, Maintainability, Safety and Human Factor (RMSH) Considerations in the Automo- tive Industry. H. J. Bajaría, Rockwell Interna- tional. The automotive industry is constantly faced with the challenge of satisfying consumer desires on one hand and complying with government regulations on the other hand. These requirements, when reduced to design parameters, require many design trade-offs. This paper presents a package of new design engineering ideas which can adequately meet this challenge and require very few design trade-offs. The paper begins by pointing out that the reliability, maintainability, safety, and human factor (RMSH) con- siderations in design stages are the basis for meeting this challenge. Then five essential elements of the RMSH considerations in design process are discussed. 780058. Future Transit Bus Designs. Charles J. Daniels, Urban Mass Transportation Administration; H. Judson Holcombe and James A. Mateyka, Transportation Consulting Div., Booz, Allen and Hamilton Inc. This paper describes recent trends in transit bus design in the United States and Western Europe. It discusses the basic legal, regulatory, and operational constraints that historically have guided the design of full-size transit buses. It specifically addresses the implications of the constraint that fare payment must occur on-board the transit bus and be monitored by the driver. Future bus design concepts are presented which demonstrate the improvements that would be possible in service charac- teristics if this constraint were removed. The material presented is based in part upon research conducted for the Urban Mass Transportation Administration on the im- pact of fare collection on transit bus design. 1978 SA E Transactions 780059. Gas Turbine Application in Transit Vehicles. Richard A. Tarkir and Hartford H. Buckel, Booz, Allen and Hamilton Inc. During the engineering and public demonstration testing phases of the Transbus Program, the three prototype coaches equipped with gas turbine powerplants exhibited some advantageous operational characteristics that war- ranted further investigation. Consequently, Booz, Allen Applied Research investigated the gas turbine engine as a potential power source for transit coaches. An in-depth survey was conducted of gas turbine engine manufac- turers, whose products may be suitable for transit coaches, to determine their merits as compared to those of the diesel engine. Only Detroit Diesel Allison Division (DDAD) has a product sufficiently developed to warrant serious consideration of volume production. This inves- tigation indicates that while current engines are not economically justifiable, the gas turbine engine may be potentially superior to the diesel. 1978 SA E Transactions 780060. Three Dimensional Velocity Measurements by Laser Anemometry in a Diesel Engine Cylinder Under Steady State Inlet Flow Conditions. G. Wigley, Mechanical Engrg. Dept., Imperial College (London/England); and M. G. Hawkins, Perkins Engines (Peterborough/Eng- land). Three dimensional velocity measurements of the in- cylinder aerodynamics in the steady air-flow rig for two different Diesel cylinder heads were obtained by laser anemometry. Complex recirculating flows with high mean velocity gradients were found while the fluctuating component of velocity was relatively constant. Vector addition of two components in turn allowed rapid comparison to be made of the air-flow character- istics between cylinder heads and comparison with earlier hot wire and vane anemometer measurements. The directed port cylinder head was found to produce two main vortices whereas a cast helical port produced a flow which approached simple solid body rotation. 1978 SA E Transactions 780061. Velocity Measurements In Motored Engines - Experience and Prognosis. P. Hutchinson, AERE Harwell (Oxfordshire/England); A. Morse and J. H. Whitelaw, Mechanical Engi- neering Dept., Imperial College (London/Eng- land). Measured values of velocity and associated turbulence properties have been obtained in a motored single- cylinder Diesel engine and in a plexiglass simulation engine. The quality of the signals obtained from the real engine and the corresponding useful data rate are quantified and discussed. As a consequence, it is shown that measurements in real engines are likely to relate to crank-angle intervals of the order of 10 degrees. The implications of this conclusion are quantified by analysis and by measurements in the plexiglass engine. The results, from the motored Diesel engine, also show that values of velocity cannot be measured throughout the cylinder cavity. It is argued that best advantage can be obtained from laser-Doppler anemometry by conducting a small number of measurements in a real engine; demonstrating that these correspond closely to cor- responding measurements in a plexiglass engine with the same geometrical arrangement; and using the plexiglass engine to determine the influence of important parameters such as piston-crown shape, head shape, valve arrange- ments etc. 780062. Non-Contact Inspection in the Automotive In- dustry Today. John P. Corrunker, Jr., Trans- mission &amp; Chassis Div., Ford Motor Co. Non-contact inspection of highly specialized manufac- 26</page><page sequence="10">780063-780071 tured parts is no longer a philosophical topic of discussion with automotive engineers, but an absolute must for development of our product's survival. Device and form of non-contact inspection systems has reached out of the research and development labo- ratories as diversified in approach as the application required of it by the inventive human mind. Challenges presented by the uniqueness of the indi- vidual inspection problem, and the systems available to solve that problem, are the two most prominent consid- erations facing today's quality engineers and manufac- turing process engineers in the automotive industry. 780063. A Data Recording System of the Path of a Test Vehicle by Laser Beam and Some Applications to Steering Handling Test. Hideo Sakai, Japan Automobile Research Inst., Inc. (Japan). Contact and collision accidents of automobiles are spatial, and measurements of the path and its dispersion of the automobile and evaluation of operating performance from these measurements are important. There is residual path measuring equipment but there is a demand for more modern equipment. The author has developed equipment to automatically measure the position of an automobile by triangulation using laser beams and to process the data using a computer. This article will explain this equipment and give the results of some experiments in which this equipment was used to test automobile control as application examples. 1978 SA E Transactions 780064. The Design and Development of a Highway Speed Road Profilometer. Ronald J. Chaka, General Motors Corporation. This paper discusses the development of the Road Profilometer which is a Chevrolet 20 Series Van instru- mented with transducers and data acquisition equipment to measure and record the magnitudes of frequencies present in road surfaces. The information collected provides data for vehicle structural and suspension system development. The transducers include two non-contac- ting, vertical displacement transducers mounted on each side of the vehicle and two vertically orientated accel- erometers placed directly above the displacement trans- ducers. The vertical displacement optical transducers utilize lasers for illuminating the road surface. Vehicle speed and distance data is accumulated from a non- contacting optical transducer employing an optical cor- relation technique. Data acquisition, digitizing and en- coding, and recording of data on a digital tape recorder is controlled by a microcomputer. 1978 SA E Transactions 780065. The Rebuilding of an Aerial Lift and Body with Financial Considerations. David B. Seymour, Asplundh Tree Expert Co.

Terry L. Godier, McCabe-Powers Body Co. Some truck equipment manufacturers now offer a "Major Overhaul Program" to the users of digger derrick trucks. This program involves a complete tear down of the existing equipment and body; the rebuilding and remounting of the unit on a new truck chassis. This is followed by complete testing and finish work. The results produce a digger derrick truck in mint condition, under warranty, at a considerable savings when compared to a new unit. 780068. Adiabatic Turbocompound Engine Performance Prediction. R. Kamo, Cummins Engine Co.; and W. Bryzik, US Army, TARADCOM. The contemporary turbocharged aftercooled diesel engine is providing the world with one of the most efficient and dependable powerplants known to mankind. An adiabatic turbocompound diesel engine is analyzed in this paper to demonstrate that the contemporary diesel cycle without a cooling system could be the beginning of a new era in continued diesel engine efficiency, reliability and dura- bility. The problems with the diesel cooling system encountered in service are presented. The consequence of an adiabatic turbocompound engine without any cooling system is treated for engine performance. 1978 SA E Transactions 780069. Designing Adiabatic Engine Components. John H. Stang, Cummins Engine Company, Inc., Columbus, IN. A procedure to analyze and design adiabatic diesel engine components is developed. The analytical basis for the procedure is presented. An experimental study of related thermal boundary conditions in the combustion chamber is conducted. Mean effective gas temperatures as high as 2200° F are measured. A new adiabatic diesel piston, using a ceramic top, is designed and demonstrated using the procedure. Initial engine testing of the piston is encour- aging, with full design power being achieved. The piston is considered the critical component in the overall devel- opment of an adiabatic diesel engine. 1978 SA E Transactions 780071.

Making Aerospace Technology Work for the Automotive Industry - Introduction. Walter T. Olson, NASA, Lewis Research Center, Cleve- land, OH. The paper introduces a session that reviews some NASA-derived technology that may be useful in the automotive industry. Several examples in the paper illustrate aerospace technology already at work in that industry. Services offered by NASA to facilitate access to its technology are described. 780073. Improving Fatigue Life for Truck Axles - A Specimen Case of Using NASA Technology. Graham W. Markes II, Donald Maul and Gopal Singh, Engrg. &amp; Research Center, Eaton Corp.; and William Hoenes, Axle Div., Eaton Corp. This paper describes a method for determining the effect of proposed geometric, material property, or manufac- turing process changes on component fatigue life. The method integrates the application of field load data acquisition, analytical stress analyses, cyclic material properties, and strain based fatigue concepts. Fatigue life is then used as a major design change acceptability criterion. One of the key steps in this qualification process is the use of NASTRAN, a finite element stress analysis program developed by NASA. 780074. The NASA NASTRAN Structural Analysis Com- puter Program - New Content. Deene J. Weidman, NASA, Langley Research Center. This paper describes the development and content of the NASA-developed structural analysis computer program called NASTRAN. This program is in extensive use in the automotive industry as well as the aerospace and heli- copter industries, and has become a standard of reference among finite element programs. 780075. An Overview of Aerospace Gas Turbine Tech- nology of Relevance to the Development of the Automotive Gas Turbine Engine. D. G. Evans and T. J. Miller, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. The NASA-Lewis Research Center (LeRC) has con- ducted, and has sponsored with industry and universities, extensive research into many of the technology areas related to gas turbine propulsion systems. This aerospace- related technology has been developed at both the component and systems level, and may have significant potential for application to the automotive gas turbine engine. This paper summarizes this technology and lists the associated references. The technology areas included are: system steady-state and transient performance pre- diction techniques, compressor and turbine design and performance prediction programs and effects of geometry, combustor technology and advanced concepts, and ceramic coatings and materials technology. 1978 SA E Transactions 780076.

Results of selected NASA research programs on rolling- element and fluid-film bearings, gears, and elastohydro- dynamic lubrication are reported. Advances in rolling- element bearing material technology, which have resulted in a significant improvement in fatigue life, and which make possible new applications for rolling bearings, are discussed. Research on whirl-resistant, fluid-film bearings, suitable for very high-speed applications, is discussed. An improved method for predicting gear pitting life is reported. An improved formula for calculating the thickness of elastohydrodynamic films (the existence of which help to define the operating regime of concentrated contact mechanisms such as bearings, gears, and cams) is described. 1978 SA E Transactions 780078. The Design and Development of the Upper- Pivoted Sonic Carburetor. Charles F. Aquino, Electric Systems Dept. The two year design-development program for the sonic carburetor is reviewed. Use of the sonic nozzle as an air flow meter, and the design criteria to achieve low unchoke points is discussed. The relation between sonic flow and improved fuel atomization and A/F ratio distribution to the engine is also discussed. Unchoke data and A/F distribution data are presented, and the tradeoffs between low unchoke points and good A/F distribution are explained. Conclusions are drawn relative to the overall benefits of the sonic carburetor. 1978 SAE Transactions 780079. Knocking and Performance Characteristics of Low Octane Primary Reference Fuels Blended with Methanol. J. A. Gething and S. S. Lestz, Pennsylvania State Univ. Single cylinder SI engine tests were conducted with low octane primary reference fuel (PRF) blends and methanol. The investigated parameters were equivalence ratio, and PRF octane number ranging from 100 to 53 blended with weight percentages of methanol to 75 percent. In order to evaluate the performance of these different fuels, knock 28</page><page sequence="12">780080 - 780085 intensity, efficiency and emissions were considered. The results indicate that even a 53 octane number PRF blended with methanol displays some performance advantages over pure isooctane. This is best detected from the observed efficiency increase for all of the PRF blends except the 91 octane PRF blend. The improved efficiency is also higher than that of pure methanol. 780080. Four-Octane-Number Method for Predicting the Anti-Knock Behavior of Fuels and Engines. A. M. Douaud, Institut Français du Pétrole (France)., P. Eyzat. The "Four-Octane-Number Method" is a practical de- termination of the knock-resistance of fuels based on the autoignition delay concept and obtained through simple processing of the standard "Research" and "Motor" indices combined with two other indices specially defined. The knocking behavior of any engine can be specified once by measuring its octane requirement with 2 fuels for which the four octane numbers are known. The behavior of any fuel can be predicted without experimenting on all the engines thus identified if its four octane numbers are known. Extensive controls of the method have been performed over about 1000 samples for which the road octane numbers were measured. The method's predictions are within an average accuracy of 0.5 octane point. 1978 SA E Transactions 780081. Exhaust Emission Capabilities of Showroom Cars. A. C. Gullon, Environment Canada. This paper presents a statistical analysis of emission test results from over 200 light duty production vehicles ('72 to '77 models) which were purchased, maintained (in a very good state of tune), driven (on Appendix "IV" routes), and tested by the Canadian government. The results are presented as fractions of the applicable emission standard by manufacturer and by model year. Some limited data on urban fuel economy is also presented. The results would be useful in analyzing engine design policy and to assist in policy making for emission control programs for in-use vehicles. 780082. An Evaluation of Restorative Maintenance on Exhaust Emissions from In-Use Automobiles. John T. White III, U.S. Environmental Protec- tion Agency. This paper describes the results of an automobile exhaust emission testing program conducted by the U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. A total of 381 vehicles were subjected to a series of tests before and after various stages of tune-up. The vehicles were low-mileage 1975, 1976, 1977 models of the three major domestic manu- facturers and were obtained from private owners. Signif- icant findings include the confirmation of the poor emission performance of newer vehicles when compared to their standards, the wide extent of maladjustments and disablements and the large emission reductions possible upon correction of these problems. 780083. Soak Time Effects on Car Emissions and Fuel Economy. Robert L. Srubar and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and Martin E. Reineman, U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency. Five light-duty vehicles were used to investigate HC, CO, and NOx emissions and fuel economy sensitivity to changes in the length of soak period preceding the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). Emis- sion tests were conducted following soak periods 10 minutes to 36 hours in length. Each of the first 8 minutes of the driving cycle was studied separately to observe vehicle warm-up. Several engine and fuel system tem- peratures were monitored during soak and run periods and example trends are illustrated. The extent to which emission rates and fuel consumption are affected by soak period length is discussed. 780084. Effect of Cold Weather on Motor Vehicle Emis- sions and Fuel Economy. Nicolas Ostrouchov, Mobile Sources Div., Fisheries and Environment Canada (Ottawa/Canada). The effect of soaking temperature on exhaust emissions has been studied using a variety of automobiles represent- ing three different emission control levels and testing them at ambients of 20°C down to -30°C(60°F to -22°F). It was found that emissions of the three gaseous pollutants demonstrated a mild power relationship with ambient (soaking) temperatures. All regulated pollutants and fuel consumption were higher at -30°C than at 20°C: hydrocarbons (HC) - 3.5 to 9.2 times; carbon monoxide (CO) - 2.4 to 6.4 times; oxides of nitrogen (NOJ - only 1.1 to 1.4 times; and fuel consumption 1.2 to 1.8 times higher. Analysis of the data has indicated that HC and CO emissions from the cold start phase of the Federal test were the most sensitive to soaking temperature. With NOx emissions the soaking temperature sensitivity was fairly constant throughout the three phases of the Federal test. The data also indicate that the temperature sensitivity of both fuel economy and, to a lesser extent, emissions is a function of inertia weight. 780085. Overview of Electric Vehicles in the United States. Vincent J. Esposito, U.S. Dept. of Energy. This paper comprises a review of the scope and objectives of the Department of Energy's Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program. Current status is outlined as of February 1978 for the demonstration and technology development efforts, including both vehicle and battery developments. Performance specifications are noted for the first 200-400 vehicle demonstration in 1978 and for the near- term Department of Energy integrated electric vehicle devel- opment. Although competitive success of electric and hybrid vehicles is questionable for the next decade, eventual commercial acceptance of such vehicles as a 29</page><page sequence="13">780087 - 780097 major petroleum conservation tool is predicted. 780087. Electric Vehicles in Germany - Present and Fu- ture. C. Bader and W. Stephan, Deutsche Automobilgesellschaft Forschungslaboratorium (Germany). As long as economic considerations keep electric trans- port vehicles in the limelight of interest, the arguments raised in favor of the electric vehicle in general will prove unconvincing. In the drive system the separately excited shunt-wound D.C. motor is becoming widely acknowl- edged as traction motor; current developments deal with the replacement of electric power control units by mechanical components. Hybrid drive units are mainly employed in buses; so far no uniform solution has evolved. List prices of electric transport vehicles reveal the financial burden caused by energy storage units and their maintenance. 780088. U. K. Electric Vehicle Development Programmes. Jon M. G. Samuel, Advanced Vehicle Systems Ltd. (United Kingdom). Two aspects of electric vehicle development in the UK are discussed; vehicle chassis, hardware and battery devel- opment and operational experience. Electric delivery vans of the one to two ton payload range in the Lucas and Chloride programmes are discussed. The improving prospects for molten sodium sulphur battery in large vans and buses are examined. The GLC 'London Goes Electric' scheme for placing up to 62 vehicles in service in Central London is covered in addition to the Electricity Council trial of 60 Enfield city cars. 780090. Consumer Acceptance of Down-Sized Automo- biles. Patricia L. Braden, Graduate School of Business Administration, Univ. of Michigan. The average fuel-economy standards enacted under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act have stimulated domestic manufacturers to down-size new passenger vehicles. The strategies employed by manufacturers to maintain their competitive positions and the correspond- ing consumer response to down-sized vehicles are result- ing in visible shifts in the marketplace. The disappearance of traditional size-class distinctions are discussed in the framework of the theory of consumer behavior and corporate marketing strategy. Preliminary input to con- sumer acceptance of down-sized cars underlines the need for advances in engineering and design to maintain an effective range of choice for the consumer. 780093. SAE - The Information Source for Automotive Technology. Raymond A. Morris, Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. For over 70 years SAE has provided a continuous forum for engineers to present their theories and findings in the form of technical papers. These papers provide the basis for the largest single collection of literature on automotive technology in existence. The problems of utilizing this vast "storehouse" of information are discussed as well as methods for keeping up-to-date with the current infor- mation explosion. 780094. ETC. - Engineering Technology Communicated. Nancy F. Hardy, Engineering Index, Inc. Modern technology has now provided the engineering profession with a fast and effective means of commu- nicating engineering technology. Machine-readable ver- sions of traditional and new printed information sources and powerful software packages now enable engineers and others to retrieve information quickly, effectively and with a minimum of effort. In addition, access to multiple interdisciplinary data bases within minutes can satisfy several aspects of an engineer's question with a relatively small investment of time and money. Information sources in the online interactive mode now include machine- readable numeric data bases or so-called electronic handbooks, where actual data can be found. 780995. On-Line Technology - The New Way to Find Engineering Information. Carlos A. Cuadra, System Development Corp. Scientists, engineers, information specialists, and other professionals are using on-line retrieval systems to locate information rapidly and precisely in large data bases of literature citations and abstracts. Many data bases are available for such searching, including one covering SAE publications. On-line searches can be carried out in minutes, with greater precision and lower cost than manual searches of equivalent quality. Most on-line searching is done by librarians and technical information specialists, but many chemists, engineers, and other professionals do their own searching. For some data bases, including SAE, users can order copies of the original documents, directly from the terminal. 780096. How the Engineer Can Best Use His Library. Robert W. Gibson, Jr. and Barbara K. Kunkel, Library Dept., General Motors Research Lab., Warren, MI.

Literature searching techniques and library resources, including library staff aid, card catalog utilization, use of indexes and abstracts, online information retrieval, and alerting services, are discussed. 780097. Toyota Four-Speed Automatic Transmission with Overdrive. Akio Numazawa, Sei toku Kubo and Yoshio Shindo, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Shuzo Moro to, Aisin Warner, Ltd. (Japan). A new four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive has been developed and put into production for the purpose of the improvement of fuel economy and the reduction of engine noise. The transmission has the following characteristics: 30</page><page sequence="14">780098-780104 Gear train arrangement having overdrive unit between the torque converter and the three-speed auxiliary trans- mission High overdrive gear ratio Shift feel controls for clutch-to-clutch shifting Optimum shift points between third and overdrive gears on fuel economy, driveability and exhaust emissions Lockout system of overdrive gear This paper describes the design features and confir- mation testings considered to assure the reliability and durability of the transmission.

(Birmingham/England); Volker Schüler, Lohr &amp; Bromkamp GmbH Offenbach, West Germany; and Pierre Guimbretiere, Glaenzer Spicer S.A. (Poissy/France). Various families of constant velocity joints have been developed and applied in mass production vehicles, to overcome limitations imposed by cardan joints in auto- motive drive line applications. The special requirements of front wheel, rear wheel and longitudinal drive lines, as well as the different construction principles are specified and analysed. Furthermore the individual characteristics and fea- tures of the main GKN fixed and plunging joints are described. Forecast vehicle design requirements are identified which led to the development of a new constant velocity joint family. 1978 SA E Transactions 780099. Two-Speed Axles for Light Trucks. D. E.

Mikel, Chrysler Corp. A torque converter lock-up clutch was introduced by Chrysler Corporation in a majority of its passenger cars in the 1978 model year. The lock-up clutch improves fuel economy by eliminating torque converter slip in direct gear above a predetermined speed. The clutch and its controls were designed to fit within the confines of thé existing transmission. The development of the clutch was primarily concerned with achieving adequate endurance life, good shift quality and isolation of torsional vibra- tions. 780101. Random Load Simulation in Laboratory Fatigue Testing. Jang Moo Lee, Seoul National Univ. (Seoul/Korea); and Kenneth G. McConnell, Dept. of Engrg. and Science Mechanics, Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA. This paper presents the theory and hardware to simulate non-loglinear spectra (the typical field case), including a unique method of eliminating low amplitude reversals so that any service load history of high cycle fatigue can be simulated in a laboratory fatigue test. The feasibility of the proposed quasi-stationary random process to simulate the three standard SAE load histories on a statistical basis is demonstrated on both the theoretical and experimental basis. 1978 SAE Transactions 780102. Cycle Counting Methods and the Development of Block Load Fatigue Programmes. E. M. Power, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., The Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland). The basis of block load fatigue testing is the cycle counting method used to produce the test programme. The poor correlation with random loading often found may be due to the traditional counting methods. The paper discusses the new and more physically realistic "rain flow" counting method and presents test results which show that it can be used to give a more accurate simulation of random load fatigue damage than three traditional counting methods. The techniques advocated are particularly applicable to industrial fatigue testing where simple digital comput- ing facilities are available. 780103. The Mechanisms of Fatigue-Improvement Fas- teners in High Quality Shear Loaded Joints. B. N. Leis and S. C. Ford, Batelle Columbus Lab., Columbus, OH. The mechanics whereby fatigue-improvement fasteners give rise to increased joint fatigue resistance is examined using the results of both analytical and experimental studies. The inferences of a brief review of the mecha- nisms of fatigue damage are used to demonstrate how each of the interference fit, cold work, and coupled cold work-interference fit systems improve fatigue resistance. Experimentally developed fatigue data for standard joint test configurations are then analyzed using the so-called critical location approach to fatigue life analysis. The results of this study are interpreted in the context of joint designs used in the automobile industry. 1978 SAE Transactions 780104. Three-Dimensional Stress Analysis of the SAE Keyhole Fatigue Specimen. S. Neal, Sundstrand Hydro-Transmission, Div. of Sundstrand Corp., Ames, IA; L. W. Zachary and C. P. Burger, 31</page><page sequence="15">780105 -780110 Dept. of Engrg. Science and Mechanics, Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA. The results of a three dimensional finite element analysis of the stresses near the notch of the SAE keyhole fatigue specimen are presented. They are compared to plane analyses of the same area and also to data obtained from a three dimensional photoelastic analysis. The state of stress in the keyhole specimen is neither plane stress nor plane strain. Conditions at the midplane of the notch root are more favorable for early crack initiation than either of the plane formulations. 1978 SAE Transactions 780105. A User's View of Fatigue Life Predictions. Ralph C. Leever, Electromechanical Analysis and Measurement Lab., Transportation Equipment Products Dept., General Electric Co. Recent advances in metal fatigue analysis are examined with a view toward the need to devise specific procedures for acquiring and processing strain or load histories in order to evaluate structures for in-service fatigue life. Emphasis is on location of waveform reversal points, omission of insignificant ranges, and on cycle identifi- cation. A damage and life calculation method is selected and used as an example around which to construct a complete procedure for prediction of crack initiation life from strain histories; alternatives are considered. A method of estimating the cyclic stress-strain curve is proposed. 1978 SAE Transactions 780106. Using Modal Techniques to Guide Acoustic Signature Analysis. Randall J. Allemang and William R. Shapton, Univ. of Cincinnati. The use of signature analysis to determine the accept- ability of parts in a production line quality control situation is highly desirable. Specifically, the use of acoustic signature analysis is attractive due to the relaxed constraints in terms of fixturing the part in preparation for analysis. This study discusses techniques presently being investigated which rely on knowledge of the modal coefficients to direct the area of investigation. 1978 SAE Transactions 780107. Determination of Extreme Structural Loads in Service. Matyas Matolcsy, (RIAI) (Budapest/ Hungary); and Narendra J. Sheth, Ford Motor Co. This paper discusses the use of Extreme Value Analysis Technique for determining vehicle extreme service loads in service. A statistical method is presented (1) to estimate long term most severe loads in service from short term measurements, and (2) to estimate the multiple circuit proving ground loads from a few measured circuits. A procedure is also discussed for determining the minimum required trip time for recording load data (short term) so that the data have a statistically valid base for long term projection. Actual strain/time histories were measured for several structural components in "service-run-like" en- vironment. Two thousand kilometers of run were recorded, the data were analyzed and the results pre- sented. A detailed theoretical discussion on the extreme value distribution function is given in the Appendix. 1978 SAE Transactions 780108.

The techniques used to characterize the chemical and physical nature of particulates in diesel exhaust emissions are reviewed. The emphasis is on understanding the broader aspects of the fundamental nature of not only diesel particulates, but particulate systems in general. Consideration is given to the special nature of particulates which make them significant pollutants and to the relative place of the diesel in the formation of man-made particles. The underlying combustion processes leading to carbon and sulfur based particulates are reviewed. The important variables in steps of the combustion processes which lead to particulate formation are considered, as well as major fuel and engine factors. Collection methods are examined with examples given from current diesel dilution techniques. Probes, sampling lines, and instrumentation are considered. Methods of physical and chemical characterization are presented and examples from the current and prior diesel work at Michigan Technological University and elsewhere are given. 1978 SAE Transactions 780109. Investigation of a Diesel Exhaust Aerosol. D. B. Kittelson, D. F. Dolan and J. A. Verrant, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. This paper describes a study of the exhaust aerosols produced by a single cylinder Onan diesel engine using a rapid dilution sampling system. Diluted exhaust aerosols were analyzed with an electrical aerosol analyzer (EAA) and a transmission electron microscope. Mass concen- trations of particulate matter were determined by gravi- metric filter analysis. Volume mean diameters observed with the EAA were about 0.1 /xm. Mass concentration measurements made with filters were in qualitative agreement with those calculated from the aerosol volume concentrations meas- ured with the EAA. 780110. Diesel Exhaust Aerosol Particle Size Distribu- tions - Comparison of Theory and Experiment. D. F. Dolan and D. B. Kittelson, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Minnesota, Min- neapolis, MN. Particle size distributions have been measured in the 32</page><page sequence="16">780111-780116 exhaust of a single cylinder Onan diesel engine using an electrical aerosol analyzer. These measurements give volume mean diameter for the exhaust particles of about 0.1 /xm. Other investigators have shown that the particles found in diesel exhaust consist of agglomerates of very small primary particles (about 0.025 /xm diameter) and may contain condensed hydrocarbons. A mathematical model has been constructed to determine the particle size distributions which will result from the growth of the primary particles by coagulation. The coagulation equation was solved numerically for an expanding stratified system. The model indicates that the inhomogeneity characteristic of stratified combustion can explain the rapid growth of the primary particles into the larger particles observed in diesel exhaust. 1978 SA E Transactions 780111. The Characterization of the Hydrocarbon and Sulfate Fractions of Diesel Particulate Matter. N. J. Khatri, John H. Johnson and David G. Leddy, Michigan Technological Univ. One of the more objectionable aspects of the use of diesel engines has been the emission of particulate matter. A literature review of combustion flames, theoretical cal- culations and dilution tunnel experiments have been performed to elucidate the chemical and physical proces- ses involved in the formation of diesel particulate matter. A comparative dilution tunnel study of diluted and undiluted total particulate data provided evidence sup- porting calculations that indicate hydrocarbon conden- sation should occur in the tunnel at low exhaust temper- atures. The sample collection system for the measurement of total particulate matter and soluble sulfate in particulate matter on the EPA 13 mode cycle is presented. A method to correct for hydrocarbon interferences in the EPA barium chloranilate method for the determination of sulfate in particulate matter is discussed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780112. Cooperative Study of Heavy Duty Diesel Emis- sion Measurement Methods. J. M. Perez, Cat- erpillar Tractor Co., W. C. Clemmens, Envi- ronmental Protection Agency; L. C. Broering, Cummins Engine Co. Inc.; and J. H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. A cooperative test program was conducted by the CRC-APRAC CAPI- 1-64 Composition of Diesel Exhaust Program Group to evaluate the technical aspects of a proposed EPA recommended Heavy Duty Diesel Emis- sion Measurement and Test Procedure. The proposed changes affected the sampling configurations and the types of instruments used. Six participants studied the effects of a number of variables on the proposed changes and evaluated some alternative systems that included both CHEMI and NDIR instruments. The tests were conducted at one site using a multicylinder engine operating on the 13-Mode Cycle. Equivalency of systems was demonstrated and the best performance was obtained with a special NDIR system. 1978 SA E Transactions 780113. Characteristics of the Perkins 'Squish Lip' Direct Injection Combustion System. I. D. Middlemiss, Perkins Engine Group Ltd. This paper describes the application of a novel combus- tion chamber of re-entrant form to a high speed direct injection diesel engine. A parametric study with the major dimensions of the chamber as variables shows the relationship between oxides of nitrogen, specific fuel consumption and smoke emission. Control of pollutants is demonstrated at retarded injection timings without sig- nificant deterioration in performance. The major factors affecting hydrocarbon emission are presented and the combustion system is shown to comply with the most stringent exhaust emission legislation yet proposed. 780114. Diesel Exhaust Odour of Small, High Speed, Direct Injection Engines. Colin Ingram, Leyland Vehicles Ltd. A liquid chromatographic analysis system, a replica of the Arthur D. Little system, is described. This system may be used to make exhaust measurements in an engineering environment provided care is taken in the preparation of the analytical materials. The system was used to investigate the odorant formation processes in a small, direct injection diesel engine. The major factors influencing odorant formation were found to be the amount of fuel dispersion during the ignition delay and the nozzle uncontrolled fuel volume. These principles were embodied in a low exhaust odour engine and its performance is contrasted with an alternative combustion system. 780115. Measurement of Polynuclear Aromatic Hydro- carbons in Diesel Exhaust Gases. B. A. Brickle- myer and R. S. Spindt, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co., Pittsburgh, PA. The development and evaluation of a sampling system and analytical technique for the measurement of PNA in diesel exhaust are described. The sampling system for steady state engine operation utilizes the dilution of exhaust gas with air, injection of 14c radioactive tracers and collection of the condensed particulates on a filter. An analytical procedure was developed which consists of extraction of the filter sample, separation of certain PNA by procedures including TLC and HPLC and measure- ment by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. BaP and BaA emissions were determined for one diesel engine at idle, half load and full load. 1978 SA E Transactions 780116. A Microprocessor-Controlled Automotive AM/FM Radio. Kaare Karstad, RCA Solid State Div., Somerville, NJ. The design of a microcomputer-controlled automotive 33</page><page sequence="17">780117-780127 AM/FM radio is discussed. The system features, and gives priority to, a clock display. However, the 3-1/2-digit LED display can also serve as a 4-year calendar, elapsed-time counter, or frequency channel, on request. The tuning process automatically activates the frequency display. Basic aspects of real-time clocks and frequency measurements in microcomputer systems are discussed, as is the ability of the COSMAC processor to permit a software-generated clock to be obtained with low cost and high accuracy. While the ignition switch turns the display on or off, the CPU and clock run continuously. The use of CMOS circuitry in the system keeps the power drain below 5 milliamperes and assures months of system operation, even when the vehicle (battery) is not used. 780117. Chrysler Microprocessor Spark Advance Control. John Lappington and LaVerne A. Caron, Chrys- ler Corp. Electronics suitable for engine control applications has steadily evolved from analog control systems to micro- processor based designs. The change in technology required in switching from analog to microprocessors has required sensor development, new analog to digital conversion techniques, and development of custom in- put/output circuits suitable for automotive applications. By proper design of the microcomputer system, an engine control unit can be developed that is cost effective compared to conventional analog circuit techniques while providing additional flexibility. The primary limitation of a digital approach is the long lead time required to change the ROM pattern. This lead time can be reduced by combining PROM and ROM in the same system. 780118. Microprocessor Engine Controller. T. W. Hart- ford, Bendix Electronics and Engine Control Systems Group, Troy, MI. This paper describes a microprocessor engine controller designed for onboard control of closed-loop fuel injection, spark advance, and exhaust-gas recirculation. Developed through the preproduction prototype stage, the controller utilizes software subroutines to accomplish such opera- tions as multiplication and interpolation. Ignition is controlled by means of time delays from relatively widely spaced crankshaft-position pulses. Emissions, driveability, fuel-economy, and hardware-cost comparisons are made between the microprocessor engine controller and a 1977 production analog electronic-fuel-injection controller with a mechanical-advance-controlled distributor. Directions for future development efforts are also described. 780119. A Practical Application of Microprocessors in the Automotive Environment. G. Cilibraise, Electri- cal and Electronics Div., Ford Motor Co. The development of Ford Motor Company's microproces- sor based electronic engine control has identified a number of fundamental issues and general observations regarding the application of microprocessors to the automotive environment in the areas of microprocessor selection, cost partitioning and design objectives. 780120. Single Chip Microcomputers in Automotive Sys- tems. Brian Knowles, Intel Microcomputer Components Div., Gene Hill, Intel Microcum- puter Components Div.; Chester Silvestri and Richard Rubinstein, Intel Microcomputer Com- ponents Div. Five conclusions are drawn and discussed concerning single chip microcomputer trends and their impact on automotive systems. The conclusions relate to: •high performance microcomputers •minimum cost microcomputers •special purpose microcomputers •decentralization of automotive systems •use of EPROM in production systems 780121. Managing Automotive Microprocessor Interfaces. David K. Long, National Semiconductor. The 1978 model year marks a turning point in the introduction of electronic controls in automobiles. Al- though most of the existing functions are performed with analog circuitry, microprocessors are beginning to come into their own. Their ability to respond to the challenge rests largely on communications. Establishment of stan- dards for timing, interconnection and protocol are a necessary but not sufficient condition for the orderly development of compatible support products employing different technologies. This paper discusses some tech- niques for avoiding communication bottlenecks and introduces the concept of semi-smart peripherals. Cited examples include spark control, A-D conversion and display control. 780123. Simplification of System Inputs and Outputs for MPU Control Units. John Marley, Integrated Circuits Div., Motorola Inc. Some methods are suggested for organizing simple automotive sensor and actuator elements to minimize wires and use the analytical capability of the program of instructions stored within the memory of the electronic controller to extract information or manipulate the actuators. An information exchange system between microcomputer control units is described which allows trading of information. In this way, no sensors need be duplicated and each microcomputer serves as a single concentrator which permits sending a large group of facts from one part of the vehicle to another using only a few wires. 780127. Evaluation of the Landing Vehicle Assault (LVA) Over-Land Performance. David A. Sloss, Jr. and Peter M. Brady, Jr., Stevens Institute of Tech- nology. Evaluation techniques have been developed to insure that the new U. S. Marine Corps Landing Vehicle Assault 34</page><page sequence="18">780130-780135 (LVA) (1) will have an over-land performance at least equal to the Landing Vehicle, Tracked, Personnel, Model 7 (LVTP-7) which it will replace. Operations over roads, trails, cross-country, obstacles and across inland water barriers are considered for a specified mission scenario. The Cone Index and the Bekker Systems can be used independently or sequentially to represent soil strengths. A wide variety of performance data is available through an output processor. This ranges from over-all speed- made-good for the entire scenario to motion resistance, sprocket loadings, speed, fuel consumption, etc., for each scenario segment. 780130. The Target Car Program for 1977. John W. McDonald, Louis J. Bintz and Maury Kramer, Engineering and Technical Service Div., Au- tomobile Club of Southern California. This paper is an incremental report of an on-going program of the Automotive Engineering Department of the Automobile Club of Southern California in which desirable significant characteristics of today's automobiles are identified. Subjective and objective testing of current model year vehicles is conducted and the vehicles tested are ranked against a "target". The results of the tests involving twenty-four vehicles are reported. 780131. Efficient Vehicle Packaging with Front-Wheel Drive. Peter Phillips, Renault Technical Center, Belleville, MI; Andre Daniel and Roger Rebiffe, Renault (France). The search for improved packaging efficiency and flexible arrangements of available space has led Renault to the use of front-wheel drive. This paper outlines the development of four front-wheel drive passenger cars at Renault and illustrates both similar and unique solutions adopted to achieve engineering and marketing objectives. To obtain truly optimized designs for different sizes and classes of vehicles, it is very difficult to use common body and chassis components on several distinct car lines. 780132. An Overall Design Approach to Improving Pas- senger Car Fuel Economy. Edward K. Hanson, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The critical challenge of improving fuel efficiency of new vehicles must be met if the world's finite petroleum supply is to be conserved for future generations. Automotive engineers will require new, more efficient design tech- niques to successfully meet the challenge. This paper presents the approach used in the design of GM's new 1978 intermediates as an example of how improved efficiency can be achieved. Factors affecting fuel con- sumption are outlined along with program goal setting. Areas of emphasis including weight reduction, powertrain optimization, and road load horsepower reductions are discussed as well as explanations of new engineering tools used. 1978 SA E Transactions 780133. Passenger Car Classification Using Interior Vol- ume - A 1978 Up-Date. Barry McNutt and Diane Pirkey, U.S. Dept. of Energy; and Robert Dulla, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. In November 1976, the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated rules covering the classification of auto- mobiles for the purpose of fuel economy labeling and the Gas Mileage Guide. Since that time a number of changes have been made in the classification system and the interior volume measurements on which that system is based. This paper reports on the reasons for those changes and their impact on the classification of model year 1978 vehicles. The paper also discusses various trends in vehicle design as measured by interior and exterior volume, weight and fuel economy. Trends in various design efficiency factors are examined for model years 1976-1978 and a data base is presented for future analysis. 780134. Fairmont/Zephyr - Engineered for Lightweight and Improved Fuel Economy. A. L. Gutherie, Ford Motor Co. The engineering objectives for the new Fairmont/Zephyr carlines include: •Improve fuel economy by integrating aerodynamics into vehicle styling, reducing vehicle weight, and im- proving powertrain efficiencies, at no sacrifice of per- formance. •Maximum package efficiency by providing maxi- mum passenger roominess within the car's compact exterior. •A comprehensive weight reduction program was initiated to improve fuel economy on the Fairmont/Zeph- yr carlines. New concepts in body and chassis design and selective usage of lightweight materials have resulted in a 245 lb. weight reduction versus 1977 Maverick. The car's structural strength, response, and durability has been verified by sophisticated computer techniques and exten- sive vehicle testing. It is believed that the Fairmont and Zephyr are the most significant cars to be introduced by Ford Motor Company in many years. To meet these objectives, it was necessary to design and develop a unitized body with maximum passenger roominess, new front and rear suspension, lighter and improved powertrain availability, and to determine application of lightweight materials. The design of these components and usage of lightweight materials to achieve reduced vehicle weight for improving fuel economy is discussed. 780135. Safety and Comfort - Factors in Volvo Occupant Compartment Packaging. Nils Bohlin, Anders Hallen, Svante Runberger and Arne AAsberg, AB Volvo (Gothenburg/Sweden). How and why Volvo arrived at the current Volvo-240 size is reported. Volvo's primary concern in the car-size debate has been related to the occupant, to his requirements for safe and comfortable transportation and to his human 35</page><page sequence="19">780136-780142 limitations. The basic philosophy of occupant packaging related to safety is given. Certain crashworthiness criteria in terms of vehicle deformation characteristics and Minimum Restraint Space are discussed. Comfort packaging criteria, particularly in view of seating and driver's work space are dealt with and so is the question of measuring seating comfort objectively. Summary findings from studies for confirming the validity of criteria presented are included. 780136. Evaluation of a New, Dual-Phase, Cold-Rolled Steel - Mechanical Properties, Aging Responses, and Weldability. T. E. Fine, R. V. Fostini, B. S. Levy and A. G. Preban, Inland Steel Co.; and R. Stevenson, General Motors Corp. Mechanical properties and welding characteristics of a commercial, dual-phase, low-carbon, cold-rolled steel are described. The new steel, HI-FORM 80d, exhibits a total elongation of about 24% as produced and develops a yield strength of about 625 MPa (91 ksi) in a formed and paint-baked part. Property uniformity is excellent and the weldability essentially equivalent to an AISI 1006 steel. In addition, the aging response of HI-FORM 80d is such that yield strengths near 550 MPa (80 ksi) can be achieved with strains of less than 2% and lower paint-bake temperatures than are currently in use. 780137. Evaluation of a New, Dual Phase, Cold Rolled Steel - Formability. William G. Brazier, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Research Labs, Warren, MI; and Robin Stevenson, Physics Dept., General Motors Research Labs, Warren, MI. Future automotive designs will increasingly require the substitution of reduced gage cold rolled high strength steel for the mild steel currently employed in order to meet vehicle weight reduction goals. The formability of HI- FORM 80d, a candidate cold rolled high strength steel was evaluated both by laboratory formability studies and by stamping trials of representative production parts. The parts chosen for the stamping trial were chosen to satisfy two criteria: that they were candidate parts for material substitution and that they encompassed the range of strain states found in automotive stampings. The results of this study indicate that, for its strength level, HI-FORM 80d exhibits good formability; the formability of HI-FORM 80d is similar to that of aluminum body panel material. 1978 SA E Transactions 780138. Wheel Weight Reduction with GM 980X Steel. M. S. Rashid, Metallurgy Dept., General Motors Research Lab., Warren, MI; and G. D. Lawrence, Product Engrg., Motor Wheel Corp., Lansing, MI. Automotive component weight can often be reduced by replacing plain carbon steel with thinner high strength steel. However, the poor formability of the latter steels has, in part, restricted their use. GM 980X has far better formability than conventional SAE 980X, high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels and can develop the strength of the SAE 980X steels in the formed part. This paper discusses the performance of GM 980X steel in various wheel rim and disc forming trials and in component fatigue tests conducted with the objective of meeting the established performance requirements of plain carbon steel wheels with lighter weight HSLA wheels. Results suggest that GM 980X can be a viable substitute for plain carbon steel in wheels with weight savings as high as 25%. 1978 SAE Transactions 780139. High Strength Steels in Production Automobiles. S. Dinda, D. K. Kelley and A. S. Kasper, Materials Engineering, Chrysler Corporation. More that 77 kg (170 lbs.) of high strength steels (70 parts) are used in the new Chrysler Omni and Horizon models. Nearly 50 percent of these high strength metals is dent resistant steel. Why these high strength steels are used and what components are in production, are reported in this paper. The production experiences with these materials for major components are discussed. The development and application of dent resistant steel for hood outer panels are also reported. The advantages of using these high strength materials are also discussed in this report. 1978 SAE Transactions 780140. Structural Performance of Aluminum Bumpers. M. L. Sharp, J. R. Jombock and B. S. Shabel, Aluminum Company of America. This paper presents the results of tests of one-piece face bars. It develops tentative guidelines for assessing the resistance of aluminum bumpers to local damage. Resistance to denting is shown to depend on the magnitude and location of the load applied, and the yield strength and thickness of the material. Cracking resistance is dependent on load applied, configuration of the bumper, location of load, tensile strength and thickness of the material. Deformation capacity of the material also appears to be of importance. 1978 SAE Transactions 780141. Forming High Strength Bumpers from Aluminum Sheet. L. C. Blayden and J. E. Parnell, Alu- minum Co. of America, Alcoa Lab., Alcoa Center, PA. Bumper facebars formed from high strength aluminum sheet provide the design engineer with a cost effective way to achieve styling flexibility with substantial weight savings. Several prototype programs have defined can- didate alloys, manufacturing sequences, and important part and tooling design guidelines for forming bumpers from aluminum sheet. The results of these programs are summarized. Four case histories are discussed. 780142. Field Testing of Aluminum Bumper Alloys - Two-Year Report. W. H. Ailor, Jr. and T. L. Wilkinson, Jr., Reynolds Metals Co., Richmond, 36</page><page sequence="20">780145-780150 VA. A comprehensive long-term test on bare, anodized, plated, and organic-coated aluminum bumper stock is underway at atmospheric test sites at Pompano Beach, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Richmond, Virginia; and Chicago, Illinois. Aluminum alloys exposed originally in 1975 included 7016, 7046, X7029, and two experimental compositions. New exposures in 1977 included alloys 7129, 7021, 6009 and 6010. Specimens are scheduled for removal after 1-, 2-, and 4-years - 2-year panels were retrieved and evaluated in 1977 from Florida and Phoenix. One-year results from Richmond and Chicago will be reported here. Full-size aluminum bumpers (with and without rub strips) having organic coatings, anodized coatings, and chrome-plated finishes were exposed also, along with chrome-plated steel. 780145. Variable Displacement by Engine Valve Control. B. Bates, J. M. Dosdall and D. H. Smith, Ford Motor Co. Intake and exhaust valve control has been combined with engine calibration control by an on-board computer to achieve a Variable Displacement Engine with improved BSFC during part throttle operation. The advent of the on-board computer, with its ability to provide integrated algorithms for the fast accurate flexible control of the entire powertrain, has allowed practical application of the valve disabler mechanism. The engine calibration basis and the displacement selection criteria are discussed, as are the fuel economy, emissions and behavior of a research vehicle on selected drive cycles (Metro, Highway and Steady State). Additionally, the impact upon vehicle driveability and other related subsystems (e.g., transmis- sion) is addressed. 780146. Valve Selector Hardware. Robert S. Mueller, Engrg. &amp; Research Center, Eaton Corp., South- field, MI; and Martin W. Uitvlugt, Engine Components Div., Eaton Corp., Battle Creek, MI. A mechanism has been developed which deactivates selected valves on a spark ignition engine. Greater fuel economy results from reduced throttling losses when using fewer cylinders under light load conditions. Several approaches were considered, with the releasable fulcrum proving to be the most effective concept. Subsequent engineering efforts refined the design to develop a simple bolt-on device which would meet specific performance requirements. 780147. Relationship between Local Air-Fuel Ratio and Combustion Character in Spark Ignition Engines. Tadashi Ayusawa, Takaaki Nemo to, Yoshiyuki Koo and Souk Hong Jo, Engine Research Div., Japan Automobile Research Institute, Inc. The authors developed a method to measure the air-fuel ratio at local points within the combustion chamber. The primary point is to obtain the pre-combustion air-fuel ratio of the mixture from the HC (vaporized fuel) and 02 concentrations. This procedure which consists of three parts, gas sampling, gas transport and gas analysis, renders it possible to perform direct quantitative HC analysis of samples. This method is carried out by either of two techniques: multi-cycle sampling (MCS) and single cycle sampling (SCS), and the average air-fuel ratio of many engine- cycles and the single engine-cycle were obtained respec- tively. 1978 SA E Transactions 780148. Spark Plug Pressure Transducers for Measuring Indicated Work. Lawrence W. Evers, Dept. of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Res. Center, Bartles- ville, OK. Spark plug pressure transducers were used in an exper- imental study to determine the suitability of such devices for measuring indicated work in internal combustion engines. Three piezoelectric transducers were studied to compare response of the spark plug unit with a reference device; the comparative data were obtained from a single-cylinder engine fitted with both a flush mounted pressure transducer and a spark plug pressure transducer. Signals from both transducers were recorded simulta- neously, combined with a volume function, and analyzed for output differences. The volume function used in the calculations of indicated work was generated about an angular reference point recorded with the pressure data. Typically, indicated work calculated from the spark plug pressure transducer was found to be from -3.2 to +7.6% of that calculated from the flush mounted pressure transducer. The sources of inaccuracy associated with the spark plug pressure transducer are discussed. 780149. A Multimode Vehicle Performance Instrument. James F. Mc Grew, General Motors Corp. The Acceleration Performance Instrument was developed to reduce the manpower and equipment required for vehicle performance testing. Using only a single person and test vehicle, data may be obtained in five operating modes. The instrument prints time-to-speed and time-to- distance information on paper tape during vehicle accel- eration and coastdown. Acceleration testing may utilize a standing or moving start at any speed up to 99 mph. Vehicle coastdown data may be obtained between any two speeds and is useful for determining aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. Special modes provide Federal consumer passing information without the use of addi- tional personnel or vehicles. The instrument requires the addition of a 5th wheel and an AC power inverter for operation. 780150. Automated Data Acquisition and Processing for Brake Testing. T. G. Lawson and F. J. Kateb, Girling Ltd. A new method which automates collection and processing 37</page><page sequence="21">780151-780156 of brake test data has been developed to replace the more traditional methods of using an observer or Ultra Violet recorder. This method improves accuracy and also substantially reduces cost and can be applied to vehicle or dynamometer testing. Improved versions of the instru- ment would allow investigation of transient conditions. 780151. A Microcomputer Based Data Acquisition System for Versatile Mobile Data Processing. Thomas J. Flis and Baird Wallace, Ford Motor Co. A Microcomputer Based Eight Channel Data Acquisition System has been developed for customer correlation and routine vehicle field testing applications. The eight channel system includes a self-contained signal condition- ing system designed for a variety of transducer types and data frequency requirements. Calibration, signal gain, and channel zero offset adjustments can be performed under software control. The microcomputer system is based on a Motorola M6800 microprocessor and a non-volatile core memory module. The paper describes the design, development, field performance, and data processing characteristics of the system and presents specific automotive applications and field test results. 780152. Alternator Energized Electric Towing Dynamom- eter. Trevor O. Jones, Howard D. Stewart and Donald E. Wilson, General Motors Proving Ground, Mesa, A Z. The national goals of more fuel efficient automobiles are being achieved in part by smaller and lighter vehicles resulting in demands for smaller and compatible in- strumentation. Previously designed towing dynamometers for regular-sized vehicles were unable to provide ade- quately low drawbar levels for small cars like the Chevette. The dynamometer trailer provides a control- lable retarding force on the passenger car to simulate hill climbing. This paper describes electrical and mechanical characteristics and operation of a dynamometer specif- ically designed for contemporary vehicles. An improved method is outlined for supplying con- trolled electrical power to eddy-current retarders used on the dynamometer. The improved system uses a 24 volt production alternator to supply controlled direct current to the eddy-current retarder. The current delivered to the eddy-current retarder is controlled by adjusting the alternator's field current. Rotational energy to turn the alternator is derived from forward motion of the dyna- mometer trailer. The improved system eliminates the need for the previously used gasoline-powered generator and silicon-controlled rectifier system. The improved method greatly reduces initial hardware cost, operating and maintenance cost, and noise level. 780153. Recent Advances in the Detection of Knock in S.I. Engines. V. Arrigoni, G. F. Calvi, B. Gaetani and F. Giavazzi, Snamprogetti - Petro- leum Products Labs (Milan/Italy); and G. F. Zanoni, Agip (Rome/Italy). Problem areas of general applicability in the field of detection of knock in commercial engines are discussed. These include (a) the expedients adopted to reduce the effect of noise on the sensibility of the measuring instrument, (b) the characteristics of the pass-band electronic filter employed in this type of instrumentation and possible distortion effects, (c) the type and mounting of the transducer employed, with emphasis on devices outside the combustion chamber, and (d) the interpre- tation of the phenomena as detected with the devices used and its relation to the energy released from knock and the danger of mechanical damage. 780154. A Knock Intensity Meter Based on Kinetic Criterion. Carlo Vincenzo Ferraro, Machines Institute-Polytechnic of Turin (Italy). A new knock intensity meter, based on a criterion which correlates knock intensity and kinetic energy associated to knock-typical pressure oscillations, is described. Operating principles, electronic chain, as well as the method that led to an instrument capable of accurate measurements (both on laboratory engines and on automotive engines at high speed) are analysed. 780155. Reduction of Octane Requirement by Knock Sensor Spark Retard System. B. J. Kraus, P. E. Godici and W. H. King, Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Company. A 1975 California model automobile with an 8:1 C.R. 350 CID engine was modified by increasing the compression ratio to 9: 1 which resulted in improved fuel economy. The higher NOx emissions were reduced to the base level by substituting a back pressure-controlled EGR unit for the original valve and increasing the EGR flow. Octane requirement was controlled by a knock sensor-actuated spark timing retard system. The knock sensor (accel- erometer) is attached to one of the cylinder heads of the engine. When knock occurs, the vibration is picked up by the sensor, the signal is filtered to remove some of the engine background noise, and the knock pulse is detected. When the amplitude of the detected knock signal exceeds a threshold, the spark timing is retarded. When no knocking is detected over a waiting period, the timing is advanced back to its normal schedule. Using this system, the vehicle's octane requirement can be lowered several numbers with some performance debit, i.e., slower acceleration times. 1978 SA E Transactions 780156. Applicability of Safety Standards to Electric and Hybrid- Vehicles. Thomas F. MacLaughlin, Na- tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Dept. of Transportation. A study was conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to determine the applicability of Federal motor vehicle safety standards to electric and hybrid vehicles. Addressed in the study were vehicles to be 38</page><page sequence="22">780157-780163 included in the demonstration fleets called for in Public Law 94-413 and vehicles anticipated for future consumer use. Descriptions are given of existing and future electric and hybrid vehicles, and results of safety tests are reported. It was concluded that Federal safety standards, with few exceptions, should be applicable to electric and hybrid vehicles, with the possible exception of special purpose, limited performance and use vehicles. 1978 SA E Transactions 780157. Crashworthiness Tests on Two Electric Vehicles. Bert Enserink, Dynamic Science, Inc., James R. Hackney, OVSR, R&amp;D, NHTSA; and Thomas F. MacLaughlin, OCW, MVP, NHTSA. Crashworthiness aspects of two electric vehicles were evaluated in a modest test program. One vehicle was subjected to low-speed pendulum and barrier tests and static rollover. A second vehicle was subjected to a dynamic rollover using the procedure specified in FMVSS 208. Potential safety problems were exposed, and are addressed in the paper. 780158. A Projection of the Effects of Electric Vehicles on Highway Accident Statistics. James O' Day, Lily Huang and Howard M. Bunch, Highway Safety Research Institute, Univ. of Michigan. This paper was prepared in connection with a broader study of the opportunities and risks associated with a demonstration program defined by the Congress of the United States in the Electric and Hybrid Research, Development and Demonstration Act of 1976. The paper develops estimates of the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities which might result from introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles into the general passenger vehicle fleet. In order to derive such an estimate, we have referred to existing accident data banks for small internal com- bustion engine cars operating primarily in urban areas, and have extrapolated from that data to some assumed electric vehicle populations. In addition, we have con- sidered some particular problems of electric vehicles which might produce new dangers, such as electric shock, battery acid, and low acceleration capability. The desir- ability of imposing existing or new safety standards on these vehicles is considered. It is concluded that most of the current motor vehicle safety standards would have to be modified or waived in part in order for electric vehicles to satisfy the letter of the law. The preliminary analysis presented here indicates that selected waiving of safety regulations would not significantly increase the probability of serious injury and death in urban applications. Further, it is concluded that the process of developing such regulations at this time specifically for the electric and hybrid vehicles could substantially delay production and increase costs of the vehicles. 780160. General Safety Considerations of the Ohio DOT Electric Vehicle. Warren C. Harhay, Electric Vehicle Associates, Inc. Two conventional gasoline powered four passenger coupes were converted to electric drive for use in the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) motor pool. Compliance to applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety and anticipated Department of Energy Standards were desired goals. The implications for fire and shock hazards as well as dynamics compliance were considerations in the scope of effort. Techniques used and results of prelim- inary tests are reported. It was concluded that conversion of conventional vehicles to electric drive can be under- taken to achieve safety parity. 780161. Computer Simulation of the GM Unit Injector. R. S. Scullen and R. J. Hames, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Future improvements in diesel engine fuel economy, while continuing to meet legislated emission standards, will require an increased understanding of the diesel combus- tion process. The fuel injection system plays a major role in establishing conditions before and during combustion; and, therefore, its contribution to the development of an optimum combustion system is important. This paper describes a mathematical simulation of the General Motors Unit Injector and its application to the combus- tion system development process. Simulation results are compared to test data from a comprehensive experimental program. 1978 SA E Transactions 780162. Modular Approach to Fuel Injection System Simulation. Madan Goyal, John Deere Product Engrg. Center. In recent years fuel injection systems have taken a more important place in the design of engines because of gaseous emissions, combustion generated noise and fuel economy considerations. Analytical studies to select and match fuel injection system components are becoming of increasing interest. This paper discusses an analytical approach to simplify the performance simulation of the fuel injection system. The analysis uses a modular approach for the system simulation, thereby reducing the programming effort particularly when components of grossly different designs are involved. Several examples are described to illustrate the use of this modular approach. 1978 SA E Transactions 780163. The CAV DP15 Fuel Injection Pump. D. F. Mowbray and M. Drori, CAV Ltd. (United Kingdom). A new distributor type fuel injection pump for diesel engines up to 40 BHP/cylinder has been developed providing performance flexibility to achieve minimum gaseous emissions, and fuelling accuracy over a wide range of fuel temperatures and viscosities. The new metering system in the pump can consistently reproduce a 39</page><page sequence="23">780164-780169 desired maximum fuelling curve and is shown to be insensitive to injection nozzle variations. Excess fuel for starting and external maximum fuel adjustment are also provided. The paper describes the design and special features of the pump, and gives results of tests on rigs, engines and vehicles to demonstrate its performance. 780164. Stochastic System Modeling Applied to an In- dustrial Production System. William Binroth and Roger K. Haboush, Bendix Research Lab., Southfield, MI. This paper demonstrates the application of two stochastic methods for calculating system availability, reliability and downtime for an industrial system. The first method utilized is taken from the Markov process theory of system reliability modeling which allows the states of the system at any point in time to be modeled as a stochastic process. This procedure of stochastic system modeling is quite general and can be applied to many different system configurations, including series, standby redundant, par- allel-redundant, maintained or nonmaintained. The meth- od is applied to an industrial system consisting of subsystems in a series configuration together with a standby spare subsystem with repair maintenance. A critical requirement of the system studied is high avail- ability, since it would eventually be placed in series in an automotive production line. The paper also includes the description of a stochastic failure rate method which allows the reliability analyst to determine the reliability of a system in the face of uncertainty in the component failure rates. Failure rates of the components are com- bined in a Monte Carlo scheme by postulating an exponential life conditional distribution with a log normal prior distribution of the failure rates for all components. An example is included in which stochastic failure rate modeling is applied to a subsystem. 1978 SA E Transactions 780165. The Quantification of Risk in Processes and Products. Thomas H. Pratt, Hercules Inc., Cumberland, MD. A fault tree analysis is used to demonstrate the quanti- fication of risk. The first step is the performance of a sensitivity analysis which gives an ordering of the critical components in the order of their importance. The second step is to quantify the failure probabilities of those components shown to be critical by the probit method using the applicable stress function. Component probabil- ities are reassembled with a data management program to obtain a quantification of the failure probability of the system. The costs incurred and/or saved in adjusting the system failure are coupled with probability to give a cost/benefit analysis. 1978 SA E Transactions 780166. The Synthesis of Fault Trees. Steven A. Lapp and Gary J. Powers, Dept. of Chemical Engrg., Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA. In order for fault tree analysis (FTA) to be useful in the assessment and control of risk, the synthesis of the trees should be: 1) Routine - so that project engineers, etc. will use it. 2) Rapid - so that it won't slow down the project. 3) Accurate ~ so that the results will have some meaningful relationship to the actual risk. 4) Flexible ~ so that the synthesis procedure could be used on a wide range of systems. We present an algorithm which uses directed graph (digraph) models of the cause and effect rela- tionships between variables and events. Given the models, the algorithm will deduce the combinatorially correct fault tree for the system. The models and the algorithm are described and tested on two examples. 1978 SA E Transactions 780167. An Overview of Risk Analysis Methodology. A. Adnan Aswad, Dept. of Industrial and Systems Engrg., Univ. of Michigan, Dearborn, MI. Historically the term Risk Analysis evolved from capital investment studies. However risk is inherent in product development, reliability and safety in addition to cost effectiveness analysis. Often classical probability distri- butions expressing risk are unavailable; and thus it becomes imperative to assess the personal probability distributions of technical experts. Features of three main assessment methodologies and their applicability for quantifying technological risk are discussed. Implemen- tation procedures and the pitfalls to be avoided are outlined. Sample results of a case study for new product development, which were subsequently used as inputs to a decision and control model are presented. 1978 SAE Transactions 780168. A Scale Model Simulation of Vehicle Motions. Shigemi Yoshida, Mechanical Engrg. Lab. A scale model simulation is developed to study passenger car running performance. Emphasis is placed on a study of vehicle overturn according to drastic steering. Two model cars are used. They have suspensions, pneumatic tires, shock absorbers and steer mechanism. As the tests are performed while coasting, they do not need the engine and drivetrain to test the basic running characteristics, the model is continuously given the necessary speed by the rotational arm or by the full size cars. Especially, at J turn, they are shot by the catapult. 780169. Dynamic Cornering Properties of Tires. Takahisa Furuichi and Hideo Sakai, Japan Automobile Research Inst., Inc. The cornering properties of tires while a vehicle is traveling generate a curve different from those in steady state derived from prevailing tire-testing devices. The objective of this paper is to clarify the cornering properties in order to simulate vehicular motions and to make the results applied to practical use. This paper presents experimental data on steady-state tire cornering properties at slip angles of 0 to 90 degrees 40</page><page sequence="24">780170-780175 and on transient tire cornering properties up to relatively large slip angles. This research deals with transient tire cornering properties at slip angles of 0 to 90 degrees. 780170. P Metric Designation Tires - A Comparison to Today's Alpha Designation Tires. Douglas H. Lane, General Motors Corp. A new passenger tire designation system was originated by the International Standards Organization (ISO) and has been approved by the U.S. Tire and Rim Association, Incorporated (T&amp;RA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This paper explains this P metric tire designation system and compares it in regard to load formula, endurance and wear performance, and dimensional tolerance criteria to the current T&amp;RA alpha designation system in use on most U.S. passenger car tires. 780171. Engine Noise Testing in an Economical "Semi" Anechoic Room. Robert Gaspar, Zygmunt Reif and K. Sridhar, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario. A "semi" anechoic room design has been proposed and constructed from readily available, inexpensive construc- tion materials. To demonstrate its feasibility, noise testing was conducted using a rotary engine as the noise source. The results of the testing indicated that the design is functional since free field conditions exist. This condition was proven to exist for at least one angular position measured relative to the exhaust pipe and in the horizontal plane of the exhaust pipe. Other information is provided concerning engine behaviour and type of noise radiated. 780172. Experimental Approach to Reduction Technique for Engine Noise in Passenger Compartment. T. Uchiy amada and T. Kunieda, Vehicle Evalu- ation and Research Dept., Toyota Motor Co. (Japan). This paper deals with high frequency noises in the passenger compartment which are caused by transmitted engine noise. For the purpose of noise reduction, several evaluation methods are developed. For the evaluation of a body transmission loss, a combination of a reverberant room and an anechoic room is used. The noise absorption of the compartment is evaluated under the concept of the saturated sound pressure level. And sufficient standard samples are measured to support the noise reduction development. 780173. A Fundamental Study on External Engine Noise Propagation from Light Vehicles. Eiichi Abe and Akira Kimura, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. In this paper, we have analyzed the problem of the engine noise propagation and have classified that there is a fundamental relationship between exterior noise and structural design. In the case of light vehicles, we have isolated the following 2 factors in structural design which have a direct bearing on exterior noise. (1) The layout and the area of exposed openings in the engine room. (2) The ability of the engine room to absorb noise. In conclusion we suggest comprehensive approach to the problem of automotive noise reduction. 780174. External Surface Noise Radiation Characteristics of Truck Diesel Engines - Their Far-Field Sig- natures and Factors Controlling Abatement. Thomas Trella and Robert Mason, Dept. of Transportation, Transportation Systems Center, Cambridge, MA; and Robert Karsick, Calspan Corp., Buffalo, NY. The engine is an important source of diesel powered vehicle noise, and becomes dominant after proper treat- ment of exhaust and cooling system noise at vehicle speeds below fifty miles per hour. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive study dealing with surface noise radiation characteristics and the ranking of sources on three truck diesel engines. A special acoustic facility constructed to emphasize the acquisition of diesel engine noise data is described. Information is presented on measurement methodology and its viability for quanti- fication of engine noise, directivity, and radiation patterns frorn^ engine surfaces. Acoustic measurements, conducted over a range of engine loads and speeds, include spectral analysis of the sound pressure field derived from a thirty- two microphone spherical array. Various noise identification techniques are explored under comparative testing to ascertain potential candidates for quantification and ranking of engine external surface radiation. For the engines studied, the sound power output varies, depending on design; the loudest being the naturally aspirated; and the quietest being of prechamber design. This range varies between 8 and 10 dB(A) at maximum throttle and is speed dependent. Turbocharged engines exhibit a marked change in sound power output under increased load conditions. This is most pronounced at lower engine speeds. The sound pressure field of two in-line turbo- charged four-stroke diesel engines contained a high degree of asymmetry whereas the sound pressure field of a two stroke vee configuration engine appeared representative of a finite monopole acoustic radiating source. Major external engine surface acoustic radiators, common to all engines tested, included engine front, block sides, and valve covers. Other major external sources were after- coolers and exhaust manifolds for specific engine designs. Oil pan noise, although a lesser contributor to overall engine noise, depends on factors which include the design, material and construction. Finally, comparisons are made of noise data acquired for the acoustic facility and data acquired for the same engine installed in a typical highway truck chassis located out of doors. 1978 SA E Transactions 780175. The Use of High Strength Low Alloy Steel in Automotive Tubing Applications. J. F. Young, The Steel Co. of Canada, Ltd. 41</page><page sequence="25">780177 -780184 In the current weight reduction programmes being introduced by automotive designers, tubing applications are increasing. The requirements for thinner wall sections while retaining traditional loading patterns has neces- sitated the development of high strength steel grades. Adapting these steel grades to existing tube making, heat treating and cold drawing facilities, has resulted in significant new product development. 780177. The Use and Manipulation of Aluminum in Aston Martin and Lagonda Cars. K. M. Loasby, Aston Martin Lagonda (1975) Ltd. In each production of Aston Martin and Lagonda cars, some 600 lb of aluminum alloy is used with methods ranging from hand-forming aluminum sheet into body panels to pressure die casting complex components. Aluminum alloys in their various forms have been used in Aston Martin cars for many years. Initially the purpose was for lightness, especially in the competition field; and this in addition to the relative ease of manipulation and simplification of body tooling has led to continued usage. 780178. The Use of Aluminum in the Porsche 928. Hermann E. Burst and Erich W. Strehler, Research and Development Center, Porsche AG. The Porsche 928 is a 2 + 2 sports car with a 4,5-liter-V-8 engine. The vehicle is characterised by a number of novel technical solutions and is equipped with a remarkably high proportion of aluminum parts which make up about 19% of the overall vehicle weight and which are used in the engine, the gear box, the clutch, the chassis and the body. 780180. Warm Forming the GM V-6 Oil Pan in Alu- minum. Robert A. Ayres, General Motors Re- search Labs, Harold W. Lanning, Brian Taylor and Roger Heimbuch, GM Manufacturing De- velopment; and William G. Brazier, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Research Labs. In order to assess the potential for improving the ductility of aluminum autobody alloys at elevated temperatures, an actual forming operation was carried out on heated production dies. The aluminum alloy was 5182-0 and the die was the GM V-6 oil pan draw die developed for A-K steel. Aluminum parts could only be made at elevated temperatures (e.g. ~180°C) on the heated die and preheated sheet. From gridded blanks, it was clear that large elongations developed in the sides of the successful pans giving a more favorable strain distribution. In unsuccessful parts wrinkling rapidly developed in the flange area inhibiting movement into the die. 1978 SA E Transactions 780181. The Development and Application of Ferrography to the Study of Diesel Engine Wear. Michael V. Hofman and John H. Johnson, Michigan Tech- nological Univ. This paper covers the development of Ferrographic oil analysis techniques for the study of diesel engine wear. A brief overview of the various wear analysis techniques now commonly used in laboratory and field engine wear studies is discussed. Also included in this paper is an in depth description of the Ferrographic oil analysis tech- niques and the various applications of the techniques to the study of engine wear. A comparison of the commonly used wear measurement methods, Ferrography, spec- troscopy and the radioactive tracer methods, and their abilities to measure wear is also discussed. A direct injection, 4-cycle, turbocharged diesel engine was used in the testing and data are presented indicating the abilities of the Ferrographic oil analysis techniques to detect changes in wear rates. The effects of operating time on engine oil and the effects of the variation of oil and coolant temperatures on engine wear is presented. The effects of oil filtration on engine wear is also discussed and data are presented contrasting the filtered versus the non-filtered diesel engine lubrication system. 1978 SA E Transactions 780182. Current Developments in Diesel Engine Oil Technology. F. V. Zalar and D. E. Nisbett, The Lubrizol Corporation. Multifunctional or universal lubricating oils which service both gasoline and diesel engines have gained widespread commercial acceptance. Since 1970, numerous changes and additions have altered the performance tests and specifications which define the quality of these lubricants. New parameters include single cylinder and mul ticy linder diesel engine testing, valve train wear protection, clutch plate friction retention, extended drain interval and lubricant related fuel economy. In response to these requirements, new additive systems were developed. This paper discusses observed base oil-additive-engine test interactions and compares the performance of one of these additive systems to that of the old. 1978 SA E Transactions 780183. Performance Advantages of Synthesized Com- mercial Engine Oils. S. S. Hetrick, J. A. Keller and H. V. Lowther, Mobil Research and Devel- opment Corp. Two synthesized commercial engine oils have been developed and extensively evaluated to document a number of unique performance benefits. The benefits include significant fuel savings in heavy-duty diesel truck engines, excellent low temperature fluidity, engine clean- liness and antiwear protection, extended drain capability, and good oil economy. The results of standard and double-length laboratory engine tests, chassis rolls tests and confirming field tests are discussed in the paper. 780184. A Study of Oil and Filter Change Periods and 42</page><page sequence="26">780185 -780190 Engine Oil Monitoring for GM 6V-71 Diesel Bus Engines. P. L. Strigner and N. N. Kallio, National Research Council of Canada (Ottawa/ Canada). Thirteen new 1965 buses having GM 6V-71 diesel engines were put on various oil/filter change periods from 6000/6000 to 25000/25000 miles, and operated in normal passenger service for seven years (1966-1973). Crankcase oil was tested periodically, and oil filters were examined after scheduled removal. Maintenance and operation records were kept. Finally, at the overhaul point some engine parts were examined. The optimum oil/filter change period was judged to be 25000/12500 miles, in conjunction with field testing for solids load, water and dilution. Correlations and oil test data, suitable for reference, are given. 780185. Paint Adhesion Following Deformation as Relat- ed to the Surface Structure of Hot-Dipped Galvanized Steel. Henry Leidheiser, Jr. and Dong K. Kim, Center for Surface and Coatings Research, Lehigh Univ., Bethlehem, PA. The quality of the adhesion of paint to hot-dipped galvanized steel under severe deformation increases as the fraction of grains with the (0001) plane approximately parallel to the surface increases. Paint adhesion is improved by a small grain size of the zinc and by a rolling operation. The best paint adhesion has been observed on samples with a small grain size of zinc, very highly oriented with (0001) planes parallel to the surface. The fraction of grains exhibiting orientations approximating (0001) was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis and by a newly-developed etching procedure. The effect of grain orientation on paint adhesion is attributed largely to the mechanism of deformation of zinc although the chemical properties of zinc are also a function of the crystal face exposed at the surface. 1978 SA E Transactions 780186. Paint Failure, Steel Surface Quality and Accel- erated Corrosion Testing. V. Hospadaruk, J. Huff, R. W. Zurilla and H. T. Greenwood, Engrg. and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The large variation in salt spray performance of painted steels can be largely attributed to carbonaceous residues on steel surfaces. It has been shown that failure in the 240 hour salt spray test correlates strongly with high surface carbon. The adverse effect of surface carbon highlights the need for stringent control of steel surface cleanliness and for paint primers insensitive to alkaline undercutting. Corrosion tests have been developed which produce service-like failures more rapidly than are obtained with salt spray, by incorporating the use of freeze cycles, surface dust and high test temperature. 1978 SA E Transactions 780187. Quantitative Test for Zinc Phosphate Coating Quality. R. W. Zurilla and V. Hospadaruk, Engrg. and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Zinc phosphated steels representing a wide range of salt spray performance were analyzed for coating weight, composition, X-ray structure, morphology and porosity. Of these factors, apparent coating porosity was the only characteristic that consistently correlated with salt spray performance. An electrochemical test has been developed which measures relative porosity values accurately, rap- idly, and directly on zinc phosphated steels. This tech- nique has been employed to show that the residual carbonaceous materials tightly bound to the surface of commercial steels need to produce porosity levels of only a few percent in order to drastically reduce the effec- tiveness of zinc phosphate coatings as a paint base. 1978 SA E Transactions 780188. Autodeposition - A New Process for Controlling Corrosion. Harry M. Leister, Amchem Products, Inc. An entirely new concept for applying organic films to steel surfaces has been developed and has been in production for two years. This technique relies on chemical attack of the metal substrate and use of the reaction products to deposit a latex polymer which forms a continuous film on curing. The method for application of films via autodepo- sition requires immersion process steps although spray stages are used in cleaning and rinsing. 780189. Cathodic Automotive Electrodeposition. Frederick M. Loop, Technical Automotive Fin- ishes Div., PPG Industries. Cathodic electrodeposition was successfully introduced to the general U.S. industry in 1971. Several properties specific to the automotive industry were required before it could be introduced to the automotive industry in 1976. Cathodic electrodeposition is capable of producing superior corrosion resistance over steel and other substrates. For the automotive industry, additional char- acteristics of high throw-power, lower curing schedules, long term stability, and others were necessary for this paint to be satisfactory to this industry. Many equipment requirements of Cathodic paint are similar or identical to those of Anodic paint, but there are also some specific differences. Operation of Cathodic systems are also similar in many respects to Anodic systems but control parameters such as pH, MEQ, voltage, and conductivity are different. These differences in the equipment and control of Cathodic systems are related to characteristics of Cathodic chemistry. 780190. A Review of the Use of Zincrometal® in the Automotive Industry. Alexander W. Kennedy, Metal Coatings Div., Diamond Shamrock Corp., Chardon, OH. Over one million tons of ZINCROMETAL®, pre-coated 43</page><page sequence="27">780191-780198 steel were used in the automotive industry in 1977. ZINCROMETAL, which is prepared on coil coating lines, is corrosion resistant, weldable and formable. It is available as a one-side coated material. Fenders, door panels, quarter panels, hoods, and deck lids are being fabricated from ZINCROMETAL. The commercial impact has been significant and has benefited many industries. 780191. Automotive Adhesives - Why, How, What, Where. Gerald L. Schneberger, General Motors Institute, Flint, MI. The rationale for the increasing use of automotive adhesives is discussed as are the basic principles of adhesive and process selection. The paper concludes with a brief summary of why adhesives are used in thirteen different automotive applications. 780192. Epoxy-Bonded School Buses. Justin C. Bolger, Amicon Corp. New Federal safety legislation requires school bus body manufacturers to increase the strength of all joints between sheet steel body panels and between panels and support beams. This paper describes two new epoxy structural adhesives, and a new assembly process called "rivet bonding", which is now used for about 98% of all school buses produced for sale in the U.S. Advantages include noise reduction plus substantial savings in labor and other costs when compared to the riveting or other mechanical fastening methods which would be required to provide equivalent joint strengths. 1978 SA E Transactions 780194. Practical Aspects of Air Brake Regulations in Europe. G. Burridge, Bendix Westinghouse, Ltd. EEC Braking Directives mandate several system functions that require special equipment, in order to gain Type Approval. Industry, generally, exerts pressure to ensure that legislation is not design restrictive and, since the major manufacturers of air brake equipment are based in Britain and Germany, where the brake systems prior to 1971 were quite different, there are some interesting contrasts in the valves and system principles employed to meet the same requirements. Interpretation of the Directives and establishment of uniform test methods have given rise to several problems and this continues to be a field in which much work is required. Consequently, a period of stability is sought before further changes are introduced. 780195. The Effect of Hydroplaning on the Dynamic Characteristics of Car, Truck and Bus Tires. Hideo Sakai, Osamu Kanaya and Takumi Okayama, Japan Automobile Research Inst., Inc. This report deals with the tests made on the hydroplaning phenomenon of car, truck and bus tires using the interior of a dynamic tire testing machine. For car tires, the relationship between braking force and slip ratio and between cornering force and slip angle as affected by hydroplaning were investigated. Studies were also made of the influence of the difference between radial-ply and cross-ply tires, inner pressure, load, thickness of the water film, etc. Next, a study was conducted concerning the effect of hydroplaning on the cornering properties of truck and bus tires. 1978 SA E Transactions 780196. The Use of the Mobile Tire Traction Dyna- mometer in Research. P. L. Boyd, A. H. Neill, Jr. and John Hinch, Tire Systems Div., Safety Research Lab., National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Riverdale, MD. The Mobile Tire Traction Dynamometer measures the braking and cornering traction of passenger car tires on outdoor pavements at highway speeds. Its hydrostatic wheel speed control system, wheel loading and positioning system, pavement wetting system, transducers and in- strumentation are described in detail. The data processing methods for its several test modes are explained. Results of experiments (1) to determine the effect of the rate of change of slip on the peak braking coefficient, (2) to identify filters suitable for peak braking coefficient measurement, (3) to determine the effect of the rate of change of slip angle on the lateral force coefficient, and (4) to explore various pavement friction testing methods are included as examples of the use of this testing device. 780197. Evaluation of Various Passenger Tire Construc- tions for Wet Traction Performance. A. G. Speyer, The Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Three basic tire constructions (diagonal, bias belted, and radial) were evaluated via a designed experiment to determine the effect of tire construction on wet traction. Significantly, no one type of construction displayed an inherent advantage for straight ahead wet traction. In addition, investigation within the radial construc- tion framework revealed that stabilizer ply material and angle have little influence on straight ahead wet traction. Tire construction was found to have a significant effect on wet cornering potential. 1978 SA E Transactions 780198. General Motors Water Depth Measuring System. Charles V. Allen, General Motors Proving Grounds, Tire- Wheel Systems, Milford, MI; and Ronald J. Willett, General Motors Proving Grounds, Instrumentation Engrg., Milford, MI. A water depth measuring system has been developed to allow routine and efficient determination of water depths on road surfaces used for tire traction testing. The system consists of a multi-probe transducer unit (which attaches to the front bumper of most standard automobiles) and an in-car electronics package with direct 44</page><page sequence="28">780199-780203 digital and analog readout capabilities. Water depth measurements are taken at one foot (305 mm) intervals at vehicle speeds from two to five miles per hour (3.2 to 8.0 km/hr). Either individual or accumulated average water depths can be digitally displayed to the driver/operator. A system of this type will be useful to tire traction test groups by 1) allowing individual test water depths to be measured and adjusted to a desired level prior to traction testing, 2) documenting the effects of independent variables (wind speed, direction, water pressure, etc.) on test surface water depth, and/or 3) allowing limited adjustments in test data based on actual test water depths and known water depth sensitivities. 780199. Water-Gas Shift and Steam Reforming Reactions Over a Rhodium Three-Way Catalyst. James C. Schlatter, Physical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Lab., Warren, MI. Under oxygen-deficient (rich) conditions, a potential route to maintaining control of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions in a three-way system is through reactions of these pollutants with water vapor (H20). The importance of such reactions over supported rhodium was investigated in the laboratory. The water-gas shift (CO + H20) was insignificant. Steam reforming (HC -I- H20) took place, but gave CO as a product. Thus, if CO conversion governs the rich-side effectiveness of a three-way catalyst, steam reforming which converts HC to CO is unlikely, in itself, to improve three-way perform- ance. 780200. Sulfide Emissions from Catalyst-Equipped Cars. Steven H. Cadle and Patricia A. Mulawa, Environmental Science Dept., General Motors Research Lab., Warren, MI. An on-stream gas chromatographic technique was devel- oped to analyze grab samples of diluted and undiluted vehicle exhaust for the reduced sulfur compounds which cause rotten-egg odors. This method was used to conduct a brief survey of two cars with modified carburetors, four customer cars with odor problems, and five experimental three-way catalyst cars. The cars were tested on a chassis dynamometer using a driving cycle developed for this study. Hydrogen sulfide and carbonyl sulfide were frequently measured. Ethyl mercaptan and fuel sulfur components were occasionally detected. The sulfides were emitted most often when the catalyst was hot, the space velocity was low and the carburetion was rich. The maximum H2S or COS concentration measured in undilu- ted exhaust was &lt;10 ppm. Therefore, these emissions pose no known health problem, but can be an odor problem. 780201. Hydrogen Cyanide Emissions from Three-Way Catalyst Prototypes under Malfunctioning Con- ditions. M. H. Keirns and E. L. Holt, Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Company. Measurements have been made of the emissions from a prototype three-way catalyst automobile, during normal and simulated malfunction driving conditions. Four ceramic-supported catalyst compositions were investi- gated, ranging from Rh through two mixtures of Rh-Pt to Pt. Driving conditions included cyclic and cruise modes. Under normal operating conditions no HCN was detec- ted. Under rich malfunction conditions, HCN was generally observed, even in the absence of a catalyst. In some cases, catalysts appeared to remove HCN from the exhaust gas; in others they increased its level. The highest emission rate for HCN was observed for the Rh catalyst, about 40 mg/km at 64 kph cruise. 1978 SA E Transactions 780202. The Selective Catalytic Reduction of Nitric Oxide in the Presence of Excess Oxygen. George R. Lester, George C. Joy and John F. Brennan, Corporate Research Center, UOP Inc. The selectivities of iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt) and rhodium (Rh) catalysts for reducing NO in the presence of excess 02 in two synthetic fuel-lean exhaust gases have been determined, before and after a severe heat treatment. When tested at 500°C, the order of selectivity was Ir&gt;&gt;Rh&gt;Pt for fresh catalysts, and Pt&gt;Rh for treated catalysts. When tested at 400°C, the treated Pt and Rh catalysts were identical in selectivity to the fresh Ir catalyst. A catalyst called Leanox (Trademark of UOP Inc.) was developed which showed higher NO selectivity than the fresh Ir catalyst. The advantages of incorporating this catalyst upstream of a conventional three-compo- nent-control catalyst to improve NO conversion on the fuel-lean side of stoichiometry were demonstrated in laboratory tests. 780203. Ford Three-Way Catalyst and Feedback Fuel Control System. Robert E. Seiter and Robert J. Clark, Ford Motor Co. The objective of this paper is to describe the Ford Motor Company (Ford) approach of meeting exhaust emission regulations with a three-way catalyst and feedback control system. A pilot program was initiated to gain production experience with three-way catalyst systems in anticipation of expanded usage to meet future emission standards. The Ford system consists of a three-way catalyst with feedback control monitoring the exhaust oxygen concen- tration and controlling the fuel flow to produce a stoichiometric exhaust mixture. Mixture control is critical since catalyst NOx conversion efficiency is diminished when the exhaust mixture deviates from stoichiometry. Briefly, the control loop consists of zirconium dioxide exhaust sensor to indicate oxygen concentration, an electronic control unit, a vacuum regulator to proportion a vacuum signal to the carburetor, and a feedback con- trolled carburetor with vacuum modulated main fuel system. Highlights of the development program and system details are described. 1978 SA E Transactions 45</page><page sequence="29">780204 - 780209 780204. Development of the Nissan Electronically Con- trolled Carburetor System. Kenji Masaki, Shigeo Aono, Mikio Akaeda and Hidehiro Minami, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. An electronically controlled closed-loop carburetor sys- tem has been developed. This system's air-fuel ratio control is characterized by the air bleeds being controlled by turning the solenoid valves on and off at a constant frequency. The frequency above 30 Hz was desirable for practical performances. Some improvements and devel- opments were made to the carburetor, the solenoid valve and the control unit. In application of this system to a three-way catalytic system with 02 sensor, the emissions met the 1978 Japanese standards. 780205. General Motors Phase II Catalyst System. Raymond P. Canale, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation; Clifford R. Carlson, Pontiac Motor Division, General Motors Cor- poration; Samuel R. Winegarden, Buick Motor Division, General Motors Corporation; and Donald L. Miles, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. Three-way catalysts provide a means of catalytically achieving lower NOx emission levels while maintaining good control of HC and CO emissions. However, very accurate control of air-fuel ratio is necessary. The precise air-fuel ratio control required is accomplished by employing a closed loop fuel metering system in con- junction with an exhaust gas sensor and an electronic control unit. To gain production experience with this type of system, General Motors is introducing it on two 1978 engine families sold in California. One is a 2.5 litre L-4 engine and the other is a 3.8 litre V-6 engine. Closed loop controlled carburetors are used on both systems. This paper discusses these 1978 systems. The com- ponents used on both systems are described and emission and fuel economy results are reviewed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780206. An IIEC-2 Low-Emission Concept Car. R. L. Bailey, A. L. Cederquist, J. J. Florek, D. L. Hart and A. H. Meitzler, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company. This paper reports an effort to integrate into an en- gine/catalyst system the best available technologies in electronic engine controls, fuel systems, and catalysts for the purpose of developing a 4000 to 4500 lb vehicle that combines good fuel economy with the ability to meet the 0.41/3.4/0.40 gm/mi emission objectives for HC/CO/NOx. The system has been installed in a 1977 Ford Granada and tested under CVS-CH conditions with two different combinations of catalysts. The results of these experiments, along with analyses of the performance of major electronic and catalytic subsystems, are pre- sented and discussed. 780207. A Worldwide Overview of Automotive Engine Control Sensor Technology. William G. Wolber, Bendix Research Lab., Southfield, MI. The paper presents an overview of developments on the principal sensors applicable to automotive engine control through brief descriptions of the more important sensor concepts for the various parameters, and an indication of sensor status. The parameters covered are manifold absolute pressure (MAP), manifold vacuum (MV), am- bient absolute pressure (AAP), crankshaft position (speed), mass air flow, fuel flow, coolant temperature, air temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and throttle posi- tion. Special sections are included covering sensor developments overseas, and describing noteworthy efforts of the SAE and the International Standards Organization (ISO) with respect to engine sensor standards. 1978 SAE Transactions 780208. The Wiegand Effect and Its Automotive Appli- cations. J. David Marks and Michael J. Sinko, The Echlin Mfg. Co. The Wiegand Effect is a new magnetic phenomenon occurring in a specially work-hardened small diameter ferro-magnetic wire. When subjected to an appropriate magnetic field, a sudden, very rapid flux change occurs. A substantial voltage pulse may be induced in a sensing coil wound around the Wiegand wire, or in its proximity. No electrical input is required, and with the appropriate excitation the pulse is essentially independent of the rate of flux change of the externally applied field. The characteristics of the Wiegand Effect are of interest in a number of automotive applications. 780209. Precision Position-Sensors in Automotive Appli- cations. William Wheeler, Research &amp; Devel- opment Dept., New England Instrument Co., Natick, MA. The use of microprocessors in automotive electronics systems such as Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) and Electronic Fuel Management (EFM) has created a need for a variety of precision position-sensors capable of reliable performance in underhood environments. This paper describes the basics of precision potentiometers and switches which have been adapted for these and other specialized engine applications. A brief description introduces the precision potenti- ometer as a position-sensor, and details the differences among the more common types of potentiometers. The fundamental low cost position-sensor concept is elabo- rated upon with a discussion of some of the special materials and techniques used to develop units for automotive applications. Among the special problems discussed are requirements of long life at high temper- ature, high vibration environment, and stringent per- formance accuracy. Also discussed are typical applications in Exhaust Gas Recirculation, Electronic Fuel Injection, and Throttle Position Sensing. 46</page><page sequence="30">780210-780218 780210. Application of Automotive Sensors to Engine Control. J. N. Reddy, Bendix Electronics and Engine Control Systems Group, Troy, MI. This paper describes the application of automotive sensors to electronic control of the internal-combustion engine, with emphasis on sensor-signal characteristics and utili- zation. Manifold absolute pressure, crankshaft position, throttle position, temperature, and exhaust-gas recircula- tion are among the parameters monitored to electronically regulate engine inputs. Also presented are a number of control concepts realized with these sensors. 780211. Temperature Sensors for Electronic Engine Con- trol Systems. James E. Acker, Electrical and Electronics Div., Ford Motor Co. With the development of the Ford Electronic Engine Control System to meet increasing emission and fuel economy requirements, the need arose to accurately assess engine coolant and inlet air temperatures in order to properly control exhaust gas recirculation flow and spark timing. This paper will discuss the design of the temper- ature sensors developed for that purpose. The sensors meet the functional requirements of the control system and are durable and reliable. The basic design is also readily adaptable to many other temperature sensing applications. 780212. A Zirconia-Based Lean Air-Fuel Ratio Sensor. David S. Howarth and Ralph V. Wilhelm, Jr., Research Lab., General Motors Corp. An experimental sensor has been developed to indicate the air-fuel ratio of an engine operating on lean mixtures. Stabilized zirconia doped with iron was used as the sensor electrolyte. These sensors are internally temperature compensated, eliminating the need for additional tem- perature sensing or electronics. Sensor output is responsive to exhaust oxygen content, but is independent of exhaust temperatures above 450 °C at 18:1. Addition of iron increased uniformity of output among sensors. 1978 SA E Transactions 780213. Application of a Crankshaft Position Sensor to Control Engine Timing. J. C. Cook II, Ford Motor Co. The crankshaft position sensor (CPS) is a variable reluctance magnetic sensor which accurately senses the position of four teeth equally spaced 90° apart on a toothed ring attached to the crankshaft. The electronic engine control (EEC) calculates RPM using two adjacent pulses, and with other processed information, calculates spark advance. Actual spark initiation again uses the CPS as a reference position. The properties and environment of the sensor which determine accuracy, noise, and other characteristics important in its interface with the system are discussed. 780214. The First Production Automotive Capacitive Pressure Sensor. Gary M. Marx, Ford Motor Co., Allen Park, MI; and Robert L. Bell, Kavlico Corp., Chatsworth, CA. A new type of pressure sensor has been introduced into the 1978 production automobile. This design, consisting of a unique capacitive approach, requires the use of only one moving part to produce a voltage output which is proportional to the input pressure signal. The simple construction combined with field and bench performance tests has demonstrated a sensor which possesses high durability and repeatability at a modest product cost. 780215. Electrical Component Modeling and Sizing for EV Simulation. L. E. Unnewehr and C. W. Knoop, Ford Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A method for modeling electric vehicles has been developed and applied in the prediction of electric vehicle performance and range over variable driving cycles. This model is also applicable for studies of the size, power rating, and costs of electrical drivetrain components. The details of the battery and motor simulation used in the model are described. The battery simulation character- istics are compared with the results of life-cycle tests performed on lead-acid batteries. A method for sizing and rating a battery for electric vehicle applications is suggested. 1978 SA E Transactions 780216. A Digital Computer Program for Simulating Electric Vehicle Performance. K. E. White, Exxon Enterprises Inc. A digital computer program has been developed that simulates dc and ac electric vehicle operation. Included in the program are battery, controller and motor models which are designed to be easily modified as new drive systems are developed. The simulation technique used accurately models the time response of the vehicle and has proven useful in the design and stability analysis of vehicle control systems. 780217. Computer Simulation of an Advanced Hybrid Electric-Powered Vehicle. Ming-Cheng Chang, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of California, Torrance, CA. The advanced hybrid electric-powered vehicle features a regenerative power system that uses a flywheel that supplements lead-acid battery power during peak power demands for current leveling, and that converts vehicle kinetic energy to retrievable flywheel energy by means of regenerative braking. The process of energy storage and conversion to propulsion power is accomplished by a unique arrangement of the flywheel, generator, motor, and final power drive shaft connected by a differential planetary gear set. 1978 SA E Transactions 780218. Tire and Aerodynamic Friction and Motor- Driveline Efficiency of Electric Vehicles from 47</page><page sequence="31">780219-780224 Track Tests. John Brennand, General Research Corp. Tests of seventeen electric vehicles were analyzed to estimate tire friction, aerodynamic drag-area product, and average motor-driveline efficiency. The tests included coastdown runs, range over the SAE J227a driving schedules (B, C, and constant speed), and constant- current battery discharges. Analysis indicates that winds during coastdown tests resulted in average standard deviations of seven percent for tire friction, and fifteen percent for drag-area product. Motor-driveline efficiency estimates ranged from 40 percent to 93 percent (fifteen vehicles, J227a/B schedule), and from 61 percent to 93 percent (eleven vehicles, J227a/C schedule). 1978 SAE Transactions 780219. Basic Requirements for Urban Cars. William Hamilton, General Research Corp., Santa Barbara, CA. To find the minimum range, speed, and capacity required to meet most needs of urban drivers, origin-destination surveys from Los Angeles and Washington were processed to determine driving patterns for a typical day. The survey data indicates that ranges sufficient for 95% of driving days would be 75 km for secondary drivers, 150 km for only drivers, and 225 km for primary drivers at urban households. Similarly, speed adequate for freeway use is required to satisfy driver needs on 95% of driving days, with seating for at least two and generally three passengers in addition to the driver. 1 978 SAE Transactions 780220. On the Relationship between Gross Vehicle Weight, Payload, Effective Range, and Cost of Electric Vehicles. J. P. Altendorf, A. Kalberlah and N. Saridakis, Volks wagen werk AG, Wolfs- burg/Germany. The interdependence between gross vehicle weight, curb weight, payload and drive weight is established in general for electric vehicles. Based upon the FAKRA Driving cycle, the range is expressed as a function of gross vehicle weight for electric vehicles equipped with different types of storage devices. The cost for operating these vehicles is calculated and compared. 780221. Mathematical Model for the Design of Grids for Electric Vehicle Batteries. Luther E. Vaaler and Eric W. Brooman, BATTELLE, Columbus Labs., Columbus, OH. The potential and current distribution over the grid of a lead-acid battery can be calculated by applying Kirchoff s Law to a three-dimensional resistance network analog. Such a model was used to simulate the high-rate discharge of a typical grid having a conventional, uniform pattern of grid members. The potential and current density were found to vary widely over the grid surface. Modifications to the design of the grid make the potential and current density distribution more uniform, which would lead to more efficient utilization of the battery active materials, and an improved battery performance. 1978 SAE Transactions 780222. An Exhaust Gas Recirculation System for Diesel Engines. Gerhard Stumpp and Werner Banzhaf, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart/Germany). Exhaust gas recirculation is an effective means to reduce NOx-emissions of Diesel engines. Unfortunately too high EGR rates increase the emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and soot. So EGR has to be controlled precisely. The paper describes an EGR-system for Diesel engines which senses the air-flow and the fuel-flow of the engine and limits the EGR-rate so that the air-fuel-ratio is lean enough for a clean combustion. Furthermore the paper shows the emission results which have been obtained with the described EGR-system on different Diesel passenger cars. 1978 SAE Transactions 780223. Diesel Odor Sampling and Analysis Using the Diesel Odor Analysis System (DOAS). N. P. Cernansky, C. W. Savery, I. H. Suffet and R. S. Cohen, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. and Me- chanics and Environmental Studies Institute, Drexel Univ., Philadelphia, PA. Diesel Odor sampling and analysis techniques and procedures using the Arthur D. Little, Inc. Diesel Odor Analysis System (DOAS) have been evaluated. Reprodu- cibility of ±0.1 TIA unit at the 2.0 TIA level and ±0.2 TIA unit at the 1.5 TIA level are achievable if a consistent, well defined sampling procedure is used. Significant odor sample trap breakthrough and sample volume effects have been isolated. This study indicates that care must be given to defining a standard odor sampling configuration and procedure. 780224. Experimental Reduction of NOx, Smoke, and BSFC in a Diesel Engine Using Uniquely Pro- duced Water (0-80%) to Fuel Emulsion. Tadashi Murayama, Visiting Professor, Univ. of Wis- consin-Madison, Hokkaido Univ. (Japan); Yasushi Morishima, Toray Co., Ltd. (Japan); Minoru Tsukahara, Muroran Inst, of Technol- ogy (Japan); and Noboru Miyamoto, Hokkaido Univ. (Japan). With the aid of static mixer and nonionic emulsifying agent, a comparatively stable water-fuel emulsion was obtained. Engine performance in a 4 cycle direct injection engine using these fuels was studied. A large reduction of NOx concentration was obtained over the wide range of engine operation, in spite of increased ignition lag and rapid combustion. Further- more, improvements of economy and reduction of exhaust smoke were obtained. The reduction of NOx concentra- tion, fuel consumption and smoke were even more remarkable when compared with operating same engine 48</page><page sequence="32">780225 - 780230 with water fumigation. 1978 SA E Transactions 780225. Prediction of Mixture Formation and Heat Release in Diesel Engines. M. Meguerdichian and N. Watson, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Imperial College of Science and Technology (London/England). A multi-zone model is developed to predict the rate of heat release in direct injection diesel engines. By consider- ing the complete air-fuel jet mixing process and temper- ature dependent reaction rates in each zone, the model also enables subsequent spacial and temporal history of burning rate, local temperature and air-fuel ratio etc. to be calculated. It is shown that the model is capable of predicting realistic rate of pressure rise and heat release rates and responds sensibly to changes in injection timing, swirl ratio and air temperature. 780226. Time- and Space-Resolved Species Determina- tion in Diesel Combustion Using Continuous Flow Gas Sampling. K. T. Rhee, Mechanical Engrg. Dept., Univ. of Miami, Coral Gables, FL; P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, Mechanical Engrg. Dept., Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI. Gas concentrations, under different engine operating conditions, different locations relative to the fuel spray are presented. The gas that is sampled is "snatched" from a continuous flow sampling probe. The time of snatching is controlled. The concentrations of CO, C02, NOx, and 02 are plotted against, crank position. The sampled gases were analyzed for concentration in the as taken state and after the sampled gas had passed through a heated catalytic oxidation converter. Analyses have been performed and plots are presented of the findings. The analytic procedure developed for the data analysis are presented in detail. 1978 SA E Transactions 780227. A Study of Pollutant Formation within the Combustion Space of a Diesel Engine. V. K. Duggal and T. Priede, Automotive Engrg. Group, Univ. of Southampton (United King- dom); and I. M. Khan, C.A.V. Ltd., Lucas Industries (United Kingdom). The concentration of pollutants in the combustion space of an indirect injection swirl diesel engine have been studied on a time basis. A fast acting water-cooled gas sampling valve was used for the in-cylinder sampling. The measured concentrations have been used to visualise a simplified reaction zone structure of diesel combustion. The results show that carbon monoxide appears first in the reaction zone followed by nitric oxide and soot. The high soot concentration exists only for a short period of time (3ms) and is rapidly reduced to a low level whereas carbon monoxide is gradually oxidised to carbon dioxide over the expansion cycle. The reaction zone is found to be 10-20mm wide and is widest near the chamber wall. 1978 SA E Transactions 780228. An Experimental Study of Diesel Engine Cyl- inder - Averaged NOx Histories. I. A. Voicules- cu, National Institute for Thermal Engines (Brasov, Romania); and G. L. Borman, Me- chanical Engrg. Dept., Univ. of Wisconsin- Madison, Madison, WI. A method of rapidly removing and quenching more than 75% of the cylinder content of a running diesel engine has been developed and tested. The resulting data give total nitric oxide in the cylinder versus crank-angle. The data show that nitric oxide forms rapidly reaching a peak value in 20° CA or less. For higher loads and advanced timing the concentration overshoots the exhaust value by 14% before decreasing to the exhaust value. A few comparisons are made between the data and four existent models. 1978 SA E Transactions 780229. Correlations of Combustion Data for S. I. Engine Calculations - Laminar Flame Speed, Quench Distance and Global Reaction Rates. George A. Lavoie, Engrg. and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A survey has been made of existing data on laminar flame speed and two-plate quenching distance for the propane - 02 - N2 system. Semiempirical correlations have been derived to express these quantities as functions of equivalence ratio, pressure, flame temperature and resid- ual gas fraction, over the range of parameters appropriate to engine operation. Application of the quench-distance correlation to calculations of engine hydrocarbon-emis- sions is discussed in the light of available experimental data on the one-wall quenching process. Also for use in hydrocarbon-emission calculations, a global reaction rate expression for engine hydrocarbon- oxidation has been obtained by fitting an Arrhenius expression to the available rate data in the temperature range 850°K &lt;T &lt;1250°K. 1978 SA E Transactions 780230. Observation of Flow Characteristics in a Model I.C. Engine Cylinder. Nobuhiko Ishikawa and John W. Daily, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of California - Berkeley. A study of fluid mechanical effects on unburned hydro- carbon generation has been made in a single compres- sion-expansion model automobile engine. Full optical access has allowed color schlieren observations of gas motion inside the engine cylinder. Motion pictures of the gas motion and flame propagation have been taken at a rate of seven thousand frames per second for the following cases: 1) intake stroke 2) exhaust stroke 3) compression power stroke with combustion and 49</page><page sequence="33">780231 -780235 blow-down with appropriate exhaust valve opening. Unburned fuel concentrations were measured by means of a gas Chromatograph. The results show that turbulent motion of the mixture increases the amount of unburned fuel. It is implied that the rolled-up vortices play an important role on wall flame quenching processes in an engine. 1978 SA E Transactions 780231. Spectroscopical Determination of Temperature- and OH- Concentration Distribution in the Combustion Chamber of an Otto-Engine. H. May and W. Mueller, Univ. of Kaiserslautern (West Germany). Spectroscopical investigations of the combustion process in spark ignition engines have been performed by aid of the band head of the OH-band system at 306.4 nm. Using an optical probe system the course of the emission- absorption-temperatures and OH-concentrations at dif- ferent combustion chamber positions could be detected. The experimental results are related to those calculated by use of a theoretical model describing the change of the thermodynamical and chemical state of the gas. Addi- tional measurements were executed at a combustion chamber of constant volume. 1978 SA E Transactions 780232. The Prediction of Ignition Delay and Combustion Intervals for a Homogeneous Charge, Spark Ignition Engine. S. D. Hires, R. J. Tabaczynski and J. M. Novak, Ford Motor Company. Correlations for the ignition delay and combustion energy release intervals in a homogeneous charge, spark-ignited engine are developed. After incorporation within a simplified engine cycle simulation, predicted values of these two combustion parameters are compared to experimental engine data. The correlations are based on four fundamental quantities - the turbulent integral scale, the turbulent micro-scale, the turbulent intensity, and the laminar flame speed. The major assumptions include: (1) The turbulent integral scale is proportional to the instantaneous chamber height prior to flame initiation. (2) Angular momentum is conserved in the individual turbulent eddies ahead of the flame front (i.e., a "rapid distortion" turbulence model). (3) The turbulent intensity scales with the mean piston speed. Two empirical constants scale the correlations to a given engine. Predicted values for the ignition delay and burn intervals show good agreement with experimental results for wide variations in engine operating and design conditions (e.g., engine speed and load, spark timing, EGR, air-fuel ratio, and compression ratio). In addition, the shapes of the predicted mass fraction burned curves agree well with published data. 1978 SA E Transactions 780233. Further Studies with a Hydrogen Engine. Jak Levi and David B. Kittelson, Dept. of Me- chanical Engrg., Univ. of Minnesota, Minne- apolis, MN. This paper describes the performance and emissions of a hydrogen-fueled, spark-ignited engine. An electronic control device, designed to provide the engine with a timed injection of the fuel, is shown to give high mean effective pressures and high efficiencies. The oxides of nitrogen from the exhaust gases have been analyzed and the mechanism for their formation is reviewed. The paper further describes an experiment with traces of hydrocarbons added to the hydrogen in an attempt to explain any additional phenomena that may be taking place during the combustion, such as "prompt NO" which is known to occur in hydrocarbon flames only. As it turns out, such additions have a negligible effect on the NOx formation in the region investigated. 780234. "Wetting" the Appetite of Spark Ignition Engines for Lean Combustion. Bruce D. Peters and Ather A. Quader, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Lab., Warren, MI. Single-cylinder spark ignition engine experiments con- ducted at constant speed, fixed airflow, and using isooctane as the fuel, demonstrated the effects of fuel-air mixture preparation on lean operation. Mixture prepa- ration was changed by varying the time of fuel injection in the induction manifold, near the intake valve port. For comparison, a prevaporized fuel-air mixture was also investigated. Emphasis was placed on determining the effects of mixture preparation on combustion character- istics. Based on the results from this study, the often favored prevaporized mixture of fuel and air may not be the best diet for lean engine operation. Discussion: James G.

Kelly, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA. Cycle by cycle variations in combustion are investigated as a means to characterize the lean misfire limit of a spark ignited, internal combustion engine. The cyclic variations are represented as parameters of the cylinder pressure versus crankangle curves. The specific parameters inves- tigated are peak pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, crankangle of maximum pressure, crankangle of maxi- mum rate of rise, indicated mean effective pressure, and area of the pressure curve. The variations are statistically analyzed on a digital computer. Exhaust gas analysis is performed to determine the correlation between the misfire limit and emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and formalde- hyde. Imep and area variations are found to be the most promising as an indicator of the lean misfire limit. As the equivalence ratio decreases from stoichiometric, the 50</page><page sequence="34">780236 - 780243 variations stay constant, until a sharp linear increase is achieved. Correlation with hydrocarbon emissions shows a strong combustion change occurs at this point of rapid variation increase. This point is adopted as the definition of the lean misfire limit.

Evers, R. D. Fleming and R. W. Hurn, De- partment of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Re- search Center, Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Experimental work was done with a Texaco stratified- charge engine to investigate the effect of fuel type, spark timing, and fuel injection timing on efficiency and emissions. Gasoline, diesel fuel, and a mixture of the two in equal proportions were used as fuels. The mixture of gasoline and diesel fuel simulates a broad-boiling-range fuel, referred to as "broadcut fuel." Data were taken during full-load and part-load operations; the part-load operation simulated road-load conditions for a 3,000-lb vehicle. Results show engine efficiency ranges from about 20% at light-load to over 30% at full-load. The difference in efficiency attributable to fuel type was one to two percent. Between the two fuels gasoline and diesel, greater efficiency was associated with diesel fuel at part-load while the greater efficiency at full-load was seen with gasoline. Broadcut fuels generally resulted in efficiencies similar to the efficiencies of operation with diesel fuel at part-load or with gasoline at full-load. The results for all fuels show that spark timing set equal to fuel injection timing generally produced the best efficiency and, except for nitrogen oxides, the lowest emissions. 780237. The Origin and Uses of the Economy Van. J. E. Englehart, Ford Motor Co. The economy van has evolved through three generations of design changes. From a full-forward control, primarily commercial vehicle first introduced in the U.S. in 1954, it has grown into a semi-forward control vehicle that is no'y used in a wide range of business and personal appli- cations. Sales will exceed 700,000 units in 1977. The versatility of the original compact closed body design has been enhanced by higher GVW's, larger engines, and improved driver environment to meet growing customer requirements. The future challenge will be to preserve essential functional characteristics while significantly improving fuel economy. 780240. Applications of Reliability Growth Model During Light Truck Design and Development. Robert W. Haase, Product Planning, Chevrolet Motor Div., Warren, MI; K. C. Kapur and L. R. Lamberson, Dept. of Industrial Engrg. and Operations Research, Wayne State Univ., Detroit, MI. One solution to the estimation of product reliability during the development phase is to measure reliability improvement over time and compare this improvement (growth) to previous product development progress. This paper uses the Duane's reliability growth model and applies it to some subsystems of light duty trucks during their design and development and prototype testing. The data presented illustrates explicitly the prediction of the reliability growth during development and testing. The data is used to estimate the parameters for the reliability growth curve. Once the model is developed, it can be used to monitor product reliability. 1978 SA E Transactions 780241. Mini-Baja 1977 - An Overview. John Stephens, Univ. of Southwestern Louisiana; and William Shapton, Univ. of Cincinnati. Mini-Baja 1977 represents an attempt on the part of the academic community to increase the industrial readiness of engineering students. The object of this simulated industrial design and fabrication project is to construct a marketable, manufacturable, high-performance one-man, all-terrain vehicle for the least possible cost. Each university started with the same air cooled engine and a $550 manufactured cost limitation. The designs evolved from a series of performance vs. cost, styling vs. cost, and design features vs. cost decisions. Because of the close simulation to the actual industrial design process, engi- neering students have found this type of competition to be a valuable addition to their education. 780242. Design of the Winning Mini Baja 77 Vehicle. A. M. Leppert, Mechanical Engrg. Dept., Auburn Univ., Auburn, AL. The design, construction, testing, and competition of the Mini Baja 77 winning vehicle was performed as an academic assignment by senior Mechanical Engineering students. The nature of the course is explained; the educational benefits explored. The vehicle design criteria and their relationship to the morphology of the design process are developed. The tradeoffs and compromises by the group required to develop an optimum design were extensive. The actual design is presented in a series of photographs, and examples of the required tradeoffs are illustrated thereby. An analysis of the educational benefits of this type of competition is presented along with recommendations for expanding the concept. 780243.

A Rough Terrain Vehicle has been designed, constructed and tested by Mechanical Engineering Students for the Mini-Baja 77 Races. This one seat vehicle has an eight horsepower engine, five speed transmission, independent front wheel suspension and disc brake. The gear train has been matched to the engine performance curves. A 51</page><page sequence="35">780244-780251 wooden mockup was used to establish the man-machine interface. The design and construction of this vehicle was the assigned problem in "Mechanical Engineering Prac- tice".

Exhaust Train Materials for Current Japanese Auto-Manufacturers. Makoto Ohsawa and Yoshitoshi Hagiwara, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. (Japan). In Japanese automotive industry considerable changes have been done in not only design of exhaust train but also materials to be used due to non-leaded gasoline as well as emission controls. Especially application ratio of heat-resisting and stainless steel has increased rapidly and at the same time manufacturing technique and per- formance improvement of raw-materials have been made for heat-resisting steel for passenger cars. We have explained for the current trend in materials used for exhaust train such as reactor, catalytic convertor, other part of exhaust train, engine valves, valve seat inserts. 780245. The Development of a New Austenitic Stainless Steel Exhaust Valve Material. L. F. Jenkins and J. M. Larson, Eaton Corp. The durability requirements of the diesel engine exhaust valve have been satisfied through the use of several iron, nickel, and cobalt base alloys. There have been cases where iron base austenitic alloys were found deficient in one or more physical or mechanical properties, and they were replaced with a nickel or cobalt base super alloy, often with a wide margin of design safety. Strategic alloying elements such as cobalt, tungsten, and nickel have escalated in price at a significant rate, thus increasing the cost of the super alloys. An improved austenitic alloy has been developed to provide adequate performance while retaining the cost effectiveness of iron base systems. During this development program, the alloy was designed to minimize its susceptibility to manufacturing problems which have been associated with prior valve materials. 1978 SA E Transactions 780247. Tool Steels for Automotive Engines and Other Components. E. S. Kopecki, Committee of Tool Steel Producers, American Iron and Steel Insti- tute. Possessing hardness, strength, toughness, dimensional stability, elevated temperature strength and hardness, and resistance to wear, tool steels merit consideration as candidate materials for automotive engine and other components which encounter demanding service require- ments. The properties of ten tool steel grades, which are considered to be most promising for selected automotive applications, are discussed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780248. Aluminum Structural Castings Result in Auto- mobile Weight Reduction. David E. Hatch and John L. Jorstad, Reynolds Metals Co. High integrity aluminum castings are potential replace- ments for cast iron in current vehicle weight reduction programs. Domestically, several cast aluminum structur- al-type components are already realities, saving weight and contributing to improved fuel economy; wheels, brake drums, master brake cylinders and power steering housings. In Europe, suspension components, wheel hubs and disc brake calipers are cast in aluminum for some car models, indicating the functional and economic feasibility of such parts. Alloy and process technology already exist to enable production of reliable, high strength aluminum castings. Domestic automotive product engineers are urged to carefully consider and thoroughly test such aluminum castings along with the many other weight reduction possibilities currently being investigated. 1978 SA E Transactions 780249. Alloy Selections for Automotive Aluminum Cast- ings. G. Leslie Armstrong, Metallurgy and Technical Services, U.S. Reduction Co. The engineer and metallurgist, working as a team, have made a tremendous step forward in worldwide conser- vation of energy. Replacing cast and malleable iron castings with aluminum castings in the automotive industry has greatly reduced the weight of the car. Designing castings in one piece where there is an assembly of component parts is a more economical and mechanically sound procedure. 780250. Machinability of 380 Alloy - Minor Impurity Constituent Effects. John L. Jorstad, Reynolds Metals Co. A small addition of magnesium (0.3%) to prime 380 die casting alloy (SAE 308) was found to improve the alloy's machinability. Magnesium hardens the matrix and by doing so . . . reduces the tendency to build up on a tool edge, . . . results in shorter and tighter chips, . . . provides a better workpiece surface finish, giving prime 380 desirable machining characteristics similar to those of secondary alloy. However, tool wear rates for the magnesium-modified prime alloy were significantly lower than those for secondary alloy. Other minor/impurity element alloy variations also affected machining characteristics but less dramatically than the magnesium. Some elements traditionally credited with improving machinability were found in this study to be of little benefit. 1978 SAE Transactions 780251. Recovery and Recycling of Automotive Alumi- num. Kenneth H. Dale, Reynolds Metals Co., Richmond, VA. There is an increasing use of aluminum in automobiles for 52</page><page sequence="36">780252 -780257 weight reduction and decreased energy consumption. Recycled aluminum can be utilized in automotive castings with savings in both dollars and energy. The technology for the recovery of aluminum from auto scrap is analogous to the recovery of solid waste and the present and developing unit operations are reviewed and an aluminum recovery demonstration laboratory is de- scribed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780252. Plating with Aluminum by Ion Vapor Deposition. D. E. Muehlberger, McDonnell Aircraft Co. Production equipment has been developed for plating with aluminum by ion vapor deposition. This offers a new dimension in protective finishes to the corrosion engineer. The equipment called the Ivadizer™, deposits a uniform, dense coating of pure aluminum which provides out- standing corrosion protection. In additon there are no embrittlement problems, the coating can be used at temperatures up to 925° F (496 °C), and both the process and the coating are environmentally clean. Because of its performance advantages, ion vapor deposited aluminum can be used in a wide range of applications, and is particularly effective as a replacement for cadmium. Interest in and demand for the coating is progressing rapidly in the aerospace and other industries. 1978 SA E Transactions 780253. Mechanically Plated Fasteners in Bimetallic Assemblies. E. A. Davis, 3M Co., Farmington, MI. Mechanically plated finishes primarily used by the automotive industry have been specified for the following reasons: 1) Torque drive relationships. 2) Assured product reliability through elimination of hydrogen embrittlement. 3) Simplicity of coating application and waste treat- ment. 4) Corrosion protection. 5) Multiple coating applications. Current automotive industry trends are toward weight reduction, involving the use of lighter weight metals in fabrication. Fastener components and their protective coatings must also be compatible to the bimetallic surfaces with which they come in contact. Promising new mechanical plating developments are geared toward supplying finishes with characteristics necessary for bimetallic fastening while keeping cost factors in perspective. 780254. Joining and Testing Bimetallic Automotive Pan- els. T. L. Wilkinson and W. H. Ailor, Reynolds Metals Co., Richmond, VA. Reflecting the need for field testing of bimetallic auto- motive body sheet; an extensive program was planned in 1974. Adhesive bonded and weld bonded panels (2036 aluminum and 5182 aluminum with 1010 steel) were prepared and exposed at atmospheric test sites at Pompano Beach, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Chicago, Illinois; and Richmond, Virginia. Exposures were made in 1975-76 and 1- and 2-yr removals and evaluations are reported in this paper. "In-plant" and "After-market" repaired aluminum panels were exposed at the same time. These results are reported here. 780255. Tire Rolling Resistance - A Speed Dependent Contribution. John R. Smith and J. Charles Tracy, Physics Dept., General Motors Research Labs; and David S. Potter, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. A contribution to tire rolling resistance which arises from tire tread impact with the roadway is defined. These impact losses depend on the square of the vehicle speed. The physics of the process is revealed using a realistic, simple model coupled with Newton's second law. It is shown how the losses depend on tire characteristics. It is not feasible to determine to high accuracy the magnitude of the effect from such an uncomplicated model, however. The speed independent losses are also discussed in terms of a simple model. Finally, analytic expressions are presented for rolling resistance (speed dependent + speed independent) as a function of tire characteristics. 780256. Automobile In-Use Tire Inflation Survey. Owen J. Viergutz, Harold G. Wakeley and Larry Dowers, I IT Research Institute. A field measurement was obtained of tire inflation practices representative of typical automobile drivers. Approximately 2000 vehicles were surveyed during a midsummer period, and 400 vehicles during a midwinter period. Inflation pressures covered a wide spectrum with 10 percent being at least 6 psi below manufacturer's recommendation and 10 percent at least 3.5 psi above. During the summer, an average of one tire per vehicle was underinflated by 3 to 6 psi. The winter survey indicated that an average underinflation of 5 to 8 psi was present. A general conclusion is that the typical vehicle has at least one tire in which underinflation could cause serious tire deterioration and substantial increase in the rolling resistance and corresponding fuel usage. 780257. The Influence of Road Surface Texture on Tire Rolling Resistance. L. W. DeRaad, General Motors Corp. Tire rolling resistance losses can be significantly influ- enced by road surface texture. Data obtained from laboratory tire dynamometer tests and outdoor tests conducted on various paved public type roads indicates that tire rolling resistance losses increase as road surface texture increases. Some tires are more sensitive to surface texture than others, and relative tire comparisons may depend upon the test surface used. Developments in road surface texture may be an additional approach to the 53</page><page sequence="37">780258 - 780263 question of tire rolling resistance. Other tire performance areas like noise and traction are also affected by surface texture; therefore, future road surface developments should be based on a consideration of the interaction between surface texture and tire performance. 780258. Sources of Rolling Resistance in Radial Ply Tires. S. A. Lippmann, K. L. Oblizajek and J. J. Metters, Uniroyal Tire Co. The paper treats the following: a. The basic mechanical processes leading to the formation of the rolling resistance of radial ply pheumatic tires, b. Special testing procedures for elucidating the contributions and characteristics of these mechanical processes, c. An assessment of the relative contributions to the rolling resistance from various mechanisms and parts of the tire. 1978 SA E Transactions 780259. A Revised Sequence UIC Engine Oil Test. John J. Rodgers and Richard H. Kabel, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. The ASTM Sequence IIIC test was established to evaluate the thickening characteristics of engine oils as well as to determine their control of high-temperature deposits. It is one of several tests used to define SE-quality engine oils. This paper describes the replacement of the obsolete 1967, 7.0 L Oldsmobile engine with a 1978, 5.7 L Oldsmobile spark-ignition engine. While retaining the capability to evaluate engine oil thickening resistance and deposit control, the revised test also includes the capa- bility to evaluate valve train wear. The valve train wear results with the new test correlate well with valve train wear observed in field tests. 1978 SA E Transactions 780260. A 2.3L Engine Deposit and Wear Test - An ASTM Task Force Progress Report. Dean C. Bardy, The Lubrizol Corp., Thomas M. Frank- lin, EG&amp;G Automotive Research, Inc.; and Charles E. Roberts, Southwest Research Insti- tute. An ASTM Task Force was formed in December, 1976 to develop a Laboratory Engine Dynamometer Deposit and Wear Test. A 2.3 liter, four cylinder engine and an unleaded reference gasoline were selected. Reference oils for which field data were available were obtained from industry. The Task Force defined test support hardware for both engine and test stand. The effect of operating variables on engine deposits was studied. A test proce- dure, based on correlation with field service, is nearing completion. It is expected that this procedure will be capable of defining lubricant performance in terms of motor oil classifications. 1978 SA E Transactions 780261. Target Identification Capability of Swept Fre- quency Automobile Radar. Jimmy L. Funke, General Motors Research Labs. Theoretical and experimental results of an initial study of X-band swept frequency radar as a means of target discrimination for automotive radar are presented. A simple analytical model is used to demonstrate that the frequency dependence of radar returns from an object is related to the number and position of its scattering centers. Experimental measurements show that obstacles such as oil drums and road signs are simple targets comprised of a single scattering center while automobiles are very complex targets having a large number of interacting scattering centers. Analysis of the data indicates that X-band swept frequency radar has the ability to distinguish between simple and complex targets; however, targets posing potentially serious hazards cannot be distinguished from those which do not. 1978 SA E Transactions 780262. A Baseband Radar System for Auto Braking Application. Gerald F. Ross, Sensor Systems, Sperry Research Center. This paper describes a BAseband Radar (BAR) sensor for radar braking application; an early version of the BAR concept was reported previously as a precollision sensor for air bag activation. In this paper we show how the normally wide effective beamwidth of the BAR is narrowed by using interferometry in conjunction with a novel delay line digital processor scheme. The beamwidth of the breadboard system spans a traffic lane width at 45 meters. The paper describes the details of the BAR sensor front-end and preliminary test results sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences. 780263. Collision Avoidance System for Automobiles. Ernst Hermann Dull, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart/Germany); and Hans Joachim Peters, Marketing Section, AEG-Telefunken (Ulm/Ger- many). We believe today that collision avoidance systems can appreciably reduce the number and seriousness of rear- end collisions. The mode of operation of a non-cooperative collision avoidance system is shown. Demands on the radar distance measurement system are described, e.g. questions of radar pulse mode, antenna diagram and choice of frequency. The decisive problem as regards evaluation of the radar echo is the reliable separation of desired and undesired signals. The presented technique uses a time magnification process followed by discrimination ac- cording to amplitude, pattern and echo jumps. In addition, there is a radar range limitation which is 54</page><page sequence="38">780065 - 780273 dependent on speed and steering angle. With experimental vehicles - equipped with the collision avoidance system - over 100,000 km have been covered. The results were very encouraging. 1978 SA E Transactions 780265. Aerodynamic Improvements - A Great Potential for Better Fuel Economy. L. J. Janssen and H.-J. Emmelmann, Research and Development, Volks wagen werk AG (Wolfsburg/Germany). Aerodynamic drag is one of the principal factors influen- cing fuel economy of passenger cars. Techniques are discussed which enable the effect of aerodynamic im- provements to be evaluated utilizing computer simulation. Methods are also presented which enable such improve- ments to be realized. An acceptable drag coefficient of cD = 0.42 can be readily achieved within conventional styling concepts by refining and optimizing body details. "Detail Optimiza- tion" can enable gasoline (Diesel) powered vehicles to achieve maximum fuel economy improvements ranging between 4% (5%) and 7% (9%) above 1977 averages for subcompacts and full sized passenger cars respectively. Contemporary styling concepts placing great emphasis upon aerodynamics enable minimum drag coefficients of cD = 0.32 to be achieved. Application of such concepts and techniques can enable fuel economy improvements of 14% (20%) for full sized passenger cars and 1 1% (14%) for subcompacts to be realized. 1978 SA E Transactions 780266. The Effect of Body Shapes on Wind Noise. Masaru Watanabe, Mituyuki Harita and Eizo Hayashi, Toyota Motor Co. (Japan). In order to reduce wind noise, it is important to minimize the intensity of the noise source itself as well as to insulate the noise. The effect of body shapes on wind noise was investigated. The results are as follows: (1) Concerning wind noise, one of the fundamental causes is flow separation. The most critical areas are the windshield and the A-pillar. (2) A certain relationship between rain gutter height and side window recess depth produces the most wind noise. (3) Wind noise is suppressed if the airflow velocity is reduced around the A-pillar by an object such as the wind deflector. 780267. Aerodynamic Drag of Bluff Body Shapes Char- acteristic of Hatch-Back Cars. Thomas Morel, General Motors Research Labs. The flow around a bluff body with a slanted rear surface is influenced very dramatically by changing the angle of the rear surface slant and at some slant angles an excessively high drag is generated. To learn more about this critical behavior a series of detailed experiments was conducted on a vehicle-like bluff body, investigating the effect of ground proximity, Reynolds number, free-stream turbulence and of rounding of the upper edge of the slanted surface. The results of these experiments showed that although these various factors could change the critical slant angle and the size of the drag overshoot, the basic critical behavior was always present. 1978 SA E Transactions 780268. VMRS - the American Trucking Associations Maintenance Reporting Standards. J. E. Paquette, Burlington Fleet Services. Maintenance records, often talked about, but seldom deemed creditable when management determines that some type of action is required. Comparing maintenance performance and costs has been a frustrating as well as a misleading exercise. In 1969, the American Trucking Associations, Inc. undertook the development of the first uniform vehicle maintenance reporting system by and for the industry. The basic research included for hire carriers, private carriers, government fleets, as well as manufac- turers and suppliers. The end product was released in 1970 under the title Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Standards. This was ultimately shortened to VMRS. Since 1970, VMRS has been adopted and installed in a large number of fleets in the United States, Canada and Europe. The results have been significant. Industrywide data base reports have become available where, for the first time, true and meaningful statistics are being generated using VMRS. Several manufacturers have adopted the VMRS coding, thus we now have available a truly universal system developed for and adopted by all facets of the transportation industry. 780269. How VMRS Helps the Manufacturers. J. C. Arndt, R. A. Burton and S. L. Schwalm, International Harvester Co. The Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Standards of the American Trucking Associations can be used by manu- facturers to improve heavy-duty vehicles. After verifying the accuracy and significance of the data the manufac- turing, engineering, technical service and marketing departments can all use the information to improve vehicles and provide better service to the user. 780273. How the Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Stan- dards Help a Fleet. E. H. Schneider, E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. DuPont operates a medium-sized fleet consisting of 200 tractors and 450 trailers. These units are based in Wilmington, Delaware, and at six other terminals. We have three basic goals in specifying our fleet and in establishing programs for its operation: low maintenance costs, fuel economy, and safety. To maintain our program and to work toward improved results, we make use of a variety of management tools. A major contributor is the Burlington reports. Every maintenance dollar we spend is programmed into the system. These reports provide us with all fuel and maintenance data to accurately determine costs and to 55</page><page sequence="39">780274 - 780280 develop methods to improve existing cost and fuel savings programs. Three examples will be given to show how we use the reports to make some significant decisions in our operation. The first two will deal with replacement of equipment and the third with driver influence. 780274. Consolidated Edison's Vehicle Replacement Al- gorithm. A. Gaydos and E. Radetsky, Consol- idated Edison of New York. An algorithm for quantitative vehicle replacement and repair limitations studies was developed by the Consol- idated Edison Company of New York, Inc. in early 1976. It computes: (a) whether it is less expensive to replace a vehicle or to continue using it; (b) the magnitude of cost avoidance or cost increase that would result from vehicle replacement over a projected period of time. Computa- tions can be performed either manually or with the aid of computer systems. Simulations are performed on the basis of either cost per mile or cost per period of operation. These costs include the cost of purchase, money, main- tenance, fuel and all other associated expenses. The "cost of money" can be applied with any degree of sophis- tication that may be required. This algorithm is currently utilized as a planning aid by Con Edison. It has been computerized as a feature of: (a) the Con Edison Transportation Information System ("TIS") and (b) "Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Stan- dards" (VMRS). Further refinements of both the algo- rithm and computer software are being developed. 780276. Obtaining Accurate Utilization and Fuel Use Data for Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Sys- tems. Roger T. Nation, Ryan- Walsh Stevedoring Co. Inc. A new fuel control system has been developed which records vehicle utilization and fuel and oil use automat- ically at the fueling installation. The system provides security against unauthorized fuel use, is free from any manual input and is very practical and economical to install and operate. 780277. A Study of Automotive Reliability and Associated Cost of Maintenance in the U.S.A. R. L. Mitchell, General Motors Corp.; and R. R. Rutter, Automotive Rentals, Inc. Increasing Governmental regulation, changing judicial policies, greater consumer awareness and expectations concerning product integrity and rapidly rising operating costs are all having a profound effect on engineering and managerial decisions. Proper decisions, regardless of the area of business, require precise and easily accessible information. A research project established to provide sound engineering and cost data on transportation equipment, its systems and components, has provided answers to many questions faced in the automotive industry. Information feedback on vehicle and component performance is fundamental in addressing the effective- ness of design/manufacturing changes which have already taken place. Statistical summaries and detailed findings, historical trends from model year to model year, inter- correlations between field, laboratory and proving ground experience enables greater insight into product modifi- cations still required. The significance of the data have facilitated functional problem analyses on new designs, justified design and manufacturing changes to current configurations and aided preliminary concept definitions for new automated transportation system projects. 780278. Approved Auto Repair Services Program (A Move to Reduce the Trauma of Automobile Repair). Maury Kramer and Louis J. Bintz, Automotive Engineering Dept., Automobile Club of Southern California; and James McDowell, Harold L. Yankelevitz and William Lovell, Automotive Engineering and Road Serv- ices Div., American Automobile Association. The American Automobile Association is a federation of 211 affiliated automobile clubs with 932 offices in the United States and Canada which serve nearly 19 million members. As a not-for-profit organization, each club provides a wide range of services directly to its members and engages in public service activities on behalf of motorists and travelers in general. The clubs constantly review their services and activ- ities with the objective of determining those areas where they can provide significant benefits. The development and implementation of a new pilot automotive repair service program with significant implications for the consumer and the automobile repair industry is the subject of this paper. 780279. Serviceability - A Design Discipline. Thomas W. Johnson, Product Serviceability, General Motors Service Section, General Motors Corp. Serviceability has become a major design criteria at General Motors so that product standards parallel the rising level of consumer expectations. Eight areas of design consideration are explored: Replaceability, repair- ability, accessibility, diagnosability, maintainability, wash- ability, towability, and liftability. This paper gives rationale for serviceability standards among auto manu- facturers and suppliers alike. 780280. Are People Still Getting Bigger - Who, Where, and How Much? Howard W. Stoudt, Dept. of Community Medicine, Michigan State Univ. The human body has been increasing in size in many world-wide populations over at least the past century, according to documented reports. Such increases clearly have implications for the design of automotive equipment. This "secular increase" involves the body as a whole, applies to both men and women, and seems to affect the short-statured more than the tall. Summary estimates for this increase in stature have averaged around 1.0 cm per decade although there may be considerable variability 56</page><page sequence="40">780281 -780286 between studies. The most likely explanations for this increase involve improved environmental conditions, specifically better nutrition, health care, and sanitation. Some groups currently show no secular increase in size. These include those who a) live in environments with less than adequate diets and medical care, or b) have already achieved their maximum body size potential as a result of living in optimal environments for growth. The secular increase in size is likely coming to an end. As more people live under more favored environmental conditions which will enable them to achieve maximum growth, the rate of increase will decline. Future changes, at least in techno- logically developed regions, can be projected at a continually decreasing rate from the former high of about one centimeter per decade. 1978 SA E Transactions 780281. Toward a Computerized Accomodated Percent- age Evaluation (CAPE) Model for Automotive Vehicle Interiors. Alvah C. Bittner, Jr., Human Factors Engineering Branch, Pacific Missile Test Center, Point Mugu, CA. Automotive and aircraft interior designers have common concern with the proportion of user population accom- modated with safety and full capability. Traditional design methods are shown to result in inadequate population accommodation for cockpit designs. An alternative method, Computerized Accommodated Per- centage Evaluation (CAPE), is reviewed and cockpit CAPE models are described. This overview is used as a framework for consideration of potential for CAPE automotive models. It is concluded that a CAPE model for automotive vehicle interiors can be readily developed; and the Edwards et al Cockpit Assessment of Reach (CAR) model should be considered for the base of such a model. 1978 SA E Transactions 780282. Passive Vehicle Safety as Cars Grow Smaller. H. Schimkat and R. Weissner, Volks wagen werk AG. The increasing importance of fuel economy causes cars to become smaller while passenger size requires certain minimum interior dimensions, especially to meet the requirements of passive safety. This has become an extreme challenge to automotive engineering. Providing the highest amount of interior space out of given weight limits while using conventional, cheap and easy-to-handle materials stimulates new design philosophies. Various possibilities of increasing the passive safety of passenger cars by optimizing the structure and restraint systems while retaining the vehicle size, or, while main- taining the same degree of passenger protection, reducing the vehicle size will be described. 780283. CYBERMAN - A Human Factors Design Tool. Dana Waterman and Clinton T. Washburn, Design Office, Chrysler Corporation. In automotive packaging the utility of the design is of prime importance. The end product - the automobile - must not only be usable by all shapes and sizes of people, it must be so designed that it encourages correct use of its controls and devices. The driver should experience no obstructions, distractions or surprises in operating his car. The purpose of this paper is to show how computer methods can assist in solving problems of automotive packaging design in a 3D environment - prior to the construction of full-size mockups. 1978 SA E Transactions 780284. Evaluation of Cooling System Design for a Portable Air Compressor Designed to Meet EPA Noise Requirements. Jagdish K. Patel, Heat Transfer Div., McCord Corp.; and Gerald W. Holland, Sullair Corp. A cooling system design for a gasoline engine powered portable air compressor designed to meet EPA noise standards is evaluated. This paper covers the development that took place in order to devise an adequate cooling system for a silenced compressor with noise reduced by shrouding of the machine with a sound attenuating housing. The successful cooling system consisted of resolving maximum engine coolant temperature and maximum compressor discharge temperature while main- taining a compressor noise level of 76 dBA at 7m. The cooling system design procedure involved is outlined. Noise evaluation at Sullair Corporation, and cooling system testing at McCord Corporation are reported. 780285. Prediction and Measurement of Fluid Flow in Single Cylinder Engine Carburetors. Daniel L. Bajema and George W. Gatecliff, Tecumseh Products Company Research Laboratory. A mathematical model has been developed to analyze fluid flow in carburetors of single-cylinder engines. Single and multi-phase flow are modeled for steady-state-cyclic and transient conditions. This provides insight to design parameter interactions not adequately analyzed with steady-state techniques. The model predicts pressures and flow rates by utilizing an implicit finite-difference solution of one-dimensional equations of conservation of mass and momentum. Example applications and experimental verification are provided. 780286. Transient System Optimization of an Experi- mental Engine Control System Over the Federal Emissions Driving Schedule. Alan R. Dohner, General Motors Research Lab. With the fuel economy and emission requirements more demanding than ever and passenger-car engine control systems more sophisticated than ever, there exists a need for a methodical procedure to optimize the fuel economy subject to emission limits of the entire engine-vehicle- aftertreatment system over the federal fuel economy and emission tests. The optimal feedback control functions 57</page><page sequence="41">780287-780291 should account for: 1) transient system interactions; 2) cold start engine-catalytic converter warm-up dynamics; 3) exhaust aftertreatment; 4) driveability; and 5) any repeatable unknown phenomena which affect end-of-test fuel consumption or emissions. This paper presents an experimental Transient System Optimization (TSO) procedure which meets these re- quirements. 1978 SA E Transactions 780287. Computer Simulations of Emissions and Fuel Economy. Wiplove K. Juneja, William J. Kelly and Richard W. Valentine, General Motors Proving Ground. A simulation of the exhaust emission testing system including a vehicle, dynamometer and driver on General Motors' analog-digital hybrid computer is described. The simulation predicts instantaneous and average results for hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOJ, carbon dioxide (C02), and fuel economy over a predefined speed schedule such as the Environ- mental Protection Agency's (EPA's) city and highway schedules. The simulation facilitates the study of sensitivity of several parameters which influence emissions and fuel economy. The usefulness of the simulation to study the effect of test parameters, test operating conditions and product changes such as the engine, transmission, axle, etc., on emissions and fuel economy is outlined. Results from some of these sensitivity studies are also presented. 780288. Representation of Engine Data by Multi- Variate Least-Squares Regression. Z. Mencik and P. N. Blumberg, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Multi-variate least-squares regression techniques have been developed to screen, smooth and interpolate pollu- tant flows, fuel flow and other parameters of engine performance required for engine control strategy optimi- zation. These methods have been applied to mapping data accumulated at constant speed and load, that is, regres- sion has been performed as a function of air/fuel ratio, EGR and spark timing. In addition, the method has been extended to include engine RPM and torque as additional independent variables, allowing interpolation in the speed/load plane. Concurrently, procedures related to occupancy check for valid interpolation, determination of appropriate order of fit, data set overdetermination and graphical display have been devised. Examples of prac- tical application of regression to engine mapping data are presented. The relative simplicity and accuracy of the regression method make it a valuable tool in the engine control optimization sequence. 780289. Simulation of Wide-Open Throttle Vehicle Per- formance. Z. Mencik, W. E. Tobler and P. N. Blumberg, Engineering &amp; Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Numerical models are described which simulate the wide-open throttle performance of vehicles equipped with either automatic or manual transmissions. Special con- sideration is given to the initial stages of the simulation including the buildup of engine speed and torque from the idle condition for automatic transmission vehicles and the clutch engagement process for manual transmission vehicles. Tire slip and wheel spin are treated by utilizing a semi-analytical tire model which relates tire slip to tractive force. Lateral weight shifts and effects of tractive effort on road load are also considered. 780290. Test and Evaluation of 23 Electric Vehicles for State-of-the-Art Assessment. Miles O. Dustin and Robert J. Denington, NASA, Lewis Re- search Center, Cleveland, OH. The Electric and Hybrid Research, Development and Demonstration Act of 1976 required ERDA to develop data to determine the state-of-the-art of electric and hybrid vehicles. NASA, in response to ERDA's request, tested 18 electric vehicles. The U.S. Army's MERAD- COM tested four electric vehicles and the Canadian Government tested one. Eleven of the electric vehicles were passenger cars and 12 were commercial vans. Tests were conducted in accordance with an ERDA test procedure which is based on the SAE J227a Test Procedure. Tests included range, acceleration, coast- down, and braking. The paper presents the results of the tests and comments on reliability. 1978 SAE Transactions 780291. The Efficiency Improvement of Electric Vehicles by Regenerative Braking. Royji Kasama, Shotaro Naito and Hiroshi Katada, Sawa Works Hitachi Ltd.; and Takanori Shibata, Hitachi Laboratory Hitachi Ltd. Generally in electric vehicles regenerative braking is incorporated to increase urban driving range on a single charge and to get the same brake torque as engine brake. In this paper analysis of the regenerative operation by thyristor chopper control is described. Firstly to clarify regenerative efficiency, the calcu- lation of various losses such as commutation loss and thyristor loss which arises at braking mode is discussed, and it is described that the regenerative efficiency calculated from above losses agrees closely with test results. Secondly newly developed A.F.C. (Automatic Field Control) regenerative braking system is introduced. As in this A.F.C, regenerative control system, using shunt motor, field current is controlled inversely proportional to motor speed and regenerative operation is obtainable by low motor speed, this system is very suitable for electric vehicles. Thirdly it is noted that utilizing this A.F.C, regen- erative brake control actual urban driving range can be increased by approximately 16%. 1978 SAE Transactions 58</page><page sequence="42">780292-780301 780292. Alternative Approaches to Speed Control in Electric Vehicles. G. J. Murphy, Dept. of Electrical Engrg. and Computer Science, North- western Univ., Evanston, IL. The characteristics of series and shunt d-c motors are reviewed, and the use of such motors as propulsion units in vehicular systems is discussed. Consideration is given to forward driving, reverse driving, forward regenerative braking, reverse regenerative braking, forward plugging, and reverse plugging. Both saturated and unsaturated modes of operation are described. Various types of controller for use in conjunction with d-c motors in vehicular propulsion are described also. Both electromechanical and electronic types are included. The relative merits of plugging and regenerative braking are then discussed. 780293. Large Buses and the Townobile Electric City Transit System. L. Roy Leembruggen, Elroy Engrg. Pty. Ltd. (Australia). Internal Combustion and Electric Buses have been in service world wide since 1913, and new circumstances and developments guarantee the expanding use of electrics on environmental, energy and economic grounds in the future. Present large Battery and Trolley Buses in Germany, Switzerland, Britain, Japan, North America and Australia are reviewed as to function, design and operational experience, and compared with diesel buses, trams and fixed rail city public transport. The Townobile Battery, Dual-mode and Trolley Systems can provide fixed rail system benefits at surface level, with much reduced capital and operating costs, and inherent flexi- bility to meet changing travel needs. 780294. A Diesel-Electric Hybrid Bus. Vernon P. Roan, Univ. of Florida. A diesel-electric hybrid bus has been developed at the University of Florida. The drive system is a series hybrid with two lead-acid batteries and a diesel-driven three phase alternator. It was designed with the aid of a computer simulation program, and has undergone three evaluation phases since the initial construction phase. All results to date have confirmed the feasibility of the system including apparent significant advantages in the areas of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. 780295. Decreasing On-Board Fuel Consumption in Heat Engine/Battery Electric Hybrids by Battery Depletion. Victor Wouk, Victor Wouk Asso- ciates. Tests performed on three different configurations of hybrid vehicles establish that significant quantities of on-board petroleum fuel can be conserved by allowing the batteries to be discharged during the driving mission. The depleted batteries are then charged when the vehicle is not in use. Savings of as much as 50% of the on-board petroleum have been experienced with tests on the FDC. On SAE J227a, gasoline FE greater than 50 mpg was measured. Part of the energy for driving is thus transferred from on-board petroleum to off-board electricity generated from coal, hydroelectric or nuclear power plants, with no sacrifice in vehicle performance. The total energy used, when considering the replacement of energy to recharge the batteries, is analyzed. The results are favorable for the hybrid. A recommended new driving cycle for testing hybrids is discussed briefly. 780297. Electric-Flywheel Vehicle for Postal Service Applications. Thomas A. Norman, U.S. Postal Service. The U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Energy have jointly developed and installed a flywheel system in a 1/4 ton electric postal delivery vehicle. The completed vehicle is undergoing test and evaluation. Electric vehicles have the advantage over existing internal combustion engine vehicles of producing minimum pollution and requiring no oil based fuels. Preliminary test results show that adding a flywheel can significantly improve per- formance and increase the potential application of the electric vehicle for postal delivery service without an increase in energy consumption. 780299. The Fluxless Brazing of Aluminum Radiators. J. C. Warner and W. C. Weltman, Alcoa Lab., Aluminum Co. of America. Material, processing, and development experience with vacuum brazing of aluminum radiators is reviewed. The welded, clad tube and bare fin concept is shown to be economically and technically superior to other designs.

E. Wright and J. A. Hirschfield, Research Centre, Aluminum Co. of Canada, Ltd., Kingston, Ontario, (Can- ada). A non-corrosive flux for brazing aluminum has been developed. Use of the flux for furnace brazing is described. The characteristics of heat exchangers brazed by the process are presented. The results show consid- erable promise for economical and reliable use of the process in brazing automotive heat exchangers. 1978 SAE Transactions 780301. Zinc Distribution in Vacuum Brazed Alelad Brazing Sheet. Peter McNamara and O. R. Singleton, Metallurgical Research Div., Reynolds Metals Co., Richmond, VA. Vacuum brazing technology is currently capable of producing aluminum automotive heat exchangers such as 59</page><page sequence="43">780302 - 780308 radiators and heater cores. The possible use of 7072 claddings on the surfaces exposed to the coolant to provide additional corrosion protection is of considerable interest. This paper describes the effect of typical vacuum brazing cycles on the distribution of zinc in 7072 clad vacuum brazing sheet. For heavier gauges (.05"), there is sufficient retained zinc in the post-braze composite. For lighter gauges (.02" or less), nominal composition 7072 does not provide adequate retained zinc; however, if the initial zinc concentration is increased to 3% there is sufficient retained zinc so that the cladding is significantly more anodic than the core. 780302. Laboratory Corrosion Tests on Aluminum Radi- ator Materials. R. C. Dorward, Center for Technology Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp., Pleasanton, CA. Before aluminum can be used in automotive radiators and heater cores, assurances are required that corrosion performance will be satisfactory. Accelerated laboratory glassware tests, however, indicate that conventional aluminum brazing sheet materials may not be suitable under service conditions unless significant improvements are made in corrosion resistance and/or coolant inhi- bition. Although corrosion performance can be greatly improved by utilizing an inner anodic cladding alloy (Alelad concept), fabricating and manufacturing processes would be simplified by using a conventional product in a properly inhibited cooling system. 780303. (SP-428) A Review of Motorcycle Steering Behavior and Straight Line Stability Character- istics. R. S. Sharp, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Leeds. The practice and theory of motorcycle steering behaviour are reviewed. The description of the practice relies part on the small amount of scientific experimental work which has been completed and part on the anecdotal. An attempt is made to describe the current state of under- standing of the subject particularly from the machine alone point of view, but some discussion of rider abilities and requirements is included. The main references in the field are included, and some indications of how further progress may be made are given. 780304. (SP-428) Lateral-Directional Motorcycle Dy- namics and Rider Control. David H. Weir and John W. Zellner, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. A theoretical and empirical view is taken of motorcycle lateral-directional dynamics, handling, and rider control behavior. The analytical development includes equations of motion for the vehicle and a multiple loop feedback model for the control response of the rider/cycle system. Connections with manual control and vehicle response data are shown. The effects of changing fork geometry, operating conditions, and tire lag properties are discussed. Implications are drawn for handling requirements, vehicle design, and rider control techniques. 1978 SA E Transactions 780306. (SP-428) The Effect of Frame Flexibility on High Speed Weave of Motorcycles. Thomas R. Kane, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA. The effect of frame flexibility on the stability of constant speed, straight line motions of a motorcycle is studied by reference to linearized differential equations governing the behavior of a system of five rigid bodies, two of which are connected to each other with a hinge, a spring, and a damper, and are intended to represent a flexible frame, while the rest represent the front fork and the wheels of the vehicle. Although the configuration of the system is characterized by seven generalized coordinates, it is shown that the stability information of interest can be deduced from four first-order differential equations. 1978 SA E Transactions 780307. (SP-428) The Oscillations of a Flexible Castor, and the Effect of Front Fork Flexibility on the Stability of Motorcycles. G. E. Roe, Simon Engrg. Lab., Univ. of Manchester (England); W. M. Pickering and A. Zinober, Dept. of Applied Maths and Computing Science, Univ. of Sheffield (England). Castor oscillations are of prime importance in many situations, from the simple tea-trolley to towed vehicles, the landing wheels of aircraft, and the motorcycle instability problem of 'speed wobbles'. This paper sets out a mechanism of castor instability based on the lateral flexibility in the wheel support. In the case of a motorcycle this is the flexibility in the front fork/wheel system. For small amplitude oscillations the equations of motion are shown to be coupled ordinary differential equations which contain terms representing a relay switching function. These equations are solved numerically for many parameter variations. Close agree- ment is obtained with observed amplitudes and fre- quencies, and with the oscillation characteristics. For certain sets of parameters the numerical solutions are also found to agree well with the predicted solutions obtained using an analytic technique. From the results it is very clear that the most important parameter affecting stability is lateral stiffness, and a new motorcycle front fork of high lateral stiffness is described. This fork has already achieved success on the road, test track and race track. Discussion: Thomas R. Kane, Stanford Univ. 1978 SA E Transactions 780308.

McKibben, McKibben Engrg. Corp. Technical and ideological conflicts exist in the world of motorcycling, particularly concerning motorcycle dynam- ics.

(SP-428) The Human Factors Portion of the Motorcycle Dynamics and Handling Equation. Charles H. Hartman, Motorcycle Safety Foun- dation, Linthicum, MD. A systematic plan is being implemented which holds promise for reducing motorcycle accidents and injuries through motorcycle operator education and licensing improvement. Through a unique public-private sector partnership, motorcycle task analysis research has been completed, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of improved operator licensing examination is on-going. Near-future efforts will test the effectiveness of a motorcycle rider (operator) education course. Improved motorcycle dynamics and operator handling can be anticipated upon completion of this research and development effort. Successful implementation promises a reduced likelihood of accident involvement during the initial months of motorcycle operation. 780312. (SP-428) Rider Skill Influences on Motorcycle Maneuvering. Roy S. Rice, Transportation Re- search Dept., Calspan Corp., Buffalo, NY. The results of full-scale tests in lane change maneuvering as performed by four riders of varying experience with the same motorcycle are analyzed. Measurements of rider input (steer angle, steering torque, and lean angle) and of vehicle response (roll angle and yaw rate at constant speed) are used to compare riding techniques. The effects of skill and experience are examined by means of graphical representations of rider operations. Test course geometry, instrumentation methods, motorcycle charac- teristics, and rider backgrounds are described. It is shown that the experienced rider performs more smoothly and efficiently and achieves a higher limit than those with less experience. 1978 SA E Transactions 780313.

Blaauw and J. Godthelp, Institute for Perception TNO (The Netherlands). In order to prevent aquaplaning and skidding pavements can be grooved or roughened. However, it is not exactly known whether such treatments might negatively influ- ence riding behavior of motorcyclists. In this study riding a motorcycle on roughened and grooved pavements was compared with riding on normal asphalt and cobbles. Overall results of objective and subjective data seem to justify the following conclusions: (1) grooved and roughened pavements indeed may influence riding behav- ior of motorcyclists negatively and (2) in the case of grooves, differences in groove dimensions lead to different effects: small grooves with small interspaces hardly showed an effect. 1978 SA E Transactions 780315. Development of a Predictive Tool for In-Cylinder Gas Motion in Engines. A. D. Gosman and R. J. R. Johns, Imperial College. A method is described of calculating the flow, temper- ature and turbulence fields in cylinder configurations typical of a direct-injection diesel engine. The method operates by solving numerically the Navier Stokes equa- tions that govern the flow, together with additional equations representing the effects of turbulence. A general curvilinear-orthogonal grid that translates with the piston motion is used for the calculations in the complex-shaped piston bowl, whilst an expanding/contracting grid is used elsewhere. Predictions are presented showing the evolu- tion of the velocity and turbulence fields during the compression and expansion phases of a motored engine cycle, for various shapes of axisymmetric piston bowl and various initial swirl levels. These results illustrate the strong influence of these factors on the TDC flow 61</page><page sequence="45">780316-780321 structure. 780316. Numerical Simulation of Flame Propagation in Internal Combustion Engines, A Status Report. A. A. Boni, Science Applications, Inc., P.O. Box 2351, La Jolla, CA 92038. Better methods of analyzing combustion dynamics in internal combustion (IC) engines are needed as a con- sequence of increasing demands for greater thermal efficiency, lower pollutant output, and improved fuel flexibility. In response to these needs, both improved diagnostic devices and computational techniques are being developed. Together, these developments may lead to a more detailed understanding of the combustion process. In particular, advanced numerical simulation techniques may ultimately produce the capability of calculating both the spatial and temporal evolution of the fuel/air mixture for the IC engine cycle as well as the combustion process itself. During the last several years, a number of publications have appeared, describing both one-dimensional and two-dimensional, transient computer codes which indicate steady progress toward the goal of a computational tool which is capable of making per- formance predictions at a reasonable cost. In the present paper, we briefly review this progress from the point of view of establishing the current predictive capability and indicate both the capabilities and limitations which currently exist. Areas requiring further improvements are pointed out and approaches currently envisioned for resolving computational difficulties are discussed. 780318. A Theoretical Model for Two-Phase Fuel Injec- tion in Stratified Charge Engines. L. C. Hasel- man and C. K. Westbrook, Lawrence Livermore Lab., Univ. of California, Livermore, CA. A theoretical model has been developed for calculations of the evolution of fuel injected into internal combustion engine chambers. Fuel injection in the form of a gaseous jet and in the form of a liquid droplet spray are considered. The model uses the basic equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in both the gaseous and liquid phases. Applications in two dimen- sional symmetry of the gaseous jet form of the numerical model are described in stagnant and swirling air flows. The liquid droplet spray model, including coupling between the droplets and the gas phase medium, is described. Applications of the two phase model are described for the case of axially symmetric injection. Finally, the liquid spray model and the gas jet model are applied to the same conditions, leading to a general assessment of the ranges of validity of the gas jet model. 780319. Simulation of Thermodynamic Cycle of Three- Valve Stratified Charge Engine. T. Asanuma, Tokai Univ., M. K. Gajendra Babu, Indian Institute of Technology; and S. Yagi, Honda R &amp; D Co., Ltd. This paper describes the development of a mathematical model for the compression, combustion, expansion, exhaust and intake processes of a three-valve stratified charge engine. After calculating the mixture formation at the end of compression process, a simple combustion model was developed to compute the gas temperature, gas pressure and the rate of formation of NO and CO at each crankangle, using basic energy and reaction kinetic equations for both the auxiliary and main chambers. The evaluation of the model was carried out by comparing the computed and experimental data. A satisfactory correlation was observed between them. 1978 SA E Transactions 780320. Parametric Studies of Performance and NOx Emissions of the Three- Valve Stratified Charge Engine Using a Cycle Simulation. John C. Wall, John B. Heywood and William A. Woods, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The trade-off between engine operating efficiency and NOx emissions in the prechamber three-valve stratified- charge engine is examined in a series of parametric studies using an improved model developed at M.I.T. (1). Engine geometric, operating, and combustion parameters are varied independently and the effects on brake-specific- fuel-consumption, exhaust temperature and brake-spe- cific-NO observed. Parameters chosen for study are: timing of the start of combustion, overall air-fuel ratio, prechamber air-fuel ratio at the start of combustion, main-chamber combustion duration, prechamber size (prechamber volume and orifice diameter), EGR (in main and prechamber intakes), and load. The results quantify trade-off opportunities amongst these design and oper- ating variables which are available to the engine designer. 1978 SAE Transactions 780321. Knock Perception - A 1975 Customer/ Rater Study by CRC. Wilfred E. Bettoney and John D. Rogers, Jr., E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Jack D. Benson, General Motors Research Lab., Billy D. Keller, Amoco Research Center, Amoco Oil Co.; and Gerald W. Stanke, Ethyl Corp. Octane requirements of late model vehicles were deter- mined by trained knock raters and compared with those determined by customers. Average differences of independent distributions of customer and rater requirements were about 3 Research Octane Numbers/2 Motor Octane Numbers at part- throttle and 6 RON/4 MON at full-throttle and maximum octane requirement conditions. Five percent of the customers objected to knock when their cars were operated on fuel matching rater require- ments, while 50 percent objected when using fuel 6 RON/4 MON lower. Another program is planned because differences between rater and customer octane requirements were greater than expected. 1978 SAE Transactions 62</page><page sequence="46">780322 - 780330 780322. Technical Versus Customer Knock Satisfaction Two Decades. E. S. Corner, A. M. Hochhäuser and H. F. Shannon, Exxon Research and Engineering Company. This paper reviews 20 years of data dealing with customer reaction to gasoline octane quality. Four technical studies and one marketing survey are covered. An analysis of the data shows that customer reaction to engine knock has not changed during this period. Agreement among three of the technical studies was good. ARON, the difference in Research Octane Number requirements between trained observers and customers, varied from 3.0 RON at the 50th percentile satisfaction level to 1.7 RON at the 90th percentile satisfaction level. The marketing survey shows that these values of ARON are a good measure of the number of customers in the marketplace who consider knock to be a problem. The fourth technical study measured ARON to be at least twice as large as the values in the other studies. This discrepancy is traced to the design of the questionnaire used to evaluate customer reaction to knock. 1978 SA E Transactions 780323. Studies of Customer Awareness of Knock. W. E. Bettony, J. D. Rogers, Jr. and J. E. Riegei, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). The influence of driving procedures and extraneous car noise on perception of engine knock has been studied with late model cars. Year to year changes in reports of knock by both customers and raters and changes in octane requirements were also reviewed. Customers generally accelerated cars less vigorously and tended to perceive knock less often than raters. However, in cars that had maximum octane requirements at part-throttle, customers perceived knock about as frequently as raters. Octane requirements, as determined by raters, were reduced by about 2 Research Octane numbers when the car radio was turned on and the windows closed. Both customers and raters reported more knock with 1975-1977 model cars than with earlier models. Since 1975, octane requirements of certain car models tended to be adjusted to the octane quality of available gasoline. 780324. Low Vapor Pressure Isocyanates for High Resil- ient Urethane Foam.

A Distributorless Ignition System - Solid State High Voltage Distribution with Low RFI Emis- sions. J. R. Asik, D. F. Moyer and W. G. Rado, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. By utilizing high voltage diodes, a special ignition coil, and a special electronic module, a distributorless ignition system (DIS) having solid state high voltage distribution has been designed and constructed. The ignition coil has two opposite polarity high voltage outputs that alternate in phase upon each firing. Each high voltage terminal is connected to two spark plugs through a pair of high voltage diodes that are arranged in back-to-back polarity. The basic DIS package is suitable for igniting a four cylinder engine. DIS has significant advantages in the areas of RFI emissions, packaging, and "rotor registra- tion". 1978 SA E Transactions 780328. Recent Trends in Automotive Ignition Specifi- cations and Materials. Milton C. Murray, Dow Corning Corporation. The use of silicone rubber in OEM ignition cable has grown very rapidly. Because of this rapid growth and the lack of uniform test procedures, a variety of new specifications have evolved. Soon there will be an increased demand for silicone aftermarket cable. Unless something is done now to classify and consolidate these requirements, a profusion of new and unrelated speci- fications will evolve. This can only lead to confusion, additional cost, and perhaps unsatisfactory performance. This problem can be minimized if SAE J557 is revised to encompass the new requirements. 780329. Laser Ignited Internal Combustion Engine - An Experimental Study. J. D. Dale, Dept. of Me- chanical Engrg., Univ. of Alberta (Edmonton/ Alberta); P. R. Smy, Dept. of Electrical Engrg., Univ. of Alberta (Edmonton/ Alberta); and R. M. Clements, Physics Dept., Univ. of Victoria (Victoria/British Columbia). Preliminary test results are presented for an S.I. engine which used a focused laser beam and conventional spark ignition as ignition sources. The results show that for a steady running single-cylinder engine with MBT spark timing and fixed throttle position, engine performance and efficiency are improved, extension of the lean limit of operation by 5 air-fuel ratios is possible, and more NO is produced with laser ignition. The effects of EGR are also examined. The CO and HC emissions are essentially the same. With the laser, the spark location was found to have little effect on performance except when it was moved near the combustion chamber wall. The minimum laser pulse energy required for steady engine operation seems to be dictated by the minimum energy required to achieve breakdown of the laser pulse in air at the same pressure. 1978 SAE Transactions 780330.

Grimes, Bendix Autolite Corp., Fostoria, OH. 63</page><page sequence="47">780331 -780337 Scanning electron microscopy and microchemical anal- yses were conducted to determine the electrode erosion mechanisms of two different spark plugs, platinum-tip and nickel-alloy plugs, tested under various environments. The electrodes were eroded differently depending on the electrode materials and the operating environments. In bench test performed in a dry air pressure chamber, ejection of small molten particles from center electrodes and vaporization loss of side electrodes were the pre- dominant erosion processes. In vehicle tests, the erosion mechanisms varied with the additives in the fuels used. Oxidation of base metal and electrode corrosion by fuel residues were the common erosion processes observed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780331. On the Interaction of a Two-Pin-Disc System with Reference to the Generation of Disc-Brake Squeal. S. W. E. Earles, King's College (London/England); and M. N. M. Badi, Queen Mary College (London/England). Previous investigations using a single-pin-disc system have suggested that the mechanism of disc brake squeal is explainable in terms of a geometrically induced or kinematic constraint instability. The experimental results and theoretical analysis to be presented further endorse this idea while demonstrating that interactive coupling effects using a two-pin system can produce both enlarged and reduced regions of noise generation. Two steel pins independently supported on flexible cantilevers are pressed into contact with a steel disc which rotates at a constant speed. Assuming the system to be undamped and having linear characteristics, the pin subsystems are each modelled to have three degrees- of-freedom and the disc to have a single degree-of- freedom. The unstable regions are shown to depend primarily on the orientations of the pins to the disc surface. For similar orientation angles the unstable regions are comparable with those produced for a single pin while for dissimilar angles there are configurations of the system which develop reduced regions of instability. Experimental recordings of squeal noise generation are in general agreement with the theoretical prediction, which leads to the conclusion that the occurrence of disc-brake squeal noise may be reduced by arranging the pads to react in a dissimilar manner on the disc. 780332. An Analysis of Disc Brake Squeal. N. Millner, Ferodo Ltd. A squeal model for a proprietary fixed caliper disc brake is proposed which includes mass and stiffness parameters and allows for variations in the contact configuration of the pad and piston.

Oscillations in Squealing Disc Brakes - Analysis of Vibration Modes by Holographic Interferom- etry. A. Felske, G. Hoppe and H. Matthäi, Research and Development Div., Volkswagen- werk AG (Wolfsburg/W. Germany). Analyses of squealing disc brakes generally show main frequencies from 1 to 10 kHz. On a test stand holograms exposed by time average and double-pulse techniques are recorded from various types of disc brakes. Photographs of reconstructions from those holograms display a vibration pattern in a simple topographical map of fringes, which represents contours of equal vibration amplitudes on the brake components: That would be i.e. yoke-type or fist-type calipers, brake pads and brake disc. Holographic Vibration Analysis is a useful method for looking at these small vibration amplitudes to understand different mechanisms of coupling. Also it is possible to localize vibration sources in squealing disc brakes. 1978 SA E Transactions 780334. The Analytical Basis of Automobile Coastdown Testing. Thomas P.

The J. A.R.I. Full-Scale Wind Tunnel. Shinri Muto, Japan Automobile Research Inst., Inc.; and Tomo-o Ishihara, Univ. of Tokyo. Our institute, J.A.R.I., has built a new wind tunnel to accommodate full-sized vehicles. Various newly developed ideas were incorporated in this facility, which, nearly 100 m long, is of Eiffel type with two test sections arranged lengthwise that can be used simultaneously and efficient- ly. Wind velocity ranges from 2.5 to 57 m/s in the first test section, which is 3 m (H)x4 m(W)Xl0 m(L). In the second test section, which is 5 m(H)x6 m(W)X 13 m(L), the wind velocity ranges from 1 to 23 m/s. The facility enables a wide range of aerodynamic experiments to be conducted with 1/5 scale models up to full-sized passen- ger cars in the first test section, as well as with heavy duty trucks and buses in the second test section. 780337.

The aerodynamic resistance was a function of the instantaneous wind direction and speed relative to the car. A wind spectrum having an annual speed of 10 mph will increase the zero-yaw aerodynamic resistance by 16% for the Combined driving cycle. Several simplistic approaches were evaluated against rigorously obtained results. 1978 SA E Transactions 780338. Interoperability - The Answer to International Standardization of Combat Vehicles. Lyle A. Wolcott, XM1 Tank System Project Manager's Office. The concept of interoperability is based upon standard- ization of combat vehicles at the subsystem level. Past attempts at international system level development have been frustrated by such factors as a diversity of design philosophy, deployment schedules, production unit cost, and an economic need to maintain commonality with existing national fleets. The logistics potential of common equipment has resulted in renewed interest concerning the use of standardized components. In addition, the here- tofore unaddressed area of common crew/equipment interfaces is being investigated. Through careful attention to human factors, a measure of system level standardi- zation may be attained. 780339. Outside Rearview Mirror Requirements for Pas- senger Cars - Curvature, Size, and Location. Seiichi Sugiura and Kenji Kimura, Toyota Motor Co. (Japan). Primary design factors with regard to outside mirrors are curvature, size and spatial localization. Experiments were conducted to find the effects of these factors in relation to visibility and the size of field of view. Investigations to determine visibility requirements were static testing and field testing. The results show that convex mirrors with 47 inch radius of curvature are most preferable for the visibility requirements. Required size of field of view was established taking into account the size of direct field, vehicle size and lateral distance to another car. 1978 SA E Transactions 780340. Investigation into the Identification and Inter- pretation of Automotive Indicators and Controls. Joachim Elsholz and Manfred Bortfeld, BMW AG (München/Germany). The identification of present indicators and controls were tested in several series with 100 subjects having varied demographic backgrounds and their statements evaluated as to the individual technical functions. In tests with another 50 persons, we measured the learning effects as functions of both the individual labels and the various demographic groups. Evaluation of these test series shows the influence of the different demographic data among the persons tested. With 150 subjects tested in European cars the driver's expectations as to where a specific control is located and what specific manipulation he associates with this control was investigated. 780341.

Engines with Stratified Charge. Niyazi A. Kerimov and Rafie I. Mektiev, Dept. of Internal Combustion Engrg., Azerbaijan Polytechnic Institute (Baku/USSR). A method of working fuel injection engines with stratified charge and prechamber- torch ignition is presented. Ejec- tion effect has been employed for cleaning the prechamber of burnt gases and filling the same with air-fuel mixture of necessary composition. The ejection effect is produced by the fuel jet injected through the prechamber which makes it possible to scavange the prechamber without the use of third valve. Besides, this method provides necessary stratification of charge along the direction of flow of burnt gases out of the prechamber. Investigations carried out on single cylinder research test bench and on experimental multicylinder engine created by modifying the serially produced automotive engine show that the proposed method of working makes it possible to improve the power and economy parameters of the engine with sharp reduction of toxic components in the exhaust gases at the same time. 780343. Dynamometer-Based Evaluation of Low Oxides of Nitrogen, Advanced Concept Diesel Engine for a Passenger Car. Robert W. Talder, James D. Fleming, Donald C. Siegla and Charles A. Amann, General Motors Research Lab. An Advanced Concept Diesel (ACD) engine, previously evaluated under a U.S. Energy Research and Devel- opment Administration contract, was dynamometer tested to provide data for the computer simulation of a diesel passenger car. The car was calculated to have the potential for meeting a 0.25 g/km (0.4 g/mi) NO standard (without cold start) if high EGR rates were introduced. The 0.25 g/km (0.41 g/mi) hydrocarbon standard would not be met by the unmodified vehicle, although use of an advanced transmission was projected to decrease hydrocarbons just to that level. Before the ACD engine is considered further, adequate durability should be demonstrated with high EGR rates, and lower hydrocarbon emissions are needed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780346.

The Moving Baseline of Conventional Engine- Powered Passenger Cars (1975-1985). Andrew F. Burke, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Insti- tute of Technology. The moving baseline of conventional engines and pas- senger cars utilizing such engines in the period 1975-1985 is developed from a review of recent trends in vehicle Resign and conventional engine and transmission devel- opment. The moving baseline is given in terms of engine specific weight and volume and vehicle fuel economy and energy intensity on both the EPA urban and highway cycles. Recent advances in conventional engine and vehicle design have led to significant improvements in all the baseline areas. These improvements are discussed quantitatively in the paper. 780348. Weight Propagation and Equivalent Horsepower for Alternate-Engined Cars. Gerhard J. Klose and Donald W. Kurtz, Jet Propulsion Lab, California Inst, of Technology. In order to properly evaluate the consequences of replacing conventional Otto-cycle engines with alternate power systems, comparisons must be carried out at the vehicle level with functionally equivalent cars. This paper presents the development and application of a procedure for establishing equivalent vehicles. A systematic weight propagation methodology, based on detailed weight breakdowns and influence factors, yields the vehicle weight impacts due to changes in engine weight and power. Performance-matching criteria, utilizing a vehicle simulation program, are then employed to establish Otto-engine-equivalent vehicles, whose characteristics can form the basis for alternative engine evaluations. 780349.

The engine is characterized by the use of direct fuel injection system, square toroidal combustion chamber, glow plug as a starting aid, thin dry chrome plated cylinder liners, engine stop system using air shutter, and newly-developed variable speed RLD-K governor with torque control cam, all of which are discussed here from aspects of design and experiment. Also covered are family engine concept and emission and noise control approaches. 780350. The Detail Design of Colette Calipers. C. N. Mathias and A. P. Stott, Girling Ltd. (Lucas Industries). This paper gives analytical expansion to the possibilities facing a designer when dealing with detail design problems of the Girling Colette caliper.

Thermal Analysis of Vented Brake Rotors. Albert E. Sisson, Bendix Research Labs. Duhamel's theorem is used to integrate an analytical slab solution with a nodal solution to utilize the advantages of each method. The analytical part of the model provides a detailed temperature distribution through the rotor rims which is used to estimate the rim thermal stresses. Experimental results are used to derive a model of the vent cooling. Brake dynamometer tests are compared to the calculated results to verify the model. Some examples of parameter variations are given that show typical model capabilities. 1978 SA E Transactions 780353. Full-Power Parking Emergency Brakes and Fail- Safe on 4- Wheel Disc Brakes. M. A. Yamamoto, Krestbuch Engrg., San Bernardino, CA. The brakes are applied automatically at the time of any system failure. The parking brake is operated by the parking/emergency switch on the dash panel or the ignition switch, without physical effort as found in the conventional hydraulic brake systems. Full-power parking/emergency brakes and fail-safe concepts have been accomplished in the straight-air brake systems. However, duplication of these systems to hydraulic brake systems incurred some difficulties due to the physical properties of fluid, and it is generally concluded that the parking/emergency brakes must be mechanical brakes, and the hydraulic pressure should not be maintained for extended periods of time. The electro-mechanical method 66</page><page sequence="50">780354-780361 employing a detent system is a breakthrough in restraining spring force during normal operation. 780354. Reaction Injection Molding with Glass Fiber Reinforcement. Allan B. Isham, Owens-Corning Fiberglas, Technical Center, Granville, OH. Thermosetting liquid urethanes processed by reaction injection molding (RIM) can be reinforced with glass fibers. Special considerations of both the materials and the process system elements are required due to the char- acteristics of the reinforcement. Typically, slurries are prepared with milled glass fibers and one or both of the liquid urethane components. Then the urethane components are combined with mechanical and/or impingement mixing and injected into a mold. The resulting composites show increased stiffness and reduced thermal expansion due to the glass fiber rein- forcement. These new material systems are expected to be used in many applications requiring good dimensional stability over a wide temperature range. 1978 SA E Transactions 780355. Structural SMC - Material, Process and Per- formance Review. Ralph B. Jutte, Owens- Corning Fiberglas Technical Center, Granville, OH. Sheet molding compound (SMC) has been used for functional or fascia automotive parts such as front and rear panels for several years. When properly formulated, processed, and molded, SMC has a potentially substantial role in the manufacture of more structurally demanding automotive parts. Through variations in the materials, equipment and processing techniques, different types of SMC can be produced. These are random fiber SMC (SMC-R); continuous fiber SMC (SMC-C); and directional fiber SMC (SMC-D). Representative formulations show how static me- chanical properties are dependent upon glass content, glass orientation, and on the test temperature. Based on equivalent performance, these systems are lighter in weight than steel and are generally less costly, on a material basis, than aluminum. 780356. Dynamic Response of Structural Panels with Polyurethane Foam Layers. Young K. Kim and Herbert B. Kingsbury, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE; and William R. Powers, Speciality Com- posites Inc. Newark, DE. This paper investigates the dynamic response character- istics of multilayer panels containing polyurethane foam layers. Results of driving point impedance tests on multilayer beam and circular plate structures in the frequency range 200hz - 3khz are compared with corresponding results obtained using commercial damping coatings. It is shown that configurations consisting of metal and solid polymer facings with foam cores exhibit highly attenuated response at selected frequencies. The hypothesis that the layered foam configuration acts as a dynamic vibration absorber is confirmed using a mathematical model of a sandwich beam which permits transverse deformation of the core. 780357. Silicone Fluids as Internal Processing Aids for Thermoplastics. Richard F. Smith, Dow Corning Corp. The addition of a high molecular weight Silicone Fluid to most thermoplastics results in numerous processing advantages and cost savings. These fluids are mechanically blended with the resin melt to form stable polyblends. Addition to injection molding equipment or extruders can be accomplished either by utilizing a small metering pump or adding the fluid in a pelletized concentrate form similar to color concentrates. Excellent dispersion of the fluid in the resin results when done properly by either method. The fluid remains in the molded or extruded part in the form of small cells or droplets 2 - 4/x in size. The fluid exhibits no tendency to migrate or bleed. Fabricated parts may be decorated without the need for part cleanup. 780358. Advanced Concepts in Automobile Weight Re- duction Using High Performance Plastics. Richard F. Waughtal, E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. Reduction in vehicle weight is a key goal for today's automobile design. This is being accomplished, in part, by replacement of metal components with lighter weight, multifunctional engineering plastics and composites. Additional weight reduction potential exists, however, through the use of high performance plastic parts from aramid and polyimide resins. The weight reducing value attributable to parts from these materials emanates from their high performance properties, and not necessarily their light weight. Superior properties allow the aramid and polyimide parts to be used in applications involving bearing loads, moving contact speeds and temperatures found too severe for other plastics. The principal benefit of their use is the designer's ability to downsize compan- ion metal parts and to more readily incorporate light- weight metals such as aluminum. This paper describes application and design concept areas where high performance plastic parts can contribute to achievement of improved functionality at a cost-benefit level consistent with automotive requirements. Physical properties important to engineering design, such as, strength, creep resistance, thermal expansion, wear life (in both lubricated and dry systems) and frictional charac- teristics are highlighted. 780361. The Production of Precision Automotive Com- ponents by the Powder Forging Process - Present Situation and Future Prospects. P. K. Jones and J. W. Wisker, G.K.N. Powder Forging, Div. of 67</page><page sequence="51">780362 - 780365 G.K.N. Forgings Ltd. During the last decade Powder Forging, a technique by which very precise components of high mechanical integrity and requiring minimal machining can be pro- duced, has been the subject of intensive development activity. Powder Forging has now reached maturity; many parts are in volume commercial production, and all indications are that growth prospects are excellent. Users of parts are becoming increasingly aware of the machin- ing, labour, investment and energy savings that can arise from adoption of the process. GKN Forgings Limited now has about thirty parts in commercial production, and a new self-contained oper- ating Company has been established devoted entirely to Powder Forging. The paper reviews the current status of Powder Forging and describes by reference to actual components the economic and technical factors that dictate the types of parts that are best suited to manufacture by this method. Future growth predictions for Powder Forgings are discussed. Internal developments and external influences that could effect, and possibly increase this growth rate are reviewed. 780362. Vibration Analysis of Corrugation-Stiffened Pan- els. Francis H. K. Chen and Thomas G. Carne, Engrg. Mechanics Dept., General Motors Re- search Lab., Warren, MI. Automobile panels are stiffened in a variety of ways to meet engineering design criteria. Current example panels are numerous and include the roof, deck lid, hood, floor pan, etc. If lightweight, low modulus materials (e.g., aluminum, sheet molding compound) are to be considered for automobile panels, it can be anticipated that some form of stiffening will be necessary. In this paper, one particular type of stiffened panel, a two-layer panel consisting of a trapezoidally corrugated plate and a flat plate fastened together, is examined analytically and experimentally. A technique for modeling the panel with finite elements is developed. Rather than assigning "smeared-out" properties to the stiffeners, the fidelity of the panel is retained by modeling it as a double-layer structure (instead of as a plate) so that local deformations are also allowed. Because the method of joining significantly affects the structural properties of a stiffened panel, the two common fastening methods considered - spot-welding and epoxy-bonding, require special modeling treatment. It is shown that for a spot-welded panel, a finite element model which accounts for the effect of different spot-weld spacings can be constructed. This is achieved through the application of constraint relations between the component plates. For epoxy-bonded panels, different constraints are used. To verify these modeling procedures, both models are used in computing frequencies and mode shapes for free panel vibration, and the results are compared with experimental values. Excellent agreement was achieved with errors ranging from 2 to 8 percent for most of the modes. This investigation emphasizes the need for ade- quately representing the local deformations even when evaluating relatively simple built-up panels. 1978 SA E Transactions 780363. Pre-Processor for Finite Element Analysis and Its Application to Body Structure. Hiroshi Katoh and Hiromitsu Tahara, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. An easy-to-use pre-processor system through which finite element analysis can be applied to routine design works is needed. We have developed a general purpose pre-processor system to be used for body structures and a number of other automobile parts. It can apply to shell, beams and/or solid structures, and has functions to generate input data, to check structures by drawing and to calculate the section constants of beam elements. It has become possible to discuss the detail design of structures because we could obtain fine mesh models easily from complicated structures such as an automobile body. 780364. Dynamic Simulation of an Automobile Body Utilizing Finite Element and Modal Synthesis Techniques. Gary E. Townley and Joseph W. Klahs, Structural Dynamics Res. Corp. With the advent of high speed computers, dynamic simulation of an automobile body has become a reality. The present work will discuss methods to develop a body model of manageable size which will give good correlation with tests and can also be used as a practical design tool. The basic approach is to model each component as a separate entity and then combine the components into a system model, a "Building Block Approach." Finite element mesh considerations and modeling difficulties are discussed. An example of a vehicle body is presented to illustrate the approach. 1978 SA E Transactions 780365. Automobile Interior Noise Reduction Using Fi- nite Element Methods. Donald J. Nefske and Larry J. Howell, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Labs, Warren, MI. Low-frequency interior noise in the automobile passenger compartment can be significantly affected by the vibra- tion behavior of the body panels which surround the enclosed cavity. This paper reviews a finite element method for computing panel-excited interior noise and outlines an approach for identifying potentially noisy panels adjacent to the passenger compartment. To illustrate the potential of the analytical method, it is applied to a production automobile. A structural modi- fication suggested by the procedure is shown to signif- icantly reduce the low-frequency interior noise to which the occupant is exposed. Experimental verification of the 68</page><page sequence="52">780366 - 780372 method is presented. 1978 SA E Transactions 780366. Analysis of 30 MPH Frontal Barrier Utilizing Half-Scale Metal Models. H. A. Brownfield and D. O. Rogers, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp. A cost-effective early indicator of frontal barrier per- formance relative to government and corporate goals has been provided by half-scale metal models. These models provide direct indications of steering column kinematics and performance of specific components with respect to the windshield intrusion zone. Some indications of fuel system integrity and wind- shield retention evaluations have been inferred from half-scale model barrier tests. Model tests have provided early standard barrier data on vehicle crush modes and distances, barrier loads, and deceleration rates, in addition to generating data beyond what is available in standard barrier tests. 1978 SA E Transactions 780367. Large Displacement, Nonlinear Static and Dy- namic Analysis of Automobile Sheet Metal Structure. K. S. Yeung, IIT Research Institute; and T. Hollowell, DOT/NHTSA. A formulation is presented for the static and transient analysis of sheet metal structures involving very large displacements and rotations and elastoplastic material behavior. The geometrical nonlinearity can be treated by the decomposition of the element displacements into rigid body and deformation displacements. The elastoplastic formulation is based on the Mises yield criterion with isotropic strain hardening. The equations of motion are integrated by either the explicit or implicit schemes. Elements employed include the spring, three-dimensional beam, and plate element. Internal force or moment releases and rigid links are provided for beams. 1978 SA E Transactions 780368. Energy Absorption by the Plastic Deformation of Body Structural Members. Masanori Tani and Akio Funahashi, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Vehicle energy in head-on or rear-end collisions is mainly absorbed by the front or rear longitudinal members. This paper describes the methods of calculation of crush load and the energy absorbed during the static and dynamic crush of the sheet metal members with closed-hat section together with attached flanges or walls. Calculated results were compared with experiments including full-size automobile collisions. It is expected that the analysis considering the strain rate sensitivity will provide more accurate design information for improved automobile crash-worthiness. 780369. (SP-429) Engine Pumpability and Crankability Tests on Commercial "W" Graded Engine Oils Compared to Bench Test Results. Ross M. Stewart, Gulf Res. &amp; Dev. Co. This paper summarizes the correlations obtained between Cold Cranking Simulator viscosities and gasoline and diesel engine cranking data on 17 commercial engine oils. These engine oils include the new synthetic 5W/20 oils. The ability of an oil pumpability bench test to predict the pumpability properties of these 17 oils in a gasoline engine is also presented. The Cold Cranking Simulator Viscosities measured at temperatures from -40°F (-40°C) to 32°F (0°C) were studied to determine the necessity of measuring CCS viscosities of each "W" graded oil at its minimum expected use temperature.

Curt von Petery, Gutehoffnüngshütte Sterkrade AG, Maschinenbau Esslingen (Esslin- gen/Germany); Horst Kruse, Dept. for Refrig- eration, Hannover Technical Univ. (Hannover/ Germany); and Wilfried J. Bartz, Technische Akademie Esslingen (Ostfildern/Germany). Investigations using 4 monograde and 3 multigrade engine oils were performed by cold cranking an automotive engine to determine whether or not there is friction reduction due to the pseudoplastic behaviour of the multigrade engine oils. A comparison of the oils using viscometers indicated the viscometers' ability to predict the "engine viscosities" over a temperature and shear rate range. Furthermore, this work determined whether results of viscometric measurements could be confirmed with the test engine. An answer was found to the question of the amount of hydrodynamic friction encountered when starting an automotive engine at low temperatures. 780371. (SP-429) Energy Savings with Multigraded Die- sel Lubricants - An Experimental Test Design in Winter, Urban Bus Operation. G. R. Farnsworth and H. E. Bachman, PARAMINS Technology Div., Exxon Chemical Co.; and R. Overton, Research Dept. Imperial Oil Enterprises, Ltd. This paper illustrates how experimental design techniques can be employed to obtain an accurate assessment of multigrade Heavy Duty (HD) performance in the field. Compared to monograde (SAE 40) oil, the use of SAE 15W/40 oil was found to improve vehicle fuel mileage (MPG) as well as oil economy (MPQ). The demonstration, conducted in two groups of 10 city buses each in regular service, was structured to dampen out the effect of numerous incidental variables. Statistical data analysis indicate a "most probable" improvement in fuel mileage of 2.7% as well as a 47% increase on multigraded oil economy. 780372. (SP-429) Polymer Stability in Engines. W. Wunderlich and H. Jost, Röhm GmbH. 69</page><page sequence="53">780373 - 780377 Polymerie mineral oil additives are exposed to mechanical and thermo-oxidative degradation processes in the engine. For long lasting efficiency, they must show the highest possible stability to such attacks. The degradation proces- ses are evident from and distinguishable by the molecular weight distribution of the polymer which can be measured with great accuracy by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), even for used oils. Results of such measurements are given for various types of VI improvers (polyalkyl methacrylates, ethylene-propylene copolymers and hy- drogenated styrene-diene block copolymers) after expo- sure to Diesel and Otto engines. The influence of mechanical and thermo-oxidative degradation is discussed by means of model calculations. Comparative viscosity data elucidate the picture obtained from the distribution measurements. 780373. (SP-429) The Use of Time/Temperature Addi- tive Release Package in the Automotive Lubri- cation System. Michael R. Bethell, Paul S. Browne and Robert W. Hegel, Monroe Auto Equipment Co. A system combining an oil filter with a supplementary time/temperature additive release package has been developed which provides a non-conventional but very effective means of maintaining the viscosity level in the operating engine. Simultaneously, the system introduces certain other additives important to the engine oil performance. Studies of this system have been conducted to better understand the additive delivery rate as a function of operating conditions in the engine. This data shows that the system is generally beneficial and effective in actual field performance as well as in stationary engine test sequences. 780374. (SP-429) Temporary Viscosity Loss and Its Relationship to Journal Bearing Performance. Michael L. McMillan and Chester K. Murphy, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs. To determine the correlation between journal bearing performance and viscosity loss in a capillary, viscosities of eleven base oil-polymer blends were measured in a high-shear, pressurized capillary viscometer (High-Shear Capillary Viscometer, HSCV) at shear rates from 100 to nearly 1 000 000 s_1. Although low-shear kinematic viscosities do not predict bearing performance differences found by Rosenberg with the same oil blends, HSCV viscosities at shear rates near 500 000 s1 correlate well with the bearing performance data. Differences among polymers are strongly related to molecular weight. Discussion: M. T. O'Shaughnessy and T. W. Johnson, Phillips Petroleum Co. 1978 SA E Transactions 780375. (SP-429) Oil Viscosity at High Shear Rates Measured by a Floating Journal Bearing. M. J. DenHerder, J. W. Harnach and D. W. Wester, Amoco Oil Co. A high shear rate, 1 X lO^ec-1, viscometer uses a com- mercial tool post grinder fitted with a three-bearing internal type spindle to drive a one inch (2.54 cm) diameter journal at 10,400 rpm. A 0.0005 inch (0.00127 cm) thick fluid film between the journal and a floating bearing transfers a torque to the bearing. An oil pump built into the journal minimizes temperature and oil flow problems. Torques measured with Newtonian oils provide a torque-viscosity calibration that is used to convert torques of non-Newtonian oils to viscosities. Two bearings are used; one measures viscosities from 1.6 to 5 cp, the other, 3.4 to 10 cp. Less than one hour is required to measure an oil's viscosity over the range of either bearing at temperatures up to 370°F (188°C). This apparatus measures viscosities at the shear rate and temperatures of critical high shear sections of operating engines and hydraulic systems. The differences between ASTM D 445 kinetmatic viscosities and viscosi- ties at 1 X Wsec1 shear rate were determined for multi- graded oils formulated with a number of polymeric viscosity index improvers. At the high shear rate the percent loss of the kinematic viscosity contributed by the polymers increases as temperature decreases. 780376. (SP-429) Friction Power Loss of Mineral and Synthetic Lubricants in a Running Engine. F. L. Badiali and A. A. Cassiani Ingoni, Snampro- getti - Petroleum Products Labs (Milan/Italy); and G. Pusateri, Agip (Rome/Italy). The performance of single grade and multigrade oils and synthetic oils, has been evaluated in terms of friction power loss using an engine running on the test bed according to a modified Morse procedure. The results obtained show a good correlation between the engine performance and the rheological properties of the lubri- cants. The very low friction power loss experienced when using lubricants containing polymer can be explained by introducing the concept of anisotropic effective viscosity. Based on the good correlation between the measured and calculated friction generated in main bearings, a method has been devised for evaluating the temporary viscosity losses of multigrade oils by measuring the engine friction power loss and bearing temperatures. 780377. (SP-429) European Activity Concerning Engine Oil Viscosity Classification - Part II. C. G. A. Eberan-Eberhorst, G. F. Di Lelio and A. A. Cassiani Ingoni, Coordinating European Coun- cil. This paper is a follow-up to Part 1 of the review on European work in the field of engine oil viscosity relevant to the revision of SAE J 300 classification. The European activity covers both low and high temperature aspects and is coordinated within C.E.C., Investigation Groups IGL-8 and IGL-9 respectively. The IGL-8 activity is well under way and results have 70</page><page sequence="54">780378 - 780385 already been generated in three main areas: - the replies of the European engine builders to the SAE Questionnaire on low temperature practices and experience have indicated that there is quite a scatter in the low temperature viscometric requirements of different engines similar to that shown in the U.S.A. - the Borderline Pumping Temperatures determined with four ASTM pumpability reference oils on eight different European engines have shown a wide spectrum of engine sensitivity although the average results are similar to the data generated by ASTM. - regarding metrication of SAE J 300, European opinion expressed through the C.E.C. National organisa- tions is strongly of the opinion that the 15W grade should be incorporated into the main body of the table and that minimum viscosity values should be assigned to the W grades in order to avoid confusion. The IGL-9 work on high temperature aspects has concentrated on the viscosity measurements of seven multigrade oils in laboratory apparatus at different temperatures and rates of shear, and the results look encouraging. The next immediate step will concern engine testing of the same reference oils in an attempt to generate information on the behaviour of these lubricants in several high temperature engine performance areas. The com- pletion of this work is necessary before attempting any correlation between practical experience and oil viscosity characteristics as defined in one or more laboratory test methods. 780378.

Stewart, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co.; and Ted W. Selby, Savant, Inc. This paper was made up from the prepared discussions of the Symposium papers, author closures and pertinent discussions from the floor. The Symposium was held at the Mayo Hotel, Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 7, 1977. The six papers presented at that Symposium were collected into a bound booklet. These discussions and author closures provide a supplement to SAE SP 419 and ASTM STP 621 -SI. 780380. Testimony Concerning Human Fault Concepts. Frank D. Fowler, Fowler, Fuehrer and Asso- ciates, Inc., Orlando, FL. The design engineer must be aware of two sources of human error. First are those which he may commit during the design process. Second are those that the potential user may commit when he attempts to use the product. When called as a witness to defend his design decisions in a product liability suit, the design engineer must be able to show that both concepts of human fault were considered as part of the design process. Additionally, it is essential that he be familiar with methods of preventing these human errors. 1978 SAE Transactions 780381. Products Liability - Bringing the Interaction of Society and Technology into Engineering Edu- cation. James F. Thorpe, Univ. of Cincinnati. The Products Liability crisis has an impact on engineering education through the teaching of design courses and, increasingly, through faculty consulting work. This crisis may be only temporary, while legislative reform occurs, but it raises broader questions of the interaction between society and technology and of engineering and the law. This paper reviews the broadening perspective in engi- neering education from the standpoint of traditional engineering education, design engineering education, and guidelines for professional practice. Also, the present status of the involvement of Products Liability in engineering education is surveyed. 1978 SAE Transactions 780383. Surface Transportation Noise - The Role of the U.S. Department of Transportation. W. H. Close, Office of Noise Abatement, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, D.C. The U.S. Department of Transportation plays a variety of roles in the area of surface transportation noise abatement and control. This paper outlines these roles through a discussion of the research, development, and demon- stration programs and accomplishments of the various Departmental organizations, including: The Federal Highway Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Railroad Adminis- tration, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation. 780384. Motor Vehicle Noise Control Legislation in Australia. R. Snow and R. Law, Noise Control Branch, Environment Protection Authority (Australia). The preparation of objective legislation to control noise from motor vehicles is well advanced in Australia and enforcement has commenced in some Australian States. A design rule setting criteria for noise emissions from new vehicles was published by the Federal Department of Transport in 1972 and a revised design rule reducing the maximum permissible levels was finalized in 1976 but its implementation has been deferred. Following extensive surveys, regulations setting criteria for in-service vehicles have been prepared by the Environment Protection Authority in Victoria and it is anticipated that these criteria will be adopted by all States in Australia. 780385.

An assessment of the effectiveness 71</page><page sequence="55">780386 - 780393 of current regulations is made in general terms and possible future regulatory actions are discussed. The need for co-ordination of federal regulation of the new vehicle and provincial or municipal regulation of the vehicle in use is emphasized with particular reference to the importance of voluntary standardization in the current situation in Canada. 780386. Progress in the Reduction of Noise from Road Transport in the United Kingdom. Rupert Taylor, Rupert Taylor &amp; Partners Ltd. (England). Noise from road transport in the United Kingdom has been a subject of three separate initiatives originated or supported by central government. Progress achieved by means of 1) compensation, sound insulation and planning controls; 2) research and development of quiet heavy goods vehicles; 3) a quiet town experiment, is discussed. The over-all cost and effect of the three parallel programmes is assessed along with indications for future policy. 780387. Measurement of Truck and Vehicle Noise. Malcolm J. Crocker and Joseph W. Sullivan, Ray W. Herrick Labs, School of Mechanical Engrg., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN. This paper reviews general methods of identifying noise sources in machinery and in particular it describes in detail two methods which have been studied by the authors on a truck: near field measurements and the coherence technique. The results of these two methods are compared with results of a third method in which the same truck with different sources wrapped and then sequentially exposed was driven past a microphone using the SAE J366b test. The paper also reviews two different stationary indoor standard tests which have been investigated: the reduced drive-by simulation method , and the sound power method. These tests could be used to supplement (or replace) the standard SAE J366b drive-by test in some cases. Com- parisons are made of data from the two tests developed and the SAE J366b drive-by data for the same truck. 1978 SAE Transactions 780388. Noise Prediction of Heavy Vehicles in Non- Uniform Traffic Flow. C. Sparkes and J. B. Large, Institute of Sound and Vibration Re- search, Univ. of Southampton (England). A technique has been developed to predict the noise generated by queues of vehicles accelerating directly across a controlled intersection, and comparisons have been made with field measurements. Noise profiles and motion characteristics have been obtained for decelerating vehicles at a controlled intersection, and a computer simulation model has been developed to investigate the effect of sampling rate in the statistical analysis of the noise generated by accelerating heavy vehicles. 1978 SAE Transactions 780389.

This paper describes a continuing research program on traffic noise annoyance that is being conducted by the Societal Analysis Department at the General Motors Research Laboratories. The work involves a combination of laboratory, field, and computer modeling studies. Results are intended to provide a better fundamental understanding of noise-induced annoyance. Potential applications include the evaluation of various vehicle noise reduction programs. 1978 SAE Transactions 780391. A Tensile Strip Test for Evaluating Friction in Sheet Metal Forming. J. L. Duncan, McMaster Univ. (Canada); B. S. Shabel, Alcoa Lab.; and J. Gerbase Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul-Brazil. A tensile strip test has been developed for evaluating friction under conditions which simulate the stretching of sheet over the punch corner radius in forming a shallow stamping in a typical draw die. Preliminary results are presented for the aluminum alloys 5182-0, 2036-T4, 6009-T4 and 6010-T4, which are used for automotive applications. Tests were conducted with various lubri- cation conditions, different corner radii and with prestrained sheet. For given friction conditions, the maximum strain obtained over the face of the punch was significantly affected by small amounts of prestrain or small changes in the tensile/yield ratio of the sheet. 780392. Interrelation Between Part and Die Design for Aluminum Auto Body Panels. N. P. Wolff, Aluminum Co. of America. Guidelines for forming aluminum auto body panels have been developed for use by part and forming tool designers.

Typical panel applications for four aluminum auto body sheet alloys are discussed. 780393. Tooling Methods for Extruding Holes in Alu- minum Auto Body Sheet. Marvin H. Williams, Aluminum Company of America. 72</page><page sequence="56">780394 - 780400 A new tooling technique has been developed to fabricate substantially longer split free collars than were previously possible in aluminum body sheet alloy. This technique is economical and can often be incorporated into existing tooling.

Assessment of Lubricants for Aluminum Forming. Harmon D. Nine, Physics Dept., General Mo- tors Research Labs, Warren, MI. A test has been devised by which lubricants for sheet metal forming may be assessed for their lubrication capability and their effect on galling. An apparatus was constructed which simulates drawbeads, a mechanism which controls sheet metal flow into a die. The load to draw sheet metal through the simulated drawbeads varies for different lubricants. Comparison to the load for a standard lubricant gives a lubricity rating. Lubricants are also rated for their effect on galling. The lubricity rating obtained by this laboratory method correlates with the performance of the lubricants in production runs. 780396. Joining of Aluminum Alloys 6009/6010. F. R. Hoch, Aluminum Company of America. The interest in aluminum alloys and aluminum joining in the automotive industry has increased considerably over the past few years as a result of new fuel economy, air pollution and safety requirements. Aluminum is the best alternative to steel to make lighter and more fuel-efficient automobiles. Several aluminum alloys have been consid- ered for body sheet components. The new Alcoa 6009-T4 and 6010-T4 alloys were developed and introduced in 1976 to increase the attractiveness of aluminum for body sheet components. These alloys have good formability in the as-received condition and superior strength and dent resistance in the aged (-T6) condition which can be achieved in paint bake cycles. These alloys are similar in composition and do not require scrap segregation. In addition, the 6009/6010 alloys provide improved welding characteristics through a combination of better metal- lurgical characteristics and lower and more uniform surface resistance. This paper discusses the metallurgical factors and surface conditions which make these new alloys better performers. It also discusses applicable joining methods, procedures and the test results obtained. 1978 SA E Transactions 780397. Fatigue Performance of Aluminum Joints for Automotive Applications. G. E. Nordmark, Alu- minum Company of America. Fatigue tests have been conducted to evaluate several methods of joining aluminum sheet for automotive applications: resistance spot welds; GM A spot welds; fillet welds; rivets; mechanical clinching; bonding; and, combinations of bonding with spot welding, riveting, and clinching. Spot welded, riveted or clinched lap joints in 1.0 mm (0.040 in.) aluminum have fatigue strengths 1/2 to 2/3 those of spot welded joints in 0.8 mm (0.032 in.) steel. Bonding in combination with these joining techniques produces joints having fatigue strengths equal to or higher than those of spot welded steel joints. Simulated service exposures generally reduce long-life fatigue strength of combination joints. 1978 SA E Transactions 780398. Hailstone Response of Body Panels - Real and Simulated. Bernard A. Niemeier and Carlton E. Burley, Reynolds Metals Co. The dent resistance of aluminum and steel autobody panels has been studied under controlled laboratory conditions and by field observations and measurements of actual hailstone damage. Analysis of the results shows that very nearly the same response occurred in the lighter weight aluminum components as occurred in the steel panels. The autobody components were all 1977 model year production panels. Laboratory testing included four steel and four aluminum hoods, both painted and unpainted. The hailstone damaged components included a steel hood, aluminum doors and an aluminum fender. The aluminum and steel panels were damaged in the same hailstorm during May 1977. The analysis of denting resistance presented in this paper is based on insight and experience gained from a four-year cooperative program of Reynolds Research and several automobile companies. The results given here supplement previously published laboratory data and confirm the conclusion that lighter weight aluminum autobody panels can be designed to give at least comparable, if not better, dent resistance than convention- ally used steel panels, and at a weight savings of 50 percent. 780399. In-Plant and After-Market Repair of Aluminum Auto Body Sheet. M. A. Glagola and R. A. Morley, Reynolds Metals Co. This paper discusses the technique and problems asso- ciated with in-plant and body shop repair of aluminum auto body sheet. Metallic and nonmetallic repair pro- cedures are discussed for in-plant repair of aluminum auto body sheet. An after-market procedure for repair of aluminum sheet is also presented, as well as a new procedure for arc welding of thin gauge aluminum sheet for in-plant and after-market repair. 780400. Seal Size - Its Effects on Radial Lip-Type Oil Seal Design. James D. Symons, General Motors Research Labs. A fractional factorial experimental study was conducted to determine the effect of seal size on seal design. The seven factors studied were inside lip diameter (w/o spring), seal size, shaft-to-bore offset, spring position, contact width, flex section thickness, and material 73</page><page sequence="57">780401 - 780407 modulus. The fractional factorial experiment was de- signed so all interactions involving seal size were deter- minable. Leakage was measured as the response or dependent variable. The large seal (nominal 100 mm) differed from the small seal (nominal 50 mm) in three areas: (1) shaft-to-bore offset was not tolerated by the large seal, (2) the spring position was required to be closer to the contact line with the large seal, and (3) a higher material modulus was necessary with the larger seal. 780401. Sealing Considerations for Tapered Roller Bear- ings. Dennis Lee Otto, The Timken Co. This paper discusses the application of seals to tapered roller bearings and is intended as a guide to (1) the engineer designing a sealed application, (2) the production personnel installing seals in the application and (3) the maintenance personnel servicing the application. The paper is deliberately not referenced so that when problems are encountered that cannot be solved by using this guide, the bearing or seal manufacturer is consulted. 780402. Evaluating Dust Exclusion for Rotating Shaft Seal Applications. L. A. Horve, CR Industries. Elastomeric radial lip seals are designed to retain lubricants and exclude contaminants. Dual lip designs have evolved to achieve these goals. A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a given dual lip design. Comparisons were made to a single lip design. Under the given test conditions, the single lip design outper- formed the dual lip design. 780403. Ethylene/Acrylic Elastomers - New Candidates for Sealing Applications. John Carr and Arthur Ginn, International Packings Corp., Bristol, NH. Ethylene/acrylic elastomers are new candidate materials for challenging automotive sealing problem areas. They promise attractive blends of thermal stability, oil and weather resistance, mechanical properties and low tem- perature performance for service formerly restricted to the more expensive high temperature silicone and fluoro- carbon elastomers. Our preliminary research and devel- opment on specific automotive sealing applications has produced data that enables us to position ethylene/acrylic elastomers in relationship with the other commercial seal materials. Revealed are the results of our chemical, material and ongoing field testing programs which are helping us predict the future of ethylene/acrylic elasto- mers as viable solutions to critical sealing problems. 780404. Guide to Automotive Water Pump Seals. Akira Matsushima, NOK-USA, Inc. A new SAE Recommended Practice for automotive water pump seals has been proposed through committee work. The existing standards, specifications and other publi- cations have been reviewed to find practical information on the design and use of water pump face seals. The paper presents the committee's recommendations on types of seals and materials, design data, and qualification and inspection information. The paper also describes test methods, equipment, and system orientations for evalu- ating seal performance. 1978 SAE Transactions 780405. Effect of Surface Condition of Lip on Sealing Phenomena of Oil Seals. Yoshio Kawahara, Masato Abe and Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Akira Matsushima, NOK-USA, Inc. It becomes clear that the suction coefficient of oil, K, and the sealing characteristic constant, &lt;ř ( = fG_1/3), are closely connected with the rubbing surface state of oil seals. And, investigations have done on K-, 4&gt;-value, etc. in oil seals after the practical use in automobiles and the results have been compared with the test results in the laboratory. 780406. Effect of Quantity of Lubricating Oil on Sealing Characteristics of Oil Seals. Hiroshi Hirabaya- shi, Tatsuaki Yukimasa and Kazuo Uchino, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Hiroshi Yamaguchi, NOK-USA, Inc. (U.S.A.). For purpose of clarifying the effect of quantity of lubricating oil supplied to the seal lip portion on sealing characteristics of oil seals, relations between the typical constructional applications of the fitting portion for oil seals and the quantity of the lubricating oil supplied to the oil seals are discussed. Then the necessary minimum quantity of the lubri- cating oil for preventing the seal lip from wear is investigated. And it is clarified that the decrease in sealing characteristics occurs when the lubricating oil is supplied insufficiently to the seal lip portion and, finally, the countermeasure is discussed. 780407. A Practical Approach to Cab Suspension. R. Wild, Seddon Atkinson Vehicles Ltd. As a result of the introduction of the modern tilt cab, suspension designs are required to be more sophisticated in order to provide the ride quality expected from a modern truck. The purpose of the study undertaken was to determine practical methods and the respective considerations and decisions required to mount a cab to various chassis constructions. The basis of this exercise was a European type truck of cab over configuration. Various stages in the concept are highlighted in addition to relative decisions and required considerations. Because measurable standards exist on ride quality, this aspect was studied briefly due to the fact that generally required comfort standards vary a great deal between countries. The final objective was to determine the cab structural damage incurred through the cab suspension, and to determine projected vehicle mileages on various highways before structural damage is caused. 74</page><page sequence="58">780408-780416 780408. A Heavy Truck Cab Suspension for Improved Ride. Albert W. Foster, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents a simplified concept of the cab- over-engine tractor ride problem. It discusses ways ride can be improved and the reasons cab suspension was chosen as the preferred solution.

A Cab Suspension for Transcontinental Opera- tion. A. A. Selman and T. A. H. Pixton, Ford Motor Co., Ltd. (England). This paper outlines the reasons for the design of a heavy duty truck having a sophisticated cab suspension system, to cater for the special conditions of transeuropean operation. It describes the design and development of the Ford Transcontinental cab suspension, and the resulting ride performance. The unique cab tilt system used in conjunction with the cab suspension is also described. 780411. Analytical and Subjective Ride Quality Compar- ison of Front and Rear Cab Isolation Systems on A COE Tractor. Wallace Flower, Lord Kine- matics Div., Lord Corp. Instrumented and subjective cab ride quality data is obtained for a COE tractor/trailer combination in which two different cab isolation systems were installed. In the first system, the rear of the cab is suspended on soft springs while the front is pinned to the frame, allowing cab pitch only. In the second system, the rear of the cab is pinned to the frame while the front is suspended on soft springs. The relative performance of these two systems is compared. Results are compared with predictions of a multi degree of freedom tractor/trailer computer model. 1978 SA E Transactions 780412. Development of a 5.7 Litre V8 Automotive Diesel Engine. J. H. Jones, W. L. Kingsbury, H. H. Lyon, P. R. Mutty and K. W. Thurston, Oldsmobile Division GMC. During 1973, Oldsmobile planners concluded there would be a need for an engine with good emission capability and excellent fuel economy. After a study of alternate engines, they concluded that a diesel based on the Oldsmobile 350 gasoline engine would be the best answer. This paper reviews in detail: early diesel investigations conducted, combustion chamber development work leading to the General Motors 5.7 litre diesel, details of the production engine and modifications required to install it in the Oldsmobile passenger car. The final section reviews the future potential for diesels in the United States. 1978 SA E Transactions 780413. BUICK'S Turbocharged V-6 Powertrain for 1978. T. F. Wallace, Buick Motor Division, General Motors Corporation. A new turbocharged 3.8 litre V-6 engine and powertrain has been developed for production application in the Buick model line-up. This design offers, as a replacement for larger displacement engines, a turbocharged powertrain with improved fuel economy and equal performance. Signif- icant technological advances include engine-turbo match- ing for improved low end and mid-range performance, minimizing turbo vehicle "lag", and an all new electronic spark control closed loop system that controls detonation through the use of spark retard. Revisions of basic engine components to ensure durability and pleaseability equiv- alent to that of a conventional engine are discussed. Further development of this powertrain concept may provide the flexibility to meet legislated fuel economy levels of the future without severe compromises in vehicle size or performance. 1978 SA E Transactions 780414. A Comparison of Advanced Belt Systems Re- garding Their Effectiveness. Rüdiger Weissner, Research and Development, Volkswagen werk AG. Belt systems are an appropriate means for realizing effective occupant protection. There are technical pos- sibilities known, e.g. belt force limiters and preloading devices, which permit extreme safety requirements to be fulfilled by means of purposive coordination of the belt system to the structural deformation behaviour. The results presented here provide an example. It is at present difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of an occupant restraint system. One reason among others is the lack of an uniform complex Evaluation Index. In this paper, a suggestion is made concerning this problem: Introduction of the Evaluation Index EI. 780415. Matching Case Methodology for Measuring Re- straint Effectiveness. H. D. Pursei, R. W. Bryant and J. W. Scheel, General Motors Proving Ground; and A. J. Yanik, GM Technical Center. This paper describes a procedure used to evaluate the injury and fatality prevention effectiveness of automobile occupant restraint systems using field accident data. The technique involves the direct comparison of accidents involving a specific restraint with a control group of accidents with similar injury producing potential. This technique is called the Matching Case Methodology and has been initially applied by General Motors in deter- mining air cushion effectiveness. 1978 SA E Transactions 780416. Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of Wankel Engine Performance. Guido A. Danieli, Diparti- mento di Meccanice, Universita degli Studi della Calabria Arcavacata di Rende (Cosenza); James C. Keck and John B. Heywood, Mechanical 75</page><page sequence="59">780417-780424 Engrg. Dept., Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology, Cambridge, MA. A model for predicting the performance and emissions characteristics of Wankel engines has been developed and tested. Each chamber is treated as an open thermody- namic system and the effects of turbulent flame propa- gation, quench layer formation, gas motion, heat transfer and seal leakage are included. The experimental tests were carried out on a Toyo Kogyo 12B engine under both motoring and firing conditions and values for the effective seal leakage area and turbulent heat transfer coefficient were deduced. The agreement between the predicted and measured performances was reasonable. Parametric stud- ies of the effects of reductions in seal leakage and heat transfer were carried out and the results are presented. 780417. Development on Exhaust Emissions and Fuel Economy of the Rotary Engine at Toyo Kogyo. Kenichi Yamamoto and Takumi Muroki, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Japan). The fuel economy was sharply improved from our 1976 model rotary engine cars mainly through modifications to the engine and improvements in the reactivity of the thermal reactor system. The progress of our development on these items of improvement and their effects are presented in this paper. Our advance program includes several development items in addition to the above, and the progress of development on these items and their future prospects are also presented. 780418. An Update of the Development on the New Audi NSU Rotary Engine Generation. Richard van Basshuysen and Gottlieb Wilmers, Audi NSU Auto Union A.G. (Germany). At AUDI NSU a new generation of rotary engines has been developed of which the significant layout parameters are outlined. The present status of development is characterized by a lean burn concept with fuel injection and an exhaust emission control system with catalytic converter. Test results indicate that the fuel economy ranges at the same level as comparable reciprocating engines. The future US-exhaust emission standards are kept below but in respect to the Japanese standards further reduction of NOx is necessary. Endurance tests proving the durability of the exhaust emission control system have still to be performed. 780419. Sources of Hydrocarbon Emissions in Rotary Engines. Harvey A. Burley, Michael R. Meloeny and Terrence L. Stark, Advance Prod- uct Engrg., General Motors Corp. In many rotary engines, over 10% of the fuel passes through the engine unused. This loss makes exhaust cleanup difficult and also represents a serious penalty in fuel economy. The major hydrocarbon sources were found to be apex seal leakage, cold wall zone effects, residuals and surface-to-volume ratio which included rotor surface quench and chamber surface quench. Lesser hydrocarbon sources were crevice volume, and effects attributable to spark plug, ignition system, turbulence, intake mixture and lubricant on the combustion chamber walls. Through various engine modifications we were able to cut base engine hydrocarbons about 55%. 1978 SA E Transactions 780421. A Pulsating Cushion That Improves Lower Body Hemodynamics of Seated Individuals. Leslie D. Montgomery and Edmund J. Glassford, LDM Associates, San Jose, CA. Impedance Plethysmography was used to measure the perfusion changes and venous clearance in the lower leg, knee, thigh and buttock that was produced by operation of a pulsating seat cushion that may reduce the detri- mental hemodynamic effects of prolonged driving. The grouped mean indices of arterial perfusion increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), in all segments studied, following a 5 minute activation of the seat cushion. The cushion assisted venous clearance in all segments of the leg during each inflation cycle. This device may be desirable to- reduce fatigue and increase performance during pro- longed driving. 780423. High Performance Cars Demand High Perform- ance Materials. Kurt H. Miska, Materials Engrg. Magazine. High performance road and racing cars demand high performance from materials. Because high performance must be coupled with reliability, most constructors of such cars take a very conservative approach to materials selection, but some boldly break ground by using more advanced materials. Aluminum, magnesium and alloy steel are the most commonly used materials. Titanium, plastics and advanced composites are used by the more imaginative constructors. Here is a survey of materials specified by some of the builders of high performance road and racing cars. 780424. The Fiesta-Concept of an Economical Vehicle. Jürgen Aigner and Fred Franz, European Au- tomotive Operations, Ford Motor Co. (West Germany). The FIESTA, announced in July 1976, extends the European Ford model range by adding a new vehicle in the sub-compact class. The development of the FIESTA, to suit the market in North America and to comply with the motor vehicle safety standards of the United States and Canada, was completed in early 1977. The car was presented to the US public in May of that year. In part one of this paper the European version is described with special reference to those innovations which are of most interest in Europe. Part two deals with the North American version of the FIESTA with its specific requirements for comfort and conformity to safety regulations. 76</page><page sequence="60">780425 - 780433 780425. The Octane Requirement Trends of European and Japanese Cars. A. P. Armstrong, The British Petroleum Co. Ltd., BP Research Centre (England). The paper outlines the OR trends of European and Japanese cars found in the European market place over the last five years. The consistently high proportion of critical models (at the 98 RON European Premium grade level) is highlighted, possibly reflecting the consequences of exhaust emissions and economy tuning brought about under the influence of tightening European legislation. However, the significant number of cars suffering from ignition over-advance is also investigated, this aspect being felt to be of increasing relevance. Whilst the importance of front end octane number as a gasoline parameter is shown to be declining slowly, the continuing large number of vehicles conscious, to a slightly increasing extent, of high sensitivity and/or olefin content is emphasized. Finally, the deleterious effect of lowering lead con- centration is clearly demonstrated, particularly under the high engine speed conditions commonly encountered by small-engined European vehicles. 780426. Diesel Engines and Their Particle Signatures. Gordon L. Scofield, 1977 SAE President. New instruments and techniques have made it possible to study particle morphology and composition to an extent not previously possible. The particulates in exhaust emissions and the particles resulting from engine wear are the two examples discussed in this presentation. In order to identify physical and chemical charac- teristics of diesel engine exhaust particulates, specialized sampling and analytical methods are required. Some of the techniques and instrumentation are presented along with typical results of exhaust particulate analysis. The particles of wear contained in engine lubricating oil provide information about wear mechanisms by utilizing new methods of analysis. The preparation of samples and the use of ferrography and scanning electron microscopy to analyze particle characteristics are illus- trated as specific examples of wear analysis. This lecture is based on the work of Dr. John H. Johnson and several graduate students at Michigan Technological University. Their work and help is grate- fully acknowledged. 1978 SAE Transactions 780429. Accident Reconstruction in Urban Areas. Jack D. Baird, John Didion and Raymond J. Hughes, Dynamic Science, Inc. An urban area is an excellent laboratory to conduct vehicle accident investigations. The central city of Los Angeles, California and the entire city of Miami, Florida, will be the geographical areas discussed. These areas experience a large number of accidents in a relatively small geographical region and contain diverse numbers and types of vehicles, collision configurations, and accident severity levels, Figure 1. Within the designated urban area, the Accident Investigation (AI) team main- tains close cooperation with all law enforcement agencies, along with many other federal, state and local agencies. 780430.

Extensive laboratory and field testing was conducted in developing the various speci- fications and component configurations required to assure satisfactory performance and durability. 780431. Improving Serviceability. Daniel W. Patton, Cummins Engine Company, Inc. Rising costs have increased the need for simplifying service. The response at Cummins Engine Company has been a program to improve the serviceability of engines, plus an effort to help equipment manufacturers make engines more serviceable in their installations. The program is a cooperative effort among several areas. Design criteria for improved engine serviceability are discussed. Key maintenance and repair operations are used as the basis of measuring and comparing the serviceability of engines. The method presented is flexible enough to allow various trade-offs to be made during the design stage. Guidelines for improved installation serviceability are outlined. The guidelines establish time limits for daily checks and routine maintenance, plus targets for service repairs. These are based on the times to perform the respective operations on free standing engines with allowances for installation considerations. 780432. A Simple Bench Engine Test for the Evaluation of the Anti-Scuffing Properties of Automotive En- gine Lubricants. A. A. Cassiani Ingoni and M. G. Miorali, Agip Petroleum Products Lab., Snamprogetti (Milan/Italy). The present trend in the formulation of automotive engine lubricants is towards low viscosity products as to minimise the power loss due to viscous drag. Consequently, the engines may be exposed to adhesive wear, and in particular to scuffing of the cylinder-piston assembly. A tightening bench test has been developed using a two-stroke engine which is able to assess the anti-scuffing protection of automotive engine lubricants. Several types of lubricants have been evaluated: mineral oils, polyglycols, esters, polybutenes, alkylates, white oils. 1978 SAE Transactions 780433. Automotive Control Development System. T. R. 77</page><page sequence="61">780434-780450 Schlax and J. T. Auman, Advance Product Engrg., General Motors Technical Center, War- ren, MI. As the number of automotive control applications has increased, a need has arisen for a development system. This development system must allow the automotive engineer who is unfamiliar with electronic and computer technologies to conceive and evaluate control algorithm concepts with a minimum of design effort. Some basic interactive functions, which are common to most devel- opment efforts, should be incorporated into this unit. These interactive elements include a keyboard, display, and printer. The development system described in this paper provides a simplified means of program debugging, the capability to modify data and program functions during operation and evaluation, and the capability to accu- mulate and store evaluation data. The equipment asso- ciated with this development system is divided into two portions. One portion controls the vehicle operation and interfaces with the automotive sensors and actuators. The other portion controls the operator interface devices which include the keyboard, display, printer, and other peripheral units. The vehicle equipment has been designed to operate on vehicle battery power. After the control algorithm has been determined using the development system, the contents of the system memory can be transferred to a ROM device for the production automotive controller. Therefore the system is useful in all phases of product development from the initial concept stage to production. 780434. Design Considerations in Energy Absorption by Structural Collapse. C. L. Magee and P. H. Thornton, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A general treatment of the absorption of mechanical energy by the axial collapse of a variety of structural shapes, including tubes, honeycombs and foams is developed which encompasses both the geometry of the structure and also the material properties. The use of the method in the design of load bearing structures in which energy absorption is an additional design function is illustrated. High strength-to-weight ratio materials offer a significant weight saving for energy absorbing compo- nents, although such materials may have a reduced tensile ductility. The implications to situations in vehicle crash- worthiness are discussed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780435. Pulse Modulation A/D Converter. Thomas P.

Pisarski, Schwitzer, Wallace Murray Corp. Cooling system fan noise reduction can be best achieved by a combination of aerodynamic design and control of the fan environment. Design for minimum noise is a complex procedure that requires the optimization of fan geometry and fan environment, maximum efficiency at the operating point and the lowest possible blade tip speed. Good noise measurements are essential to research and development activities in fan noise reduction. Com- puter aided design techniques are required to optimize the fan. 780457. Gaseous Automotive Fuels from Steam Reformed Liquid Hydrocarbons. Marvin D. Martin, Aer- ospace and Mechanical Engrg. Dept., Univ. of Arizona. A system is proposed for producing a mixture of hydrogen and methane for automotive fuel by steam reforming gasoline.

The results of a computer model of the system are given and a verifying experimental program described. 780458. Advanced Batteries for Vehicle Propulsion. Leslie Burris and Paul A. Nelson, Argonne National Laboratory, Chemical Engineering Div., Ar- gonne, IL. This paper discusses the development of batteries for electric vehicles, the performance goals for the batteries, and the strategy being followed in the U.S. to promote commercialization of electric vehicles. Supported by the government, intensive development of several near-term and advanced rechargeable batteries that are projected to meet performance and cost requirements for electric vehicles is underway. Of the potential near-term batteries, lead-acid, iron-nickel oxide, and zinc-nickel oxide are the most promising for use in vehicles with limited range and applications. Much better performance is expected from second generation batteries, which include lithium-alu- minum/metal sulfides, zinc/chlorine, and sodium/sulfur batteries. Successful development of electric vehicles will help conserve the world's resources of petroleum by shifting the energy source to coal and nuclear. 1978 SA E Transactions 780459. Methanol and Other Alternative Fuels for Off- Highway Mobile Engines. E. Eugene Ecklund, U.S. Department of Energy. Considerable insight into alternatives to petroleum as fuels for earthmoving and other off-highway vehicles can be gained from investigations related to highway vehicles. At the same time, off-highway equipment has the potential of greater flexibility in choice of fuels because of simpler fuel logistics. Uncertainties in both petroleum resources and alternative supplies are reviewed, and implications for the remainder of this century are highlighted. However, technology to make alcohols is well established and a multiplicity of resources is available. Thus, the technical benefits and problems of using alcohols as a petroleum extender or substitute are detailed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780462. The Development of a Scraper Suspension Sys- tem.

Efficiency characteristics are considered of simple control types (constant pressure and constant power) applied to a variable displacement pump as single unit or in connec- tion with a fixed displacement motor or a dummy actuator (having efficiency features of a transmission line). The most efficient way to implement a specific control is identified in terms of speed and displacement, while basic control parameters result from the optimization of maximum or mean efficiency. Some effects of controls on driving engine fuel consumption and sizing are also discussed. Computations are based on efficiency models devised by authors as approximation of a number (sometimes large) of reference data, and carried out with an original Non-Linear Programming code (FALL77). 1978 SA E Transactions 780466. Hydrostatics and Planetary Gearing - A Syner- gistic Approach. Howard J. Sculthorpe and Robert E. Lemon, Sperry Vickers Division, Sperry Rand Corp. A combination of hydrostatics and planetary gearing has proven to be a synergistic mating of two basic modes of power transmission in mobile applications. This paper reviews this combination, particularly as applied to track drives for the earthmoving and construction industries. 780468. Underspoil Coal Haulage. Guy A. Johnson, U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Twin Cities Mining Research Center. To evaluate the feasibility of an alternative to the costly construction and reclamation of haulage roads in surface coal mines, the Bureau of Mines contracted with the Dravo Corp., Denver, Colo., to conduct an engineering and economic evaluation of the haulage of coal out of the strip pit via conveyors running in culverts laid under the advancing spoil. The results of this study, which are presented in this paper, discuss the cost savings, plus the more subtle advantages and disadvantages of this novel haulage system in a number of alternative strip coal mine designs. The Bureau's plans for a demonstration of a prototype underspoil coal haulage system are also out- lined. 780469. Rail Haulage of Waste Rock and Crude Ore. Robert J. Ward, DIFCO, Inc. A presentation of present rail haulage practices in open pit mining. Description of car types, sizes, and their application for various haulage jobs, car construction practices and air braking data are presented. Loading and unloading methods for various car types are illustrated. Job matching the locomotive with an eye toward fuel economy, including a review of basic transportation formulas. 780471. A Method for the Prediction of Noise Levels at Construction Site Boundaries. Shing-ichi Hongo, Construction Method and Machinery Research Institute. Prior to starting construction work in Japan, it recently has become necessary to predict the noise pollution level caused by construction equipment at the job site bound- aries. This led to the development of a simple, inexpensive but relatively precise computer program and method for noise prediction. Input for the computer program requires measurement of the noise level of each machine used on the construc- tion project. Accuracy of the method has been experimentally verified by actual field tests. 780472. An Analytical Model for Exhaust System Design. L. J. Eriksson, Nelson Industries, Inc., Stough- ton, WI. An analytical model has been developed that provides a valuable addition to the tools available for practical exhaust system design. Correlation with experimental results has been improved by including the effects of such factors as temperature gradients, complex elements, higher order modes, and source impedance. The model can be used for specific design problems as well as general parameter studies to maximize exhaust system attenuation within a given volume. 1978 SA E Transactions 780474. Development of a Suspension Seat for Earth- moving Vehicles. L. John Koutsky, Sears Man- ufacturing Co. A suspension seat has been developed for earthmoving and other off-highway vehicles, following specific guide- lines established by the manufacturers of such vehicles. A wide range of adjustments is provided to properly position the operator relative to the various vehicle controls. 80</page><page sequence="64">780477 -780485 Several new ideas are employed, such as a fore-aft slide with self-cleaning rollers, a mechanical suspension spring system which provides air spring characteristics, and a seat/suspension package which will meet the SAE recommended practice for seat belt attachment strength without the need for additional tether belts. 780477. Earthmoving Machine Service Problems. C. E. Sanders, Green Construction Co. Earthmoving equipment manufacturers need to concen- trate on machine service related problems which have been identified in the past ten years. These service problems are grouped into routine maintenance, design, safety equipment, component reliability, tires and export machine problems. Specific requirements are outlined and recommended design objectives are identified. The con- clusion is equipment manufacturers need to concentrate on designing machines that reduce service and main- tenance cost as well as provide simplicity of operation and maintenance while simplification for utilization in export markets is a common requirement. 780478. Earthmoving Tools for Tomorrow's Work. Gary J. Thomas, S. J. Groves &amp; Sons Co. A large contractor expresses his feelings and some facts on the type of machinery the industry is producing today.

The quality of a product is as perceived by the user and includes the net effect of the quality of the original product and of available product support. Engineering objectives should include improvement of support capa- bilities, regardless of the exquisiteness of the design. 780480. An Overview of Mechanical Tunneling Machines and Techniques for Soft Ground. Roger J. Morrell, U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Twin Cities Mining Research Center. This paper presents an overview of the tools and techniques used in soft-ground tunneling. The history of mechanized soft-ground tunneling is reviewed to describe the major advances leading to the development of the modern tunneling machine. Major subsystems of modern machine boring are then described in some detail, including excavation, support, and materials handling. The paper concludes with a summary of the current state-of-the-art of mechanical boring, followed by a look at near-term innovations and their impact on future machine boring. 1978 SAE Transactions 780481. Tunnel Boring a Mine Slope. Walter E. Bullers, Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Co., Indiana, PA. Tunneling with a boring machine has been used exten- sively in the construction industry but has been virtually ignored by the mining industry. Looking for a faster and more economical way of constructing a mine slope, the Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Company turned to a tunnel boring machine to replace the former drilling and shooting method. The results of this decision and the construction of two coal mine slopes are discussed in this paper. 780482. Soft Ground Tunnel Boring Machines. Carl W. Decker, Carl W. Decker, Inc. Environmental Controls, Transportation, Congested Liv- ing and Utility Requirements have necessitated that Engineers seriously consider underground installation as a solution. The advent of the Tunnel Boring Machine make these installations economically feasible. 780484. A Practical Approach to Designing Four-Bar Linkages for Guiding Rigid Bodies. Dilworth D. Lyman, John Deere Dubuque Works. A computer program has been written to help in the synthesis of four-bar linkages. With the input of the required four positions of a guided body, the computer solves for a very large number of the solutions and simplifies the user's search for the "best" four-bar linkage. The computer then examines this linkage for range of travel and discontinuities throughout this range. The program can also calculate the transmission angle range and classify the type of motion. If a graphics display is available, the linkage can be displayed and animated. The program is written with conversational input and output, including optional instructions for new users. 1978 SAE Transactions 780485. Field Testing of "Reference Vehicles" as an Aid to the Design Analysis Process for Earthmoving Equipment. Jack W. Martz, R. Gene Smiley and Joseph G. Kormos, Structural Dynamics Re- search Corp. New design analysis methods for the structural devel- opment and evaluation of earthmoving equipment have been heavily utilized in recent years. In particular, this increased utilization has focused on the use of finite element methods for analyzing stresses in structural components and the use of combined experimental/an- alytical modeling techniques, such as the "Building Block Approach," for studying the system response of complete vehicles. The presence of these predictive methods has placed a new burden on test activities which support vehicle design and analysis. Properly planned tests on "reference vehicles," i.e., existing vehicles for which new designs are needed, can play an important role in directing the new vehicle design efforts. This paper will discuss automated methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and han- dling data for effectively supporting design analysis needs. An example is given to demonstrate the integration of various capabilities into a total approach to new structural development. In addition, a discussion on future direc- 81</page><page sequence="65">780486-780513 tions of this technology is included. 1978 SA E Transactions 780486. ADAMS2: A Sparse Matrix Approach to the Dynamic Simulation of Two-Dimensional Me- chanical Systems. N. Orlandea and J. C. Wiley, Technical Center, Deere &amp; Company; and R. Wehage, Graduate Student, University of Iowa. An efficient computer program for general purpose dynamic simulation of two-dimensional mechanical sys- tems named ADAMS2 (Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems, 2-Dimensional) is described. This program was developed along the same lines as the ADAMS program for simulation of three-dimensional mechanical systems. For two-dimensional analysis this approach results in reduced execution time and storage requirements in comparison to specialized use of the 3D code. 1978 SA E Transactions 780488. Research on a Dual-Chamber Stratified Charge Engine. W. L. Hull and S. C. Sorenson, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL. One alternative to the problem of improving fuel con- sumption while reducing high exhaust emissions is the dual chamber stratified charge spark ignition engine. This paper describes the various phases of the research program now being conducted. Its purpose is to better understand the basic combustion process in this type of engine and the fundamental limitations involved. Typical results obtained in the initial phases of study are illustrated. 780489. Hydraulic Bucket Wheel Excavators - Design and Performance. Walter E. Durst, O&amp;K Oren- stein &amp; Koppel AG, (Dortmund/Germany). For more than fifty years the continuous working bucket wheel excavators have been manufactured by O&amp;K. The development in the past decade gave on one hand the giant machines with a performance up to 240.000 m3 bank per day, on the other hand the full hydraulically driven standard types. The design of the hydraulic bucket wheel excavators with their operation and performance are described. For many opencast mines with middle or high output requirements, the hydraulic bucket wheel exca- vator is an interesting alternative to other methods. 780490. Noise and Exhaust Gas Pollution Caused by Engines in Small- and Medium-Sized Construc- tion Equipment in Japan. T. Azuma and N. Nakato, Diesel Engine Committee of J.C.M.A. In regards to construction equipment, there has been a rapid increase in the number of civil engineering projects undertaken in urban areas over the last ten years. Thus, necessitating further consideration of the pollution prob- lem. Noise and vibration pollution account for a high rate (34%) of construction pollution. In regards to exhaust gas, countermeasures, different from those used against motor vehicles, were put forth to protect the health of the workers. This paper refers to current anti-pollution regulations, user needs, and countermeasures against noise and exhaust pollution, and also includes future problems. 780511. The CF6-32 As A Derivative Engine of the CF6-6. Irwin Mendelson, General Electric Com- pany, Cincinnati, Ohio 45215. A new 30,000 pound thrust class engine requirement has evolved for commercial transport service in the early 1980's. The CF6-32, a derivative of the General Electric CF6-6D high bypass engine, is described. Both engines utilize a common core which is completely interchange- able. Economic justification is developed for the CF6-32. Using the CF6-6D mature core with an initial capability of low shop visit rate, more than offsets the performance advantage that would be inherent in a new engine tailored to the new airplane thrust requirements and available in the early 1980's. 780512. The RB21 1-535, New Member of the Family. S. C. Miller, Rolls Royce Ltd., Aero Division. Although adding to an engine family at the lower end of its thrust range is not a new idea, it is much less common than an increase in thrust at the upper end. From the starting point of 42,000 lb., already extended upwards to over 50,000 lb., the RB 211-535 now extends the coverage of the RB 211 family downwards into the 30,000/36,000 lb. band. In the Rolls-Royce range of engines the Spey Mark 555 developed for the Fokker F 28 is a very successful precedent for such a move. The reason for this thrust requirement is, of course, the well-known search for the right specification of modern fuel-efficient aircraft of intermediate size and, primarily, of short to medium range. While a wide selection of modern aircraft is in service with 250 seats and above, there is a significant gap below this size which has attracted much attention and led to many project designs. It seems very unlikely that, in an expanding market, this gap will be satisfactorily filled without the use of a modern engine design of 30,000/36,000 lb. thrust. 780513. The JT10D- An Engine for the Ws. William Pie, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft. Replacement aircraft studies were conducted throughout the 1970s for the 707/DC-8/and 727-100 fleets which are expected to be largely replaced in the 1980s due to environmental regulations, rising fuel prices and other economic considerations. P&amp;WA chose to offer a new, high-bypass-ratio, high-performance engine, the JT10D, designed at the outset to use new technology materials, processes and components plus the experience of first and second generation turbofans. Late in 1977, P&amp;WA redirected the JT10D program toward a common core engine family to cover the thrust range from 25,000 to 35,000 pounds thrust to satisfy various new airplane 82</page><page sequence="66">780516-780523 requirements. 780516. Airport Dynamic Simulation. Mark Gorstein and Larry McCabe, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Transportation Systems Center, Cambridge, MA. The use of dynamic simulation to model the landside facilities of a modern airport offers a valuable analytical tool to the airport decision maker. Simulation technology can test and rank investment proposals by providing specific projections relating to landside congestion. This paper discusses an operating simulation that models the behavior of persons and vehicles moving through the landside systems. The output of the simulation is statis- tical information regarding the congestion parameters of waiting time, occupancy and flow at landside facilities. A description of how simulation outputs are validated and used in the determination of landside capacity is also included. 780517. Planning the Passenger Terminal. Don Turner, Planning Director - British Airports Authority. The characteristics of the traffic which an airport terminal is required to serve are fundamental to the planning concept, and the way the concept is developed through the various design stages. The full planning process calls for a complete understanding of not only the requirements of airlines, but also the corporate objectives of the airport owner, the standards of service aimed for, the role of the terminal, and the behavioural patterns of the passengers who will use it. The paper discusses these aspects and shows how they impact on the choice of concept and the design process. 780518. Cascade - Queue Model of Airport Users. William J. Dunlay, Jr., Univ. of Pennsylvania. A deterministic, cascade or network queueing algorithm is presented that relates, using a recursive formula, the passenger arrival patterns at components of any two successive stages of airport terminal-building processors as a function of the service times, service rates, and waiting times of components in the first stage and the passenger flow distribution pattern. The effects of ancil- lary activities between two stages are treated with a stimulus-response model; the stimulus is time before departure and the response is ancillary activity usage. An attempt to implement the model using a discrete-time flow model is described. 780519. Issues in the Design and Analysis of Airport Ground Transport Systems. Mark S. Daskin, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cam- bridge, MA. Loop transportation systems are studied. The standard critical link analysis is evaluated and found to be deficient in several ways. The concepts of spatial and temporal service variability are introduced and means of quanti- fying these phenomena are presented. A simulation model is used to assess the effects of service variability on performance or waiting times. The models presented are designed to augment the critical link analysis and to allow designers to gain a better feel for the system behavior before running detailed simulations. 780520. Commercial STOL - The Airplane, the Airport. M. C. W. Davy, The De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Ltd. On the assumption that further building of large airports will be denied the paper examines the scope for upgrading the efficiency of existing terminals by the addition of short runways within their boundaries. It is found that runways of about 2000 feet in length can frequently be placed so as to avoid interference with existing flight paths, partic- ularly when account is taken of the compact maneuvering capability of typical short-field aircraft. This blend of land availability and existing airplane types is proposed as an economically viable near term relief to terminal conges- tion. 780522. A Method for Assessing Turbine Engine Run-Up Noise Impact on Airport Neighbors. Ronald W. Tagg, Propulsion Performance/Stability Div., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. A methodology for assessing ground run-up noise expo- sure/impact resulting from turbine engine performance testing on outdoor facilities was developed. The overall methodology consists of three calculation procedures using dBA levels (measured or estimated) to predict the Day-Night Level (LDN) at any location across existing terrain. The methodology provides the analysis capability required to 1) study noise suppressor requirements in order to minimize costs, 2) locate run-up and test-cell pads, and 3) study the impact of run-up operations changes. It also provides a potential capability for assessing noise exposure from 1) takeoff power check run-ups, or 2) other (non-turbine) static noise sources. 780523. Simulation Study of the Effect of Fuel-Conser- vative Approaches on ATC Procedures and Terminal Area Capacity. L. Tobias, NASA, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; P. J. O'Brien, FAA National Aviation Facilities Ex- perimental Center, Atlantic City, NJ; and E. A. Palmer, NASA, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. Fuel-conservative procedures have been investigated using real-time air traffic control simulations linked to two piloted simulators. The fuel-conservative procedures studied were profile descents and two types of landing approaches. The investigation determined the effect of these procedures on the ATC system and terminal area capacity. It examined the mixing of aircraft executing fuel-conservative approaches with those executing con- ventional approaches. The results indicate a systems fuel savings for the landing approaches under all tested 83</page><page sequence="67">780524 - 780535 conditions except at, or near, maximum system capacity. Also, there is a fuel savings and reduced controller workload for the profile descent procedures. 780524. Recent Development in Wake Vortex Minimiza- tion. R. Earl Dunham, Jr. and Dana J. Morris, National Aeronautics and Space Admin., Lang- ley Research Center. Aircraft trailing vortices are one of the principal factors affecting aircraft arrival and departure rates at airports. Minimization of the trailed vortex strength would allow reduction of the present spacing requirements and full utilization of advances in automatically aided landing systems. For several years, NASA has been conducting an intensive in-house and contractual research effort in- volving theoretical and experimental studies of various wake vortex minimization techniques. The results of these studies are briefly described herein. 780528. False Hypothesis and the Pilot. Robert E. Bürgin, National Transportation Safety Board. Did you mean what I thought you meant when you said what I thought you said? This question is the essence of a phenomenon called a "FALSE HYPOTHESIS". A false hypothesis could be an underlying theme of many pilot error accidents. The possibilities for occurrence in the cockpit must be considered by the pilot and the designer. 780530. Airport Development in Micronesia. Clifford T. Argue, Continental Airlines, Los Angeles, CA. While jet aircraft can be operated into and from short unpaved runways in regular airline service, increased costs and other limitations dictate improved airfields and minimum terminals. Airport development in areas such as the islands of Micronesia in the Pacific requires consid- eration of many factors. Realistic forecasts of require- ments are necessary due to high construction costs for improvements and limited financing alternatives. User airline input and participation must be included in the planning and design process. To maintain maximum flexibility in the air service offered, airports in a region should be studied and developed on a system basis. 780531. Planning, Design and Construction of the Queen Alia International Airport. Raymond J. Hodge, P.E., Partner, Tippetts - Abbett - McCarthy - Stratton, Washington, D.C. The Queen Alia International Airport is being designed to replace the existing Amman airport. This paper describes pertinent background information, conditions encoun- tered, design approaches and construction considerations. The "special environment" factors include: location in a Zone III earthquake region; hot and semi-arid climate; adverse water supply conditions; the type and quality of locally available construction materials; and, local cus- toms and procedures. Proper solutions are being achieved through the performance of investigations; the experience of the local prime contractor; and, cooperation by the several governmental and local organizations. 780532. Planning the High Elevation/High Temperature Airport. Rene J. Francillon and John P. Beatty, International Engrg. Co., Inc. The airport planner working with airports at high elevations is faced with existing conditions that require careful consideration. Of primary concern is the safety of airspace procedures in mountainous areas which are critical and difficult. Very few sites have good obstruction clearances for aircraft approaching the runway or taking off. Another serious consideration is that construction in these areas is expensive, for the airport and for the facilities that are required for its operation, such as highways, power lines, fuel lines and water supply. This paper describes the experiences and approach of the authors and their associates in undertaking the site selection and master planning for future airport devel- opment at Quito, Ecuador which is at 2,812 meters elevation. The city's airport has experienced major impacts from commercial aviation growth in the last two decades. As commercial aircraft traffic increases, the airport is becoming overtaxed physically and environmen- tally. Major improvements are required to remedy this situation. Since this same problem may be facing other airports in similar regions, our experiences at Quito may be of interest. 780533. Large Construction Site Design and Organization in Developing Countries. Calin Popescu, Univ. of Oklahoma, Norman, OK. Temporary facilities for construction projects become an important factor in the bidding stage of a large construc- tion project and should be included in technological drawings and procedures later on. Guidelines for design selection and layout of the following temporary facilities categories are presented: field offices, field laboratory, lodging facilities, road and platforms, water-heating, electricity requirements, repair and maintenance field shops, plant site including tem- porary construction concepts, cost estimating criteria, planning on scheduling of temporary facilities require- ments with the main project(s) schedule. 780535. Rotorcraft for Transport Use - European Re- quirements. Captain D. F. Huggett, A.F.C., Special Projects Manager, British Airways Hel- icopters Limited. The unique operating capabilities of the helicopter have enabled it to become a positive growth sector of the aviation industry. It must be questioned whether the manufacturers and National Authorities are providing the helicopter operator with the right aircraft and the correct regulatory controls to maximise this growth. Modern technology rotorcraft could replace the short haul jet airliner on stages up to 500 miles, replacing expensive and complex airports with simple and efficient heliports. Helicopters incorporating new rotor designs 84</page><page sequence="68">780536 - 780549 could help reduce the environmental noise pollution problems associated with aviation, especially for those areas close to take-off and landing paths. The technology, the skills, and the market are available - surely they must not be wasted. 780536. Helicopter Transport Efficiency Payoffs From Advanced Technology. L. G. Knapp and E. J. Nesbitt, Sikorsky Aircraft, Division of United Technologies Corporation, Stratford, Connect- icut. The new generation of helicopters which will see opera- tional use in the 1980's will provide significantly greater productivity and lower operating costs than their pred- ecessors. Both of these improvements result from tech- nological advances made during the past decade. These advances and the methods used to achieve them are described in detail. Included are the new technology manifested in main and tail rotor blade and head design, composite structures, vibration reduction, and aerodynamic drag. The resulting payoffs are traced to productivity and operating cost benefits, with figures relating to Sikorsky's new S-76 as an example. 780537. Application of Large Helicopters to Commercial Transportation. Newton Rothman, Boeing Vertol Co. The helicopter's unique ability to transport large work crews and heavy equipment to remote areas quickly, cheaply, and efficiently will become increasingly impor- tant and useful as easily accessible resources are depleted. The introduction of large helicopters into operation will result in increased capabilities and expanded application of helicopter transport. Because costs prohibit certifying a new large heli- copter, updating and adapting existing machines, devel- oped under military programs is a very desirable ap- proach. The Boeing Vertol CH-47 "Chinook" helicopter is a prime candidate for this opportunity due to its successful history in the U.S. Army as well as with foreign users. 780540. Overview of the Small Package Air Carrier Industry - A Study of the Operations in Federal Express. Yupo Chan, The Pennsylvania State Univ.; and Ronny J. Ponder, Federal Express Corp. The growth in air freight traffic can be attributed to the increasing number of service and light industries of the United States' economy. Fast and reliable deliveries of small and time sensitive documents are much in demand. The inflation spiral and the thin density of operations, however, have resulted in the discontinuation of air passenger services into small communities. Air freight forwarding, which is an adjunct to passenger service, has been sharply curtailed as a result. A solution to the problem appears to be an all air cargo airline that can operate its own vehicles in a streamlined fashion and can achieve the economy of scale by consolidating traffic. While there are attempts to do this, Federal Express Corporation is an example of innovation. Door-to-door service is provided through its fleet of Falcon jets and pickup/delivery trucks. Traffic is bundled up from thin density markets via a concentrated operation in Memphis. These two features in conjunction allow services to be rendered economically to small and medium size cities. In addition, the consolidated sorting facility and commu- nication center at Memphis allow for a fast and reliable service. The youthful spirit of the airline means that ideas are often configured from afresh. The airline, long qualified as a third level carrier, has operated with a large degree of freedom - outside the confines of regulatory controls. As the company expands and as a set of national air cargo regulations are being formulated, some of the advantages enjoyed by the company may be negated. The future success of the "Federal Express Model" is an interesting case study for both practitioners and research- ers in the air freight industry. 780545. Potential Effect of Curfews on Scheduling and Delays. Guy Goodman, Engrg. and Environ- ment, International Air Transport Assn. The main factors affecting airline scheduling are briefly reviewed and an indication given of the magnitude of the potential problem which might be caused by universal curfews. The effects of such curfews on various classes of airline operations are illustrated by examples and the possible effects on regional economics are examined. 780548. Piloted Aircraft Simulation - Advantages, Dis- advantages, and Practical Problems. Robert L. Stapleford, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. The advantages of ground-based simulation relative to flight test are discussed. These include: lower cost, better control of environmental factors, ability to investigate hazardous situations, completely known dynamics, com- prehensive measurements and measurement accuracy, repeatability, ease of making changes and comparisons, and early availability. The disadvantages and many practical problems are associated with modeling errors and unrealistic pilot behavior. The modeling features discussed are: the aerodynamic model, modeling of atmospheric disturbances, ground effects, landing gear dynamics, sampled-data effects, and extrapolation to very low speeds. Unrealistic pilot behavior results from distortions in the visual, motion, and aural cues, and from differences in psychological factors. Practical problems in each of these areas are discussed. 780549. Certification-Compliance Demonstration by Flight or Simulation? Don M. Archibald, Lockheed-California Co., Burbank, CA. The certification of an aircraft has progressed from demonstrations which were performed entirely upon the 85</page><page sequence="69">780550 - 780556 first-flight article to those in recent years which apply varying degrees of ground-based test facilities (simula- tors). The extent of these test facilities has been influenced by the complexity of the aircraft and the aircraft systems, the individual manufacturer's development philosophy and the funding allocated to simulation. This paper, based primarily on the development and certification of the Lockheed L-1011, concludes that increased simulation to show compliance is not only possible but in many instances is cost effective as well. This conclusion is based on a review of the requirements set down by FAR 25, the methods used to certify the L-1011 and the relative costs of compliance demonstration by flight testing and simulation. The present industry trend towards the derivative aircraft is making the argument for increased simulation for certification even stronger. The data base for the baseline aircraft has usually been well established by the time the derivative comes from the drawing board. Thus simulation, with supporting flight test, may well be the most cost effective means of certification. 780550. The Role of Flight Dynamic Modeling in Heli- copter Certification. K. C. Hansen, Handling Qualities, Sikorsky Aircraft, Stratford, Ct; and G. Mulcahy, Flight Test, FAA N.E. Region, Burlington, Ma. The process of obtaining FAA Certification of helicopters is time consuming and very costly. By using analytic flight dynamic modeling techniques to predict the flight char- acteristics of new aircraft, the amount of flight testing required for certification may be reduced. Sikorsky Aircraft undertook in 1977 a program which was aimed at setting the stage for future reductions in the amount of flight testing required for helicopter certi- fication. This program was initiated by exposing FAA personnel to the makeup of the analytic program and the correlation obtained with flight test data using this program. Subsequently, the analytic model, "Gen Hel," was used to predict S-76 flight characteristics so as to provide apriori data for correlation with the flight data generated during certification testing. The analytic flight dynamic model, Gen Hel, has been used extensively at Sikorsky for stability and control evaluations and in conjunction with the Sikorsky flight simulators for various handling qualities studies. This paper describes the development of the model, validation of the model, how Sikorsky anticipates it could be used in the certification process, and how the FAA foresee using flight dynamics models to support certi- fication. 1978 SA E Transactions 780551. The Promise of Advanced Technology for Future Air Transports. Robert E. Bower, NASA Lang- ley Research Center, Hampton, VA. Aviation is viewed as a growth industry with technological advances continuing well into the 21st Century. While growth constraints to air transportation such as econom- ics, energy, and congestion are very real, technical improvements in dependability, efficiency, and speed will tend to counteract them. Certain NASA activities which impact long-haul (greater than 500 miles) and far-term air transports (1990's and beyond) are discussed. The keys to improved dependability are congestion relief and all- weather operations. Progress in all-weather 4-D navi- gation and wake vortex attenuation research is discussed and the concept of time-based metering of aircraft is recommended for increased emphasis. The far-term advances in aircraft efficiency are shown to be skin- friction reduction and advanced configuration types. The promise of very large aircraft - possibly all-wing aircraft - is discussed, as is an advanced concept for an aerial relay transportation system. Very significant technological developments are identified that can improve supersonic transport performance and reduce noise. The hypersonic transport is proposed as the ultimate step in air trans- portation in the atmosphere. Progress in the key tech- nology areas of propulsion and structures is reviewed. Finally, the impact of alternate fuels on future air transports is considered and shown not to be a growth constraint. 780554. The Need and Impact of Long-Term Advances in Aircraft Technology: The Airlines' Point of View. R. R. Shaw, Asst. Director General - Technical International Air Transport Association. This paper reviews the airline requirements for advanced aircraft technology in the period 10-20 years hence. Primary emphasis is placed on developments neces- sary to minimize fuel consumption in order to both offset expected increases in fuel prices and to prepare for the day when the supply of jet fuel may become restricted. The paper also reviews the probable developments in the pricing and marketing of the airline product and the consequent effects on the demand of the airlines for very high speed aircraft such as the SST and very long range aircraft such as the 747SP. 780556. Directions for Developing an Air Cargo System Planning Model. Peeter A. Kivestu, Dennis F. X. Mathaisel and Nawal K. Taneja, Flight Transportation Lab., Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology. This paper highlights the need and provides a direction for formulating a system planning model to assess the requirements in all segments of the air cargo industry. Currently-operational models of the demand for and the supply of air cargo services are neither sufficiently policy-sensitive nor detailed enough to be responsive to the interactions of both supply and demand.

A Hub Operator's View of Small Aircraft Oper- ations. L. E. Wagener, Broward County Aviation Div., Broward County, FL. The formal definition of a Hub Airport, according to federal authorities, is an airport which enplanes over .05 percent of the total enplaned domestic airline passenger traffic in the United States during a given year. Hub Airports may be subdivided into categories of Small, Medium, and Large Hubs and these category classifications are dependent upon the number of pas- sengers enplaned. As advances are made in airport design and air traffic control techniques, it may be expected that small aircraft, reciprocating engine aircraft of less than 12,500 lb, can be better assimilated into the environment of a Hub Airport without unduly burdening the total aircraft operating system. 780563. Modelling as a Means to Assess Noise Impact. Charles R. Foster, Office of Environmental Quality, Federal Aviation Administration, Dept. of Transportation. The Department of Transportation (DOT)/Federal Avi- ation Administration (FAA) has developed a valuable noise-simulation computer-based tool for describing and defining the impact of aircraft noise around an airport. This tool, the Integrated Noise Model (INM), became available to the public in 1977, and is useful in assessing actual or predicted airport noise impacts. The INM takes into account all pertinent impact parameters including types and numbers of aircraft operating at the airport, flight tracks, operating procedures, and time of day of aircraft operations. This paper will familiarize the reader with the capabilities and characteristics of the INM. 780567. The Airport Capacity Increasing Potential of Angled Runway Exit Designs. Max H. Coggins, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration. This report presents the results of an investigation to determine the causes of low utilization of angled runway exits on air carrier airports, to identify feasible measures to increase their utilization and to assess the probable resultant increase in runway capacity. The areas consid- ered included aircraft runway occupancy time and travel time influence factors including taxiway networks, landing and deceleration procedures, cornering acceleration con- straints, approach profiles and present and possible improvements in future supportive equipment such as glide slope and approach control. No field data was collected. 780568. Relative Pavement Bearing Strength Require- ments of Aircraft. R. C. O'Massey, Section Chief - Design, Civil/Mechanical Technology, Douglas Aircraft Company, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Long Beach, CA. Procedures and charts are presented to develop index numbers for reporting airfield bearing strength. Upon completion of an assessment of airfield bearing strength by the airfield authority, the results are reported as an index number that is a measure of the airplane effect on the pavement system. For reporting purposes, the airplane variables of wheel load, wheel spacing, and tire pressure, and the pavement variables of type (rigid, flexible, or composite), and subgrade strength characterization (strong, medium, low, and extra low strength) are related by means of two theoretical stress/deflection distribu- tions: Westergaard for rigid pavements and modified Boussinesq for flexible pavements. 1978 SA E Transactions 780572. Possible Near-Term Solutions to the Wind Shear Hazard. H. Guice Tinsley, Frank G. Coons and Larry W. Wood, Federal Aviation Administra- tion, Department of Transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration's Wind Shear Program has developed three potential near-term solu- tions to the aviation problems created by hazardous low-level wind shear. They include: development of a ground-based Low Level Wind Shear Alert System to detect and track shear through the terminal areas, development of a Hazardous Wind Shear Advisory Service in cooperation with the National Weather Service to alert pilots when strong wind shear conditions are going to affect airport operations and development of on-board displays to assist pilots in coping with shear during approach and landing. Each of the above potential solutions are reviewed. 780587. Measurement of Air Velocity Distribution and Airflow Rate through Radiator in an Automobile. Kenji Fujikake, Haruo Katagiri and Yoshiaki Suzuki, Toyota Central Research and Devel- opment Labs., Inc. An air velocity sensor has been developed to measure the air velocity distribution at a radiator front. And, an air velocity distribution meter system for a radiator has also been developed, which can display a radiator airflow rate, a constant air velocity line graphs and a perspective representation graph, by use of many air velocity sensors mounted on the radiator front and a computer for data processing. The airflow rate and its distribution under various running conditions for passenger car (1.8 I) has been measured with the air velocity distribution meter. 1978 SA E Transactions 780588. (SP-431) The Inter-Industry Emission Control Program - Eleven Years of Progress in Auto- motive Emissions and Fuel Economy Research. L. J. McCabe and W. J. Koehl, Mobil Research and Development Corporation. 87</page><page sequence="71">780589 - 780593 The Inter-Industry Emission Control Program (IIEC) was established in April, 1967 by Ford Motor Company and Mobil Oil Corporation as a cooperative effort to accel- erate development of a virtually emission-free, gasoline powered vehicle by combining expertise from both the petroleum and automotive industries. The Program continued for nearly eleven years as an excellent and unique example of inter-industry and international co- operation in research. 780589. (SP-431) Optimization of Fuel and Vehicle Parameters. T. R. Nesmith, C. B. Tracy, G. H. Meguerian and B. D. Keller, Amoco Oil Com- pany; and E. E. Daby, Ford Motor Company. Octane number requirement mapping of an 8:1 CR Ford 2.3 liter engine was carried out under dynamic conditions at 1 ", 3" and 6 " vacuum accelerations. Equations were developed relating octane number requirements to engine rpm, manifold vacuum, spark advance, air-fuel ratio, and exhaust gas recirculation rate. These equations, together with Ford's extensive emissions and fuel consumption data, were used to determine whether octane number requirements constitute a limiting constraint in the optimization of engine-vehicle systems. In addition, steady-state and dynamic octane number requirements were compared at 9:1 CR. The results indicate that dynamic octane number requirements cannot be predicted from limited steady-state requirements data. 1978 SA E Transactions 780590. (SP-431) Engine Control Optimization for Smaller Passenger Cars. K. Matsumoto, T. Inoue, K. Nakanishi, S. Matsushita, S. Koganemaru and H. Ooshika, Toyota Motor Co. Ltd. The optimization on an engine-three way catalyst-vehicle system for best fuel economy under the constraints of emissions and driveability, has been studied for a smaller passenger car with 1.6 liter 4 cylinder engine. Full utilization of a computer was intended for the accumu- lation of basic data and a search for optimum calibration. An automatic Engine Test System (AETS) was developed. The optimum calibration was calculated for the engine- vehicle system with three-way catalyst based on the optimal control theory, and was implemented on an actual vehicle by an engine controller in which a 16 bits microprocessor was used. The results showed good agreement. 780591. (SP-431) The Effects of Engine Variables and Exhaust Gas Recirculation on Emissions, and Fuel Economy - Part IV. P. W. Kirklin and S. S. Wise, Mobil Research and Development Cor- poration. Steady state engine mapping data were obtained from a 400 CID, V-8 spark ignition engine at compression ratios (CR) of 9.3 and 8.0. Data were obtained for seven steady-state speed-load conditions and also for one transient condition to determine the effect of compression ratio on fuel consumption at various exhaust emission levels. These speed-load points were selected to represent engine operating points during the CVS-H cycle. Earlier results at high speed-load conditions indicated that lower fuel consumption could be achieved with the 9.3 CR configuration, even when emission constraints for HC and NOx were imposed. Also at the low speed-load conditions, at high or unconstrained HC levels, fuel consumption was found to be lower at 9.3 CR; but HC emissions could not be reduced as far at 9.3 CR as at 8.0. Finally, all of the speed-load points were combined in time-weighted cycle simulations to compare the two compression ratios by several emissions and fuel consumption criteria. 780592. (SP-431) Unregulated Emissions from a PROCO Engine Powered Vehicle. D. E. McKee, F. C. Ferris and R. E. Goeboro, Ford Motor Com- pany. Unregulated emissions, i.e., emissions which are not currently regulated by EPA, have been measured from a 7.5 L (460 CID) PROCO engine powered vehicle oper- ating at 50 kph on a chassis dynamometer. A dilution tube was used. Emphasis was on particulate emissions, which were characterized physically and chemically. A com- parison is made to recent similar measurements on Diesel and conventional gasoline powered vehicles. 780593. (SP-431) Single-Cylinder PROCO Engine Stud- ies - Fuel and Engine Calibration Effects on Emissions, Fuel Economy and Octane Number Requirements. B. J. Hillyer, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp.; and W. R. Wade, Ford Motor Company. Engine-fuel relationships of the Ford PROCO stratified charge engine have been examined. The test program was conducted in three phases to assess the interrelationships between exhaust emissions, fuel economy, octane re- quirement, and fuel properties in an experimental, research, single cylinder, stratified charge PROCO (pro- grammed combustion) engine. In Phase I, tests were conducted at a steady-state speed-load condition to determine the effect of engine calibration parameters on emissions and fuel economy after an initial evaluation of engine operation with three different ignition system configurations. A dual ignition system produced reliable, misfire-free operation with the dilute mixtures and high EGR rates tested. In Phase II, five fuels with significantly different volatility properties and composition were tested to determine their effect on emissions and fuel economy of the PROCO engine. At the same steady-state speed-load condition examined in Phase I, satisfactory operation was obtained at both 0 and 50% EGR with air/fuel ratios as lean as 32: 1. None of the fuels tested produced differences in emissions or fuel consumption which could be of practical use. In Phase III, the Primary Reference Fuel (PRF) and 88</page><page sequence="72">780594-780599 Full Boiling Range Unleaded Fuel (FBRU) octane requirements were determined for the single-cylinder PROCO engine at a series of 13 speed-load points which represents both the CVS-H cycle and certain other engine operating conditions. Subsequently, at six speed-load points where the PRF octane requirement was above 80, the effects of ignition timing, fuel-injection timing, intake mixture temperature, air/fuel ratio, and exhaust gas recirculation rates on FBRU octane requirement, exhaust emissions, fuel consumption, and power output were examined. The data show that the best selection of adjustable calibration parameters for controlling octane requirements depends on the mode of engine operation and the emission, fuel economy and performance con- straints associated with the mode of operation. 780594. (SP-431) ORI of Today's Vehicles- Part III. D. S. Gray, G. H. Meguerian and C. B. Tracy, Amoco Oil Company, Naperville, Illinois. In continued studies with full-scale engines on the laboratory dynamometer, the effect of the engine varia- bles air-fuel ratio, ignition timing, and rate of exhaust gas recirculation on octane requirement increase and exhaust emissions was studied in two engines at two compression ratios. A lead-free base gasoline was used in all tests, and a test procedure previously shown to relate well with road tests was followed. In both engines, ignition timing and rate of exhaust gas recirculation were found to have appreciable effects on octane requirement increase. Air-fuel ratio had an effect in one engine but not the other. The effect of compression ratio was mixed. 780595. (SP-431) The Influence of Cooling System Variables. D. J. Daly, R. D. Anderson and R. E. Baker, Ford Motor Company. A vehicle fleet test has been conducted to determine if octane advantages due to selected cooling system vari- ables persist with stabilized deposits. The variables tested were reduced coolant temperatures, a direct substitution of aluminum for the iron cylinder head and an aluminum head with Unique Cooling. Octane requirements, octane requirement increase (ORI), emissions and fuel economy results are presented and discussed. Engine tests to determine the sensitivity of octane to independently controlled engine temperatures confirmed the primary dependence upon coolant temperature. Additional tests identified some of the variables which cause octane differences among the cylinders of one engine and between engine families. 780596. Fuel Economy Improvements in EPA and Road Tests with Engine Oil and Rear Axle Lubricant Viscosity Reduction. Malcolm C. Goodwin and Merrill L. Haviland, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Effects of reducing engine oil and rear axle lubricant viscosities on fuel economy were determined in EPA combined City and Highway (EPA 55/45) tests and in road tests, using four different sized cars. In EPA 55/45 tests, fuel economy rating improvements averaged about 1.5 percent; warmed-up and cold-start road test fuel economy improvements averaged about 4 and 8 percent, respectively. For a specific engine oil viscosity reduction, warmed-up road test fuel economy increased with de- creasing car mass and power- to-mass ratio. Warmed-up constant-speed fuel economy improvements obtained by lowering only the engine oil viscosity were about the same as those estimated from reductions in engine friction power. However, measured fuel economy improvements with low-viscosity rear axle lubricants were inexplicably higher than those estimated. Although fuel economy results with low-viscosity lubricants were generally favorable, care must be taken to make sure the use of such lubricants will not reduce vehicle performance and durability under a variety of operating conditions. Accordingly, vehicle tests are underway. 1978 SA E Transactions 780597. Testing of Friction Modified Crankcase Oils for Improved Fuel Economy. V. E. Broman, J. DeJovine, D. L. DeVries and G. H. Keller, Atlantic Richfield Company. The use of friction modifiers in fully formulated petro- leum based motor oils for the purpose of increasing fuel efficiency in spark ignited engines has been investigated. Stationary engine test procedures were developed and used as a primary means for evaluating fuel economy potential of automotive oils. Fuel economy improvements with graphite-containing engine oils were greater in cyclic operation than in steady state operation. Vehicle dyna- mometer and controlled road tests with such engine oils also demonstrated improvements in fuel economy. Re- duced viscosity was found to have a positive effect on fuel economy. Conventional oil components such as viscosity index improvers showed evidence for providing nominal differences in fuel economy. Substantial improvements in fuel economy were realized using dispersions of solid particles while retaining comparable viscosity character- istics for the oil. 780599. Improved Fuel Economy Via Engine Oils. Walter E. Waddey, Harold Shaub and Joseph M. Pecoraro, Products Research Division, Exxon Research and Engineering Co.; and Robert A. Carley, Marketing Technical Services, Exxon Company, U.S.A. A fuel-efficient passenger car engine oil has been developed that showed an average of 4.6% improvement in fuel economy compared with several premium, SAE 10W-40 oils (API Engine Service Classification SE) in a road fleet test. In the combined Environmental Protection Agency city/highway testing, this oil gave 5.5% better fuel economy on average than an SE premium 10W-40 oil. The excellent overall performance of this lubricant was confirmed by ASTM Engine Sequence tests and evalu- 89</page><page sequence="73">780601 -780606 ation in severe taxicab operations. The new 10W-40 oil, which incorporates friction- reducing properties, is formulated with petroleum base stocks and known additives, many of which are conven- tionally used. It is expected that advances in friction- related technology developed in this work may lead to oils with even higher levels of fuel economy improvement in the future. 780601. Laboratory Techniques for Evaluation of Engine Oil Effects on Fuel Economy. C. A. Passut and R. E. Kollman, Amoco Chemicals Corp. Test methods to evaluate the effects of engine oil formulations on fuel economy were evaluated using a variety of experimental and commercial oils. The oils were tested in a motor driven engine which showed reduced power requirements for low viscosity oils at low temper- atures and friction reducing additives at high tempera- tures. A single cylinder engine generator was able to show trends for improved fuel economy with friction reducing additives. Automotive engine dynamometer tests were run at several operating conditions and showed fuel economy improvements for low viscosity oils and for oils containing friction reducing additives. Data from vehicles tested on an All Weather Chassis Dynamometer provided an excellent simulation of field service. The laboratory test procedures correlated well with results obtained in the chassis dynamometer. 780602. Development of the Calspan/Chrysler Research Safety Vehicle (RSV). Gardner J. Fabian and Saverio M. Pugliese, Calspan Corporation, Ad- vanced Technology Center; and Alexander J. Szilagyi, Chrysler Corporation. The Research Safety Vehicle (RSV) Program is a four phase effort to develop a lightweight advanced safety vehicle design suitable for family transportation in the 1985 time period. The vehicle design is intended to be compatible with current production techniques, fuel efficient, non polluting, recyclable, and affordable. During Phase I and Phase II of the program, vehicle specifications were established and design concepts evaluated via computer simulations and full scale testing. The program is currently in the third phase of activity. The vehicle design developed in Phase II is being optimized and ten final vehicles fabricated. 780603.

Mr. Donald Friedman was developing vehicle concepts at GM from 1960 to 1968 and has continued this research since then as president and founder of Minicars, Inc. He has participated in the development of urban electric cars, the DOT/AMF/ESV, passive restraints and structural energy management programs. Mr. Friedman is presently in charge of systems analysis and integration of the Minicars Research Safety Vehicle Program. 780604. Description of an Advanced Safety Vehicle. A. Bauer, H. Schimkat and R. Weissner, Volks- wagenwerk AG, (Wolfsburg/W. Germany). Occupant protection was the focal point of the first work in the area of experimental safety vehicles. These first vehicles were heavy and expensive. The second generation of vehicles were designed with more realistic safety features and the goal for mass production. Complying with the modified objectives, the ESVW II was designed by Volkswagenwerk. 780605. Restraint System Evaluation - A Comparison Between Barrier Crash Tests, Sled Tests and Computer Simulation. H. Mellander and M. Koch, AB Volvo, Car Industry Div. The injury criteria measured in belted dummies in frontal barrier crash tests are compared to results from two alternative evaluation methods: Sled tests and mathe- matical simulation. The recorded values from the barrier crash tests and sled tests are compared by two different statistical inference tests in order to establish a possible significant difference between the methods. It is shown that results from barrier crash tests compare well to the results from sled tests except for the injury criteria, SI and HIC, of the driver. Only the passenger's situation was simulated mathe- matically and the results compare well to the results from a barrier crash test except for the HIC number. 780606. (SP-431) Evaluation of Three- Way Catalysts - Part III, Formation of NH3, Its Suppression by S02 and Re-Oxidation. H. S. Gandhi, H. C. Yao, H. K. Stepien and M. Shelef, Ford Motor Company. This is the third and final communication in this series of laboratory evaluation of three-way catalysts. The effect of inlet NO concentration and temperature on the NH3 formation over fresh, pulsator-aged and dynamometer- aged three-way catalysts of the current generation has been investigated under temperatures and exhaust com- positions of practical interest. In spite of differences in aging procedures employed, both the pulsator and dynamometer-aged catalysts show similar selectivity behavior. The effect of S02 in feed-gas on gross NO conversion and NH3 formation was studied over Pt-Rh and Pt-Rh-Ru types of three-way catalysts. A strong dependence of the gross NO conversion on the S02 concentration in exhaust gas mixtures was noted. A simultaneous suppression of gross NO conversion and NH3 formation, in presence of S02 in feed-gas, is attributed to the poisoning of Pt sites on aged three-way catalysts. IR studies of S02 and CO adsorption over Pt, Rh and Ru metals suggest that differences in the surface affinity of these metals to S02 can be related to their observed activity patterns. Finally, reoxidation of NH3 (formed over three-way catalysts) on the vehicle-aged oxidation catalyst was studied as a function of catalyst 90</page><page sequence="74">780607-780612 temperature, excess oxygen and inlet NH3/NO ratio. 780607. (SP-431) Effect of Air-Fuel Ratio Modulation on Conversion Efficiency of Three-Way Catalysts. Y. Kaneko, H. Kobayashi, R. Komagome, O. Hirako and O. Nakayama, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. The widening of the selectivity windows of a three-way catalyst under A/F ratio modulation was shown to result from retention of adsorbed species on catalyst surfaces and their subsequent reaction with gas-phase reactants. A reaction model was developed based on adsorption properties of CO, HC and NOx and by computer simulation, the conversion efficiencies of CO, HC and NOx under A/F ratio modulation were calculated. The calculated and experimental results were in good agree- ment. 1978 SA E Transactions 780608. (SP-431) 50,000 Mile Vehicle Road Test of Three-Way and NOx Reduction Catalyst Sys- tems. W. T. Wotring, The Standard Oil Com- pany (Ohio); G. H. Meguerian, Amoco Oil Company, H. S. Gandhi, F. D. McCuiston and A. G. Piken, Ford Motor Company. The performance of three way and NOx catalysts was evaluated on vehicles utilizing non-feedback fuel control and electronic feed-back fuel control. The vehicles accumulated 80,450 km (50,000 miles) using fuels rep- resenting the extremes in hydrogen-carbon ratio available for commercial use. Feedback carburetion compared to non-feedback carburetion improved highway fuel economy by about 0.4 km/1 (1 mpg) and reduced deterioration of NOx with mileage accumulation. NOx emissions were higher with the low H/C fuel in the three way catalyst system; feedback reduced the fuel effect on NOx in these cars by improving conversion efficiency with the low H/C fuel. Feedback had no measureable effect on HC and CO catalyst efficiency. Hydrocarbon emissions were lower with the low H/C fuel in all cars. Unleaded gasoline octane improver, MMT, at 0.0 15g Mn/1 (0.06 g/gal) increased tailpipe hydrocarbon emissions by 0.05 g/km (0.08 g/mile). 780610. (SP-431) Atypical Fuel Volatility Effects on Driveability, Emissions, and Fuel Economy of Stratified Charge and Conventionally Powered Vehicles. J. H. Baudino and L. C. Copeland, Harvey Technical Center, Atlantic Richfield Company. The effects of fuels having atypical distillation charac- teristics on the driveability, fuel economy, and emissions of vehicles equipped with a variety of power plants were studied. The power plants included conventional, strat- ified charge, port fuel injected, and lean-burn engines. The atypical distillation fuels reflect the effect of removing varying amounts of mid-range or front-end blending components from a typical commercial gasoline. An index system was developed which allows a comparison of fuel effects across a fleet of vehicles differing substantially in terms of driveability, fuel economy, and emissions. Using this index system, the fleet average results show that emissions and fuel economy as well as driveability are depreciated with the extreme atypical fuels and that improved driveability can result in improved emissions and fuel economy. 780611. (SP-431) Fuel Volatility Effects on Driveability of Vehicles Equipped with Current and Advanced Fuel Management Systems. C. R. Morgan and C. N. Smith, Mobil Research and Development Corporation. Fuel volatility and cold/hot engine driveability rela- tionships were evaluated in six 1976/1977 model cars representing conventional carburetor and advanced type fuel metering systems. The program objective was to provide guidance for engine modifications to take advan- tage of fuel benefits or to overcome performance defi- ciencies. There were large variations among cars in the maximum volatility tolerance relative to vapor lock during summer, hot engine operation, with a fuel-injected and a new design carburetor system tolerating gasoline volatility levels in excess of normal maximum summer levels. Similarly, cold engine start and driveaway performance at low and intermediate ambient conditions varied widely. Fuel-injected cars showed the best performance and least sensitivity to gasoline volatility changes. Performance differences among all cars with a specific fuel were significantly greater than differences resulting from typical variations of fuel volatility for individual cars. This shows that fuel systems can be designed to provide good overall driveability performance and wide tolerance in fuel volatility, permitting greater flexibility to produce unleaded gasoline. 780612. (SP-431) The Influence of Fuel Characteristics on Vaporization in the S.I. Engine Cylinder During Cranking at Low Temperature. Y. Naka- jima, T. Saito, Y. Takagi, K. Katoh and T. Iijima, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Yokosuka, Japan. Using five single-component, three dual-component and five full boiling range fuels, the relationship between engine startability under low temperature and fuel volatility was experimentally studied. The study was carried out through the analysis of fuel vaporization and mixture formation in the cylinder. The effect of other factors such as cranking speed, ignition timing and fuel quantity supplied to the cylinder on startability was also examined from the view point of fuel vaporization in the cylinder. A theoretical approach for estimating the startability with fuels of various volatility was attempted. Based on this estimation, the degree of cold startability deterioration with lower volatility fuels and the way to 91</page><page sequence="75">780613 -780619 improve cold engine startability were discussed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780613. Ambient Temperature and Trip Length Influence on Automotive Fuel Economy and Emissions. B. H. Eccleston and R. W. Hum, Department of Energy, Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Experimental work was done to examine the interrela- tionships among automotive fuel economy, ambient temperature, cold-start trip length, and drive-train com- ponent temperatures of four 1977 vehicles. Fuel economy, exhaust emissions, and drive-train temperatures were measured at temperatures of 20, 45, 70, and 100° F using the 1975 Federal test procedure and the Environmental Protection Agency's highway fuel economy test. Results showed that vehicles used for short cold-start trips consume fuel at a much greater average rate than during long trips, and the effect is magnified with decreasing ambient temperature. 1978 SAE Transactions 780614. Fuel Economy and Exhaust Emissions Under Two Conditions of Traffic Smoothness. Robert Herman, Ronald G. Rule and Marvin W. Jackson, Research Lab, General Motors Corp. The potential fuel economy and exhaust emission benefits that might be obtained by smoothing the flow of traffic have been investigated. Substantial improvements in fuel economy and reductions in exhaust emissions are possible if the flow of traffic is smoothed. Traveling during the smooth flow conditions of the early morning (4 am) as compared to travel on the same urban route during highly congested flow (5 pm rush hour) resulted in a fuel economy improvement of 31% for hot-starts and 35% for cold-starts. Also, traveling during smooth flow conditions resulted in reductions in HC, CO, and NOx emission levels of 54%, 52%, and 2% respectively for hot-starts and 35%, 52%, and 13% respectively for cold-starts. The reported results were obtained by simulating traffic conditions on a chassis dynamometer. 780615. Passenger Car Fuel Economy and Relative En- ergy Consumption. Stephen Luchter, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A simple model of the energy required to negotiate the two Federal test cycles is described and then used as a basis for a graphic representation of the relative energy consumption. The utility of the concept is demonstrated by comparing certification fuel economy data and projections with the aid of the relative energy consump- tion plot. 780616. Emissions and Fuel Economy Interaction. Roy C. Nicholson, Advance Product Engineering, Gen- eral Motors Engineering Staff. Data from dynamometer tests is presented which shows the fuel consumption penalty when emission requirements constrain air-fuel ratio to near stoichiometric mixtures. This was verified on one vehicle. 780617. Prediction of Dynamometer Power Absorption to Simulate Light-Duty Vehicle Road Load. Glenn D. Thompson, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When vehicle exhaust emission tests or vehicle fuel consumption measurements are performed on a chassis dynamometer, the dynamometer is usually adjusted to simulate the road experience of the vehicle. In this study, road load versus speed data were obtained from 64 light-duty vehicles. Dynamometer power absorption settings to simulate the measured road loads are computed. These dyna- mometer settings are regressed against vehicle frontal area and vehicle inertia weight. It is concluded that the dynamometer load settings are most accurately predicted on the basis of the vehicle frontal area. The frontal area based prediction system is then improved by separating vehicles into different classes and by including estimations of the effects of the vehicle protuberances. 780618. INCOLL - A New Technology in Emission Testing. Lars Th Collin, Chalmers Univ. of Technology, (Gothenburg/ Sweden). A new Short Test for emission control has been devel- oped, which in short time gives the emission status of a vehicle with very small variability. The principle of this new method is that the vehicle engine is braked against its own inertia forces, in order to reach such pressures and temperatures in the engine that significant quantities of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon oxides will be generated. The method is well correlated to existing emission tests. 780619. The Effect of Restorative Maintenance on the Relationship Between Short Test and Federal Test Procedure Emission Test Results. D. Harold Davis, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Restorative Maintenance Program conducted by the Environment Protection Agency in late 1976 and early 1977 provides short test and Federal Test Procedure data on a large fleet of relatively new consumer owned automobiles. The program included testing of 300 vehicles in Chicago, Detroit and Washington, D.C. The vehicles that indicated a need for maintenance were repaired and retested by the FTP and the five short tests being considered by the agency for the Federal warranty regulations. These data are examined by conventional regression and correlation methods, contingency table analysis and maintenance effectiveness criteria. The conclusions of the study indicate that while the mathematical correlation coefficients are quite low for most of the tests, all five tests are effective in identifying vehicles in need of maintenance and significant hydro- carbon and carbon monoxide emissions reductions can be 92</page><page sequence="76">780620-780624 achieved at relative low vehicle failure rates. The transient mode tests are also effective in identifying oxides of nitrogen reduction potentials. 780620. Vehicle Controllability in a Pavement/ Shoulder Edge Climb Maneuver. Richard H. Klein and Walter A. Johnson, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. This paper describes the results of a test program to evaluate various roadway disturbances present in the driving environment. The specific objectives were to pare down the list of possible roadway disturbances to the worst cases, identify handling problem areas, find mean- ingful response parameters and compare responses of different vehicles which might influence the results. The program provided an accident data analysis, survey questionnaire results and full scale test results which found the pavement/shoulder dropoff (requiring an edge climb maneuver) to be the most severe and most likely disturbance to result in lane exceedance. This occurs when the vehicle is scrubbing one set of tires on the shoulder edge (or encountering the edge at too shallow an angle for climb), thereby requiring the driver to apply a large steering deflection to get the car to climb back onto the pavement. In this case the vehicle will "spin out" if the speed is high enough. Road tests were performed with four passenger cars in an attempt to obtain objective vehicle response per- formance measures as a function of vehicle type, shoulder height and tire parameters (construction, wear and pressure). The tests were divided into two categories: closed loop and open loop. In the closed-loop tests the effects of the driver, the vehicle, and the environment were all included, whereas in the open-loop tests only the basic vehicle response to the shoulder climb was considered. Results derived from these test procedures are discussed in the paper. 1978 SA E Transactions 780621. Half A Century And A Billion Kilometres Safely. T. O. Jones, General Motors Proving Grounds; A. H. Kelly, Vehicle Test Eng., General Motors Proving Ground, Milford, MI; and D. R. Johnson, Light Vehicle Test, General Motors Proving Ground, Milford, MI. After 50 years of parallel development and growth, a comparison of safety statistics between U.S. public highways and the General Motors Proving Ground 200 km private road system shows: the Proving Ground has approximately a five times lower accident rate, seven times lower fatality rate, thirty-five times lower injury rate, and almost nine times lower property damage rate. Accident analysis and preventive countermeasures are discussed philosophically and by practical examples. This exceptional safety record has been achieved by having trained drivers operating well-maintained vehicles on properly designed driving schedules using a road/road- side system designed for safety. All known Proving Ground accident causation factors now have operational countermeasures except sleep, and this remains a problem for which solutions are sought. "Progress: There must always be a better way." 1978 SA E Transactions 780622. The New Fiat Safety Center for a New Philos- ophy in Collision Tests. Enzo Franchini, Fiat Safety Center. Today's fragmentary and heterogeneous regulation re- garding vehicle and components, static and dynamic tests, suggest a new trend for a global evaluation of the vehicle by means of collision tests between the vehicle, with dummies on board, and dynamometric deformable mov- ing barrier. Such moving barrier (always the same) is used in the front collision test as well as in side and rear collision tests. The new Fiat Safety Center is designed not only to enable it to carry out the tests required by present regulations, but also with a view to future test trend. Covering 27 acres, the installation provides for any type of test, with 1370-ft tracks giving a terminal speed of 97 mph for cars and 62 mph for trucks of up to 20 tons. Vehicles are propelled by a two- ton trolley, rolling on angled rails in a culvert below the surface. This is driven by a closed loop of 1-in cable powered by a 2300 hp electric motor, the speed of which is held within a tolerance of 0.25% by a central computer, programmed for each particular crash test. Crash data are transmitted to the control room by a 60-channel cable and a 96-channel radio telemetry system. Signals are processed by computer, with recordings on magnetic tape or digital print-outs. 780624. Effect of Catalytic Emission Control on Exhaust Hydrocarbon Composition and Reactivity. Marvin W. Jackson, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corporation. Exhaust gases from fourteen 1970-4 model and twenty 1975-7 model General Motors cars were collected during 1975-8 Federal Test Procedure tests and analyzed by gas chromatography. Hydrocarbon reactivity was calculated from the chromatographic analyses, using several reac- tivity scales. The use of oxidation catalytic converters on the 1975-7 model cars greatly changed the exhaust hydrocarbon composition in comparison to 1970-4 model cars. In general, such use caused individual paraffins to increase in carbon percent and individual olefins and acetylene to decrease. For example, the methane carbon percent was 5.0 for 1970-4 model cars (nonconverter cars) and 14.5 for converter cars; ethylene percent was 12.5 for nonconverter cars and 7.4 for converter cars; propylene was 6.5 for nonconverter cars and 2.9 for converter cars; and acetylene was 7.9 for nonconverter cars and 2.2 for converter cars. Because of these large changes in hydro- carbon composition, each of the reactivity scales evalu- 93</page><page sequence="77">780625 - 780630 ated indicated that converter cars produced exhaust hydrocarbon mixtures that were less reactive than those of nonconverter cars. The reductions in reactivity per gram ranged from about 10 to 35 percent. 1978 SA E Transactions 780625. The Effect of Fuel Hydrocarbon Composition on Exhaust Emissions from Japanese Vehicles. K. Hosaka and T. Onodera, Toa Nenryo Kogyo K.K.; and Eric E. Wigg, Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Co. The effect of fuel hydrocarbon composition on exhaust emissions was determined according to the Japanese statutory cycles for five Japanese vehicles using seven kinds of unleaded fuels. Vehicles used for the tests were conventional internal combustion engine vehicles with - and without - oxidation catalyst and EGR (exhaust gas recirculation), rotary engine vehicles with - and without - thermal reactor and a CVCC engine vehicle. Hydrocarbon composition of the seven fuels varied from 10 to 50 vol.% in aromatics and from 0 to 25 vol.% in olefin content. The effect of fuel composition on mass emissions of CO, HC and NOx is of little significance for any of the vehicles tested. The hydrocarbon composition in exhaust gas varies substantially with the fuel composition and emission control system of the vehicles. As the fuel aromatics increase, aromatic content in the exhaust hydrocarbon fraction also increases, but olefin content tends to decrease in all vehicles except the catalyst vehicle. The specific reactivity of the exhaust hydrocarbon fraction does not vary much for any vehicle except the catalyst one, even if the fuel hydrocarbon composition varies. The catalyst vehicle shows lower aromatic and olefin contents in exhaust and consequently lower reac- tivity especially on the 10 mode hot cycle than other vehicles. A good relationship between olefin and aldehyde contents in exhaust organics is observed in all data obtained from this program. 780626. Heat Resistance of Floor Coverings. Kiminori Ishii, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. The floor panel temperature of vehicles conforming to the emission control standards is increased because of heat conducted from the exhaust pipe system to the panel. Therefore, we developed model test equipment and through experimentation obtained the heat resistance temperature for various types of floor coverings. Based on the test results, we established the target floor panel temperature, at which normal floor covering conditions can be maintained, and thus provided effective heat insulation for each specific floor covering. 780627. Nonwovens in Automotive Applications. Klaus B. Motte, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp. This paper deals with the various fibers used in nonwoven materials. It describes where and why they are used in automobiles. Included are the history of some products, require- ments and test methods of a needled material as well as a glossary of applicable automotive terms. Typical automotive uses are described in more detail. There is also a brief outline of what might be seen in the future from a fiber, manufacturing or application point of view. 780628. Impact of Gasoline Characteristics on Fuel Econ- omy. J. L. Bascunana and R. C. Stahman, Emission Control Technology Div., U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. This paper discusses information relevant to the impact of the characteristics of gasoline on fuel economy of motor vehicles. In particular, the paper analyzes the impact of the density, volatility, octane rating, and cleanliness of gasoline, as well as the impact of its additives. It also studies the relationship between fuel characteristics, fuel metering, and fuel economy. Furthermore, the paper serves to help explain some of the differences that may be found between the results of the EPA fuel economy tests and the values observed by vehicle owners in normal service. The paper is based on the analysis of the available literature on the subject, as well as on specific information submitted to the EPA by companies engaged in petroleum refining, fuel additives production, and automobile man- ufacturing. 780629. The Performance of Diesel Taxicabs in New York City Taxicab Fleets. Karl Hergenrother, Trans- portation Systems Center, U.S. Department of Transportation. Sixty-six diesel-powered taxicabs, paired with an equal number of gasoline powered cabs, are being operated in three taxicab fleets in New York City. Identical cabs are powered either with Chrysler 225 CID gasoline engines or with Nissan 198 CID diesel engines. Data from both sets of cabs are analyzed to determine differences in reliability, maintenance, exhaust emissions and fuel economy. Data currently reported covers a period where individual taxicabs have accumulated between 70,000 and 110,000 miles of service. The diesel fleet shows improvement in fuel economy and exhaust emissions over the gasoline fleet. 780630. An Emission and Fuel Usage Computer Model for Trucks and Buses. Anil B. Jambekar and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ., Houghton, MI. This paper presents the development of a computer model to simulate fuel usage and emission contributions of the past and future truck and bus population in the United States. The projected future years are beyond 1976 to 1990. The trends in vehicle population growth, yearly miles traveled and ton-miles are also calculated by the model. The model developed is flexible and brings together several technical concepts which reflect recent 94</page><page sequence="78">780631-780635 inputs from industry and government. The formulation of the model is based on a systems approach, in which the several submodels (the "Popu- lation," "Mileage," "Fuel Usage," and "Emission") are interrelated. The preliminary quantitative results are discussed to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the computer model. Increased rates of dieselization are analyzed to determine their effect on reducing fuel consumption and the impact on total emission contri- butions. The use of the computer model to study an urban area for air quality is discussed. It is pointed out that the data availability remains a constraint for regional analysis. A case study of New York is presented to illustrate the use of the model. 780631. Theory and Evaluation of Auxiliary Combustion (Torch) Chambers. T. G. Adams, Ford Motor Company. The theory for the design of an auxiliary naturally aspirated, combustion (torch) chamber relates the gen- eration of combustion turbulence, intensity of turbulence, torch chamber volume and orifice diameter to the basic combustion process. Sample calculations show how to compute the thickness of the combustion wave, the characteristic time of turbulence required to complete the combustion in a given time interval, the optimum torch chamber volume and the orifice diameter. Engine tests show that a significant reduction in HC and NOx emission levels can be achieved through the use of a torch ignition system. The combination of torch chamber geometry and torch nozzle orientation provides a control over the burn rate, rate of pressure rise, flame induced turbulence and swirl. Based on the data from the nozzles tested, the use of a swirling turbulent flame generated near the exhaust valve appears to be the most promising form of torch ignition. 1978 SA E Transactions 780632. An Investigation of Diesel Odor in an Air Aspirated Spray Burner and a CFR Diesel Engine. E. D. Petrow, M. N. Savliwala, F. T. Hsieh, N. P. Cernansky and R. S. Cohen, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. and Mechanics and En- vironmental Studies Institute, Drexel Univ., Philadelphia, PA. A single cylinder diesel engine test facility and an air-aspirated spray burner facility have been modified and instrumented for studying diesel odor formation. Odor sampling and analysis techniques, based on the Arthur D. Little, Inc. Diesel Odor Analysis System (DOAS), have been developed and refined. Emissions mapping of the burner and the engine operating at steady state condi- tions, as well as transient engine conditions, are presented and discussed. The engine mappings presented indicate that operating parameters, such as injection angle, exceptionally high or low compression ratio, and excep- tionally rich or lean air-fuel ratio, can have a significant effect on odor production. The burner results presented indicate that stoichiometry as well as combustion aero- dynamics can strongly influence odor formation. 780633. The Turbocharged Five-Cylinder Diesel Engine for the Mercedes-Benz 300 SD. Kurt Obländer, Manfred Fortnagel, Hans-Juergen Feucht and Ulrich Conrad, Passenger Car Dev. Div., Daim- ler-Benz A.G. The engineering target was a suitable Diesel engine for the largest available luxury sedan. After consideration of various alternatives including the design of a completely new 6-cylinder engine it was decided to equip the existing naturally aspirated 5-cylinder engine presently installed in the smaller sedan and the coupe with a turbocharger. Development time and cost as well as investment could thus be minimized. This paper describes in detail the complete engine and particularly the modifications required to cope with the higher thermal and mechanical loads, the installation and adaptation of the turbocharger, the adaptation of the fuel injection pump, and the refinements of the combustion process. This work, together with suitable turbocharger characteristics due to wastegate control on the turbine side, resulted in an attractive power plant with very good stationary and transient operational behavior. Finally, engine and vehicle performance data including noise, exhaust emissions and fuel economy are given. 1978 SA E Transactions 780634. Data Base for Light-Weight Automotive Diesel Power Plants. B. Wiedemann and P. H of bauer, Volks wagen werk AG. The effects on fuel economy, emissions, passenger car safety and other variables due to the installation of light-weight Diesel powerplants were studied. Experi- mental data was obtained on naturally aspirated and turbocharged Diesel engines installed in .subcompact and compact passenger vehicles. The data include fuel econ- omy as a function of engine type and horsepower, transmission layout, vehicle inertia weight, and of regu- lated emission constraints. Unregulated emissions have been characterized during the course of the work. The compatibility of the Diesel engines studied with passenger car structures incorporating advanced frontal crashwor- thiness capabilities was analyzed and demonstrated with the Integrated Research Vehicle (IRVW). 1978 SA E Transactions 780635. Development of a Flat Surface Tire Rolling Resistance Facility. Stephen E. Lloyd, General Motors Corporation. A high-speed flat surface tire rolling resistance test facility has been developed to evaluate tire rolling resistance characteristics of a free-rolling tire and power transmis- sion efficiency of a driven tire under controlled condi- tions. A continuous steel belt simulates the flat surface roadway. The tire contact patch is supported by means of 95</page><page sequence="79">780636-780640 a hydrostatic bearing. A new three-axis load cell has been developed to measure low fore/aft and lateral forces in the presence of a large vertical force. The load cell allows use of a live axle. In addition, discussions of the measurement instrumentation, the annunciator system, and the machine performance specifications are also presented. 1978 SA E Transactions 780636. Interlaboratory Tests for Tire Rolling Resistance. S. K. Clark, Dept. of Applied Mechanics and Engrg. Science, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; and Dieter J. Schuring, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., Central Research Labs, Akron, OH. A co-operative test program was initiated among various tire manufacturers and test facilities in order to measure passenger car tire rolling resistance with existing equip- ment. The results of these tests showed considerable scatter. After suitable corrections were made for test drum size, for transducer geometry and for ambient tempera- ture, the data clustered much more closely about a single mean value. It is concluded that rolling resistance measurements using different test drum diameters and different transducer elements can be used to obtain consistent rolling resistance data provided that proper correction factors are introduced. 1978 SA E Transactions 780637. Jet Ignition of an Ultra-Lean Mixture. A. K. Oppenheim, K. Teichman, K. Horn and H. E. Stewart, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA. The paper reports a preliminary study of jets of active radicals used as igniters for lean mixtures. The jets were generated either by combustion or by electric discharge. Experiments were performed in a cylindrical steel vessel, 9 cm in diameter and 9 cm long, filled initially with either air or an ultra-lean (equivalence ratio: 0.5) methane-air mixture at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Observations were made by schlieren photography, using a sub-microsecond spark discharge in air as a point light source. The gasdynamic properties of the jets were shown to be primarily governed by their initial velocity, while the particular process by which they were formed played, in this respect, a secondary role. The jets of radicals invariably appeared as turbulent plumes which were embedded in blast waves headed by hemispherical shock fronts. The most interesting properties of jet ignition are: (a) a controllable depth of penetration, so that combustion can be started at any desired location within the charge, (b) zonal pre-turbulization enhancing the combustion process, and (c) a wide dispersion resulting in multi-point ignition, so that combustion is initiated throughout a relatively large segment of the medium rather than in the form of a small laminar flame kernel, as it does in the conventional case of unconfined spark discharge. 1978 SA E Transactions 780638. Experiments in Stratified Combustion with a Rapid Compression Machine. V. W. Wong, J. M. Rife and M. K. Martin, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The foundation for engine performance and emissions models is a phenomenological description of the com- bustion process. In this work, high speed movies and analysis of rapid compression machine experiments have been used to develop an understanding of the mechanisms that control combustion rates in the Texaco Controlled Combustion System. The rapid compression machine experiments are described and results have been interpre- ted to develop a description of the air motion, motion of the fuel spray and the combustion process in the Texaco engine. 1978 SA E Transactions 780639. Modeling Turbulent Transient Combustion. S. C. Sorenson, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL. An analytical study has been performed to investigate the use of a one-dimensional combustion model for transient premixed flames under conditions similar to those occur- ring in a spark-ignition internal combustion engine. The model consists of the numerical integration of the basic conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and species with the effects of turbulence modeled by the use of a turbulent diffusivity. In order to evaluate the effects of some of the assumptions and identify the significant parameters, a simplified system consisting of constant volume adiabatic combustion was considered. With simple chemical kinetics and constant turbulent diffusiv- ity, there are three parameters in the problem: a non-dimensional speed of sound, a non-dimensional temperature rise due to combustion, and a Damkohler parameter relating diffusion and chemical reaction rate effects. Two types of flames were modeled, a flat flame in linear coordinates and a cylindrical flame. The effects of boundary conditions and numerical parameters were investigated. The calculated results for the cylindrical flame were compared to literature data for similar conditions. 1978 SAE Transactions 780640. A Modified Cetane Scale for Low Ignition Quality Fuels. Naeim A. Henein, Wayne State Univ.; and Nabil Y. Elias, Ford Tractor Co. A detailed analysis has been made on the Cetane Scale presently used to rate the autoignition quality of fuels. The effect of the increase in temperature and pressure, as a result of increasing the compression ratio, on the ignition delay has been theoretically and experimentally analyzed. It has been found that the ignition delay is more sensitive to air temperature than air pressure. The sensitivity increases with the drop in the cetane number of the fuel. Many techniques have been examined to modify the present cetane scale. A modified scale has been developed 96</page><page sequence="80">780641 -780647 by raising the inlet temperature from 150° F to 350° F without changing the rest of the rating technique. The modified scale is very effective in extending the scale to zero cetane number and is able to rate the low ignition quality fuels. 1978 SA E Transactions 780641. Performance, Emissions, and Fuel Consumption of the White L-163-S Stratified-Charge Engine Using Various Fuels. R. L. Bechtold, Dept. of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Research Center, Bartlesville, OK. The performance, exhaust emissions, and fuel consump- tion of a White Engines, Inc. L-163-S engine were determined using a gasoline and a diesel fuel. Values of fuel economy and exhaust emissions were predicted for Environmental Protection Agency hot-start urban and highway driving cycles simulated from steady-state re- sults. The emissions calculated for the simulated cycles were found to be similar in magnitude to the calculated before-catalyst emissions of an equally-powerful spart- ignition engine. The diesel fuel produced higher mass emission rates of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide but lower oxides of nitrogen than the gasoline which was used. Fuel consumption and exhaust mass emission rates are presented across the speed and load operating range of the engine. 780642. Effects of Combustion-Chamber Surface Tem- perature on the Exhaust Emissions of a Single- Cylinder Spark-Ignition Engine. James P. Myers and Alexandros C. Alkidas, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Labs. The effect of combustion-chamber surface temperature on exhaust emissions was investigated for wide ranges of air-fuel ratio, speed and volumetric efficiency. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions significantly increase with increasing surface temperature. This effect is strongest at lean air-fuel ratios. In rich mixtures, the demonstrated weak influence of surface temperature on NOx emissions is attributed to NO decomposition reactions occurring during the expansion stroke. With the exception of the extremely lean condition (22.5 air-fuel ratio) the sensitivity of hydrocarbon (HC) emissions to surface temperature was found to be essentially independent of air-fuel ratio. No significant effect of surface temperature on carbon monoxide (CO) emissions was found. 1978 SA E Transactions 780644. Automotive Sulfates - A CVS Compatible Sam- pling System. Melvin N. Ingalls and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and Richard D. Lawrence, U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency. This paper describes the development of a CVS compat- ible sampling system for automotive sulfate emissions. The design resulted from a consensus of ideas from EPA and industry. The system can be used with either a positive displacement pump or critical flow venturi CVS. A mist generator was developed to quantitatively inject sulfuric acid into the tunnel. While sulfate losses were acceptable using the mist generator, with actual automotive exhaust sulfate losses were much higher. The reasons for these losses were investigated. Sulfate losses in the tubing between the car and sulfate tunnel were also investigated. 1978 SA E Transactions 780645. A Study of Fifty-Six In-Use Catalyst Vehicles: Emissions and Fuel Economy. R. E. Gibbs, G. P. Wotzak, B. J. Hill, T. M. Hussey, R. E. Johnson, M. A. Moore, P. L. Werner and S. M. Byer, New York State, Department of Environmental Con- servation, Division of Air Resources, Albany, NY. Emissions and fuel economy have been measured for two years on a group of 56 catalyst vehicles in consumer use and maintenance. Data presented here include idle CO; mass emissions of HC, CO, NOx, sulfate, and S02; and fuel economy. Test cycles used were the 1975 FTP, one hour 50 mph cruise, CFDS and HFET. Fuel economy data are also presented for the same vehicles for over-the-road driving from on-board totalizing fuel and engine hour meters on each car. Sulfur dioxide emissions characteristic of two identifiable modes of carburetor tune were observed upon deceleration to idle and are discussed. Catalyst activity was measured at idle, 30 and 50 mph by exhaust sampling before and after the catalyst. Although 70% of the catalysts were established to be active at 30 and 50 mph, catalyst activity at idle was observed to be much lower when CO was &gt;1%. 780646. Evaluation of Emission Control Technology Ap- proaches for Heavy-Duty Gasoline Engines. Charles M. Urban, Southwest Research Insti- tute; and Andrew W. Kaupert, U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency. This paper summarizes a laboratory effort toward reduc- ing nine-mode cycle composite emissions and fuel con- sumption in a heavy-duty gasoline engine, while retaining current durability performance. Evaluations involved standard carburetors, a Dresserator inductor, a Bendix electronic fuel injection system, exhaust manifold thermal reactors, and exhaust gas recirculation, along with other components and engine operating parameters. A system consisting of electronic fuel injection, thermal reactors with air injection and exhaust gas recirculation, was assembled which met specified project goals. An oxidation catalyst was included as an add-on during the service accumulation demonstration. In addition, the driveability of this engine configuration was demonstrated. 780647. Harmonization of Testing Procedures for Au- tomotive Exhaust Gas. H. Klingenberg, Research and Development, Volkswagenwerk AG (Wolfs- 97</page><page sequence="81">780648-780653 burg/Germany). The legislation to limit the exhaust gas emissions of motor vehicles has led to the evolvement of a variety of measuring and testing procedures which differ from country to country. Our investigations of the mandatory exhaust test procedures existing in the US and in Europe result in proposals which could be a reliable basis of a world-wide harmonized legislation. The recommendations include an improved driving schedule, standardized sampling systems and the introduction of standard test equipment for matching the test cells. Furthermore, modifications of the current evaluation of certification, assembly-line, and in-use compliance testing are given. 1978 SA E Transactions 780648. Calibration Gases for Automotive Emission Testing. J. F. Antonette and D. R. Strain, Vehicle Emission Development Testing, Chrys- ler Corp. Calibration gases are an essential element of pollution measurement. Their importance is emphasized because calibration errors are translated directly to the measured data. The concept of a calibration gas department respon- sible for filling the needs of all exhaust emission test facilities within an organization is a proven method for improving accuracy and precision, reducing test varia- bility and assuring compliance with the law. Centralized handling of zero and span gases for multiple test sites within a facility is cost effective. In our case, installation costs were paid back in less than a year from the savings in product cost, cylinder rental and material handling. 780649. The Influence of Testing Parameters on Exhaust Gas Emissions. D. Schurmann, N. Krause and D. Kinne, Research and Development, Volks- wagenwerk AG (Wolfsburg/Germany). The ambient conditions in the test facilities, the dyna- mometer characteristics, and the test drivers influence the formation of the components in vehicular exhaust gas emissions. To quantify the specific effects a standard test vehicle which is equipped with a mechanized driver and a measuring system is used as a calibrating instrument. Variations of the barometric pressure were found to influence the exhaust test results significantly. Systematic errors up to a factor of two may be caused by malfunc- tions of apparently well-adjusted dynos. Furthermore, the drivers can create large deviations without violating the tolerances of the driving schedule. 1978 SA E Transactions 780650. Improved Driving Cycle for Testing Automotive Exhaust Emissions. M. Kühler and D. Karstens, Research and Development, Volkswagen werk AG (Wolfsburg/Germany). Data acquired from extensive studies concerning the driving behavior in European cities were analyzed and compared to driving cycles used in exhaust emission testing. The US 72 cycle is found to be a good approximation, nevertheless it should be modified. Espe- cially its total duration and its feasibility to weight the engine warm-up phase must be optimized. An improved driving cycle based on the US 72 cycle was developed which lasts 445 seconds. This cycle should be repeated once - using separate CVS sampling bags - so that the influence of the warm-up phase can be taken into account. 780651. Hot Weather Volatility Requirements of Euro- pean Passenger Cars. R. F. Becker, Mobil Oil A.G., U. Ciardiello, Mobil Oil Italiana; F. B. Fitch and C. N. Smith, Mobil Research and Development Corp. This paper reviews studies in Europe during the summer of 1977 to investigate the possibility of expanding gasoline supply through relaxation of existing Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) volatility specifications. Performance parameters investigated included vehicle vapor lock and hot weather driveability under both controlled and consumer opera- tion. Overall, it appears that some existing RVP speci- fications could be relaxed and still provide satisfactory consumer protection levels. This would permit more optimum utilization of available high volatility, high octane gasoline components and expand gasoline product yields while minimizing crude requirements. 780652. A European Cold-Weather Driveability Proce- dure. R. F. Barker, Shell Canada Ltd., S. L. Hirst, Shell International Petroleum Co. Ltd.; and B. D. Caddock, Shell Research Ltd. The cold-weather driveability performance of some European cars deteriorated in the early 1970s as a result of attempts to improve fuel economy and reduce exhaust emissions. Consequently, a test procedure was developed for rating the driveability performance of European cars equipped with manual chokes and manual transmissions so that the effects of ambient temperature and fuel volatility could be assessed. This procedure and its development are described and the effects of fuel quality, ambient temperature and engine hardware on the per- formance of European cars are discussed. 780653. The Hot-Fuel Handling Performance of Euro- pean and Japanese Cars. B. D. Caddock, P. T. Davies and A. W. Evans, Shell Research Ltd.; and R. F. Barker, Shell Canada Ltd. Extensive tests have been carried out with European and Japanese cars to investigate the occurrence of vapour lock and related problems under hot-weather conditions. Different criteria, based on gasoline inspection properties, were evaluated for their ability to control hot-fuel handling performance. Considerable market experience has been accumulated with the flexible control, RVP (mbar) -I- 7E70, which is preferred by the authors to the 98</page><page sequence="82">780654-780661 vapour/liquid ratio type of control because it is far easier to use in routine refinery applications and control. However, the two types of control are equivalent in their ability to predict the performance of a wide range of gasolines, including those which may result from reduc- tions in lead content. In their tolerance to gasoline volatility, the European and Japanese cars are very similar to the catalyst-equipped California models tested by the CRC in 1975. 780654. Feedback Carburetor Control Electronic Design for Improved System Performance. W. R. McDonald, Ford Motor Company. Proper choice of feedback control strategy is not the only consideration in feedback fuel delivery systems. Open loop strategies and design of control electronics effect system performance. A basic description of the system and interactions with the electronic control will be presented. 1978 SA E Transactions 780655. Electronic Spark Timing Control for Motor Vehicles. Paul H. Schweitzer and Thomas W. Collins, Optimizer Control Corp. The spark-Optimizer is a closed-loop type electronic control device that continuously corrects the ignition timing; in effect it re-tunes the engine some ten times every second. In contrast to the better known pre- programmed controls, the Optimizer is an adaptive type system, in which the output influences the input. By providing the correct spark timing all the time, the Optimizer reduces fuel consumption considerably. This paper describes the spark-Optimizer in its advanced version including recent improvements, like biasing. A comparison with other electronic spark control devices show its superiority in accuracy, flexibility, simplicity, and production costs. Samples of test results show considerable fuel savings with the Optimizer. 780657. Factors Influencing Radiated EM Susceptibility Testing of Automotive Electronic Components. M. L. Crawford and J. W. Adams, National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, CO. This paper discusses important considerations for performing meaningful electromagnetic radiated suscep- tibility tests of automotive electronic components. It is written primarily to aid new EMC engineers who are, or will be, involved in evaluating the susceptibility of electronic components and systems. The objectives are to minimize some of the pitfalls so common in performing measurements and to introduce new improved techniques that have been developed or have been proposed. Factors discussed include: 1) a review of some present suscep- tibility measurement technique problems; 2) swept versus discrete frequency testing; 3) test-field exposure time; 4) diagnostic testing; 5) implications of conducted versus radiated susceptibility testing; 6) relating testing results to operational "real world" environment; and 7) the need for complete vehicle testing. Recommended testing proce- dures are then proposed. 780659. An Improved Approach to Man-Made Noise Measurement Techniques. Frederick H. Tabor, IIT Research Institute, Annapolis, MD. Nonpredictable responses to certain kinds of noise have been revealed as a result of past analyses of receiver noise responses. It seemed that certain types of noise were not susceptible of classification as either white Gaussian or impulsive, but rather that some intermediate classification was necessary. The development of an improved measurement tech- nique of man-made noise sources was then undertaken. These techniques would then be applied in the meas- urement of noise radiated by several commonly found man-made sources. The measurement technique developed consists of displaying the noise power spectra in incremented band- widths on a spectrum analyzer. Ten different sources were measured and the bandwidth factors recorded. 780660. Army Experience with Silicone Brake Fluids. James H. Conley and Robert G. Jamison, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment, Research and De- velopment Center, Fort Belvoir, VA. A program to evaluate silicone brake fluids for use in military vehicles operating in various climatic conditions was begun in 1967. After 6 years of laboratory testing and numerous improvements in the characteristics of these fluids, a vehicle field test was initiated in the spring of 1973. Three candidate silicone fluids were selected and installed in M 151 1/4- ton cargo vehicles, and M-715 1-1/4- ton vehicles operating at the Tropical Test Center (TTC), Panama Canal Zone, the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona, and the Arctic Test Center (ATC), Fort Greeley, Alaska. Brake parts were inspected after 1 year of operation, and all parts were removed and inspected after 2 years of operation. After 2 years of service at TTC and YPG, the two water intolerant silicone fluids were significantly better than the water tolerant silicone fluid and the conventional VV-B-680 fluid. At ATC, the water intolerant silicone fluids were removed from test after 8 months due to possible crystallization at temperatures below -50 °F, and two new silicones were installed. The new low temperature silicones were superior to the MIL-H- 13910 arctic brake fluid after 1 year of service. 780661. Silicone Brake Fluids - Show Us the Hardware!. G. W. Holbrook and J. K. Van Sloun, Dow Corning Corp. The properties of silicone-based brake fluids have been discussed in many recent papers and trade publications. Although the performance data are impressive, much of it is based on laboratory evaluation rather than on actual on-road use. The purpose of this paper is to respond to one of the basic tenets of the automotive engineer (Show Us The 99</page><page sequence="83">780662 - 780667 Hardware!). Included will be the results of well over two million miles of fleet testing which have demonstrated greatly improved performance and component life under a wide variety of adverse conditions. 780662. Conventional Brake Fluids - State of the Art. G. P. Rabold, Organic Chemicals Technical Service &amp; Development, Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI. Well in excess of a trillion passenger miles are driven each year in the U.S. in vehicles employing conventional brake fluids based on glycols, glycol ethers, alcohols, polyglycols and other closely related components. The ways in which these components are assembled offer an extremely wide array of physical properties and performance character- istics in a vehicle's braking system. This paper discusses the range of physical properties and performance characteristics attainable in conven- tional brake fluid formulations. The laboratory data is supplemented with field testing data. 780663. Performance and Emission Predictions of a Multi-Cylinder Spark Ignition Engine with Ex- haust Gas Recirculation. P. C. Baruah, R. S. Benson and S. K. Balouch, Univ. of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology. A multi-cylinder four stroke cycle spark ignition engine equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system to reduce nitric oxide emission has been comprehensively simulated in a computer program including intake and exhaust manifolds. The program was tested against experiments performed on a standard production four cylinder four stroke engine equipped with a simple laboratory made EGR system. A nitric oxide emission reduction of about 50% was obtained at the peak NO condition. In spite of simplified assumptions the com- parison between prediction and measurement of some major engine variables was good. The simulation program holds promise as a tool for engine development work. An appendix is added giving the outline of the calculation procedure. 780664. Some Considerations on the Evaluation of Ther- mal Stress in Combustion Engine. A. Garro, Fiat S.A., G.V.F., Progettazione e Sperimentazione; and V. Vullo, Politecnico Di Torino. When power output of automobile engine increases adverse effects resulting from increase of heat load on piston become serious. For a cooling countermeasure it is necessary to clarify the path along which heat is transferred and to be familiar with heat coming from the top surface of piston. In case of small pistons without a forced cooling system at the inside face of piston, most of the heat flows out of piston toward cylinder line through the sliding surface of piston ring and piston. Although it is well known that piston ring is very important as heat passage, details of a heat flow pattern still remain quite unknown. Some authors developed a few experimental studies, but we think it useful to realize a deep theoretical study of the problem. We think also very important to focalize thermal resistance of contact between ring surface and piston. The research results make evident that fluttering of piston way receives heat in a reciprocating way on rear and upper surface. A set of graphs represent thermal field change in twelve moments of operating cycle. 1978 SA E Transactions 780665. Continuous Time Simulation of Forces and Motion within an Automotive Engine. Richard L. Norling, Engrg. Staff, GM. A general purpose model of the internal combustion engine with time as the continuous independent variable has been derived for digital computer simulation. A significant advantage rests in the graphic display of maximum and minimum values of component forces and torques, or any model variable, as a function of crank angle. The differential equations of motion that describe component positions, velocities and acceleration were combined to describe the dynamics of the entire engine. Gas forces, as well as static, viscous and velocity- dependent friction terms, have been included. The IBM Continuous System Modeling Program (CSMP) was used to describe the engine and solve the equations. The model is easily adaptable to many engine configurations. 780666. MISAR - The Microprocessor Controlled Igni- tion System. Thomas W. Evernham and Donald G. Guetersloh, Delco-Remy Div., General Mo- tors Corp. Marking an automotive milestone, microcomputer control has been introduced to a production automobile. The MISAR Ignition System is standard equipment on the 1977 Oldsmobile Toronado which is the first production automobile ever to be equipped with an electronic digital microprocessor. This technological development is the first step toward the use of a programmable digital computer to manage complex vehicle and engine control functions and provide a new dimension of driver con- venience. This paper explains the significance of ignition spark timing in internal combustion engines and describes how the MISAR System provides almost infinite advance curve flexibility to meet the requirements for fuel economy, engine performance and exhaust emissions. The hardware components of the system are described in- cluding the microprocessor and the various engine sensors. Finally, a brief operational description shows how the system functions to compute and execute the desired ignition commands. 780667. Improving Vehicle Fuel Economy with Hybrid Power Systems. Norman H. Beachley and An- drew A. Frank, College of Engineering, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison. Hybrid vehicles, i.e., those containing two or more sources 100</page><page sequence="84">780668-780672 of power, have the potential of increased fuel economy under certain types of driving conditions. Systems cur- rently being investigated include combinations of heat engines, electric drives, fly-wheels and accumulators. In order to obtain fuel economy improvements over con- ventional vehicles, efficient components are required as well as a good system design. Hybrid powerplants appear more promising for heavier vehicles. 780668. Seasonal Octane Specifications. B. D. Keller and J. H. Steury, Amoco Oil Company, Research and Development Department, Naperville, Il- linois; and T. O. Wagner, Amoco Oil Company, Research and Development Department, Chicago, Illinois. Petroleum marketers traditionally supply gasolines of constant octane quality year-round. However, car octane number requirements are not constant, but vary with atmospheric temperature and humidity. Adjusting octane quality to match seasonal changes in car requirements would result in less octane giveaway during periods of low requirements and would reduce gasoline manufacturing costs for the same year-round satisfaction. Because of problems with exchanges, contract sales, and pipeline fungibility specifications, application of seasonal octane specifications on a widespread basis is not feasible unless they are generally accepted by the industry.

Biles, Dept. of Aerospace and Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN. This paper describes a technique for developing a computer simulation model of automotive machining processes comprised of machines, conveyors, overhead monorails, and the parts that flow through this system. Employing the discrete-event modeling features of the GASP-IV simulation language, this technique requires that the modeler (a) describe the process configurations in terms of its elements (machines, conveyors, and mono- rails), (b) provide data inputs that describe the charac- teristics of each of these elements and define their relationships to one another, and (c) provide data inputs that give the simulation conditions. The model then simulates a prescribed duration of production activity and produces both statistical and graphical reports in terms of production output and operational efficiency. Analysis of simulation trials involving several proposed process configurations, including alternative modes of material handling, enables the selection of a preferred design. 1978 SA E Transactions 780670. Mathematical Modeling of Occupant Biomechan- ical Stress Occurring During a Side Impact. Walter Schmid, Daimler-Benz AG (Stuttgart/ Germany). After the frontal impact, the side impact is the next most dangerous frequently occurring accident mode, account- ing for approximately 25% of all injuries and fatalities. Safety research, therefore, endeavors to determine those parameters of the side impact event, which have a decisive influence on the risk of injury to the occupants. Two parameters are the structural rigidity of the impacting vehicle and of the impacted vehicle. Using a very simple mathematical model the possibilities of vehicle compat- ibility in side impacts are being investigated in order to reduce the likelihood of injury to the lowest possible level. 780671. Predicting Crush Response of Automotive Struc- tural Components. Chi-Mou Ni, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Labs; and David S. Fine, Engineering Analysis Dept., Chevrolet Engineering Center, Warren, MI. An analytical technique presented in this paper provides the capability to predict the crush response of certain automotive structural components. This technique was coded from the finite difference formulation to solve the highly nonlinear equations of motion of the structural components when subjected to large deformation. It is operational for production usage. As a production program, it has extensive user conven- ience such as interactive computer graphics in model generation, model editing, and output display. For the purpose of demonstration, four problems solved by using this program will be reported in this paper. 1978 SA E Transactions 780672. Performance and Emission Predictions for a Multi-Cylinder Spark Ignition Engine with Catal- ytic Converter. P. C. Baruah, R. S. Benson and H. N. Gupta, Univ. of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. A mathematical model is developed to represent an oxidizing catalytic converter in the exhaust system of a spark ignition engine in which the flow is non steady. By using the basic mass transfer, heat transfer and chemical reaction rate equations on the path lines the heat generated at the catalyst surface and the friction factor are allowed for in the generalized non steady flow relations using the method of characteristics. The model is included in a multi-cylinder engine simulation program. Secondary air injection into the exhaust system is represented by a simple mixing process without chemical reaction. A series of tests were carried out on a four cylinder two litre engine with a carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon oxidizing converter and secondary air injection. Comparison of results between experiments and computer calculations shows excellent agreement when the converter is new, but that if the catalyst surface is poisoned or aged the hydrocarbon prediction deteriorates. The carbon mon- oxide predictions, however, remain fairly good. The tests 101</page><page sequence="85">780673 -780686 showed that the CO levels entering the exhaust pipe are dependent on the engine condition. Prediction of the overall engine performance and emission levels is very good. The comprehensive simulation program offers an excellent tool for examining practical locations of catal- ytic converters. 780673. A Literature Review of the Effects of Piston and Ring Friction and Lubricating Oil Viscosity on Fuel Economy. James A. McGeehan, Chevron Research Co., Richmond, CA. This paper reviews piston and ring friction which can account for 65% of the mechanical friction in an internal combustion engine. It shows that cylinder liner lubrication is predominantly hydrodynamic with localized contact between ring and liner at TDC firing. The degree of contact may increase during transient conditions. Piston ring friction in the hydrodynamic region is proportional to the square root of the viscosity. The viscosity is affected by temperature and pressure which can reach peak values of 340° F and 4000 psi, respectively. Gains in fuel economy through viscosity reductions have been reduced in the last 25 years due to changes in piston and ring design. Discussion: Richard C.

Performance of Advanced Passive Restraints. Richard W. Carr, Dynamic Science Inc. Advanced research in the areas of vehicle safety and occupant protection in recent years have concentrated on developing systems and techniques that perform at impact speeds of 50 mph or greater. Recent developments on the NHTSA's Research Safety Vehicle program have indi- cated these efforts can be met with some measure of success. The question naturally arises then for the restraint systems as to what their performance would be in a more conventional vehicle. How well would restraint systems which were designed for an advanced crashworthy vehicle structure perform when integrated into a small production vehicle. To investigate these questions the NHTSA sponsored a program at Dynamic Science to integrate advanced restraint systems into a small production vehicle and to evaluate their performance over a variety of impact conditions. The vehicle selected for this program was the 1976 Volvo 244 and the restraint systems used were those developed for the Minicars RSV. The purpose of the program conducted by Dynamic Science was to design the structural interface in the Volvo 244 to support these advanced restraint designs and evaluate their performance under realistic impact con- ditions. The goal was to determine the performance limits in terms of velocity change that could be expected for each of these restraint systems. This necessitated having test velocities which taxed the limits of system per- formance and required some testing be performed beyond acceptable limits for system performance. 780682. Passenger Automobile Fuel Economy Standards for 1981-1984. A. C. Malliaris, R. L. Strom- botne and F. R. Scheiner, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) was enacted into law in December 1975 and is an important part of our national energy program. A section of the EPCA is concerned with "Improving Automotive Effi- ciency" and delegates various rulemaking responsibilities to the Department of Transportation relating to both passenger automobiles and nonpassenger automobiles. The scope of this paper is limited to a discussion of passenger automobile fuel economy standards for model years 1981 through 1984. A review of the background and rationale for the rulemaking is included. 780686. Waste Heat Recovery In Truck Engines. C. J. Leising, G. P. Purohit, S. P. DeGrey and J. G. Finegold, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Insti- tute of Technology. Truck engines currently reject up to 40% of the total fuel energy in the exhaust. Because of increasing petroleum costs there is growing interest in techniques that can utilize this waste heat to improve overall system efficiency. This paper examines and compares improvement in fuel economy for a broad spectrum of truck engines and waste heat utilization concepts. The engines considered are the Diesel, spark ignition, gas turbine, and Stirling. Principal emphasis is placed on the turbocharged four-stroke Diesel engine. Because of increased exhaust energy and a large potential improve- 102</page><page sequence="86">780688 - 780693 ment in performance, the still-to-be-developed "adiabat- ic" Diesel is also examined. The waste heat utilization concepts include preheat- ing, regeneration, turbocharging, turbocompounding, and Rankine engine compounding. Predictions are based on fuel-air cycle analyses, computer simulation, and engine test data. All options are compared on the basis of maximum theoretical improvement. The Diesel and adiabatic Diesel are also evaluated in terms of maximum expected improvement and expected improvement over a driving cycle. The results indicate that Diesels should be turbo- charged and aftercooled to the maximum possible level. Based on current design practices fuel economy im- provements of up to 6% might be possible. It is also revealed that Rankine engine compounding can provide about three times as much improvement in fuel economy as turbocompounding, but perhaps only the same im- provement per dollar. By turbocharging, turbocom- pounding, and Rankine engine compounding, driving cycle performance could be increased by up to 20% for a Diesel and by up to 40% for an adiabatic Diesel. The study also indicates that Rankine engine compounding can provide significant fuel economy improvement for gas turbine and spark ignition engines and regeneration could significantly enhance the performance of spark ignition engines. Because of the low heat content in the exhaust of a Stirling engine it has only a small potential for further waste heat recovery. 1978 SA E Transactions 780688.

A Multi- Vane Expander, By Adding Power, Can Improve The Fuel Economy Of Long-Haul Diesel Trucks. C. S. Robertson, Jr. and S. E. Eckard, General Electric Co. An organic Rankine Bottoming cycle added to Diesel engines used for long-haul trucks has the potential of improving their peak fuel economy by up to 15% over a typical duty cycle. General Electric has developed a multi-vane rotary expander which has a measured isen- tropic brake efficiency of 80 + % over a wide range of speed and power levels with organic working fluids. High cycle efficiency for design and off-design conditions is achieved with the multi-vane expander. The potential advantages of the multi-vane expander for the Diesel engine bottoming cycle include the elimination of a high speed gear box and the potential for over 80% isentropic engine efficiency. The multi-vane expander is a ruggedly built component running at Diesel engine speed. This paper describes the design and evaluation of a nominal 40 HP multi-vane expander for this application. The results of preliminary cycle analysis and preliminary hardware evaluation lead to the conclusion that the multi-vane rotary expander is an attractive alternate to a high-speed turbine/gearbox combination. 1978 SA E Transactions 780690.

Application of Reliability Concepts to Heavy- Duty Vehicle Testing. D. R. Olberts, Reliability Manager, Deere &amp; Company; and R. M. Poter- ack, Reliability Manager, John Deere Engine Works. Management of Reliability Risk is essential to the success of new Product Programs.

In the business of engineering today's trucks, the design evaluation has become very complex and continues to increase in complexity through a variety of factors. The size and diversity of the truck product offering, the requirement to meet government specifications, the increase in design evaluation costs, and the complexity of new technology combine to create this complexity. An approach to solving the complexity of truck design evaluation is an organized three phased attack that integrates vehicle on road testing, physical laboratory testing, and analytical evaluation into a combined effort that will maximize design evaluation output. 780693.

Winnebago Combines Stirling Technology with Unique Motor Home Design. J. Harold Bragg, Winnebago Industries, Inc. The operational characteristics of low noise, low vibra- tion, and inherent reliability of the Stirling engine make it highly desirable as the power source for a total energy system in a motor home. In this application, the Stirling engine has made possible the development of new electrical, heating, and air conditioning systems offering much higher levels of comfort, convenience, and relia- bility to the motor home user. As an auxiliary power source in the motor home, the Stirling engine generates electricity to operate all-electric appliances and recharge batteries, provides efficient hot water baseboard heat to the interior of the motor home, and eliminates the need for LP gas usage in the motor home. And integrated into the cooling system for the Stirling engine is a new, low noise air conditioning system. 780695. Understanding Modal Analysis. Steven C. Walgrave and James M. Ehlbeck, Freightliner Corp. This article reviews the fundamentals of vibration theory and discusses how the concepts used in describing the motion of single mass-spring-damper system can be extended to describe the motion of structures and systems via modal analysis. The material presented progresses from a discussion of a single mass-spring-damper system to modal properties of multi degree of freedom systems to frequency response and mode superposition methods. Although these techniques are not new, the intent is to present the fundamentals of modal analysis for those not already well acquainted with the theory and techniques involved. 1978 SA E Transactions 780698.

Simko and W. R. Wade, Ford Motor Company. The Ford PROCO stratified charge engine combines the desirable characteristics of premixed charge and Diesel engines. The outstanding characteristics of premixed charge engines are their high specific output, wide speed range, light weight and easy startability but they exhibit only modest fuel economy and relatively high exhaust emissions. The desirable characteristic of the Diesel engine is its outstanding fuel economy. However, the disadvantages of the Diesel, which include noisy opera- tion, limited speed range, exhaust odor, smoke, hard startability, and particulate emissions have tended to limit their acceptance. In the gasoline fueled, PROCO stratified charge engine, direct cylinder fuel injection permits operation at overall lean mixture ratios and higher compression ratio. These features enable the PROCO engine to achieve brake specific fuel consumption values in the range of prechamber diesel engines. The PROCO combustion system includes a combus- tion bowl in the piston, an intake port designed to impart swirl to the inducted air, a fuel injector nozzle and two spark plugs. A low penetration fuel spray, together with the in-cylinder air motions, provides for excellent mixture preparation under stratified conditions. The injector nozzle is a unique design which provides acceptable atomization with only 250 psi pressure drop. Dual spark ignition facilitates operation with lean air/fuel ratios and high EGR rates which result in NOx control capability coupled with limited HC and CO control. With the use of oxidation catalysts, the engine has the potential to meet the low mileage emission objectives required for certain future emission standards. The fuel injection pump is designed for good cylinder-to-cylinder fuel distribution, control of injection timing over a wide range and fuel delivery vs. speed characteristics which match the engine airflow characteristics. An experimental control system features a modified speed density concept with variable air/fuel ratio control. The unique fuel spray and injection timing schedule result in full air utilization to provide maximum power capability comparable to a premixed charge engine. In order to maximize the fuel economy at constrained emission levels, mapping tests were conducted on an experimental 6.6L PROCO engine. At eight operating points selected to cover the operating range of urban and highway driving, the air/fuel ratio, EGR rate, injection and spark timings were independently varied. The data obtained from these tests were used to make projections of vehicle results and to define a calibration schedule. The control system was adjusted to this calibration schedule and several engines were installed and tested in vehicles. The results show that the PROCO engine, calibrated to meet the preliminary 4000 mile engineering objectives for the .41/3.4/1.0 gm/mi (HC/CO/NOx) emission standard, exhibits about 20% better fuel economy than the capa- bility of a 1977 baseline vehicle calibrated at the 104</page><page sequence="88">780700 - 780708 1.5/15.0/2.0 gm/mi (NC/CO/NOx) emission standard in the same vehicle. Acceleration, power, octane requirement and startability test results were similar to those of a carbureted engine. 1978 SA E Transactions 780700. The Variable Stroke Engine - Problems and Promises. Donald C. Siegla and Robert M. Siewert, General Motors Research Labs., War- ren, MI. The concept of the variable stroke engine (VSE) is explained and the problems related to its use are discussed. Single cylinder combustion data are combined with published multi-cylinder VSE friction data to formulate an engine model. This engine model is coupled with a vehicle model to make projections of 55/45 fuel economy and NOx g/mile which are compared with similar projections for a throttled engine. At an NOx level of 0.93 g/km (1.5 g/mile), VSE fuel economy improve- ments ranged from 2 to 20%, depending upon the frictional losses and vehicle power-to-weight ratio used in the models. 1978 SAE Transactions 780701. Status of Ceramic Applications in Turbine En- gines. Franklin A. Rockwood, Detroit Diesel Allison. As part of the Department of Energy activities to reduce petroleum consumption, Detroit Diesel Allison (DDA) is conducting a program aimed at advancing the state- of-the-art of utilization of ceramic components in highway vehicle gas turbine engines to reduce fuel consumption by permitting increased gas turbine operating temperatures. Initial components and engine tests of three components are underway at an engine operating temperature 65° F (18°C) above the baseline all metal DDA 404 industrial gas turbine engine. Engine experience totals over 1000 hours on a set of silicon carbide nozzle vanes, 100 hours on a silicon nitride tip shroud and 3000 hours on aluminum silicate regenerators. 780702. Advanced Gas Turbine for Marine Propulsion Model 570-K. D. H. Stinger and W. A. Redmond, Detroit Diesel Allison. An advanced gas turbine, the Detroit Diesel Allison model 570-K has been developed and is available for marine and industrial use. This engine is compact and lightweight with instal- lation and maintenance features suited for economical life cycle costs. The engine is offered in two models that have each been performance matched for a particular use. The 570-KA is "marine matched" and the 570-KB is "high- power matched".

In-Use Motorcycle Sound Levels. Wayne Elliott Marcus, Motorcycle Industry Council, Newport Beach, CA. Among the surface transportation noise control policies under consideration by governmental bodies are the methods of noise control, the magnitude of noise stan- dards, and the priority each vehicle type will receive during the legislative and regulatory processes. A factor in the determination of these policies ought to be the relative contributions of each vehicle type to overall surface transportation noise. To help develop the substantial data base necessary for objective determinations, an inves- tigation crew conducted two days of motor vehicle traffic sound level monitoring. The results indicate significant differences in noise levels and sound energies between motorcycles with stock exhaust systems and motorcycles with modified exhaust systems, and also between garbage trucks, other truck types, automobiles, and motorcycles. 1978 SAE Transactions 780708. Large Amplitude Wave Propagation in Exhaust Systems of Two-Stroke Engines. Michael J. Murphy, Lawrence Livermore Lab, Livermore, CA; and Donald L. Margolis, Dept. of Me- chanical Engrg., Univ. of California, Davis, CA. The characteristics of large amplitude wave propagation in variable area ducts were investigated in order to gain a more thorough understanding of exhaust systems for power tuned two-stroke engines. An apparatus to simulate the power stroke of a two-stroke motorcycle engine was developed, using a stock Yamaha 360 MX barrel, cylinder head, piston and ring. In this way, a single pulse of pressurized air could be introduced into virtually any duct geometry. An ocilloscope trace of the subsequent exhaust pulse and duct interaction was photographed. The 105</page><page sequence="89">780709-780721 resulting pressure-time histories were used to experimen- tally evaluate the effects of several duct terminations on the shape and timing of the reflected wave. The inves- tigation resulted in quantifying the effects of an orifice plate and converging cone termination and in determining the best termination for a Yamaha 360 MX engine. 1978 SA E Transactions 780709. The Moped - The Potential for Saving Over 5 Billion Gallons of Gasoline Yearly in the United States. Serge D. Seguin, Motobecane America, Ltd. The saving of over five billion gallons of gasoline yearly is a potential that cannot be ignored. What this should suggest to legislators, energy plan- ners, transportation planners, urban planners, and econ- omists is that they should encourage the use of the moped in the United States as an alternate form of short-haul transportation. Moreover, this should suggest that they encourage a change of the transportation scene in the United States toward a more compact, efficient, and economical mode of transportation: the moped. 780710. An Investigation Into the Future of Two Stroke Motorcycle Engine. Giovanni Batoni, Vespa of America Corp. Following an analysis of the state of the art, the typical values of emissions and fuel consumption of 2 and 4 stroke engined motorcycles, which comply with Federal Std. 1978 are examined. In view of a further reduction in emission levels, experimental results of an unconventional 2 stroke engine, with reduced losses of fuel mixture during scavenging are reported. Considerable fuel economy is obtained while the reduction in emissions, although less remarkable is not negligible: about 50% of unburned hydrocarbons and 75% of carbon monoxide as compared to a conventional 2 stroke engine of same performances. Fuel consumption, as resulting from tests, is competitive with 4 stroke engines at wide open throttle and quite better at partial loads. Finally, a different approach to emission regulations, based on a total index of pollution, is proposed. On this basis the considered engine, which offers remarkable improvements in energy economy while keeping the advantages of the conventional 2 stroke engine, may be better evaluated. 1978 SA E Transactions 780711.

Norman E. McSwain, Jr., Dept. of Surgery, Tulane Univ.; and Philip V. Hight, Trauma Research Group, Los Angeles, CA. In Medical Aspects of Energy Absorption, a review of medical injury mechanisms are discussed in practical terms. The nationwide adoption of the Abbreviated Injury Scale, derived from the original meetings of the Ad Hoc Injury Severity Committee in the late sixties and early seventies, have led to the more sophisticated and better defined injury severity scale. The statistical review of many automotive accidents are now performed well away from the field investigators and thus have led the people to code and analyze the injuries without really knowing the case and the mechanism by which the injuries were sustained. This paper concentrates mainly on the head, neck, thorax and abdomen. Although serious, permanent inju- ries and occasional fatal injuries can develop later due to trauma to either the upper or lower extremities, this paper deals with direct trauma and the more complex injuries of the upper torso and head of the victim. 780718. Turbocharging Engines for Racing and Passenger Cars. Hans Mezger, Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche, Aktiengesellschaft. The principle of exhaust gas turbocharging is known for more than 70 years. Only since a few years turbocharging is applied successfully to gasoline engines respectively to engines for passenger cars. Mainly a poor throttle response and an unsatisfactory acceleration characteristic prevented turbocharging from general use. The paper deals with the application of turbocharging for racing and passenger car engines. It is reported on the problems, improvements, and Porsche's experiences. The future chances of turbocharging with regard to exhaust emissions and fuel economy are discussed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780721. Energy Use in Field Operations - Opportunities for Conservation. Stanley J. Clark, Mark D. Schröck and John A. Kramer, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS. In 1976 an agricultural production energy conservation project was initiated by Kansas State University and the University of Nebraska. The main objective of the program was to develop a model fuel conservation 106</page><page sequence="90">780724 - 780738 program. This Paper is a report of the results of the project relating to field operations. Results indicated that farmers are interested in saving fuel. The farmers who cooperated in collecting fuel consumption data indicated that fuel record keeping made them much more aware of energy costs for individual operations. Practice of currently available energy con- servation technology results in significant energy savings. The field demonstrations used were highly successful in showing farmers exactly how to accomplish several conservation techniques. Industry can have a very important part in solving the energy-food production problem. Increased emphasis on engine efficiency is needed. Emphasis on fuel conser- vation in instruction manuals and in dealer training needs increased emphasis. Increased instrumentation of tractors is suggested. 1978 SA E Transactions 780724.

Gianni Rigamonti and Gian Luca Zarotti, CEMOTER (Torino/Italy); and Nicola Nerveg- na, Istituto di Macchine, Politecnico di Torino. The X77 Hydrostatic Research Vehicle was completed in the present form during 1977 and officially presented at the International Agricultural Fair in Verona (Italy). This paper reviews some of the major design concepts, features and specifications for this new vehicle. In this context, particular emphasis is applied in presenting favorable aspects of an integral hydrostatic power transmission in the light and perspective of actual and potential trans- mission controls. Problem areas and development options of this approach are also discussed. 780727. The White Model 4-210 Agricultural Tractor. Richard J. Garrity, White Farm Equipment Co. The Model 4-210 Field Boss is the latest articulated four-wheel drive tractor to be manufactured by the White Farm Equipment Company. A major objective in its design was to incorporate the improved features of White's new large two-wheel drive tractors by using as many common components as possible. The paper discusses how this was achieved and presents an overall description of the tractor. 780728. Load Sensing Hydraulic Flow Control - A Ver- satile Controller. Oliver W. Johnson, Eaton Corp. (Char-Lynn). A simple spool valve combined with load sensing principles is used for precision flow control on demand. This type of valve, even though it has been in use for about ten years, received new attention during the energy crunch of 1974 and the subsequent interest in load sensing systems. The load sensing flow control has been used on many applications and especially for power steering circuits where priority flow is needed. The valve functions in all systems: open center, closed center, and load sensing. It provides flow and pressure to a controlled circuit on demand (only as much as needed). This paper describes the function and some appli- cations of the valve and includes system considerations. Generally, a fluid linked power steering system is used for illustration but the same principles can apply to any circuit using a special four way valve. 780735. Some Considerations in Liquid-Cooled Snowmo- bile Design. Samuel Fields, Kawasaki Motors Corp., USA. Some liquid cooled snowmobile design parameters are discussed along with some methods of estimating cooling loads at worst conditions. An approach to design is described using the three conditions of maximum cooling requirement, minimum available cooling and maximum cooling deficiency. Measurements of engine cooling requirements at snowmobile road loads is discussed. A method of measuring heat rejection based upon cooling deficiency is introduced and discussed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780737. High-Output Small-Displacement Two-Stroke Engines. Ted Powell, Technical Services, Hofstra Univ. The data presented here, deals with the conversion of light-weight, air-cooled, reed-valved, chain-saw type, two-stroke engines into high-output, competition motors for powering small recreational, sports and organized racing vehicles. Raising the output of small two-stroke engines via the usual methods, entails some problems associated with their high RPM potentials, reed and rotary-valve induction systems, cylinder and piston ports, crankcase induction, anti-friction bearing crank-trains, air-cooling, and fuel-lubricant combustion. Developing their modification routines involved techniques differing considerably from those encountered in boosting the outputs of small four-stroke engines. Some highlights of two decades of such engine conversion which might be of interest to design engineers, will be discussed. 780738. The Richier A625 Road Roller - Combining Major Components of a Vibrating Road Roller and a Wheel Loader to Create a New Machine. R. E. Dannan, Ford Motor Co.; and J. H. Perrin, Richier, S.A.

The Application of the Federal Boat Safety Act to Boat and Associated Equipment Manufacturers. J. E. Coulter, Boating Technical Div., USCG; and Lysle B. Gray, Boating Standards Devel- opment Branch, USCG. The Federal Boat Safety Act gave the United States Coast Guard authority to require boatbuilders and marine equipment manufacturers to comply with safety regu- lations in the design and construction of their products. Since 1972, regulations have been published with re- quirements for safe powering, safe loading, flotation, fuel systems, electrical systems and compartment ventilation. These regulations have increased the cost of the products, changed some business practices, affected the public image of marine manufacturers and improved the safety of recreational boating. 780745. Boating Safety - A Cooperative Venture. G. James Lippmann, American Boat &amp; Yacht Council, Inc., Amityville, N.Y. Many organizations are involved in the development of different types of standards applicable to the design, construction and maintenance of boats and related equipment. Coordination of this many-faceted effort is essential to the efficient use of available expertise and resources. The American Boat and Yacht Council has assumed the role of coordinator, participating on appro- priate committees and maintaining a close liaison with each of the organizations at the staff level. This coop- erative effort includes a working relationship with the U.S. Coast Guard on both the voluntary and mandatory standards programs. A listing of standards is included. 1978 SA E Transactions 780746. Air Controls for a Truck Mounted Snow Plow and Salt Spreader. James R. Price, Jr., Price Engineering Company, Inc., Waukesha, WI.

Pressure Compensated Electro-Hydraulic Pro- portional Flow Control Valve. Kishor Patel, Dynex Controls Div., Dynex/Rivett Inc. The requirement for reliable, precise positioning of functions with remote actuation promoted the devel- opment of a pressure compensated electro-hydraulic proportional flow control valve. Lower horsepower con- sumption, contamination insensitivity, built-in position feedback, and manual operation in case of an emergency were the prime design criteria. These concepts are discussed in this paper and along with the advantages of utilizing these concepts in typical mobile hydraulic circuits. 780748. Toward a Hydraulic Prime Mover. James Jay Ferris, Ferris Engine Co., Inc., Guilford, CT. This paper deals with the reasons for and the development of an internal combustion engine with an immediately hydraulic output. After looking at some of the advantages to be gained from such an engine, the following consid- erations are then discussed: a hydraulic substitute for the conventional flywheel; quick, efficient starting and stop- ping; converting a declining combustion pressure into a constant hydraulic pressure; operation over a range of system pressure; interface with a hydrostatic transmission, and energy storage and regeneration. 1978 SA E Transactions 780749. Engineering the Complete Forest Concept. Harold E. Young, School of Forest Resources, Univ. of Maine, Orono, ME. The combination of a large population, advanced tech- nology and affluence has reduced the limited deposits of fossil resources. The forests, our natural renewable resource, can indefinitely provide enormous amounts of raw material for energy, food and fodder, conventional solid and reconstituted products, the chemical industries as well as clean air, clean water and recreation. Engi- neering equipment for forest management and utilization are suggested that will insure perpetual viability of the forests. 780750. Tree Harvesting, Now and in the Future. Sam J. Coughran, Rome Industries. The needs for wood fiber are doubling each 20 to 25 years. Adding to this the incorporation of this material into energy, it can be concluded that not only must production 108</page><page sequence="92">780752 -780758 rates increase, but utilization of the available material must increase. This paper reviews what recent technology advance- ments have been made in the harvesting phase of this industry, as well as reviews what future trends are taking place in the development of equipment for this industry. The paper particularly emphasizes that phase of harvesting that deals with the felling or extracting of the standing tree. 780752. Prime Movers for Future Lift Trucks. R. Bertodo and P. Smith, Perkins Engines Group (England). An examination of future trends in lift truck develop- ments suggests a stable product line with a requirement for increased power at a time of escalating fuel costs. Within the time scale of the present survey (up to about the year 2000) only battery /electric and derivatives of conventional reciprocating engines will provide this power. As the turn of the century is approached, a breakthrough in the development of high density, low weight battery systems is forecast, leading to a recovery of lost market share and eventual dominance. In the intervening period gasolene and diesel-derived engines will increase their market penetration, but the opportunity of reducing, or at least containing, operating costs by the introduction of a broad specification fuel oil and injected stratified charge engines will be lost. 1978 SA E Transactions 780753. Techniques for Forecasting Farm and Industrial Tractor Sales. Gary W. Krutz and D. H. Doster, Agricultural Engrg. Dept., Purdue Univ., W. Lafayette, IN; and Jeff Moyer, Harris Bank, Chicago, IL. Various techniques are presented and evaluated for their ability to forecast equipment sales in the agricultural industry. The forecasting methods discussed include trend approximation, time series moving averages, exponential smoothing, Delphi Method, buyer intentions and econo- metric models. A model that predicts future sales for industrial tractors was presented including a 1978 fore- cast. Leading indicators for Industrial Tractor Sales were GNP construction dollars, index of prices of construction machinery and new housing starts. Also, a farm tractor sales model and the resulting difficulty in finding leading indicators were discussed. Statistical methods required for econometric forecasting and model validity testing are given. 1978 SA E Transactions 780754. A Modular Design Concept for Heavy Duty Transmissions of Wheeled and Tracked Vehicles. B. Venkateshwar, Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment, (Madras/ India). A design concept has been evolved for the configuration of heavy duty transmissions through the building-block approach. The functional characteristics inherent in vehicular transmissions are configured by integrating the requisite modules to meet the operational requirements of drive trains for commercial vehicles and off-highway wheeled and tracked vehicles. The functional modules envisaged provide for total interchangeability within a preselected drive train power handling range and the transmission system configurations provide for flexible, compatible and custom-built drive train packages. 780755.

Claude Pinson, Poclain Hydraulics, Inc. The automotive field is in a state of a permanent evolution. Yesterday, mechanical drives were the only solution. Today, Hydrostatics offers new possibilities to the designers. This paper reviews the technical and economical reasons why the concepts of: - High Pressure hydrostatic systems (5 to 6000 PSI) - High Torque Low Speed hydraulic motors - wheel motors - multiflow fixed displacement pumps, contribute to higher vehicle performance then rep- resent the ideal solution for the market of tomorrow. 780757. Practical Methods for Reducing Hydraulic Noise. G. E. Maroney, Fluid Power Research Center, Oklahoma State Univ.; and J. D. Harris, Envi- ronmental Lab, Corporate Test Center, J. I. Case Co. This paper discusses the control of hydraulic noise along the vibration and pressure ripple transmission paths. The basic theories of structureborne and fluidborne noise control are discussed. The examples include quantitative results. 780758. Control of Hydraulic System Noise in a Military Vehicle. Robert N. Baker, H. L. Blachford, Inc. Retrofit noise controls were developed to reduce the noise exposure of the operator of a large Army forklift truck. Various noise sources were studied and modified. The overall success of the program was determined by the reduction achievable in hydraulic system noise reaching the operator by airborne, fluid-borne and structure-borne paths. Practical retrofit modifications to reduce hydraulic system noise included component replacement, introduc- tion of flexible fluid lines, vibration isolation and vibration damping. The overall noise at the operator's ear 109</page><page sequence="93">780759 - 780769 was reduced by 15 dB(A) without the use of a cab and by 22 dB(A) with a cab. 1978 SA E Transactions 780759.

Zibolski, Koehring Co. This paper deals with the preponderance of different regulations in the European community. The author gives design guidelines for new cranes, which if observed in the design stages, can greatly simplify modifying the crane at some later date in order to sell in Europe. 780761. Verification of Removal Criteria of Wire Rope. C. W. Salanski, Wire Rope Corp. of America; and F. Chiappetta, Macwhyte Co. Different types of removal criteria for wire rope appear in standards and regulations that are applicable to wire rope using equipment. Criteria most commonly used is based on visible broken wires. Recent tests conducted by the wire rope industry have provided data regarding remaining strength at the point when a wire rope reaches the removal criteria. Data has also been developed to investigate the relationship between remaining service life from the point where removal criteria is reached to actual rope failure. This test data will be of interest and value to all persons concerned with wire rope; designer, user, and inspector. 780763. Hot-Gas Engine With Piston-Actuated Valve. James W. Akkerman, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. An engine for providing 10.4 kW (14 hp) with efficient throttled performance has been developed for use in a small, remotely piloted airplane. A requirement for operation at very high altitudes resulted in the choice of an oxidizer-independent, monopropellant gas generator to supply energy. One unique feature is a valving concept by which the working piston is used to actuate the gas- inlet-valve poppets. A pneumatic spring is used to provide the proper valve closing force. The exhaust is ported through the lower cylinder. Good life characteristics have been demonstrated by nearly 20 hours of ground and flight testing. 780764. Low Vibration 20 HP Mini-RPV Engine. G. E. Abercrombie and A. G. Bennett, Bennett Aero- technical Corp., Auburn, AL. The recent advent of small remotely piloted aircraft as tools for both military and civilian missions has set a requirement for reliable, low vibration, compact, recip- rocating engines in a power range where such engines have not previously been available. A new twin crank, geared output engine is being developed to satisfy this requirement. The special feature of this engine is its very low vibration. An analysis and the resulting balance criterion that gives this low vibration is presented. 780766. Unsteady Gas Flow Through Reed Valve Induc- tion Systems. E. T. Hinds and G. P. Blair, Mechanical and Industrial Engrg. Dept., The Queen's Univ. of Belfast, (Northern Ireland). Previous publications from The Queen's University of Belfast have described the unsteady gas flow through a naturally aspirated two-cycle engine and the most recent of these have detailed the scavenge process, the combus- tion model and muffler design. It is thus now possible to predict the unsteady gas flow behaviour through and the performance and noise characteristics in this type of engine with a good degree of accuracy. This paper describes a mathematical model which has been formu- lated to simulate the action of the two-cycle engine fitted with a reed valve due to the unsteady gas dynamic behaviour in the inlet tract and makes comparisons with measurements. A complete simulation on the computer of a two-cycle engine fitted with a reed intake valve is thus now possible. 780767. Low Pressure Electronic Fuel Injection System for Two-Stroke Engines. Edmond Vieilledent, Development and Research, Motobecane. After making a quick general survey of the different injection systems which have been testing for some years, the author describes a new direct low pressure fuel electronic injection system specially adapted to the two stroke engine. Very short time of about a millisecond can be obtained at high flow variation by controlling electromag- netically the ballistic movement of the injector needle. The monitoring electronic control can be carried out by an opto-electronic memory or a static one (M.O.S.) by microprocessing. The performances of such system are specially interes- ting with regards to the specific fuel consumption decreases about 30 to 40 per cent compared with an engine fed through a carburettor. The unburnt H.C. emission level, which until now condemned the two-stroke engine, are greatly decreased. 1978 SA E Transactions 780769. The Design of Inline Fuel Injection Equipment for Automotive Diesel Engines. Derek Williams, Lucas CAV Ltd. This paper outlines the problems posed to the designer of fuel injection equipment suited to engines developing from 1 1 Kw (15 bhp) to 75 Kw (100 bhp) per cylinder and deals in detail with the improvements made to several 110</page><page sequence="94">780770 - 780776 highly-stressed components in order to make significant increases in service life. The paper then reviews the resultant Lucas CAV range of equipment, concentrating on the Maximec pump and the associated ancillary equipment. 1978 SA E Transactions 780770. The Robert Bosch In-Line Injection Pump (Type "P") for Diesel Engines - Further Development of a Proven Line of Injection Pumps. Max Straubel and Reinhard Schwartz, Robert Bosch, GmbH (Stuttgart/West Germany). The Robert Bosch series of In-Line Pumps currently serves engine output requirements ranging from 13 to 268 BHP per cylinder. In this family of injection pumps, the type P in-line pump is mainly applied to heavy-duty, direct injected truck engines, with power output up to 80 BHP per cylinder. Since 1962 approximately 1.5 million pumps of this type have been supplied to the field. Advanced development of the Diesel engine aimed toward increased power output and more favorable exhaust emissions have made further development of the injection system necessary. Conversely, however, the continued development of the injection system provides the possibility of realizing these improvements to the engine. As a contribution to this development, Robert Bosch has redesigned the "P" pump. 780771. High-Cycle and Impact Fatigue Behavior of Carburized Steels. D. E. Diesburg, Climax Molybdenum Company of Michigan, Ann Ar- bor, MI. The influence of residual stress and retained austenite on the fracture behavior of bend test specimens of carburized steels was evaluated. The test results are part of an ongoing research effort intended to compare the relative fracture properties of alternate grades of steel and their respective standard grades having similar hardenability. In general, steels of equal hardenability and core carbon content exhibited similar fracture behavior. Compressive residual stress in the carburized case was found to significantly influence the impact fracture stress which, in turn, was correlated with impact fatigue properties. High levels of retained austenite at the surface caused the peak compressive residual stress to occur further into the case. The occurrence of residual stress peaks further into the case was not necessarily detrimental to impact fracture stress or impact fatigue properties. High-cycle fatigue limits were more dependent on processing variables than on differences in alloy content. 1978 SA E Transactions 780772. Impact Properties of Selected Gear Steels. Michael M. Shea, General Motors Research Laboratories. The unnotched Charpy impact properties of carburized 8620, 4620, 4620 + 0.3 Mo, and 3310 were studied at two case depths. The ranking of the alloys in order of increasing impact strength for both case depths was: 8620, 4620, 4620 + 0.3 Mo, 3310. Increasing the nickel content of carburized steel resulted in greater crack initiation resistance in the carburized case. Increasing the molyb- denum content, while maintaining the nickel content constant, increased the crack propagation resistance of the core material. Additional tests showed the amount of austenite which transformed prior to fracture and the fracture strain increased with nickel content. The greater amount of austenite transformed during straining before fracture results in the improved crack resistance of carburized cases of the high nickel steels. 780773. Pitting Resistance of Some High Temperature Carburized Cases. S. L. Rice, Research Dept., Caterpillar Tractor Co. Surface type gear pitting failures were produced on a geared roller test machine and the pitting life data was statistically analyzed by a method that accounts for or minimizes the influence of variables that determine the fatigue environment. The sensitivity of pitting fatigue failures to microstructure is demonstrated. Rollers were carburized at three elevated temperatures, including vacuum carburizing at 1900°F. Direct quench coarse grain rollers had significantly lower pitting life. Pitting life increased when rollers were reheated after carburizing for grain refinement. 780774. Development of the WABCO 353FT Twin En- gine Elevating Scraper. Cedric G. Hurst, WABCO Construction and Mining Equipment Group, An American Standard Co., Peoria, IL. The development of the WABCO 353FT Twin Engine Elevating Scraper for surface mining applications is an example of advancements being made in mining equip- ment technology. The 353FT optimizes the benefits of the various scraper configurations available by combining the ability to work under adverse conditions, due to its all wheel drive, with large capacity and the self loading feature of an elevating scraper. 780776. Soil Excavation Improvement from Bulldozer Blade Oscillation. Joseph M. Brown, Mechanical Engrg. Dept., Mississippi State Univ. Tests and analyses are presented on bulldozer blade oscillation configurations for improving dozing produc- tivity. The purpose of oscillation is to decrease the ratio of tractive force to blade force, since dozing costs are so strongly dependent upon tractive force. The oscillating blade mass, frequency, amplitude, and direction of motion for optimum performance are determined using an approximate theoretical analysis. The theoretical results are compared with experimental results obtained from the literature. Reasonable agreement is obtained. Oscillating blade configurations are presented which should realize double the present dozer performance. In addition, those 111</page><page sequence="95">780777 - 780785 configurations provide complete isolation of the dozer from the inertial forces of the oscillation system. Prior to obtaining the analysis, full scale configurations for a U.S. Army D5 dozer were designed, built, and tested. The tests showed around 20% and 30% improvement with the two configurations. 1978 SA E Transactions 780777. Brake Testing and Lining Evaluation of Large Off-Highway Mining Trucks. Donald R. Thomas, WABCO Construction and Mining Equipment Group, An American-Standard Co. This paper is a result of the advent of new and much more stringent braking codes that are evolving for the braking performance of off-highway open pit mining trucks. The paper reports a series of actual truck performance tests to learn if stopping performance is predictable, to learn about the fade characteristics of the available linings, and to compare the actual brake performance to the theo- retical performance. Various combinations of load, grades, and speeds were used for comparison. Results show that designing a brake system to its static K value is not acceptable, that a level equivalency test of stops on ten percent grade is not practical, and that to insure similar linings will behave similarly they must be tested. 1978 SA E Transactions 780778. The Driveline as a Source of Vibration. Robert G. Joyner, Universal Joint Div., Dana Corp. The driveline in an application can be the source of vibrations. This paper explains and gives corrective procedures for driveline vibrations caused by unbalance, torsional excitation, inertia excitation and secondary couple effect. It also briefly explains the influence of the driveline on the system bending resonance of the engine- transmission package. 780780. From Water to "Super-Stabilized" Antiwear Hydraulic Oils. R. H. Schmitt, R. J. Poole and J. Shim, Mobil Research and Development Corp., Research Dept., Paulsboro, NJ. A new generation of "Super-Stabilized" antiwear hy- draulic oils has been developed to meet the stringent requirements of modern high-performance hydraulic systems. Outstanding performance properties of this type of heavy-duty industrial hydraulic oil include: multi-metal compatibility, "keep-clean" performance, antiwear reten- tion, thin oil film inhibition, controlled demulsibility, and wide-temperature-range pumpability. A review of power transmission fluids used in earlier equipment designs is presented going from the "Water Age" to the "Mineral Oil Age." 780781. Thermal Effects on Diesel Engine Pistons. Manfred D. Roehrle, MAHLE GmbH, Stutt- gart - Bad Cannstatt (Germany). Along with the increase in specific output of internal combustion engines the determination of piston temper- atures in diesel engines and the possibility of influencing these temperatures has attained greater and greater significance. After a survey of the temperature conditions of pistons in non-turbocharged and turbocharged diesel engines and the various temperature measurement tech- niques used to determine piston temperatures, this paper will concentrate on some of the different parameters in pistons for diesel engines in the diameter range of 100 to 140 mm and will present their effects with the aid of comparative investigations.

Yahraus, Engine Parts Div., Gould Inc. Peak oil film pressure is cited as the parameter controlling the fatigue life of a sleeve bearing. Variables affecting peak film pressure, and the freedom to control them, are discussed. Bearing clearance is the variable most readily controllable, and has the greatest impact on film pressure. Through a simple design change to the conventional sleeve bearing, substantial improvements in fatigue life can be realized for any bearing alloy. Tests in both engines and bearing fatigue rigs have confirmed the validity of the theory on which the design is based. Advantages and implications of the new bearing design with respect to heavy-duty diesel engines are discussed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780784. High Performance Bearings. R. L. Widner, W. K. Dominik and A. J. Jenkins, The Timken Co. High performance bearings made of consumable electrode vacuum arc remelted steel, properly internally contoured, etc. can be the answer to initial design problems as well as to problems with prototype or established machines. The economic and/or design advantages are well worth investigating. In order to consider the high performance bearing as a potential alternative or solution it is necessary to know the total environment in which the bearing is to operate. 1978 SA E Transactions 780785. Planetary Speeds Made Easy - A Practical Meth- od. Dan Mihal, John Deere Dubuque Works. Planetary drives used to transmit power are quite common in a wide range of equipment. It is important to the designer, therefore, that the speeds and loading of all members of such planetaries be simple to calculate and check with confidence. Calculation errors in the design and build stages of the product can be most costly and time consuming. The method of calculation presented and described in this paper will be most easily understood by the beginner and will in addition permit experienced designers who have heretofore utilized other methods of calculation to further check their arrangements. 112</page><page sequence="96">780786 - 780789 Examples and illustrations will show that simple principles of Statics and Kinematics can be applied to the solution of any planetary regardless of arrangement or complexity. 1978 SA E Transactions 780786. The Effect of Secondary Fuel Injection on the Performance and Exhaust Emissions of an Open- Chamber Diesel Engine. Samuel O. Onyegegbu, Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Nigeria (Nsukka/ Nigeria); and Jay A. Bolt, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Secondary injection in a diesel engine is defined as the introduction of additional fuel into the combustion chamber after the end of the main injection. It is usually caused by residual pressure waves in the high-pressure pipe line connecting the pump and injector. When these waves exceed the injector opening pressure, secondary injection occurs. Tests revealed that the U.S. Army TACOM single- cylinder engine used in this investigation, fitted with an American Bosch injection system, had secondary injection within the normal engine operating region. The pump spill ports and delivery valve were redesigned to eliminate secondary injection, in accordance with previously reported work. Comparative tests of both the conventional and modified injection systems were run on the same engine, and the effects of secondary injection on engine power, economy, and exhaust emissions were determined. The results indicate that secondary injection increased smoke, unburned hydrocarbons, and specific fuel consumption. Power was reduced. 780787. Diesel Exhaust Particle Size Distributions - Fuel and Additive Effects. David B. Kittelson, Daniel F. Dolan, Richard B. Diver and Eberhard Aufderheide, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. Particle mass and size distribution measurements have been made on the exhaust of an Onan prechamber diesel engine. Seven fuels were examined: no. 1 and no. 2 diesel fuel, 40 and 50 cetane number secondary reference fuels, and no. 2 diesel fuel doped with three different concen- trations of Lubrizol 565, a barium-based smoke suppres- sant. The no. 1 and no. 2 diesel fuels and the 50 cetane number reference fuels produced very similar emissions with emission indices in the range 0.3-1.3 mg (gm-fuel)-1 and volume mean diameters between .09 and 0.15 /mi. The 40 cetane number reference fuel produced both smaller emission indices, 0.2 to 0.8 mg (gm-fuel)-1, and particle diameters, 0.03 to 0.09 /xm. These reductions were apparently related to the longer ignition delay period of the 40 cetane number fuel, which allowed better mixing of the fuel and air prior to combustion. Doping no. 2 diesel fuel with Lubrizol 565 led to decreases in particle size and Bosch smoke number, but in most cases, the emission index increased. The additive apparently suppresses the production of light absorbing carbon particles, but at the same time leads to the formation of dense but only weakly light absorbing barium-containing particles. 1978 SAE Transactions 780788. Physical Size Distribution Characterization of Diesel Particulate Matter and the Study of the Coagulation Process. N. J. Khatri and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. Diesel particulate matter in both the diluted and undiluted state is subject to the processes of coagulation, conden- sation or evaporation, and nucleation which causes continuous changes in its physical characteristics. The Electrical Aerosol Analyzer (EAA) is used to measure the diesel particle size distribution in the MTU dilution tunnel for a naturally aspirated direct-injection diesel engine operated on the EPA 13 mode cycle. The design and development of accurate and re- peatable sampling methods using the EAA are presented. These methods involve both steady-state tunnel and bag measurements. The data indicate a bimodal nature within the 0.001 to 1 /xm range. The first mode termed the "embroynic mode" has a saddle point between 0.005 to 0.015 /xm and the second mode termed the "aggregation mode" lies between .08 to .15 /xm for the number distribution. The particle concen- tration decreases with time and the resulting size distri- bution function approaches an asymptotic steady-state solution indicating the self-preserving nature of particu- late size distributions. Coagulation constants have been calculated for the diesel particles and are compared to theoretical values in the literature. 1978 SAE Transactions 780789. Nondeterministic Analysis of a Four-Wheeled Model Vehicle Traversing a Simulated Random Terrain. Mamerto L. Chu, The Univ. of Akron; and George R. Doyle, Battelle Research Insti- tute. In order to increase confidence in the reliability and accuracy of the linear random vibration theory in predicting vehicular behavior, an experiment was per- formed with a four-wheeled model vehicle with an independent suspension system. The vehicle has three degrees of freedom - vertical translation, pitch, and roll - and was made to traverse at different speeds, a simulated road bed with randomly distributed surface roughness. Using linear random vibration theory, equations giving the power spectral density of each degree of freedom about the center of gravity of the vehicle were derived as a function of the power spectral density of the vertical displacement of the four wheels. Utilizing both numerical and experimental techniques, a direct comparison was made between theoretical predictions and experimental results. The linear random vibration theory was found to give reliable predictions at higher speeds and at rougher 113</page><page sequence="97">780831 -780840 terrain. Deliberate asymmetrical loading of the model vehicle was found to have little effect in the reliability of the linear random vibration theory predictions. A comparison between results of linear random vibration theory and a numerical - nonlinear technique has shown the superiority of the former in predicting experimental results and with relatively minimal com- puting time requirement. 780831. (P-76) Power Train Control: A Convergence of LSI Technologies. Robert N. Noyce, Intel Cor- poration. Electronically controlling future automobile power trains will require a number of technologies to perform various functions.

(P-76) Electronic Reliability Issues Relative to Automotive Product. J. G. Rivard, Electrical &amp; Electronics Division, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan. The increased usage of electronics in automobiles, especially in critical engine control and safety related applications, makes electronic component reliability a major concern. As the automobile customer becomes more quality conscious, reliability becomes a more and more important sales factor. This paper addresses the needs for improved and predictable reliability for auto- motive electronics. Reliability enhancement will require improvements in packaging, testability, device design and fabrication processes. Electronic components will have to have reliability designed-in rather than "yielded-in." There are also needs for improvement in predictions of reliability performance in the field and for alternatives to screening techniques to eliminate infant mortality. Im- provement of automotive electronics reliability will require better communication and more joint efforts on the part of individual vehicle manufacturers and members of the electronics industry. 780834.

Flanagan, The Bendix Corporation. Automotive engine control is one of the fastest growing electronic applications in the industry stimulated by legislative requirements on emissions and fuel economy. All of the systems in use or under development will add cost as compared to historical components used for control of fuel, spark and EGR. As the most complex problem, fuel control offers the best example to suggest some of the directions for cost reductions and the most 114</page><page sequence="98">780841 -780854 likely areas where continued development will uncover benefits associated with the more complex but expensive electronic control systems. The availability of low cost, high speed semiconductor electronics and the devel- opment of fast response sensors and actuators compatible with feedback control concepts will play an important role in this evolution. The rate of growth for electronic engine control will be limited only by our effectiveness as suppliers in meeting these challenges. 780841.

(P-76) Electronic Engine Controls At Ford Motor Company. D. F. Hägen, Engine Engi- neering, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan. The impact of the electronics industry, specifically the semiconductor industry, on automotive engine controls is evident in engineering programs at Ford Motor Company. Within the last four years, a new engineering organization has been established to design and develop these new electronic engine control systems. Additionally, the control system engineers are bridging the gap between engine system engineers and semi-conductor designers to create micro-computers, sensors and actuators with the latest technology. The tangible results of this new engineering activity are seen in the applications of electronics to engine controls at Ford. Starting with the 1978 model year and continuing with the announced 1979 model year appli- cations, approximately twelve new components have been developed and released for manufacturing through the cooperative support of the semi-conductor and automo- tive industries. 780843.

(P-76) Chrysler's Digital Spark Timing Com- puter. J. L. Webster and J. P. Lappington, Advance Product Development, Chrysler Cor- poration, Huntsville Electronics Division. Automotive companies are presently designing microprocessor based electronic products. The cost effectiveness of large scale integrated (LSI) microcom- puters makes possible the design of sophisticated, yet economical engine controls. To effectively utilize micro- computer technology, automotive product designers need to learn new engineering disciplines, including micro- computer software. Understanding how to evaluate hardware versus software tradeoffs to develop a minimum component count system that has the flexibility to incorporate changes, is a fundamental requirement for a high volume production design. An example is a micro- computer digital spark timing control unit that can be programmed during assembly to match engine specifi- cations for four, six, or eight-cylinder engines. 780851.

Energy - Uncertainty and Reality. Richard H. Stanley, Stanley Consultants, Inc. While national energy needs are evident and the measures to be taken are apparent, these realities and the achieve- ment of realistic objectives are clouded by uncertainties. If energy problems are to be dealt with effectively and constructively, the uncertainties must be minimized and the decision-making processes for project approval must be efficient, quick, and fair. If indecision persists, the nation will miss its oppor- tunity for an orderly transition, resulting in radical and severe dislocation when energy sources are finally exhaus- ted. Because constructive action is needed, those indi- viduals knowledgeable in energy matters must become involved in the public and political decision-making process. 780866. EPA MPG - How Realistic?

New Developments in the Air Transport of Plutonium. J. A. Andersen, Transportation Safe- ty Technology Div., Sandia Labs., Albuquerque, NM. A new package for the air transport of plutonium has been developed in response to a United States Public Law which restricts the U.S. air transport of plutonium except for small medical devices. This new package, called PAT-1 for plutonium air transportable package model 1, is the result of the NRC-sponsored PARC (plutonium accident resistant container) project at Sandia Labora- tories, Albuquerque. The PAT-1 package is designed to meet or exceed new criteria specified in NUREG-0360. These include a severe test sequence of impact (&gt;250 KTS) on an unyielding target, crush, puncture, slash, a large JP-4 fire for 1 hour, followed by water immersion, with stringent acceptance standards on plutonium release, nuclear shielding, and nuclear criticality. The PAT-1 package design features a high energy absorption capability with high-level fire protection. It weighs approximately 227 kg (500 lb) when loaded with 2 kg Pu02, and can accommodate up to 25 watts thermal energy from the plutonium load. 1978 SA E Transactions 780871.

Future Large Cargo Aircraft. Roy H. Lange, Lockheed-Georgia Co. The design of future cargo aircraft is affected by environmental constraints, escalation of the cost of fuel, and inflation of the costs of development and operation. This paper presents the results of Lockheed parametric design studies of the application of advances in tech- nology to future subsonic cargo aircraft envisioned for operation in the 1990 - 2000 time period. The relationship between air cargo growth and cargo aircraft design is addressed in terms of aircraft capacity, containerization of cargo, and the aircraft and ground interface. The benefits of advanced technologies on environmental impact are illustrated in improved fuel efficiency, reduced noise levels, and reduced energy cargo aircraft. The advanced technologies utilized to provide potential benefits in fuel efficiency and operating economy include laminar flow control, advanced composite structures, and advanced turbofan and torboprop engines. Design concepts include high aspect ratio wings, distributed-load spanloader configurations, and wing-in-ground effect. 1978 SA E Transactions 780875. A New Look Proposed for Future Air Cargo Terminals. H. F. Morrison, Advanced Cargo Systems, Douglas Aircraft Company, McDon- nell Douglas Corporation, Long Beach, Cali- fornia. Airport land and operational constraints will force future air cargo terminals to assume a new look if they are to accommodate continued air cargo growth. Improved terminal utilization coupled with cooperative airline endeavors in the use of modular container terminals offers a viable solution which can reduce container handling costs by 40 percent and better through economies of scale. Using a building-block approach with innovative and state-of-the-art equipment, a universally applicable con- tainer terminal module is derived which can accommodate growth in customer service level as required, and in multiples can accommodate increasing air cargo flow levels. Example module requirements to the year 2005 are derived for representative U.S. cities. 780876. Analysis of a Cargo/Logistics Airlift System Study. J. M. Norman, R. D. Henderson, F. C. Macey and R. P. Tuttle, Lockheed-Georgia Company, Marietta, Georgia. The Cargo/Logistics Airlift System Study (CLASS) is an outgrowth of the widespread interest in an advanced air cargo system. In this program NASA seeks to determine more specifically the nature of user requirements for expanded air freight capability. The purpose of the study is to examine the nature and degree of air cargo demand in the 1990 period, assuming that an advanced air freight system were available to the shipping community. NASA wishes to determine whether the requirement for such an airplane is sufficient to justify continued or accelerated research and development activities. In-depth "case 117</page><page sequence="101">780877 - 780886 studies" were conducted of a number of companies who are representative of potential users. As a part of this study, Lockheed developed a domestic and international air freight forecast, using case study results, for an advanced dedicated air cargo system. A representative domestic and international route structure has been developed from the forecast. An analysis of fleet mix and economics of current and advanced cargo aircraft will be presented. 780877. SAE on the International Air Cargo Scene. Ray V.

Planning of cargo facilities depends on important vari- ables such as demand forecasts, technological progress, design techniques and the existing policy directives. This paper assesses the effects of an evolving tech- nological environment on the other basic planning considerations. The nature of the planning process is described and related to a forecasted technological scenario for major Canadian airports in 1990. The impact of planning and operational problems on the substance and scope of cargo related government policy is examined within the context of an actual policy review program. 780885. (P-77) The Variation of Human Tolerance to Impact and Its Effect on the Design and Testing of Automotive Impact Performance. J. A. Searle, J. Bethell and G. Baggaley, Motor Industry Research Association. One of the major difficulties in the safety design of motor vehicles is the variability of road accidents. This varia- bility arises in part from the external accident conditions, such as the direction and velocity of impact, and also in part from the variation of the occupant, including such factors as size, weight, location and impact tolerance. The effect of such variability is to undermine the validity of a "typical accident" approach, in which a design is tested at a single speed with a single size of dummy and a single injury criterion. Working from a statistical approach, using methods originating from statistical mechanics, this paper derives a quantitative measure of the injury probability, taken over the whole spectrum of road accidents. This gives an objective measure of injuries taken over the whole population of car occupants and accident situations, and therefore provides an assessment of the vehicle's impact injury potential which is more closely related to the road situations. The paper also includes a solution of the related optimisation problem, that is the provision of the optimum force/deflection characteristic (within a given space) to minimise the injuries on the road. 1978 SAE Transactions 780886. (P-77) Incidence and Severity of Cerebral Con- cussion in the Rhesus Monkey Following Sagittal Plane Angular Acceleration. Jacob M. Abel, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Divi- sion of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsyl- vania, Philadelphia, PA; Thomas A. Gennarelli and Hiromu Segawa, Division of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. A series of forty experiments has been performed on Rhesus monkeys in which the heads were subjected to a controlled single approximately sinusoidal pulse of an- gular acceleration about a fixed axis perpendicular to the sagittal plane. The head was constrained to undergo planar motion with a total angular displacement of 60 degrees in each case. Angular acceleration values ranged up to 1.2 X 105 rad/sec2, and peak values of tangential acceleration at the center of the mass of the brain reached 1300 g's. Physiological and neurological data including EKG, EEG, systemic arterial pressure, intracranial pres- sure, respiration, corneal reflex, were recorded. The post insult state was evaluated for each subject in accordance with a scale of Experimental Trauma Severity (ETS) based on the observed changes in the physiological and neurological variables. The ETS scale ranges from 0 (absence of any changes) to 6 (instantaneous death with gross brain fragmentation). The severity of the injury correlated well with the mechanical input in terms of acceleration (angular or tangential) and in particular, with the maximum value of the resultant tangential force (ranging up to 910 Newtons) applied to the brain. The occurrence of subdural hematomas originating in the parasagittal bridging veins in 16 of the experiments is well correlated with peak values of tangential acceleration with onset occurring at values of 700 g's. Results are also given in terms of the incidence of cerebral concussion (occurring in 27 out of the 40 studies) as a function of mechanical variables including angular acceleration, brain mass, and pulse duration. The results display a statistically significant gradation of reversible trauma effects with increasing mechanical input. Subdural hematoma formation appears as a threshold phenomenon, the consequences of which dom- inate the clinical outcome. 1978 SAE Transactions 118</page><page sequence="102">780887 - 780890 780887. (P-77) Results of Experimental Head Impacts on Cadavers: The Various Data Obtained and Their Relations to Some Measured Physical Parame- ters. C. Got and A. Patel, IRO/IRBA, Raymond Poincaré Hospital, Garches (France); and A. Fayon, C. Tarrière and G. Walfisch, Laboratory of Physiology and Biomechanics Peugeot/ Renault, La Garenne - Colombes (France). This report describes the results of 42 tests involving direct impacts on the head, performed on fresh, unembalmed, perfused cadavers, helmeted or not helmeted, by means of a free-fall procedure. Three main kinds of impact were investigated: frontal, temporal-parietal, and frontal-facial. The results yield a typology of lesions (associated with various test conditions) that differs from the one described in earlier, similar reports published by A.M. Nahum and R.L. Stalnaker. The measurements confirm a tolerance level of HIC&gt;1500 in the case involving skull impacts under the conditions specified in the text. 780888. (P-77) Effect of Initial Position on the Human Head and Neck Response to +Y Impact Accel- eration. C. L. Ewing, D. J. Thomas, L. Lustick, W. H. Muzzy III, G. C. Willems and P. Majewski, Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory Detachment, New Orleans, LA. The response of the human head and neck to impact acceleration has been previously reported for the -X (chest to back) and +Y (right to left) directions. Wide ranges of sled peak acceleration, rate of onset of acceleration and duration of acceleration have been investigated and reported. A major mechanical effect on the dynamic response due to initial position for the -X direction has been reported. The purpose of this study is to report the initial position effect on the human head and neck response for +Y direction experiments. Four initial positions of the head relative to the first thoracic vertebral body (Tj) have been investigated over a range of sled acceleration peaks from 2 to 7G. The data from six young adult male volunteers representative of a wide range of anthropometry will be presented. There are 18 experiments for each volunteer for a total of 108 experiments. The effect of initial position on the resulting head angular and linear acceleration, velocity and displacement will be presented. A comparison of the initial position effect for -X and + Y direction experiments will be made. The ability to model the initial position effect will be discussed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780889. (P-77) Dynamic Characteristics of the Human Spine During -Gx Acceleration. Naveen K. Mital, Richard Cheng, Robert S. Levine and Albert I. King, Wayne State University. Spinal kinematics and kinetics of human cadaveric specimens subjected to -Gx acceleration are reported along with an attempt to design a surrogate spine for use in an anthropomorphic test device (ATD). There were a total of 30 runs on 9 embalmed and 2 unembalmed cadavers which were heavily instrumented. External photographic targets were attached to Tl, T12 and the pelvis to record spinal kinematics. The subjects were restrained by upper and lower leg clamps attached to an impact seat equipped with a six-axis load cell. A rigid link 486 mm long and pinned at both ends was proposed for use in an ATD as a surrogate spine. An optimization method was used to obtain the location and length of a linkage which followed the least squares path of T1 relative to the pelvis. 1978 SA E Transactions 780890. (P-77) Sensitivity of Porcine Thoracic Responses and Injuries to Various Frontal and A Lateral Impact Site. David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Labo- ratories, Warren, MI, Charles Y. Warner, Keith Hoopes, C. Mortenson and R. White, Mechan- ical Engineering and Animal Science Depart- ments, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT; and Charles G. Artinian, Department of Cardi- ology, St. Joseph Hospital, Pontiac, MI. Classical blunt thoracic impacts have involved midsternal anteroposterior loadings to an upright-positioned subject. Data on the sensitivity of human cadaver and/or animal model biomechanical and injury responses to blunt loadings at different sternal locations is needed to evaluate the efficacy of current injury-potential guidelines for nonsite-specific frontal impacts. In addition, the biomechanics and injury mechanisms associated with lateral impacts constitute a subject of increasing consid- eration for occupant protection. Twelve anesthetized pigs were subjected to various blunt frontal or a right-side impact to assess biomechani- cal and injury response differences in a living animal model. For frontal impacts, thoracic compliance (i.e., sternal acceleration, normalized deflection, blood over- pressure, as well as force-deflection characteristics) and injury (i.e., skeletal and visceral trauma, and conduction dysfunction) were significantly affected by the location of the sternal load. Impacts above midsternum (to a relatively stiff thorax) produced infrequent skeletal dam- age but serious mediastinal hemorrhaging and lung laceration; whereas, impacts below midsternum (to a more compliant thorax) resulted in extensive skeletal damage and liver laceration. For lateral impacts, large penetration into the rib cage produced serious liver injuries with extensive near-side skeletal damage in one case and no fractures in the other. The evaluation of functional response to impact was enhanced by analysis of potential heart dysfunctions and of variations in blood catecholamines. Disturbances of the myocardial conducting system were observed from multi- lead ECG recordings. Left anterior hemiblock was 119</page><page sequence="103">780891 -780895 frequently observed after impacts at or below midstern- um. The block either resolved or progressed to ventricular fibrillation in several minutes. In an analysis of the induced stress, a transient increase was observed in plasma catecholamine concentrations which was rapidly alleviated within minutes after the impact. 1978 SA E Transactions 780891. (P-77) Development of a Promising Universal Thoracic Trauma Prediction Methodology. Rolf H. Eppinger, NHTSA/DOT; Kenneth Augus- tyn, Adaptronics, Inc.; and D. Hurley Robbins, HSRI/U of M. Analysis of experimental acceleration time history data obtained from a thoracic instrumentation array has been performed. The data were generated under test conditions which include realistic frontal impacts in belt, air bag, and steering column systems and side impacts with rigid and padded door structures. Data from frontal and lateral pendulum impacts were also included. The results demonstrate that the instrumentation array captures sufficient information from the impact event to allow prediction of resulting thoracic trauma, defined either as thoracic AIS or total number of thoracic fractures, using a single function for each injury measure. Each function is universal in the sense that it is valid for all test modes and directions of impact. A strategy for developing a surrogate thorax to implement this injury predictive methodology is discussed and preliminary specifications are presented. 1978 SA E Transactions 780892. (P-77) Correlation Between Thoracic Lesions and Force Values Measured at the Shoulder of 92 Belted Occupants Involved in Real Accidents. J. Y. Bruno-Foret, F. Hartemann, C. Thomas, A. Fay on and C. Tarrière, Laboratoire de Physiolo- gie et de Biomécanique PSA/RNUR, La Garenne - Colombes (France); C. Got and A. Patel, IRO/IRBA, Institut de Recherches Ortho- pédiques de l'Hôpital Raymond Poincaré, Garches (France). The 3-point static belts that are installed in Renault and Peugeot vehicles are equipped with a force limiter near the upper anchorage. This system is made up of several bands of textiles that tear successively for the increasing levels of force exerted by the occupant. One can thus associate, for each person in the accident, the degree of the thoracic AIS and the value of the support force, expressed in daN. This relationship is established for 92 belted occupants who were involved in frontal impacts. In addition it is indicated which are the distributions of impact violence parameters incurred and which are the distributions of ages in order to determine the statistical meaning of the required results. The levels of tolerance observed in this sample are compared to thoracic injuries observed on belted cadavers exposed to equivalent violent impacts. 1978 SA E Transactions 780893. (P-77) Evaluation of Air Cushion and Belt Restraint Systems in Identical Crash Situations Using Dummies and Cadavera. Michael J. Walsh and Barbara J. Kelleher, Advanced Technology Center, Calspan Corporation. An experimental program is discussed wherein fresh cadavera and anthropometric test devices (ATD) were exposed to identical crash situations utilizing both belt and air cushion restraint systems. Results will include symmetric and one-half offset frontal full size car-to-car tests conducted on the Calspan Vehicle Experimental Research Facility (VERF) at 60 MPH closing speed. Data obtained include head and chest triaxial accelerations from externally located sensors and thoracic accelerations from implanted sensors on the cadavera, normally measured internal triaxial head and chest accelerations and femur loads on the ATDs and belt loads for both cadavera and ATDs. Osteologie data allows comparison between the cadavera regarding their relative skeletal quality. Results of the study allow comparisons of the restraint systems effectiveness with respect to cadaver vs. cadaver and cadaver vs. ATD based upon autopsy evaluations and acceleration measurements. 1978 SA E Transactions 780894. (P-77) Comparison of the Dynamic Responses of Anthropomorphic Test Devices and Human Ana- tomic Specimens in Experimental Pedestrian Impacts. Howard B. Pritz, Battelle Columbus Laboratories. As part of NHTSA's overall program on pedestrian injury reduction, Battelle has conducted several comprehensive experimental studies using both anatomic specimens and adult and 6-year-old child dummies to investigate the injury related effects of vehicle front end geometry and compliance. One of the initial objectives was the design and development of suitable adult and 6-year-old child dummies for use as pedestrian surrogates. This paper (1) describes the design specifications for the dummies and subsequent improvements during extensive experimental testing, and (2) compares the dynamic responses of the dummies with those of unembalmed cadaveric specimens in pedestrian impact situations. The comparison of the dynamic response for similar experimental impact con- ditions between the unembalmed cadavers and the adult dummy shows a high degree of similarity in acceleration levels, physical displacement, and time phasing. 780895. (P-77) Whole-Body Human Surrogate Response to Three-Point Harness Restraint. Nabih M. Alem, Bruce M. Bowman, John W. Melvin and Joseph B. Benson, Biomechanics Department, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Uni- versity of Michigan. 120</page><page sequence="104">780896 - 780898 The general objective of the Whole-Body Response (WBR) research program was to generate data on the kinematics and response of human surrogates in a realistic automobile impact environment. The program used a test configuration consisting of an idealized hard seat rep- resentation of a car seat with a three-point harness restraint system. Three different severity levels of crash test conditions were used. The human surrogates tested in this program were fifteen male cadavers, a Hybrid II (Part 572) Anthropomorphic Test Device and a Hybrid III ATD recently developed by General Motors. In addition, mathematical simulations of the response and kinematics of a 50th percentile male occupant were performed at the three levels of crash severity, using the MVMA Two- Dimensional Crash Victim Simulator. The primary utility of the data generated by this program is for comparing the similarities and differences in response and kinematics of the various types of human surrogates and in pointing out areas that need improvement in both anthropomorphic test devices and mathematical models. 1978 SA E Transactions 780896. (P-77) Bolster Impacts to the Knee and Tibia of Human Cadavers and an Anthropomorphic Dum- my. David C. Viano, Clyde C. Culver and Roger C. Haut, Biomedical Science Department, Gen- eral Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI, John W. Melvin, Max Bender and Roger H. Culver, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; and Robert S. Levine, Department of Orthopaedics, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI. Knee bolsters on the lower instrument panel have been designed to control occupant kinematics during sudden deceleration. However, a wide variability in car occupant anthropometry and choice of seating posture indicates that lower-extremity contacts with the impingement bolster could predominantly load the flexed leg through the knee (acting through the femur) or through the tibia (acting through the knee joint). Potential injuries asso- ciated with these types of primary loading may vary significantly and an understanding of potential trauma mechanisms is important for proper occupant restraint. Impacts of the bolster panel against the knee or lower leg were simulated in 10 human cadaver and anthropomor- phic dummy tests and the following aspects were assessed: 1) biomechanical response for lower-extremity impacts, 2) potential mechanisms of skeletal and ligamentous trauma, 3) differences between human cadavers and an anthro- pomorphic test dummy response, and 4) knee-joint ligament failure characteristics in isolated knee-joint tests. Knee impacts with a 55.9 kg bolster covered mass at 6.0 m/s resulted in frequent avulsion fractures of the posterior cruciate ligament at its osseous attachment to the tibia with peak contact loads of 7.02 kN (7.74 kN peak dummy femur load). In this study, analysis of high-speed movies and radiographs indicated that the bolster loaded against the tibial tuberosity early in the event, translated the tibia posteriorly and resulted in a stretching of the posterior cruciate ligament. Lower-leg impacts produced tibial/fibular fractures or knee-joint ligament failures with peak bolster contact loads of 5.15 kN (4.21 kN peak dummy femur load). Isolated knee-joint tests indicated complete failure of the ligament after 2.26 cm of relative posterior tibial subluxation and a resistive load of 2.48 kN. However, the absolute values of the maximally tolerated loads may be significantly influenced by the deficiencies of the cadaver model and cannot be directly extrapolated for real-life situations. Since the lower extremity of the dummy cannot accommodate translatory motion at the knee joint and the skeletal mass of the dummy signif- icantly exceeds that of the human, substantial kinematic and biomechanical response differences occurred between tested human cadavers and an anthropomorphic dummy. 1978 SA E Transactions 780897. (P-77) Injury Mechanisms in Side Impact. D. Cesari, M. Ramet and D. Herry-Martin, Labora- toire des Chocs et de Biomécanique Organisme National de Sécurité Routière (France). Side impact accidents are the most severe and second frequent traffic accident configuration. By a comparison of results of tests with and without intrusion, this paper shows that the severity of side impact for the occupant seated near the impacted side is mainly due to intrusion of the side wall inside the car compartment of the struck car. Without intrusion, injury criteria recorded on a dummy are much lower than when there is intrusion. The influence of intrusion can be explained by the deformation speed of the side wall of the struck car. The velocity change of different parts of cars and of dummy have been determined in two tests conducted at 40 and 50 Kph. The diagrams of these velocity changes indicate that the door and the frame seat of the struck car sustain a velocity change higher than the car floor. The pelvis of the dummy seated near the impacted side sustains a velocity change in the same order of magnitude as the door, whereas its chest has a lower velocity change. This paper concludes that preventing from intrusion will decrease the severity of side impact and the seat can be used to participate in this stiffening. A padding should also be necessary but the determination of its charac- teristics needs a better knowledge of human tolerance to side impact. 780898. (P-77) Means for Effective Improvement of the Three-Point Seat Belt in Frontal Crashes. Lars G. Svensson, FFV Industrial Products Division (Sweden). Current design of seat belt systems may provide insuf- ficient protection for the car occupant. Thus occupants may sustain head injuries due to large head excursion. Chest injuries may occur due to unfavourable restraining geometry or excessive belt slack. Finally, spinal injuries may appear due to high vertical loads on the body. Using basic criteria of favourable biomechanical 121</page><page sequence="105">780899 - 780903 restraining, design improvements of a conventional three-point seat belt system are proposed. It is shown that the design of the seat is of great importance to the biomechanical protective effect of the seat belt. A simple redesign of a conventional seat is proposed. Comparative sled tests with a new seat design and with a conventional seat are performed. The effects of a webbing-locking B-pillar loop and of an automatic belt tightener are also studied. The results show that significant improvements can be obtained by simple means. Thus, with an optimized belt system, the reductions of HIC- and Si-values are found to be in the order of two thirds and one third, respectively. In addition, significant reductions of the vertical components of deceleration and the head excursion are observed. 780899. (P-77) Subcompact Vehicle Energy-Absorbing Steering Assembly Evaluation. Liad Phillips, University of California at Santa Barbara; Anil Khadilkar and Timothy Paul Egbert, Minicars, Inc.; Stephen H. Cohen and Richard M. Morgan, National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration. This paper describes the results of a 2 year study into the field accident performances of two basic designs of energy-absorbing steering assemblies. The two basic designs are the axial-collapse type of steering column used in conjunction with a shear capsule and the self-aligning energy-absorbing steering wheel mounted on a nonstrok- ing column. The study identifies major injury causation factors for these two types of steering assemblies. The analysis was performed on 161 accident cases selected for unrestrained drivers in frontal accidents in two vehicle types. 780900. (P-77) Safety Performance of Asymmetric Wind- shields. Paul C. Begeman and Albert I. King, Wayne State University; Paul Weigt, Flachglas AG DELOG-DETAG; and L. M. Patrick, Libbey-Owens-Ford. A comparative study of the safety performance of asymmetric and standard HPR windshields was con- ducted. The effect of increased interlayer thickness was also quantified. There were four different types of asymmetric windshields which had inner layer thicknesses of 0.8 to 1.5 mm and interlayer thicknesses of 0.76 and 1.14 mm. The experimental program consisted of both full scale sled tests and headform drop tests. A total of 127 vehicular impacts were carried out using a modified Volkswagen Rabbit. The test subject was a 50th percentile Part 572 anthropomorphic test device. The asymmetric windshields were found to have a lower lacerative potential than that of the standard windshield. The best TLI value of 5.2 was provided by a 0.8-0.76 mm windshield at 60 km/h. That for the standard windshield was 7.7 at the same speed. All HIC values were less than 1,000 at 48 km/h. The drop tests were designed to study head injury potential at velocities below 30 km/h at which the windshield may not fracture. The HIC value for standard windshields was found to be as high as 800 without fracture. Tempering of such windshields can increase the hazard. Non-fractured asymmetric windshields did not exhibit dangerous HIC values. 780901. (P-77) First Step to a Pedestrian Safety Car. A. Kuehnel and H. Appel, Institute of Automotive Engineering Technical University Berlin. The front end of a standard factory model passenger automobile was modified at those points with the greatest potential for inducing injuries for the purpose of reducing the primary impact of a pedestrian against the car. The modifications were performed on the geometry and the structure of the front end. Special consideration was placed on achieving a suitable design. In experimental investigations with adult and child pedestrians, loads inflicted on the bodily parts struck by standard factory model and by modified vehicles were measured and compared. It was discovered that considerable reduction of the loading was achieved with the modified vehicle upon primary impact. 780902. (P-77) The Accuracy and Usefulness of SMAC. Charles Y. Warner and Thomas R. Perl, De- partment of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT. Computer-aided crash reconstruction has become com- monplace in the automotive safety profession, primarily because of widespread distribution of software under public auspices. The SMAC (Simulation Model of Au- tomobile Collisions) program, for instance, is available through NHTSA at nominal cost. This paper exhibits some of the limitations and strengths of accident reconstruction simulations, with illustrations and emphasis drawn from the SMAC pro- gram. In particular, some coarse physical approximations used and some coding errors incurred in the formulation of SMAC are discussed, together with their respective effects on the accuracy of prediction. Revisions of the basic SMAC coding have been developed at BYU to overcome these shortcomings. Results of uncorrected and revised SMAC simulations are demonstrated by compar- ison with the physical theory. Comments regarding a new SMAC program just completed under U.S. Government contract are presented where appropriate. Conclusions and recommendations regarding the use of SMAC and other similar programs are presented. 780903. (P-77) Sled Test Comparisons of Child Restraint Performance. Barbara J. Kelleher and Michael J. Walsh, Calspan Corporation, Advanced Tech- nology Center. Child restraint performance in frontal and lateral crash simulations is presented and discussed based upon tests conducted on the Calspan HYGE acceleration sled. 122</page><page sequence="106">780904 - 780908 Differing acceleration pulses for frontal tests were used to evaluate the pulse shape effect upon the child restraint systems. Two types of three year old size ATDs were used and restraint systems were intentionally improperly installed in an effort to ascertain the potential hazard to the child occupant from improper installation. Data obtained include head excursion, head and chest triaxial accelerations, HSI and CSI values for the ATDs. High speed movie coverage produced dummy kinematic results. Results of the study allow comparisons between the effects of different pulse shapes and the effects of different ATDs on restraint performance and comparisons in dynamic performance of the ATD/restraint complex under both proper and improper system installation. FMVSS 213 and Canadian P.C. 1977-1013 dynamic performance criteria are discussed in light of the findings of this study. This work was partially funded by Consumers Union of the U.S. and Consumer and Corporate Affairs - Canada. 780904. (P-77) Protection of Child Occupants in Auto- mobile Crashes. John W. Melvin and Richard L. Stalnaker, Biomechanics Department, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan; and Dinesh Mohan, Research De- partment, Insurance Institute for Highway Safe- ty- Detailed investigations of automobile crashes in which children under 10 years old were passengers were carried out. The purpose of this study was to investigate the injury patterns of restrained and unrestrained children and to assess the performance of child restraint systems in real world crashes. Crashes which occurred mainly in Washtenaw and Oakland counties of the state of Mich- igan were surveyed. A total of 348 vehicle crashes involving 494 children less than 10 years old were identified. Forty eight crashes involving 63 children were selected for in-depth investigation. 37% of the children in the investigated cases were restrained by an adult lap belt or a child restraint. It was found that only 4.7% of the children in the overall sample were restrained. Both adult seat belts and child restraints (when used) were found to be effective in reducing injuries in crashes. Head and facial injuries were found to be the most common form of injury to children. The vehicle interior contact points which produced some of these injuries were not covered by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 201 on occupant protection in interior impact, which specifies requirements for padded instrument panels and some other interior components. 780905. (P-78) Salting Practices - Trends and Issues. Donald H. Swets, P.E., Director Region V American Public Works Association, Dir. Public Works, Kalamazoo, Mich. The use of salt (sodium chloride) as a deicing agent in the winter maintenance of streets and highways is an indispensible tool for road agencies to assure the safety of the motoring public. There does not appear to be a cost effective substitute for salt. This consequently adds a dimension to the corrosive environment in which vehicles must operate, and thus presents a challenge to the automotive designer. 780906. (P-78) Winter Maintenance Practice and Re- search in Ontario. H. J. Fromm, Research and Development Division, Ministry of Transpor- tation and Communications, Ontario. Ontario upholds a high level of maintenance service on its highways during the winter months. The majority of these roads are maintained to bare pavement condition, while others are maintained to center bare condition. This paper describes the methods used to obtain this level of service under various winter conditions. Recently, environmentalists have expressed their concern over the effects of salt used for winter main- tenance on the environment. In response to this concern, Ontario has begun a research program to evaluate the effect of salt on the environment, and to find techniques for reducing the amount of salt used, while still providing the current level of service to the public. 780907. (P-78) Selection and Use of De-icing Chemicals and Abrasives in North America and Overseas. J. Hode Keyser, Ph.D., Ecole Polytechnique - Université de Montréal. This paper presents the state of the art on the selection and use of de-icing chemicals and abrasives. More specifically, it deals with: the need for de-icing chemicals and abrasives, problems associated with them, alternative solutions, factors to consider when selecting the appro- priate solution, the current practice, and the future trends in the use of chemicals. Based on a recent literature survey, the author concludes, that, even though we are on the verge of a breakthrough, until the time comes, we should be prepared to live with these chemicals for many years, and that the adverse effects due to chemical use can be minimized through the combined efforts of road and automotive engineers, especially through the application of existing knowledge. 780908. (P-78) Chemistry of the Automotive Environ- ment. Robert Baboian, Electrochemical and Corrosion Laboratory, Texas Instruments In- corporated, Attleboro, Mass. The interaction of our natural elements such as rain, snow and humidity, with chemicals introduced to the envi- ronment, provides a complex chemistry which is one of the most corrosive in North America. The chemistry of this environment and its relevancy to automotive corro- sion, forms the basis of this paper. An understanding of this chemistry is necessary in order to conduct meaningful corrosion tests and reduce degradation of automobiles. 1978 SA E Transactions 123</page><page sequence="107">780909 - 780920 780909. (P-78) Fundamental Mechanisms of Automobile Corrosion. V. Hospadaruk, Ford Motor Com- pany, Dearborn, Michigan. A brief review of the basic theory of the electrochemical corrosion of metals is presented, with emphasis given to the mixed-potential theory. Currently accepted electro- chemical corrosion mechanisms of several major forms of corrosion are reviewed. Galvanic, crevice and pitting types of corrosion are considered. The presently held theories on the atmospheric corrosion of steel is also discussed. 780910. (P-78) Automotive Corrosion Testing. J. D. Palmer, BSc, P.Eng. J.D. Palmer Associates Engineering Ltd. London, Ontario, Canada. The State-Of-The-Art of automotive corrosion testing is reviewed with particular emphasis on testing related to the exterior environment. The generally poor correlation of laboratory tests with field performance is reviewed and the factors affecting both laboratory and field tests are discussed. Recommendations for the conduct of field tests are presented. 780913. (P-78) Fundamentals of Corrosion Protection by Organic Coatings. A. G. Smith and R. A. Dickie, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan. An overview of the principal factors involved in the initiation and propagation of the corrosion of painted steel is presented. One of the major protective functions of the paint system is to act as a barrier to electrolyte; corrosion begins at sites where penetration of electrolyte has occurred. Loss of paint adhesion, caused in most cases by cathodically produced alkali, results in the spread of corrosion. Improved corrosion protection can be obtained by use of alkali-resistant paint binder resins. Corrosion inhibitive pigments can improve performance by slowing the overall corrosion rate; conversion coatings can slow the lateral spread of alkali attack. 1978 SA E Transactions 780914. (P-78) A Primer - Automotive Finishing and Corrosion Protection. William E. Tudor, Pontiac Motor Division, General Motors Corporation.

Arthur W. Bryant, Ford Motor Company. To aid in avoiding the corrosive elements of the envi- ronment, the designer of sheet metal body panels should consider principles which provide optimal drainage and access for the application of protective coatings. Major vehicle body components are considered individually or in closely related pairs such as door inner and outer panels. The general guidelines for preferred construction of drain holes, shingling, shielding and access for material appli- cation are outlined for each major component. 1978 SA E Transactions 780917. (P-78) Corrosion Behavior in Automotive Trim Applications. L. S. Redmerski, Colt Industries, Crucible Research Center, Pittsburgh, PA. This paper describes the performance of stainless steels, stainless clad aluminum, and anodized aluminum as automotive trim materials. As the corrosivity of the road environment has increased usage of deicing salts, and a desire to improve auto body life has materialized, improved stainless steel trim systems have been developed to provide improved trim performance. These systems have included the use of new surface finishing methods, the development of Type 434 stainless utilizing a molyb- denum addition for improved corrosion resistance, and the development of a stainless clad aluminum bi-metal trim system to minimize galvanic auto body corrosion. These developments have utilized extensive testing pro- grams in automotive service which are described in this paper. Examples are also given of wheelcover and windshield wiper applications where mechanical property and surface finish capabilities are also important consid- erations. 780919.

Basic corrosion mechanisms are described and related to specific com- ponent failures. The role of ethylene glycol base inhibited coolants is discussed and the real world of consumer practices and service problems is described. Conclusions are developed which suggest viable approaches to further improvements in cooling system performance and relia- bility. 1978 SA E Transactions 780920. (P-78) Corrosion Considerations in Design of Automotive Fuel Systems. D. J. Bologna and H. T. Page, Chrysler Corporation Detroit, Mich- igan. Metals, plastics, and rubber components are used effec- tively in the fuel system. This paper presents some of the material limitations and corrective measures required to minimize corrosion or materials degradation. For exam- ple, the use of zinc chromáte coating, petroleum base coating, and/or polyurethane foam barriers may be required to minimize the effects of road de-icing salt and mud. Fuel tank electrical connections may require sealed connections and the use of water resistant grease. Zinc coated armor wire protection of the metal fuel lines and 124</page><page sequence="108">780921 -780933 optimum material selection of the rubber components of the fuel lines are also discussed. New legislative proposals to add increasing amounts of alcohols to gasoline may dictate further materials design optimizations as suggested by a review of some selected references dealing with this subject. 780921. (P-78) Materials, Design and Corrosion Effects on Exhaust-System Life. William R. Patterson, Walker Manufacturing Company, Division of Tenneco Automotive Engineering &amp; Research Center, Grass Lake, Michigan. A description is given of contemporary exhaust-system metal-deteriorating conditions, and their relation to exhaust component failure mode and likelihood, based on materials and design considerations. Exhaust-component durability is discussed, and specific failure sites and metal corrosion-oxidation conditions identified. Localized, external corrosion is shown to be an important source of metal-failure in exhaust-system components. Internal, muffler-condensate corrosion is likely to produce the most rapid rate of metal-thickness decrease, and component failure. The effect of the catalytic convertor on internal corrosion is discussed. Exhaust-component steels' corrosion oxidation resis- tance depends both on the metallic coating, and the internal and external exhaust-system operating environ- ment. Traditional steel usage in exhaust-systems may change, due to current and future requirements of reduced-weight and/or extended life. 1978 SA E Transactions 780924. (P-78) Electrical Component Corrosion Preven- tion. M. Michael Jones and Edward E. Welker, Delco Remy Division, Anderson, Indiana. Responsive design of automotive electrical components requires a knowledge of the probable detrimental effects of corrosion. Volumes of material exist that discuss corrosion. The varied types of corrosion and the frequent simultaneous presence of several types prevent the specifying of "one solution" for each specific corrosion problem. This paper is intended to inform the designer of the types of corrosion and to offer various preventative measures to consider during the design stage. 780925. (P-78) Corrosion in Integrated Electronics. Eugene Greenstein, Ford Motor Company, Electrical and Electronics Division. A review of corrosion mechanisms in integrated elec- tronics is presented. For metallization corrosion to occur, moisture and impurities such as Na, K or CI must be present to form an electrolytic cell. The aluminum metallization of Integrated Circuits must be protected from the environment to prevent corrosion from occur- ring. Thick Film Hybrid circuits, besides being suscep- table to IC corrosion mechanisms, also can fail due to dendrite formation causing shorting between gold or silver conductors that are exposed to moisture and halogen impurities. 780930. Electrical Observation of Lubricant Film Between a Cam and a Lifter of an OHV Engine. Kiyoshi Ninomiya, Masuhiko Kawamura and Kenji Fujita, Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Labs., Inc. (Nagoya/Japan). The paper describes an electrical method to observe formation and break down of a lubricant film between a cam and a lifter through electrical voltage (conductivity) variation. Break down of the lubricant film increased with decreasing oil viscosity, increasing valve spring load and growth of pits on the lifter surface. The process of film formation during running-in and cold start was also studied. A computer-aided data processing system was devel- oped to obtain the relations between the cam angle and the average electrical voltage across the lubricant film. 780931. The Sequence IID Engine Oil Test. John J. Rodgers and Richard H. Kabel, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. The ASTM Sequence IIC test was established to evaluate the rust and corrosion protection provided by gasoline engine oils. It is one of the several tests currently used to define SE-quality engine oils. The test utilizes a 1967, 7.0 L Oldsmobile engine which is no longer available. This paper describes the program to replace this engine with a 1978, 5.7 L Oldsmobile engine. The new test called Sequence IID also evaluates engine oil rust and corrosion protection, and it correlates with both Sequence IIC engine test and passenger car short-trip test results. 780932. Evaluation of Dispersancy by Analytical Methods. F. L. Badiali, F. Berti and A. A. Cassiani Ingoni, Petroleum Products Dept., Assoreni (Milan/ Italy); and G. Pusateri, Agip Petroli (Rome/ Italy). Test severity, inhibition and oil discrepancy: these are factors which influence the formation of sludge and the extent of its settling in the engine. By appropriate used-oil analyses it is possible to calculate indices of the oil's performance which are largely independent of the type of engine used and the test procedure followed. The ASTM D 893 test procedure is inapplicable to a large number of modern motor oils. An alternative method based on the filtration of used oils over membrane filters has been of great help in recent years. However, a newly developed photometric method seems promising in overcoming most present analytical difficulties. The indices obtained from used-oil analyses can become the only feasible test method in the development of long drain oils. 780933. Projections of Motor Vehicle Fuel Demand and 125</page><page sequence="109">780934 - 780938 Emissions. Edward N. Cantwell, Jr., Eugene N. Castellano, Jr. and John M. Pierrard, Petroleum Laboratory, E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). Methodologies were developed and applied to project (1) motor vehicle fuel demand, (2) air quality improvements through emission reductions, and (3) the effect of stringent vehicle emission controls on energy consumption. Motor gasoline demand for both the U.S. and Canada is projected to peak about 1980 at about 2% above the current level, followed by a gradual decrease through 1990. However, total U.S. motor fuel use will increase through 1990 due to increasing diesel fuel demand. Ozone air quality projected from HC and NOx emissions shows more improvement resulting from control of other sources than from further tightening of vehicle emission stan- dards. Vehicle emission standards significantly more stringent than the 1975 Canadian level increase energy consumption by as much as 20% at the 1981 U.S. level. Maintenance of the current emission standards in the U.S. could allow sufficient future improvements in gasoline consumption to cause total motor fuel use to decrease after 1982. 1978 SA E Transactions 780934. Urban Traffic, Fuel Economy and Emissions - Consistency of Various Measurements. Leonard Evans, Traffic Science Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren MI. A number of studies of the effect of traffic conditions on fuel consumption and emissions are reviewed. A model based on driving vehicles in traffic is described in which the fuel consumption of a vehicle in urban traffic is expressed as a simple function of trip speed. Data from a variety of sources, including additional field data, detailed computer simulation, the same vehicle tested on different fixed urban driving schedules, and small segments of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) have been all shown to fit the model. A similar model of HC emissions as a simple function of trip speed is derived from analyzing small segments of FTP data. Data from a variety of sources, including published EPA relations, detailed computer simulation, and dynamometer replication of street data have been all shown to fit this model. No simple models were found for CO and NOx. In general, it is found that urban traffic, despite its seemingly disorganized appear- ance, yields rather consistent relations between fuel consumption and average speed, and between HC and average speed. 1978 SA E Transactions 780935. The Effects of Technology on Automobile Fuel Economy Under Canadian Conditions. A. C. S. Hayden, Canadian Combustion Research Lab. Fuel economy degrades significantly as ambient temper- ature decreases. Diesel, stratified charge, lean burn and turbocharged-knock-limited engined automobiles show significantly less degradation in fuel economy and emissions than do conventionally-carbureted, catalyst- equipped automobiles. In particular, the new diesel automobiles offer large benefits in weight-normalized fuel economy and emissions for the wide temperature range found in Canada's climate. 780936. A Comparative Analysis of the Thermal Effi- ciency of 1977 and 1978 Model Year Vehicles Under Chassis Dynamometer Conditions. F. Peter Hutchins and James M. Kranig, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Comparison of vehicle thermal efficiency and engine load factor for 1977 and 1978 model year certification vehicles shows low correlation. At any load factor, the spread in thermal efficiencies was on the order of 2 to 1. These facts suggest that, with existing technologies, vehicle manu- facturers can realize a significant improvement in fuel economy through better matching of engines (specific fuel consumption), transmissions and final drive ratios to vehicle power requirements. 780937. TFC/IW. Doran K. Samples and Richard C. Wiquist, Chrysler Corp. TFC/IW, total fuel consumption divided by inertia (test) weight is a useful concept in analyzing the total or composite fuel economy generated in thousands of tests using the carbon balance technique in EPA Federal Test Procedure and Highway Driving Cycle. TFC/IW is a measure of drive train efficiency that requires no addi- tional complicating assumptions. It is applicable to one test or a fleet representing many tests. 1978 SA E Transactions 780938. A Fuel Economy Measurement Dilemma - Cer- tification Testing vs. Customer Driving. Craig Marks, Executive Assistant to the Vice Presi- dent, Engineering Staff, General Motors Cor- poration. Many factors can be cited which produce differences between the fuel economy values obtained during the exhaust emission certification process and the economy experienced by car owners. Admittedly, all laboratory tests are compromised by many assumptions, approxi- mations, and practical test limitations. The main value of the EPA test procedure is that it has provided a uniform test method for all manufacturers which produces vast amounts of comparative fuel economy information. Changes to the procedure to make it more "represen- tative" have reduced its usefulness for comparisons to previous years. The concept of labeling cars with a "representative" fuel economy value is certain to result in some customer misinformation and dissatisfaction. At best, current labeling methods can be expected to indicate real vehicle differences only when label values differ by more than 2 mi/gal (0.85 km/1). Furthermore, wide variations in customer fuel economy (ranging up to 15 mi/gal) for the same EPA label value are bound to make some people 126</page><page sequence="110">780939 - 780943 regard the label values as misleading. Changes in new car fuel economy have a significant impact upon future fuel demand projections. A stable fuel economy measurement procedure and an understanding of the factors which relate certification to average customer economy are needed to reduce the uncertainties in such a projection. 780939. ASTM Study of Fluidity of Automotive Gear Oils at Low Temperatures. H. F. Hitchcox, Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Company, Linden, N.J.; and D. L. Powell, AutoResearch Labo- ratories, Inc., Chicago, Illinois. This paper reviews the work of ASTM Research and Development Division VII during 1973-77 related to the low-temperature flow characteristics of automotive gear oils. Phase I showed that the Canadian channel point test was superior to the U.S.A. method in operability and discrimination between oils, although some modifications to the Canadian method were recommended. Phase II concerned establishing reference oils based on tests in cold full-scale axles, and using these reference oils to evaluate laboratory tests for determining and specifying cold fluidity of gear oils. Brookfield viscosity proved most suitable, with channel point and pour point being much less favorable. 1978 SA E Transactions 780940. Factors That Influence the Precision of Brook- field Viscometry of Automotive Lubricant Fluids. J. F. Gyer, Mobil Research and Development Corp. This paper summarizes and analyzes data that have led to a proposed generalized Brookfield procedure for meas- uring the low temperature, low shear rate viscosity of automotive lubricant fluids. The data were collected between 1974 and 1977 by ASTM Committee D-2, Research and Development Division VII, Brookfield Viscometry Task Force in cooperation with the Institute of Petroleum, the Groupement Française de Coordina- tion, and the National Research Council of Canada. The sources of error in the generalized Brookfield procedure are examined in detail. A system based on the known viscosity-temperature function of Newtonian reference fluids is proposed for estimating error magnitudes from existing cooperative data. Application of these estimated error magnitudes to engine and gear oil data produced repeatability and reproducibility estimates that are functions of viscometer rpm for non-Newtonian products. Viscometer rpm is shown to be a critical test parameter at low temperature. RPM sensitivity is largely due to the Brookfield viscom- eter's ability to sense the strength of the wax or wax-additive gels that exist below the cloud point. The physical and rhéologie reasons for this sensitivity are outlined. This analysis of cooperative data results in a signif- icant advance in the understanding of the viscometry of automotive lubricant fluids at low temperature. It is published primarily as an information report. At this writing, the precision estimates and the generalized Brookfield method are being circulated for approval by the cooperating organizations. 1978 SA E Transactions 780941. Assessment of the Low Temperature Brookfield Viscosity of Lubricants by a New Liquid Bath Method. André Vidal, Compagnie Française de Raffinage, Total Technique, Centre de Recher- ches. Presently, the different methods available to measure the viscosity of fluids at low temperature with the Brookfield viscometer do not give entire satisfaction because of their low precision. A working group set up by the Technical Committee "Transmission Lubricants" (T.L.T.C.) of Groupement Français de Coordination (G.F.C.), member of C.E.C., ran different tests which led to the proposal of a new method. This new procedure for measuring the Brookfield viscosities includes the following improve- ments: - shortened test duration - better precision, and was adopted by C.E.C, as tentative method under the number CEC L18-T76. 1978 SAE Transactions 780942.

The problems facing the diesel today, particularly from a combustion point of view, are reviewed and areas for research effort are highlighted. 780943. Parametric Simulation of Significant Design and Operating Alternatives Affecting the Fuel Econ- omy and Emissions of Spark-Ignited Engines. J. M. Novak and P. N. Blumberg, Ford Motor Company. A fundamental thermodynamic model of the complete spark-ignited, homogeneous charge engine cycle has been used in several parametric analyses to predict the effects of engine design and operating alternatives on fuel consumption and emissions of NOx and unburned hydro- carbons (HC). The simulation includes sub-models for wall heat transfer, NOx and HC emissions, and the engine breathing processes. This work demonstrates the power and utility of a comprehensive engine simulation by presenting several independent parametric studies that were carried out in response to genuine engine design and/or operating strategy questions. Included in this compilation are the effects of cycle heat loss, exhaust port heat loss, combustion duration, and charge dilution (EGR and/or lean air-fuel ratio). In addition, the influence of 127</page><page sequence="111">780944 - 780949 the design variables associated with bore-stroke ratio, intake and exhaust valve lift, and cam timing are considered. Actual engine data is shown to enhance and lend validity to the analytical results when appropriate. 1978 SA E Transactions 780944. Manifold Fuel Film Effects in an SI Engine. I. W. Kay, United Technologies Research Center, United Technologies Corp., East Hartford, CT. A test program was conducted with a carbureted 2.3-liter engine in which a map of engine operating conditions over which intake manifold wall films of appreciable mag- nitude exist was defined on the basis of visual obser- vations. It was found that the largest maldistributions of fuel/air ratio among the four cylinders of the engine occurred during operation at conditions characterized by the presence of extensive fuel puddles on the intake manifold floor. However, it was also found that while the intake manifold fuel films and puddles could essentially be eliminated by heating the manifold floor, the fuel/air ratio distributions among cylinders under such conditions were virtually identical to those measured under conven- tional operating conditions. On the basis of these data, it was concluded that the steady-state distribution of fuel among the cylinders was not affected by the presence of liquid films or puddles within the intake manifold but rather that the resulting maldistributions were attributable to other charge stratification effects in the intake flow process. 780945. The Effect of Fuel Injection on NOx Emissions and Undesirable Combustion for Hydrogen-Fu- eled Piston Engines. H. S. Homan, P. C. T. deBoer and W. J. McLean, Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY. Direct cylinder injection for hydrogen-fueled piston engines was studied experimentally with an ASTM-CFR engine. An injection scheme was devised for which the combustion occurs during the period of hydrogen injec- tion so that little unburned hydrogen accumulates in the cylinder. This scheme should preclude flashback and preignition, and lowers the rate of cylinder pressure rise to acceptable levels. The potential of hydrogen as a low pollution fuel was investigated by comparing the NOx emissions from the same engine operated on hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuel. NOx emissions for hydrogen are very low provided the equivalence ratio is less than 0.5, and provided the hydrogen and air are well mixed. For equivalence ratios greater than 0.5, NOx emissions for hydrogen fuel were higher than for hydrocarbon fuel. With hydrogen injection, indicated mean effective pres- sure was varied between 0.07 MPa and 0.78 MPa without intake air throttling. Indicated efficiencies higher than 40% were achieved for part-load equivalence ratios, near 0.3. The timing of hydrogen injection has a significant effect on NOx emissions. 780947. The Incidence of Vehicle Misfueling in Major Cities in Canada. G. W. Taylor, N. D. Lea &amp; Associates Ltd. The paper presents the results of a gas station survey in the Spring of 1978 which attempted to estimate the incidence of the misfueling of vehicles. Misfueling was defined as the use of leaded gasoline in cars designed to use unleaded gasoline. The data was collected by on-site observers in seven major Canadian cities. In addition to fuel type used, information on the frequency of pump nozzle substitution and fuel inlet tampering are compiled and presented. Conclusions on the importance of this problem in the control of emissions from cars are developed. 780948. Performance of Late Model Cars with Gasoline- Methanol Fuel. G. Publow, General Motors of Canada Ltd.; and L. Grinberg, Shell Canada Ltd. A test program has been completed to determine how the incorporation of 15% methanol in gasoline affects the driveability, exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of three 1978 model passenger cars. The study has shown that use of methanol containing fuel deteriorates the driveability of the cars to what is considered to be an unacceptable performance by the present standards. The exhaust emissions are not significantly affected, except for a moderate reduction in the carbon monoxide levels. The volumetric fuel consumption, however, is increased appreciably. Relatively simple adjustments to the carburetor and ignition timing can restore the driveability to an accept- able level for operation with or without methanol. These adjustments, however, fail to restore the fuel consumption to its original level and may result in the escalation of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The in- crease in emissions is even more pronounced when the modified car is reverted back to operation with gasoline. 1978 SA E Transactions 780949. The Effects of Refinery Gasoline Components on Road Octane Quality. R. E. Burtner, Sun Group; and W. E. Morris, E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). Thirty-five unleaded and nineteen leaded gasoline blends were tested for road octane rating in a fleet of nine unleaded cars or seven leaded cars as applicable. These blends were prepared to cover a wide range of compo- sition while meeting octane targets and volatility speci- fications. Road octane results were closely related to (R + M)/2 for unleaded gasolines but Motor octane was more important than Research for leaded gasolines. The effects of component composition on deviations from road octane correlations were small. Unleaded component effects not predicted by labo- ratory octane number were obtained in a single manual transmission car; those effects are attributed to octane distribution over the gasoline boiling range. 1978 SA E Transactions 128</page><page sequence="112">780950 - 780954 780950. A Review of Automotive Emission Control Pro- grams Around the World. G. W. Taylor, N.D. Lea &amp; Associates Ltd. Emission control programs for automobiles have now been in existence for almost two decades in some jurisdictions. In addition, the approach to regulation and enforcement varies from country to country thus creating a large array of policy alternatives which can be evaluated. This paper attempts to review the strengths and weaknesses of the major control programs around the world and evaluate the costs and effectiveness of the existing standards in reducing emission levels. The data that forms the basis for this paper is from an OECD report on the subject prepared by the author in 1977 and contains data from the ECE, Japanese, US, Canadian, Swedish and Australian automotive emission control programs. A method of comparing the major test standards is presented in order that the standards can be quantitatively and qualitatively related to each other. 1978 SA E Transactions 780951. Synthesized Lubricants Provide Exceptional Extended Drain Passenger Car Performance. D. B. Barton and J. A. Murphy, Mobil Research and Development Corp.; and K. W. Gardner, Mobil Oil Corp., Technical Service Labs. Studies have been conducted which illustrate the excellent overall performance of a synthesized passenger car engine oil during greatly extended drain intervals. These studies were conducted primarily with automobiles manufactured in the U.S. and with typical U.S. service. Supporting data are presented in areas of engine cleanliness, engine wear, and lubricant stability from several types of service conditions including heavy duty taxicab and police car operations as well as typical everyday consumer driving. Information is also provided from a high mileage test using the EPA durability cycle. These field test results correlate well with extended duration API SE sequence data. 780952. Extended Drain Passenger Car Engine Oils. L. R. Carey, W. H. Stover and D. W. Murray, Imperial Oil Ltd., Research Department. The trend to longer oil drain intervals for passenger cars has hastened in the last few years. Most earlier studies on the effects of extended drains on oil and engine per- formance were conducted prior to 1973 when significant engine modifications were made to reduce exhaust emissions. This paper describes several taxi and other road tests, supplemented by laboratory programs, conducted since 1973. The total field program included approxi- mately 225 cars over sixteen million kilometers. All of the work reported is with 5 W and 10W multigrade engine oils. Taxi test results have shown sludge build-up and oil thickening to be the most significant failure modes as drains are extended beyond approximately 12 000 km. This occurs even with oils giving excellent Sequence IIIC and VC results. Oil thickening and particularly engine sludge and filter plugging were more severe in winter driving and with leaded gasoline. With conventional 5W multigrade SE oils, engine wear, particularly in the cam and lifter region, was found to be very dependent on test conditions and was severe in some. However, with extended drain additive technology, excellent overall performance has been demonstrated with 5W30 engine oils at 24 000 km oil drains under summer driving conditions. Used oil corrosivi ty, measured in the labo- ratory, and engine wear were found to be relatively independent of used oil acidity measured by Total Acid Number (TAN). In terms of oil thickening, results from a low temperature starting/crankability program with fresh and used oils suggested that for a 100% increase in CCS viscosity, the minimum starting temperature increased by only 1-3°C. Basestock volatility was found to be critical in controlling low temperature viscosity increases at extended drains. Superior additive technology and low volatility, narrow cut basestocks were both considered necessary for adequate performance at 24 000 km oil drains. Discussion: Richard E.

Kensuke Sugiura, Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. This paper describes the recent trends in motor oils in Japan and the movement of drain interval extension. The present target proposed by Japanese car manufacturers is mostly the extension from 5,000 km to 10,000 km, that does not look "long drain" and seems to be easily met by conventional SE oils. Recently low ash-low phosphorus oils have been predominating in the market for the purpose of getting longer catalyst durability. Therefore it is our primary concern how to satisfy simultaneously the drain interval extension and low ash-low phosphorus requirements. Valve train wear is still an important item. While some conventional SE oils are deficient in wear protection, a couple of low ash-low phosphorus oils have excellent antiwear performance. 780954.

Quillian, Jr., U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Laboratory, Southwest Research Institute; and H. E. McCormick, Ramsey Corporation, Piston Ring Division of TRW Inc. The Military is interested in the development of multisea- sonal extended-drain crankcase lubricants for the diesel- powered tactical fleet. Such lubricants offer potentially large savings in lubricant, logistics, and man-power costs plus they can greatly improve overall fleet readiness. To this end, a series of studies have been examining varying lubricant formulations and engine modifications to iden- 129</page><page sequence="113">780955 - 780962 tify approaches to extended-drain intervals. Both con- ventional and synthetic lubricants are being evaluated for future tactical fleet applications. In addition, mechanical modifications to the engine which reduce the oil degra- dation rates are being studied. This paper not only outlines some of the important findings but also indicates the future direction of this activity. 780955. Antioxidant Decay in Engine Oils During Lab- oratory Tests and Long Drain Interval Service. Stefan Korcek, Lee R. Mahoney, Milton D. Johnson and Sylvia Hoffman, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A new method for the determination of antioxidant capacity in lubricants has been utilized for the analyses of new and used engine oil samples. The results derived from these analyses were used for monitoring the antioxidant decay during laboratory and long drain fleet testing and in various correlation studies. The application of the method provided new insights into the nature of the oxidative deterioration of engine oils as a function of type and initial concentration of antioxidant additives, of type of base oil and of test or engine severity.

Hanson and L. Hunter, Research and Development Dept., Gulf Canada Ltd. (Ontario/Canada). A line of high quality multigrade diesel engine oils suitable for long drain applications has been developed using hydrotreated basestock. Laboratory and engine dyna- mometer tests indicated that lubricating oils using hydro- treated basestock have superior control of diesel piston deposits and oxidative viscosity increase. Excellent per- formance of multigrade diesel engine oils using both hydrotreated and solvent refined basestock over extended oil change intervals has been demonstrated in extensive field trials. Cold weather benefits for multigrade diesel engine oils were defined by cold room studies and outdoor trials. 780958. Experiences with Extended Oil Drain Intervals in Diesel Truck Engines. G. W. Holmes and R. Overton, Imperial Oil Limited. This paper examines the benefits and problems associated with extended oil drain intervals in diesel truck engines. Performance comparisons were made on two-drain pe- riods in three different engines using both mono and multi grade oils. Three typical customer operations were also monitored. Laboratory evaluations were made on typical and severely stressed used oils. Oil filter life and durability were assessed. The economics of extending oil and filter change intervals are reviewed. Efficient combustion and well-filtered air are essential. Potential operational problems, filter durability and economics suggest 40 000 km as being the maximum change interval even under most optimum conditions. 780959. Data Acquisition System for Vehicle Fuel Econ- omy Measurement. Morton S. Balban and H. O. Williams, Rockwell International. Acquiring and recording real-world vehicle operating and environmental conditions is becoming increasingly im- portant for determining techniques to reduce fuel con- sumption and other operating costs. The operational characteristics of vehicles has been the object of consid- erable study, which has included component and vehicle tests under controlled conditions, and computer simu- lation. The selective gathering of pertinent information under in-service conditions has heretofore not been practicable nor reliable. This paper describes the use of Rockwell International's Tripmastertm on-board Instru- mentation System applied to obtaining this information for use in the DOT/SAE Fuel Economy measurement study. 780960. On-Board Processing for Truck/Bus Fuel Econ- omy and Operational Data Acquisition. Ruth A. Hunter, U.S. Department of Transportation, Transportation Systems Center; Jeanne M. Baker and John E. Juhasz, Rockwell Interna- tional. The use of an on-board microprocessor to acquire data on truck and bus performance during in-service operation enables the information transmitted by measurement sensors to be examined, processed, compacted or aggre- gated, and stored in memory by the on-board computer software. The system development requires a careful balance of the tradeoffs between hardware and software concepts which is quite different from considerations applied with normal "laboratory" type data acquisition systems. 780961. Power Train Selection for Optimum Performance and Efficiency. J. W. Schmidt and R. L. Kesler, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motors Corporation. Today's commercial transport service vehicle owner is being confronted with increasingly complex problems in his vehicle operation. As a means of solving one of his problems, methods of evaluating power train components and their effect on obtaining optimum vehicle perform- ance and efficiency have been developed. Vehicle voca- tion variables and the different types of power trains and power components have been analyzed. Utilization of the techniques described should bring the vehicle engineer closer to providing an optimum match of vehicle, engine, transmission, axle, and tires for a given vocation. 780962.

Tempe, Engine Design and Materials Engineering Department, Powertrain Product Engineering Office, Ford Motor Company. Legislated fuel economy standards have necessitated investigations to determine the cost-effectiveness of "low-friction" engine lubricants to assist in attaining these goals. Preliminary testing indicated friction reduction engine oil additives may provide potentially significant improvements in fuel economy over conventional and low viscosity engine oils. Vehicle test programs were under- taken to evaluate the effects of molybdenum disulfide, graphite and soluble additives on fuel economy, engine cleanliness and wear, as well as exhaust emission levels and engine and emission component durability. The significant fuel economy improvements and effects on all aforementioned variables are detailed in the paper. 1978 SA E Transactions 780964. Lean Mixture Running of the Spark Ignition Engine by the Generation of a Vortex System within the Intake. G. G. Lucas and M. Brunt, Loughborough Univ. of Technology; and S. Petrovic, Univ. of Belgrade. Tests on a single-cylinder engine have shown that the flame speed and lean extinction limit may be increased by the fitment of a "vortex generator" in the engine intake. This consists of a nest of delta wings which generates a vortex system in the inlet air flow. The results show that this vortex generator should be of variable geometry and replace the conventional throttle. The main instrumentation on the engine consists of a flame logger which accepts amplified signals from ionisa- tion probes set in the engine combustion chamber. The logger is gated to count those flames which travel across the combustion chamber during a set crank angle period. Information from this instrumentation is presented in the form of graphs describing the effect of vortex generator blockage ratio, mixture strength, engine speed, load and spark timing upon the percentage number of flames which cross the chamber and apparent flame speed. 780965. Rotary Combustion Engine Hydrocarbon Source Studies. Robert J. Bayer, Stephen F. DeNagel and John C. Steiner, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. In an effort to improve the trade-off between fuel economy and emissions in the rotary combustion engine, research was undertaken to provide a better understand- ing of the sources of unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust. Flame photography was used in conjunction with extensive time-resolved exhaust gas sampling. Examina- tions were made of the effects of air-fuel ratio, engine load, residual gas, and engine speed on combustion and hydrocarbon emissions using the two experimental tech- niques. These studies identified two major sources of hydrocarbon emissions: flame extinction and, not sur- prisingly, apex seal leakage. Conclusions were the following: (1) at lean air-fuel ratios (i.e., &gt;18.0 to 1), flame extinction in the trailing portion of the chamber was a major source of exhaust hydrocarbons, and (2) at richer air-fuel ratios (i.e., &lt; 16.5 to 1), apex seal leakage was a major source of exhaust hydrocarbons. 1978 SA E Transactions 780966. The Influence of Operating Variables and Prechamber Size on Combustion in a Prechamber Stratified-Charge Engine. John C. Wall, Chevron Research Co.; and John B. Heywood, Mas- sachusetts Inst, of Technology. This paper describes the results of experimental and computer simulation studies of the combustion process in the prechamber three-valve stratified-charge engine. Prechamber and main-chamber pressure data and matched computer simulation calculations are used to determine the effects of variations in overall air/fuel ratio, engine speed and load, and prechamber volume and orifice diameter on the parameters which define the combustion process (spark advance for optimum torque, ignition delay, combustion duration), on cylinder pressure diagrams (mean main-chamber pressure, mean pressure difference across the orifice, and cycle-by-cycle pressure fluctuations) and on exhaust emissions. General correlations are derived from the data for the shape of the combustion rate profile and the extent of the combustion duration. 780967. An Engine Diagnostic Package (EDPAC) - Software for Analyzing Cylinder Pressure- Time Data. Michael B. Young and John H. Lienesch, Engine Research Dept., General Mo- tors Research Laboratories. Measurements of engine cylinder pressure have become routine at the General Motors Research Laboratories. EDPAC, an Engine Diagnostic Package, was designed and developed to process these data automatically from single- and multi-cylinder engines in order to provide engine performance and combustion information. EDPAC consists of several self-contained, independent software modules, each having a different analysis function. These include engine performance calculations, pressure-volume graphics, engine simulation for residual gas estimates, and heat release analysis. After each module is executed, computed results are stored auto- matically, providing input to subsequent software modules as well as providing a data base for future interrogation. Routine use of EDPAC to process pressure data results in reductions of costs, effort, and turn-around times. A data base containing performance, emissions, and combustion data is established automatically. 780968. Engine Combustion at Large Bore-to-Stroke Ratios. Robert M. Siewert, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. 131</page><page sequence="115">780969 - 780972 The effect of bore-to-stroke ratio (B/S) on indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) and emissions of a gasoline-fueled, spark-ignited, single-cylinder engine was studied while holding compression ratio and bore diam- eter constant. As B/S was increased from 1.1 to 3.3, both ISFC and hydrocarbon emissions increased significantly. Increased cylinder heat loss and, to a lesser extent, increased combustion duration were the principal causes of the ISFC increase. Increased surface-to-volume ratio was the principal cause of the increase in hydrocarbon emissions. The influence of combustion chamber modi- fications on these effects was investigated.

Lavoie, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Results from a numerical investigation of one-dimen- sional, laminar flame quenching with constant and time-dependent pressure variations are reported herein. A description of flame quenching and post-flame oxidation processes for the global reaction A + B - &gt; C is obtained from a solution of a simplified form of the non-linear conservation of mass, momentum and energy equations in a planar flow field. These equations were reduced to finite difference form and the time-dependent pressure was input via either an integrated form of the energy equation or a third-order polynomial law. Numerical calculations were performed at constant pressure, combustion bomb- type conditions and under rapid decompression during quenching. One-dimensional head-on quenching dis- tances, hydrocarbon concentration levels and gas prop- erties were obtained for a variety of stoichiometric values in a propane/air-type mixture. Results presented indicate that the quenching distance is primarily controlled by the thermal conduction process; however, residual hydro- carbon levels are intimately related to post-quenching diffusion, oxidation kinetics and the thermodynamic cycle during which they occur. 1978 SA E Transactions 780970. Spectroscopic Investigation of Hydroxy! Radical Formation in the End Gases of a Spark-Ignited Engine Utilizing a Dye Laser. Duane L. Abata, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Michigan Tech- nological Univ., Houghton, MI; Phil S. Myers and Otto A. Uyehara, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI. This investigation dealt with the experimental determi- nation of a select chemical specie - the hydroxyl radical - present in the non-flamed end gases ahead of the flame front in a spark-ignited engine operating under conditions of both normal and knocking combustion. Concentration measurements of the hydroxyl radical present in the end gases were obtained with the technique of resonance absorption spectroscopy utilizing a broadband-output, frequency-tunable, flashlamp-pumped, organic-dye laser. The dye laser and a photographic spectrometer were placed on opposite sides of a single cylinder research engine and the combustion chamber of the engine was fitted with quartz windows that allowed the dye-laser light pulse to pass through the end gas region and into the spectrometer. The dye laser was pulsed once at a present crankangle during the combustion cycle recording the 22+-2n electronic transition absorption spectrum on film. The absorption technique allowed hydroxyl radical con- centration measurements within the range of 6.0 X 10~10 to 1.5 X KT8 moles/cc which was sufficient to measure the hydroxyl radical in the non-inflamed end gases several degrees ahead of the advancing flame front. 1978 SA E Transactions 780971. A Statistical Approach to Determining the Effects of Speed, Load, Oil and Coolant Temperature on Diesel Engine Specific Fuel Consumption. Magdi Yousry, John H. Johnson and Sudhakar M. Pandit, Michigan Technological Univ. Experimental Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) data are presented for two engines as a function of engine speed, load, outlet coolant temperature and inlet oil temperature. The engines used in the study were the Cummins VT-903 (turbocharged) and the Caterpillar 3208, both being direct-injection and four-cycle. The data were taken for the Cat 3208 engine using a fractional factorial statistical method which reduced the total test matrix from 256 to 64 data points. The experimental data are used in the development of BSFC regression equations as a function of load, speed, outlet coolant temperature and inlet oil temperatures. A mathematical parameter for expressing quantitatively the change of BSFC per 10° F change in coolant and oil temperature is presented. It was found that an increase in the coolant and/or oil temper- atures had the effect of reducing BSFC in both engines. This statistical regression method presented should be useful in the development of engines and their "per- formance maps". 780972. Selective Radioactive Tracers for Engine Wear Diagnosis and Filter Evaluation. Gordon W. Jones, Fram Corp., Providence, RI; Anthony J. Armini and Neil C. Schoen, Spire Corp., Bedford, MA. A method for monitoring the wear of engine parts without engine disassembly is described. Low level radiation sources implanted in the wearing surfaces serve as a tracer for material loss. Prior to engine testing, controlled wearing of an identical part determines a calibration curve relating wear depth to externally measurable radiation. The results of engine testing show that the method is useful in measuring small amounts of wear in individual engine parts such as piston rings and connecting rod bearings simultaneously without engine disassembly. These tests were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of 132</page><page sequence="116">780974 - 780977 filters in reducing engine wear. The wear measurements showed that both air and oil filters are highly effective in reducing wear throughout an engine. 1978 SA E Transactions 780974. Diesel Engine Lube Filter Life Related to Oil Chemistry. R. D. Hudgens and L. B. Feldhaus, Fleetguard, Inc. Today's diesel engine lubricating oils are highly dispersant and typically carry several pounds of solid combustion contaminant in suspension - little of which is filterable. Since the average full flow filter is capable of holding less than a pound of solids, filter life and capacity are no longer directly related. Field experience has demonstrated at least six distinct methods by which filters plug. This data indicates that filter life is simply a function of the type and amount of contaminant present in the crankcase and the oil's ability to handle or tolerate the contami- nation. However, oils differ greatly in their ability to do this. Field experience also suggests that the current API Classification tests may be inadequate in some areas to determine lubricating oils' suitability for diesel engine service. Finally, filter plugging should be looked at as a symptom of engine or oil problems, but not as a problem itself. Discussion: Z. M. Holubee, The Lubrizol Corp- 1978 SA E Transactions 780975. Report of St. Louis Truck Fuel Economy Dem- onstration. L. Kibbee, Trans Tech Enterprises; and John E. Allen, UPS. The Regular Common Carrier Conference (RCCC) representing the trucking industry and its suppliers in cooperation with and with the assistance of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the U.S. Department of Transportation conducted a demonstration of the use of a test procedure recently adopted by the RCCC and the SAE. The procedure known as "Short Term In-Service Vehicle Fuel Consumption Test Procedure - Type I" is designed to evaluate "add-on" type fuel saving devices on trucks used in the evaluation. Operational techniques of a truck operator may also be evaluated by the Type I procedure. The demonstration was a major cooperative under- taking of the trucking industry and its suppliers. Nine for-hire motor carriers, five private motor carriers and six leasing firms furnished 26 pairs of trucks, which collec- tively covered more than 12,500 miles during the two-day evaluation program. Fuel saving devices used came from 15 manufacturers plus a special lubricant furnished by a major oil company. Supervision and administration of the demonstration was done by a committee of the Regular Common Carrier Conference which was aided at the site by additional volunteers from both private and for-hire motor carriers, truck manufacturers, engine manufacturers, technical representatives of government agencies, university faculty members, and members of the trade press. The major program objective was to demonstrate the practical use of the test procedure as an effective yet simple method for evaluating in their owner operations those fuel efficient devices being offered for sale to motor carriers. The Type I test method is capable of very accurate measurement of fuel use when procedures are followed. Some of the devices tested experienced operational difficulties, causing rejection of their results in the tabulations which follow. Though the Test Committee recommends some minor changes in the data collection forms used in the procedure, the operational factors were entirely validated. Had time permitted, the Test Committee is entirely confident that the operational difficulties experienced in the testing of the devices where the data had to be rejected could have been corrected by a repeat test. The Commit- tee feels that the procedure and the method of data recording provides certain internal controls which were also demonstrated by the fact that questionable data could be identified for rejection. Many of the rejections were attributed to the fast pace of the two-day demon- stration, rather than to any shortcoming of the Type I procedure itself. The time, effort and money spent in the planning, conduct, and publicity given to the demonstration showed the very real concern of the trucking industry and its suppliers for the need to operate trucks on the highways in a manner which will conserve the nation's fuel supplies. 1978 SAE Transactions 780977. (SP-434) Investigations to Characterize the Low- Temperature-FIuidity of Polymer-Containing En- gine Oils. W. Wiemann, Institut für Erdölfors- chung; and W. J. Bartz, Technische Akademie Esslingen. Up to the present, the "W" portion of multigrade engine oils were classified only with regard to their low temper- ature startability by viscosity measurements at -18 C in the Cold Cranking Simulator. Because of the low shear rates encountered at the suction side of the oil pumps, the low temperature pumpability of the oils in the engine were not being considered. The investigations which were promoted by the DGMK were conducted to correlate the low-temperature pumpability of multigrade oils in a full-scale engine with suitable viscosity measurements and with results of tests in laboratory pumping rigs. Comparative measurements of viscosities were obtained with different viscometers. A critical shear rate of G = 50 s1 was found for the borderline pumping conditions of the test engine. Good correlations were obtained between viscosity data of a rotational viscometer and engine pumping data. With a special laboratory pumping rig, which was developed for this program, very good correlations were obtained with the low temperature pumpability of the engine.

More than 250 participants from 18 countries attended this meeting offering a total of 24 papers presented by speakers from 11 countries. The program of the colloquium provided an almost complete review of the present state of technology in the field of multigrade engine oils and their development. Besides the requirements of engines for specific engine oils and the fundamentals of rheology, the following main subjects were discussed: Viscosity classification of engine oils development in the USA and in Europe; Chemical and physical properties of viscosity index improvers; Cold flow behavior and high temperature viscosity of VI-improver containing oils; Influence of mechanical, thermal, and oxidative stresses; Engine performance of multigrade engine oils; Startability and pumpability of engine oils. Some of the more important results and conclusions related to the subject of the relationship of engine oil viscosity to engine performance are reported and dis- cussed. 780980. (SP-434) Assessment of Lubrication Conditions in a Big-End Bearing by Temperature Meas- urements - Correlation with High Shear Viscos- ity. J. du Parquet and A. Godet, TOTAL, Centre de Recherches (France). When dealing with overall engine performance, engine journal bearings are recognized to be of major impor- tance. Their lubrication can be critical, especially with increasing sump temperatures, as it is already a high energy consuming process. Of all the measurements possible to control engine bearing performance, temperature measurements are the most advantageous and simplify the recording process. Discussion: G. Lane, D. C. Roberts and M. A. Vickers, Esso Research Centre (England). 1978 SA E Transactions 780981. (SP-434) A Simple High Shear Viscometer - Aspects of Correlation with Engine Perform- ance. W. C. Pike, F. R. Banks and S. Kulik, BP Research Centre, The British Petroleum Co., Ltd. (Middlesex/England). A simple rotary viscometer has been constructed in which multi-grade oils can be tested at temperatures up to 150°C and at shear rates of up to 4 X 105 s_1. Correlation has been made using this apparatus between multi-grade oil shear stability and engine bearing and cylinder bore wear. However, additional tests demonstrated that the chemical action of anti-wear additives also has a major influence on cylinder bore wear. Discussion: M. J.

(SP-434) Viscosity Effects on Engine Wear Under High-Temperature, High-Speed Condi- tions. M. L. McMillan, R. C. Rosenberg and C. K. Murphy, General Motors Corp. Four multigrade engine oils, containing the same base oil plus SE additive package but VI improvers of differing shear stability, were evaluated in 80 000 km of high-speed, high-temperature vehicle service. Bearing, piston ring and valve guide wear, as well as oil consumption, oil filter plugging and engine cleanliness were all worse for the engines operated on the low-shear stability oils. The wear differences were traced to differences in high-shear-rate viscosity, while the clean- liness, filter plugging and oil consumption differences occurred because of excessive wear or polymer shear degradation. These results suggest that engine oil viscosity should be specified under high-shear-rate conditions. Discussion: M. F.

Peter J. Ghirla and R. Kennedy Smith, Acheson Industries, Inc. The influences on fuel efficiency of viscosity difference and friction modification by colloid friction modifiers in motor oil were examined separately and in combination in a series of automobile track tests using EPA test procedures. The results of this work demonstrated the following: 1 . In this test program, simply reducing the viscosity of multi-grade engine oils did not produce consistent, statistically significant fuel economy benefits. 2. The incorporation of a colloid friction modifier in reduced viscosity multigrade oils produced consistent and statistically significant improvements in fuel economy over those same reduced viscosity multigrade oils without colloid friction modification. 3. Whereas reduced viscosity multigrade oils did not show significant benefits over a commercial type SAE 10W-40 proposal S-l oil, those same reduced viscosity multigrade oils containing colloid friction modifier dem- onstrated consistent and statistically significant improve- ments in fuel economy over that commercial oil. 4. Incorporation of colloid friction modifier in a single grade (SAE 30) oil produced consistent and statistically significant improvements in fuel economy over the commercial type SAE 10W-40 oil. Statistically valid improvements in fuel efficiency due to the presence of colloid friction modifier can be observed in this data in the general range of five to ten 134</page><page sequence="118">780985 - 780995 percent. 780985. (SP-434) A Study of Lubricating Oil Perform- ance in a Journal Bearing Rig. N. van Os, A. Bos, D. van Namen and J. C. E. D. de Rooij, Koninklijke/Shell-Laboratorium (Amsterdam/ The Netherlands). Several polymer-containing oils have been studied in a journal bearing rig under hydrodynamic lubrication conditions. For shear rates up to 2.5 X 105 s_1 and oil film thicknesses down to 2 jam, these oils showed the same behaviour as polymer free oils. In a second series of experiments, the bearing was provided with a suitable lining and experiments were carried out under boundary lubrication conditions. Bear- ing wear could be determined by weighing of the bearing shells, and the results obtained show that for Newtonian lubricants wear increases markedly with decreasing viscosity. The influence of the performance package was demonstrated by two SAE 30 grades. A decrease in wear of about 60% was effected by a change of the performance package. For non-Newtonian lubricants the wear level is lower than expected on the basis of high shear viscosity alone; an attempt to explain this behaviour should take into account non-Newtonian effects and possibly the presence of films of adsorbed material. 780986. Discussions and Author Closures from the Sym- posium Entitled, "The Relationship Between Engine Oil Viscosity and Engine Performance -Part IIP (SP-429). Ross M. Stewart, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co.; and Ted. W. Selby, Savant, Inc. This paper was made up from the prepared discussions and author closures of the Symposium Papers. The Symposium was held at Cobo Hall, Detroit, Michigan on March 1, 1978 as part of the SAE Congress and Exposition. The nine papers presented at the Symposium were bound in a booklet. These discussions and author closures provide a supplement to the bound papers, SAE SP-429 and ASTM STP 621-52. 780990. Recent General Electric Engine Development Testing for Improved Service Life. R. C. Turn- bull, General Electric Company. More exact simulation of engine in-service operating conditions by accelerated development test program improvements - T700/F 1 0 1 /F404/CFM56/CF6 - are re- viewed for lessons learned towards earlier identifica- tion/solution of engine life extension problems. Improved design features, improved analysis and test simulation of mission cycles, improved component test techniques and, in general, increased emphasis on demonstrating required minimum service life prior to Production are briefly discussed. Possible future direction of these efforts is indicated for consideration in General Engine Specifi- cation revisions. 780991. The Application of a Design Verification System and Accelerated Mission Testing to Gas Turbine Engine Development. Bernard J. McDonnell, Government Products Division, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, West Palm Beach, FL. Two advanced techniques to improve the process of designing and developing high technology gas turbine engines are being evaluated and implemented at the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Government Products Division: • Improved Design Verification System. • Accelerated Mission Endurance Test Techniques. These techniques are not new, but they have been significantly improved and strengthened in the past few years by the development of new high technology instrumentation and sophisticated computerized design prediction methods. These tools are aimed at providing improved product reliability during the early operational phase and reducing ultimate cost of ownership for the user. 780992. Planning the Development and Qualification Process for the Next Generation of High Tech- nology Aircraft Engines. S. M. Hudson and W. L. Mclntire, Detroit Diesel Allison. The concurrent requirements to maximize performance and minimize cost and program risk provide a great challenge for the weapon-system planner and the propul- sion-system manager. The propulsion-system development process consists of the definition of requirements, the selection of the appropriate technology, the design and fabrication of the configuration, the verification of characteristics, and the resolution of problems identified during the verification phase. The development process must be structured to be consistent with the current procurement policies and be responsive to requirements of timing and funding constraints. This paper addresses the development process for the high-technology aircraft engine in the light of recent military engine experience and the current policies and constraints. 780994. Requirements and Constraints in the Develop- ment and Qualification of Gas Turbine Engines for the Navy. Martin E. Dell, Naval Air Propul- sion Center; and Michael D. Mead, Naval Air Systems Command. An improved approach to the development and quali- fication of aircraft turbine engines has been developed by the Navy. The approach places emphasis on durability testing throughout the engine development program. This testing is intended to assure that structural requirements have been achieved upon the introduction of new engines into service. The approach utilizes three different types of durability tests each of which is intended to address a separate aspect of the overall durability problem. 780995. Prop-Fan Propulsion - Its Status and Potential. James F. Dugan, Jr., NASA Lewis Research Center; Bernard S. Gatzen and William M. 135</page><page sequence="119">780997-781001 Adamson, United Technologies. Studies have established that advanced turboprop (prop- fan) equipped aircraft will reduce fuel consumption by 15 to 30 percent compared to aircraft equipped with high-bypass turbofan engines of equivalent technology. A reduction in direct operating costs of approximately 10 percent has been identified for commercial aircraft as well as approximately a 20 percent lower gross weight airplane for long endurance military missions. The prop-fan propulsion system is being investigated as part of the NASA Aircraft Energy Efficiency program which in- cludes both analytical studies and experimental tests. The experimental work encompasses performance and acous- tic wind tunnel tests on several prop-fan models. The prop-fan technology status is reviewed in the major areas of performance, installed effects, cabin noise, blade structure and maintenance cost. Also, future activities required to complete the technical validation of prop-fans are described. 1978 SA E Transactions 780997. Propeller Slipstream/Wing Interactions at Mach No. 0.8. Daniel P. Bencze and Ronald C. Smith, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, CA; H. Robert Welge and James P. Crowder, Douglas Aircraft Co., Long Beach, CA. An initial wind-tunnel test was conducted to investigate the aerodynamic interactions between a propeller slip- stream and a supercritical wing at transonic Mach numbers. The primary independent variables examined included Mach number, wing lift coefficient, and slip- stream Mach number and swirl. The interference effects were found to be weak functions of free-stream Mach number, wing lift coefficient, and slipstream Mach number; swirl was found to have a significant effect. At a free-stream Mach number of 0.8 and a lift coefficient of 0.5, incremental drag results for 7° of swirl (upwash inboard) and a slipstream Mach number of 0.87 indicate a penalty equivalent to a 0.024 loss in propeller efficiency. However, at 11° the drag increment was favorable and was equivalent to a 0.032 increase in propeller efficiency. Wing pressure data indicated the effects of the slipstream were essentially restricted to that section washed by the slipstream. The addition of power to the slipstream tended to move the wing shock aft slightly. Swirl had significant effects on the chordwise pressure distributions of the inboard section of the wing within the slipstream but only slight effect on the outboard section. Neither surface nor wake pressures showed signs of significant flow separation induced by the slipstream. Although the results of this initial test have identified some questions that must be resolved, the test has proved very valuable in defining the magnitude of the interaction. The penalties associated with the slipstream were found to be considerably less than anticipated, thus enhancing the overall potential of turboprops for high-speed cruise applications. 780999. TDS - A Preliminary Design System for Tur- bines. Richard R. Wysong, General Electric Co. The Turbine Design System (TDS) is a time sharing computer system developed for preliminary design and performance evaluation of axial flow turbines having up to ten stages. TDS is an interactive, modularized system incorporating aerodynamic, heat transfer and structural analyses in a contiguous arrangement. Each task-oriented module addresses one major facet of the design process. This paper discusses the overall system philosophy and organization, the input/output data flow, the tasks performed, and the functional utilization of the system. Selected results of a sample case are shown. Discussion: Ronald W. Lindlauf, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. 1978 SA E Transactions 781000. Integrally Cast Turbine Rotor for High Volume Production. Larry A. Junod and John R. Arvin, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The goal is to design an integrally cast wheel with blades which can be produced from high volume production tooling. An automated procedure is described to deter- mine the optimum radial orientation, or "stacking," of turbine rotor blade sections to give a design which satisfies both high production manufacturing and rotor structural requirements. High production manufacturing requires that the spaces between blades be pulled away from the wheel in a generally radial direction to release the wax replica of the wheel from the tooling. Structural require- ments are expressed in terms of bending stress constraints. A pullability index is defined to indicate the amount of interference to be encountered in removing the tooling. This index is optimized with respect to the direction of removal of the tooling. Bending stress requirements are simultaneously satisfied. 781001. An Alternating Direction Explicit Method for Computing Three-Dimensional Viscous Flow Fields in Turbomachines. Leonard Walitt, Nu- merical Continuum Mechanics, Inc., Woodland Hills, CA; C. Y. Liu, Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA; and James L. Harp, Jr., Thermo- Mechanical Systems Co., Canoga Park, CA. A numerical method has been developed to solve the steady three dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes equations by successive approximations. The method is applicable to rotors of axial or radial com- pressors and turbines. Viscous flow fields were calculated in the blading passages of an axial supersonic compressor cascade, a radial impeller and a backswept impeller. Pressure measurements on the cascade blades agreed with corresponding computations. Radial impeller calculations showed suction blade separation, while backswept cal- culations indicated shroud separation. This paper de- scribes the numerical method in detail, with results presented as numerical examples. Discussion: Lit S.

An In-Place Recalibration Technique to Extend the Temperature Capability of Capacitance-Sens- ing, Rotor-Blade-Tip-Clearance Measurement Systems. John Barranger, NASA Lewis Re- search Center, Cleveland, OH. It is known that capacitance-sensing, rotor-blade- tip- clearance measurement systems suffer from a strong dependency on probe tip temperature and humidity. A novel in-place recalibration technique partly overcomes this problem through a simple modification of the electronics that permits a scale factor correction. The technique is used to reduce the errors in a commercial system by more than 50 percent up to a temperature of 370° C (700° F). A probe design is proposed to further raise the maximum temperature capability of the meas- urement system. 781004. Naval Aviation Training - Perspective and Pros- pects. Jack Russ, U.S. Navy. The unique character of Naval Aviation is evident in the aircraft carrier and low level Overwater operations. The Navy's training system embraces this uniqueness as well as the more familiar aspects of flying in preparing both fledgling and experienced pilots to step into the fleet cockpits. The system has evolved over many years from a generalist approach to one of more specialized expertise. The process of primary weapons system design and procurement is now recognizing the necessity for early consideration of training requirements. Recent devel- opments forecast an emerging system designed from the ground up for pilot training. 781005. Cost Analysis of Pilot Training Systems. Herbert F. Harris and Harold E. Boren, Jr., Northrop Corp. This paper discusses the resources that must be considered when determining the costs of pilot training systems. Material presented here is based on the authors' expe- rience in estimating the cost of current and advanced Pilot Training Systems. The paper examines how system requirements, such as number of students, attrition rates, course syllabi, and maintenance concepts impact training system personnel and equipment cost. The discussion also shows the sensitivity of pilot training cost to variations in training system requirements and hardware character- istics. 781006. Recent Studies of Simulation Training Effec- tiveness. Wayne L. Waag, Air Force Human Resources Lab., Flying Training Div., Williams AFB, A Z. Four studies investigating the effectiveness of flight simulation training are presented. They were selected on the basis that they illustrate the training effectiveness methodology currently employed, and that they demon- strate the potential value of simulation training. These four efforts address: (1) the training effectiveness of platform motion; (2) the relative effectiveness of alternate visual systems; (3) the effectiveness of generalized surface attack training; and, (4) the effectiveness of A- 10 simulation training. These studies are discussed in terms of implications regarding required levels of fidelity as well as the potential value of the training. 781007. Recent Developments and Plans for Pilot Train- ing Devices. Don Norman, Naval Training Equipment Center. Evolved from a research tool, the first of a family of very-low-cost part-task training devices is now being developed and will shortly enter an evaluation phase. Key to the low system cost is use of a minicomputer and graphics display in a small, stand-alone cabinet. Training features are concentrated in software, stored in a library of diskettes. Low cost and portability of systems should lead to wider availability of refresher training and consequent increases in readiness and safety. 781008. Army Aviation Training - Research Now and Then. James A. Bynum, US Army Research Institute Field Unit, Fort Rucker, AL. The US Army's Aviation Training Research and Devel- opment Program is discussed in this paper. An overview of the research program concept is presented, with special emphasis on the behavioral research required to enhance aircrew performance. The overview is followed by dis- cussions of representative research in the areas of tactical flight training, flight simulation, and aviator selection and assignment. The discussions emphasize the user orien- tation of the research and development and project the advanced techniques and trends in training and equip- ment. 781009. Universal Airborne Approach to Pilot Perform- ance Assessment. John C. Cotton, Canyon Research Group, Inc., Westlake Village, CA. Aircrew Performance Measurement is emerging from a research venture into the realms of developing technology. Initially the technology is being developed for the quantitative assessment of undergraduate pilots flying skills as they transition from training airplanes to the more sophisticated operational types. The universal approach to the system development will enable similar equipment and mechanizations to be used on all airplane types and furthermore to the quantitative measurement of aircrews for certification renewal purposes. 781010. Environmental Factors Affecting the Installation and Operation of Gas Turbine Engines In Agri- cultural Aircraft. Gordon M. Hogg, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft of Canada Ltd. The operational and economic environments associated with agricultural aircraft have dictated several changes to basic turbine engine installation procedures.

Aircraft missions are analyzed, and the effect of high cycle time on 137</page><page sequence="121">781013 -781024 major rotating components explained. In addition, with jet fuel seldom available at remote fields, alternates such as diesel and gasoline - together with their limitations - are dealt with.

Methanol, Ethanol and Jet Fuel Emissions Com- parison from a Small Gas Turbine. J. Barrett Pullman, Univ. of Santa Clara. A 60 H.P. gas turbine engine has been easily converted to operate on methanol and ethanol fuels. No unusual fuel system hardware problems were experienced during 15 hours of testing with methanol and one hour of testing with ethanol. Our computer model's predicted low emissions of NOx and CO for methanol were closely approximated after the installation of an air atomizing fuel nozzle. Substantial NOx reductions also resulted from ethanol fuel. Hydrocarbon unburned fuel emissions were in- creased with methanol and ethanol. Agreement is found with five previously reported methanol gas turbine experiments which indicate from 60% to 80% NOx reductions in comparison with distillate- type fuels. Combustor inlet temperature variation is considered as one cause of variability of reported CO emissions with methanol. Droplet size effects and in- creased ignition delay are considered to adversely affect methanol's CO and hydrocarbon emissions. Detailed emissions data for NOx, NO, N02 CO and hydrocarbons are reported for several series of fuel nozzle tests with methanol, ethanol and Jet A fuels. 781015. Preserving Man's Role in Battlefield Air Support Operations. John W. Ellis, Jr., The Rand Corp., Santa Monica, CA. This paper argues, first, that there is still need for battlefield air support in modern combined arms conflict, and, secondly, that the vital contribution of man's unique intellectual capabilities to that function can be retained while avoiding much of his exposure to battlefield air defense required by current operational procedures. It is proposed to accomplish this goal by melding a remotely- manned, real-time surveillance, acquisition, designation, and fire direction capability with a conventional, manned strike aircraft into a cooperative, complementary system. The remainder of the paper describes the functional components of a possible system, suggests one way these might be integrated into a joint Army-Air Force opera- tional concept, and speculates on some of the benefits to be obtained. 781016. A New Approach to Tactical Weapons Delivery - A Closed Loop RECCE/Strike System Using Mini Drones. Zot Barazzotto, Aeronautical Systems Div./SD26R, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. The Harassment Weapon System (HWS) program has demonstrated the practical utility of a mini drone based weapons system. Completed studies and analysis provide a solid basis for HWS entering engineering development with a lethal system which is effective against all components of the Warsaw Pact air defense network. This paper provides a conceptual framework for integration of a mini drone based weapons system as a part of the total force structure. 781017. Strike Drone - A Defense Suppression Concept Using Unmanned Cruise/Loiter/ Attack Vehicle. F. Dale Groutage, Naval Ocean Systems Center. A concept for an advanced defense suppression system using an unmanned (bomb rack launched, 500 lb class air launched) vehicle with cruise/loiter/attack capabilities has been developed. Guidance commands are provided by either a radiation sensor or a flight reference unit depending upon the phase of the trajectory (anti-radiation during attack/flight reference during cruise and loiter). Two airframe configurations (mono wing and cruciform) were analyzed for the three phases of the flight trajectory. Overall systems requirements such as speed, weight, thrust levels, maneuverability, cross section and control con- figurations were formulated. 1978 SA E Transactions 781019. Recognition of Damage - Tolerance in Civil Airworthiness Standards. James E. Dougherty, Dept. of Transportation, Federal Aviation Admin. Amendments relating to the structural fatigue evaluation requirements are described. The amendments improve and update the air-worthiness standards applicable to the type certification of civil transport category airplanes. They take into account state-of-the-art developments and accumulated service experience. The authority for and origin of the related rules is also briefly traced. The interest in world-wide acceptance of these new standards is noted. 781021. Damage-Tolerance Practices Applied to Trans- port Aircraft Structures. M. Stone, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., Long Beach, CA. Modern jet transport aircraft structures, although certified in accordance with current regulations, have been de- signed using damage-tolerance practices which resulted in an excellent safety record. In spite of these practices unpredictable cracks and corrosion occur in service. The new regulations recognize these developments and place special emphasis on certification of damage-tolerant structures. Present damage-tolerance methods and procedures are discussed. Analytical methods are described which ac- count for the upgrading of the new regulations. 781024. Technology and the New Look Meet the F/A-18 138</page><page sequence="122">781025 -781029 Radar Reliability Challenge. Freeman B. Nelson and Charles F. Farrell, Hughes Aircraft Co., Culver City, CA. The F/A- 18 Program is among the first to apply the Naval Air Systems Command "New Look Acquisition Fun- damentals" from contract award. The New Look estab- lishes firm requirements and incentives for achieving reliability and maintainability. It imposes stringent dis- ciplines on design, test, and manufacturing to assure compliance to those requirements. In the case of the radar (at least), the level of reliability and maintainability specified could not be achieved by these disciplines alone. A substantial simplification of system architecture and its hardware (over previous tactical radars) was also required. This paper describes how that simplification was achieved, while at the same time gaining substantially in multi- mission capability. It also summarizes the status of key elements of the New Look program at this early stage of the development program. 781025. Procuring Equipment Items That Meet R, M and SS Requirements. R. K. Hood, Boeing Aero- space Co. The successful procurement of hardware items with reliability R, maintainability M, and system safety SS requirements and R, M, and SS program requirements involves no particularly new or unusual techniques. It does require the consistent, disciplined use of several of the tools presently available, i.e., the item specification, a really comprehensive statement of work (SOW) and a data requirements list (CDRL). These all must be closely coordinated so that they "track together". Clear distinc- tions between tasks to be accomplished, requirements for the design, and data items to be prepared are essential. Also, most system contractors need to better inform their potential suppliers. 1978 SA E Transactions 781026. Effects of Fuel Properties on Soot Formation in Turbine Combustion. D. W. Naegeli and C. A. Moses, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Re- search Lab., Southwest Research Inst., San Antonio, TX. A T-63 combustor rig has been used to study the sensitivity of combustor performance to the physical and chemical properties of fuels. The purpose was to deter- mine the impact of broadening fuel specifications and using non-specification fuels in emergencies. The fuel properties of special concern were the composition, the distillation curve and viscosity. The first property is associated with the chemistry of carbon formation while the latter two are related to mixing as they affect the atomization and vaporization. Six fuels were blended from a JP-5 base fuel and used to determine the effects of aromatic content, types of aromatics, and end point. Three JP-5s derived from coal, shale oil, and tar sands, were used to see if they correlated the same as the petroleum-derived fuels despite their different chemistry. Seven more fuels that were blends of marine diesel, JP5, and gasoline were used to examine all aspects but with emphasis on viscosity and distillation curve. Four emul- sified fuels containing 5, 10, 20 and 30% water were prepared with one of the above high aromatic JP-5 fuel blends. Two more emulsified fuels containing 10 and 20% water were prepared with the shale oil derived JP-5. The combustor was instrumented for flame radiation, exhaust smoke, and gaseous emissions. Measurements of these items were made at the full power condition. The hydrogen/carbon ratio was the most effective correlating parameter for radiation and smoke; sensitivi- ties to molecular structure appeared to be secondary. Similar to the syncrude fuels, the water/fuel emissions and methanol/aromatic blends correlated in the same way as petroleum fuels. Higher end points did not affect the correlation indicating that soot formation was due to gas phase reactions not liquid phase pyrolysis. The results favor a chemical mechanism for the role of water in reducing soot. 781027. Shale Oil - The Answer to the Jet Fuel Avail- ability Question. Leonard C. Angello, Arthur V. Churchill, Charles L. Delaney and Herbert R. Lander, Air Force Aero Propulsion Lab., Wright-Patterson AF Base, OH. The Department of Defense consumes approximately 2.7 percent of the total U.S. demand for petroleum. The Air Force usage accounts for 57 percent of the DOD consumption with approximately 82 percent being con- sumed as jet fuel. The cost of this fuel to the Air Force has increased greatly since the 1973 oil embargo. The bill in 1973 was slightly over one-half billion dollars for 112 million barrels of JP-4, whereas, it is now approximately 1.6 billion dollars or about 6 percent of the Air Force annual budget for only 80 million barrels. This paper discusses an Air Force program which will result in adequate fuel availability for the Air Force at an acceptable cost. Results of recent processing studies on alternative hydrocarbon sources from shale oil are presented, together with combustor studies directed to determining the effects of property variations on combus- tor performance, durability and level of harmful emis- sions. A projection of the chemical and physical properties of the future Air Force aviation turbine fuel is presented. 781029. Life Cycle Cost in Advanced Technology Engine Development. F. W. Tegarden and W. W. Shoemaker, Advanced Engineering and Tech- nology Programs Dept., General Electric Co., Cincinnati, OH. The rising cost of Military Aircraft Systems during a period of declining purchasing power has forced the military and industry to make trade-offs of system and component performance against cost, even during the advanced technology stages of development. An evalu- ation tool is needed for use by the conceptual design- er/evaluator to characterize these tradeoffs properly. 139</page><page sequence="123">781030-781037 A computerized Life Cycle Cost Model has been developed that uses parametric data to help the designer to determine these trade-offs/cost values during advanced technology engine development stages. This computerized model includes airframe and mission considerations. 781030. Applying Design-To-Life Cycle Cost Methods During Engine Advanced Development. J. R. Apel and D. E. Wiltse, Teledyne CAE, Toledo, Ohio. In order to make better decisions during advanced development of turbine engines, life cycle cost (LCC) methodologies must adequately reflect the impact of engine design decisions on the total system LCC. Two applications of Teledyne CAE's APSICOST Methodology are presented herein. These demonstrate the integrated nature of turbine engine LCC analyses with total aircraft system LCC. It is recommended that a joint airframe/propul- sion/government effort be undertaken to standardize methods for reflecting aircraft system LCC impacts in turbine engine advanced development activities. 781031. Turbine Engine Cost Reduction Using Life Cycle Cost Techniques. C. E. Curry, R. V. Earle and G. H. Pedersen, Detroit Diesel Allison, Div. of General Motors, Indianapolis, IN. This paper describes the technical approach and devel- opment of methodologies used to conduct design trade studies from a Life Cycle Cost standpoint. A discussion of computer program capability is followed by a general discussion of several engine design trade studies. The potential for influencing engine design using a Life Cycle Cost methodology is emphasized. 781032. Life Cycle Cost in Preliminary Engine Design. John Vernon, United Technologies Corp., Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, Government Prod- ucts Div., West Palm Beach, FL. To ensure cost effective programs, future military aircraft designs must more fully consider the sensitivity of weapon system life cycle cost to engine design life and duty cycle requirements. In many instances, the life of expensive engine parts can be extended with only a small change in cost or weight. This paper discusses the life cycle cost effects of the F100-PW-100 engine design life and duty cycle on the F-15 weapon system life cycle cost. The importance of establishing actual engine usage and duty cycle definitions early in the program and continual updating of these dynamic variables to minimize their impact on weapon system cost of ownership is shown. 781033. Trade-Off Studies with an Interactive En- gine/Airframe Life-Cycle-Cost Model. D. H. Comey, D. G. Culy and J. E. Cassidy, Airesearch Manufacturing Company/Rockwell International. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of interactive connections between the engine and airframe sections of an aircraft life-cycle-cost model in performing trade-off studies. A model is defined that can accept engine descriptions at the part level, and aircraft mission descriptions for each segment. An important feature of the model is airframe and engine resizing as a result of changes in mission and engine design parameters. Three different trade-off studies are shown to illustrate the versatility of this type of model. The effects of not resizing the airplane and engine are also shown. 781034. Seismic Qualification of Equipment in Essential Facilities. Gary L. McGavin, Wyle Labs. Essential facilities are those buildings whose functions are required for the welfare of the public after an earthquake. They include hospitals, communication centers, police and fire stations. A considerable amount of attention has been paid to these facilities to assure that they are structurally competent. Very little significance has been placed on the nonstructural equipment necessary for them to continue operation after an earthquake. This paper describes the operational system and seismic category approach that can be used by the design team to assess the relative worth with respect to overall facility operation of the nonstructural equipment. The various methods of seismic qualification such as shake table testing, complex analysis, simple analysis and engineering judgment are also discussed for nonstructural equipment. 781035.

Utility systems in regions where seismic activity occurs frequently (especially in California) face the added task of monitoring the motion of their facilities due to ground shaking. This paper discusses the seismic instrumentation system of one Southern California electric utility. The company's instrumentation falls into three categories: 1. Company initiated, supported and operated, 2. California State agency initiated, supported and operated, and 3. Federal agency initiated, company supported and operated. The paper discusses the purpose of each of these three categories and the resulting differences. 781037. Seismic Qualification of Diesel Generator Sys- tem. Roland T. M. Yang, Engine and Com- pressor Div., Délavai Turbine, Inc., Oakland, CA. Due to the critical nature of the application, diesel generator standby systems for nuclear power stations are required by law to be able to survive seismic disturbances and remain functional. Due to the large physical size and weight of this equipment, special considerations would have to be given, to arrive at a balance between reliability and cost. This paper describes the method used, the required engineering judgment and quality level of the 140</page><page sequence="124">781038-781044 results. Prior to the application of diesel generators as emergency standby power source for nuclear power plants, the effects of seismic disturbance were not seriously considered, although the diesel generators have proven over the years to be very reliable as well as durable in conventional applications. The application of diesel generators for nuclear standby power was relatively new and there was insufficient data available to develop any correlation between calculated and actual system re- sponse, or any form of design guide, for that matter. Due to the critical nature of the application, it is essential to insure that the diesel generator and its auxiliaries will survive seismic disturbances and remain functional whenever emergency power is called for. This created the need for seismic qualification which requires accurate analysis or test to attain the required level of reliability. 781038. V/STOL Aircraft Engine and Mechanical Drive Component Integration. S. M. Hudson and P. E. Beam, Jr., Detroit Diesel Allison Division, General Motors Corporation. V/STOL aircraft propulsion systems are required to provide vertical lift, horizontal thrust, attitude control, and distribution of power for engine-out cases with high efficiency, low weight, and high reliability. These V/STOL requirements have been converted into specific design objectives for mechanical drive components including the gears, bearings, clutches, and shafting that interconnect the engines, lift and propulsion fans, and rotors in various V/STOL aircraft defined in recent system studies. 781039. Advanced Overrunning Clutch Technology. Jules G. Kish, Sikorsky Aircraft, Stratford, CT. This paper summarizes the results of a 3 year research program to advance the state-of-the-art in helicopter free-wheel units (overrunning clutches) by permitting operation at 20,000 rpm. By designing the free-wheel unit to operate at engine input speed instead of at the speed of the 2nd reduction where it is usually located, the torque, and hence size and weight of the unit, will be reduced. High-speed designs, test results, and application of the designs to the UH-60A BLACK HAWK are presented for spring, sprag, and ramp roller types of overrunning clutches. 1978 SA E Transactions 781040. Advanced Technology Applied to the CH-47D Drive System. Sol Binder and John C. Mack, Boeing Vertol Company, Philadelphia, Penn- sylvania. The U.S. Army CH-47D helicopter modernization pro- gram incorporates improvements in all major subsystems. The drive train has been redesigned to incorporate evolutionary improvements which will increase reliability, survivability, and maintainability. This paper describes the background experience that led to the selection of VASCO X-2 high-hot-hardness gear steel; it also discusses design improvements in the integration of components, in lubrication and diagnostic systems, in overrunning clutches, and in noise reduction. New capabilities to predict and measure gear bending stresses and resonant frequencies have been developed and are described as part of a systems design approach. 781041. The Lynx Transmission and Conformai Gearing. B. A. Shotter, Westland Helicopters, Ltd. A description of the Lynx transmission is linked with the basic factors which determined its general form. This gear system is compared with other alternatives and an improved Lynx system is also shown which gives even higher load capacity. Some of the characteristics of the output stage Conformai gears are given, together with a description of a few of the development stages through which the gears have passed. 781043. Modal - Testing Options for Spacecraft Devel- opments. Richard C. Stroud, Charles J. Bonner and Gordon J. Chambers, Space Systems Div., Locheed Missiles and Space Co., Sunnyvale, CA. This paper describes the current options for performing modal tests of spacecraft structures. Excitation options include sine dwell, sine sweep, fast sine sweep (chirp), random, initial velocity (impulse), initial displacement (twang), and ambient. Mode detection and modal tuning are discussed. Several methods of modal characterization are examined. These include tuned dwell, tuned sweep, curvefitting to frequency-response data, and time-domain analysis. Comparision of the various options are made on the basis of practical and theoretical observations as well as results of comparative tests performed on a simple structure. 1978 SA E Transactions 781044. Comparison of Modal Test Methods on the Voyager Payload. B. R. Hanks and R. Miseren- tino, NASA, Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA; S. R. Ibrahim, Old Dominion Univ., Norfolk, VA; S. H. Lee and B. K. Wada, NASA, Jet Propulsion Lab, Pasadena, CA. A comparison of the performance of modern modal data analysis methods on test data from the Voyager Jupiter/ Saturn payload is presented. Four different test/data- analysis combinations are compared - multiple-point sine excitation tests, single-point random-excitation tests using two different techniques of manipulating Fourier trans- form data, and a time-domain method for analyzing random data. Results indicate that all four methods can give comparable results. Of the four, the time-domain approach detects more modes in the test data and, at the same time, shows the greatest promise for reducing the time and cost of modal testing. 1978 SA E Transactions 141</page><page sequence="125">781045 -781055 781045. Space Shuttle Main Propulsion Test System Resonance Survey by Single Point Excitation Method. Garth Wiley, William Ashton and John VanBenschoten, Structural Dynamics Re- search Corporation; and James Schendel, Rock- well International Space Division. The single point excitation procedure employed to experimentally determine the natural modes of the Space Shuttle Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA) installed in the static firing test stand at the National Space Tech- nology Laboratory is described. Test techniques, equip- ment, and associated software are described and a comparison to math model results is included. Three single point hydraulic exciters were individually used to apply random excitation forces to the MPTA thrust structure supporting the main engines. Resulting accelerations and force signals were processed with mini-computer test equipment to determine resonant frequencies, mode shapes, and damping values below 50 Hz. Two configurations, one involving empty H2 and LOX tanks and the other involving 40% full LOX tank and feed lines, were tested. Results were obtained with minimum Main Propulsion Test schedule impact and at minimum cost. 781046. Modal Acceptability and Purity Ratio. L. E. Selmer, Rockwell International, Inc. Modal testing has become very popular today for dynamic structural definition and problem resolution of a multitude of dynamic problems. A criterion of purity is presented which is applicable to all modal data regardless of the method of excitation. The modal acceptability and purity ratio allows a one-number linear ratio that describes a percentage deviation from zero, where zero is defined as a pure, natural mode. This ratio was used on the Space Shuttle modal program to provide instant visibility of modal data quality as well as a real-time guide to potential problems associated with certain modes. 781047. Dynamic Model Verification of Large Structural Systems. Larry T. Lee and T. K. Hasselman, J. H. Wiggins Company. Finite element models of large structural systems, such as the Space Shuttle or its major components, may contain thousands of finite elements with tens of thousands degrees of freedom. Dynamic analysis to predict structural frequencies and mode shapes is performed after trans- forming the mass and stiffness matrices, through a series of static reductions, to a reduced set of coordinates which still may include several hundred degrees of freedom. The objective of the present methodology is two-fold: (1) to process test data obtained from either modal survey tests, or slow sine-sweep tests, to extract a set of orthogonal modes best matching the test data while being commen- surate with the dynamic model, and (2) to modify submatrices of the dynamic model mass and stiffness matrices to adjust the model to best fit the test data. The method has been implemented using a linear statistical sequential estimator for computation on a CDC computer. Demonstration problems involving Space Shut- tle Quarter-Scale vibration test data and dynamic models have been run. This paper will discuss the general methodology and experience to date. 781049. Freight Car Vibration Test and Analysis Com- parison: Validation of FRATE. G. Kachadouri- an, MITRE Corp.; and N. T. Tsai, Federal Railroad Administration. A nonlinear computer program for Freight Car Response Analysis and Test Evaluation (FRATE) has been devel- oped under the sponsorship of the Federal Railroad Administration. The computer program incorporates a model of a Trailer on Flat Car (TOFC) configuration. Validation of the FRATE/TOFC program is being accomplished through comparison of analysis results to the results of vibration tests performed on a TOFC configuration at the Rail Dynamics Laboratory in Pueblo, Colorado. Validation criteria include resonant frequency, deflection shape at resonance and amplification of input motions. This paper presents a brief review of the FRATE/ TOFC computer program, a summary of TOFC vibration test results and comparisons of test and analysis results. Procedures followed to achieve acceptable agreement between test and analysis are reviewed. 781050. Use of Radio Controlled Models In the Concep- tual Development of V/STOL Aircraft. Robert W. Kress, Business Development Dept., Grum- man Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY. For a number of years Grumman Aerospace Corporation has made use of radio controlled models on many of its development programs. Benefits of radio controlled model usage are found in technical areas where they are regarded as valid for certain tasks in the airplane design business as well as in economic areas due to the inexpensiveness of the variety of models which are considered herein relative to their performances. 1978 SA E Transactions 781055. An Unstable Subsynchronous Critical Speed Solution. Max Kershisnik, Sundstrand, Rock- ford, Illinois; and Everett Harding, General Dynamics, Fort Worth, Texas. This paper describes the occurrence of and presents a solution to shaft failures caused by an unstable asyn- chronous critical speed, which occurred on a two-part high-speed shaft coupled to a gearbox. The two-part shaft exhibited a first bending synchronous critical speed just below or in the lower portion of the operating speed range of the gearbox. It also exhibited a re-exitation of the same critical speed at a frequency below the rotational speed in the upper portion of the operating speed range. This subsynchronous re-exitation was attributed to the friction generated at the pilot/spline interfaces between the 142</page><page sequence="126">781061 -781066 gearbox input shaft and the shaft coupled to it. Because the gearbox operating speed is well defined and limited, the solution to the problem was to raise the first bending frequency beyond the operating range, by redesigning the shafts to increase stiffness, thus eliminating the critical frequency and its re-exitation as a problem. 1978 SA E Transactions 781061. Fuel Efficient Four-By-Four Vehicles of the Eighties. L. W. Spearman and John Raffa, Spicer Front Drive Systems Div., Dana Corp. This paper will discuss four wheel drive vehicles of today and tomorrow. It offers those in the light truck industry an awareness of fuel economy challenges and an insight into meeting them. Broad in scope, the text touches on many areas of relevance to vehicle fuel economy. It is concerned with the drive systems of four wheel drive vehicles from the light truck industry and written in the qualitative rather than quantitative style. First, a definition of four-by-four vehicles is provided and then the explanation of the drive systems they use. Next, the paper will cover: 1) Changes in the four-by-four market; 2) the effect of federal regulation on four wheel drive vehicle manufac- turers; 3) an overview of E.P.A. fuel economy testing; 4) suggestions for reducing vehicle fuel consumption; and 5) a prototype of a fuel-efficient four wheel drive vehicle. 1978 SA E Transactions 781062. Efficient Light Weight Transfer Cases for Four Wheel Drive Vehicles. Gamble E. Huffaker, New Process Gear Div., Chrysler Corp. Three transfer case models to improve the fuel economy of four wheel drive vehicles have been designed and developed for production. Improved economy is obtained by (1) minimizing churning and friction losses for highway made two wheel drive operation, (2) minimizing the weight of the transfer case assembly, and (3) providing low range transfer case ratios compatible with the lower numerical axle ratios demanded for highway fuel econ- omy. 781063. Light Truck Fuel Economy by Design Efficiency. D. J. Bickerstaff, Ford Motor Company. CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) requirements were authorized for both Cars and Light Trucks as a result of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. This paper addresses the methods by which fuel economy may be increased by design efficiency of Light Trucks in consideration of legislated goals and considers aerody- namic and road load improvements, weight reduction, powertrain selection and optimization. In selecting the optimum fuel efficient design, adequate consideration must be given to emissions, structural durability, per- formance constraints and consumer acceptance and not to forget manufacturing constraints and lead time consid- erations. 1978 SA E Transactions 781064. Analysis of the Directional Response Character- istics of Double Tankers. C. Mallikarjunarao and P. Fancher, Highway Safety Research Inst., Univ. of Michigan. A linear mathematical model is developed for studying the directional response and yaw stability of many-axled, multi-articulated tanker trucks. Analytical results ob- tained from the model provide an understanding of (1) the factors leading to unstable lateral responses of double tankers when only the rear compartment of the rear (pup) trailer is loaded and (2) the likelihood of rollover of the pup trailer in obstacle-avoidance maneuvers on the highway. Rigidizing the connection at the pintle hook is found to improve the directional performance of the double tanker. 1978 SA E Transactions 781065. Analysis of the Rollover Dynamics of Double- Bottom Tankers. T. D. Gillespie and M. K. Verma, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Univ. of Michigan. Due to the high incidence of rollover in the accident experience with Michigan double-bottom tankers, a special study of rollover dynamics was included in the ad hoc study of those vehicles at The University of Michigan. A dynamic model of the vehicle in the roll plane was formulated for study of roll motions under arbitrary lateral force input time histories. The roll response and limit manuever capabilities predicted by the model were compared against that of actual vehicles and good agreement was obtained. The model was used to predict the relative rollover thresholds of the double-bottom tanker and other alternative tanker configurations for comparison to that of other commercial vehicles in a selected double lane-change maneuver. The model con- firmed that double-bottom tankers of the current design exhibit a low rollover threshold in comparison to other commercial vehicles; and that certain design changes proposed as a retrofit would effectively eliminate that disparity. 781066. Testing the Michigan Double-Bottom Tanker. C. B. Winkler, R. L. Nisonger and R. D. Ervin, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Univ. of Michigan. A full-scale vehicle testing program which emphasizes experimental determination of the rollover stability of double-bottom tanker configurations is discussed. The testing program is presented in the context of the total research program which included yaw plane and roll plane analytical studies. The baseline Michigan double-bottom tanker is found to have exceptionally low rollover stability in emergency evasive maneuvers. Vehicle modifications are described which improve stability by a factor of two. Test vehicle loading, anti-rollover outriggers, instru- mentation, and modification hardware are discussed specifically. Results of dynamic handling tests and 143</page><page sequence="127">781067-781888 low-speed maneuverability tests are presented. Conclu- sions regarding the stability of individual vehicle config- urations as well as overall fleet safety are reached. 1978 SA E Transactions 781067. Ride Comfort Aspects of Heavy Truck Design. J. I. Ribarits, J. Aureli and E. Andersers, AB Volvo Truck Div. The design of heavy trucks with respect to the ride comfort poses two classical problems. One is the artic- ulated vehicle problem and the other is the "jumping ride" problem caused by elastic vibrations of the frame. The two problems have been identified in field investigations. The vibration isolating system of a truck has been analysed by means of mathematical simulation. Math- ematical models of different sizes have been used to examine the influence of different parameters. The damping, cab suspension and frame vibration are dis- cussed in detail. Efforts to optimize the system have been made. These results and the results from measurements, such as impedance tests and road tests, have been applied in the development of a COE heavy truck family. The final judgement of the ride comfort of these trucks is also presented. 1978 SA E Transactions 781068. Trend of Japanese Truck, Bus, and Trailer Brakes. K. Aoki, Akebono Brake Industry (Japan).

Trend in Japanese truck, bus, trailers and their brakes were surveyed with few examples of foundation brake and components. 781069. Projecting the Impact of New Medium and Heavy Truck Noise Regulation Strategies on Commu- nity Noise Levels. Paul P. Pataky, Vehicular Noise Control, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper discusses in some detail the mathematical model input data used by the Vehicular Noise Control Department of the General Motors Environmental Activ- ities Staff to project the effects of various medium and heavy truck noise regulation strategies on future com- munity noise levels. The model projects that, for two typical traffic situations, the reduction of new truck sound levels below current requirements does not result in a corresponding decrease in community noise levels. Furthermore, the potential benefits anticipated from the implementation of new truck noise regulations will not be realized without the effective enforcement of operator in-use standards and the control of truck tire noise. 1978 SA E Transactions 781070. (SP-435) Automotive Safety - The Need to Know. Roy C. Haeusler Optional safety features were made standard on American cars twelve years ago when the first highway and traffic safety bills were signed into law. All new cars, large and small and all price classes, were required to comply. However, the consumer must be made aware of present safety standards. There is government influence to purchase small cars in order to conserve fuel; yet statistics show a three to one ratio of death or serious injury to occupants of small cars over those of large cars. The consumer's choice of vehicle and equipment greatly affects his safety and the safety of his passengers. 781885. (SP-432) The Engineer as a Partner in Patent Law. Roy L. Van Winkle, Dresser Industries, Inc. Patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks are exemplified in an easily understood language. Each form of protection is applicable to certain types of intellectual property, although there may be overlaps. Since most types of property fall logically into one area or the other, the decision as to which tyre of protection to pursue is normally not difficult. 1978 SA E Transactions 781886. (SP-432) The Engineer as a Partner in Market- ing. Thomas S. McDaniel, General Motors Corp. Customer satisfaction is the tie which binds engineering and marketing together in any business. It is the driving force of the whole economic system. And the second common bond - the relentless pursuit of facts. 781887. (SP-432) Developing a Partnership Between Engineering and Service. Bruce M. Graning, Outboard Marine Corp. This paper will describe how to organize for effective communications between the Service group and Engi- neering and how to keep these lines of communications open. It will include the assistance required by the Service Department from Engineering, as well as the assistance required by Engineering from the Service organization, in order for each to function most effectively. How to put warranty information into a meaningful form is analyzed in some depth. 781888. (SP-432) The Engineer as a Partner in Finance. Julian A. Piekarski, Pace Associates Inc., Mil- waukee, WI. A primary objective of any company is to generate an adequate return to its owners as measured by the income statement, balance sheet, and other financial tools. In 144</page><page sequence="128">coming up with a satisfactory "bottom line" the man- agement of the company is constantly faced with a wide array of investment alternatives, as well as the need to make funds available to finance these investments. The engineer plays a key role in the decision process both by providing the technology that can be exploited, as well as the technical capability to implement the projects that are selected. It is therefore important that he have an adequate knowledge of financial analysis in order to assist in the process of screening projects for their economic acceptability. This paper is aimed at providing the engineer with the proper attitude and perspective so that he can expand his skills to include the selection and justification of project proposals in the engineering area. 145</page></plain_text>
