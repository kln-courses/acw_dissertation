"The Confusion be- tween Science and Technology in the Standard Philosophies of Science," Technology and Culture 7, no. 3 (Sum- mer 1966): 348-66. A critique of in- ductivist and instrumental philoso- phies of science which equate applied science and technology. "Contrary to most, if not all, writers in the field, I hold that confirmation plays no sig- nificant role in science, pure or ap- plied. The contrary impression seems to me to stem from the fact that both invention and the implementation of novelties-from applied science or from invention-require confirma- tion. The standards of confirmation are legal, and they are set by patent offices in the case of invention and by institutions in charge of public safety and of commercial practices in the case of implementation."

"Both Heidegger and Marx-to some extent as the heirs of He- gel-are philosophers of the future. Axelos' book is written from the Hei- deggerian standpoint, centering on Heidegger's interpretation of the present age in terms of Technik, which is itself a movement in the mission (Geschick) of Being. The movements of the Geschick... are a world-play. The task of a thinking concerned with the future is to play along with the play. The future in Marxist and Heideggerian terms is a 'planetary' age, beyond all nationalism, ruled by a global or planetary technology. Thinking must decide whether and how such technology will be an in- strument of liberation or of oppres- sion. Axelos's confrontation raises many central and interesting ques- tions: what is the relationship be- tween Heidegger's Gelas enheit and Marx's praxis?

Neuchatel: Editions du Griffon, 1955. Pp. 116. Boirel starts out by dis- tinguishing between science and tech- nique according as one aims at knowl- edge, the other at action. But "at the conclusion of this study, science and technique, grasped in their reciprocal combination, appear much more in- timately linked than their divergent aims would have us suppose. While technique, in order to allow satisfac- tion of the needs of man living in the world, realizes a material effect by in- carnating a bodily operation into mat- ter, . . .science guarantees domina- tion of these transforming operations upon matter by expressing them through a series of rational relations." Thus the argument of the book is that science and technique "are fun- damentally two forms of human praxis" (p. 111). BORGMANN, ALBERT.

"Where availability prevails things are present universally and instantly, without danger, subject to easy ma- nipulation, and in a highly mobile manner. But what seem to be positive traits of presence are in fact in- dications of a decline in the presence of things. Advanced availability is identical with advanced evacuation of reality.... The more availability ad- vances the more reality turns into a homogeneous horizon of possibilities" (p. 62). The only limit to technology, the only thing technology does not seem to be able to make available, is procurement itself, since this still "re- quires concentration of specialists in teams and of productive machinery in plants" (p. 68).</page><page sequence="5">Metaphysical and Epistemological Studies [IV] S145 BORING, E.

"What I propose to do here in order to ascer- tain whether machines think or not, is to examine succinctly the two main aspects of the question, namely (a) the nature of computers, and (b) the na- ture of mathematical thought.... In- sofar as machines are the outcome of intelligent and purposive work, they cannot be put in the same class as natural inanimate objects; machines- are matter intelligently organized by technology, and as such they stand on a level of their own. But, on the other hand, it should be kept in mind that artifacts, however complex, operate only with material objects, never with ideal, abstract objects, a sort of oper- ation which is precisely one of the distinctive characterists of educated human beings. This elementary point is missed by most cyberneticians, and it seems to be the clue for the un- derstanding of the whole question." "Action." Pp. 121-50 in Scientific Research, Vol. 2: The Search for Truth. Berlin-Heidelberg-New York: Sprin- ger-Verlag, 1967. Technological the- ories are of two kinds and are as theory-laden as pure science. Sub- stantive technological theories are ap- plications of preexisting scientific the- ories. Operative technological theo- ries are applications of the scientific method to man-machine complexes in nearly real situations; essentially they are scientific theories of action.

The successful rules of modern technological action are grounded in a set of scientific laws, and this explains their effec- tiveness. This is the decisive dif- ference between the rules of mod- ern technology and the rules of art and craft which are found by trial and error and whose effectiveness is unexplained.

"The paper proceeds, in a non-technical way, to apply the pro- posed model to salvationistic theol- ogies, such as that of Teilhard de Chardin, in which God redeems the natural world through an evolution- ary process. The paper discusses the Hermetic tradition, in which the sci- entist and technologist are seen as outgrowths of the magician-alchemist who assists in the redemption of the cosmos. The inspiration of the scien- tist is viewed as a type of shamanistic ecstasy in which the individual con- tacts the non-deterministic part of the world system.

RAND Report P-3244. Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corp., December 1965. Behind re- search in artificial intelligence is the assumption that intelligent activities differ only in their degree of com- plexity. It has been assumed that the information processing which under- lies intelligent behavior can be formu- lated in a program and simulated on a digital computer. This assumption is wrong because "the attempt to analyse intelligent behavior in digital computer language systematically ex- cludes three fundamental human forms of information processing (fringe consciousness, essence/acci- dent discrimination, and ambi- guity tolerance)." There is a highly critical account of current research on the ability of computers at game play- ing, problem solving, language trans- lation and learning, and pattern rec- ognition. He concludes that "we can then view recent work in artificial in- telligence as a crucial experiment dis- confirming the associationist assump- tion that all thinking can be analysed into discrete, determinate oper- ations-the most important dis- confirmation of this Humean hypoth- esis that has ever been produced" (p. 85).

"Why Computers Must Have Bodies in Order to Be Intelligent," Review of Metaphsic.s 21, no. 2 (Sep- tember 1967): 13-32. ". .. workers in AI [artificial intelligence] are neces- sarily committed to two basic assump- tions: (1) an epistemological assump- tion that all intelligent behavior can be simulated by a device whose only mode of information processing is that of a detached, disembodied, ob- jective observer. (2) The ontological assumption, related to logical atom- ism, that everything essential to in- telligent behavior can in principle be understood in terms of a determinate set of independent elements." The author criticizes these two assump- tions using arguments adapted from the phenomenologists. The general argument is that bodily skills and needs have an essential role in in- telligent behavior.

The empirical arguments for artificial in- telligence gain their plausibility only on the basis of an unjustified met- aphysical axiom about the nature of language and intelligent human be- havior, i.e., "that whatever people do can in principle be formalized and processed by machine."

Current research in artificial intelligence (1957-67) is sur- veyed, and the work of Marvin Min- sky is criticized in detail. Assumptions behind this research-biological, psy- chological, epistemological, and on- tological-are critically related to ar- guments about the nature of per- ception and cognition in the works of Heidegger, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Polanyi, and Wittgenstein.

(3) The principal sig- nificance of model representation for cybernetics lies in the heuristic func- tion of the model ...

Some mental phenomena will no doubt have their analogues in machine software (or programming) whereas others may find counterparts only in hardware developments.

"Cybernetics and Mind-Body Problems," Inquiry 12 (1969): 406-19. To what extent do answers to such questions as "Can machines think?" and "Could robots have feelings?" yield insight into traditional mind- body questions? It is claimed that these three approaches to the first set of questions are mistaken: "(1) ma- chines (and robots) obviously cannot think, feel, create, etc., since they do only what they are programmed to do; (2) on the basis of an analysis of the meaning of the words 'machine' ('robot', 'think', 'feel', etc.) we can see that in principle it would be impossible for machines (or robots) to think, feel, create, etc.; (3) machines (and robots) obviously can (or could) think, feel etc., since they do certain things which, if we were to do them, would require thought, feeling, etc. It is ar- gued that, once it is seen why ap- proach (2) is mistaken, it becomes desirable to decline 'in principle' ap- proaches to the first set of questions and to favor'piecemeal investigations' where attention is centered upon what is actually taking place in ma- chine technology, the development of new programming techniques, etc." .

In the first two-thirds of the book there is a discussion of the general problem and this leads, in the last one-third, to the author's primary argument that "Kant was right in thinking freedom to be an unavoid- able problem set by human reason, though wrong in despairing of the power of reason to solve it. For the very fact that freedom is a problem of reason is itself a reason for believing that we are free. Many men have sensed this, but the argument is ex- tremely difficult to articulate and assess. I have attempted to articulate it... and to reformulate it in formal terms with the aid of a profound the- orem of mathematical logic dis- covered by Godel in 1929. It is a con- troversial argument, and I have tried to meet objections raised against it, for I believe it to be ultimately a deci- sive argument which will refute the one sort of determinism -physical de- terminism-which seriously worries men today" (p. 2).

The argument is that Dewey's instrumental theory of knowledge is a philosophy of tech- nology in the sense of being a tech- nological epistemology. As such, "the instrumental theory unites the tradi- tional American interests in mecha- mism and idealism.... The subject and object are drawn together in the active, causal relation of knowing, and the activity of knowing is seen to be a participant in what is finally known. Ideas are embodied in matter by way of technique, and every ad- vance in technology, in perfected methods of inquiry and production, brings the possibility of realizing se- cure values ever closer. Such is the philosophy in which the long history of American ideas culminates; for the instrumental theory is a technological theory both of knowledge and value." MOTHES, HANS.

"Godel's conclusions bear on the question whether a calculating machine can be constructed that would match the hu- man brain in mathematical in- telligence. Today's calculating ma- chines have a fixed set of directives built into them; these directives corre- spond to the fixed rules of inference of formalized axiomatic proce- dure.... But, as Godel showed in his incompleteness theorem, there are in- numerable problems in elementary number theory that fall outside the scope of a fixed axiomatic method, and that such engines are incapable of answering, however intricate and ingenious their built in mechanisms may be and however rapid their oper- ations....

The success already achieved in synthesizing mechanisms that solve difficult problems in the same manner as humans is beginning to provide a theory of problem- solving that is highly specific and operational. The purpose of this pa- per is to draw out some of the impli- cations of this theory for creative thinking. To do so is to assume that creative thinking is simply a special kind of problem-solving behavior. This seems to us a useful working hypothesis."

Technology is not just "a heap of instruments" but part of a specific attitude toward the world as a whole; as such it must be understood against the background of modern philosophy. A comparison of Aris- totle's and Descartes's attempts to elucidate this fundamental back- ground after which technology is de- scribed in terms of three character- istics: (1) its machines, (2) its progress, and (3) its metaphysical dominance of modern life. This dominance can be overcome only by recognizing the reality of something "that in its es- sence is not at all technical, although it makes technology itself possible and lends it a super-technical mean- ing"-that is, the "natura-humanum proportions and limits and thus points to the place where technology has its beginning and end."

I now hypothesize that though it cannot be diagnosed by papers, technology has a structure that is formally identical with that of science. We shall define technology as that research where the main product is not a paper, but instead a machine, a drug, a product, or a process of some sort. In the same way as before there will be a highly competitive rat race, a similar exponential rate of growth, an archive of past tech- nology, and a research front of the current state of the art....

A machine can think, be intelligent, ar- rive at original and unforeseeable so- lutions to problems, modify its re- sponses in accord with experience, as- similate human language-including the language of sensations and emo- tions-and even be self-reproducing. But so long as it is a machine it will not have feelings, precisely because its components belong to another order of nature than the organic. This is why the phrase 'feeling machine' seems permanently deviant, while 'thinking machine' is not" (p. 50). Dis- cusses F. H. George, H. Putnam, and M. Scriven. PUTNAM, HILARY.

Dreyfus's "Why Comput- ers Must Have Bodies in Order to Be Intelligent," Review of Metaphysics 21, no. 2 (September 1967): 13-32] is with his argument that machines are intrinsically incapable of the sort of information processing exemplified in human pattern recognition.... I do not believe that a successful argu- ment against the possibility of in- telligent behavior in machines can be mounted on the fact that digital com- puters process information in the form of determinate machine states. In point of fact, we simply do not understand the basis of human in- telligent behavior well enough to ar- gue definitively either for or against the possibility of machine intelligence. My own present estimation, however, is that when we finally achieve an ade- quate understanding of human pat- tern recognition and problem solv- ing, we will be able to simulate these functions on an entirely digital ma- chine. Indeed, our being able to do so would itself provide evidence of an adequate understanding of these hu- man capacities." Consciousness: a Philosohhic Study of Minds and Machines.

"The germ of this book was the notion that the evolution of theories is very much like processes of invention and product development as they occur in industry; that the two kinds of development can be seen as embodiments of a single underlying process, which I call the displacement of concepts." There is a discussion of the use of tools as a source of concept displacement to theories of decision, with particular reference to the prag- matic tradition (J. Dewey, C. Peirce, C. Stevenson). Concludes that, "if we see deciding in terms of the use of tools, it too becomes a manipulation of instruments to achieve an antici- pated goal. All problems become a species of technical problem."

The thesis is that certain phenomena are 'artificial' in a very specific sense: They are as they are only because of a system's being molded, by goals or purposes, to the environment in which it lives. If natu- ral phenomena have an air of 'neces- sity' about them in their subservience to natural law, artificial phenomena have an air of 'contingency' in their malleability by environment.... En- gineering, medicine, business, archi- tecture, and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent-not with how things are but with how they might be-in short, with design. The possibility of creat- ing a science or sciences of design is exactly as great as the possibility of creating any science of the artificial. The two possibilities stand or fall to- gether. These essays, then, attempt to explain how a science of the artificial is possible.... I have taken as my main examples-in the second and third lectures respectively-the fields of the psychology of cognition and engineering design." And because the topics of artificiality and complexity are closely interwoven, the essay "The Architecture of Complexity" (origi- nally published in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 106, no. 6 [December 1962]: 462-82), is also included in this volume.

"Artificial Intelligence Research," Computers and Automation, vol. 16 (January 1967). The contem- porary controversy over artificial in- telligence is resolving into two kinds of approaches. One believes that the creation of artificial intelligence is still the ultimate goal, but recognizes that it will be a long, slow process of devel- opment. The other group believes that the ultimate goal is more prac- tical, namely, to perform certain op- erations more accurately or more cheaply than is possible for human operators. For this group, the goal is a division of labor between men and machines. STEGMULLER, WOLFGANG. Wissen- schaftliche Erklarung und Begriindung.

"The development, test- ing, and spread of new machines, techniques, and industrial processes is only one species of innovation." The general process of innovation consists of three linked phases and "these three aspects of the process of in- novation may be conveniently re- ferred to by using names borrowed from zoology: (1) the phase of muta- tion, (2) that of selection, and (3) that of diffusion and eventual dominance." This "evolutionary" analysis applies to the internal processes of development of innovation within either natural sci- ence or basic technology or produc- tive industry.

Technical rules are pre- scriptive or normative formulations of laws "in which these laws them- selves are considered to have a certain necessity and a divine or extrahuman status, an objectivity transcending lo- cal human purposes." Natural neces- sity and determinism, the wider con- cepts of a developed science, are con- tained in germinal form in that pre- scientific way of knowing represented by technical rules.

Cybernetics brings about a revolution in philo- sophical outlook, two salient features of which are: "First, the world in cy- bernetics is no longer an isolated sys- tem which is developing by itself in- dependently of an observer and out- side the reach of an agent. On the contrary, it is something which is con- stantly acted upon by the observ- er-agent and which is reacting on the observer-agent ... Second, knowl- edge in cybernetics is not an unedited all-including collection of facts or its apathetic theorization. Knowledge is an intentionally selected collection of facts and a purposively structured theory about those selected facts." Contains a brief account of how this new cybernetic viewpoint affects the epistemological problems of causality, deductive logic, inductive inference, time, and concept formation. Con- cludes that the cybernetic outlook is a "humanization of our outlook." WEBB, JUDSON. "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind," Phzlosophy of Science 35, no. 2 (June 1968): 156-78. Argues that it is a mistake to apply the theorems of G6del and Church to the philosophy of mind as evidence against mechanism. These theorems are presented as purely mathematical theorems, and various applications are discussed critically, in particular the use of G6del's theorem by J. R. Lucas to distinguish conscious and unconscious beings. Concludes that general attempts to extract philoso- phy from metamathematics involve only dramatizations of the construc- tivity problem in foundations. More specifically, philosophical extrapola- tions from metamathematics involve premature extensions of Church's thesis. Cf. J. R.

"The basic hypothesis of cybernetics is that the chief mechanism of the central nervous system is one of nega- tive feedback.... Secondly, cybernet- ics makes the hypothesis that the negative feedback mechanism ex- plains 'purposive' and 'adaptive' be- havior. Broadly speaking, what the cybernetic model does for our out- look is to make us understand how purposive behavior can be manifested by a machine, for 'purposive' can now be defined in terms of negative feed- back." Studies the development of these concepts in the works of W. R. Ashby, N. Wiener, D. M. MacKay, W. S. McCulloch, W. A. Pitts, and L. von Bertalanffy. For comments in this same journal, cf. B. M.

"The application of Newtonian mechanics to resisting media is applied science; if the me- dium is highly specific, so that we take a special interest in it (such as water we want to fire torpedoes in it), we move into technology. The one is concerned with understanding and extending knowledge, the other with using it.... Applied science, though a step on the way to do something, is itself an extension of understanding. Applied science has sometimes been described as concerning with doing, which seems to me to be wrong in linking it with technology rather than with (pure) science." WRIGHT, M. A.
