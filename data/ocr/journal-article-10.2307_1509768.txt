Blackwell Furman University Greenville, SC 29613 In the summer of 1801 a sharp, even bitter exchange of correspondence passed between the Court and Cathedral Preacher in Berlin, Friedrich Samuel Gottfried Sack, and his ministerial protege Friedrich Schleiermacher. The points of contention were Schleiermacher's circle of Berlin friends, whom Sack considered inappropriate company for the young minister, and Schleier- macher's book of 1799, On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers, containing theological views judged by Sack to be irrec- oncilable with the Christian religion Schleiermacher had been ordained to preach. This candid exchange was Schleiermacher's first official encounter with rising tensions between his theological liberalism and the orthodoxy of his Reformed Church background. Indeed these two letters argue theological issues that plagued Schleiermacher throughout his career and have haunted his theol- ogy to our own day, the most central of these being Schleier- macher's refusal to apply terms of personality to God. Yet these seminal letters have received scant attention in German secondary literature,l and to the English reader they have remained all but inaccessible.2 In this article I sketch the circumstances surrounding 'Even Dilthey's comprehensive biography restricts its treatment of these letters to summary and generalized comment.

I By 1801 Schleiermacher had lived with concern about Sack's judgment of his unorthodox theological views for over a decade. An old friend of Schleiermacher's family on the maternal side, Sack had been the Court and Cathedral Preacher in Berlin since 1777, chaplain first to Prussia's Frederick the Great (d. 1786) and then to Frederick's successors, Friedrich Wilhelm II (1786-97) and Friedrich Wilhelm III (1797ff.). Since 1786 he had been a member of the Directorate of the Reformed Church. As a conse- quence, when Schleiermacher took his first series of ministerial examinations in 1790 Sack appeared on his board of examiners. Schleiermacher had found the prospect of these examinations "nauseating,"3 fearing that he would be required "to preach and give answers concerning theological subtleties that in my heart I mock."4 His anxiety over discrepancies between his theological views and the orthodox views expected of him by Sack and the other two examiners echoes in his examination grades: on all subjects "good," "very good," or "excellent," except in dogmatic theology (Dogmatik), where he earned only "fair" (ziemlich).5 Throughout the decade of the 1790s Sack continued to shepherd Schleiermacher's progress toward a ministerial career. The year 1801 found Sack as Schleiermacher's friend, sponsor, advisor, and church superior.6 Sack was sixty-two, Schleiermacher thirty-two. Schleiermacher had long lived with a second concern about his unorthodox views as well, namely, concern about the judgment of the Prussian Censor. In July of 1788 King Friedrich Wilhelm II's minister of ecclesiastical affairs, Johann Christoph von Willner, 3Friedrich Schleiermacher, Aus Schleiermachers Leben in Briefen (2d ed.; Berlin: Reimer, 1860-63) 4. 42.

BLACKWELL 103 had issued an Edict of Religion, launching a campaign against rationalism in religion by requiring all clergymen, both Lutheran and Reformed, to adhere to their official church orthodoxies or face dismissal.7 Besides permeating the atmosphere surrounding Schleiermacher's examinations, the Wollner movement instituted state censorship of the press,8 at the very time Schleiermacher was preparing his first attempts at publication. He found his literary efforts cramped by this political development. In 1792 his uncle, Samuel Ernst Timotheus Stubenrauch, wrote in reply to a letter from Schleiermacher that has not been preserved: This brings me to the place in your letter where you complain of the restrictions of censorship.... But do you in fact have any cause to complain about present day conditions in relation to your philosophical treatises? I really do not believe so. For in actuality there are only the three points upon which the Censor is now being more strict again: that nothing be written against religion, morals, and the state. In regard to the first point, what appears to be the case may well be so, namely, that religion and orthodox system are unfortunately held to be synonymous. But if I know you, you have never had any desire to become an author in the discipline of theology; you will certainly not write anything against morality; and philosophical discussions of freedom will be passed by the Censor without hesitation.... Therefore I simply cannot admit this excuse for the further delay of your treatises. On the contrary, in the interest of provision for your future I must strongly urge you to fulfill your promise to Chaplain Sack promptly, and I want to remind you to be sure to write him again.9 Although the strictures of the Willner Edict were gradually re- laxed after Friedrich Wilhelm III's accession to the throne in 1797, Schleiermacher's Speeches of 1799 still required the Censor's im- primatur in order to appear in print, and Schleiermacher was nervous about his book's prospect of receiving it. In fact, with the publication of his Speeches Schleiermacher's concerns about Sack's judgment of his orthodoxy and about the Prussian Censor's judgment were compounded. Sack himself was 7Klaus Epstein, The Genesis of German Conservatism (Princeton: Princeton Uni- versity, 1966) 142-43. 81bid., 359. 9Briefe, 3. 46. Schleiermacher's treatises of this early period, Uber das hichste Gut and Uber die Freiheit des Menschen, never came to print; see Wilhelm Dilthey, Leben Schleiermachers (1st ed.; Berlin: Reimer, 1870) the Appendix entitled "Denk- male der inneren Entwicklung Schleiermachers," 6-46.</page><page sequence="4">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW appointed to censor the Speeches. The resulting relationship be- tween Schleiermacher and his superior took on an awkward, if not bizarre, aspect. Availing himself of his era's widespread practice of anonymous publication, Schleiermacher had written the Speeches, as he said, "in the strictest incognito."10 His authorship was known to his most intimate friends, but Sack was not among them. As the earliest sections of the anonymous Speeches arrived on Sack's desk, he was in the habit of discussing his opinion of them with Schleiermacher. Quite early in this procedure Sack had an inkling that Schleiermacher was the author, but for a time Schleiermacher managed to equivocate. With the second of the five Speeches, however, the tension approached a climax. "If only S. would finish censoring the end of the second speech," Schleiermacher wrote to his friend Henriette Herz, and I could know how he has taken it, then I could accommodate myself accordingly. If he lets it pass, then I see no reason to disavow to him any longer, and he seems to be so firmly convinced that he might take a disavowal amiss. But if the end has been a thorn in the flesh for him, then I must continue incognito, come what may. In the meantime I can remain entre deux in writing, but face to face? I confess to you, my shrewdness is getting a little wobbly.11 Schleiermacher's anxieties about Sack's reception of the end of the second speech are not difficult to understand. In that section Schleiermacher boldly reinterprets the traditional Christian doc- trines of miracle, revelation, prophecy, and grace, devoting a few terse sentences to each. Then he reinterprets the doctrines of God and immortality, no less boldly and at greater length. Nor was Schleiermacher's premonition about these reinterpretations inaccu- rate. Their radical innovation did not escape Sack's notice. In his office as Censor he passed the Speeches. But in his role as ecclesiastical overseer, when Schleiermacher's authorship became known to him with certainty,12 Sack felt obliged to call his young colleague to task for the theological views of the Speeches. In the winter of 1800-1801, Sack expressed his concern in a letter to Schleiermacher of such bluntness that for five months he hesitated to have it delivered. Already the two were avoiding one o1Briefe, 4. 51. l BrieJe, 1. 201.

By the spring of 1801 they had not been together for some eighteen months. As a step toward overcoming their estrangement Schleier- macher sent Sack a copy of his newly published collection of Sermons.'3 This initiative broke the ice, and in early summer Sack finally sent his antagonistic letter, moderated only by an introduc- tory note of thanks for the Sermons.14 Besides the theological content of the Speeches, to which we shall turn in a moment, the character of Schleiermacher's Berlin friendships came in for criticism in Sack's letter. In particular, Sack attacked Schleiermacher's two most intimate friendships, those with Henriette Herz and Friedrich Schlegel. We do not know the details of Sack's quarrel with Schleiermacher over his friendship with Herz. When in 1850 Sack's son, Karl Heinrich Sack, made public this correspondence of 1801, he excised two passages in Schleiermacher's letter "relating only to personalities."'5 Almost certainly they had to do with Herz,'6 whose death at eighty-three had come only three years before. So far as I am aware, these passages have never come to light. The background of the quarrel is no mystery, however. Schleiermacher's frequent and close asso- ciations with Herz, a married Jewess of lively intellect and statu- esque beauty, had come to a focus of public attention in an 1801 caricature portraying the two of them: Herz, buxom, grand, and garbed in beads and shawl; Schleiermacher, stooped and scarcely half her height, carrying her parasol, in clerical wig and collar, with a copy of the Speeches in his coat pocket.17 The caricature's caption labels the two of them "Jew-wives." Late in life Henriette Herz recollected this crude caricature with the remark, "I believe that 13Schleiermacher, Predigten.

Already in 1798 Schleiermacher had received at first hand Sack's disapprov- al of his attendance in the salons of Herz and Berlin's other Jewish hostesses: Today I have had a heart-to-heart talk with Sack about my Jewish associa- tions.... He said he is not so pedantic as to be opposed to association with Jews (as I knew, since both his father and his father-in-law associated a great deal with Mendelssohn). But for these bureaux desprit. . ., he said, he has no taste at all, and if it were to become too well known that I live so entirely among these people, an unfavorable impression would inevitably be produced upon many. He himself is concerned, he said, that the tone a person little by litte adopts in these societies will in time give rise in me to indifference and antagonism toward my profession.19 Immediately behind Schleiermacher and Herz in the 1801 caricature stands Friedrich Schlegel, under his arm a copy of his journal Athenaeum, to which Schleiermacher had frequently contri- buted. In 1801 Schlegel was living with the daughter of Moses Mendelssohn, Dorothea Mendelssohn Veit-Jewish, recently di- vorced, and not yet married to Schlegel. Only a year before, Schleiermacher had come to the defense of Schlegel's experimen- tal novel Lucinde, both in a review for a Berlin literary journal20 and in an anonymous booklet Schleiermacher published soon afterward.21 Even as Schlegel was completing his novel in the spring of 1799, Schleiermacher had anticipated what lay ahead for the two of them: Lucinde will cause trouble for us both. That the intimate friend of a preacher should write such a book, and the preacher not break with him!22 Once again Schleiermacher's premonition of trouble was accurate, as the text of Sack's letter makes abundantly clear. 18J.

BLACKWELL The personal outcome of Schleiermacher's troubles over his book and his friendships was what Wilhem Dilthey has called "a kind of exile."23 After four years of persistent urging, Sack finally convinced Schleiermacher to leave Berlin in May of 1802 for the court chaplain's post in the Pomeranian town of Stolp near the Baltic Sea. Both Sack and Schlegel tried to console Schleiermacher in the face of this banishment from Berlin.24 Unfortunately for Schleiermacher, however, a note to him from Schlegel's compan- ion Dorothea was to prove more prophetic. Upon receiving news of Schleiermacher's transfer, she wrote: My first move was to the map. God help us, how far away this Stolp lies! How far removed from Berlin, and from every other respectable city; so god-awful northern [so himmelschreyend ndrdlich], so far from everything beautiful. Poor friend, you have much misery before you to endure!25 II Sack's reactions to the theology of Schleiermacher's Speeches have echoed repeatedly in the history of Schleiermacher interpreta- tion. The most intense of these reactions relates to Schleier- macher's impersonal representation of God.26 Sack's concern reaches a climax in this poignant passage from his letter: I despise, disparage and condemn without reservation the (so-called) philosophy-execrable, in my view-that acknowledges at the summit of the universe no self-conscious, wise and good Being; that makes me the creature of an Omnipotence and Wisdom that is nowhere and everywhere; that would rob me of the exalted joy, the indestructible, sweet need to lift up my eyes in thanksgiving to a Benefactor; that in the midst of my suffering cruelly deprives me of the comfort that there is a Witness of my painful feelings and that I suffer under the rule of a Goodness mindful even of my own well-being. Schleiermacher's frank reply will be as disturbing to many religious people today as it was to Sack in 1801: No religion evolves out of the concept of the personality of God; this concept is not the source of devotion; no one is conscious of the source of 23Dilthey, Leben Schleiermachers (ed. Redeker) 1. i, 541. 24BrieJi, 3. 320 and 310. 251bid., 311.

Niebuhr, Schleiermacher on Christ and Religion (New York: Scribner's, 1964) 16. 107</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW his own devotion in that concept; more likely, the concept distorts devotion. Disturbing or not, the theological conviction Schleiermacher expresses in this passage remained consistent throughout his ca- reer. No religion evolves out of the concept of God's personality, Schleiermacher believed, because religion does not evolve out of a concept of any kind. Conceptually the Divine is ineffable. This insight is "recognized so clearly throughout the Scripture," Schlei- ermacher writes in The Christian Faith of 1821-22, "that to cite particular passages would be superfluous."27 Religion arises from no concept, but rather from our immediate self-consciousness of absolute dependence, our feeling of the inescapable givenness of our existence. This awareness, sensed immediately, supported by the whole of our experience, and thus insusceptible of rational doubt, is the root of religion. From this root theological concepts inevitably grow, and in relation to this root those concepts must always be evaluated. Those nearest to the root are most adequate to support the maturation of religion. Those more distant are less adequate. And theological concepts that have branched too far from religion's root in the feeling of absolute dependence might well require pruning away, lest they stunt or distort the growth of the whole. An illustration will make this metaphor more specific. Schleier- macher writes in The Christian Faith that of all theological con- cepts, "the concept of originating causality [Ursdchlichkeit] stands in closest connection with the feeling of absolute dependence itself."28 As an application of Schleiermacher's assertion we may observe that in the opening sections of his Institutes of the Christian Religion John Calvin speaks of God as Creator and Maker, Author and Fashioner, Fountainhead and Source.29 Each of these charac- terizations of the divine expresses originating causality, and thus each lies close to religion's root in the feeling of absolute depen- dence. Schleiermacher would admit these characterizations as ade- quate to support the further maturation of religion. He recognizes 27Schleiermacher, Der christliche Glaube, Prop. 50.3 (ed. Martin Redeker; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1960) 1. 258. Classic "particular passages" that Schleiermacher might have cited in this connection are Ps 139:6 and Isa 55:8-9. 281bid., 259. 29John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion (trans. Ford Lewis Battles; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1960) bk. 1, chap. 2, "What It Is to Know God, and to What Purpose the Knowledge of Him Tends." 108</page><page sequence="9">ALBERT L. BLACKWELL that such images for the Divine, like their underlying concept of originating causality itself, must be subjected to the theological via eminentiae or "way of removal of limits" and via negationis or "way of negation": The finitude in causality must be denied and its productivity posited as unlimited; and again, . . insofar as a number of attributes are evolved out of the divine causality, their differences represent nothing real in God.30 Thus none of Calvin's images, being finite and concrete, is finally adequate to express the divine nature. None the less, they are theologically adequate and religiously suitable insofar as they satis- fy the fundamental criterion of Schleiermacher's theology: That all the divine attributes to be dealt with in Christian dogmatics, since they are meant only to explicate the feeling of absolute dependence, must somehow go back to the divine causality.31 The fundamental images employed by Calvin-God as Creator and Maker, Author and Fashioner, Fountainhead and Source-satisfy Schleiermacher's theological criterion eminently well. But what about concepts of personality applied to God? Schleiermacher believed that in certain religious contexts, namely, in such spheres as hymnody, worship, and the immediate expres- sion of religious experience, our speaking of God in terms of personality is both inevitable and proper. In the greater exactness of theological discourse, however, the concept of personality is problematic. To attribute to God the personal quality of mercy, for example, is more appropriate to the sphere of homiletic and poetic language than to that of dogmatic language.... Preaching and poetry can afford to be less precise with anthropopathic terms.32 The theologian must recognize how closely the concept of person- ality is bound to finitude and concreteness. It does not well sustain applications of the theological via eminentiae and via negationis. It branches too far from the root of our feeling of absolute depen- dence. The concept of personality conveys not absolute origination of our existence, but rather susceptibility to our reciprocal influ- ence. This, then, is the sense in which Schleiermacher writes to 30Schleiermacher, Der christliche Glaube, Prop. 50.3, 1. 259. 31Ibid., 260. 321bid., Prop. 85.1, 1. 458. 109</page><page sequence="10">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Sack that the concept of the personality of God "is not the source of devotion ... ; more likely, the concept distorts devotion." Schleiermacher's most concentrated discussion of this contro- versial issue occurs in the "Explanations" he added to his Speeches in their revision of 1821: On the one hand, a person can recognize an appropriation of the concep- tion of a personal God as an almost unalterable necessity for the highest stage of piety, namely, wherever one interprets immediate religious emo- tions to oneself or to others, or wherever the heart is engaged in immediate communication with the Highest Being. On the other hand, the same person can recognize the essential imperfections in the conception of a personality of the Highest Being, indeed, can point out the hazard of that conception if it is not most carefully purified. The profoundest of the church fathers themselves have been ever intent upon this purification; and all told, if one assembled all their expressions intended to extirpate what is human and limited in the form of personality, it would be clear that one could just as easily say that they denied personality to God as that they attributed it to him. As it is so difficult to think of a personality as truly infinite and incapable of suffering, one should make a great distinction between a personal God and a living God. The latter concept alone offers a proper distinction from materialistic pantheism and from atheistic blind necessity.33 In summary, the charges we find Schleiermacher fending off in this Explanation of 1821-"materialistic pantheism" and "athe- istic blind necessity"-are those first expressed in Sack's letter of twenty years before. Indeed Schleiermacher is surely referring to Sack, who had died in 1817, when earlier in the same Explanation he speaks of the suspicion, "called now my atheism and now my Spinozism," which "men whom I greatly honor, some of whom have already passed away, have drawn from this Speech...."34 And from the time of his 1801 reply to Sack until his 1821 Expla- nations to the Speeches Schleiermacher's defense against these charges remained the same. First, never to speak with disdain of belief in a personal God, but rather to honor expressions of such belief in their proper spheres of hymnody, worship, and immediate religious experience. "Have I indeed spoken with contempt of... belief in a personal God?" Schleiermacher writes to Sack: 33Schleiermacher, Reden uber die Religion (ed. G. Ch. Piinjer; Braunschweig: Schwetschke, 1879) 144. Hereafter cited as Reden. Cf.

Speeches, 115. 110</page><page sequence="11">ALBERT L. BLACKWELL Never, certainly. I have only said that religion does not depend upon whether or not in abstract thought a person attributes to the infinite, supersensual Cause of the world the predicate of personality. Second, Schleiermacher's defense was to insist that in the sphere of theological discourse we more properly speak of God as living than as personal. Schleiermacher's application of this principle in his own theological work may be observed in his prolific usage of the adjective lebendig, "living," in the first edition of the Speeches in 1799, and in his summary of the "original" or most fundamen- tal attributes of God under the expressions "Absolute Inwardness" and "Absolute Vitality" in The Christian Faith of 1821-22.35 This theological language expresses Schleiermacher's romantic sense for the endless complexity, exquisite subtlety, and final incomprehen- sibility of the Divine Causality, a sense, Schleiermacher believed, that elevates his concept of a living God infinitely above any deistic concept of materialistic mechanism. In light of Schleiermacher's defenses against the charge of "materialistic pantheism" and "atheistic blind necessity" that Sack labels as his "Spinozism," we may wonder if Schleiermacher was perhaps led by a deliberate sense of irony to conclude his letter to Sack on a note closely akin to Spinoza's philosophy. In the final section of his Ethics Spinoza insists that with true knowledge comes acquiescence, with comprehension comes acceptance: In proportion as the mind understands more things .. ., it is less subject to those emotions which are evil.36 The concluding words of Schleiermacher's letter to Sack could hardly apply Spinoza's principle more directly: I close with the assurance that my sentiments toward you are still the same as ever. Our differences have long been known to me .... So much the less, therefore, could my sentiments toward you alter...; and they will not alter, either, even if, against your inclination, other convictions should necessitate your becoming my personal adversary. Sack was never to become Schleiermacher's "personal adver- sary," though after their 1801 exchange, according to the report of Sack's son, 35Reden, 50, 80, 99, and passim.

Nevertheless, it remained a bond not only of mutual high regard but also, one might say, of reserved love.37 Upon Sack's death in his eightieth year Schleiermacher wrote of him: Mild dignity, respect for differing points of view, a quiet manner, equal removal from innovation and from mechanical attachment to tradition, modest yet candid constancy: these were the principal features of his governance of the church.3 III The Sack-Schleiermacher correspondence of 1801 was first published in 1850,39 with two passages excised, as mentioned above. It is reprinted in the third volume of Schleiermacher's correspondence, published in 1861.40 Both letters are without date, but their timetable is easily established:41 the winter of 1800-1801 for Sack's composition of his letter, the summer of 1801 for the delivery of Sack's letter and for Schleiermacher's reply. So far as I am aware the following translation of the correspondence repre- sents its first publication in English. The two omissions in the German publication of Schleiermacher's letter I have indicated by the word "deletion" in brackets, and I have broken up some of the long paragraphs of the German originals. Sack's Letter to Schleiermacher You know, my dearest Schleiermacher, how highly I have valued you from the beginning of our acquaintance, and I have no doubt that you have numbered me among your sincerest friends. The talents God has bestowed upon you, the beautiful knowledge you have acquired, and the upright sense I have perceived in you have won both my high regard and my heart, and I am led to wish that you might regard yourself as one of the more intimate friends of my household.

BLACKWELL mode of living have run counter to my concepts and feelings of propriety. The taste you have appeared to have for intimate associations with persons of questionable principles and morals I could not reconcile with my concept of the taste a minister owes to himself and to his position. You know that I have not concealed my doubt about this from you, and even if you have not approved of my opinion, you certainly cannot have faulted my candor. Your work On Religion appeared. When I had read a portion of the first speech in manuscript, I formed the pleasant notion that the writing of a man of spirit would win admirers and friends for religion from among those who simply misunderstand it, and that the work was written for no other purpose than this. No doubt you recall with what enthusiasm I let you know of my delight and my hope. Meanwhile the sequel has all too soon taught me how grossly I had deceived myself. Unfortunately, I can acknowledge the book, now that I have read it through with deliberation, as nothing more than a spirited apology for pantheism, a rhetorical presentation of the Spinozistic system. Thus I now confess to you quite candidly that for me this system appears to put an end to all that religion has meant and been to me up to now, and that I hold its underlying theory to be the most desolate as well as the most pernicious, and do not know how by any manner or means to bring it into any kind of union either with a sound understanding or with the requirements of our moral nature. No more do I comprehend how a man who adheres to such a system could be an honest teacher of Christianity; for no art of sophistry and rhetoric will ever be able to convince any reasonable person that Spinozism and Christian religion can coexist. Indeed I am convinced that as a preacher you will not declaim the principles and opinions you have attempted to present in your work as the true and correct ones, with such disdainful contempt for any opposed to them. Rather, employing the common concepts of human dependence upon God and the relation with the highest Being in which we stand, and the dispositions of worship, grati- tude, obedience and trust that flow from these concepts, you will speak in rational and perhaps even biblical language; but you will do so as a man who in his heart believes nothing of all this, who merely condescends to the errors and superstition of the thought- less rabble, and who, in order not to become offensive, still uses figures of speech, though they have for himself either no meaning at all or a completely different meaning. 113</page><page sequence="14">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW A preacher who takes the universe for the deity, for whom religion is nothing more than an intuition of the universe, who recognizes absolutely no connection between religiosity and moral- ity, who despises and mocks all motivations to responsibility derived from religious concepts, who wishes to know nothing of gratitude toward an invisible, eternally living Benefactor: how pitiable a man is such a preacher! How must the ambiguity of hypocrisy and the falsification of truth, arising out of greedy self- interest or base considerations of human fear or favor, chastise his heart with every word he speaks from the pulpit! Solve for me the riddle of how an occupation can still please you that must necessarily appear to you as the fruit and furtherance of silliness and superstition, how you can bring continuance in this occupation for reasons of convenience into harmony with your own feeling for the right. I can imagine that a Spinoza might have been at peace with himself, and perhaps even happy; but that he would have been so as an appointed teacher of Christian religion, having to teach publicly exactly the opposite of his philosophy-that I doubt. It is to his credit, therefore, that despite his poverty he declined the professorial chair offered him at Heidelberg. Or perhaps in this connection you have formed for yourself a principle unknown to me and do not consider it improper to use words designating religious objects, even though you hold the sense attached to them by common usage to be nonsense. According to the cleverness of some of the new philosophers it is allowable and expedient to concede the words "God," "religion," "providence," "future life" their place for a while longer, and then to subordinate them little by little to other concepts, until one no longer needs them and can without any danger omit them. According to my view of the matter, my dearest Preacher, the desire to pioneer a new way for yourself and a shying away from whatever is common, coupled with speculative sagacity and a blossoming imagination, have led you astray into a byway-and according to my most inward conviction, it is an unfortunate byway. To think this of you without telling you seems to me against the duty of friendship and against my other obligations to you and to myself as well. I know very well that this declaration of my disaccord with you in matters I consider to be humanity's most holy and most urgent can contribute absolutely nothing toward altering your opinions and thoughts in any way. I know also that in the circle in which you live, men like me are held to be feeble- minded, whose judgment, in contrast to the powerful and mighty 114</page><page sequence="15">ALBERT L. BLACKWELL decrees of those who look down upon even Leibniz, Locke, Garve, Engel, etc., as upon poor half-wits, carries absolutely no weight. But heaven knows that I am writing this not to sway you to another opinion, but only in order not to leave you in uncer- tainty about my own. I do not wish by any means to despise, disparage or condemn anyone; but I despise, disparage and con- demn without reservation the (so-called) philosophy-execrable, in my view-that acknowledges at the summit of the universe no self-conscious, wise and good Being; that makes me the creature of an Omnipotence and Wisdom that is nowhere and everywhere; that would rob me of the exalted joy, the indestructible, sweet need to lift up my eyes in thanksgiving to a Benefactor; that in the midst of my suffering cruelly deprives me of the comfort that there is a Witness of my painful feelings and that I suffer under the rule of a Goodness mindful even of my own well-being. I despise and condemn the slippery tolerance that opens the gate of religion's temple no less obligingly to idolatry, to fanaticism, to wickedness than to the wise and the good who strive after truth and virtue. I regard as surpassingly disgraceful and pernicious the revolutionary new school that upsets and demolishes everything with a wanton hand, that makes of the most beautiful and fruitful field of human thought and belief a bleak and desolate desert in which not even a single tree any longer gives shade, not one blade any longer grows, not one spring any longer ripples. Equally disgraceful to me is the revolutionary new language that in spite of the first rule of all rational speech and instruction, namely, intelligibility, always trades in false coinage, cloaks itself in enigmatic darkness, and, fearing that it may express itself com- monly, becomes bombastic, exactly like a person who, merely to appear larger than others, goes about on stilts. A man as well acquainted with the noble simplicity of the Greeks as you should at least disdain this pompous and tasteless style, leaving it to the enthusiasts and poeticizing jokesters who content themselves with the adulation and praise of susceptible little old ladies starved for culture. Sharp renunciation in matters of this kind is not merely a necessary requisite for, but indeed the very mark of a true philosopher. One who poses paradoxes has, in my opinion, a double necessity to contain himself within the bounds of modesty. My dearest Schleiermacher! Had my heart hung less on you, had I not placed so much value upon the hope that you would have the strength and will to erect a sturdy dam against the stream of sophistry characteristic of our age, then it would not be so 115</page><page sequence="16">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW grievous to me that you, of all people, have allowed yourself to be swept away by this very stream. Your deliverances from the pulpit, I am certain, are useful; the understanding and the heart of your listeners are won over by them-but only of those listeners, surely, who have no knowledge or presentiment of your real system. Do you wish, then, to be of future use only to these latter listeners, but by all the others-and among them there are certainly very many worthy of attention whose religiosity still attaches to belief in an existing and governing God, and for whom death is something other than a vanishing into the universe-by all these others could you wish to be shunned? Also, for reasons of self-interest, I am grieved that in all that you may now say or write about religious matters, however true it may be and however admirably it may be stated, for me there is in fact no more nourishment to be found; for I am not master over the impression made upon me by unavoidable associations of ideas. Thus, with heartfelt sorrow, I take my leave of you. Your way is not mine. I hope that we shall someday find each other again. Whether you will turn to me or I will come around to you, time will tell. Schleiermacher's Reply to Sack Yes, my honorable Chaplain, an open declaration is better than an uncommunicated judgment, and I can say that I have long wished for the former. More I could not do, for an accusation must first be expressed before a defense can follow. It is true, as you mention, that by word of mouth you have already revealed to me your opinion concerning the object of your letter. Yet unfortu- nately, as valuable as this instance of frankness-like every such instance-has been to me, something has always hindered its appropriate outcome: at one time you appeared not to wish to enter into objections; at another, the time for a proper discussion was lacking; at still another, circumstances were not suitable. All of this goes better in writing, and thus I thank you cordially for having finally put aside old affections sufficiently to send me the letter so long intended for me. If the sermons I sent have given you a fresh inducement to do so, then that is already a very valuable fruit of their publication. Allow me now, without further preface, to begin where your letter begins: with what is undoubtedly your most longstanding point of contention, namely, your displeasure concerning my associations and friendships. Your letter refers to persons of 116</page><page sequence="17">ALBERT L. BLACKWELL questionable principles and morals with whom I am supposed to stand in intimate association; and wherever I look in the limited circle of my relations or in your previous intimations, I find only Friedrich Schlegel to whom this reference can relate. [Deletion.] Only a single time-and it was the last time I had the pleasure of seeing you in your home-only once, in the course of two years' close friendship between him and me, have you expressed yourself on this subject. It was not the candor of your remark that estranged me from your home, dearest Chaplain, but rather the particular form it took: expressions that in the mouth of as fine and circumspect a man as you seemed so calculated that I did not want to expose myself to the danger of hearing them repeated. Our conversation was at that time interrupted; allow me to pick it up again. Schlegel wrote Lucinde, a book one could not thoroughly defend without writing another book, and which I would not wish to defend entirely, since it contains, alongside much that is praise- worthy and beautiful, some things that I cannot condone. But does it proclaim pernicious principles and morals? If someone wishes to express in an example a theory he has formulated concerning the sphere of poetic presentation, this has nothing to do with his character. And immoral ulterior motives or arbitrary outbursts of more inward immorality I for my part have not found in Lucinde, though I have found them aplenty in many German and French poets whom no one anathematizes and reviles. In comparison with these, my friend appears to me like an artist who paints an unclothed Venus, as contrasted with an oriental sultan who allows voluptuous dances to be performed by living bodies in the pres- ence of children. [Deletion.] I shall never be the intimate friend of a person of reprehensible views. But neither shall I ever, out of fear of human opinion, deny the comfort of friendship to a person outlawed yet innocent; never shall I act merely on the basis of my position rather than the true facts of the matter, or let myself be led by an appearance hovering in the mind of someone else. For if we surrendered to such a maxim, we preachers would in fact be outlaws in the realm of society; every calumny against a friend, if it were well enough fabricated to be believable, could banish us from him. Further- more, the goal I have set before myself is this: in time, by means of an irreproachable, consistent life, to bring it to pass that an undeserved bad reputation of my friends cannot cast an injurious light upon me, but rather that my friendship for them can cast a favorable light upon their reputation. 117</page><page sequence="18">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW The second chief point of your letter concerns my Speeches on Religion. Here I must first protest most earnestly against your view of this book. It is supposed to be an apology for pantheism, a presentation of the Spinozistic philosophy? Something spoken of only parenthetically on a few pages is supposed to be the main point? And the entire first speech, where you yourself find nothing of the like, and a great part of the second and the third and fourth and fifth, in all of which the talk concerns things altogether different in kind-in short, almost the whole book is supposed to be merely an idle adjunct to these few pages? You say that I am a pantheist, that religion is wholly opposed to this system, and at the same time you say that I speak of opposed ways of thinking with disdainful contempt! Have I indeed spoken with contempt of religion, in the sense in which you take the word, or of belief in a personal God? Never, certainly. I have only said that religion does not depend upon whether or not in abstract thought a person attributes to the infinite, supersensual Cause of the world the predicate of personality. In this connection, though I am as little a Spinozist as anyone, I introduced Spinoza as an example, because throughout his Ethics a sensibility prevails that one can only call piety. From the fact that some people attribute personality to God while others do not, I have shown that the ground lies in differing tendencies of mind and heart, and at the same time that neither of these tendencies hinders religion. Now from this one must discern that without a certain degree of anthropomorphism nothing in religion can be grasped in words-a principle to which you yourself, honorable Sir, hold fast. And I agree with you, as you can discover throughout the Speeches. But of course this principle is not limited to the metaphysical concept of the personality of God, and, not depending upon that concept, must therefore also be admitted to exist even in the religion of those whose metaphysics does not allow this predicate for the Deity. Conversely, no religion evolves out of the concept of the personality of God; this concept is not the source of devotion; no one is conscious of the source of his own devotion in that concept; more likely, the concept distorts devotion. This anthropomorphism prevails even in Scripture, in the words of Jesus, in Christianity generally. Whether this metaphysi- cal concept of personality has always been bound to Christianity, however, is an entirely different question. Today's common con- cept of God is composed of the features of transcendence, person- ality, and infinity, and it is destroyed whenever one of these is lacking. But whether these have always been so formulated? And 118</page><page sequence="19">ALBERT L. BLACKWELL if many people have been called Christians who have given little heed to the infinity of God, could not a person also be a Christian whose philosophy gives little heed to one of the other two features ? In the midst of the present-day storm of philosophical opinions my goal has been to present correctly and to establish the indepen- dence of religion from every metaphysics. Thus the thought of a conflict between my religion and Christianity on account of some philosophical conception has never arisen in me, nor has it ever occurred to me to regard myself as the servant of a superstition I find despicable. On the contrary, I am quite convinced that I truly have the religion I am supposed to preach, even if I should have a philosophy wholly other than the typical philosophy of those who hear me. Equally little is there in me any unworthy cleverness or reservatio mentalis; rather, I attribute to words exactly the meaning that people attribute to them insofar as they are grasped by religious contemplation. I simply do not accept any other meaning besides. This same goal was in my mind as I communicated my opinion concerning the relation of religion to morality. I have said clearly enough not to need to repeat it, that just because I declare that religion is not necessarily in the service of morality, I do not therefore hold religion to be something empty. I have said clearly enough that I consider our church as presently constituted to be a double institution, dedicated in part to religion and in part to morality. Thus I believe I am doing neither something contrary to my conviction nor something insignificant when I speak to people of religion as to those who should at the same time be moral, and of morality as to those who at the same time support religion-and of both, according to the relation I find appropriate at the time. What is more, I consider the position of a preacher the most noble of positions, worthily filled only by a truly religious, virtuous, and earnest mind and heart, and never of my own choice will I exchange this position for another. Even if you could not declare the same yourself, honorable Sir, still how could you fall into the supposition suggested by your letter: that I remain a preacher out of self-interested motives? In fact you will have to admit that in any other career I would soon attain the modest income that my office furnishes me (and I do not reckon upon receiving much more). Or am I supposed to remain a preacher out of the attempt to win human favor? From my circle of friends? You must surely realize that they would be uncommonly glad to see me no longer a preacher. From the 119</page><page sequence="20">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW world? My entire life gives proof that I lay no worth on the approbation of those who do not know me. From certain particular patrons? I have none. Or finally, out of fear of others? Indeed! There is no living being upon whom I am dependent, and I pride myself on being as free as anyone on earth. Have you in fact ever in my life seen me do anything out of these motives? If so, then I wonder how you could have granted me your high regard. If you have not, then how does it happen that at this moment you suddenly attribute to me maxims that otherwise I do not follow? Such maxims tend to be the case throughout humankind, it is true. But this very pattern undercuts your other declaration: that my way of thinking is grounded in a search for the extraordinary and the uncommon. In fact my way of thinking has no other ground than my own character, my inborn mysticism, my cultivation, proceeding outward from within. May it happen that through this discussion I shall succeed, if not in making my theories acceptable to you, at least in justifying my course of actions and in shifting somewhat more of the good opinion you still appear to have of my talents over to my character. Should it happen that even after this discussion as much as before, nothing I am able to say or write about religious matters can please you, that would pain me terribly, but I would know nothing more to do. If by the publication of these Speeches I have in actuality weakened my usefulness as a preacher, I am not to blame. I knew full well that many would not be in a position to separate their metaphysics and their religion, that my Speeches would inspire no heartfelt zeal for religion in anyone indifferent to a metaphysics other than his own, and that to such persons I would not be able to explain myself more clearly. For this reason, and for this reason alone, I did not set my name upon the book and earnestly did whatever I could to have it remain unknown. That I did not attain this goal is not my fault but rather the fault of Berlin's home- grown literary curiosity seekers and gossipers. In order not to lengthen this out too greatly I gladly pass over what your letter contains of a purely literary nature. One thing only I cannot leave untouched, for it has sickened me bitterly. Because I (for you know it is I) have passed straightforward albeit strong judgments upon Engel, Garve and Leibnitz as authors, I am supposed to have passed a judgment upon their personal worth- your expression for which I do not care to repeat? How does that follow? I touch upon this only and say nothing more. Rather I close with the assurance that my sentiments toward you are still the same as ever. Our differences have long been 120</page><page sequence="21">ALBERT L. BLACKWELL 121 known to me. I knew the things about me that displeased you and the things about my sensibilities that you were judging unfairly. I could foresee that if ever you suspended your fragile indulgence for these points, if ever you confused the fatherly friend and the superior charged with authority, a relationship of great worth to me would suddenly be destroyed. So much the less, therefore, could my sentiments toward you alter when this actually ensued; and they will not alter, either, even if, against your inclination, other convictions should necessitate your becoming my personal adversary.</page></plain_text>
