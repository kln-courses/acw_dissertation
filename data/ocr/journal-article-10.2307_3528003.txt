<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Legacy of Hans Jonas I 3 Appreciating The Phenomenon of Life by Leon R. Kass It is twenty-six years since I first met Hans Jonas in the pages of his book, The Phenome- non of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology. I was then a practicing biochemist working at the National Institutes of Health. But I was a some- what eccentric biochemist, both because I had ac- quired a moralist's interest in the meaning of the new biology and, even more, because I had a vague interest in the philosophy of organism, secretly har- boring inarticulate yet definite nonreductionist preju- dices. My closest friend, having read "Is God a Mathematician? (The Meaning of Metabolism)," strongly recommended that I read The Phenomenon of Life, whose paperback edition had just appeared. I took the book with me on our family vacation in West Virginia, and pored over it steadily for two weeks. It left me out of breath from the intellectual effort needed to comprehend the dense and sophis- ticated philosophical arguments (and the author's Germanic style). At the same time, I was exhilarated to discover that there was indeed a way to philoso- phize nonreductively about living nature, including man, even in the face of the great accomplishments of modern biology. A few months later, in the autumn of 1969, I met Hans Jonas in the flesh. I had organized the first NIH Symposium on Ethical Issues in Biomedical Advance and, mainly because I wanted to meet him, invited Hans to be the moderator. "Look for a short man with a briefcase, holding a cigarette in the Euro- pean manner," said my prescient wife as I left for the airport to meet my esteemed guest. Following her advice, I picked him out immediately and we soon fell into lively conversation. The next few days were exhilarating. Hans not only moderated with skill and grace; with his opening and closing remarks and his other substantive interventions, he gave the whole Leon R Kass is Addie Clark Harding Professor, The Com- mittee on Social Thought and The College, The University of Chicago.

In the years that followed, Hans and I became colleagues at The Hastings Center, mainly as mem- bers of the Task Force on Death and Dying. I recall that he served as a commentator on my first paper, on the immorality of human cloning, and his gener- ous and enthusiastic endorsement of my arguments encouraged me greatly. Within the year, inspired largely by his example and that of Paul Ramsey, I took a leave of absence from the laboratory and be- gan a career, first in biomedical ethics, more recently in the humanities more generally, seeking to build bridges between science and ethics, between nature and human affairs. As part of my inquiry, I have, on four or five occasions over the past eighteen years, taught a course on the organism, in each case read- ing The Phenomenon of Life as the culminating work. My students, like me before them, have found it im- mensely difficult but immensely rewarding. Two have gone on to write outstanding doctoral dissertations in the history of science, inspired by what they first came to see in this course, thanks to The Phenomenon of Life. Several who are now practicing biologists are keenly aware of the limitations of the objectified view of life and hope in their own work to exhibit alter- native ways of thinking and speaking. My own work continues to be nurtured by what I have learned from this and other of Hans's writings and from the friendship we developed over the years. Though I was never formally his student, Hans was and remains my teacher, even about the worthwhileness of teach- ing. He strongly encouraged me to accept my teach- ing position at The University of Chicago; and when I would occasionally become discouraged about the worthwhileness of teaching and writing, he would boost my spirits, once quoting Ecclesiastes: "Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it in the end of days." By happy accident-or was it providence?-I once got the opportunity to return a small portion of the bread Hans had cast in my direction. One day, when my class was discussing The Phenomenon of Life, a stu- dent brought a visitor to class, whom she introduced as the daughter of the author. I was honored and</page><page sequence="2">4 I Hastings Center Report, Special Issue, 1995 delighted by her presence, and gladly gave permis- sion for her to sit in. The students were, as usual, lively and serious in discussion, keenly aware of what was at stake. Afterwards I was eager to know what my guest had made of it all. "You know," she said with evident sincerity and gratitude, "I never knew before that what my father did was really important." I am not sure I have ever had a more gratifying ex- perience in the classroom. The phenomenon of life occasions many wonders. Such thoughts deter- mined me to try to pre- sent, in brief, a personal appreciation of The Phe- Jonas shows both nomenon of Life, my first real teacher in philosoph- the special discon ical biology. I have long within the domai thought to write a review essay of this underappre- ciated book, hoping thereby to bring it more of the attention it de- serves. Sometimes, when teaching it, I even had fan- tasies about translating it into American English in order to improve its accessibility-for Hans, I suspect, thought the book out first in German and, in any case, made little allowance for the fact that American students lack the philosophical sophistication needed to enter comfortably into concepts and arguments which, to the European-educated scholar, were sec- ond nature. Here I must content myself with this much more modest offering. My appreciation com- prises three parts: first, some overall remarks, large and small; next, a more careful look at one of the central ideas of the book; finally, some further thoughts about this idea, prompted by the book but going beyond it. I shall make liberal use of the author's own words, that we might again hear him speak. i th tint n c Some Overall Appreciations, General and Particular First, I appreciate greatly the philosophical am- bition of this book. Here is the goal toward which it aims, as Jonas puts it at the start of the introduction: A philosophy of life comprises the philoso- phy of the organism and the philosophy of mind. This is itself a first proposition of the philosophy of life, in fact its hypothesis, which it must make good in the course of execution. For the statement of scope ex- presses no less than the contention that the organic even in its lowest forms prefigures mind, and that mind even on its highest reaches remains part of the organic. The lat- ter half of the contention, but not the for- mer, is in tune with modern belief; the for- mer, but not the latter, was in tune with an- cient belief: that both are valid and insepara- ble is the hypothesis of a philosophy that tries for a stand beyond the quarrel of the ancients and the moderns. (p. 1)1 To pursue his goal, Jonas must first address the obstacles placed in his way by the major currents of modern thought, philosophic and scientific. And ad- dress them he does, fully aware that he sails against the stream. Offering what he calls "an 'existential' interpretation of biological facts" (p. ix), he seeks to correct the errors of both our anthropocentric ide- alist and existentialist philosophy and our materialist scientific biology. The former makes the mistake of treating man in isolation from the rest of living nature and therefore fails to see that the great ie continuity and human "contradictions" it r te hi of freedom and necessity, ity of the human autonomy and depen- )f the living. dence, self and world, re- lation and isolation, crea- tivity and mortality all have their beginnings in even the most primitive forms of life, "each pre- cariously balanced between being and not-being, and each endowed with an internal horizon of 'transcen- dence"' (p. ix). The latter makes the mistake of ig- noring entirely the inward dimension of all that lives, and therefore fails to understand the difference be- tween the nonliving and the living. Jonas seeks a new, post-dualistic view of life, one which would again see each organism as a psychophysical unity, the living concretion of embodied inwardness or of feeling-and- striving body. At the same time, he seeks to elaborate a view that does justice to the hierarchical character of life, a view that could also do justice to the specific difference and unquestionable superiority of the hu- man animal. Measured against such a grand ambition, the book can be hailed as only an incomplete success. The Phenomenon of Life is, in fact, a collection of essays, written over a period of more than fifteen years, and by the author's own admission, not yet a systematic statement of a philosophy of life (hence the subtitle, "Toward a Philosophical Biology"). Yet it does convey in bold relief what Jonas called the "emergent essence" (p. 6) of what such a finished theory would be; and that "emergent essence" suf- fices to establish some major triumphs on the road to a full philosophical biology, true to the phenom- ena of life. Jonas succeeds in showing that and how every living organism is a psychophysical unity, arche- typically concrete, a grown-togetherness of organized outwardly perceivable matter and inwardly experi- enceable feeling-and-awareness. Refuting the corpore- alist prejudice, he restores the primacy of form to its proper place as an independent cause of the phe- nomena of life, but on grounds perfectly compatible with scientific findings and the theory of evolution. He also succeeds in refuting the homogenizing ten- dency of evolutionary biology, which denies the dis- tinction between higher and lower forms of life, by elaborating the ontological ground for a hierarchical view of life. He shows the necessity of teleologic no- tions for a true account of life. And he shows both</page><page sequence="3">The Legacy of Hans onas I 5 the continuity and the special discontinuity of the human within the domain of the living. These are no small accomplishments. Next, I appreciate the vast learning that informs the book, which covers topics ranging from the me- tabolism of an amoeba to the meaning of immortal- ity. There are discussions of Orphic religion, natural selection, gnosticism, DNA, ancient versus modern mathematics, cybernetics, the relative strengths and weaknesses of seeing, hearing, and tactile-feeling, the being of images, theory versus practice, the images of man and the image of God. Major human figures, from Adam and Anaxagoras to Alfred North White- head, dance in and out of the argument, as do the teachings of the great philosophers of the West, an- cient and modern. And then there are the appendi- ces to the various chapters, set aside for the more metaphysically inclined. These little gems constitute all by themselves a profound offering on many major questions in philosophy: causality and percep- tion; anthropomorphism; the meaning of Cartesian- ism for the theory of life; the Greek use of mathe- matics in the interpretation of nature; materialism, determinism, and the mind; sight and movement; and the origins of the experience of truth. Yet even more to be admired than its erudition is the philosophical passion of the book, so wonder- fully true to the man who wrote it. For here is a book written under the now unfashionable view that philosophy is the passionate pursuit of wisdom, a zealous quest for the deepest insight into the most important matters. Here is a book that, for all its learning, is preeminently the profession of a man who could not content himself with erudition but who took it as his mission to help us find our way in a world intellectually confused by the cacophony of modern thought and morally shattered by the un- speakable horrors of twentieth century politics. De- spite what he had personally seen and endured, Hans Jonas philosophizes here with a love of life and a love of humanity fully equal to his love of truth; and like all genuine philosophers since Socrates, he places a concern for the human good at the center of his desire to know the truth. Though the argu- ments are often abstract and technical, though Jonas offers no royal road or easy answers, The Phenomenon of Life is a work not only of masterful philosophical sophistication but also of enthusiasm and inspiration; it serves, if I may say so, as a standing rebuke to those who think that "doing philosophy" is an activity for a deracinated logos, seeking a "truth" which consists only in the noninconsistency of verbal statements. Descending from these most general apprecia- tions to the most highly particular, I note my delight in some of Hans's more pithy and pregnant formu- lations. Here are three of my favorites. First, from the introduction: After expressing a philosopher's dissatisfaction with the scientist's view that the vast landscape of life on our planet is the result of blind chance and necessity working on the indifferent elements, "accidentally giving rise to the subjective phenomena that inexplicably adhere to them as a redundant by-play," he writes: "Rather, since matter gave such account of itself, namely did in fact organize itself in this manner and with these re- sults, it ought to be given its due, and the possibility for doing what it did should be attributed to it as residing in its primary nature: this genuine potency must then be included in the very concept of physi- cal 'substance"' (pp. 1-2). The arresting phrase, "matter gave such account of itself," comprises a double-entendre: first, taken metaphorically and as stated, matter acted in such and such a way, that is, it organized itself so that feeling life emerged and matter acquired in- wardness; but second, taken literally, organized "mat- ter" (taking the form of the modern scientist) even- tually spoke this verbal account, told this story of "it- self' and its doings. But if such human speech is an outgrowth, and perhaps the pinnacle, of matter's self-organizing deed, then its emergence testifies that matter must be more than what those scientific speakers say it is. Matter must be the kind of thing that is already potentially mindful. Indeed, if one ponders the remark further, one sees that the scien- tists' claim for the truth of corporealism must, on their own premises, be dubious at best; for all claims to truth require that mind have at least epistemic independence from the flux of dumb matter. Second: Toward the end of the chapter "Phil- osophical Aspects of Darwinism" Jonas remarks that "the triumph which materialism achieved in Darwinism contains the germ of its own overcom- ing" (p. 53). For almost no one has noticed that "evolution precisely abolished the special position of man which warranted the Cartesian treatment of all the remainder": In the hue and cry over the indignity done to man's metaphysical status in the doctrine of his animal descent, it was overlooked that by the same token some dignity had been restored to the realm of life as a whole. If man was the relative of animals, then animals were the relatives of man, and in degrees bear- ers of that inwardness of which man, the most advanced of their kin, is conscious in himself. (p. 57) To be akin to the animals is to belong to the family of life. Though man remains distinct, because of self- consciousness and all that that entails, he is not alone-he is not an alien or freak in the mindless cosmic story. Man's metaphysical status, paradoxically, may have improved because of his newly recognized relations. Third: In "Is God a Mathematician?" Jonas asks how we know that the apparent wholeness, unity, identity, and individuality of organisms is real rather than merely apparent or phenomenal. How do we know that metabolism is a function of the whole or- ganism, rather than that the organism's apparent wholeness is merely a function of metabolism? Be- cause, says Jonas, "being living bodies ourselves, we hap- pen to have inside knowledge" (p. 79). What is this wondrous inside knowledge? Inside of what? What</page><page sequence="4">6 I Hastings Center Report, Special Issue, 1995 kind of knowledge? "On the strength of the imme- diate testimony of our bodies, we are able to say what no disembodied onlooker would have a cause for say- ing: [that life is] self-centered individuality, being for itself and in contraposition to all the rest of the world, with an essential boundary dividing 'inside' and 'outside'-notwithstanding, nay, on the basis of the actual exchange" (p. 79). We are living bodies; that is, we are self-identical to our living bodies. Yet this is not quite the whole story. For, being also mys- teriously doubled "inside," this articulate we can re- port what our bodies silently and immediately "tell" us We are living bod about our own being and self-identical to c its wholeness: we know, tacitly but absolutely, be- Yet this is not qi cause of our own bodily striving, that we are indivi- duals, that we are unities, that we seek and strive for persistence and for dura- tion of our own existence, that this involves effort, effort over-against, effort over-against a counterpoised world, from which and against which we actively se- cure our continuance. These are no self-flattering in- ventions of consciousness or mind; rather, they are, so to speak, the true "speech" of the silent body, which silent logos it manages, mysteriously, to send up to the powers of self-awareness and articulation. This is insider's knowledge of the very inside, knowl- edge of the core, or center of the only being whose center we can access because we "reside" at-indeed we are-that center. One might even say that this inside knowledge is the inside of all knowledge. There is no knowledge more certain than this: not "I am a thinking thing," but "I am a striving, indi- visible, self-concerned self." "I need and I strive, therefore I am." Appreciating the Passionate Nature of Life Moving beyond these overall remarks, I wish next to pursue one prominent theme of The Phenomenon of Life, itself the central feature of living phenomena, this very matter of need and striving, what for short I shall call the appetitive or passionate nature of life. I am drawn to this topic not only because of its vital importance, but because it may shed some light also on our author, whose passionate way of living and philosophizing I have already emphasized and ad- mired. A few preliminary comments will locate the subject in Jonas's overall argument. Beginning with and rejecting the polar opposite teachings of scientific materialism and anthropocen- tric idealism, Jonas nonetheless starts his inquiry from the scientific side, and not only because it holds sway in our present age. Materialism is the more in- teresting and serious ontological view because, within its concern for bodies in general, it must confront the living body and hence test its principles on this most challenging limit case. Idealism, and the ontol- ogy of pure consciousness, on the other hand, which is "as little alive as the pure matter confronting it" (p. 21), will never need to face up to the problem of the living body or the reality of death. But, as Jonas next argues, in the passage I quoted from the second essay, "Philosophical Aspects of Darwinism," materialism ironically undermines it- self precisely in its triumphant success in offering a purely naturalistic and nonteleological account of animal evolution, includ- ies; that is, we are )ur living bodies. aite the whole story. ing the rise of man. Thus human inwardness or sub- jectivity-thinking, feeling, imagining, desiring, will- ing-now belongs to the story of life as a whole, and, unless one holds that inwardness was suddenly and miraculously intro- duced into the human animal from some outside source, one must consider the strong possibility that the seeds of inwardness are contained in simpler ani- mals, and then, by the same argument, contained also in the simplest living beings. The proof that this is indeed the case is the work of the third essay, "Is God a Mathematician? (The Meaning of Metabo- lism)," a veritable tour de force. Here Jonas first shows that the living form has a persistence and an independence from its own ma- terials, gained despite-indeed because of-the flux of these materials in metabolism. Next he shows that this persistence is itself an achievement of the form, which guides the animal's traffickings in materials. It follows, therefore, that feeding and metabolism nec- essarily entail for living things a new and distinctive relation-to-the-world. Unlike nonliving things that persist inertially as what they are, immediately self- identical and without any need to maintain their self- identity through their own efforts, living things must constantly work to maintain both their existence and their self-identity, in the face of ever-present dangers of going out of business. Metabolism is a full-time occupation from which only death provides release. The organism's ability to endure as an able-bodied being means that nourishment is a continuous neces- sity. An organism's ability to metabolize is inseparable from its absolute need to do so. The organism's in- dependence as a self is inseparable from its absolute dependence on what lies beyond its borders. Thus, with the emergence of life, even in its most elementary forms, comes the emergence of a genu- ine "self"-a distinct and separate being, potent but perishable, which persists by its own performance in metabolism and self-nourishing-pitted against but in active commerce with a correlative "world" in which, from which, and against which it acts to maintain itself. The neediness of living things, not shared by self-sufficing inanimate matter, drives the organism into genuine relations with its surrounding environ- ment, for which there are no precedents among non- living things. Indeed, it is only living things that</page><page sequence="5">The Legacy of Hans Jonas | 7 have-and have a relation to-an environment, and not merely contiguous, adjacent, and neutral space. This need-inspired world-relation entails-necessar- ily-all the essential powers of life, powers present to an organism here and now but exercised always in relation to what is beyond and not yet. All animals- even the simplest or lowest-possess (even if only as rudiments) the great powers of action, awareness, and appetite. The need for outside material means that organ- isms must be capable of reaching out to obtain it-to find it, appropriate it, and transform it. They must be able to act in and on the world. In mammals, the distance-effacing and world-altering character of chas- ing, capturing, and devouring are self-evident, as are the innate powers to move, grasp, bite, and crush which are manifested in these activities. But simpler animals are also agents of change and worldly trans- formation. Barnacles and other filter feeders do not chase their victims, but they hold and destroy them nonetheless. By means of pseudopodia, an amoeba approaches, surrounds, and then engulfs its food. Even inanimate food can be actively pursued; some species of bacteria propel themselves along concen- tration gradients, seeking and consuming those sug- ars (or other carbon sources) that are most effi- ciently metabolized. Granted, these "actions" are per- formed and these powers are exercised "automat- ically," without deliberation or conscious intention; and one could argue, rightly, that we do not here have action in the full sense. Still, the doings of living things are spontaneously done, exercising immanent powers adapted for such exercise, and the transfor- mations wrought are real and large-in the aggre- gate, massive. To live, every living being disturbs and alters its surrounding world, each in its own charac- teristic ways, though it seeks in fact not "world al- teration" but only its own persistence. Actions on the world in food-seeking are gener- ally fairly specific; only some parts of the environ- ment are regarded as nourishing. Discriminate action implies discriminate awareness. And awareness, too, is present-even if in only rudimentary form-al- ready in the simplest forms of life. Specific nutrients are actively transported even in single-celled animals and bacteria. Such active transport involves the pres- ence of specific proteins, located at the cell bound- ary, that recognize, selectively bind, and carry inside the desired nutrient. And, again, even at these lowest levels, awareness is awareness of form: bacterial trans- port systems can discriminate between D and L stereoisomers of the same sugar, which differ not in their chemical composition but only in their three- dimensional geometrical form. Biological transforma- tion of the world presupposes information about the world; powers to alter the outside world necessarily coincide with powers to perceive it, and both are born with life itself. But simple awareness of some outside edible is insufficient to account for the action of self-nourish- ment. Something must "take an interest in" the per- ceived edible object, something must energize the living being into action. In short, something like "concern" or "felt need" or "appetite" is also re- quired. In higher animals, awareness of an edible be- ing or object leads to eating only because-and if- hunger or felt lack is present. But the essence of what, in such higher beings, comes to be manifest to feel- ing or conscious experience is already (uncon- sciously) present to the simplest forms-albeit "un- known" to any mind. What moves an organism to feed is not merely the sensed and registered pres- ence or absence of a certain chemical or edible be- ing in its environment, but the inner needy state of the organism for whom such an absence is a lack, an absence to be overcome or remedied. Bacteria do not measure the concentration of glucose in their environment in the indifferent and detached way of the biochemist who prepared their growth medium. Not the numerical measure itself, but the immanent "perception" that it represents a potential fulfill- ment of a lack, leads to the activities of "chasing" and selective absorption. Here we see a refutation of the impoverished and faulty explanation of stimulus-response theory, which attempts a strictly mechanistic account of behavior: An organism would not "respond" to perceived food "stimuli" were it not an "interested" or "appetitive" being, were it not al- ready internally ordered toward the necessary activi- ties of self-nourishing. As with action and awareness, the seeds of appetite are co-present with life. Indeed, the germ of appetite governs, guides, and integrates awareness and action: appetite or desire, not DNA, is the deepest principle of life. It is Jonas's account of the growth of this germ that I wish now to examine. The essential aspects of life-needful freedom; selfhood set against otherness; world relation through the activities of sensitivity, concern, and reaching- outward in action-all present rudimentarily even in bacteria and amoebae, become more developed and rich as animals become more complex. In the fourth essay, "To Move and To Feel: On the Animal Soul," Jonas shows how the basic rudiments of life's powers are raised to a higher level in animals. Mere irrita- bility, the sensitivity to stimuli, grows up into percep- tion and awareness of an outside world, a true world of discrete objects. Mere outward-reaching, the ability to appropriate needed materials from outside one's boundary, grows up into locomotion and other mo- tor powers, which permit the animal to reach and act upon the perceived objects of the world. And mere "self-concern," that ineffable motive force that drives the organism into commerce with the world to satisfy basic need, grows up into appetite, desire, and emotion. It is this last aspect that we shall follow most closely. Indeed, we are invited to do so by the title of this essay, "To Move and To Feel," which ties moving to feeling, and which identifies this linked pair of activities as the heart of the animal soul. (By the way, the word "soul" here should especially at- tract our interest. Though Jonas refers to soul more than twenty times in the book as a whole, in every other case he is describing the views of someone else, usually from remote antiquity. Only here, in this es- say, does he dare to use the philosophically long-</page><page sequence="6">8 I Hastings Center Report, Special Issue, 1995 abandoned notion of soul in his own name, and to attribute it not merely to human beings but to ani- mals. To be more precise, he speaks of "the animal soul," generically, and he does so only in the title; the word "soul" does not occur in the essay itself. We are moved to wonder what he meant by "soul" and also whether he really meant to use it-questions to which I shall shortly return.) "To Move and To Feel" begins with this fact: the life of motile animals is an advance beyond that of plants and the simpler and immobile animals thanks to the emergence of the three powers of animal life: motility, perception, and emotion. These powers, tied to the development of specific sense organs, defined motor structures, and central nervous system, make it possible for animals to have a genuine relation to a genuinely articulated world. On the side of aware- ness, the world of objects is increasingly disclosed to the animal; on the side of action, the animal has greater range and freedom to move and do and, ac- cordingly, greater commerce with other beings through self-assertion; and, inwardly, there is enhanced de- marcation of individuated selfhood, experienced in the emotions that accompany success or failure in the businesses of life. These three powers are, in fact, all manifestations of a common principle, tied to a common fact about animal life. The common fact: the mobile animals live at greater distance from their relevant environments; therefore-the common prin- ciple-animal life is mediated life, animal life is rooted in the gap between subject and object, which gap is spanned by the distance-disclosing and distance- bridging powers of perception, locomotion, and ap- petite. Jonas argues, persuasively, that appetite is the heart of animality, prior to the more externally rec- ognizable powers of perception and locomotion. Animal locomotion is generally not aimless; it is motion toward or motion away, pursuit or flight. But such protracted motions, say, for example, the pur- suit of prey, require "continuous emotional intent." "Greed is at the bottom of the chase, fear at the bottom of flight" (p. 101). To be sure, the apprehen- sion of a distant object requires distance perception, and its attainment across the distance requires con- trolled locomotion. "But to experience the distantly perceived as a goal and to keep its goal quality alive, so as to carry the motion over the necessary span of effort and time, desire is required" (p. 101). Desire is itself a manifestation of a gap-not spatial, but temporal-between present felt need and future an- ticipated satisfaction: "[W]ithout the tension of dis- tance and the deferment necessitated by it there would be no occasion for desire or emotion gener- ally" (pp. 101-102). Distance is requisite for desire, but it is desire which drives motion, guided by perception, to turn the "over there" into "here" and the "not yet" into "now." It is desire which, while seeking to efface the spatial and temporal gaps, paradoxically, maintains the gaps (and the objects across them) as matters of interest, even as the gaps are spanned under its spur. Jonas concludes: "The great secret of animal life lies precisely in the gap which it is able to maintain be- tween immediate concern and mediate satisfaction" (p. 103). Jonas then elaborates on this principle of me- diacy. Mediacy is itself an aspect of the subject-object split that distinguishes the life of mobile animals from plants and the lower animals. Plants and sessile animals derive their nourishment from the contigu- ous environment, need passing directly into satisfac- tion by the steady dynamics of metabolism; satisfac- tion is contemporaneous with elementary vital activity itself. The absence of any appreciable gap between need and satisfaction means that, in plants, life's ele- mental "self-concern" does not develop into sus- tained and experienceable appetite. But with mobile animals, the relevant environment for meeting neces- sity is always at a distance; there is therefore always some discontinuity between need and satisfaction; and there is therefore the rise of what Jonas calls "intermediate activity," actions that are separable from the ultimate vegetative or nutritional purpose. Nourishment-that is, calories for the energy bank and materials for biosynthesis, repair, and growth-is still the bottom line, but it is now detached from, and must await the result of, sighting and smelling, stalking and chasing, attacking and conquering, tear- ing, tasting, chewing, and swallowing. These interme- diate activities are distinct from the metabolic goals they serve; they even have their own inherent pleas- ures and pains. They thus constitute action in a radi- cally new sense, and provide animal life with both its enhanced freedom and its greater risk. In interme- diate activity, animals freely but also necessarily dis- pose of the accumulated resources of nutrition, seek- ing to replenish those resources but with no guaran- tee of success. The animal condition thus becomes a life of want and fear: The mediacy of animal existence . . . creates the isolated individual pitted against the world. This world is at once inviting and threaten- ing. It holds the things needed by the solitary animal, which has to go out and seek them. It also holds the objects of fear, and since the animal can flee, it must flee them .... This precarious and exposed mode of living commits to wakefulness and effort. . . . [A]lertness turns into the strain of pursuit and into the gratification of fulfillment: but it also knows the pang of hunger, the agony of fear, the anguished strain of flight.... In short, the indirectness of animal existence holds in its wakefulness the twin possibilities of enjoyment and suffering, both wedded to effort.... The suffering intrinsic in animal existence is thus primarily not that of pain . . . but of want and fear, i.e., an aspect of appetitive nature as such. . . . Animal being is thus essentially passionate being. (pp. 105- 106; emphasis added) Wakefulness and effort, want and fear, suffering and enjoyment give depth to the animal soul.</page><page sequence="7">The Legacy of Hans Jonas 1 9 The concluding section of "To Move and To Feel" is, in my view, one of the high points of the entire book. ForJonas here uses these insights about the mediacy of animal being, the freedom and en- joyment of intermediate activity, and the passionate character of animal life to rebut the widespread prejudice, foisted upon us by the evolutionary biolo- gists, that survival is the single, universal standard for judging all of life, a view which effectively ho- mogenizes and democratizes all living beings be- cause, after all, they are all in the same business: survival. Observing that, in terms of survival, motile animal life has no great advantage over plant life, and is, in any case, "bought at a heavy price," Jonas insists that "the survival standard itself is inadequate for the evaluation of life": If mere assurance of permanence were the point that mattered, life should not have started out in the first place. It is essentially precarious and corruptible being, an adven- ture in mortality, and in no possible form as assured of enduring as an inorganic body can be. Not duration as such, but "duration of what?" is the question. This is to say that such "means" of survival as perception and emotion are never to be judged as means merely, but also as qualities of the life to be preserved and therefore as aspects of the end. It is one of the paradoxes of life that it employs means which modify the end and themselves become part of it. (p. 106) The powers of intermediate activity-perceptive, emotive, motor-not only contribute to the survival of the animal. Acquiring, so to speak, a life of their own, they constitute the greater part of the being of animal life which the animal endeavors to sustain and enjoy. The question is finally not "to be or not to be?" but rather "how to (continue to) be what one is?" For each being, "to be" means "to be some- thing," to be that something-at-work, to be that some- thing-at-work seeking to manifest fully what it, as that something, truly is! For Jonas, this "something" seems to be defined largely in terms of individuality, or selfhood. Where Aristotle would have talked about animal being-or rather each animal's being-in terms of the energeia or activity of soul, appropriate to each species or kind of being, Jonas emphasizes instead the irreducibly in- dividuated mortal individual. Where Aristotle's ani- mal soul would be at-work "souling" the "soulable" aspects of the world-for example, in seeing the vis- ible or touching the tangible-Jonas's animal self en- joys its gift of precarious freedom, negotiating its own unique trajectory of life in the face of death. The true hierarchy of life is a hierarchy of selfhood, not of souling. The "real advance of developed animal- ity," Jonas says, lies in this: A more pronounced self is set over against a more pronounced world. ... In its greater ex- posure and the pitch of awareness that goes with it, its own possible annihilation becomes an object of dread just as its possible satisfac- tions become objects of desire. Its enjoyment has suffering as its shadow side, its loneliness the compensation of communication: the gain lies not on either side of the balance sheet but in the togetherness of both, i.e., in the enhancement of that selfhood with which "organism" originally dared indiffer- ent nature. Its price from the beginning was mortality, and each further stage of separa- tion pays in its own coin. . . . The kind of coin determines the value of the enterprise. The rift between subject and object, which long-range perception and motility opened and which the keenness of appetite and fear, of satisfaction and disappointment, of pleas- ure and pain, reflect, was never to be closed again. But in its widening expanse the free- dom of life found room for all those modes of relation-perceptive, active, and emo- tional-which in spanning the rift justify it and by indirection redeem the lost unity. (p. 107; emphasis added) For Jonas, the animal self is not self-contained or solipsistic; selfhood in fact comprises the various modes of relation to the world, which relations "re- deem" the lost unity between organism and environ- ment. But the self is, at bottom, anxiously self-con- cerned, because the dread of annihilation hangs over its entire being. "A more pronounced self is set over against a more pronounced [and indifferent] world." In the next chapter, Jonas draws out a crucial implication of the passionate nature of animal life. As a result he is able to rebut another prejudice of modern biology: its rejection of animal purposive- ness, of teleology. In "Cybernetics and Purpose: A Critique," he shows the error in the efforts-of cy- berneticians and behaviorists-to explain away the apparent goal-directed behavior of animals in terms of mechanical inputs and outputs and self-regulating feedback mechanisms. Exploiting the distinction be- tween "serving a purpose" and "having purpose," and using a marvelous example which compares a so-called self-steering torpedo and the same torpedo "manned" by a human pilot, he shows that all ma- chine models of purposiveness fail because, unlike living things, machines are not creatures of need. It is the concern of life with its own continued exist- ence that qualifies incoming data as "messages," and then only if they are relevant to the organism's pur- pose; it is only such self-concern that energizes the active "response" as an action fit to the organic pur- pose. Concern, or, in the higher animals, desire, ap- petite, and emotion, is more basic than the outward- looking functions of perception and locomotion which it holds together. Feedback mechanisms are thus incapable of explaining animal purposiveness; on the contrary, in living things such mechanisms presuppose and exist only to serve prior and inde- pendent animal purposes:</page><page sequence="8">A *0 ADAM AND EVE Albrecht Darer, 1504 Z^ 4 b , s T.: i....;i1 r A . 5X vBqZ *.,.li-:: . . : [D : w B t}.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</page><page sequence="9">The Legacy of Hans Jonas i 11 A feedback mechanism may be going, or may be at rest: in either state the machine exists. The organism has to keep going, be- cause to be going is its very existence-which is revocable-and, threatened with extinc- tion, it is concerned in existing. There is no analogue in the machine to the instinct of self-preservation-only to the latter's antithe- sis, the final entropy of death. (p. 126; em- phasis added) Animals, no less than man, are teleological beings; animals, no less than man, aim at their own good. "Without the concept of good, one cannot even be- gin to approach the subject of behavior" (p. 127). Appreciating Another Passionate Phenomenon of Life Jonas's account of the animal soul is powerful and revealing: animal being is essentially passionate being; animals, and especially the higher animals, are indeed more pronounced selves who live in and against a more pronounced world. Animals are in- deed purposive beings, directed to their own good. Yet there is something missing from this otherwise truthful account of rising individuality, something I happen to know Hans Jonas himself agreed was miss- ing: the specially focused kind of desire which is rooted in sexual difference. Perhaps a teacher's greatest gift to his student is the opportunity and encouragement to look critically at the teacher's teaching, the student having made it enough his own not by repeating it but by thinking it through for himself. I want to honor my teacher by taking small issue with him. As it happened, it was one of my own students who first put me on the track of this difficulty with The Phenomenon of Life. My student-Jeff Weiss is his name-reading the first page of the book was puzzled by a startling omission from the ascending list of organic powers and func- tions through which the author intends to show the progressive scale of freedom and peril, culminating in man: "Metabolism, moving and desiring, sensing and perceiving, imagination, art, and mind." "Well and good," said Weiss, "but what about reproduction? Is this not also a central power and function of living things?" The class discussed the matter at some length; in addition, we also considered how this omis- sion might affect one's view of the phenomena of life. We wondered especially whether the animal (and eventually human) sociality which follows in the wake of reproduction might not qualify greatly the view of life Jonas presents, a view which features the solitary, ever-more-well-defined individual pitted against an ever-more-defined but finally inhospitable world. Some months later, roughly fifteen years ago, I had occasion to present this difficulty to Hans, in person. After pondering the matter in silence for a brief time, he commented that this was the most se- rious and powerful objection anyone had yet raised against his account. He explained the omission in two ways. First, reproduction and sociality are not indispensable functions of life for an individual animal qua living thing; a sterile or celibate being, and even the last member of his species living on a deserted island, is nonetheless very much alive. (Here, I was reminded of the classic remark which the Nobel Lau- reate physiologist, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, once made at a conference of leading scientists, convened to work out a definition of the essence of life. When the rest of the group had reached a consensus, namely, that "life is the capacity to reproduce," Szent- Gyorgyi leapt up and objected: "In zat case, one rab- bit is dead.") But Hans's second reason was more important. I paraphrase: When I was writing this book I was still too much in the grip of the teachings of Heidegger and his view of life as (mainly) a lonely project over-against-death. Were he to rewrite the book, he said, he would make the necessary qualifi- cations and corrections. Hans never rewrote this book, so we do not have his corrected teaching on the phenomenon of life. We are left to speculate for ourselves what this might have looked like. Let me, in my own name but in honor of his spirit, offer the following beginning sug- gestions. First, we would need a more complicated ac- count of appetite and desire, even for animals. Hun- ger, the desire for food, in the service of selfpreser- vation cannot be the sole and sufficient paradigm for desire. Every animal that has acquired the sexual mode of reproduction, and especially where it re- quires copulation between the male and female in- dividuals, experiences in sexual desire an impulse whose telos is largely hidden from the animal. The animal seeks copulation, as if his goal were bodily "union," the restoration of some absent bodily whole- ness. But the true goal of this desire, invisible to the participants, is reproduction, a goal which so little serves the well-being of the reproducers as to pre- suppose their own demise. The salmon swimming up- stream to spawn and die are merely the most vivid example of this ubiquitous truth. In sex, life is not just self-centered individuality, on the contrary, sexual desire, in its deepest meaning, is self-sacrificing. Many animals, even before the coming of self-con- scious man, are bifurcated beings: on the one hand, they in large part desire their own continuation which they serve through acting on hunger and thirst; but, on the other hand, they also "desire" (un- beknownst to their experienced desires) their own re- placement. To put it sharply: any animal engaged in sex is, willy-nilly and albeit only tacitly, voting with its genitalia for its own disappearance. The full truth of sexuality is, of course, not quite as self-denying as I have suggested. On the contrary, in reproduction, life offers to existing life a different kind of transcendence, above and beyond the partial transcendence of the here and the now present to all life in its outward-reaching and forward-straining mode of being so beautifully described by Jonas. In reproduction, life has open to itself a transcendence also different in kind from the special kind of tran- scendence which mind makes possible for man, in</page><page sequence="10">12 I Hastings Center Report, Special Issue, 1995 the form of thoughts, deeds, works of art, and other projects that, at least potentially, may reach beyond the grave. In reproduction, as Aristotle noted long ago, animals and even plants have an opportunity to leave behind another like themselves, "participating in the eternal in the only way they can." In the case of animals with two separate sexes, participation in reproduction means not only a bi- furcated condition of inner desire, it also means a more complicated and richer relation to the outer world. For these beings, the world is no longer ac- curately characterizable as indifferent and largely ho- mogeneous other, in part edible, in part dangerous, but on the whole alien. From the point of view of the sheer necessity of self-preservation and its appe- tite, hunger, the world comprises some beings or their products which you can destroy and devour, turning other into same, other beings who will do unto you what you hungrily do unto others, and a vast sea of indifference that pays you no notice and contributes not at all to your own continuance and well-being. But from the point of view of reproduc- tion and its half-blind-appetite, lust for union, the world also contains some very special, related but complementary beings, members of the same kind but of opposite sex, toward whom one reaches out with special interest and intensity. It is not altogether a "self-opposed,to-world" kind of world; it is a world of largely separated and self-interested selves who nonetheless seek and find and know their comple- mentary selves in order to do the somewhat nonself- ish work of replacing themselves. It follows that the form of each animal must be understood not only in contrast to its own transient materials; it must also be understood in its likeness to the form of other related, conspecific animals. For the shape-and-looks, the morphe-kai-eidos, of each animal defines its species being, no less than its individuated being. To think of the phenomenon of life separate from its repro- ductive whither and whence is to homogenize the outer world and to exaggerate its loneliness. When the power of sight reaches to near matur- ity in the higher birds and mammals, the outward gaze keeps an outlook not only for prospective food and threatening predators, but also for possible mates. The outward look of the conspecific counter- part makes a specific impression, arousing sexual in- terest. Here the beholding of form is suffused with desire, in the animal antecedent of human eros, a subject much too large to consider here in any depth. I content myself with only one observation which most powerfully shows what is humanly at stake in the account of life, with and without sexual desire. According to Heidegger, human self-conscious- ness is fundamentally consciousness of mortality. Death, the horrible mystery of extinction, is the first problem of life, and anxiety before death is the con- stitutive attitude of the human condition. But accord- ing to Genesis, man became man when he became self-conscious not of his mortality but of his sexuality, of the uncanny and mysterious doubleness in his (animal) soul. He became human-rather they be- came human, man and woman together-when each saw through the eyes of the other the fact (and mean- ing) of their nakedness. Each discovered the true meaning of being in need of the complementary other who is, in fact, not just a missing part of one- self, as the man had said (flesh of my flesh), but a genuinely independent being; each discovered the presence of unruly desires within that want some- thing of us that we don't understand; each became aware that these infirmities are quite evident to the sexual other, from whom, therefore, each now wants not only sexual gratification but also approval and admiration. From the discovery of shame-filled naked- ness comes much of civilization, beginning with the arts of concealment and beautification (the needle and the fig leaf). In turn, clothing and adornment, by means of refusal and its effects on the imagination, transform animal lust into human eros, which takes wings from the recognition that there are higher possibilities for man than the finally unfulfilling acts of bodily fusion. Among these possibilities are the establishments of long-lived familial societies, grounded in the aware- ness that sex means children, that human children need long-term rearing including rearing for social- ity, morality, and love, and that children are indeed life's (partial) answer to mortality. Now all of this Hans Jonas knew and, I want to say, knew in his bones. On few subjects was he more eloquent than on the wisdom of finitude and the redemptive possibility of perpetuation, a possibility, because now become precarious, he made the cor- nerstone of his teaching of responsibility. This, I sus- pect, he learned not from Heidegger but from a more loving and just tradition which informed his life and thought beyond what he was able to put explicitly into The Phenomenon of Life. His love of life and humankind and his love of the right and the good are in fact present throughout the book, in his own passionate voice. And the non-Heideggerian truth which Hans Jonas embodied actually does find one noticeable, powerful, and articulate expression in The Phenomenon of Life, the dedication to his wife which greets the reader when he or she first opens the book. These beautiful words were, indeed, my very first introduction to Hans Jonas, and, quite frankly, won me over at the start. Each time I read or remember them-as, indeed, each time I read anything that he wrote-I smile and rejoice in the memory of this rare man in whose passionate and thoughtful and loving life the phenomenon of life found such exalted expression.
