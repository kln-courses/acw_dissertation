Philadel phia, PA, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, xvi, 270 pp., 215 figs., incl. CD-ROM with 220 plates. Pr. $59.95. Etruscan myths cannot only be considered a reflection of Greek myths, as Nancy T. de Grummond (De G.) states. Many elements and even complete stories are of Etruscan origin (e.g. Tages). According to De G. we have to identify as many ele ments that are authentically Etruscan as possible in iconographical sources (repre sentations on mirrors, urns, gems; statuettes with inscriptions, etc.). She uses the internal combinatory approach, the same method as is used in the study of the Etruscan language. This implies that scenes with similar content are compared. De G. tries to interpret scenes from the Etruscan perspective, not "by way of the Greeks" (pp. 12-8). In addition, she uses the method of comparative (Indo-European) mythology in order to understand which myths were represented and why. She stresses that "scholars should stop trying to judge Etruscan representations of myths on whether they are consistent with Greek texts" (p. 238). In my opinion, however, scenes of Greek origin would not be understandable without texts. According to De G. we have to realize that although many Greek and Italic/ Roman gods were syncretized with those of the Etruscans, the original Etruscan deities can be very different. Therefore, De G. decides to use only the Etruscan names of these gods. A table lists the Greek and Roman equivalents of the Etrus can deities. Since our main sources of Etruscan myths are visual representations, the char acter of the book is highly iconographical. This is because Etruscan written sources on myths are absent (except for some didaskalia, short narrative inscriptions that accompany mythological scenes). De G. does not avoid using Greek and Roman visual and literary sources, but tries to use these sources in a critical way, sifting the elements that are consistent with internal Etruscan evidence. De G. states that text and image in Greece for example, but also in Etruria, have to be considered as two independently developing worlds. On several occasions De G. points to remark able parallels between Etruscan mythology on the one hand and Norse and Italic/ Roman mythology on the other. However, the main problem with her methodology is this: when is a mytho logical representation really Etruscan? Many mirrors, for example, show as core scene a Greek myth supplemented by original Etruscan gods, personifications and couleur locale (e.g., the Birth of Menerva is flanked by two Etruscan birth god desses or two martial gods). In these cases one could better speak about interpreta tio Etrusca than about Etruscan myths. Here follows a synopsis of the structure and contents of the book. Chapter I (pp. 1-21) provides the reader with a short introduction to the Etruscans, useful ?

Stevens I Mnemosyne 62 (2009) 347-350 for students and non-Etruscologists. De G. deals with geography, chronology, sources, methodology (for which see above), the usages of myth, and the nature of the gods. Human figures were represented from the eighth century BCE onwards. Ini tially scenes had a generic character, such as hunting scenes. One of the first pos sibly mythological representations is visible on a bronze burial urn from Bisenzio from the end of the eighth century BCE: the lid shows a group of bronze figurines representing two rows of warriors dancing around an enchained monster. A simi lar kind of monster, a wolf or man with wolf cap, is also present on Hellenistic urns, a fact that, according to De G., leads to the conclusion that the Bisenzio urn could represent one of the first local myths. The problem, in my opinion, is not only that the gap between the urn of Bisenzio and the Hellenistic urns is ca. 500 years, but also that the monster on the bronze urn is not a wolf, but rather an embryo-like death demon (cf. the monster on a horse on the famous Etrusco Corinthian Truia vase, not mentioned in this book). Strangely enough, De G. calls the urns 'Hellenistic', while she criticizes the term a few pages later. The majority of the epigraphic and non-epigraphic bronze mirrors with mythological representations, the main source used in the book under review, date from ca. 500-ca. 275 BCE. Mirrors were usually made for and used by women and frequently buried along with them. The use of myths in Etruria was manifold: entertainment but also expression of social values (e.g., brides preparing for marriage), archetypal representations of a certain social or religious activity (e.g., Tages revealing the Etrusca disciplina), so called charter myths. A large percentage of Etruscan myth may have had, accord ing to De G., a direct religious meaning. Although this is difficult to prove because of the fact that little is known about Etruscan politics, it cannot be excluded that some myths can be interpreted in a political way. The last paragraph of the first chapter deals with the nature of the gods. Before the anthropomorphic deities came into being, Etruscan gods seem to have been numina. Anthropomorphic gods can be doubled or tripled (e.g. the infant Maris on two mirrors) or change sex, especially gods that are unknown in Greek myth. Chapters II to X are based on?mainly?iconographical sources. De G. starts with The Prophets (Chapter II, pp. 23-40), extremely important in Etruscan reli gion, proceeds with Creation, Time and the Universe (Chapter III, pp. 41-51), The Principal God of Etruria (Chapter IV, pp. 53-70), Great Goddesses (Chapter V, pp. 71-112), More Gods (Chapter VI, pp. 113-45), Spirits (Chapter VII, pp. 147 72), Heroes and Heroines (Chapter VIII, pp. 173-99), Foundation Myths and Legends (Chapter IX, pp. 201-7), and finishes with Afterlife and Underworld (Chapter X, pp. 209-33).</page><page sequence="3">De novis libris iudicia I N.L. C. Stevens / Mnemosyne 62 (2009) 347-350 349 Themes of prophecy seem to be important, especially in and around Orvieto in the fourth and third centuries BCE. The themes are of Etruscan origin (Tages, Cacu, Lasa Vecuvia), but also Etruscan interpretations of Greek figures (Calchas, Orpheus, Silenus and Medusa) and Latin figures (e.g. Albunea and Juno Sospita). According to De G. the Etruscan Cacu and the Roman Cacus and his sister Caca are related (pp. 27-30, 173-5, 203-5), but this is unlikely, not only because the Roman stories about Cacus and Caca differ radically from the Etruscan story, as De G. admits herself, but also on linguistic grounds: Cacus would be Cace in Etruscan, not Cacu. At least one myth about creation exists: the story of the nymph Vegoia (Lasa V?cu (via) in Etruscan iconography) in the Latin translation of an Etruscan text, in which its nature is revealed. The concept of ten Etruscan saecula and ritual calen dars are discussed briefly. A Latin text by Martianus Capella (fifth century CE) and the Piacenza Liver (third or second century BCE) have been used for the reconstruction of the universe (caelum), divided into sixteen regions, dwelling places of one or more gods. The principal god of Etruria is Tinia. His names and functions are discussed in Chapter IV. The major Etruscan goddesses (Menrva (Athena/Minerva), Uni (Hera/Juno), Turan (Aphrodite/Venus), Artumes (Artemis/Diana), Catha (Daughter of the Sun?), Cel Ati (Mother Earth), Thesan (Dawn)) are dealt with in Chapter V, Fufluns (Dionysos/Bacchus), Turms (Hermes/Mercury), Usil (Sun), Suri (Apollo Soranus), Tiv (Moon), Sethlans (Hephaistos/Vulcan), Laran (Ares/Mars), the enigmatic deity Maris, and Nethuns (Poseidon/Neptune) in Chapter VI. Secondary or intermediary divine beings are dealt with in Chapter VII; heroes like the Vipinas brothers, Hercle, the Tinas Cliniar ('sons of Tinia', Dioskouroi) are the subject of Chapter VIII. Wlien dealing with the Vipinas brothers De G. misinterprets the scene on the alabaster urn from Sarteano (p. 176, fig. VIII.3). Although a similar scheme has been used, this scene does not represent Cacu taken captive by the brothers, but Orestes and Pylades taken captive at the sanctu ary of Artemis in the land of the Taurians, where Orestes' sister Iphigenia has become priestess. Iphigenia, the female figure on the left, holds a letter in her hand that reveals the identity of her prisoners. The letter does not make sense in the story of Cacu. In addition, Cacu's lyre is missing! The urn should be dated to the second half of the third instead of the second century BCE. No representations of 'founders of the Etruscan people' are known, and the only?often contradictory?foundation stories are written by Greek and Latin authors. These sources amongst other topics are dealt with in Chapter IX. The last Chapter is dedicated to the archaeological and literary evidence con cerning rituals and beliefs about the afterlife and Underworld.</page><page sequence="4">350 De novis libris iudicia ?N.L. C. Stevens ?Mnemosyne 62 (2009) 347-350 An appendix on Etruscan mythology provides a useful guide to further reading on the subject, since all major publications from Gerhard, E., Kl?gmann, A., K?rte, G. 1840-1897. Etruskische Spiegel (Berlin) until De Grummond, N.T., Simon, E. (eds.) 2006. The Religion of the Etruscans (Austin, TX) are being discussed. In some cases, the presentation of the material might have been better. For instance, some myths and legends, like those dealing with Cacu, are not dealt with in a systematic, chronological way. Comments on illustrations, focusing on gods and spirits (often personifications), are rather short. In addition, Cacu and Epiur are repeatedly dealt with in different chapters. A positive point is that some recently discovered representations are dealt with. In many cases, however, De G. states that specialists have put forward unconvinc ing interpretations, which she does not summarize or of which she does not indi cate the weak arguments, without giving a new, better interpretation, as her hypotheses cannot be tested by non-iconographic information (pp. 27, 138, 175, 188, 199). A fundamental question is this: which Etruscan myth would we know if the Etruscans had not borrowed Greek myths? Very few: the Pava Tarchies, Alpunea, Epiur, Maris, Mez(e)ntie, Mlacuch and Malavisch representations are not completely explained. Curiously, even in these local myths Greek and Italic elements are present! De G. interprets Maris as Genius. However, G. Colonna has proven that Etruscan Farthan means Genius. Finally, one minor detail: in the transcription of the Piacenza Liver inscriptions under fig. III.la, b and c all theta's and the chi of velch have been replaced by "s" by mistake. To conclude: this book is highly informative about Etruscan gods, spirits and heroes and the adaptation or transformation of originally Greek myths into semi-Etruscan ones. 215 illustrations of high quality and a CD-ROM con taining an archive of 220 Images of Etruscan Mythology complete this elaborate book. A wide variety of users will benefit from it: Etruscologists, especially stu dents, classicists who study the mythology of ancient Greece and Italy, and schol ars of world myth.
